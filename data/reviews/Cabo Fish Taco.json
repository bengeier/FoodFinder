{"text":"I've always been leery about fish tacos and have yet to find a good one. Cabo's Fish Tacos are one word, \"AMAZING\"! I ordered there Honey Soy Glazed Salmon Tacos and they had the perfect seasoning and very tender. I also had the Carne Asada Tacos. If you are a beef eater you can't go wrong with these tacos. Again, seasoned perfectly and although the beef was cut in chunks they were still tender juicy pieces. And the spicy guacamole pasta as a side was probably one of the best pasta salads I've ever had. This restaurant gets a perfect score from me. I will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I have ever had. Can't wait to go back! Only draw back would be the wait and the small bar area. Yummmm.."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place based on \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" but have tried it twice and both times the place was WAY too loud to enjoy/talk/share...it was a nightmare of noise, with awful thumping music coupled with shouting clientele.  Food is very unremarkable, with a staff that is very young and not clued in.  I asked for blackened fish but got gooey drippy bbq sauce all over...and portions were not great.  The only positive was the salsa.  Not worth it, as there are much better Mexican joints where you can actually hold a conversation and enjoy your friends while you eat great Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have had some good experiences and some bad. Customer service tends to be unimpressive, at best. The first time I went there I was with a friend who lived in the area. Minutes after sitting down, one of the hostesses literally threw a piece of folded paper at my friend. It asked if she was not on a date, would she like to go out with said hostess. Super unprofessional, especially at the beginning of a meal. The second time, I asked the server if the beans were prepared or merely tossed in a dish, he responded \"well don't all beans come from a can?\" and walked away. Service the rest of the night was slow despite it being low volume and the server continued to be rude when faced with questions or requests. Will not be returning. Poor quality food and awful service."}
{"text":"I have been here 5+ times now and it never disappoints. Cabo remains one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte and while you can always count on waiting 30 minutes+ for a table, it is always worth it. The Tavarua tacos are the best thing on the menu. Have a wasabi sauce that is unforgettable."}
{"text":"Cabo has done so well because it is one of the few watering holes in a trendy area--NODA has a really, really long way to go, and I've never been quite sure what the appeal is, but if you want a see-be-seen spot or a place to catch a taco and stale chips (why are they always stale? always.) after a yoga class at the Y, this works. It's loud, it's a place to say you went. The shrimp tacos are pretty good, but it's hard to screw up fried food."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this Charlotte staple. The lemon grilled tacos and beer battered shrimp tacos are amazing. The soft taco shells are actually my favorite, so much better than anywhere else! You also get a side with the tacos, jalepeno mashers or baja rice are my go to. They ahve a great selection of margs and beer, too! Because it's such a great spot, it can get pretty crowded making the wait long and it can get a little loud inside which is not ideal for deep conversations."}
{"text":"Great lunch at Cabo. Enjoyed the white fish and carna asada tacos. The flour tortillas are lightly fried and stuffed. The local craft beers are little pricy but food is excellent.  The waiter failed to mention that you can mix and max tacos.  Avocado pasta salad was creamy pasta salad with avocados."}
{"text":"I've been twice, and driven by and not stopped a couple as well. Apparently this place gets busy on the weekend evenings. Not sure I'd wait an hour to eat here, but it is perfect when it's not busy. We were seated quickly, they have tap beer, and the bartender was super chill.   The portions are pretty big. My gf and I both got an entree, and we left will plenty of leftovers. The new standby is splitting the shrimp tacos (especially by the time you eat the corn salsa, chips, beer, etc!).  People do bring their kids here sometimes, so you may want to poke your head in and see if you're gonna wait 45 minutes to sit next to a screaming toddler..."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan. Ate lunch with a client there. The place was busy and that was enough to get his attention off the fact that I didn't take him to a \"fine dining\" (expensive) establishment."}
{"text":"Horrendous service and attitude from both waitress and management. I was expecting a Williamsburg feel (as I live in nyc) but unfortunately that's not the case. Extremely poor service. Do not recommend to anyone. Stay away. Also should add this may have been due to me being a minority as I was the only none white person in the entire place except the waitress. Disappointing"}
{"text":"I expected a lot more from a dish that is the namesake of a restaurant. That's some greasy, flavorless fish, CFT. For shame. While I commend you for giving me a lot of food, it simply was not good.  I also have an issue with the corn salsa that come with the chips at the table. I love corn salsa IN a dish. But, it makes for some seriously awkward dipping with just chips.   The kernels...they were...everywhere."}
{"text":"Beans or rice or both way too salty and when meal went virtually uneaten, it was not even questioned.  Also ridiculous  price for a bean and cheese burrito -- $10 bucks -- are you kidding me??   And the chips were completely stale."}
{"text":"Was wrestling between a 3 or 4 for Cabo Fish Taco, but I give it a 4 because of the fun factor and that I'll definitely be a returning customer.  The restaurant is on a lively street in the NoDa area, surrounded by other restaurants and bars.  It reminds me of some of the neighborhoods back home in Chicago.  We stopped in around 7 on a Saturday night and there was already a line formed to talk to the hostess.  They informed us that it would be an hour, which wasn't a problem.  We expect waits like that on a Saturday night, plus there are a bunch of bars to go grab a drink or two while you wait.  Also, the wait only ended up being about 30 minutes.      Ambience/Space:  4  A very loud, energetic space with island type music playing.  This is a great place for groups that want to go out, slam some drinks and have a good time.  They also have a small outdoor seating area which is great for nice nights.    Service:  3.5  Hostess was very nice and texted us when our table was ready.  Our waiter was pretty standard, more interested in just taking our order and moving on.  Again, it was packed and he was very busy, so no big deal.    Chips/Salsa:  3  The salsa was a pico that tasted very fresh, but I would've preferred a little more spice.  The chips were pretty run of the mill, nothing special.  Entree:  4  I had the two tacos and a side dish.  I tried the white fish taco and the carne asada tacos.  I really liked both.  They had a lot of flavor, but the thing that sealed it for me were the shells.  I chose the rice & beans side, and unfortunately that fell a little flat for me.  It didn't have much flavor or spice to it.  Next time I'll probably try a different side.     Margarita:  3  To be fair, I only tried their house margarita that comes with Cuervo.  It was pretty good, but next time I'll probably go for a different version.  I think they have something like 16 different margaritas, ranging from cheap ($5), to skinny, to flavored, to premium.  It really is a pretty cool margarita list."}
{"text":"Loved eating here when I was in college and was glad to find one in charlotte. The BBQ mahi tacos are worth every penny"}
{"text":"A lot of hype. Tacos are ok. Drinks are great! Service depends, sometimes its great and sometimes its slow."}
{"text":"I have visited Cabo Fish Taco several times and it is hard to find a bad thing to say. The food is awesome , the service is fun and great and the atmosphere is very chill. I suppose the only negative is that the place is always packed.. You are better off to get there at 5pm and eat early then to attempt to go later."}
{"text":"Wow, I was impressed. I ordered the blackened mahi mahi fish tacos. They were delicious.  I was really impressed. The salsa that is brought to the table was also excellent. I will definitely go back and I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My first time trying fish tacos. The BBQ mahi tacos from Cabo are delicious! Service was great too. I'll be coming here every time I come to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The food was light, fresh, flavorful, and had a very unique twist. It's a very laid-back atmosphere with friendly, down to earth staff. It's a must try kind of place that will easily make your rotation of favorite places to dine."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Guacamole tasted like crap. $7 !!!  For a tiny bowl of doo doo. Chips were stale and the tacos tasted old. Would not return."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fish tacos I have ever opened my mouth to. I had the lemon grilled tuna tacos (not the ones with wasabi) with Mexican slaw and it was filling, delicious and unlike anything I've ever bit into before."}
{"text":"I am a big fish taco fan, and to my disappointment this place did not live up to the hype. Food was just average. Margaritas are just alright. The ingredients seemed cheap. Perhaps their fame comes from being the only Mexican restaurant in NoDa, I wouldn't dare to say it is because of their food. I had the blackened mahi mahi signature tacos and  \"meh\" is all I have to say. Best fish tacos? Seriously?? Only if you have low fish tacos standards."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Cabo for a couple years and I would say it's definitely a favorite of mine for fresh fish tacos in Charlotte! My personal experience has been that coming on an off peak day or time has made for the best tacos. Friday or Saturday nights can have a wait upwards of an hour but the hostess has always been friendly, either offering a seat at the bar, or taking your number to text you when your table is available. This is super convenient if you want to hit one of the other NoDa bars for a beer before dinner.   On my most recent visit (an early Sunday night, around 6:30), we were seated immediately and had great service. I ordered the Lemon Grilled Shrimp tacos with the Nopolita Salad as my side. We also enjoyed some guac to start. Paired with a local Birdsong Jalapeño Pale Ale, it was a great dinner all around! I'll definitely be back. Also a favorite spot to bring out of town visitors!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  Very acommodating to my gluten dairy free issues.  I had the Lemon shrimp tacos and my husband had the chicken burrito.  Chips and salsa was good.....a bit spicy but good.  The avocado pasta salad was also good.  Would try this place again for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't know why other places in town even put fish tacos on their menus. Cabo Fish Taco can not be beat! I've been a fan for years and there is no better meal than chips and freshly prepared salsa before an order of their signature fish tacos (nix the cabbage) and side of baja rice. All washed down with one of their inexpensive, yet effective, margaritas, the el cheapo. All for less than $15! It's a meal that satisfies and transports you miles away, to a place with sand between your toes and worries washed away to sea."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte!  Excellent fish tacos and Margueritas!  The Perfect Wave is a must try. Delicious. Fun walking around the area and visiting the shops, too."}
{"text":"Ugh, stale chips mixed in w/ fresh chips. That's weak. My wife whose gluten intolerant, asked for corn tortillas since it's a taco place and the waitress said all they had was flour tortillas. I ordered the special which had green peppers in the tacos. Since I'm not a fan of green peppers I requested the special w/ out the peppers.  Five mins. later the waitress came back and said the \"chef\" couldn't take the peppers off my tacos as the special was a \"pre-mix\". Pre-mix?! It's a damn taco, not French bouillabaisse! Once I heard that I knew I'd never eat here again. The food was decent but I'm not going back again."}
{"text":"The food was decent. I had the BBQ Mahi Taco which I felt were too saucy. The chips were stale."}
{"text":"So good. If you are in Charlotte you should come here- although getting a table may be difficult. It's loud and crowded, but the food is so worth it"}
{"text":"I'm from California and it's really hard to find great Mexican food in Charlotte.  Cabo Fish Taco is as good, if not better than any California Mexican restaurant that I've been to."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Great food. Great service/people. The only downside is that this place is always busy!"}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of CFT and used to go here all the time. I used to line their food. Now, it's all gone down hill. I don't know what happened. Every time I've eaten there recently it's terrible. Cold sides, stale chips, fish not fresh... Recently I got the veggie fajitas. I'm still gagging thinking about it. Tastes like old Chinese food (yeah,not Mexican) that had been sitting in a styrofoam box in the fridge for a week then heated up in the microwave. It was so gross. I didn't finish it. So last week I went there (why? Not sure) and I got a simple vegetable wrap with some ranch sauce and a side of fruit. The fruit tasted fine, not freshly cut but maybe like pre cut my Harris teeter or something. Anyway I started feeling an upset stomach after the first part of the wrap. I boxed the other half and took it home. I tried to finish it at home and within 30 minutes I was projectile vomiting. It lasted the entire day. I threw up around 25 times that day. I have never felt so sick. That food was the first and only thing I ate that day and I never ever throw up usually. I couldn't keep anything down the entire day, not even water or medicine, I felt like dying and that wrap poisoned me! Definitely my last experience at cabo will be connected with some brutal food poisoning memories. Ew"}
{"text":"I've been there once and loved it!  The fish tacos are delish and who doesn't like a nice little trip to NoDa?"}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times. First time the food was bland, cold, and my tortillas were soggy. The service was ok. The second time was just terrible. Service was horrid. Our server didn't check on us at all, our drinks were never refilled, she dropped our check off and picked it up without saying anything. The food was unforgivable. Greasy, overcooked, and tasted like water this place has never heard of salt. I had to season my food and add citrus to my fish tacos. My side of rice and beans were cold, undercooked, and had no seasoning. The corn salsa was served with cold ships and once again no seasoning. I usually never leave bad reviews being that I work as a server in a restaurant in uptown and also as a cook/kitchen manager in another restaurant in uptown. But this was just shameful to everyone in the restaurant industry...."}
{"text":"This was about my third visit to Cabo and just like the first few times I wasn't impressed by the food. I ordered the shrimp & chicken burrito, despite the contents it was pretty dry and lacked seasoning. The chips and pico dip were equally mediocre with what tasted like borderline stale chips. The only reason for three stars is the servers were especially nice and I did enjoy one of the tacos from a previous trip. If I want good tacos, this wouldn't be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"The Mahi tacos are wonderful and I would return for the food but not the service. The tacos were fresh, delicious, and came quickly but only when the waitress decided to finally take our order. I attended at a time when there were only a few people at the bar and one other table and the waitress was too busy talking to co-workers rather than helping customers. They were well staffed at the time especially considering the small crowd that was there. I'm going to try to go there again during a busier time and hopefully the service will be as good as the food."}
{"text":"Great food, casual atomosphere and cool location."}
{"text":"I never ask to speak to a manager but I almost did. The service was a fail. Not a \"sorry\" for messing up two orders and dropping ( wasn't rang in) one, but a simple \"oh\". Refills was like a DMV experience. Food is great but at some point it's not worth it. I hate broda and don't frequent the neighborhood because I don't enjoy the people that live and frequent these haunts. Cabo was the exception. Was. Two stars just because the food is good. As someone that makes his living as a server it erks me when I'm treated this way. Apathy has no place when it comes to service."}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco fails us again.  Been here many times now and the service never impresses. It was so loud in the restaurant we could hardly have a conversation at the table  I ordered the chicken and shrimp burrito. It was great tasting and accurate. BUT! We also ordered fish tacos and not to my surprise it came out with shrimp on it. I don't know where the gap in communication is with this restaurant, something is always askew. The many times I have gone they have given me the wrong food. It's a shame the service is so poor because the food is delicious. I can't say that I'll return again soon to find out if this is a fluke or your norm."}
{"text":"Cabo has been receiving a lot of mixed review lately. Some say that the food has been over hyped and that the food didn't live up to it. Today I dined At Cabo Fish taco and I must say that most (not all things) were actually really delicious.  I'Ve been to Cabo many many times and for the most part I loved it. Today was no different. We walked in around 5 and was sat quickly. We ordered The Cabo Roll and Blackened Mahi Tacos. We got the signature corn salsa and chips which would have been been nice if they were a little warm. The salsa needed a little salt. Overall I like the jazzed up idea of the corn salsa. There has been dispute about how they don't get the whole non-tomato based salsa idea. Well let me tell you this: most restaurants that offer a salsa that is slightly blended usually arrives via sysco trucks in a jug labeled Pace Picante. Im all for FRESH foods, not a product that is heated and cooled and shipped thousands of miles!  The Cabo roll was filled with cheese and rather large chunks of both crab and shrimp. It was tasty but the guac needed onions, lime juice and instead of rolling the ball in cilantro it should have been mixed in. maybe a little salt too. As always the tacos are always a favorite. My personal fav is the Diablo shrimp, today however we ordered, and loved the blackened mahi mahi. The fish was perfectly cooked not dry or over cooked at all!!!  I absolutely love their sour cream and lime sauce they use on almost everything... nom nom nom.  I know service is kinda wonky but today they were on par.  love Cabo will be back.!"}
{"text":"Wow, what happened Cabo? The food was so beyond inedible this evening. Not one person in my group left satisfied nor with any more than a few bites of their food eaten. Fish wasn't cooked all the way through. The carne asada meat was tough to chew, like chewing on leather, and lifeless in flavors. Tortillas were hard. Spicy avocado pasta tasted like it was made a week ago and refrigerated. I used to love the chips and salsa here but the chips were stale and the salsa was lacking its usual spice. Our bill was close to $80 for four people... That price does not justify the quality of the food we received. Server hardly returned to see how we were doing. On top of that, she kept change from the cash we handed her for the bill.. Possibly assuming it was her tip?? When should you ever assume though? Had to hunt her down to ask for the change after waiting for her to return for about 10 minutes then she acted like we were being rude or an inconvenience... I've never encountered these types of problems here or had a meal that was this subpar here... Really disappointed. Hopefully next time I decide to return I'll be able to add more stars but it'll definitely be awhile before I come back."}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco is a pretty good place. Personally, I love the queso but the food has just never been flavorful enough for me. The flavors never really mesh together in a way that's like...\"good GOD I HAVE to come back for this specific entree\" Definitely a place to try out for yourself though! Although it may not be my cup of tea it may be yours!"}
{"text":"Cabo is my favorite restaurant in all of Charlotte. Period. I have enjoyed every taco I've ever eaten here, which is many. The tacos are packed full of delicious, perfectly cooked fish and fillings. You definitely don't leave here hungry! The grilled salmon tacos and tavarua tacos are to die for! The only downside is that the wait is super long on weekends and they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"This place has the quickest service with the best food. I ordered the Tuna tacos.  Heater, our waitress was great.  She provided great recommendations and prompt service.  Thanks for a great experience   DT"}
{"text":"The tortillas for the tacos were by far the best part.  Delicious.  I am sure that the tacos were very authentic, but all of the dishes were a bit heavy on cilantro to me.  Next time around maybe I can ask that they hold cilantro.  I realize this next comment might sound crazy, but the Mahi was a bit too fishy to me.  In my experience, well-cooked Mahi isn't all that fishy. Check out the queso though, and enjoy the tortillas."}
{"text":"You know, you'd think that after giving a restaurant 2 stars, I would stop going.  Me and Cabo are like You and That Lover; you just can't let go even though you know it's not good for either of you.    It's a mystery to me.  I think maybe I fantasize about the prices lowering themselves by half. Or the food improving itself by half (either way suits me).  I think I just really need a Baja Mex restaurant to fill a void and I keep going back to Cabo.  There are a couple of things that are ok.  Like that one server with a cute....oh I'll stop.  Not even a cute butt is consistent there.   Oh well.  I keep trying.  Trying to fill that void.  Trying to understand.   Does anyone else have that restaurant they don't understand why they patron? Could this go in a self help article?  Maybe I would sign my name, \"searching for tacos in all the wrong places\".  But that's it! Sometimes I think I like the atmosphere............?????"}
{"text":"Visited Cabo Sunday at 1:00 PM. Place was packed to the gills. Got seated (party of 7) in less than 7 minutes. Service was incredible, food was expertly prepared and beautifully presented and we were served faster than McDonalds. I was amazed at their organization which flowed gracefully our entire visit. Our waiter never let our glasses get low but didn't hover. He was very kind to our 2children and treated everyone with upmost respect. I would give Cano 7 of 5 stars if I could. This was many of our parties first visit but you can be sure we will return every chance we get. Their creative,relaxing, decor and attention to detail is a true gift to NoDa and great reason to visit this part of Charlotte. I can't wait to visit other businesses in this part of town. CUDOS"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, and a must when you're in Charlotte. The food is fresh and the staff is very friendly.  If you want the best bloody Mary you've ever had, ask for Charles to make it."}
{"text":"Don't know what all the rave reviews are for. Had fish tacos today for lunch and they were bland - like having fish & chips on a tortilla, except the fish in real fish & chips is better. Also had soup - chicken & jalapeno; also boring, though better when we added some of the corn relish and some bottled hot sauce. Everything needed salt - and more flavor.  And what's up with no salsa on the table, just a corn & tomato relish? Which was mostly corn.  My fish tacos are way better! Can't believe Guy Fieri liked this place - he usually has better taste. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"We have been there several time since we relocated in Charlotte 18 month ago. We have never been disappointed with Cabo Fish Taco. That place is great, has good fresh food, a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. You may have to be patient to get a seat that place is packed early for dinner during weekend. You'd better come for lunch, or for dinner on a working day to avoid queueing to get a table."}
{"text":"You know when you finish a meal and you think man I just wasted a lot of calories and it wasn't worth it that pretty much sums up Cabo Fish taco not sure why people love it so much tried it many times in the beginning they were great but every time I go back to fall in love again I think man I hate wasting calories"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here today after hearing good things about the place.   We were disappointed.  Although the service was fast and our waitress was very nice, the food was mediocre.  Firstly, the guacamole was obviously out of a container.  We suspected that they use the exact same pre-made brand that you find in the grocery store.    They tossed some fresh chopped onions and some other stuff on top, but they weren't fooling anyone.  (By the way, the charged more than 6 bucks for the stuff.)  Secondly, the chips they served were stale and under-salted.  Thirdly, the refried beans were also out of a can.   They had the EXACT taste and texture of the Old El Paso brand refried beans that you can pick up in any grocery store for $0.99 a can.   Of course, Cabo will charge you considerably more.  Finally, we have to talk about the fish tacos.   We tried 4 varieties of their tacos, and they were all bland and uninspired.   The fish was overcooked, the sauces were just gross.  They used fried flour shells and cheddar instead of traditional corn tortillas and cojita or queso fresco (which would be the more authentic way to go with this sort of fair).  Personally I didn't mind the flour shells, but my wife thought it was blasphemy.  Lastly, a word to the chef:   Wasabi and Mustard are not the same thing.  -- The honey-wasabi sauce tasted exactly like the spicy mustard you get from a chinese restaurant (which is generally just ground mustard mixed with water).  I could be wrong- maybe the other flavors screwed up my taste buds- but that tasted just like any generic honey mustard sauce.  I don't mean to bash these guys too much.   The meal wasn't awful- it was just awful for the price.  Also, I need to knock down their rating a little bit, because they just don't deserve their current 3.5 stars on Yelp.  My wife wants you to know that you can get better food at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Ate here while visiting Charlotte for the week after seeing all the reviews. All I can say is, Amazing. I love how you can pick any two tacos and mix and match them. Salsa was on point, beer selection was great, service was excellent. Had no idea what to get since it was my first time there, but the waiter was more than helpful and gave me plenty of suggestions. It is kind of pricey, but the food is worth it. Also, they have plenty of tvs for any of your sports needs. I definitely will be a regular once moving."}
{"text":"Meh.  This place is all the rage is NoDa, but it's never done anything for me. I guess it's just not my bag, baby. There are several other places in the area where I'd rather eat and hang out. You should definitely check it out for yourself, as again, most people LOVE it. I've just never had a meal I was crazy about, and the service doesn't stand out either."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things before I tried this place. After trying, my feeling is just three star. Nothing impressive."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings for this place.  I've been here 2 times.  I got the blackened mahi mahi fish tacos and they were very good.  The avocado pasta salad is also very good.  I got the refried beans before and they are a meh.  The cheese dip is very good.  We ordered the guacamole today and we were not fans of it.  My husband ordered the bbq mahi mahi tacos and loved them but he found a fish bone in it..and he also found something mysterious and hard in his refried beans (it looked like a fish bone but I don't know how it would have ended up in refried beans!).  Also tried the tomatillo salsa the first time we went and it was horrible..the whole table couldn't eat it.  The corn salsa they bring out with the chips is alright.  Basically a lot of hits and misses but the main attraction (the fish tacos) are very good.  I'm just a little turned off by the fish bone and more so the mysterious hard thing in my husbands refried beans. I think I may stick with the fish tacos at Phat Burrito. They put mango salsa on it and also have a fresh salsa bar with at least 6 or 7 different salsas on it."}
{"text":"I went wtih two local friends and an out of towner last night to Cabo Fish Taco. We had an amazing time. They have a great beer list that we checked out during a brief wait at the bar for a table. Our server Brittany was fun and incredibly efficient. She was patient while we laughed and talked and ignored the menu as well. We split their queso which was a hit all the way around. I had one of their specials which was a snapper taco and picked the refried beans and rice as my side and it was fantastic. All of us loved our meals and will definitely be back. It's a great, fun spot while you are out and about in NoDa."}
{"text":"The food and selection is good. Having been to Cabo and raised in LA, my standards for the lowly fish taco are actually pretty high. This one was good. The seating in the restaurant was cramped so we opted for the covered patio which is nice, but right on the street.  Parking is a little bit of a challenge."}
{"text":"I'd give my first (and likely only) experience at Cabo Fish taco 2.5 stars. I want to give it more based on the location, vibe, and service, but the food simply isn't very good.  First off, the chips, salsa, and queso. The chips were stale, the corn salsa was nothing more than underripe tomato chunks and corn (no seasoning whatsoever), and the queso was quite clearly microwaved velveeta. Not a good start.   For entrees, we split the specialty tuna and bbq mahi tacos. Both were one-note and heavy-handed on the sauces. Requested tuna medium rare, but received overcooked tuna. Way too much wasabi on the tuna--not too spicy, it just overpowered every other flavor. Bbq sauce was incredibly sweet and drowned out the flavor of fresh, well prepared mahi. Rice and beans on the side were flavorless.   Maybe this is what constitutes a good restaurant in Charlotte. I certainly hope not."}
{"text":"Food is good. Drinks are good. Expanded restaurant means that the waits are much shorter than they used to be. Seems cliche but the fish tacos are the way to go here. House margaritas are delicious and inexpensive (they also have an El Cheapo Marg that I think is only $3), but the house is way better and still a bargain at $5. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Man what a let down! I was so amped to get to this place after I saw it on Diners Drive-ins and Dives. Flavorless beer battered fish taco, chips and salsa with no pizzazz, even the beans and rice were blah. And my server had some kind of narly rash on his elbows, yuck. It's not an experience that I ever care to have again."}
{"text":"The grilled salmon taco is a must have! I really enjoy the Mahi-Mahi Tacos and the Lemon-Grilled Shrimp tacos. (My wife and I have been here a few times.) If you're new to Charlotte (... or not) I definitely recommend Cabo."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a bite to eat before a show at the Neighborhood Theater. I'm from out of town and was really hungry so went for the tofu tacos. All in all, very good taco but I would've preferred smaller pieces of tofu if it's going to be on a taco. Cool vibes, dope art work, and love the outdoor seating. Very cool area too. Props to Noda!"}
{"text":"Quite a foodie and boy did we love this place!  Great food and service! The salsa and queso were fantastic and we followed the recommendation of our server for the BBQ Tacos and Blacked Mahi Mahi - amazing!!"}
{"text":"One of the best for Mexican cuisine in Charlotte. Have eaten here on multiple locations and satisfied every time.  Chips and salsa are packed full of flavor as well as any other menu item. I haven't tried anything I thought was less than 4 stars. The shark tacos are seasonal so get then while you can!  The staff is helpful and friendly so if you need some help picking something from the menu just ask. Out of all the NODA area restaurants, I will say this is one of the best."}
{"text":"We put in our name and waited 25 minutes, while groups of various sizes, who came in after us--were seated ahead of us. When I checked back with the hostess and pointed to an empty table near her she said, \"I'm sorry. I can't seat you there. It's a fire hazaard.\" Then proceeded to seat another party there. We finally left. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the battered shrimp and grilled shimp taco. There wasn't much flavor. It was disappointing but my husband loved his tacos (swordfish and mahi). Service was fine. Chips and salsa eh. I'd rather go to Saber Latin Street for a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"It was a lot easier to get a seat, grab a taco and leave back when Cabo was a place where mainly those of an artistic bent hung out.  Suddenly Fat City was torn down, more restaurants moved in and NoDa became an acceptable place for the crowd that never left Uptown before that point.  Enter hour-long waits to get food and a slight decline in the quality of the food.  But we all must move forward....  Cabo has finally torn down the wall and expanded their restaurant!  Hopefully this will continue to alleviate the wait time and it won't be such a pain in the ass to eat here.  I'm a big fan of the corn salsa and nepalitos salad.  I typically stick with the blackened mahi tacos since the fish on their taco specials is not really as exciting as it used to be.  Service is often quite good, but there are days where it can be piss poor, too.  Overall I'm happy with service, though.    I don't go to Cabo because they make the best tacos I've ever had or because they have an extensive beer menu.  I go to Cabo to eat an above average taco, drink some cheap Mexican beer (probably from a can AND with an unnecessary piece of citrus fruit) and enjoy a sunny day outside while sitting inside.  I also like to stare at Will Puckett's art and wish that I actually had the talent to paint."}
{"text":"Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times.  I usually order the same thing, last time I branched out and tried a chicken and shrimp burrito.  It was ok but the real winner for me here is the mahi tacos, they're great!  It's disappointing though when you place a to go order and get no chips and salsa.  Thought that was a fluke the first time but they don't give them for to go orders.  Tacos are so good though it doesn't matter too much."}
{"text":"BBQ mahi mahi tacos, are life! The salsa is amazing and pretty much everything i have tried, is great!"}
{"text":"Heard rave reviews about this place so when in the area with two friends who were familiar, we decided to eat there.  \"Meh\" is a good description.  Expensive for what you get.  Slow.  And simply nothing special about the food.  They enjoyed their lunches but I think I could have given them peanut butter and jelly on rye and they'd have enjoyed it just as much.  There's plenty better out there."}
{"text":"Great food and portions! BUT be prepared to wait for a table if you come too late. Worth it for anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Really sub par.  This must do good business b/c of the diners drive... show.  I had their basic fish taco.  Cabbage not crunchy, cut too small, breading on fish not crunchy, fish fishy, no lime, sides boring, flour tortilla yuck.  Margaritas were good, as was service."}
{"text":"When I was 18 years old, they served me alcohol without carding me and the bartender was very friendly. I suppose this wasn't very responsible of them, but I did have a nice time there regardless."}
{"text":"Not impressed the food was over seasoned and even the patio was loud.Should cactus salad have cactus? Mine didn't.  I have to lean towards Bill M's response. I think the name and location makes this a so called \"hip\"place to go. I just prefer to taste my food not have it covered up with \"a hint of lime\"which must have been a whole lime. Not real anxious to go back but who knows."}
{"text":"I love this place - it was one of my early finds upon moving to Charlotte a few years ago, and I go back about once a month.   I almost always get either the Mahi Mahi tacos or the Chicken serrano tacos -- in the tortilla on a bed of cabbage, with CBT's signature yogurt-based sauce, and some queso fresco...yum. My husband always gets the Cabo Fish Tacos, but I prefer my fish unfried. I got a burrito once - nothing to rave about - and the scallops once - tasty - but I'm kind of blown away by the reviews on here who give CBT a one or two-star rating and then confess \"well, I don't like seafood/fish/the central concept\" etc. Why would you go to a place with the word \"fish\" in the name? But anyway....  The corn salsa DOES always end up on the table. Just wipe it up. The real disappointment for me, taste-wise, is the sides. I've had the cucumber salad, the napolitos salad, and th baja rice...all not good at all. My husband always gets the Mexican coleslaw, but I stick to beans/rice (with corn)...definitely the tastiest, in my opinion.  And spending $8 for dinner - excellent. Add in a margarita (starting at $4 for the \"El Cheapo\") and you're all set."}
{"text":"First let me say that I just moved here from New Orleans. I live to eat and know good food when I taste it.  With all due respect, I have no idea how this restaurant got so many 4-5 star reviews. The service is great and fast, but that's all I can say on a positive note.  The fish tacos were on the fishy side - even with all of the heavy seasoning and salt, you can't be fooled. Nothing that we got here was fresh. The \"queso\" was straight up Velveeta with some peppers (probably Rotel, if I had to guess). The \"Mexican slaw\" was the blandest of cole slaw with some pumpkin seeds sprinkled on top. Neither the salsa nor the pico de gallo was fresh - you know this Bc it was cold - straight out of the fridge. Any salsa you get at a legit Mexican restaurant, or just any restaurant in general, are served room temp. In either case, it was bland as hell.  Save your time and money and head next door to Sabor. Everything is fresh and authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"Love the tacos and customer service! Chips are stale :/ for some reason every time I've gone, someone has over cooked the chips or they taste like they've been sitting out for a day."}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco is super tasty... I've been there twice but this is my first review and both times was great! The downside.... if you're super hungry, go early or be prepared to wait. I've been to NoDa several times and this place is always crowded.... I'm talking 45 min wait or so.... But it's no big deal because they tell you your table is ready via text so we just went across the street to get a drink and an appetizer and problem solved. I wish they did take a few reservations for big parties.  Their food is very very good. The fish tacos are the signature dish and the best part is that you can mix and match the fillings. There's a ton of sides I've had the nopalito salad, the beans, the avocado salad and they are all very good. The beer battered shrimp/fish were my favorite.  I also had a burrito on my other visit and it was also very good. We had queso and some sort of crab dip as an appetizer and they were both good. Their salsa has corn and its super yummy.   The service was good too.... prices are very reasonable and you get giant servings of food so can't complain."}
{"text":"I live in Noda so sometimes I come here out of convenience but I'm never greatly satisfied. Their tacos are good, but for the price you can get way better.  Their chips are always stale too.  Although the food is not anything special their service has always been good."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Great tacos. Ive never had fish tacos before this place and I was surprised how much I love them!"}
{"text":"Carne asata wrap and a small pasta salad waiter was awesome and the food rocked!!!! Def would come back!!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but very bad quality of food.. price is ok but I guess you can't ask for more when it has a poor flavor. I would comeback for the atmosphere but not so much for the food"}
{"text":"I've never been to Cabo, and I don't like fish tacos. I also don't like paying to park in dodgy gravel lots. However, I do like parking for free about a block down from NoDa's Cabo Fish Taco. There I might see a man in the yard adjacent to my meterless spot, expertly swinging chains with fiery balls attached to the ends. That he was performing for the group of firemen encircling him made it seem somehow normal.  You just never know what you are going to get in NoDa. You do, however, know what you are going to get at Cabo Fish Taco.  Usually, you'll get a waiting list. They've expanded into the space next door, where the hardwood planks are far less buoyant than those on the original side, and added covered outdoor seating. Their popularity has grown as well, so the extra room is proportionate to the demand. They don't take reservations, and at lunch and  even on weeknights there's sometimes a short wait, so it's best to plan accordingly.  You'll always get complimentary salsa. Not the liquefied tomato version of most Tex-Mex eateries, but Cabo Fish Taco's primarily corn, tomato and black bean brand that always has a few rebellious members who refuse to stay in the bowl or on a chip.  Fresh food is de rigueur at Cabo Fish Taco, along with special twists of white cilantro sauce and Napolito Salad. That's cactus, to the gringos. For those of us who don't care for fish, the menu also includes salads, burritos, tacos, quesadillas and my favorite, the Serrano Chicken Salad with a side of Mexi-Slaw, all sans fins.  Perhaps as a nod to the weird, or to the sense of community in NoDa, there are two toilets in the ladies room, but no stalls. I'd bet cash money that women with no previous interactions except simultaneously full bladders have used those potties in tandem based on their consumption of Purple Haze Margaritas.  Casual, and generally quick service is expected at Cabo Fish Taco, where the vibe is decidedly NoDa and what I expect of Cabo San Lucas: Anything goes, as long as it is good."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! The cabo rolls are at the top of my \"must have\" list, followed by Tavarua Tuna tacos"}
{"text":"Had the fish and chicken burrito at lunch.  Great taste.  The chips and corn salsa was a welcome change vs regular tomato based salsa."}
{"text":"Never thought I would ever say this....but I have found fish tacos as good as the ones I grew up with in California. Cabo is a fun and cool hangout in an already cool and eclectic NoDa neighborhood. 4 stars because my wife was not a fan of their margaritas, but if you are in downtown Charlotte pop over to this place, it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"After being repeat customers we had the worst experience with customer service. Since that time we have not been back and will not return."}
{"text":"Okay-tacos are delicious and the staff are super friendly...I didn't care for the ambience since it was a bit loud to carry on any conversation and one ladies bathroom for a packed place is ridiculous.....  Frankly, the tacos are the BEST so it doesn't matter if there are no available bathroom, loud music, long wait.. It is worth it :-)"}
{"text":"I guess they're the best place in Charlotte called \"Cabo Fish Taco.\"  Try the 15 dollar tuna and rice burrito that hits your stomach like a wad of clay.  Or any of the fish tacos which leave you parched and wondering \"do they understand the importance of vegetation to compliment fish, rice, and beans?\" The food gets a c- but the atmosphere gets an a-. Don't take my word for it though, Ive only lived in 5 major cities."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  I had heard good things about it before going, and thought from the name that it would be really fresh and authentic.  I couldn't be more wrong.  You get chips and salsa to start - but its not even salsa.  Its a bowl that looks like they threw a handful of canned corn in the bottom, chopped some tomatoes and onions on top and then added in some picked cactus.  It was vinegary and just bad.  I asked if they had some other salsa, and they brought me a ketchup flavored bowl of yuck.... On to the main course... I ordered the beer battered shrimp tacos, thinking the seafood tacos would be their star dish.  The tortillas were fried, the shrimp had no flavor, and it just tasted greasy and bland.  This place probably stays in business because it is one of the onyl restaurants on the block.  Save yourself the money!"}
{"text":"Don't agree with all of the hype Great atmosphere and location. But the food is just bland sadly. Still the concept is great and its a appreciated part of Charlotte thus 3 stars."}
{"text":"One of the best and most unique places in Charlotte. I love the honey wasabi tuna tacos. Packed with flavor and always a lively place to hang out. I have never been disappointed in what I ordered. The corn salsa is also really good."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with any of their burritos or tacos. Corn salsa is delish. Margaritas are refreshing. Jalapeno mashers are my favorite side item! Only complaint, sometimes the tuna could be prepared more med rare."}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco in the NoDa section of Charlotte is an enjoyable place to eat.  Not only is it close to New Life Theological Seminary where I work, but they consistently have great food and great service.  I could make a meal off of the salsa and chips; it is fantastic.   My personal favorite is the Southwest Chicken Wrap, I rank it the best in Charlotte!  This time of the year you can choose a fresh summer fruit cup as a side, an added bonus.  The restaurant is always busy and can sometimes be a little noisy, not the place to hold a business luncheon and parking is limited."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with some team members today, after seeing the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives episode.  It is in the art district of North Charlotte, also called No Da for North Davidson.  The seating area was pretty large and we did not have to wait to be seated.  The service was good as well.  They brought out some chips with a corn-based salsa which was pretty good, with a slight bite to it but the chips were pretty sad, like they had been laying around for a while...definitely not crisp.  We all ordered the fish tacos, with several of us choosing the blackened Mahi Mahi. Our plates arrived within about 15 minutes, which did not seem too long and the tacos were really good.  I had a side of jalapeno mashed potatoes and they were not very warm but they tasted good.  Overall, we all thought the lunch experience was great and the tacos were great also.  We will be returning to Cabo Fish Taco again for sure."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great comments about Cabo so I had to try it. There was no wait on a Wednesday night (compared to the long waits I've heard about on the weekends). Our chips were a little stale, but I was excited to try their famous tacos.  I had one carne asada taco and a tofu taco. I liked the carne asada mix better, but I wouldn't say there was anything special about these specialty tacos. Tasty nonetheless. I'm glad I was able to try Cabo and I didn't wait 2+ hours for our food on a busy night."}
{"text":"Corn and Shrimp chowder excellent taste, could have been a few degrees warmer. Shrimp and crab dip came with fried pita. Why fry pita? Waitress exchanged for fresh pita. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was sooo excited to try this place after hearing all of the hype! Not what I thought it was going to be... Food is alright, nothing to write home about. I had the fried whitefish taco which was decent, but I've had much better. The margs were off though... Didn't even taste like a margarita to be honest and nobody at my table even finished half of theirs. I think there are much better Mexican places in the area."}
{"text":"Great food but service was lacking.  I went with a group of friends months ago.  I asked for my food not spicy at all and a friend asked for it very spicy.  When it came out, they had got it mixed up.  Mine was extremely spicy and his was not spicy at all. No big deal, just send it back and have it remade.  It came out the second time, and same thing, the food was the same.  Mine was still extremely spicy and his had no spiciness at all.  We complained to the waitress again.  My friend and I decided to switch food so I had his and he had mine.  The bill came and they charged us for both.    While the food was amazing, the service was lacking."}
{"text":"First off, be prepared to wait.  If you go on a weekend night, you will definitely wait, most likely at least an hour depending on what time you get there.  But even though some previous reviewers might disagree with me, I thought that service was reasonably fast once we were inside.    Food was average.  As a vegetarian, I can't have their signature item, so no tacos pour moi, but I still judge places on their veg items.  And what I had wasn't bad at all, it was sort of a grilled California burrito with queso (Burrito Verde).  It was big and I took home a good bit of it.  Had a side of Jalapeno and Cheese Mashers, which was fairly bland.  But prices were fine.  Small but decent selection of beers on tap (Dogfish, etc. when I was there).  Overall, I would probably give this place a 2.5.  Though the food isn't great, they don't forget about the vegetarian.  And the wait should be expected.  But its just so LOUD!!!  Have to deduct some points for that.  If I wait, and deal with noise, and then the food is amazing, then its worth the trouble.  But though good, the food here just doesn't justify dealing with waiting/atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place in Charlotte. The shrimp and fish tacos are awesome. Additionally, the pasta was well done for a restaurant specializing in tacos. Whenever we have visitors from out of town, we take them here."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are brilliant! My wife and I went here for exactly that and have Zero complaints. The dish in the tacos is cut into large chucks and cooked perfectly, something uncommon for fish tacos elsewhere.  The tortillas are lightly fried but with no greasiness, only crisp and fluffy.  Ambience was good, nothing special there. Beer list consisted of national staples and some local fav's.  I even took my father-in-law here who is a fish taco connoisseur from CA and he said they beer better that any fish taco he's had in CA, including Rubio's."}
{"text":"oh my gawd, this place is amazeballs!!! Service is fantastic, food is phenomenal, great drink selections!!! Visited on a Friday night with a large party and we were well taken care of.  We mingled for a bit on the bar area before being seated where I had the fried shrimp app ans an overflowing shrimp taco with pasta salad.  I wish I had more room for everything else on the menu!   The décor was fun with sugar skull chicks, paintings, signs, wood floors, etc.  Music was  loud-ish but not so bar-like that you're going deaf yelling in someone's ears.  Plenty of bathrooms, although I was a bit thrown off looking for them as they're up against the wall in the bar area, but there's more at the back on the dining room as well.  There's also patio dining."}
{"text":"My first time here tonight. I'd heard the food was good but wanted to be the judge myself. My main dish was the BBQ Mahi and it didn't disappoint. The combination of the BBQ sauce and spices kept my taste buds working throughout the meal. Refried beans had adequate texture to compliment the Mahi. Service was prompt and attentive to my needs. The Buckshot local draft beer helped top off the meal. I will return to this establishment to get deeper into Cabo's menu."}
{"text":"I am a professional cook myself so i tend to be critical about quality, service and presentation. With that being said my dining experience last night was a treat. As soon as my eyes were presented with my dish(BBQ Mahi Tacos w/ Spicy Avacado pasta), i couldn't wait to indulge. My dish was fresh and full of flavor, plated simple but nice. The atmosphere was relaxed and pleasant. My girlfriend's Beer Battered Salmon dish left much to be desired. Personally salmon is not a fish that muddle up with deep frying. The flavor was truly lacking. Rachel was our server and definitely contributed to our pleasant dining experience. I would highly recommend this very reasonably priced restaurant to a friend."}
{"text":"Cabo is always on my mind whenever I crave a fish taco or one of their huge burritos.  Service is about as good as you should expect from a pretty popular locale and the beer selection is fantastic.  If the weather is good, try to get a patio table and people watch!"}
{"text":"Love this place ... usually a wait but there's always room at the bar. I recommend the BBQ Mahi Taco's"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Charlotte. You can't beat the blackened mahi tacos."}
{"text":"Awesome experience.  Sat outside, lots of drinks to choose from, delicious fish tacos!  Also, we had one of the dips for an appetizer and it was served with warm chips."}
{"text":"Wasabi ahi tuna BBQ mahi  Both were outstanding. My boss got the carne ones and those were better than the salmon ones.  Highly recommend. 2nd time there Nd definitely not the last."}
{"text":"There is always an hour + wait but its delicious. Don't order the tuna taco unless you're a big fan of wasabi (cream sauce served over top). I recommend putting your name on the list and going across the street for a beer at Growlers."}
{"text":"Was just down here on vacation, and I will be going back next time I am in Charlotte. This place is just simply amazing for food. I had some shrimp tacos that I loved. The app I had was average, and the beer selection was average as well. The waitress was just above average. If they just improve a few things, this is a 5 star place, but the food enough is reason to come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time because it was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives television show. It is now my favorite restaurant in Charlotte and the best fish taco I've eaten. Every time I have guests visit Charlotte, this is a place that I take them to. Every time. Each time I've gone here (4 or 5 times) has been a great experience.   The vibe and the ambience is upbeat and laid back. The lighting is fine, and it gives off a casual dining atmosphere. The service is extremely quick, and the waiters have been attentive and friendly every time. They start you off with free chips and corn/tomato salsa which is very tasty. Not to mention it's free!   I've only ever eaten the fish tacos here and I can't imagine myself ordering anything else. They let you mix and match two tacos with each other, so you can try two different ones. The portions are pretty big and they don't hold back when it comes to the fish. Not a big fish taco eater prior to coming here, I always assumed I would be hungry after eating fish tacos. Not here - I am stuffed every time. The two fish tacos come with a side dish ranging from rice and beans to jalapeno mashed potatoes. One sneaky good side I would recommend is the avocado pasta salad though! Would recommend the BBQ mahi mahi tacos (the ones Guy Fieri had on his show) and the Tavarua tuna tacos (if you're not a big wasabi fan, get the sauce on the side, cause it's strong).  They don't do reservations so expect a wait at peak hours, but it will be worth it.  Bottom line: Amazing food, great atmosphere, efficient and attentive service. What gives this 5 stars and not 4 is the affordability - Prices are extremely fair and you get a lot of good food for what you pay. If you're in Charlotte you must eat here."}
{"text":"Eat here at least once per month for lunch. Love the fresh salsa served with the drinks. Always order special fish taco of the day. Today was SeaBass with a mango salsa. Great as always."}
{"text":"You will probably have the best taco of your life right here at Cabo fish taco. And holy cow, the corn salsa?! I cried when we left our take-home order of salsa on the table once. Everything I've tried here was superb. Go for the upcharge and order the queso. It's worth it. Trust me."}
{"text":"Excellent experience! We took a 5 or 6 mile detour off the highway after researching good places from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives between Atlanta and Washington, DC (long car trip!) to stop at Cabo. It was one of the best meals of the trip!  I really like that you can mix and match tacos on your plate - you aren't committed to two of the same tacos, you can swap from one of the specials or any of the others featured on the menu. I got the BBQ Mahi, the sheepshead (fish) special, and the cactus side salad. The BBQ Mahi was DELICIOUS - I can't say enough good things! The sheepshead (which I've never had before - mild flavor) would be good any other day of the week, but it was hard to compare after the BBQ Mahi. My boyfriend got the avocado pasta salad, and I'd recommend that over the cactus salad (the salad wasn't bad, just a lot of beans to it - fresh flavor though).  If you're in the area or passing through on the highway, I would definitely recommend this stop. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"So yummy! We love eating at Cabo fish taco. The service was amazing. I had the pomegranate margarita which was perfect and not too sweet. I also had the rasta pasta which is so tasty! It's sweet, with a little spice. Overall everything was wonderful and we will be back again."}
{"text":"The waiter was entertaining and very helpful with explaining the menu to my date. The food came out quickly and tasted great."}
{"text":"Even though it was very busy the service was great and the food was fantastic. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm ashamed that it's taken me so long to write a review about one of my favorite places in Charlotte. Anyone who has not tried Cabo, is definitely missing out. The service here is by far the best i've experienced and i've dined in many places, in different parts of the world. Very attentive, very professional staff but not stuffy or uptight and quite fun, I always leave happy and full. Many of my friends are now addicted to this place and I must say I am the cause for this addiction. Anyone who has yet to try this place, I have to recomend the Cabo Roll and/or the Honey Wasabi Wahoo Burrito. Both are heavenly!"}
{"text":"We really wanted this place to be better. We saw it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and thought we would give it a try. We loved their house special of fried white fish taco - it was delicious but needed a little more sauce. The house-made cole slaw was dry and cabbage pieces cut too large. The tuna tacos were good but the tuna was overcooked. The queso had a nice consistency and flavor.  The service was fine but nothing really stood out. It is a great casual affordable option in NoDa with good margaritas."}
{"text":"I have rode by this place many times in NODA and I finally got the opportunity to eat here on Thursday for lunch. Me and my sister had a FAB time!  The corn salsa and chips they bring out while you wait for your food are great. I had the Lemon Grilled Tuna Tacos with Baja Rice. The tacos were filling and the rice was cooked well. The sauce that goes on top of the rice was really sweet as well. My sister got the Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos with black beans and rice. I'm not a fan of black beans, but I got myself a little bite of my sister's shrimp tacos and they were good.   I believe the next time we go, I'm definitely going to try the Beer Battered Shrimp Tacos! This is one place I will return to again and again."}
{"text":"My friends and I arrived at 6:00pm on a Friday and the place was nearly filled, but luckily we were seated after arrival. The waitstaff checked up on the table frequently and brought more chips and corn salsa once we were out. Chips were salted and the ingredients in the corn salsa were fresh, however,  the salsa was spiceless. We ordered guacamole for the table and it was good, also not spicy. I expected my tuna burrito to be pretty bland judging from the corn salsa and the guacamole, but the cilantro sauce added the spiciness I was after. The tuna was delicious! I also had the Cheapo margarita and that was very smooth."}
{"text":"Terrible margaritas! We paid $11 for watery, salty drinks. Totally not worth the money. The food and service were excellent. Will definitely come back, but will order a beer next time."}
{"text":"Cabo fish taco has pretty good food, with a fairly unique and satisfying menu. A decent selection of drinks that aren't going to blow you out of the water (price wise) and are clearly segmented into tequila qualities etc.  But really, truly, and honestly, the noise level at this place is OUT OF CONTROL. There's no other way to put it. You can be at a 2 person table and not hear a single word your date it saying. I can't even imagine what  a 6 person table is like.  Service was fast and very friendly. I have no idea how our server even heard me over the roaring but our orders came out fresh and correct.  The food's a 4, maybe a 4.25, but the experience is a 2 at best. I don't go to a restaurant to sit in silence because conversation is totally futile. The place seems popular enough but how people get past the maximum volume jimmy buffet + atrocious acoustics I will never understand."}
{"text":"I lived in Charlotte for three years and, unfortunately, I did not discover this restaurant until 6 months before I moved away. Oh what a pity! This is in my top 5 of restaurants in the country, which includes top restaurants in Vegas and NYC. I am planning a trip to Charlotte this summer just so I can eat here. The lemon grilled shrimp tacos are amazing. The green tomatillo salsa. The shrimp and crab dip. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Looooooooove Cabo! I wish they delivered food mail order!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this fun, local restaurant! Cabo is always the #1 place that our family takes out of town friends and family! The servers are friendly , knowledgeable, and quick taking our order, and the food is served hot and delicious. The chipotle corn salsa and the chipotle cheese dip are delicious starters! For a decadent starter, I highly recommend the seafood dish! My favorite dish is 1 mahi mahi taco and 1 shrimp taco with the avocado pasta salad side dish. With a squeeze of fresh lime, the perfect chewiness of the floor tortillas, and the bright flavors of the fish and shrimp--YUM! I could go there right now! :)"}
{"text":"Had an early dinner there last week and received excellent food (White fish taco, black beans, and rice) and great service. Sat at the bar, watched TV, drank a beer, talked with the bartender, and savored every bite. It's hard to beat Cabo for the food (delicious every time) and atmosphere (casual and very eclectic).   Can't go wrong with Cabo! (But come early to find parking in NoDa - only negative aspect to the whole deal)."}
{"text":"The building is not nearly as large as I would have imagined. Cabo Fish Taco is in an old historic circa 1900 building (cool character for sure) but due to its size (amongst other things) I could easily see where all the bad reviews came from. I would not come here on a Saturday night. Never.  The bar itself seats probably 10 people. The NoDa area has a plague of tiny sized bars, any semi busy time is going to be tricky to get a stool anywhere.  There was quite a bit of staff and their friends (both on and off duty) pretty much just loitering, making it take literally 8 minutes for two maragritas (delicious and alcoholic though) at a bar with only two paying customers. Although, the service here isn't much different than service in any other North Carolina establishment-- its going to be slow.  I do wish they had mojitos or more of a menu variety. Its pretty much just fish tacos and margaritas. I get its their \"deal\" but there was maybe three creative things on the menu (like the tacos are basic, I expected more pizzazz and creativity being featured on 'Triple D' and all). The chips were fresh and par for a chip, guessing the \"soggy chip\" reviews probably come from humid months since fresh chips are stored by the bar in a hotel pan without a lid. A tip for CFT: store your chips in a plastic bin with a cover.   The salsa looked like shoepeg canned corn with some jazz and was NOT the least bit zippy. Kids would like it though, pretty flavorless. The guacamole was ok, Chipotles is better. I don't think its actually from a bucket, but it was processed to death in the kitchen. Another tip: add salt and lime to the guac. Its seriously lacks flavor.   Other little peeves included a hair (totally impossibly mine) deep in my guacamole and pieces of crab shell in my crab roll (which was good, minus the extra crunch). Also, the bartender being way too interested in his girlfriend loitering at the bar to refill our drinks multiple times brought down my rating.   SUMMARY: check it out on a Tuesday afternoon, its not worth fighting Saturday night crowds for. Plan way ahead to order drinks from the bar (even if its empty) and be patient. This place operates on its own schedule. But, its a cool little spot to check out, good margaritas, and fits in well with the NoDa artsy vibe. Now I just wish someone would get creative with that menu, lots of potential. And triple the size of the bar. And make the employees go home after their shifts instead of hanging out with the on-duty workers not buying anything."}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday, because Taco Tuesday, right?  I ordered the Grilled Salmon tacos from the menu.....one was more than enough to stuff me, and I had the second for lunch the next day.  The tacos were $5 each on Tuesdays....great meal, and great service!"}
{"text":"I love the food here its good not to mention very unique. Located in the NODA area so its funky artsy and really chill. I would recommend anything on the menu its worth a try ."}
{"text":"Great service!  Beer selection good.  Lemon Grass Shrimp are tasty, not overpowering.  Chips and salsa were not awesome so that's why I only gave 4 stars."}
{"text":"Moving from Phoenix I can be a bit of a taco snob.  Although its not \"real\" Mexican food its really tasty. I like the lemon shrimp tacos the best. The corn salsa is refreshing and I'll add this place on my list of regulars for sure.   The only thing that puzzles me is why there is California Reggae Dub music playing in the background.  Its more like Mexico meets Texas on a tourist Jamaican vacation.  I'm a huge fan of tacos and Reggae/Dancehall but I've never seen them meet this way.  It's interesting.  I'll keep coming as long as the shrimp tacos stay on the menu."}
{"text":"Yes, another four star review from me.  But the place was great. Excellent service, good food and nice selection of microbrews to match.  I ordered the salmon tacos. Fish was in chunks, lightly seasoned with cabbage, cheese, guacamole and queso sauce. Tortilla was chewy, but still good and didn't \"dissolve\" after one bite.  Also ordered the guacamole and chips. Homemade and very good, but a little too purée for me as well and would have liked a little more cilantro, but still good. Hard to screw up guacamole.  Ordered a couple of local beers and enjoyed each. Sat at the bar and again, find the best service at the bar.  Small place and packed on a Thursday night. Cool place to check out a \"local\" Charlotte hangout."}
{"text":"I will start with the \"good\". We had an amazing server and our cocktails were good. I took some family here that are visiting and the food was not good. Our chips were stale, the corn salsa wasn't good. We ordered a side of guacamole and we got something out of a package with some chopped onion thrown on top and no flavor. The food was overpriced and horrible"}
{"text":"Interesting menu. Tacos were fun (white fish, shrimp, and BBQ maki), and one taco a-la-carte with a drink would make a good, cheap meal.  The tortilla chips were mediocre and fried taco shell was not my style, so minus 2 stars.  Water Snob says: thumbs down for icky tap water. Will order a beer next time and try something other than a taco."}
{"text":"Super Awesome place for food!!!!!! The different fish tacos varieties make love to my taste buds!!!!"}
{"text":"You should have two types of chips,  one with salt, and one without .  High blood pressure is a major issue and salt, is the major demon. Give people the option.  I'm a regular customer and love your food but it really pisses me off when you bring me a of  bucket full of salted chips. Next time I come there I have been promised  by a shift manager to cook a basket of salt free chips. Thank you. Dont be like Bojangles salt infused!!!!! Their's salt on the table!!!!!!!!!  We love the tofu here. We're vegetarians. They are a few choices you offer. Thank you!!!!!  But this salt that the cook puts on these chips after they come out of the grease is under unnecessary!! Enough is enough!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   You would have 5 stars with out this issue....."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place but I really think it's overrated. I've been a number of times over the years and the food is rarely better than ok. The service has always been awesome though."}
{"text":"Lunch stop with a large group. No problems with getting in or with our service. Food was excellent and hot when served. Blackened Mahi Mahi and Salmon were phenomenal. The only thing I didn't like was the jalapeños in the guacamole. No worries though, they gladly brought out another fish without so it was perfect. Definitely a go to spot for lunch. Deron (Bartender/server) was attentive and on the money!"}
{"text":"Lunch date with my hubby .   This is our first time here. I had the lemon grilled shrimp tacos and my husband had the chicken fajitas.   I could not taste the LEMON GRILLED\" flavor and the chicken fajitas seemed to have a Teriyaki sauce flavor.    The chips are thicker than I like...we ordered a white cheese queso and a red salsa.  The queso tasted more like the yellow cheese dip to us.   The red salsa was very good.    Overall, we found it to be a very friendly, chipper, quick turn around restaurant and will order something differently on or next visit."}
{"text":"We have had mixed reviews about Cabo but it has just gone downhill recently. Took a special friend there last night and liteally had to wave our hostess down every time we needed something. The cabo roll was good but my whitefish tacos were COLD! I mean like cold tortilla, cold slaw, cold fish that had been sitting out. Did not complain because they did not seem to give a rats ass!"}
{"text":"I suppose it depends on what you come here for. I enjoy coming here for an alternative to mexican for something a bit more healthy. i like the grilled mahi mahi with a side of fresh fruit. If I'm going to really eat mexican out I would not come here as the fish tacos are a bit on the bland side. Nothing is really spicy."}
{"text":"the best part of this meal was the salsa and chips.  Service sucked we waited a good ten minutes before anyone came to our table after being seated, and it wasn't busy. Guacamole was missing something just didn't taste like guac- it was missing something, but not sure what.  My salad was not very good, The veggies were cut to thick, and obviously cut way earlier in the day as they were starting to wilt. Any of the seeds that the wrote about on the menu were obviously plated first as they weren't seen until the end. Chicken was suppose to be spicy- it was bland although cooked decently.  The fish taco that my wife had was disappointing and lack luster.  It was very uninspired, the blackened mahi mahi was well not blacked the cheese was just kinda there the only redeeming part of it was a white cilantro sauce.   Overall food would be a 2 but service is a 1.  that combo wont be bring me back."}
{"text":"People must like fishy fish tacos, because this place gets great reviews and a cool hangout, but every time I order fish tacos, they are very fishy. The plates and utensils are usually dirty, maybe is it part of NoDa style. I didn't enjoy myself. Sorry."}
{"text":"We went after hearing great things about this place, but was disappointed by the blandness of the food. The shrimp & crab dip appetizer was very good, but the taco's and burritos were bland. Save the trip."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS MAYBE EVER??? Arrived on a Saturday night around 6 and told there would be a 30-45 minute wait (ended up being 20) and wandered around the cute neighborhood. The wait is 100% worth it. We ordered the guacamole salmon salad to share and it was very yummy. But the highlight of the night was by far the tacos. We ordered the Tavarua tuna tacos and the honey glazed salmon tacos. The tortillas were perfectly soft and every bite was full of flavor. Highly highly highly recommend coming here for the tacos!!! Definitely the best tacos I've ever had. We devoured the tacos and would have come back if we weren't leaving the next morning. If you are in the area definitely come here!!! The waitstaff is super friendly and helpful and the ambiance is so fun."}
{"text":"I don't live in town and we really struggle to find good restaurants. We were on our way back to suburbia and the wife and I decided to head into Noda to see if we could get a decent meal.   It was so nice to go to a relaxed place with good food. I live in a town where Beef Obrady's and McAlester's deli is cherished. I hate these places so if you are a fan of those restaurants, ignore my review. Every kids menu is filled with crap I wouldn't feed my dog much less my kids.   Our kids ordered their grilled shrimp and fruit. They ate every bit of it. I had the signature bbq fish taco and thought it was wonderful. The chocolate cake is a yes."}
{"text":"My family and I just went to Cabo Fish Taco two nights ago and I'm STILL thinking about it. I had the BBQ Mahi Taco and the Tavarua Wahoo Taco and it was absolutely delicious!!! The flavors burst in your mouth from beginning to end. I can honestly say they were the most flavorful tacos I've ever had...Now that's saying a lot.   On the other hand my wife and daughter had the shrimp and chicken bowl and although they were very tasty, the shrimp were on a skewer and there might have been 4 or 5 in total. I'm only saying this because the pictures seemed to be FULL of shrimp, where in actuality it was all the vegetables and rice surrounding them.  The chicken however was plentiful."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ Mahi Mahi fish tacos.  Told my friend it was like the tacos were having sex in my mouth it was so good.  Great spin on ready a solid staple fish taco!  *definitely on the low end of $11-$20.  My whole bill for one was $12.  Definitely worth the $12!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot on the weekdays. The weekends can get a little hectic with long waits. The lemon grilled shrimp tacos are my favorite entree!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great venue and great experience. Try the Wasabi Tuna!!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco joint in Charlotte.  Great beer, great atmosphere, and amazing food.  I have not had anything from Cabo that has not been spectacular.  I have had all of the tacos, and every single one is amazing.  My personal favorite is the carne asada.  So yummy. The jalepeno mash potatoes are amazing as well. Not to mention the corn salsa may be the best salsa I have ever had.  You are most likely going to wait for a table here, but that should be a given with it's popularity. Patience is a virtue and with Cabo, it pays off big time."}
{"text":"I didn't realize tacos could taste this good....   Nice location in the trendy Noda district... Indoor and outdoor seating...  Friendly staff.... Highly recommend this place...."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly and have been working our way through the menu. All of the shrimp and grilled tacos are excellent and the namesake Cabo Fish Taco is decent. They changed their menu around recently and the newly added carne asada taco is great--tender, juicy steak with nice chunks of jalapeno for some kick. The side dishes are inconsistent, but at their worst are pretty good. The only negative is that sometimes dishes can be a little sweet and... cinnamon-y? Especially the corn salsa and refried beans.  The service is laid-back and can occasionally be sloppy. At times, it seems like the staff can't handle big crowds, which is inexcusable for a restaurant that's consistently packed-with-waiting-list on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"A staple in NODA forever. Biz partner in town from Chicago- had to bring her here.  Margs are delicious.  Specials tonight are buffalo flounder and lemon pepper cod tacos. #phenomz"}
{"text":"I heard about Cabo Fish Taco from a friend who lives in the NoDa area. I was so excited because I absolutely love fish tacos. The first time I visited, I ordered the queso dip as an appetizer and the Cabo Fish Taco. The ingredients were fresh and the tortilla was delicious but there was nothing spectacular about the flavor profiles. I visited a second time and ordered the same dish to give it another shot and I was again left wanting more. The side dishes also leave something to be desired. I would be willing to visit again and try something new but definitely no time soon. It is also incredibly loud which is somewhat of a downer if you want to actually talk to your dinner companions."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and the first time was very good. We had the Mahi-Mahi Fish Tacos and we loved them. We wasn't all that impressed with the service either time with exception to the guy who seated us the second time with the dreads. He was very, very nice and helpful. The food the second time just wasn't near as good as the first. We will have to try it again some time soon."}
{"text":"Stopped here at lunch time and the food was great along with our service. The waiter was helpful when it came to describing items from the menu and we received our food in a decent time frame."}
{"text":"Disappointing. First visit was a little under a year ago. Received fresh, cooked to order, good tacos.  A week ago, I went in for a to-go order, and received it too quickly, less than 5 minutes. I knew that it wasn't fresh. Tortillas were rubbery as if they'd been microwaved. Fish batter was soggy, again, microwaved. Sad that a restaurant would start off with a bang, then skate by on reputation. It won't last at this rate, and it shouldn't."}
{"text":"Overall, a great place to hang out.  The chips were a little stale but the corn salsa had large chunks of tomato which made it extra special.  The Tavarua Wahoo Tacos were very tasty and had just the right amount of heat.  We sat on the veranda since it was a nice evening.  The service was great - constantly checking on us.  The noise level inside was on the higher side.  The Nectar of the Gods margarita went down very fast.  My only disappointment was that they don't serve any Johnny Walker!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It is always crowded so call ahead and make reservations or try to find a seat at the bar, the crab shrimp dip for an APP is great.  I always order the blackened MAHI tacos and they're always tasty, but I decided to try the beer battered shrimp tacos and HELLO... where have you been my entire life  i have been wanting this place every day since I went! Never a disappointment! And the pasta salad as a side is great! We asked them for the one with no jalapeño because it is pretty spicy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in CLT!  Not big fan of the complimentary salsa and chips (It's not a traditional salsa (has corn in it)).  My favorite dish on the menu is the Tavaruna (Tuna Tacos) the honey wasabi sauce (it is not hot) but the flavor is incredible) (one of best dishes."}
{"text":"In the words of George Takai... Ohhhhh Myyyyyy!!!  This place is freaking amazing!! I came here two nights ago before seeing Here Come The Mummies at the NEIGHBORHOOD THEATER.  I had the Tavaru Tuna tacos and thought I'd woken up on the shores of the actual Cabo!!  Tender seared marinated tuna - had to be 8 oz between the two tacos - that melted in my mouth.  I had to eat half the tuna with a freakin fork to get the them into hand food.  (I'm 6'2 230 and can palm a kickball).   Once I got my full on taco bite on - holy s$#t - the shell was like a French pastry shell flattened just to handle the all the protein deliciousness.  So in case we are not clear yet.    Stop what you are doing and sprint - not run, not walk - to this place.  And we haven't even started on the drinks. The Jalarita is their house margarita with fresh rended jalapeños and is very good.  They go from good to ARIBA ARIBA ANDELE when you get the Silver Surfer Margarita (mid shelf tequila Cointreau and fresh made house sour mix) and add the japs.  I could say more but i'm getting another drink now. So....  Adios my beloved pendejos!!  Tip: Sit at the back bar and ask for Rafaella. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Super yummy fish and shrimp tacos! We where in town from southern california and where pleasantly surprised by this gem!"}
{"text":"Cabo fish taco has consistently good food and great atmosphere.  Unique flavors and good margaritas make this a good buy.  Local area has great bars and art galleries to travel to after your meal."}
{"text":"I live in hickory nc and have friends in this area. We have been here twice now and have not ordered the same thing twice. Food is always amazen. Frash new taste and very busy. Come enjoy!"}
{"text":"for the record... cabo fish taco has never been closed due to food poisoning!!!!! you are thinking cow fish in south park!!!"}
{"text":"I feel guilty that I have never reviewed Cabo Fish Taco before because it is my favorite place! I love this place and I always take people here when they come to visit. My favorites are the BBQ mahi tacos, lemon grilled shrimp tacos and the mahi maui burrito but you really can't go wrong here. My fiance loves the rasta pasta. The guacamole is also delicious. The only thing that is sometimes a downside to this place is that it can get really loud in the restaurant which makes it hard to talk at dinner. Also, since it is so tasty, sometimes you have to wait awhile for a table. But it is SO worth it!"}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday night at about 7 so I expect to wait a little. The problem with that is, there is NO place to wait. the doorway was so crowded the hostest couldn't get to the people that had been waiting. Also people that were waiting in the bar overflowed into the tables of people eating. Once I sat down, we were in a an overflowed table. It was weird to eat with people's rears in your face.  The salsa was great. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious. I wish the chips were hot, like they are at other tex-mex restaurants. The meal I ordered was a burrito Verde (I don't eat fish). It was not really that good, the veggies didn't really go together. It tasted like they just took every veggie in the kitchen and threw it in there. I would not order this again.  The service was also not so great. I went in with three other girls and when we asked for our check to be separate we got some attitude. My water glass was empty about half the time.  Overall if I went on an off night (which from the other reviews doesn't seem like there is one and ordered something different it would be OK."}
{"text":"I love this kind of creative Mexican inspired food. They have huge portions- two tacos were plenty. Great alcohol choices and fun tacos of the day. I had a Buffalo Chicken and a Steak Chimichurri one- both way up my alley. The margarita I had was good and the vibe is nice...kinda unattractive Day of the Dead artwork, but it fits the theme. We got there right when they opened and it was nice and slow, but I bet they get hoppin' later in the day. No parking, you have to find street parking, but there is a lot right nearby."}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco is amazing.  I could inject the queso dip into my arm via IV and be content forever.  I'm so spoiled after the steak tacos that I won't order tacos anywhere else!  Best restaurant in Charlotte.  Great vibe."}
{"text":"Great food. Not impressed with the Salsa, but who cares it was free on the table. I had the shrimp taco. Excellent. My semi-picky kids loved it as well.  Great atmosphere. We got there at a perfect time. Sometimes  the line can be long. The Banana Cheese Cake was perfect.  Over all I will go back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Cabo is more like a 3.5 for me, but I'm going to give it the benefit of a doubt and round up.  I went for the first time for lunch the other day after hearing about it's awesomeness from pretty much everyone.  I enjoy the concept - fish tacos are great!  The corn salsa was mild, but different and good.  I got the tuna tacos and thought they were good but not phenomenal.  There were a lot of flavors going on and I don't think they really complemented each other.  Also, the tortilla was a little dry/crunchy.  I'd prefer a little softer, otherwise it equates in my mind as stale.  The service was good, but we did go at a less busy time.  I enjoyed the strange green people art on the walls.  I will try to avoid this place during peak hours but will go back if I'm looking for something different during lunch."}
{"text":"Stale chips, okay salsa mostly corn, fish and shrimp tacos not very hot, mashed potatoes tasted like instant with jalapeños on top."}
{"text":"Paying $5 to the sketchy dude for parking in a dark lot didn't even phase me. I'd had tacos from this place before and they were amazing.    My friend and I both ordered beers from the menu, they didn't have either.  Fine, no big deal.  We then ordered the pimento cheese rolls... SORRY,  I meant the \"CABO ROLLS\" that were filled with nothing but cheese and mayonnaise.  This set a bad tone for the rest of the experience.    I ordered the blackened Mahi tacos.   All of their signature tacos are \"finished with white cilantro sauce\" which did nothing to enhance the flavor and just made the whole thing soggy.  There was a low amount of cilantro accompanied with a low amount of flavor.    Under-seasoned and soggy are the only words to describe the tacos I had there.    I feel I am expressing very \"first world problems\" writing this review.  But for $60+ this meal sucked ass, so here is the review."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the service was great.  Getty he ta-va-rue taco you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Awesome!  The food was amazing and inexpensive.  We got sat, we're greeted instantly with chips and a yummy corn salsa by our server who took our drink and appetizer order immediately.  Of we course we had to try the queso.. Not what we were expecting, but it was really good ( we actually ended up mixing the corn salsa with the queso dip - bangin!).  We definitely miss this place now that we are living back in Maryland!"}
{"text":"After two years, I figured it was time to update my review!  My husband and I love Cabo and consistently come here about every two months or so. There is typically a wait. Though, they will take your phone number and text you when the table is ready. That way you can explore NODA some while waiting. We don't usually have any issues finding parking on the street somewhere.  We came to Cabo last week and split the BBQ Mahi Tacos with the avocado pasta salad side. The avocado pasta salad replaced the Jalapeno mashers and I gotta say, this stuff is awesome! I could just eat a plate of avocado pasta salad!! I love that when you split a meal here, they will put it on two separate plates. Totally not a big deal for them but it's just the small things that counts for me! The tacos came out and unfortunately the sauce was a bit off this time and the fish portion in the tacos was smaller than normal. Still, awesome flavors.   Over time, I have come to realize that there are some items on the menu that I think aren't as good as some of the rest. If you are coming to Cabo, I would stick with the fish tacos as they are what Cabo is known for (literally). The crab dip is spot on delicious but we rarely order it unless we have another couple with us to help eat it!  Typically there is drink specials every day and they have a very nice selection of local beers."}
{"text":"I wouldn't stray from the tacos.  This place is good but there are other cheaper alternatives (Crazy Fish) that are on par for cheaper."}
{"text":"Gotta go for the lemon grilled shrimp tacos! My all time fav, I love them so much I haven't even tried any other menu items! Great atmosphere, awesome food and drinks!"}
{"text":"In general, I like this restaurant.  Although I was extremely unhappy with the service today.  We got a LONG hair in our cheese dip appetizer and the manager just took it away like nothing happened.  They didn't give us another one or explain that they couldn't give us another one (if this was the case).  They just never mentioned it again..."}
{"text":"Best fish taco I've had outside of San Diego.  Service is fast and courteous, cheap drinks and the corn salsa is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is great, especially since they have expanded into the space next door.  No more long waits (for the most part).   I can't get enough of the basic whitefish tacos.  They are the best.  Nice serving sizes on the fish tacos as well. Service can be hit or miss but just be patient and order one of the $2 cans of Modelo w/ lime."}
{"text":"Great spot in the Noda area! The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Service and food excellence is rare and Cabo nailed it. Had the Chef special that was a twist on an excellent tasting swordfish with complementing tastes of a mango salsa and avocado amongst other toppings. Service was quick with all questions answered. All in all, one of the best places I have eaten at."}
{"text":"Great selection of food but service was horrible and slow. Food quality was average nothing appealing. I will try again and give one last chance"}
{"text":"The drinks are moderately price...which is nice, but it's pretty much down hill from there. The best thing to eat is the salsa, very fresh and heavy on the corn. I got the epic tuna burrito, it wasn't epic at all. There was no seasoning on it. Same goes for the avocado pasta salsa. No seasoning. The food could use some traditional Mexican season or even some Lawry's. Sabor Latin Street Grill is 10 times better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in NoDa! The food is amazing and the staff is super friendly and attentive. Have to try the BBQ Mahi tacos if you go! Wouldn't have been on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives if it wasn't good! Today's visit was no different. Labor Day weekend and still the best stop of my weekend!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant hands down, the BBQ Mahi tacos every time with the jalapeño mashed potatoes seasonal side! The corn salsa before your meal is so great as well! My mouth is watering just thinking about Cabo Fish Taco"}
{"text":"Happened to stumble upon this place while hanging out in the NODA District (the artsy part of town) Convinced my date to give this place a try since I was in the mood for Mexican food anyhow, was kinda busy for a Tuesday evening so I figured that must be a good sign that they get regulars to come in. We were seated, given menus and told about the drink specials which were sort of bleh so we stuck with soft drinks. They followed it up with some complimentary corn salsa & chips, thank god they don't charge for it. The taste was very bland and forgettable but still a nice gesture nonetheless. Luckily, they kept their namesake intact because there fish taco's were quite tasty, not a huge portion but certainly filling enough to get your money's worth. I went with the lemon pepper variety while my date had the more traditional version. Service was a bit sluggish, by the time we finished  our meal I had to flag down our waitress to get our check and get out of there. Certainly a good enough place to dine at whenever I'm on that side of town for poetry, but not a place to really go out of your way for in my opinion. Parking is a little scarce usually have to squeeze a spot on the side of the street or a find a lot a block or so away and work your way back up to the location. All in all, hard to find a good authentic fish taco, so if that's what you have a taste for this place certainly caters to that niche."}
{"text":"We visited because of the DDD segment and the recommendation of our driver. It was definitely good and worth visiting, but I wouldn't quite give it a 100%. The original margarita was good but not great. The rice & beans lacked a distinctive flavor. Highlights: the service was very prompt and friendly, and the lemon shrimp taco and avocado pasta salad were exceptional. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner with the family.  The portions were large and we will have left overs.  Our waitress made a great bear recommendation.  Great place to eat in NoDa"}
{"text":"I had the chicken & shrimp burrito. It was very good, though a bit dry i had asked for extra sauce to go with mine. My sides were rice and beans which was very good. The seafood crab dip is excellent and you get a big plate of it on the appetizer menu."}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing! They get a little flustered when they are busy but the food is wonderful"}
{"text":"Delicious! Fantastic, fresh flavors and friendly, fast service. We tried 5 different types of tacos and they were all to die for! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"No trip to Charlotte would be complete without a stop at CFT. We love the Tuna Tavaroo tacos. We mixed it up and tried the Jerk Swordfish with blackberry and pineapple salsa. Wow! Another new favorite!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding, but don't mix & match tacos thinking you'll pay the higher price of the two.  An additional few $ are added when you do that!  That's not how it used to be done!!!!"}
{"text":"Nightmare!  I went last night with my friends for my birthday:  We waited for over two hours for our table (since they would not take reservations). The original offer for a table (after waiting for an hour already) was to split our party into the two separate rooms of the restaurant at twe very distant tables. The server that offered this was not only curt, but her words were \"it makes it really hard on us\" to seat our party. Personally, having worked in the industry for ten years, i would NEVER say something to this affect to a paying customer!  When we were finally seated, there were only a chips and salsa appetizer for almost fifteen minutes before our order was ever taken. When our food was finally delivered, two of the persons in the group were not served. Their food was not delivered to the table until everyone else was finished with our over cooked and very dry tacos. This was something that was never acknowledged as a short coming on the restaurants behalf. At the risk of sounding cheap, there was never an offer to comp their plates, or compensate in any matter.  When it came time to deliver the bill, the server had no idea who had what. The bills were jumbled, and as a matter of fact some of them were even PAID TWICE (considering one of our party felt sympathetic to the futile efforts of the staff and stayed behind as the rest of the party left and later found out the tab had actually been paid) !!! Fortunately for the server, he was paid AND TIPED double for at least one of the tabs for his less than mediocre efforts. I will NEVER return to this restaurant, and recommend anyone with more than three, or four people in their party not confuse and overwhelm the staff by their presence.   Horrible service, food and poor attitudes!"}
{"text":"My husband goes down to Charlotte often for business and on one trip the group he was went Cabo for lunch, it was the middle of the week and it was also 1:30.  They all raved.   So one night three of that large group and spouses decided to get together and go.  It was a saturday night in Aug.  The place was packed, there was no place for us to wait, they told us atleast an house wait but to check in 30 mins.  We went across the street to a bar and had a drink while waiting, one person from our party went and checked in after 30 mins, they told us 45 more mins.  We then went to finish our drink they walk around and browse in some stores.  We had to stand across the street and wait, there was no place to sit because there were sooooo many people waiting.  We finally got a table, it was right near the bar, which was packed, and had people's butts sticking in our face during our whole dinner.  The place was so loud we could barely hear the waitress.  For as busy as the place was we had ok service.  They had NO chips, ran out of them.    We ordered the Cabo roll to start, my husband that doesn't usually like crab enjoyed them, as did the whole party.  We all enjoyed out dinners, they were very tastey.  We all said we would go back but never again on a Saturday night and I am sure Friday night is the same way."}
{"text":"Let me say first of all  that I'm writing this review with a heavy heart, but I feel the need to be honest.  I have eaten at Cabo Fish Taco a few times before and I have usually really enjoyed the Baja fish tacos and margaritas.  This time, however, was not the same.  The corn salsa was bland and room temperature. The Baja fish tacos were just not good...that's all I can say.  The typically long, crunchy strips of cabbage were replaced with mealy mush that I guess was supposed to pass for some kind of coleslaw and the usually large buttery avocado chunks on top gave way to a sad little spoonful of browning guac at the bottom.  The fish was super fishy and not in a good way.  I always get the nopalitos salad because I'm obsessed with pickled cactus, but this time I found one slice of cactus amongst an entire bowl of bland black beans and chickpeas.  My boyfriend's Rasta Pasta came without shrimp because they were out (wtf??? no shrimp in a seafood restaurant??) and the sauce/chicken had way too much jerk seasoning that overwhelmed the other flavors like peppers and pineapple.  Our waitress was crazy busy and overlooked our empty drinks more than once, then let us sit for 15 minutes while she attempted to settle our tab.  The margaritas, I will say, were strong and tasty...just like I like 'em.  All in all, I was exceedingly underwhelmed and disappointed that the food has gone so far downhill.  Perhaps the biggest kicker of them all....it was my birthday.  Booooooooo."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service with incredible food! Drinks were excellent too. We will absolutely come back! Fish / shrimp tacos were amazing; make sure you get the spicy avocado pasta salad!"}
{"text":"Tried the fish tacos and they weren't really exciting. The place seems like a nice place to hang out and grab some drinks with friends but it's not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! The atmosphere is great, the staff is super nice, and the food is absolutely out of this world! We went on a Sunday, our wait was 20mins until we were seated. We ordered the Queso dip which was served with chips, the spicy mixed with the cheesy was a great taste combination. We also had the BBQ Mahi Mahi tacos. They were cooked to perfection and the combination of tangy and the homemade slaw was perfect! Definitely going to come back again. In the summer they have an open patio which we will be visiting!"}
{"text":"Super long wait, but worth it. You don't have to sit in front of the place. They will text you when your table is ready, so go to the bar next door and have a drink. Everything we tried there has been good. It's one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The whole NoDa area is nice. Well worth eating here."}
{"text":"Parking as always was a hassle, go in expecting that. Service was exceptional, food was fast and hot. The homemade flour tortillas were my favorite part; warm, flaky, and oh so yummy. I suggest sitting outside if available, inside was pretty loud."}
{"text":"It's loud, it's fun, the food is great. Just a solid place for fresh food and a fun atmosphere. Of course, yo have to get the fish tacos, it's practically in the name. Sometimes the wait can be long, so plan accordingly, but overall it's worth it."}
{"text":"We love Cabo fish taco! We especially love their crab dip for appetizer and their tuna taco is to die for!!!! I love their avocado pasta salad too!"}
{"text":"Cabo is a very busy place- even on a Tuesday night! Luckily we were a party of 2 and were seated pretty quick. The food tasted good and fresh, but I had very high expectations based on the reputation they have in Charlotte. I was hoping for a little more flavor.  Contrary to some of the other reviews, I didn't feel rushed even though they were jammin'. I went with a friend and we were catching up for quite a while, but our waitress was friendly and didn't rush us, which I appreciated. Parking can be difficult, like most places in NoDa, so plan to cruise around a little.   Overall I think Cabo has a fun atmosphere for grabbing drinks and something to eat, but it isn't a \"go out of your way\" establishment."}
{"text":"Stopped at Cabo for lunch with the fam. Fantastic fish tacos. So many choices you could eat here a dozen times and not eat the same thing. Had the Tavarua taco--AMAZING flavor. Loved every bite. Had original Caborita to wash it down--very tasty. HIGHLY recommend and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Where to even begin... I LOVE cabo fish taco! I went to Virginia Tech and the other cabo fish taco location is in Blacksburg, VA (where VT is). Whenever I had friends in town I would always try to take them there to eat.  So, I was not surprised to see Cabo Fish Taco high on the list with good reviews when I was visiting Charlotte and I looked up what restaurants were popular in the area. My boyfriend and I decided to check out cabo for lunch so he could get a taste of it for himself. Of course, even cabo fish taco in Charlotte did no disappoint. The restaurant is located in a nice little artsy area known as NODA. Just as you would expect. the interior is something you would imagine for a restaurant near the beach - almost like a surf shack.   I generally always order some form of taco. When in Charlotte, I saw a new one that I haven't tried yet, the TAVARUA (TAV-A-ROO) TUNA TACOS so, of course that's what I went with. Ahhh, these were so good - even our server mentioned that they were her favorite! I didn't really expect them to have a spicy flavor but the honey wasabi sauce definitely added a kick. Also, if you didn't know, you get complimentary chips & corn salsa to start you off which is delicious.  If you haven't been here yet, you should definitely check it out! Whether you're with friends, family, solo, a date - Cabo Fish Taco is very versatile so I think it would be a fitting place for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Always great good here. Definitely worth the wait. I would recommend the Tavarua Tuna Taco's! Absolute favorite of theirs...fast friendly service any time of the day. When it's nice outside, you can enjoy your meal on the front patio and do some people watching. Cool neighborhood too. I'm sure you'll find plenty of things in the area, but you'll keep coming back for more. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"An hour long wait doesn't keep anybody away from CFT.  You put your name on the list and they text you when you're table is ready (bonus - they send you a link right away so you can check the status of the waitlist).  We enjoyed our wait across the street at Growlers Pourhouse.    Once we were seated, our water and drinks arrived very quickly.  What happened next is still an amazing mystery.  We put in our taco order and no less than five minutes later, it all came out.  It was incredible!  Four of us each ordered a duo of CFT signature tacos.  I had the BBQ Mahi and Lemon Shrimp.  The Lemon Shrimp wins between those two hands down.  It is so light and refreshing and perfectly lemony.  The BBQ Mahi is delicious too but on the heavier side with the creamy BBQ sauce.  And my classic margarita washed it all down wonderfully."}
{"text":"This is our first time here. We are impressed and will be back! The service was great, the BBQ Mahi Fish Tacos delicious, and the patio dining very comfortable. Great place!"}
{"text":"The white fish taco is so far the best. I've tried other things, but they are not as good. During busy times, this place is a headache. I ordered something to go on a late Saturday evening and went to Cabos to pick it up. There is nowhere really to stand and wait other than beside the bar, and some rude waitress yelled at me for being in her way. Other than having no designated area just for pickup, the food is good and I will be back."}
{"text":"I went there with my friends and I was disappointed overall. The appetizer, shrimp and crab dip was awesome but our meal was eh. The food was cold, no flavor. It was like eating taco bell 'cause the meat was just too chewy and cold for my liking."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I find it refreshing that they add a fair amount of Spice to their standard dishes. I had the BBQ Mahi taco and it was a home run!!! Great work!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   I ordered the shrimp tacos with rice & beans. I'd give the tacos 4 stars, everything else 3...   Taco orders come with 2 sizable tacos & one side. Mine came with lightly battered & fried shrimp, tomatoes, guacamole, shredded cheese, shredded cabbage (coleslaw style, minus the dressing), and a delicious white sauce on a house-made, slightly crispy white flour tortilla.   The rice was slightly overcooked and the beans slightly under, without much flavor. Also, they serve chips with a mixture of corn, tomato, cilantro & lime juice which is particularly hard to eat. Salsa would've been nice...  Go for the tacos - they got the name right."}
{"text":"Talented chef!  So much flavor!  The spicy avocado salad is so creamy and just the right amount of heat.  One of the best lunches I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how it gets such good reviews. Every time I come I get bad service and bad food. I gave up but a friend wanted to go just for a margarita and queso. The queso was cold and chips were stale. Service also sucked. We got the check (finally) and left without eating to go somewhere else. No one who works here even smiles at you!  We also sat without touching our chips, queso, and guac and no one checked on us at the bar."}
{"text":"Overall? Mostly awesome. We came about 6pm on a Tuesday night. We went to the bar as we were still waiting for another to join our group. We had heard good things about the house margaritas so we decided to try them. Hey, only $6, so not really a risk. Then...OMG....who uses Cuervo in their house margaritas?! They were perfect with the house made sour mix. It was also Mexican Beer night with 1/2 off all said draft beers. We each tried a few that the very friendly and personable bartender recommended. All good. Our bar tab for 5 beers and 2 margaritas ended up being about $20. Not bad at all.  Finally our 3rd guest arrived and we were seated right away. (Quite a rarity, I've heard, even on a weekday night.) The other 2 had the BBQ Mahi tacos and I had the Wahoo. All excellent. The only other place I have had such good fish tacos was in San Diego. Now, it was obvious that the rice and beans that the tacos come with were pre-plated for some time. This is just fine because they tasted great and it's probably the reason our meals arrived less than ten minutes after ordering. Overall a great atmosphere, average service and well above average fish tacos.  -Side Note: The \"Corn Salsa\". Interesting and Unique. I'm not a fan. It's not bad, just not my thing. I prefer a spicier, more tomato based version. I wish they gave a few options."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in two weeks and really enjoy the food. I have gotten the Tavarua (tuna) tacos and the salmon tacos and both have been delicious. The chips and salsa are great. I'll be taking my family there when they visit."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in Charlotte! Having traveled to Mexico and experienced the way fresh, authentic fish tacos are supposed to taste most Charlotte restaurants just can't compare. But Cabo Fish Taco (CFT) nails it.  The NODA atmosphere where CFT is located is artsy and cool. Typically a younger crowd after hours, but very accessible and inviting.  With limited outdoor seating plan ahead, but it's worth it on a cool night."}
{"text":"Top notch taco joint.  It has a cool vibe to the place, and the food is darn tasty and the portions are large. The service is both friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Not well prepared, low quality ingredients...I don't get it. How can your salsa be lame?   The atmosphere is good. The service is functional.   Charlotte eats with its wallet."}
{"text":"I love the Silver Surfer Margarita here. Service can sometimes be spotty but I can overlook that for this place. Lots of beers on tap too! The NODA area is a great place for a night out. Live music, great food and fun people. Cabo is definitely one of my favorite casual restaurant/bars in Charlotte to hang out with friends and people watch. The food has been inconsistent lately. I've been sticking to the Shrimp Tacos. The complimentary chips have been really stale and nasty lately. Love the bigger space and two bar areas as well as the outside seating."}
{"text":"Another restaurant visit inspired by Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Went with my friend while visiting her in Charlotte. Was very excited to try their fish tacos and was not let down!  The meal started with their unique corn salsa, a delicious mix of corn kernels, green bell pepper and tomoatoes served with tortilla chips.  For lunch I ordered their Tuna tacos with a honey wasabi sauce which was served with a side of mashed potatoes mixed with jalapeno peppers sliced in and cheese. The tacos were excellent with plenty of tuna and the wasabi sauce was unique, tasty and had the right amount of kick to it. While mashed potatoes are not usually thought of as a Mexican side dish, they were delicious and the jalapenos and cheese really added to their flavor. The whole meal washed down with a local Charlotte craft beer was the perfect lunch on a cold winter afternoon!"}
{"text":"Decent food! Good service considering how busy it is. Average drink selection. I like the location of this place but it can get a bit crowded and noisy depending on the night. I feel like a bigger space would allow for a better experience since it is a hot spot in NoDa and let's face it: there's just not enough room for everybody! Still give this place four stars though, because these are just minor setbacks. The salsa is fresh and super chunky! Probably one of the best food items."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Cabo Fish taco, you need to go to cabo fish taco. The food is amazing and the tortillas on the tacos SO good! Be prepared to wait outside if you come on a weekend night, but this is the best place for dinner in Noda."}
{"text":"the food is always great when they get your order right and arent rude...therein lies the problem. I've been here 4 times since i've come back to charlotte after being out of town.  I used to regular this place about 3-4 times a week for lunch. The help in this place and the attitude of the people are just \"trashy\" and then they get your order wrong. I got the tavarua and bbq mahi tacos. One time they came out super rare and the waitress told me thats how it comes. The next time the bartender for my togo order leaves mayo cole slaw on bbq mahi tacos when I specifically said I didnt want it. This took up half the conversation when I ordered...couldnt fathom that someone didnt like mayo.  and by the way the tavarua tacos this time werent rare...go figure. I just want to come in and get some level of consistency and accountability when you get it wrong. i'll be back out of hope and loyalty that these 4 times are just some tough times for good help...but one more time is all I got in me before I regular my other spot which is a little further."}
{"text":"The best fish tacos I've ever had!!!! So fresh and not fishy at all. So glad we stopped in while visiting Charlotte! All of the food was amazing, except the guacamole was a bit of a let down and the chips were stale, but did not distract from the amazing tacos. Please open a location in NJ!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good , I had the lemon grilled shrimp tacos. I would Honestly say the customer service was much more better than the food. I would definitely go back for the food and service !"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for reminding me that I added a photo for Cabo forever ago and need to get my butt in gear with writing a review!   I went here quite a few times my time in Charlotte and always enjoyed it. You got superb people watching, cold beers, a decent patio area (albeit more mosquitoes than I care to have around me at one time) and reliable food. As for the inside, I have no clue about it and really don't remember it that much. Hmmmm....that can't be a good sign. But I blame it either on beer or the fact that I always sat outside (even in the fall, again, big hmmmm). The first thing I ever ordered there was the BBQ Mahi Tacos and I never strayed from it because I loved it so much. But I think more of that was due to the tortillas than anything, you could put an old dirty show in one of their tortillas and I would eat because I'm nasty like that. And now I'm in FL craving Cabo, anyone want to overnight it? Thanks!"}
{"text":"My favorite place!!  Pros:  Corn Salsa, Text message table alert, cilantro drizzle, El Cheapo Margarita (a good buy) and patio .  Cons:  Always a wait....even at 2:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday.   Definitely would try if you have not but plan to wait."}
{"text":"That BBQ Mahi Mahi should receive a Grammy!!!   Great service by waitress and mangers were nice, as well.  They checked on us a few times.  Great experience"}
{"text":"Mediocre food.  Absurd wait times.  Cilantro in every pore of the meal.  REALLY REALLY LOUD. Cabo, I'm just not that into you."}
{"text":"Originally from the Baja area, this NC location does it justice so you won't be disappointed when you come by for an original taco! All of the fish tacos are excellent, but i suggest you also consider the Mango BBQ Mahi Mahi Tacos - it's great!"}
{"text":"There's a reason Cabo is always packed to the brim with people - this place is delicious. As a vegetarian, I'm pretty pleased with their veggie selection. Their teriyaki-kiwi tofu is AMAZING. I was really blown away. It's a very unique flavor that they pull off marvelously.   A waiter will immediately bring your table chips and salsa - but be aware it's corn salsa and it's messy to eat and not particularly flavorful. I wish their fajitas came with avocado/guacamole, but that may be a personal preference. I also had a \"skinny\" margarita and it was the perfect balance of alcohol and lime and whatever else they throw in there. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting to try this place for YEARS since coming to town from Raleigh for a concert, but its always so packed when we're there. I finally discovered they do take out, so we by-passed the hour wait (at 8:30 on Friday night) and ordered food at the bar. We got chips and the amazing tomatillo salsa while we waited, and luckily, by the time the food came out (which wasn't long), two seats opened up at the bar and we got to eat there. And lemme tell you... It was well worth the wait. The beer battered tacos were out of this world. My husband had the mahi, which I liked on its own, but liked my taco more. The avocado pasta salad was the winning side- my black beans and rice were a little bland. But overall, it definitely lived up to the hype!"}
{"text":"I adore the food at Cabo. The BBQ mahi tacos are fantastic. My last trip in town I tried the salmon tacos and those were even better (hard to imagine anything better than the BBQ mahi!). Queso and guac are also good.   Ritas are alright.   Hostesses are hit or miss. Sometimes they are as southern friendly as can be but most times its the typical too cool for anything Noda vibe."}
{"text":"The wait is incredibly long Saturday night but worth it! Don't get the guac (nothing special and portion size is small and not a size to share despite its $7charge). I got the BBQ mahi mahi taco which was great! I definitely recommend it! The taco has a crunchy but soft shell."}
{"text":"We went here based on good reviews , but never got a chance to try the food. It was our anniversary and we just wanted a quiet place to sit. The snotty girl who seated us tried to sit my 6 foot 4 husband and I in a super small table which hangs halfway into a door jam. We asked if we could sit somewhere else and she put us up at the front where there was heavy traffic . We just asked if we could possibly sit somewhere a little more quieter and she offered us to sit outside when it was about to start raining !!!Really??? The whole other side of the restaurant was darker and quieter and she would not budge so we left... Sorry so here is a bad review for you because of your not so nice employee !"}
{"text":"Can 14 years make a difference in the life of a restaurant?  At Cabo Fish Taco the answer is a resounding NO!  The last time before this week that I had a meal there was 2000.  At the end of my meal I remarked that the fish was overcooked, tasteless and served barely above room temperature.  The service was at best mediocre.  As we were in the area, a friend suggested we go there for lunch.  I hesitated for a moment, but then figured they had to get better after 14 years.  WRONG!  Someone please tell me how/why this place is still in business!  Whatever that corn stuff they bring to the table is was horrible.  None of the condiments at the table could make it much better.  Our waitress (in training) was pleasant enough.  She recommended a daily special - Curried Fish (trout I believe) Taco.  I had actually been in the mood for Indian food that day, so a Curried Fish Taco sounded like just the thing.  WRONG!  The curry flavor was so diluted that it tasted as though someone sprinkled just a dash of cheap curry powder on the fish while cooking.  Jenny's Cabo's Signature Taco (beer battered white fish) was dry, overcooked, and EXTRA crunchy.  I surely would not want my signature on that!  Perhaps I will wait another 14 years to see if they are able to earn that third star...."}
{"text":"Casual and excellent food.  Great beer selection."}
{"text":"glad to see more people are coming around on this......for the food choices there are about 2 dozen places in charlotte to get better; in NODA its at the bottom of the list of the fooderies in that area...so why is it still there???....I know I know the answer is found every week in those Observer LAZY DAYS party pix of all the 'cool\" people going to the \"cool\" bars; they support crap like this"}
{"text":"Lets get right to it; if you name your place after one particular dish, that item needs to really deliver the goods. Yeah, the fish taco is flat out spectacular! Here's why I like this so much ...   When you order any of the tacos, you get 2 tacos and a side. The restaurant has  a very nice policy that allows you to mix and/or match your tacos. So have a fish taco and have a chicken taco or whatever taco on the same plate. I like that. Each taco comes to the table like a nice big overstuffed hoagie that you eat kind of openfaced. Cabo Fish Taco has figured out how to prevent this from turning into a giant sloppy mess as you munch your way through the meal. The tortilla is wonderfully crispy, a little flakey, and pliable at the same time while not being at all greezy. No idea how they do that?? It holds up perfectly during numerous pick-ups. And it tastes great ... delivering a fresh homemade flavor that will make you feel like you are sampling a family-secret-recipe.  We've eaten there for several lunches, so I have had the chance to sample some of the other non-taco dishes. All very good but I'm happily stuck in taco mode. One quick word about the sides ... the server recommended their spicy pasta side dish. It was perfectly very spicy hot and the pasta was perfectly al dente. Really nice execution.  One last thought about why Cabo Fish Taco gets 5 stars is due to the atmosphere of the place. Very nice and friendly, casual relaxed vibe. Terrific service. Very nice bar thing going on, which I haven't sampled but it's front and center stage. You can't miss it and it lends the place a nice relaxing backdrop.  Give this place a shot, I bet you will really like it!"}
{"text":"My sister, my brother in law and i went here last night and it was wonderful!  Pete our server was terrific!  He was fast, nice and had an awesome margarita suggestion!  Only issue we ran into was that the fajitas where a little salty and my jalapeno mashed potatoes didn't have the cheese melted on it but everything else was delish!! Totally coming back and hope we get Pete again, that guy is the bee's knees plus his beard would make any man jealous :)"}
{"text":"BUSY ALL THE TIME!! Every time I eat at Cabo it's packed. Doesn't seem to matter if it's on a monday night or a friday night. They are always hopping. One thing's for sure, though, the food is worth the wait! I haven't had anything I didn't LOVE here! My usual are the bbq mahi tacos with a side of slaw. YUM. Just the right amount of spice for me on the tacos and the slaw is delicious. The beer selection is pretty great and they have margaritas galore. Parking can be tricky because NODA has limited spaces near the main drag. Be prepared to walk a little."}
{"text":"Always AWESOME Food, great staff, and now they can text you when you table is ready which is perfect."}
{"text":"Delicious fish tacos.  It's a little crowded, but the food was great."}
{"text":"It wasn't the worst but I gotta say the chips they have for appetizers are very stale and cold. The food was cold and not fresh..it tasted as if it got microwaved from a freezer or something..but they did have one taco which was pretty good but once again..it wasn't fresh..a little below average for the price..I've been to much cheaper Mexican places where it was absolutely delicious and worth it for the low price..I wouldn't pay as much as I did again for a place like this..but employees were friendly"}
{"text":"Live in Miami. Was in Charlotte and had a recommendation from someone in Miami that if I ever go back to Charlotte I had to come here. I eat a lot of fish tacos. I typically don't delve into the realm of baja(breaded) and didn't here either. The tortillas for the blackened fish tacos were amazing. Made me a believer. I am moving to charlotte on June 1 and you better believe this will be one of my first stops on the checklist every week!"}
{"text":"So cute and tucked away on a street corner. I loved the vibe this place gave me. We went right when they first opened up (time wise, not grand opening) so we practically had this place all to ourselves. The decor was cute.   We order a few different tacos my lunch date had a few spicy ones that he really enjoyed. I'm pretty much a wimp and stuck with all the safe options. You get a lot of food for the money and the price point was decent. Nothing too crazy.   If you're in the area stop by it's definitely worth a try. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! I know it's been around for a while and my best friend has been recommending it to me for years. We went for lunch on a hot day, but still chose to sit outside on the patio- it was lovely! Shaded and there was a ceiling fan, so we weren't uncomfortable at all. I felt like I was on vacation in a tropical place!  The chips and salsa weren't anything special. The chips tasted a little stale tbh, and the salsa was mostly corn and not very flavorful. But I got the Tavarua Tuna Tacos and LOVED them. Extra star on this review just for these tacos- so flavorful and fresh. I would definitely order them again! My husband also enjoyed his lemony shrimp tacos.   The service was also lovely. The food came out quickly. A good meal!"}
{"text":"It was the first weekend of springtime weather following this horrendous winter, and we were determined to get around Charlotte. Perfect weather means spending time outside, and that always means a trip to NoDa. And NoDa means good (cheap) food. I want to branch out and try all of the street's fabled offerings but today it was back to a tried and true favorite after a long winter of hibernation: Cabo Fish Taco. They have never done me wrong.  Over the winter they seem to have expanded. A second room has doubled their capacity. And today they needed it all. We were squeezed in amongst the most diverse crowd you'll find in Charlotte - a refreshing reminder that the world is more interesting than the Uptown bar scene. You'll find that all over NoDa, but here especially. I was a little nervous that with the expansion, and with the beautiful day bringing out so many people, the staff might be overwhelmed. Our waitress was a little harried, but she managed to efficiently serve a dozen tables - polite, even if she didn't have time to chat.   Per Bill F's suggestion I went for the blackened mahi-mahi signature taco, and it was awesome. Awesome. That white cilantro sauce is to die for. My only complaint is that I didn't see their complementary salsa on the menu. That stuff was so good I would have loved to buy another serving. It is probably for the best; I couldn't have managed another plate anyway. Just enough room for some Tasty Yo across the street..."}
{"text":"BOMB dot com. Don't ask questions. Don't read reviews. Just go. Have fun. Stay thirsty my friends."}
{"text":"The crab & shrimp dip is excellent! The tacos are too. Just be careful. This food is spicy! It's delicious but spicy!  The waitress was excellent. I also love that they give you free chips & salsa. I absolutely can not wait to go back there!"}
{"text":"I had barbecue mahi and beer battered fish tacos with black beans and rice. No avacado tho because I can't eat it. At any rate they were totally overstuffed totally delish, fresh and fabulous. We had a hour wait which is ok because that gave us an opportunity to walk around and get a drink. Using the phone to alert you when your table is ready lets you wander and check out and support other local businesses. Kudos to Cabo for doing this.  Great meal and good fun and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is incredible - Love that they text you when your table is ready so you can get a drink at one of the many bars on North Davidson while you wait.  Fish tacos are probably the best I've ever had (never been to California so I may not be the best judge), any assortment is good but my personal favorite are the Salmon and BBQ Mahi.  To be honest though, if the fish tacos were mediocre I'd still come for the avocado pasta salad alone- unreal.  Moved away from NoDa in April and still trying to find an excuse to get back so that we can go to Cabo."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME over in the NODA area. We have made the way over from South Charlotte on several occasions and have NEVER been disappointed. They have a standard menu of the typical taco choices, however they ALWAYS have a special two choices wrote on the ever so colorful chalk board along with the drink specials.. The staff is varies which is pretty cool, they include tatted up people, college students, Goth, Hippy, Happy, etc.. EVERYONE work well together and are all HAPPY to be there working and appear to LOVE their job. I must say the ladies room on the left side of the venue is pretty funny. The door has a lady on it and when you enter you enter to one sink and two toilets with no separation between the two commodes other than a small wicker basket with 3 drawers containing tissue. THIS IS PRETTY AWESOME to me ONLY because it has been several times that me and the ladies have gone out and we all have to go equally as bad and with this set up we can go at the same time.. NOT SURE I'D WANT TO only because that's awkward squatting next to your friend. What type of conversation happens when you are squatting next to your girlfriend LOL.. I LIKE it for taking my daughter to the restroom with me as we are able to go in at the same time and have an additional commode if she get the urge while waiting on me..  Enough about the LADIES ROOM.. Some of my many check-ins are below with what I was indulging in with the Mr. or with my daughter or with the Ladies:     Jerk Salmon & Grilled Mahi Tacos!  the chipotle lime salmon taco & beer battered shrimp taco is a winning combination ;-)  Blacken Seabass taco special is a must!!  The chips & in house fresh salsa is SPICY & AWESOME. Any of the various fish tacos are great I LOVE the grilled Mahi Mahi & Shrimp taco..  Salsa & Chips is very TASTY & a tad bit Spicy which I LOVE!!   Cons: There is a SERIOUS wait time on the weekends in the evening as the place is popular. Not sure if that's a CON because it's GREAT BUSINESS for a GREAT restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been back to Cabo Fish Taco several times since my initial review.  We went again this past Sunday afternoon for a late lunch/early dinner.  It was still pretty busy, despite the off time, but thankfully not like a Friday or Saturday night.    The complimentary chips and corn salsa are excellent, but there's hardly enough time to eat them because the entrees come out SO quick.  And that's not a bad thing.  Almost always, I order Honey Wasabi Tuna Burrito (minus the mushrooms) with the tuna cooked rare.  It's always so freakin' delicious with that sweet spicy flavor that I can't stop ordering it.  This time around, though, I decided to be daring.  I ordered the Tavarua (tav-a-roo) Tuna Tacos.  I know -- so off the wall, right?  It's pretty much the tuna burrito minus the rice.  Upon delivery, the tuna was literally spilling out of the taco shells.  That's how much tuna there was.  I picked one chunk up with my fork and ate it.  OMG.  It was incredibly flavorful, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  Since I had never had their tacos before, I was amazed at how delicious they were, too.  The shells were super fresh (I'm assuming handmade/cooked), and they were a little puffy and soft, but with some crunch.  Wow!    A side comes with the entrees, and I usually order the Nopalito Salad.  It's light and refreshing.  Oddly, this time around, there were hardly any nopalitos (prickly pear cactus pads) in it, but the chickpeas and black beans were good.    The service was fantastic, too, and I think I've found my new favorite \"usual\" at Cabo Fish Taco."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I decided to stop in after a few beers over at Heist brewery. Started off pretty bad ass we ended up getting a parking spot right across the street from the restaurant. We got a table right away and the waitress was there in nothing flat with chips and salsa.  my fiancee had the wasabi chicken burrito which was great it had a good wasabi flavor. She also had the cheapo margarita which she seemed to enjoy.I had the two taco platter i couldn't decide so the waitress said try one of each. So i had the BBQ mahi taco it was excellent and i also had the lemon grilled shrimp. we will definitely return here when we go back to Heist brewery or maybe NODA or birdsong."}
{"text":"Love this place. The beers are usually pretty well priced (2$ specials) and the food itself is a great value. I never leave there hungry or being disappointed with the meal. The free corn salsa they give you with chips is delicious and has a little zing to it because of the red onion they mix in imo. I've also had plenty of the cheese dip appetizer over the years and it has a kind of \"smokey\" taste to it that sets it apart from a regular white cheese you would get at a lot of mexican restaurants.   The tacos are all well prepared and my personal favorite is the BBQ Mahi tacos. I probably get that at least 2 out of every 4 trips there. A lot of the other times I will try out whatever the special is they are having. I tried the scallop wrap yesterday and while the scallops themselves tasted a little overdone (I'm guessing its extremely difficult to cook a perfect scallop) it was still a great meal.   The only thing I think they could work on, and this is something I have noticed over the years, is that it seems like a lot of the time they run out of the specials. May just be a testament to the restaurants popularity but if the special is no longer available please take the eraser to the chalkboard so my taste buds don't get all worked up for nothing,"}
{"text":"The tables were turning over pretty quickly but a LOT of people were waiting for a spot on a busy Saturday night, so we waited an hour and 15 minutes (as quoted by the hostess) for our table.  It was well worth the wait!   Btw - the staff was busting their bums getting everyone accommodated for.  They were polite and efficient given the amount of folks waiting for tables!  I liked the happening vibe at CFT.     We were headed to Neighborhood Theater for a later show, so we had time to hang out and have a few drinks, chips, and salsa while we waited.  The chips & salsa were so-so, but I was so hungry we devoured a whole basket!  I personally like a spicier, more  tomato-ey salsa, but that's just me.  My battered shrimp taco was OUTSTANDING!  I loved the flavor of the shrimp and the tortilla was delicious.  My chicken taco was good too, but I could have devoured more than one of those shrimp puppies.  The barbecue mahi was pretty darn delicious too.  NoDa is a cool neighborhood...we'd definitely come back for more tacos and another show!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Shrimp tacos and pomegranate margaritas are the best. Go early when there's less of a wait and it's less noisy"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ tacos with their coleslaw and it was so so good. Atmosphere was ok, went at lunch time so maybe that's why but none the less we will be back, great little spot."}
{"text":"I will never step foot in this establishment again. This is my 3rd time here and the service has yet to improve. Waiter/Waitresses are continuously very cold not personable. Moving on the food was below average ( chicken fajita  - blackened tuna salad) tuna was over cooked and the fajita  was thrown together! The waiter could obviously notice the tuna was not prepared as we requested however failed to ever ask if we enjoyed our dish. We feared speaking up about the matter due to the poor service and chances of food contamination."}
{"text":"Like pretty much everyone else who has rated this place I'd be stating the obvious when I say that the tacos here are amazing.  This is a restaurant that I take my friends when they come from out of town.  Staff has always been very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Love the freshness of the food and friendly service. The chips and corn salsa are so great. I've been 4 times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Good and fun location.  The environment is upbeat and lively. Servers are friendly.   The food is amazing. Fresh and flavorful. The salsa alone is to die for.  The beer is good and the daily deal affordable. The lemon shrimp tacos are so good and the avocado pasta is unique and tasty.  Try this you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great location Mediocre food. Limited menu, the bar isn't too appealing look to it and the bar tenders were rude seeing as though I'm 22 and probably assumed I wouldn't tip accordingly. Haven't been back."}
{"text":"Best tacos!!! And the pasta salad is dank. And omg the fried pita chips in the crab dip..."}
{"text":"4 out of 5 because I don't love the chips & salsa. A little bland for me. But.. Cabo is one of my faves in Charlotte. I love the fun loud atmosphere, you feel like you are in Cali. I always order the barbecue mahi mahi tacos. A little sweet a little savory, the texture of the fish is perfect & I love how the sauce brings it all together. So delicious. You have to try to jalapeño mashed potatoes. They are awesome! Not too spicy, you just get little kicks in every bite. I love this place & always brig people here."}
{"text":"Fun place with good food and a friendly atmosphere. I tried the Tuna Tacos with the wasabi honey sauce. Didn't like them personally, but that was due to me not the way they were served. The tuna was cooked beautifully. I kindly asked for something else and told them I was still happy to pay for that dish. The manger came out without me asking and said that he wouldn't let me pay for something I didn't enjoy. Some of the best customer service I have ever had. Tried another dish and loved it. Wish I lived closer so I could go to this restaurant more."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've been to Cabo Fish Tacos. This place has the best tacos ever. I had the Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos. They literally made me do a happy dance. The avocado pasta was delicious too. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This small dive is overall good! They have what their name states, Fish Taco's!  It is very good, but a bit pricy! You get a little less then you would expect portion wise, but the taste for the food is good! The atmosphere is really great! Very fun place to go for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"We enjoy making the drive to Cabo. Roughly about 45 min. Cabo is consistently excellent!"}
{"text":"Laid back vibe, good food and portions.  I mostly wanted to write this overdue review because of Rafaela, our awesome waitress.  She seemed to have a bunch of tables going at once, but was very attentive to us, and provided great service!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I travel to CLT every month and have been doing so for the past 3 years. My weekend spot is always Cabo to reconnect with area friends. My experience last was horrible, not the food but the service. I chopped it up to maybe that waitress had a bad day but I was still going to tell her manager. This past weekend, I connected with a friend there who really wanted to try it out and I put our name down for a table. They text you when your table is available. I realized I received a text msg 2 minutes earlier. We go in and the hostess is talking to someone with a red bull can in her hand about what I don't know but we waited for about 35 seconds (yes, I timed it) to finish talking.  I finally after about 10 more seconds, said \"Hey, we have a text, I think our table is available?\"The hostess looked at us, KEPT talking and turned back around. I say \"excuse me\" She says, \"Yes, I heard you but I'm talking to someone else\" AND SHE TURNS BACK AROUND. It was by the grace of God I didn't slap curse her out. I was about to leave however, my friend wanted to stay and someone immediately walked us to a table. All she could've done was acknowledge us if that convo was that important. I immediately called the manager, I think his name was Walter, who was very apologetic. Get this, he was already kind of aware of the situation and offered us a free appetizer. I declined it but my friend asked for queso but rest assured, I will NEVER go to that restaurant again. They just lost a faithful customer of 3 years who travels down to have a good time at that restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the tacos have a lot of meat/fish in them, so two is enough and I tend to be a big eater  Their corn salsa was awesome as well (I'm usually not a fan of corn salsa)  I took the bartender's recommendation and got their two most popular tacos, the mahi and wahoo.  Just fantastic flavors.  I don't do the accompanying sauces so they may be better or worse with those added (I hate Mayo and sour cream)  I do know the seasonings on their own were fairly bold and grabbed the taste buds just right.    The decor is great and makes you feel almost like you're about to hit the beach.  It was a great start to my vacation with my brother.    NoDa is a pretty cool neighborhood as well so be sure to walk around a bit  Cabo Fish Taco is where I think I will be going from now on when I land in your fair city"}
{"text":"They should highly consider accepting reservations and/or utilize open table..their process of seating patrons is flawed and needs to be assess and improved.  The fact that if you miss your name being called and are automatically seated ahead of those who are still waiting outside the door,  is absurd!  The (gentleman) hostess needs to understand that arguing with patrons is not appropriate or appreciated, remember you are in the service industry.  The reason the hostess felt it was ok to holler at me is because his General Manager thought his actions were appropriate. What kind of leadership and people development environment is that?  If you prefer places where you are treated with respect than go to Cantina or Loco Lime. Oh and the skinny margarita sucks."}
{"text":"TRY THE BBQ MAHI MAHI TACOS!! This place was on point. Busy as hell and the service was amazing. The food came out fast, hot, and delicious. Chicken Tacos, Diablo Salad, you cannot make a wrong choice....and their Sangaritas are to die for."}
{"text":"Good food, good location.  For the people that are complaining about the free chips being stale, its kinda hard to find a place where the free chips aren't stale.  Service has something to be desired."}
{"text":"Having moved to Ohio, I can only say that I REALLY MISS CABO FISH TACO. We made a trip back to visit Charlotte and this was the first place we visited.   PS. You can make the honey wasabi sauce at home- 1 part honey, 1 part wasabi paste. It really is that easy and has made the lack of Cabo a bit more bearable."}
{"text":"Everyone has an off day. I say that's okay. But when you have waitresses that are not polite, food that comes out one hour after you have ordered them and not cooked to how you've asked them, then you know that something's gotta give. This was obviously not the first time and what makes it difficult to be understanding about these bad experiences, is that they didn't happen on a weekend when they were busy. It happened on a rather mildly busy day, at best. So yeah... I love their food. But I'm afraid my money would be best spent in a place that has both good food, but also good service."}
{"text":"glad they expanded! as for a review it is simple, i am going to say this and only this..... best fish tacos in town...period"}
{"text":"The food was just excellent and the service was great.  If I had one thing negative... The food came out so fast I had just started on my first beer.  Local beer as well.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Loved the place. Saw it on triple d plus I have a app that shows you restaurants that have been on triple d and man vs food so I always try to check at least one out in the city I'm in. Great tacos really friendly staff"}
{"text":"'Over-ra-ted.  Clap clap, clap lap clap'  I really don't understand why people geek over this place, man.  Just because Guy Fieri went hear doesn't mean you will get a food-rection, by default.  I feel this is a poor representation of what Charlotte's culinary cuisine has to offer.  That being said, if you really want to, knock yourself the hell out....  But, I could find you a better spot, friend."}
{"text":"I have been OBSESSED with Cabo Fish Taco lately! I randomly get a hankering for cool, fresh, fish tacos and my brain immediately screams \"Cabo!\". Usually, I answer it and head to NODA where I can munch on tacos and hot crab dip.   The service is always on point here. I even once had a server plug up my dying iPhone by the server stand so I could keep an eye on work things over dinner. I tried to offer her $5 for charging my phone even though we had moved to a different server's section and she refused to take it! Good peeps over there.  The decor and vibe of Cabo is very NODA-esque and fun. It reminds me of grabbing a bite to eat at a restaurant in Florida after a long day on the beach. The patio can seat quite a few people and is good for some interesting people-watching! There are also TV's at the bar if you don't want to miss a game.   Cabo has an extensive margarita menu and a decent beer selection as well. But the best thing about this pace is the delicious food. You just can't go wrong with any taco you order from the menu. I think their Taveroo (sp?) and Blackened Mahi might be the best, though. :) Every table receives fresh corn salsa and chips before their meal and I always end up filling up on that stuff too early because it's so dang good! The food always tastes so fresh and is packed with delicious flavor. I've never had anything bad here, nor had a bad experience. I love this place and it's a no-brainer for the summer!"}
{"text":"This was the second time in a row that I was sadly disappointed in Cabo Fish Taco. First, I had the Mahi  taco and it is was so fishy to the point I couldn't eat it. I wanted to try Cabo again, as I thought it could have been a one time event type situation. Last night I got tuna tacos and again it was so fishy I couldn't even eat it. This tells me the fish Cabo gets is old...  I will never return and will not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! A perfect balance btwn the meat & sides. Usually you get too much of one & not enough of the other... Here... they have a balance, along w/the match of seasonings. My wife agrees, but also she said that the Margarita is a perfect size & a true blend of alcohol. Will defntly frequent them more often!!!"}
{"text":"READ THIS FIRST! Review from one who disliked cabo fish taco.   Entires ordered:  - blackened chicken quesadilla;  - epic tuna burrito;  - blackened mahi mahi tacos;  - blackened grilled amberjack tacos (on special)  This is my second visit to this restaurant, previously I would haven given this -1/2 star.   Chips and salsa:  the other 3 in the party loved the salsa, it is a corn/tomato salsa. Personally, I am not a fan of this type of salsa, I like the traditional kind so I'm not able to provide an unbiased review. The chips have a stale texture, this is consistent from both visits, this may be just how the chips are supposed to be. Not a fan personally here either.   Entrees:  Blackened chicken quesadilla (mine) - not your standard quesadilla, not overloaded with cheese. Good balance of chicken-to-cheese ratio. The blackening is second to none, this was an pleasant surprise and delivered a very nice kick. Onions and peppers were good, not too much, just the right amount. I don't eat seafood, that's why I didn't get a \"fish taco.\"   Epic tuna burrito- very good, comparable in quality/flavor of fresh California fish (according to the diner)  Blackened mahi tacos- delicious.   Blackened amberjack - the diner went on and on about these, refused to try anything else because she didn't want to \"ruin her palate.\" (Tad dramatic if you ask me, but what do I know).   My review rating is based upon my entrée and the opinions voiced by my cohorts. They truly loved everything (although they did share my feelings on the \"stale chips\").   My original experience was terrible, I don't remember what I had exactly but it was bad enough that I successfully boycotted this place 3 years. However, after the blackened chicken quesadilla, I will be willing to return.   Also, one had a Bloody Mary (on special) and said it was \"delicious.\"   Note: parking is a real pain, just be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Place was a NoDa legend but has slipped. Last few times were 2 or 3 star at best. Place has a ton of character but just not focused on giving excellent food. Margaritas = not good (cmon! It's mex!). Tortillas = stale (isn't this a staple for a place like this?). Entrees are hit and miss.   That said, I hope they get things on track and they stick around."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for business and asking around for places to eat in Uptown, when a friend recommended I try somewhere in the Noda area while I was here.  I was not disappointed.    Cabo Fish Taco was great for the large group I had. Decent, attentive service and overall the food was really good.  I ordered the tuna taco, carne asada taco, and the avocado pasta salad.  The tuna was a bit too salty, and my tortillas were pretty greasy, but overall I really enjoyed all of the big flavors (and huge portions). I definitely recommend checking this place out if you want a cheaper meal that doesn't skimp on the food or the taste.  And the house margaritas are pretty good, too!"}
{"text":"Cabo is one of my favorite local places for Mexican cuisine - it's a little more upscale than your authentic Mexican place, but the atmosphere screams fun, social drinking, and good food. Plus, it's in the great Noda neighborhood, where the whole street is filled with great restaurants and bars you can hop in and out of.  The menu is very varied, and offers a mix of Mexican cuisine as well, with their infamous fish tacos. Very eclectic menu and atmosphere overall and great for groups. Their bbq mahi mahi fish tacos are probably my favorite dish (I usually always order fish) and their salmon comes very well-flavored as well.   The salsa that comes with the chips is very good and addicting, with their pico de gallo/corn mixture. I always get seconds and thirds. They also have a lengthy margarita list, if you are a tequila lover, which I assume you are if you are contemplating Cabo. !  Great spot for groups, beer drinking, or margarita drinking"}
{"text":"Wandered in one day to grab a cold beer on a hot day and ended up staying for 5 hours! The bartenders are very friendly and keep full beer in front of you. The bar it self is tiny but doesn't detract from this place at all."}
{"text":"Steak taco...awesome. White fish taco...par. Chips and salsa...sub par. Price was ok for what we got so that was good. Very loud place and parking is kinda annoying over there."}
{"text":"The food tastes amazing!  Never had a thing on the menu that I didn't enjoy.  Lemon grilled shrimp tacos are a favorite!"}
{"text":"Delicious shrimp tacos. A great, swinging spot if you are in the mood for California-style texmex. Margaritas are delicious and STRONG. Enjoy with a DD."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here around 4 on a Saturday afternoon after spending a couple of hours at the Dog Bar. We were pretty hungry although it was not quite yet dinner time, so we just wanted something to nosh on.   We decided to go here after all the rave reviews we had from friends. We were immediately seated and our drink orders taken. We decided to split the queso and a chicken quesadilla. Our waitress (as listed per the receipt) was JWOO. She was spunky with piercings and was perfect. She was quick and even asked the kitchen to split the quesadilla between 2 plates since we were splitting (that goes a long way).   The food was excellent, although I think the queso is meant to be taken down in 5 minutes, because once it starts cooling off it can get a bit hard.   Overall we had a great time and will be back, especially if going to Dog Bar."}
{"text":"Fish and shrimp tacos are great..LOVE the sauce!! The sides that come with the meal are awful tho. The parking sucks. Last time went on my lunch break..had to park almost 2 blocks away!! Did I say the sauce is really Gooooood?? Lol"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me out to dinner here for my birthday and we had a wonderful time! The salsa and chips they brought out was delightful and our drinks came quickly. We ordered tacos, he got the mahi mahi and I got the carnita. I want to eat what I had every day for the rest of my life! I got the spicy avocado pasta salad for my side and it was soooo good! Our waitress was kind and attentive. If I lived in the NoDa area I would definitely empty my paycheck here more often. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The tuna tacos were awesome. They almost always have a wait, but if you are not in a hurry it is well worth it. The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The only thing that kept them out of 5 starts is the fact that they didn't accept call aheads. They have a large selection of local beers that are found in every bar in NoDa. I would go there again if I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill so badly in the past few years. Several of my friends have even been sick- one had food poisoning.  What happened? It used to actually be good. Food is awful.  The salsa and chips is even bad. Better off getting some from the grocery store"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos, very interesting flavors, and good service.  Cool and cozy atmosphere, and great margaritas."}
{"text":"This place only having 3 and 1/2 stars is a joke!!!!  These tacos are awesome, quite possibly one of the best meals I've ever had!!  Quality and quantity of food was top notch!!! Service was incredibly good!!!!  We had the chips, salsa, queso, jalapeño beer, margaritas, fish and chicken tacos and everything was perfect!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Finally made it here over the weekend for lunch. My mom and I were both very impressed. The salsa you get when you sit down is great and the chips are good though I wish they were served hot. The queso dip was on point. I love that they use the white queso. We also got the grilled shrimp tacos and the fried white fish tacos. The white fish tacos were amazing. The shrimp ones were good. They could put a little more sauce on the tacos. The tortilla shells themselves were GREAT! Freshly fried and perfectly crispy. The refried beans had rice in them which I didn't see on the menu. The spicy pasta salad was okay.   4.5 stars but rounded down for the waiter. Our server was kind of rude when my mom asked what the spicy pasta salad was. His response: exactly what it says it is...spicy pasta salad. He clearly had an attitude and did not smirk or smile when he said it. And then when my mom  (taken aback) said oh ok... so its pasta and spices? The guy then rattles of a laundry list of ingredients including pasta cheese jalapenos etc etc. Clearly it wasn't \"exactly what it said it was\". He could have been friendlier overall. Rest of staff was great!"}
{"text":"4 stars instead of 5 because I found their complimentary chips especially stale.  Everything else - amazing.  I brought my boyfriend here from out of town, and this was his absolute favorite restaurant out of all the other places we ate at.  A big reason was because they serve complimentary house corn salsa with their chips - he LOVES corn salsa.  (Though I think their corn salsa bowl can be much more generous.)    They're tacos are delicious and unique - love their soft taco shells!!! They're fried but still soft and decadent.  Amazing.  I ordered both types of fish taco on the menu, and they were great.  Will definitely order again.  Ambiance/decoration - lively, colorful & fun.  I absolutely love the Day of the Dead paintings - which I could take them down and have them in my own apartment.  A great place to eat casually with friends, with drinks, and to also take your family.  Most unique/fun restaurant I've found so far since I've moved to Charlotte actually."}
{"text":"Gotta love it when a \"trendy, hipster\" restaurant uses canned products. Canned corn, canned refried beans, canned jalepenos...not worth the money for these kinds of products... Stale chips, average tacos (we had blackened mahi mahi) and over priced beers. 5 bucks for a draught beer? Come on now!! My wife and I have eaten here several times and have tried various items on the menu. We always seem to be disappointed after eating here. And before we get reamed and told to stay in, we normally do The wait staff is awesome and attentive to the patrons...no problem here. Everyone is friendly and I think this is what brings us back for the most part....that and the fact we love the NoDa area. However the food is just average for us...."}
{"text":"If you need a mini vacation, the colorful and expansive references to Baja California are appreciated.  C.F.T. is a great spot for lunch, especially on a sunny day, no matter how cold it is outside.  Not much of a seafood person, I got the tacos and was able to get both steak and chicken at the waitress' recommendation.  The chicken is nicely spicy. The steak was a little under-salted but high quality beef and cooked tender.  Service was impeccable and friendly.  She even threw in a few \"hey dudes\" for good measure.  The house corn salsa is chunky and fun.  I wasn't wild about the tomatillo salsa because it had too many onions.  I went for the cactus salad as my side for the tacos and wasn't crazy about it either.  Next time I'll just get the black beans and rice which reprises the fresh corn and has no onions.  I didn't realize the tacos are served on a bed of cabbage so next time I'll ask for them to skip that part.  And I'm glad I asked for the cream based sauce on the side. But everything still had a lot of flavor even after a picky eater like me takes it apart.  Next time I'll order a margarita from their specialty drink menu since they offer my beloved Herradura amidst their impressive tequila selection!"}
{"text":"I would have taken away a star because there is absolutely no parking but the food made up for it. I got the bbq Mahi tacos. The portion size was huge! The tacos were overflowing with yummy. The avacado side  pasta was creamy and spicy. My taste buds were very satisfied. I couldn't believe how fast my food came out too. I'm talking 5mins! I wish this place wasn't surrounded by gravel lots that are pay to park."}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco...you have been talked about and talked about from FoodNetwork to all-over-Charlotte.  I don't tend to veer towards baja-Mexican cuisine, but was with a group so Cabo it was...and I was excited to try because, well, simply said, I'm a tequila girl. I was ready to get my hands on a nice blanco on the rocks...until I didn't. Why? Because I couldn't.  I asked if they had cazadores? Nope. I looked quickly at the margarita menu since there wasn't a tequila menu (still scratching my head about this), and ended up with El Jimador, which I took approximately 2 1/2 sips out of because I couldn't do it. No no, I wasn't going to let this ruin my tequila.  The girls' tacos looked fabulous but I went with a salad for two reasons: 1. I don't love soft shells 2. gluten and corn-free. The options for dietary restrictions aren't terribly limited here, but they aren't great. Nothing on the menu is labeled, so you definitely need to mention to your server specifications. You very rarely hear me complain about cost in reviews, I'm fine with spending on quality, but I thought $7 upcharge to add chicken was VERY high so considering my salad was over $16.00 but their other salad that happens to have chicken on it costs $12.50 and the salmon salad was $13.95. Again, scratching my head."}
{"text":"Food is always good, but this time we had an issue with the order. I called ahead so we could pick up the food and take it home. When we got home, we were totally missing one meal--the tofu tacos. I called back and the order taker said I hadn't ordered the tacos, however both D and myself knew we had. There was supposed to be an itemized order list--not there. I'll admit that I should have checked the bag before I left, but so should they have. Now D is speaking to a manager. It boils down to I ordered it and she didn't hear it. We're out of an entire meal after paying $30. Walter, the manager, is giving D her tacos for free when she goes back. It's better than nothing, but..."}
{"text":"Loved the monk fish tacos with spicy avacado pasta salad. Good service and a great lunch."}
{"text":"First round of chips came by and they were stale asked the waitress for fresh chips she came back with two other baskets and they were worse. She said they fry them up every shift and in my mind it might have been last weeks shift. As an appetizer I ordered the queso and I should have gone to food lion for that one. It was a busy place and I wish everyone complained but my guess is people like stale chips or they just don't care."}
{"text":"This has quickly become a go-to restaurant for us and especially to bring out of town guests.  Service is great, food is great, beer selection is good.  It seems to ALWAYS be crowded, and with good reason, so plan ahead especially on Weekends."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and shrimp burrito with jalapeno and cheese mashers. The burrito was tasty even though I did not taste any shrimp. It was also filling, so I did good and only ate half.  Saved the other half for Monday's lunch.  The mashers were happily recommended by our server, yet they were lacking seasoning. Hats off to Cabo for my being able to tell they were homemade ( or in disguise)mashed potatoes.  Bf and I also tried Azula Rita margaritas. Margaritas range from $5 to $12 and are $1 off on Sundays. It consists of OJ, pineapple juice, Blue Curacao and Jose C. Pretty tasty and bf ordered a second. ;)  Service was just ok and there was a not big crowd. Will be back to try some of the other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during a vacation from NYC. EXCELLENT fish tacos--do NOT miss out on this place if you are anywhere hear the area, it was awesome."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Cabo for years now...before NoDa became the conglomerate that it is now.  The food is consistently good.  The flour tortillas that they use for their tacos are delicious all in their own.  I love the queso dip (the best I've had) and I've eaten at plenty mexican restaurants.  The Wraps are great and filling as are the entrees.  I will say that yes, at times, the chips are stale and the salsa isn't anything to write home about but who cares...it's an appetizer and it's free! I've never been impressed with their Margaritas so I usually stick w/Modelo or a Sweet Tea.   It is also a good place to take out-of-towners or maybe a first date.  It is usually VERY noisy so don't expect to have a super romantic time here unless you are a very laid back type of couple."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Cabo at Virginia Tech so I had to give this place a try when I came down to Charlotte. The ambiance in this place is almost identical, even down to the hipster-ish people working here who are always very kind. The salsa here wasn't as great as the one back at school but everything else was pretty much on par to the other location. We sat at the bar at this place was packed for a late lunch on Sunday. I enjoyed the chicken tacos which were spilling over of toppings but what I really come here for is the guacamole pasta salad. This place is always great!"}
{"text":"Advice: get yourself some tacos and a margarita, and skip the rest :) From a service perspective, I'd give it a \"good not great\"; there was a time or two when we wanted drink refills, and our waitress almost appeared to be avoiding our table, but otherwise she was friendly and attentive enough.  From a food perspective, I didn't really LOVE the Baja Shrimp & Crab dip (although my coworkers were into it, so who knows...maybe I'm crazy), and I've had better queso. They were fine, but I had a little of each and was over them.   If I were only rating the tacos and the margaritas, this place would have 4 stars. I had the special that day: talapia tacos that were covered in this delicious, spicy, buffalo-ish sauce and done to perfection...they were seriously yummy. And the Pomegranate margaritas were super delish...but then again, I think all of the margaritas are probably pretty good, from what my coworkers have told me. Definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"I had read the great reviews of this restaurant and, because I have a condo in Baja and love their fish tacos, I traveled cross town to it.  The location is great as it is in a great urban neighborhood called NoDa.  However I was greatly disappointed in the tacos.  Everyone raved about the tavaroo ones but pineapple on it just did not work for me  I also had the blackened mahi, which was better but the cilantro crema was too mild.  The salsa served with drinks was bland and dry with corn and tomatoes.  Garbanzos in the side dish??  I believe in creative cuisine but the food just was so far off from its Baja theme and was too bland for my taste.  Margarita menu interesting and varied with a great selection of tequilas.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my hubby at lunch time to check this place out. He had steak quesadilla and it was large and delicious. I had a 2 taco plate, 1 calamari & 1 crispy fish (you can mix & match!). Everything was brought out fresh and hot, quickly and with a smile. Our server paid us just the right amount of attention to make it a great experience. We will definitely be back to support this local gem :-)"}
{"text":"It's great but often VERY busy.   The fish tacos ARE indeed a tastebud treat. Yummy things I've tried include: Guacamole; CABO ROLL ; BBQ MAHI TACOS. And Margaritas. There are 13 kinds of Margaritas on the drink menu."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos ever!!! Awesome service. The inside is very nice! I'd come here every time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner after getting tattoo's at Fu's across the street. Ate here once before and really liked the food so we decided to go again.  The food was really tasty, Blackened Mahi Taco's with Avocado pasta and Battered Shrimp Taco's with rice. We all had NODA Jam Session draft beer and that was really good as well. We arrived 20 minutes before closing and we're told as we walked in to order quickly and we felt rushed by the staff and especially the waiter. When he brought our beer he told us if we wanted another it was last call, so we asked for one and he told us we had to drink the first before he could bring another - apparently state law.  OK, so why tell us it was last call.  No attention. No care in our food or service.  We'll go back but not within 30 minutes of closing.  We felt rushed and ignored!"}
{"text":"I was not in a rush to check out Cabo because many of my friends have given it really bad reviews. However, since I was in the neighborhood around lunch-time, I decided to stop in and give them a try.  I was by myself, so I just sat at the bar.  On my visit, I was very fortunate because the service was good and they had my order ready super-quick. (Probably because the owner was in the kitchen as one of the bartenders told me).  In any case, I decided to order the Tavarua Wahoo Tacos ($10.50). This consisted of blackened wahoo in a kiwi-pineapple fajita sauce, with lettuce, tomato, cheese, & a honey wasabi sauce.   The dish came with 2 tacos and your choice of a side dish.  The fish was perfectly cooked and had a nice balance of flavors. The tacos had a good amount of fish and tasted really good. I was a little worried that they might go overboard on the wasabi, but it was just the right amount.  For the side dish,  I went with the black beans & rice.  The side dish was ok, but the black beans could have used a little more seasoning.   The chips on my visit were fresh & crispy.  The salsa seemed to be made in house and had a nice flavor but was mostly corn and could have used a little more tomato and a little more heat.    Overall, I enjoyed my lunch and had good service, so I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went there last night with for the first time, and loved everything about it. Our server Melissa was very helpful, from navigating the beers on tap through the menu and specials. I had a BBQ Mahi Taco and a Lemon Grilled Shrimp Taco. Both were very tasty, but I was kicking myself for not getting two of the BBQ Mahi tacos. For a side item I got the spicy avocado pasta salad. Like the tacos, it was filled with flavor.   I look forward to going back. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The Good, the bad and the ugly.  Are you ready?  My waitress forgot my bloody mary, but she did bring me water.  Hey, thanks.  The chips were cold, cold like the bag was sitting outside.  The pico they serve with the chips had sad winter tomatoes and canned corn in it, also served refrigerator cold.  BRRRRRRR.  I ordered the special, wasabi shrimp burrito, it was not made with love. The flour tortilla was cold, it must be really cold in their kitchen.  The shrimp inside the burrito were good, if you took a shrimp bite it was warm but the burrito wasn't consistant, so some bites would be cold cheese and cold flour tortilla.  MMMMMMM, yum.  It is such a cute little place, maybe I will stick with drinking margaritas. As Homer Simpson would say, \"mmmmmmm. donuts/beer/erotic cakes.\""}
{"text":"Love the food. The Epic Burrito is awesome. Great selection of beers. I always order Birdsong Jalapeño Pale Ale to go with my meal. Kate, our waitress, spoils us. We always enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Awesome!  A great place to hang.  Had the tuna tacos love'd em!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place and I was dying to see what all the hype was about.  I came with some friends on a Saturday evening around 7pm, and let me just say BAD timing.  The place was packed and we had to wait almost an hour to get seated (there were 5 in our group).  There are 2 bars and we were able to grab beers and chat while we were waiting, but it was so packed there wasn't a whole lot of room for us even in the bar area.  After we were finally seated our food was served to us by a frustrated little man.  He seemed agitated and he wasn't very pleasant.  I had the signature tacos, one with beer battered white fish and the other was beer battered shrimp just to make sure I got my fill of fried goodness.  I ordered the jalapeno and cheese mashers (mashed potatoes topped with shredded cheese and chopped jalapenos from a jar) which I thought were pretty tasty.  My tacos were decent but seemed to be lacking flavor, maybe needed more sauce of some sort.  They seemed dry and I nearly choked on the lettuce and tortilla shell because it felt like eating paper.  Parking is extremely limited especially on a busy weekend night.  The prices are decent and they had a fairly good selection of beer on tap.  Overall this would be a great place to stop in for lunch but I definitely won't be back for dinner."}
{"text":"We love this place. The salsa is excellent, I prefer mine with extra corn and they can do that. I always get the Mahi burrito, love it. Sitting outside is our favorite, worth a little wait."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food and drinks I've had in Charlotte thus far. Their tacos are amazing and full of flavor. I had their beer battered tofu tacos. They were absolutely amazing! I'm currently salivating just thinking of them. The side of black beans and rice were delicious!   Drinks were fantastic: strong but sweet. Service was great, and atmosphere was fun and casual. I can't wait to go back over and over and over!"}
{"text":"I had my first fish taco when I was 18. That's way too long to live without knowing how great of an idea that is. Beer-battered fish has been a part of my life since the fish fries I went to as a kid, and taco night was always a DIY-adventure. So the two together can be pretty awesome. Or, like many things in NoDa, they can be trendy (and a bit pricey). Cabo Fish Taco's namesake is pretty good. They're not anything to sell my possessions for a surfboard over, but because I can't surf in Charlotte, I wouldn't do that anyway. I like the salsa blanca and how delicate yet filling these tacos are. Their queso takes a good hint of chipotle and is an excellent appetizer choice. Above all else, try the Mexi-Slaw, a chopped vegetable side that I like more than the traditional cole slaw. Since the place is trendy, one of the hot spots in NoDa, the way is long. Very long. It's relieving to be finally seated, but the place is so bumping that it's hard to really get anyone's attention. Once a server comes over, they're more than happy to help though. The scene's one thing, the food of the sea is another, and that's why I like Cabo Fish Taco but don't always want to go."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today. I've been trying to get there for 2 years and finally made it. One of the downfalls is the parking. If you can get past that your in for a good time. I had the BBQ Mahi tacos and I must say it was very tasty and the portion size was good. I also lucked up and had a great server so it was a good day."}
{"text":"I recieved my drink, appetizer and meal within 10min! Very good and fast service. Food was amazing, hot and fresh. The lemonade is fantastic"}
{"text":"Cool spot and the food is really good.  Often it can get crowed and they do not have space to wait, so often you're outside until a table opens, if the bar is crowded.  But as long as the weather is okay, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is really great. The nachos & corn salsa are excellent. Ordered Mahi-Mahi Taco, Chicken Taco & Spicy Avocado Pasta. The staff & the service is excellent. The location is close to the Charlotte downtown. Highly recommend eating here!!!"}
{"text":"YUM! Located in NoDa, parking can be a drag but if you're patient, you'll get a good spot. There are quite a few eating places in the area and it's just a great area of Charlotte to hang out.  The table salsa had just the right amount of heat. I love spicy so it didn't bother me one bit. But why did we order the crab dip? BEING GREEDY! It was so amazing...I mean, you want to fill up your bathtub and lather it all over your body AMAZING! And those pitas they serve with it...just order it and thank me later. I'd drive from the University City area just to have that dip.  I had one of the TAVARUA tacos and the Sweet Thai chili tofu taco. Loved them both, especially the tofu because it was crisp and yummy, I just wish there was more heat in the sauce, but that's just me. The tavarua taco was really good as well. I'm thinking they may have left the wasabi off of mine because I didn't taste it at all. Next time I'll be sure to ask for it on the side.  Our server was really very nice. We shall return."}
{"text":"3rd time in, it's a must stop every time we're in Charlotte.   The BBQ Mahi tacos are a must have.  A constantly changing specials menu, great craft beer selection with a few local brewerys on tap."}
{"text":"Great place to visit while in Charlotte. I saw it on \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" so figured we'd give it a try, great choice!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Blackened mahi tacos made me come back a second day in a row. Now that the blue line extension runs through Noda I'll be going a lot more."}
{"text":"I am SO happy we have Cabo Fish Taco here!  I'm a regular! My favorite is the signature 'Cabo FIsh Taco', which come 2 per entree.  Also, my side of choice is the 'jalapeño mashers' or when in season, the fresh fruit. I've also had the Tavarua Tuna Tacos & the BBQ Mahi Tacos & the grilled shrimp tacos. These are equally delicious! The chips & corn salsa are yummy too; however, sometimes the chips are soggy, so be careful of that, Margaritas, even the \"el cheapo' are very refreshing...& like the name says, \"cheap\"! :D"}
{"text":"Stopped in while visiting Charlotte. I live near Tampa and I've never had fish tacos as good as the BBQ Mahi Tacos. Just insane. They give you the option of corn or flour tortillas, I had the flour. The tortillas were slightly grilled or fried - they were in between soft and crunchy and they were fantastic. 2 tacos for about $11, but trust me, they are huge and filling. I can't recommend these tacos enough, and Cabo Fish Taco is on my must visit list from now on when I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Cabo Fish Taco last night. It was the second time we've eaten there in 2 months. The first time we fell in love. Last night, however, my husband got food poisoning. We will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, and they serve up free chips and salsa...how can you go wrong?  Cheap drink specials and very interesting décor.  It is a bit crowded inside, and loud...normally stuffed with hipsters too, but if you can see past al that...this place is a treasure chest."}
{"text":"I really like Cabo for the atmosphere, menu, beers.  The food is just A-OK it's pretty consistent and you can get some very good tacos but as far as food network worthy mmm not so much.  I will continue to come back to this little joint though waiting for it to wow me.  This is a great place to take some friends for lunch and try out some unique fish tacos.  It's always bumping so be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"You know, as much as Cabo lives in infamy for so many, I can't really see it through the same lens of \"amazement\" or \"culinary nirvana,\" but I can land on it being a solid choice...if the wait isn't too long. I've been coming here for years and even used to frequent the other location in Blacksburg, VA. Where's Cabo's menu isn't s strong point for my taste, it's a great spot for a few margs, decent fish tacos, and perfect for street-side seating in the summertime.   *Sigh*...the menu. Some of the items here just don't really push past the point of being worth the dollars. Believe me, the blackened tuna or mahi tacos are great. Love the slaw, the tortillas work well, they are piled high with goodies, and the flavors abound...but the rest of the plate? No thanks, brosef. The sides are ever-so lackluster. Jalapeno mashers? Ick. They never end up coming out right. Also, every time I've ordered a side of beans, I regret it. Also, for the veggie-lover, DON'T order the veggie burrito. The addition of zucchini and yellow squash inside the tortilla is an atrocity. But hey, if the sides are the worst part of their game, I think they are doing just fine for a NoDa staple.   Also, be prepared to wait on a Friday or Saturday night. The addition they have on the patio is awesome in the spring or summer. If you have a large group, you might end up with at least an hour wait on a busy night. I'm privy to heading here for lunch. Much more accessible.   Cabo, you are welcome in my book. I'm not a huge fan of your side items, but your space is killer and I'm a sucker for fish tacos. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Love it!  I visited Cabo Fish Taco a few years ago on my very first trip to Charlotte.  Since I enjoyed it so much then, I requested a repeat visit when I headed back to Charlotte last month.   I was not disappointed. I went all out with soup and an entree.  My soup was of the curry shrimp and chicken variety.  It was on the Specials board and sounded too interesting to pass up.  On a rare (I'm told) snowy night in Charlotte, this soup was the perfect way to start my meal.  Oh, accompanied of course with a delicious margarita, of course! For my main course I chose the mahi tacos with rice and beans.  It did not disppoint.  I was so full from the soup that I really didn't need to eat it all but I certainly did.   My co-diners were less than thrilled with their main entrees however one of them also thoroughly enjoyed the soup so it wasn't a total loss for them.  Overall the experiece was good for all and when they go back (sadly without me!) I am sure they will go back to their old favorites.   SInce I have been back, the restaurant has expanded and so combined with the snow, that meant that we did not have to wait for a table although that might not be the case on a normal Charlotte night.    Out of towners, I suggest you ask your hosts to take you there on your next visit!"}
{"text":"Second time at Cabo in Charlotte.  Food is pretty good; good selection of brews, not such a good selection of wines.  Most disappointing is that they did not have corn tortillas!  Not even the chips with the corn salsa were all corn.  One in our party is gluten sensitive and we were sure that choosing a mexican theme would be a sure bet for corn tortillas.  Guac was over smooth, but fairly tasty."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual mexican dinner this is a must-visit restaurant.  It is quite loud and can be tightly packed at peak dinner hours, but worth the experience.  Upon being seated, a bowl of chips and side of tomato-corn salsa will be brought to the table.  The salsa is good and different from the more traditional pureed type, but the chips are nothing special - cold, thick, and relatively tasteless.  I've only ever ordered the tacos here.  It's not stated on the menu, but you can combine any two tacos for the taco plates.  I chose the BBQ mango and Tavaru Wahoo tacos.  The BBQ mango is super saucy and flavorful, and the Tavaru has a stellar honey-wasabi sauce.  All of the entrees are served with a side and I chose the Nopalio salad, which was a cold mix of black beans/cactus/spices.  I've also had the mexi-slaw in previous visits and was pleased with its very light dressing and topping with sunflower seeds.  In addition to great tasting fresh food and generous portions, the prices can't be beat.  $10 will buy you two very large tacos (seriously the most stuffed tacos I've ever had) and a side.  This is definitely not the restaurant where you leave hungry.  Several \"double decker\" cake slices were listed as daily specials, but I was too full to partake."}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco, in general, is a decent establishment. Although I have conflicting opinions on various food choices offered, the restaurant atmosphere usually makes up for any setback.   First off, the fish tacos... very well crafted. If you're a fan of fish tacos, you really can't go wrong with these. I've been out to this place about three times now and have come to realize it's a safe bet. My favorite (although I really haven't tried any others) is the Wasabi Fish Taco, which as you may have figured, has that perfect combination of sweet and spicy flavor. In my opinion, it is still on the mild side.  Now contrary to the fish tacos, are their burritos. Fail. These are basically meals you could easily put together yourself- wrap, a can of re-fried beans, mixed with some other ingredients that just don't make up for the overpowering sense of eating at a Taco Bell. Not that there is anything wrong with Taco Bell, but simply put, you are basically paying Cabo $10.29 for a near synonymous $.99 bean burrito from Taco Bell. And burrito size? Probably less than half of what you'd expect an authentic Mexican restaurant to serve you.   Lastly, atmosphere. The restaurant has a great layout and usually has a great crowd. Well decorated. The ambient noise can be a little much at times with the acoustics set up as such- a lot of hard wood, metal, etc.  Overall, I would REALLY rate a 3.5 if could. Ideally, if all your looking for is a place to go to have a few drinks with friends, get some food (knowing you want a fish taco, of course), this place is definitely worthy of your time."}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego, I'd have to give their tacos and A-OK. The vibe is great and the salsa definitely needs improvement. I would recommend this restaurant but I think they can go from good to great with some revamped salsa and perhaps a quick trip to SouthBeach restaurant in San Diego. Then, they can nail it."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today at the suggestion of Guy Fieri DDD....  I had the waiter suggested salmon honey wasabi taco and the Fieri recommendation, bbq mahi taco with the slaw.   I would come back for the salmon wasabi tacos any day!  I was not as impressed with the bbq mahi taco. They had a strange flavor combination going on.  My husband got the carne asada tacos ... He loved them but I just thought they were ok. Not impressed...but I am from Southern California and no one can beat SoCal carne asada street tacos!!!    But let's get back to the salmon honey wasabi tacos!.....yummo!!!  Jeremy our server was great!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and Brittany said to try  the sushi tuna tartar taco. OMG!!!  Easily the best fish taco I have ever had. Pleas add this to the regular menu."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Had a Serrano chicken salad that was superb. The skinny margarita was marginal.  The rest of our dinner party raved about their tacos and burritos. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco is one of the most hoppin' restaurants in Charlotte and for good reason:  tasty fresh Cali-Mex (or Baja) food, cool ambience, fresh salsa, and its proximity to all the hightlife joints in NoDa.  However, the place is somewhat \"tainted\" by their reputation.  I've never been when it wasn't packed and the servers weren't rushing us to order.  Dont' get me wrong-I still highly recommend that people try Cabo.  Just try it out for lunch or whenever the gallery crawls in NoDa are not taking place.  I've had the taco salad with chicken and on another occasion, carne asada tacos-both of which were slammin'!  The carne asada tacos uses chunks of well seasoned meat-with onion, cilantro, and romaine lettuce.  I was exceedingly full after eating just two of them.  The salad screamed freshness as well; chunks of real chicken, romaine lettuce, and other fresh veggies and cheeses.  Mmm mmm!    if you dare go on a weekend night, please be gracious to the wait staff.  They work pretty hard and brought our food in a timely fashion despite the crowds.  If I could offer any suggestions to Cabo, I would tell them hire more wait staff for the weekends.  The service doesn't quite match the quality of food.  Perhaps they could open up the upstairs for dining as well.  Overall, I'm pleased to have a restaurant like this in CLT."}
{"text":"When I first came here I really enjoyed it but my last 2 visits were really underwhelming. The salsa is pretty average, nothing to write home about. I have only had their burritos and fish tacos but the ingredients and flavors don't WOW me. It's just another Ok taco spot."}
{"text":"Love, love, love CFT.  It's often crowded but I think it adds to the atmosphere.  The waitstaff are relaxed and funny but efficient, and the food is awesome!  I'm not a fish or seafood eater but can always find something on the menu that makes me lick my chops."}
{"text":"I really loved it! I found Cabo to be super vegetarian friendly, even though I chose to eat cheese quesadillas like a child, and will totally be back for more! The chips and queso were great and the Margaritas were as well! Great place for dinner with friends before seeing a show at Neighborhood Theater."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining at the great Cabo Fish Taco.  Ordered the Rasta Pasta, it was simply fantastic.  This has to be one of the best pasta's in the Charlotte area! IT has generous helpings of chicken, shrimp, pineapples, bell peppers, etc.  SEX for my TASTE buds, that's all I can say about the Rasta Pasta.   -The crab dip was awesome, as always.  The pita bread it was served with, was warm and soft.    Service was great.  Tunes were great.  Ambiance was great.  The Sex my taste buds had was great.  Everything was Great!!  GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!"}
{"text":"We've been three times and ordered something different each time and every one was wonderful!!! We've split because the dishes are so large. Plus, we order a queso and mix it with the corn salsa for a delicious combo. The first time we got buffalo chicken tacos (the daily special), second we ordered a Baja bowl (I think the name of it) filled with shrimp and the third the Rasta pasta. They even split the Rasta pasta into two separate bowls for us which was a nice touch. But if you're looking for a quiet dinner this is not the place to go and parking is also a pain. Nonetheless, this restaurant is like no other, the best food in QC."}
{"text":"Love this place best fish tacos on the planet and service here 1 to 10 is a 20 I live in Charleston and I it this place everytime I'm in town ..."}
{"text":"We've been to Cabo Fish Taco several times. It's usually ok. Not terrible food, but surely nothing spectacular either.   (disclaimer: my first fish tacos were eaten in Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico...most wonderful thing ever.)  We went with a group, 6 in all, on Saturday. We arrived about 2:20. Sat, ordered drinks and crab dip. Enjoyed drinks and crab dip, and ordered food, only 5 of us ordered food, all tacos.  then we waited...and waited  .......and waited  ....................still waited.  About an hour after we ordered the waitress said our food would be ready soon.  30 minutes later we asked her again.  It was ANOTHER FULL 30 MINUTES before food arrived, cold and awful.  They said that their computer system was broken, but somehow they were able to fill every other table's order. We saw others seated, fed, and gone.  And the food...cold, how do you cook something at the last minute, but deliver it cold? Our mashed potatoes wouldn't even melt the cheese. The tacos were just...just...there aren't words for how much it sucked.  We were in the restaurant until 5:00. Now, I'm all for leisurely eating...but not for this.  They did discount our food, but that wasn't the point really. We would have been more than happy to pay full price for a decent edible meal."}
{"text":"I thought Cabo Fish Taco was excellent. It had a great atmosphere, the service was excellent- and above all the food was incredible. I got the fish tacos, which were very good. It came with huge chunks of fish, and all of the other ingredients were fresh and delicious. The corn salsa they put out for the table was great!    I had a couple of drinks. One was a specialty margarita, the other was a NoDa Jam session, which is some sort of local beer. Neither drink was very good, at least based on how the server described them. I would probably not drink here in the future, and leave that to one of the many local bars within walking distance.   Definitely recommend if you want something a little different. We went with a large party and everyone seemed very satisfied. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"By far the best tacos i've ever had! Everything is bursting with flavor and the service here is really great! There are so many options on the menu, all of which sound super good. Our server was super attentive and made sure we were all happy. The prices are also pretty good. A must come!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Flavors were terrific and the service was pretty good. It took a while for them to seat us even though we had reservations."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm from San Diego. I love everything Mexican and Fish Tacos are a must. Unfortunately, I've found this place to be more trendy than good. When I received my fish tacos they looked like what I expected except for one thing. If the fish was breaded at the restaurant then why bother breading fish pieces. The fish itself was fine but I received pieces. Typically, if you cut the fish correctly you won't have pieces. The batter was okay but I've fish sticks for Gorton's that were better. The batter had absolutely no flavor. It just seemed that someone took the time to decorate but I felt that I was served leftovers. I'm going to look somewhere else for fish tacos in the future.  If you ever in San Diego then try Rubio's, which is a fast food fish taco place and they seem to know what to serve the customer and what not to serve the customer. Cabo's didn't feel that way. At I could have received the same dinner for half the price but with a lot more flavor."}
{"text":"NOT a good experience..... I'll leave it at that. Something has changed since the triple D visit or Spike would have  walked away shaking his head ?"}
{"text":"Excellent! The bbq Mahi Mahi tacos were delicious! They were probably the BEST fish tacos I've ever had. The service was good and our food came out in a timely manner. I would definitely come back if I'm in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"This place is very enjoyable. I ordered the Veggie Burrito with the Azula Rita and I enjoyed both very much. The veggie burrito was well seasoned and filling, my drink was good too. The only thing that disappointed me was when I asked for a straw for my drink, the server told me they are not giving out straws. I have sensitive teeth and asked for a paper straw for my drink md she never returned to tell me if they had paper straws or not. I would eat here again, I would bring my own straw, I would eat there again."}
{"text":"I am not exaggerating when I said this was the best tacos I have ever had. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because its a really casual restaurant so the atmosphere isn't five star. But more importantly- the food! The salsa was great but the tacos!!! The drinks were big/strong & tasty. Literally everything you need in a Mexican restaurant in the coolest neighborhood- definitely have to check this place out! App: $5 Entree: $12 Large cocktail: $10 Total w/ tip $35"}
{"text":"There were five of us and everyone loved their meal! Two had the Baja Bowls w/salmon that was amazing!!!  Some of us had the special grouper tacos and shrimp tacos and carne asada tacos. All of them were so tasty! We also had the guac with chips and was awesome!"}
{"text":"Although the name implies delicious fish options, my sister and I got chicken tacos and carne Asada tacos. Both were lacking flavor, the chicken was worse than the carne Asada. Refried beans were bland, the avocado pasta salad was warm and weird, also not much flavor. The queso was delicious, but the chips were thick, yellow, and cold. Just not my favorite style of chips. The corn salsa they serve with their chips was also very bland. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We live in the Ballantyne area.  Please open a restaurant over here.  I will drive to Noda for your cool wonderful experience where the fish taco's are the best ever. I also enjoy the whole Nada experience as well.  My daughter actually went to your restaurant first and now love to go there to have a great afternoon of shopping and fish taco's !!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I've been here several times and reason being? Food Network of course...so I got the BBQ Mahi Tacos as always and they were delicious! I love the crunchy slaw with the tender Mahi Mahi and the white cilantro sauce.   Service was ok (that's why I took off a star). Our waitress was flustered even though it wasn't that busy. She forgot to bring more chips & salsa after being asked an excessive three (3) times. Not to mention the station to get the chips & salsa was right beside our table; So we repeatedly saw her walk past it but we still didn't get it until asking the 4th time. She also took a while to bring our beers and we could see the bar from where we were sitting.  Also, the hostess @ the door had a mild \"stank-a**\" demeanor that I didn't appreciate. O_o"}
{"text":"i am a mexican food maniac, so this restaurant with a catchy name and just 5 minutes from home, immediately moves up my favorite places to stop list and who doesn't LOVE the skull and crossbones artwork on the patio right now?!  i stopped in with a friend for lunch yesterday around 1pm, we indulged in the corn salsa and chips & an order of the guacamole (all of average quality, but i am a sucker for a starch dipped in avocado mush, yum!) i proceeded with one of my favorites the carne asada tacos sans cheese with a side of mexi-slaw and it did not disappoint.    everything on the menu is fairly priced, the specials are always an option worth exploring and the mexican beers available make me happy :)   only issue i had yesterday were some hiccups in the service, while seated immediately we waited awhile for our waters, waited even longer for our tacos and then again for refills and the check..but it was A-OK and i will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This could just be the best restaurant in Charlotte.  Most delicious beer battered shrimp taco that I've found anywhere.  Lunch and weekends can be busy.  Charles and Delphine at the bar are friendly and super-efficient.   I'm hooked on their shrimp tacos and fish tacos, but recently discoovered their incredible spicy avacado pasta salad.  Keep coming back cuz I can't believe how yummy the food is."}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco never dissappoints!  Several of my coworkers are in LOVE with Cabo Fish Taco, so I go there every 6-8 weeks for work-related lunches. The service is usually very prompt and there is typically no problem getting a table during the lunch rush.   I love the salsa, and have tried virtually everything on the menu and have never had a bad meal!  I've also been to Cabo for brunch and dinner. Our brunch experiences have been delightful and, if memory serves me correctly, I had a stellar bloody mary the last time I went there for lunch.  My only beef with Cabo Fish Taco is that they don't take reservations for dinner (or at least they didn't the few times I've called), I sincerely hope they'll reconsider because I would love to add the restaurant to our repertoire of locations to go for birthday celebrations and/or to bring out of town guests but I don't like to wait in line for 45+ minutes for a table.   Cabo Fish Taco serves top notch food, and provides excellent service. I'll continue to eat there regularly and, if I find out they've started accepting reservations, I'll up my rating to five stars!!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The fish always tastes fresh, the daily special tacos are always worth trying. The BBQ Mahi taco is a must try when you come here for the first time. Try to come for an early dinner or late lunch because this place gets packed real quick on weekends."}
{"text":"I'm probably going to make some enemies in Charlotte by not eating this place higher but despite its devoted following, Cabo Fish Taco is overrated and overpriced. I've also noticed that the quality has been steadily declining over a he years. I used to really like it but now it's squarely in 'just ok' territory with me.   Some of the tacos are good but some are of iffy quality. The crane asada tacos used to be my go to but last time I had then, the meat was incredibly tough. They're seasoned well but that doesn't matter much when the meat is the consistency of a shoe. The tuna isn't fresh tasting so I'd avoid that too. The fried fish tacos and the Mahi tacos are decent.  One of my biggest complaints about this place is the unreasonable prices. Not only are the tacos way overpriced but they also charge five bucks for the tomatillo salsa then don't give refills! The house salsa is free but it's disgusting. I love the tomatillo salsa but I use a lot of salsa and I don't expect to pay ten dollars for salsa alone!  The atmosphere of this place is really fun but the food quality just doesn't measure up to the price tag or the ridiculously long waits. I guess in Noda, you can get away with skewed price to quality ratios since the twenty year old hipsters will flock to you regardless!"}
{"text":"Get the Tarvaroo tuna tacos and the Baja shrimp n crab dip. Best tacos I've ever eatin!"}
{"text":"As a Virginia Tech grad I am a little biased(Blacksburg also has a Cabo Fish Taco). That being said, I have honestly been to Cabo Fish Tacos over 30 times and I have tried almost every item on the menus. I would definitely recommend mix and matching two tacos and pairing it with a margarita.   Maybe it's the nostalgia of the Blacksburg location but I feel like the food quality, location, service, and overall atmosphere is better than the NODA location. I'd still recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"I've been here before.. several times in fact, and the food has always been.. Ok.  Don't misunderstand, I read the other yelp reviews, I've seen that people love Cabo Fish Taco and I WANTED to love this place, I just didn't think it was anything special, passable sure, maybe even \"good\" but certainly not worth the 30 minute drive, it was just nothing special.  Until today.  We had a rare lunch w/o kids so were up for something a lil different.  Decided to try Jack Beagles as I'd heard good things but had never been.  As we pulled up we saw Cabo just next door and thought.. Better the devil you know, right?  So Cabo was the answer.  Got talking to our waiter (also the bartender as our table was next to the bar) and I mentioned that as much as I'd wanted to love Cabo, so far I'd been greatly underwhelmed and I asked for suggestions.  Immediately he suggested the Tavarua Tuna tacos.. And I regretted asking lol.  See, I don't do meat/fish with fruit.  Of any kind, ever.  I greatly dislike sweet and sour food combos, I don't like sweet elements in a savory dish.  Tavarua Taco has all of these elements - blackened, lemon rubbed wahoo (blackened=strike 1 for me) in a kiwi-pineapple marinade (strike 2) with a honey-wasabi sauce (definite strike 3 for me).  Grudgingly I ordered a Tavarua Taco along with my Carne Asada taco figuring at least I knew the steak would be ok as I've had it in the past.  In a word, WOW.  I started with the Tavarua Tuna and honestly, I'm not sure I've ever eaten anything tastier.  WOW.  I now know fully why people RAVE about this place.. If you've been unimpressed, I promise you're ordering wrong!  The GM came past our table to ask how we were enjoying our meal and I told him how..bland our past experiences were (I've always had either the carne Asada tacos or the beer battered fish tacos - and he agreed with me that it is fairly easy to get a better beer battered fish taco elsewhere, but that's not what they're about and often people are disappointed thinking the fried fish taco is a \"signature\" dish, when the reality is the fresh grilled fish and all the clean flavors are the star of the show.  Genuinely, I could eat there everyday - the Tuna was SO good that the Carne Asada taco afterwards felt like punishment, and I ended up leaving it and the side (spicy avocado pasta salad - tasty!) in favor of ordering and having the room to eat a second Tavarua taco.  Unbelievable yum.  We will be back.  We will be back often.  I will be getting the Tavarua tacos, you can bet on it :)"}
{"text":"Just had lunch today at Cabo FIsh Taco.  I had the wasabi tuna wrap.  There is only one word to describe the dish:  WOW!  It had to have been one of the of the best fish dishes I have ever eaten.  The portion was huge- I had to take half of it home along with most of the rice and beans. The service and ambience were awesome.  So why only four stars and not five stars?  I had a microbrew.  A pint cost $6.50- or over half the cost of the main dish.  While it was good, I will stick with Diet Coke next time.  But rest assured, I will return!"}
{"text":"Somehow I walked in on a busy Friday night without having to wait.  What I ordered:  Caborita margarita - delicious.  Queso fresco - too much queso  White fish tacos - just meh, the fish just had a fried taste  I had remembered having awesome fish tacos - apparently it wasn't here."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my calamari taco. It had just the right amount of flavor and it was a nice break from more traditional seafood or Mexican. I'd probably go back next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people who are obsessed with this place, I personally don't understand why.  The tacos are basic and the guacamole comes out of a bag.  I complained about it because I am obsessed with guac and my waiter even admitted they buy it premade because \"they don't have time to make it\".  Half of the point in going ot a mexican restaurant is for the good guac, so that turned me off right away.  This place is not worth the extremely long wait times.  I would only go back for the environment, not the food."}
{"text":"Welp...Cabo Fish Taco fails again. As I stated in my first review quite a while ago, the service is total garbage. It was so loud in the restaurant I could hardly have a conversation at my table, and the waitress was barely audible.  I ordered the chicken and shrimp burrito again, and this time it actually came out correctly. BUT! We also ordered a salmon baja bowl and not to my surprise it came out with shrimp on it. I don't know where the gap in communication is with this restaurant. It may be the volume of music that is so loud the wait staff can't hear the order, or may the chefs can't read. Both times I have gone they have given me the wrong food. It's a shame the service is so poor because the food is delicious. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Not sure you can be a taco lover in Charlotte without trying this place. I have been coming here for years and they never disappoint. I must admit I have not ventured too much away from tacos on the menu, but that's a good thing. They do tacos so well, I've tried them all and love them. The Mahi and tuna are my favorite. It can be a little costly, however I have never left here still hungry. Keep in mind this place can get packed so on a weekend night you'll probably have a wait. However, they use the service that can let you see where you are at in line and alert you when your table is ready. We like to use that time and have drinks or an appetizer next door at sabor."}
{"text":"Most amazingly delicious place to eat! Friendly service. One of our favorite go to places when we visit the Charlotte area. I got their chicken quesadea and it was perfect! Servings are generous and prices reasonable! You may have a wait at this place but we'll worth it! Love to eat here!  This is a gotta try for anyone who visits or lives in Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"Went last night based on reviews. Crowded and loud. Didn't like the corn salsa at all. Chips tasted stale or overcooked. Got the queso. It was decent. The tuna taco was awesome. The advocado pasta was ok. I like spicy, but jalapeño was almost all I could taste. The Noda Jam Session was good. My daughters Mahi Burrito was no bueno. She only took a few bites. We are from Florida and used to eating fresh fish. She said it didn't taste fresh or it was not a good flavor combo.  Our waiter left us sitting for a while with the bill waiting to pay. He was sitting on his phone st the bar. I finally walked the check up to him. Probably won't be back. Wish we had picked somewhere else to eat on our one night in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit this place while visiting from South FL. Great little spot. Lots of hustle and bustle on Saturday at 2pm, but service was great and the lemon tuna tacos were even better."}
{"text":"The good reviews must be fake. The food here is terrible! Very disappointed because we had been looking forward to trying this place for a while. But, do yourself a favor and skip it. NOT authentic and the food was cold--the tacos were obviously straight from the refrigerator and the mashed potato side was definitely from a box. The chips were also stale. And, as a kicker, a number of people from our group felt sick afterward. Avoid this place and pick one of so many better taco places:  Bakersfield or Sabor, just to name two."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to come for a long time. 5 stars for atmosphere. 3 stars for food. 1 Star for parking. Had fish tacos, shrimp tacos, beef burrito, Ava pasta salad..... everything very bland and under seasoned. All fine but very very underwhelming. Will not be venturing back. Parking is terrible so just not worth the trip. We are from Huntersville and Verde has hands down superior food."}
{"text":"The best!  I mean the best by far tacos made in a variety of ways for you to enjoy.  I must say that the Honey Soy Glazed Salmon Taco is the BEST!!!!  Well  my personal preference anyway!  You must come and enjoy for yourself!! The drinks are good,  the atmosphere is amazing, and Michelle's service we too notch!  She is the server that will offer you suggestions, give her your opinion and you make a decision, but trust me, her suggestions are on point.  You have a great lady working for your establishment and she's friendly to boot!  You don't get friendly everywhere, but ask for Michelle and she's got ya!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure if we ordered the wrong things, but the food was just okay. I had ordered the salmon salad and the fish was raw inside...I told my server and she kindly brought me out another one, but by that time my appetite was non existent."}
{"text":"Great food, great queso, and the atmosphere is cool. A must do in the NODA area."}
{"text":"BEST fish tacos in Charlotte.  I've tried many fish tacos in the area, and I'm always led back to Cabo.  I've tried all varieties, Mahi-Mahi, Salmon, Beer battered etc....all are excellent with exception of the beer battered whitefish tacos.  They are bland, but are supposed to be the \"signature tacos.\"  Sides:  Stick with black beans and rice.  They are a safe choice.  Only complaints:  Lack of \"specials.\"  Occasionally they have $1 off margaritas, but their sandwich board of daily deals only ever include \"featured items\" and offer no real price break or discount.   Love the outside seating in the summer, but the inside seating is rather loud, and it is hard to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"Awesome, hot, fresh, delicious!    Went to try this place win my wife for lunch.  I was blown away with how great the service was.  We were seated quickly, the waiter was great, and the food was decadent!    Can't wait for my next visit!!!"}
{"text":"margs and shrimp tacos are all you need!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! In the NODA area of Charlotte, not too far from UNCC. We went for a late lunch on a Wednesday, and there were plenty of tables available after 1:30 or so. I had blackened mahi-mahi tacos and baja rice (with a pineapple chutney), and oh man was it good! My wife has to eat gluten-free, and our waiter was very helpful (and friendly)... she ended up with a huge pile of food... basically a chicken baja bowl without the bowl.   I hope we get back there next time we're in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great food and experience. Always busy. But worth the wait. When you put your name down on the waiting list they will take your phone number and text you when your table is ready.  This allows you to walk around Noda and grab a drink at another bar while you wait. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Saw this place on \"DDD\" had to try!! The Tacos were excellent.  Our service was great.  My margarita was perfect.  So even if your not hungry the drinks are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Always one of our favorite date places. Honey soy salmon and bbq mahimahi are on point! Seasonal jalapeño cheddar mashed potatoes were good, I would rather have fresh jalapeños over pickled, but still good."}
{"text":"This place is more so simply another chain not too authentic if you ask me. I prefer authentic Mexican food when I actually take the time to sit down or else I could've just went to chipotle or moe's. I remembered I hadn't been here in a while when in the area and now I remember why that is. I ordered a shrimp quesadilla which was extremely bland and I maybe took two bites before i stopped trying to force myself. It looked amazing but the taste did not match that all if anything all i tasted was cheese. Of course the table came with chips and corn salsa, but the corn salsa was absolutely disgusting(there was really nothing salsa about it). Our server was sweet which really helped out with our experience but I honestly don't see myself returning anytime soon maybe in another 5 years"}
{"text":"Goodness Gracious!!!! let me tell you what! This place is de frickin licious! I had the bbq mahi mahi and the tuna the Tavarue one with the honey wasabi sauce that I'm pretty sure could make a shit sandwich taste good! I can't wait to go back! The service was excellent as well! Sunday at 11 with no wait and food within 10 minutes! Make a bulldog break his chain bo!"}
{"text":"We didn't wait at all to be seated, and our host was very friendly and nice.  Our waiter however could have cared less about us.  Our food was luke warm. I the carne asada taco that left a bad taste in my mouth and the rice that came with black beans reminded bland Uncle Ben's rice."}
{"text":"We swung by yesterday (for lunch). Had a great server named Casey. Super fast, funny and quick with the refills. The food was so great. We left happy and full."}
{"text":"Very good!  Tacos are huge but insanely tasty. Each order comes with two. However, two are plenty. The salsa n chips are also great.  On Thursdays all NC drafts are half off which is a plus.  I don't usually get surprised by taco spots but this place is solid!"}
{"text":"Good food, good vibe. Visiting from PA and I have to say, next time I'm here I'm definitely coming here"}
{"text":"Hipster style Taco joint with a bar inside. Drinks are bland as well as the basic flavored tacos. Specialty tacos got flavor but could do better to have little more flavor like something was missing. Price ranges about $10-15 depending on what you get. Don't believe the hype. But if willing to give a chance then select a specialty taco. The sides that come with the tacos are NOT good. Food came out really fast. Overpriced"}
{"text":"This place has four stars, and that nails it on the head. It's not worse, and it's not better. The location is excellent, I LOVE Noda. The service was nice as well.  I am not a fish taco type of person, so that is somewhat important to my review. But, I am a food person, and flavors are a big part of what makes me decide if I LOVE something. I had two tacos, a steak taco, and a salmon taco. The salmon taco had a sauce that used horseradish as the main flavor, likely a good match for seafood. This taste, however, turns me off in general, making the taco get overpowered. The steak tacos was good, the steak a bit chewier than I would like, especially after the Carne Asada Fries from Sabor next door.  I'm sure that if I loved fish tacos, this would be my place!"}
{"text":"I love fish tacos, and after reading all the blah yelp reviews, I was worried about this place. Turns out--nothing to worry about. This place is great! One thing I did take from the reviews was to stay away from CFT's standard fried fish taco. Instead, I went for the grilled mahi mahi taco, which was very good.  Also tasty was the Mexican slaw with pumpkin seeds that our friendly waitress recommended.   A big thumbs up for the decor, too. CFT is located in an old renovated building with brick walls and old wooden floors that is festively lit and full of warm bright colors. I really thought the design elements of the space added to the experience.   Sure, it is not exactly Ocean Beach San Diego, but it is pretty darn close and a really fun atmosphere with great service. It is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Amazing shrimp and blackened mahi tacos, delicious unique beers on tap, fantastic service; definitely worth the 15 min wait."}
{"text":"I am a fan of hanging out in NoDa and I have loads of friends who LOVE this place. I however just didn't find it to be anything extraordinary.  There's nothing really to say oh this was awful, or this was unacceptable. It just came across so bland. The decor has got a NoDa feel which is good but again nothing to make it stand out. The wait for this place is outrageous which really leads me to a conclusion that it's very overrated. I will have to go back and give it another shot but for now I will stick with 3 stars. I hate that I can't really give a better review but the whole experience just left me underwhelmed and was not very memorable."}
{"text":"Guac is soooo creamy coool ! Great experience and funky vibe. Loved the music and decor. Waiters were fun and totally seemed like surfer dudes, like totally dude. The food was delish and sooo good. The salsa was so flavorful, it honestly tasted like they just prepared it before they brought it to the table. The chips were perfectly salted and so crispie and crunchie! Sooo good.  My 2 year old nephew was with us this day and he loved the food and also the MUSIC! He was partying and jamming out to some reggae songs while we ate. Got some cute videos of him. Soooo...if your 2 year old nephew is smiling and jaming out and snacking on chips, salsa, fish tacos and the alike, this place has got to be good!  4 adults, 1 child, and bill was around 60 bucks or so. Not terrible. We were stuffed and by the time we went to leave -- the entire place was packed and there was a line at the door!  This is saying something for a Sunday at 12 noon !  Check this place out - you will be glad you did! Oh yummm dude!"}
{"text":"Started with chips and salsa. The chips were very stale and super salty. Salsa was ok. Tried the Cabo role as a starter that was average. The tacos were very good, tried the tavarua tuna tacos which were great. Atmosphere very casual which is a plus since we were just grabbing a late lunch."}
{"text":"Got tacos to go! World class tuna taco! Avocado pasta salad as a side was heavenly. We definitely be a return customer."}
{"text":"Tacos are pretty much a staple in my diet! While visiting Charlotte for a weekend, we stopped here for lunch. I ordered the blackened salmon taco and the lemon shrimp taco (love that you can mix and match entrees). My friend lives in Charlotte and had nothing but great things to say about the salmon tacos, so I went for it! They were great, seasoning was perfect. I was better off getting two of these instead of the shrimp taco but it was good. The special sauce and pickled veggies on top of the tacos are also worth mentioning! Nothing was too spicy or overwhelming either.   Other things to mention is that their salsa is jam packed with corn, so don't expect the regular salsa here. It's good, just different! The decor of this place is really cool too.   5 stars for the customer service."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Charlotte, I demand that my husband take me to Cabo Fish Taco so that I can get the Tuna Tavarua tacos. The honey wasabi sauce and the marinated tuna is out of this world.  The avocado pasta salad is unique and goes perfectly with the the tacos. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Cabo, I am exponentially satisfied with my decision to have done so. Their food is exquisite, and I would gladly eat anything covered in their wasabi sauce. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"They are flavor scientists... Adventurous ingredients on each unique taco. Great place for a local beer and refreshing meal. Only downfall... When the bill comes. Pricey."}
{"text":"Cabo was my first Love in NoDa. I have been many, many times but always get the same thing. The Tavaroo tacos with the pasta salad. It's the best thing on the menu and never misses!"}
{"text":"I try fish tacos everywhere I go.  The Tavares Wahoo tacos might be the best I have ever had anywhere.  Great spice and flavor and they do not skimp on the fish like a lot of places.  Good beer selection and awesome corn salsa.  Cool neighborhood and atmosphere.  Limited but nice patio seating.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The wait was 10 minutes but they sent us a text when our table was ready. So we went shopping in the boutiques across the street. Unless you sit outside, its impossible to have a conversation with out yelling. They have a good selection of local beer and about a dozen margaritas.  We ordered the beer batter fish tacos- they were big and filled with yummy but very greasy fish.  ( next time Im going to try something grilled) ). It came with 2 sides- i had black beans and rice- both perfectly seasoned.  Our server was super nice and well be back!"}
{"text":"Cabo fish taco is the best restaurant in NODA. We go here probably once a month and the food has never disappointed. They bring out a basket of corn/tomato salsa and chips for everyone. It is a bit difficult to eat but I love the corn in this. My favorite restaurant salsa! The grilled Serrano chicken tacos are my go-to. Last time I went they were so big I couldn't even finish them. The white sauce is the best, I always order an extra side of it. The mashers (mashed potatoes) are great. They are obviously made from scratch and are some of the best I've ever had. The El Cheapo is a great basic margarita. Highly recommend Cabo, great value and great food!"}
{"text":"My first ever fish taco, and it blew my mind.   First walking in, I thought the atmosphere was meh (too loud) and the service was also meh (too slow). The salsa was pretty good but nothing unlike the salsas I've had before.   But then my BBQ Mahi Tuna Taco came and I almost died and went to heaven. I was expecting fish tasting taco but it was the least fish tasting tuna I've ever had. The fish was cut into chunky cubes but cooked so the meat practically melted into your mouth. The best part was the tortilla.  The tortilla was made out of some sort of God-Bread that was both flaky and bready at the same time. It was almost pastry like and I need to know how to make it!   But anyways. You get my drift. Awesome, awesome, awesome food."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good taco?! They have so many options, and they aren't just good for the tacos either. (The wraps are worth a try)  They deliver you chips with a house made salsa( corn as the base), complimentary.   Every-time I go I try to explore the menu and get something different, and My palate has yet ti be deceived!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte! The epic tuna burrito has truly changed my life. I take every person that visits from out of town here to try it. They have a lovely patio that they can close when its cold. The Bloody Marys are some of the best I have ever had. They change up the taco specials daily and the taco shells are amazing! I love that you can choose a specialty taco and substitute any meat, for example if it comes with tofu and you want chicken they will do that for you. I could ramble for days about how much I love this place and I wish I could give them more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"What a happenin' hipster spot. The restaurant doors are wide open for half in/half out seating.  We sat at the bar for faster serving. We ordered their unique fish tacos and some margaritas.  I cannot tell you how TASTY and YUMMY this food was!!  It's kind of messy, so it's not for eating on your first date! Parking sucks, though.  You gotta park a ways away, as the NODA district is usually pretty crowded at night. The staff were very nice and accommodating.  The seating arrangement is tight and not the best design for large groups. They do have two bars, so go to one of those and eat if they're on a wait."}
{"text":"What happened?   I have always loved CFT and willing to suffer the long waits.   Last night...no wait!   This should have been a red flag.    Did they change chefs?   My halibut fish taco was just \"OK\".   Where was the signature sauce?  The slaw on the taco tasted like a premade packaged slaw.   The cheese was cold.  The waitress was super nice and the food came out quickly.   But it didn't make up for the so-so tacos.    My daughter had the fajitas which had way too much soy sauce, very salty.  So sad.   I will think twice about going back and am now looking for another source for my fish tacos."}
{"text":"Best eats in NODA! Service is 10 stars. Consistency and great food puts this restaurant above the competition."}
{"text":"Food was just average, way over hyped. Cool area of town, but it ends there. Service was good and beer was cold."}
{"text":"This place really went down hill. The atmosphere is cool but that's about it. The food just doesn't seem fresh and it lacks flavor. It's surprising because the food used to be very good but the past 4 or 5 times has been just bad. Service has never been good but we never expected it in this place."}
{"text":"Best place in noda! Fish tacos are on point and the margaritas are made to perfection. Over been there a few times- ok maybe like 50- and the staff seems nice and the food if awesome."}
{"text":"Tacos are good! I got the blackened mahi mahi tacos and they have the most flavor of anything on the menu. But I feel like the freshness flavor has gone down over the past few years. Especially the tomatoes. Rice and beans are the pretty average. Kind of under seasoned in my opinion. Chips and corn-tomato salsa are kind of bland as well. Jalapeño mashed potatoes are good but I don't feel like they pair great with tacos. Cute atmosphere and good wait staff but I don't thing the food is anything amazing"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are the thing to get here - they are delicious! Everything else is kind of so-so. Restaurant was very crowded and noisy when we went, but salsa and guac were yummy, and the tacos were beautiful and tasty. Margarita left something to be desired, but fun place to go with a group of friends if you're in the NoDa area. Definitely worth trying once."}
{"text":"Well the tacos at Cabo are delicious! I got the special terriyaki seabass tacos and the steak tacos and both were awesome. There were tons of taco options and the prices were very reasonable.   My only complaint was the sound level- it was so loud inside that when we left, my throat hurt from yelling at my friends during dinner. The music was up so loud that, as patrons, we had no option but to talk louder to hear eachother. Even the waitress had trouble hearing us to take our order."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit the area I always make sure I make time to go to Cabo Fish Taco. Best fish taco I've ever had. Stick with the OG - Cabo Fish Taco fish tacos. They also serve you complimentary corn salsa and chips."}
{"text":"Good, but definitely not as good as it used to be.  Eleven dollars for two small tacos with hardly any fish or shrimp in either of them but way too much cilantro, plus a small side of beans of rice.  All of our flour taco shells were so chewy that we could barely eat them.  Give customers a choice because flour does NOT taste better, plus there's that whole gluten-free craze.  Draft beers were very pricey for a restaurant.  Not in much of a hurry to go back.  The food is fresh though,which is whey they barely earn three stars."}
{"text":"Fish tacos in Charlotte? Pretty good ones too. They were big, really big. Flavorful and fresh. Price was right. They encourage mixing and matching which is key.   Lively atmosphere, nice art. Friendly service. Glad to have a local introduce me. Never would've wandered in by myself."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but I don't know what I was thinking; after crappy Mexican food the night before, I thought I could get good tacos in the south?  Either we were there on a REALLLY off day, or the people who eat here have not had good tacos/Mexican food.  I will say, however, the service was excellent and the iced tea was tasty and my glass kept filled.  I was tempted to go an extra star for the service, but I just can't.  The food.  Meh...  First, the chips and salsa.  Actually, the corn and tomato salsa was probably the best thing I had here - very interesting, but the chips were awful  Completely stale.  Oh, I ate them... I was hungry, but STALE.  I ordered the lemon grilled shrimp taco (sounds amazing, right?) but asked them to make it with the standard accompaniments (cabbage versus mixed greens).  The husband had fajitas.  My taco was fine.  I thought it was weird that it had cheese on it... I mean, it's shrimp so cheese is weird, but I picked most of it off.  The shrimp was good, the tortilla was meh, that cabbage was not crisp.  It came with beans and rice.  I don't eat beans so gave those to the husband.  He who loves the beans left them there without touching them after tasting his own beans.  That was a first.  The rice had something weird in it for a Mexican rice - I'm pretty sure it was Thyme.  Never heard of Thyme rice with tacos.  Cilantro?  Yeah.  Thyme?  Not so much.  After eating my tacos, I said, \"well, what was I thinking trying a second time for Mexican food?\"  The husband replied, \"yours wasn't good either?\"  So there's that.  I've NEVER heard him say he didn't like ANY Mexican food.  He's like a vacuum, especially for the Mexican food.... NOT picky.  I feel bad dinging this place, but it was such a huge disappointment.  What surprises me is how much people love this place and even more that a Cali boy like Guy Fieri put this place on his show and raved about it.  Again, maybe it was an off day while we were there, but I just don't get it.  I cannot recommend this place.  Wait until you get to Cali or heck, even New Mexico before going for tacos."}
{"text":"Heard of Cabo Fish Taco on  Triple D.   Since I had never been to the NoDa neighborhood, we went exploring.  The area is great and the food here was as promised...Delicious.  We had fried oysters with an amazing dip for an appetizer.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their fish tacos are the best in Charlotte! SO DELICIOUS! And they always have a great draught selection. I LOVE CABO!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome fish tacos.  I tried the blackened mahi mahi taco and the beer battered shrimp taco both tasted great.  I also chose the avocado pasta salad as my side and it was great.  It had the right blend of spice and avocado.  I didn't care for the corn salsa that was complimentary with chips when your first seated but that was the only thing I didn't like.  It did not take long to be seated and the customer service was great!  I would definitely recommend it you are in the area.  I look forward to going back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great place. Fish is fresh and seared medium well to perfection. They let you mix and match the two tacos. I think their specialty ones are the best ones.  Margaritas are worth it. Great for groups of friends.  Only 4 stars because service wasn't good. We waited nearly 20 minutes after we asked for our check."}
{"text":"BEST Fish Taco EVER. I really like fish taco's so I get them a lot. Pretty much most fish taco's are very similar. Cabo's were not and they are the best of the best. It was very busy when I was there on Saturday afternoon. We got there in the late afternoon and there was a line. I got a pre-salivation going. We got in pretty fast and the waitress was fantastic. She took her time going over the menu and giving us tips about the food. We had a few questions and ordered. I had the Tavaroo Tuna Taco's and my GF had the BBQ Mahi Taco's. It did take some time for the taco's to get there and that would be my only complaint but they kept bringing those delicious corn taco chips and the corn salsa so that kept me happy. They had a nice beer list also. Always a big plus for me! Then we saw the taco's and got very happy. These things are huge. My GF and I split ours so I got to have BBQ Mahi also. Wow is all i could say. The sauces and the delicious fish were amazing. I would go back in a heartbeat but since I don't live anywhere near, I am just plain sad :( . There is nothing like this where i live but if I am in Charlotte again in the near future, I will certainly be going back. Hail to the Fish Taco at Cabo's!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Fish Tacos in NC hands down! I've made it a point to try the fish tacos wherever I go and I don't think I've found one to beat Cabo yet."}
{"text":"Lemon Ahi Tuna Tacos!  That's all I'm saying!  Okay, I'll say more or they won't add the review. Everything we have had here is good. Hip area of Noda. Their chips and salsa could use a serious overhaul though."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The atmosphere is eclectic and funky and I love their outdoor patio.  The food is spot on every time we come here and the wait staff is always on their game and friendly.  We would probably visit more as we live in NoDa, but since it's such a long wait to get in most days, we try to visit during off hours - like 3pm on a Sunday.  I would highly recommend if you want some good Mexican food in a cool area of town."}
{"text":"Meh is about all I can say about Cabo. I feel like it is super over-hyped... We went in for dinner on a Tuesday night around 7pm. It was pretty crowded but there was no wait. They brought over chips & salsa. The chips were warm but I didn't get the feeling that they were made fresh. They were on the thicker side. The salsa was a mix of corn and tomatoes/peppers (pico de gallo). Not spicy and not really salsa, but ok. We each ordered our own combo taco plate ($10.50) which came with two tacos and a side. I got one BBQ Mahi taco and one Tavaruva Wahoo taco with fruit as my side (seasonal). I was incredibly underwhelmed with my food. The fish in both were way overcooked and dry. The wahoo taco was way salty and the mahi was under seasoned... Another thing that annoyed me, they only have flour tortillas... Really? A fish taco place with only flour tortillas... Even worse, they weren't homemade/fresh. They had that store bought flour tortilla smell. Come on guys... Step it up."}
{"text":"Whenever my wife and I go to a new city we like to try a couple of Guy Fieri's Diners Drive Ins and Dives.    We came here yesterday after arriving in Charlotte.  After taking our drink order we were given chips and salsa. It was a different salsa,  sweet corn,tomato and jalapeño which we enjoyed.  For the entrees the Mrs. had the Carne Asada tacos and I had the Tavarua Wahoo tacos (tuna was substituted for the wahoo). As our normal procedure we always share our order.  The wahoo had a bit of a kick from the honey wasabi sauce.  The Carne Asada was tender and milder with a roasted tomato sauce.   This is a definitely a divey place,  with eclectic artwork from local artists on the walls. They also serve local craft beers which I didn't have an opportunity to try. Maybe next time when I am in town. :)"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to check this place out, though I had been once before, it was new for him. The service was great, and recommendations were made for us. I was disappointed with the guacamole considering it was $9, so I expected it to be fresher. The tacos were good, but that's all they were, \"good.\" The only reason I leave 4 stars is because our server really did improve our experience. So, great service, mediocre food."}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. The guac was top notch and the shrimp pasta with a pineapple sauce was amaze-balls. Order it!"}
{"text":"The taco was superb, I had the beef tenderloin and my wife the salmon wasabi taco. I'll vouch for it, however, that were it ends. The service was mediocre at best and the waitress was not sincere. She was in a hurry and I felt she didn't want to take the time to help us.  When she did start taking our order was rude and short with us. The place has a bit of a grungy vibe, sort of like a dive bar. It had very strange artwork on the wall and a weird ambiance. The waitresses were in street clothes and uncoordinated. Outside of the tacos the chip was stale and guacamole unusually solid (not good).  The salsa mix was corn.  It was just a strange experience. I won't be back at this place."}
{"text":"Yes, Cabo Fish Taco seems to be like a mecca for the throngs of people standing on the street corner waiting to get in on a gallery crawl Friday night in NoDa.  And Guy Fieri stopped by to film his Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show for food network there.  And it is known to be a favorite of NASCAR driver, Kasey Kahne.  But it is also just plain old solid food.  The owners finally knocked out the wall and expanded into the adjacent space after years of slowly doing the construction themselves and it was worth the wait.  They did a fine job adding the nicely finished surfboard bar as well as a refreshing street side outdoor dining area.  If you close your eyes you can imagine that the cars driving by are the sound of waves crashing... alright maybe not...  The fish tacos are obviously good.  The barbecue mahi mahi is insanely tasty.  Personally, I stick with the shrimp tacos when I am going the taco route.  And that is only because there was a lot of inconsistency with the steak tacos.  Sometimes extremely oversalted.  The wraps are also good as I am a fan of the Southwest Chicken wrap.  The combination of just enough spicy with the cooling cucumbers is the key.  For heavier fare, the Surf and Turf Pasta is good.  Plenty of shrimp and steak with bowtie pasta.  Although, it would be easier to eat if they finished prepping the shrimp by taking off the tails.  Sometimes, you just don't feel like eating with your fingers.  The margarita menu is expansive and good.  When the mood hits me, the Silver Surfer satisfies.  Otherwise, they have a solid beer selection to choose from.  Yes, the chips are usually cold, and the corn in the free salsa is canned.  But if you throw in a side of queso, it will curb the appetite that you built up while waiting on the street..."}
{"text":"I love everything about Cabo, their food is beyond amazing. I have been a frequent visitor of the location in Blacksburg, VA and upon moving to Charlotte I was super eager to give this one a try as well. They have a slightly different menu but for the most part it's the same. I tried their sweet chili tofu tacos which was something new to me and they were amazing. I am usually not a huge fan of tofu but these were delicious and the sauce was sweet with a hint of spice but nothing overwhelming. My bbq mahi tacos were actually a spicier than the tofu. I always like to get their margaritas as they are delicious and they have a wide selection. There is normally a wait but the restaurant is a decent size and you usually don't wait as long as they say. Plus, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Looking for dirty Mexican? Won't find it here, but don't worry - Cabo is packin the taco game!!   The Salmon teriyaki tacos are hands down the way to go! Packed with some much favor! And don't forget to ask about thief daily taco special. They usually have some unique options like alligator or shark. Plus, you can mix n match your tacos so come with a group of friends and try them all! Also, something unique, is that Cabo lightly frys their tacos shells, giving them a light, soft, yet crispy texture. Probably one of my favorite taco shells (is that a thing?) in Charlotte.   Now to the sides- you gotta get the avocado pasta salad. It sounds strange, but so delicious. Warning - It's  packed with a little heat, but oh so good!!!!   The margaritas are also pretty solid and they have plenty of options and flavors, including a full bar and a variety of different beers. They usually don't post their specials so be sure to ask your server if there are any!!! I've gotten lucky here before with Dos being the beer of the month.   Now writing this review got me excited to go to Cabo again, as I'm going there tonight!!!! Aye aye!"}
{"text":"I always am blown away by the food here. Serrano chicken taco is amazing. Was glad to be served rice  that wasn't dry and stale like many other restaurants serve. Corn salsa and queso are great.  Only problem is staff. First time I went, server was awkward. Second time, our drinks and chip basket were rarely kept full. Food keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos.  I always pick at least one grilled option.  If you do 2 fried fish options, then it can be too much.  Pasta salad side is really good too."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite restaurant in NoDa. Always a fun atmosphere, fun people, tasty food (especially the Rasta Pasta! - Greatest dish in the WORLD) and Pomegranate Margaritas! Go visit! You'll love it :)"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp tacos and was really surprised. The tortillas were made fresh which is a huge plus. The tacos were also a nice size, plenty of nice sized shrimp. A little disappointed in the jalapeno mashers, they were literally mash potatoes with jalapenos and cheese on top, I don't know I guess I was expecting something a little more unique, but it was still good. $2 beers and good service, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Oh Cabo, I've always meant to visit you! Why didn't I do it sooner? Oh it's probably because you suck. I want to give it the benefit of the doubt, I mean everyone has bad days right? But it's just so bad that I don't want to go back.  So after agreeing to go to Cabo Fish Taco after a pretty bad Eclecfest event at Red at 28th, I was kinda excited. Because Tacos! So after my date and I found some parking, we discovered that we were the first to arrive in our party. I walk in and I'm told by the hostess that there is an hour wait for a 5 person table and a 10 minute wait if we want to squeeze into a 4 person table. I ask to see the 4 person table and it's not really too bad so after some feedback from the others we agree to a 4 person table. Well I went to the restroom, and apparently my friends got told to move it cause they're blocking the hostess's path. Maybe they put up a fight getting out the door who knows, because all I know is after I got out and joined them again to wait outside she yelled my name like she wanted to kill me. My line of work deals with very upset people all the time  so I didn't think too much of it, but my friends and date were quite shocked and upset over it. As we get seated I'm wondering why right next to us there's a perfectly good table for 5 but we're still seated at the table for 4, oh well. Our orders get put in pretty fast I thought after a confusing mix up with them not updating their daily specials board. Chilling with our drinks that don't get refilled, so my date Allen generously refills my cup with his water. About 45 minutes of no water later, when I'm hungry and not happy enough our waitress comes over and says the printer had problems and hadn't printed our orders out (sounds to me like they totally forgot the order). She said sorry I'll keep your water filled at least! Well she didn't even do that. Maybe you could have sent over an appetizer or something after making us wait so long for food and not even checking up on us, because we're hungry!  Finally the food the food arrives at our table, and it's pretty skimpy portions but I'm a positive thinker so I say maybe it'll taste great! Well was I wrong about that. There are way too many onions in the quesadilla, maybe if they had actually stated that there were going to be onions galore in there I would've been able to ask them to omit them. I just wanted a cheese quesadilla guys! We would have been able to share the disappointment in our dishes if the waitress had been around or if we could have heard each other over the loud noise of the place.  So people left hungry, prices are not good for what you get, and there is rude inattentive service there. This place managed to get everything wrong and leave such a bad impression on their customers so why is it so popular? I for one don't have any inclination to return anytime soon, or ever."}
{"text":"Cabo is a home run - every. single. time.  Located in the funky NoDa neighborhood, there's almost always a wait, but it's definitely worth it.  Fortunately, you can put your name in with the host and they'll text you when your table is ready.  While waiting,  grab a drink at one of the nearby bars or browse in the stores across the street.  If there's only 2 of you, take a look at the bar - you may be able to get a seat there.  There's a second bar in the room to the right - don't forget to look there!  Once seated, you'll be greeted with a basket of chips and a bowl of corn salsa.  If you don't care for corn salsa (though, it's d-lish), you can ask for another type of salsa.  Their guacamole is fresh and very tasty.  You also won't be disappointed with shrimp and crab dip - creamy, cheesy, seafood goodness.   My absolute favorite item on the menu is the Tavarua tuna tacos.  You get large pieces of perfectly cooked (medium rare) tuna topped with an amazing honey wasabi sauce - think sweet and spicy.  I also really like the salmon guacamole salad - they will cook the salmon how you like - rare for me - and it's done to perfection!    Whenever we have guests in town, I love to come here. There's something for everyone, but it's still unique and memorable."}
{"text":"I have always gotten the tacos, which are great, until tonight. Tonight, I tried the steak quesadilla, and it was hands down the best quesadilla I have ever had. It was really just the best meal I have had in a while, with great service to boot. Lesson learned: there's more to Cabo than just fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Might be one of my favorite restaurants ever! Hands down, the best fish tacos I have had. The salmon and tuna specialty tacos... Superb. Been here twice now and both times have impressed. I will visit here everything I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Considering, I just came back from Mexico, I was not really excited to have tacos.  However, my hosts insisted.  Really glad they did, I ordered the lemon grilled taco with refried beans.  My wife ordered the beer battered white fish taco.  My Grandmothers ordered the salmon tacos.  We decided to mix and match to try all three and I must say all three were amazing.  The grilled shrimp taco had wonderful flavor, loved the basil and sauce that it was served with.  Also, I love how each flour tortillas is fried to a perfect crispness.  The white fish taco had a nice crunch to it, the salmon taco tasted great as well.  The salmon had a really nice grilled flavor.  Their retried beans were great and the avocado pasta salad had a nice bite to it.  The only item, I did not have was the complementary chips and salsa.  The chips were good, but the salsa was terrible.  It had a lot of corn and red onions, to this tasted more like a coke slaw than your typical salsa.   In summary if, I lived here, I would definitely frequent this place."}
{"text":"If I didn't know where I was, I'd expect to walk out the doors to a beach when I was done eating. Got the tacos before I could even finish one beer. The chips they give you with salsa could be better though."}
{"text":"As advertised. Great tacos, service was prompt and friendly. Will be my go to place in the area."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've had so far! Stopped by because of the place being featured on DDD. They get you in and out quick. Food isn't a long wait at all.   Got a silver surfer margarita and they have some other specialty margaritas. Husband got a lonerider shotgun Betty and really liked it.   Ordered the BBQ mahi mahi fish tacos which was featured in DDD. I've never had BBQ on fish tacos but it goes so well. The sauce is homemade and the soft tortilla is too! It was the first thing we noticed when the tacos arrived. I wish every taco place had these homemade soft tortillas. I could just smack on those alone.  Husband ordered the blackened mahi mahi and he enjoyed that as well. You get two tacos so we swapped one. He got the spicy avocado pasta salad as a side and it was delicious. It's really not spicy at all.   If we lived in Charlotte we would definitely be coming back. There's no parking lot so you'll have to find street parking. You will not be disappointed with the fish tacos. Almost everyone in the restaurant was ordering them. Also featured on the show was the tuna wasabi burrito. I saw someone order that and it looked yummy as well. Another unique part is the corn salsa they give you to snack on. It's got a slight kick and it's just tomatos and corn with chips.   I just wanna go back and try everything off the menu!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! Had the grilled lemon shrimp tacos and beer battered shrimp tacos and omg the flavor was amazing! The cilantro lime.sauce they put on my tacos is amazing.the rice with mago chutney is so good. Friend had the bbq Mahi tacos and they were fanominol better than cali fish tacos! Want to come here everyday! do it! Margaritas are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Lunch at Cabo Fish Taco- ordered the chicken & shrimp burrito, which was good. With peppers, rice and beans, it's very filling but had an interesting, almost sweet, seasoning on it. I tried the avocado pasta salad, which was creamy and spicy."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try this place, so when the hostess said 1 1/2-2 hour wait I thought it would be worth it.  Wrong! After an hour and a half we finally sat down. The waitress came right over and asked us what we wanted to drink without a chance of looking at the menu. Two minutes later she comes back and asks what we want to order. After waiting so long can we have a minute to look at the menu. It's now 9:30 pm. A few minutes later she comes back so we order. We order guacamole to start. Chips come and are cold. Okay, not such a big deal. Then comes the guacamole. YUCK! I think it would be better in a diner. Sort of brown and taste is really gross. Then a couple of minutes later dinner comes. We never even had a chance to eat our disgusting guacamole. Haha. I ordered the Bbq Mahi tacos. The sauce was really good but very spicy. I wish I had known that. But everything including the rice and beans was cold. Obviously it doesn't get heated. Then midway through the meal the waitress comes over and asks if we want a box. Now I am mad. Why can't I have some time to sit and have dinner with my family especially after waiting so long. We will definitely not be coming back. I really wanted to like this place, but absolutely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"ok. fish burrito was decent, but definitey get the crab and shrimp dip"}
{"text":"I had the \"special\" which was a grilled scallop taco with pineapple salsa and the jalapeno/cheddar mashers.  It was tasty but it didn't blow my mind.  However the crab/shrimp dip with deep fried pita triangles was ON POINT.  I could eat that all day, everyday!  Service was very attentive even on a busy Friday night!"}
{"text":"Can not say enough good about this place.  I always get the two daily specials and fruit side.  If there is a better place to eat lunch, it is not on this planet."}
{"text":"great queso with the white cheese.  great fish tacos."}
{"text":"The best taco spot in town! You must go. Even if you do not like taco's they have bowls, pasta, and salads.  I love the chill atmosphere and I am a customer for life."}
{"text":"I live in NoDa but tend to avoid Cabo because I have never really had a great experience there.  And I actually wonder what I am missing when I read other peoples rave reviews.  But I was working from home on Fri and some former co-workers were heading there so I decided to suck it up and meet them.  It was packed at 12:15 and even though the 3 others were there they wouldn't seat them until I arrived.  Seemed odd for a place like that but okay.  When our waitress came by she was very abrupt with us and kind of slapped the menus on the table.  Someone else came by and threw the chips and salsa down.  My main complaint with this place is the chips suck, like seriously w/o fail everytime I go there they taste stale and cold.  Do they keep them in a fridge??  Not good.  We split the crab and shrimp dip appetizer, it was good and they pita crisps they give you tasted fresh.  I had the shrimp tacos w/no cilantro sauce because cilantro  makes me gag!  I was offered some honey wasabi sauce and I accepted but never received it.  Oh well, the tacos were actually pretty yummy on their own.  I got a side of the fruit but didn't eat it because it looks like it was really old and had a congealed look about it, no thanks.  Even though the food was good, I still just can't really get into this place, the service, the bad chips, in the past really bad margarita's.  I would much rather hit up Revolution or Solstice if I choose to eat out around home."}
{"text":"i did not like the rice. my friend liked neither the rice nor the beans. refried, to be specific. other than that it was a good time. a restaurant should be judged by its rice, and this just did not meet my standards. i probably won't be returning unless this issue is addressed."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out this very popular place in NoDa.  And of course for my first visit, had to have the fish tacos!  Which were very good. Accompanied by Asian Slaw, and a nice cold beverage, it was a great experience. I really liked the decor, this place really has a comfy feel to it!  My server was very helpful and nice. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"when other establishments (which will remain nameless) closed early, my charlotte tour-guides turned to Cabo for dinner.  The 4 of us all got different selections, and everything was pretty damn good. the tacos were well portioned, and the price was right.  i even had a bowl of black-bean soup and didn't poop myself on the way home, so it was a win-win situation all around!"}
{"text":"This restaurant can have a long wait and not overwhelmingly impressive for the wait it has. My favorite thing there is the steak fajitas which are my favorite. For all the Queso lovers out there unfortunately I would not put this towards my top queso list."}
{"text":"10 years ago I thought very highly of Cabo, but now I feel their food and service is average at best.  I've continued to try this place, always hoping that my experience will trump my previous visit and I've finally decided to give up.  The food is not great.  It's not bad, and it's a cool place to visit since it's a Charlotte staple.  Service here is also not a priority.  I'm learning to appreciate the places that train their staff to always be polite and professional.  This staff really doesn't care about your experience.  Common niceties are uncommon for many of the staff that just want to get you in and out and on to the next.  There are better fish tacos in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love Cabo - the food is great! I have never had a bad fish taco here.  Love the beer.  Love hanging out with my friends here and meeting new ones.  This is a MUST visit place in Charlotte and I feel that it anchors the NoDa area."}
{"text":"I thought every thing was incredibly bland and pretty boring.  I had the blackened mahi mahi tuna tacos with rice. Not hot/spicy at all. The chips were good, as well as the guac but the corn \"salsa\" left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Amazing food, but can't go very often because the wait is so long!! We've even put ourselves on the list just to go home and hang out for 2.5 hours until they text us.  They need to expand, badly! The food is so very good!"}
{"text":"Like YES PLEASE! Love this place!!! Great spot and awesome food! Especially the shrimp tacos! Whether you like spicy or your more on the mild side like myself, it's a must try place! Ooooo and the mash potato side is AAAMAZING! YUM!!"}
{"text":"Had a really good time here. The food was good, but the music was too loud. I'm no prude, but I do like to hear myself think and the company I'm with talk. Other then that, excellent."}
{"text":"I recently had one of the most disappointing experiences in a restaurant that I can remember and it made me want to review one of the best experiences I've had in Charlotte: Cabo Fish Taco. There's a ton that's been said about this place. It's got a lot of hype and lines out the door to prove it. After living in Charlotte for almost 20 years, it was time for me to try it out. And it did not disappoint!  Food- 2/2 *Excellent. Loved the flavors of the BBQ Mahi tacos. We tried several different kinds and loved them all. They were really something I had never tried before. Personally, I loved the corn salsa that comes with the chips. We order an appetizer of queso, and it was also very, very good. One minor note that I believe to be a fluke- the chips seemed a little stale. I haven't read any comments about them before, so it probably was just a bad batch.   Atmosphere- 1/1 *As mentioned elsewhere, it is loud inside. But I didn't sit inside, I waited the extra 15 minutes and sat outside on a beautiful June evening. It was worth the wait. This place fancies itself as a West Coast taco shop and sitting outside, it felt that way to me. I don't know if I would go back and not sit outside. I enjoyed the atmosphere there.   Price- 1/1 *No major complaints. Normally, I would frown on paying $12-15 for two tacos, but they filled me up and is loved them. I'm willing to pay a few extra dollars if I like the food and I leave full.   Service- 1/1 *I cannot write enough good things about the service that we received here. It wasn't that it was over the top or extra attentive. Our waiter was running around like crazy, it was packed. Yet despite the busyness of the evening, our waiter really valued us. He gave great recommendations. It was clear he had tried everything on the menu multiple times. He never missed a refill on drinks or chips. And here's the thing that awesome: I love queso. I will eat every last drop of queso and the lick the bowl. I love queso. Our waiter had noticed me scooping out every last drop and unannounced brought us another bowl of it, free of charge! Now, I didn't need any more queso, since this was after our meal. But this communicated a ton to me: it communicated that he took notice of the experience I was having and he wanted to g out of his way to make sure that I wasn't just having a good night at Cabo, but a great night. Most wait staff don't operate as if it's their restaurant that they are invested in. I don't know who this guy was, but you could tell this was HIS restaurant and that mattered to him. I loved it (both the queso and the gesture). I've never experienced anything quite like that. It was awesome.   I live 30-35 minutes away from NoDa. It's a trendy area and I'm hardly trendy. In fact, most of the time I feel out of place and uncomfortable around so many cool, hip people. Needless to say, I don't stumble into the NoDa area. And yet, I can't wait to go back. The other night I was getting takeout by myself and I wrestled long and hard about making the drive, finding a weird place to park and walking through crowds of people that are much cooler than me just to eat those tacos again. And I don't think I'd feel that way if it weren't for out waiter that night. He was awesome and whoever he is- 'thanks for taking care of us that night. You realize we could have eaten a lot of places and we tried your restaurant. It won't be the last time.'"}
{"text":"They fit a lot of people into a small space, so it can be crowded and slow service sometimes...but the food always has great flavor!"}
{"text":"Such a funky fun place. Firstly love Noda, love the outside/inside seating feels like Asheville. The food is gorgeous, it is art. Margaritas have their own menu. I don't give 5 stars for this reason, I just wish there was a Taco that was just not so spicy. When they say it's not spicy, it still hurt me- (BBQ mahi taco, fantastic) but I have to disclose I have an incredibly low spice tolerance. Even though it was spicy (for me, and I stress that) I could taste such amazing blends of flavors, and the quantity of meat and fun in the taco is more the size of a burrito, so don't shy from the price. Too it all off with friendly, likable, helpful staff. Love you Cabo Fish Taco, please give me one.. \"sweet\" fish taco, you know what I mean.. maybe a sweetish slaw, advocado cilantro something.. any space with so much attention to detail could give me one not too spicy dish."}
{"text":"Diners, Drive in and Dives! A must try place! So we trekked out after work yesterday. I love the location, Love the style, people and atmosphere. The place was packed! Everyone seemed to be having a great time and the vibe was hip and cool!  Service was a little slow! Chips were average and not fresh, Salsa was nothing much to speak of a bit of a disappointment.  I had three taco's Mahi, Shrimp Tara something..... all were good Tara was #1 Shrimp was #2 and Mahi was #3. Mashed Potatoes were forgettable"}
{"text":"Fresh fish cooked to perfection.  Every dish at our table was bursting with flavor.  Really good beer selection and friendly service.  Especially liked the Tavarua tacos which were lemon rubbed grilled tuna with a honey wasabi.  Atmosphere was an urban funky vibe but still tame enough for our kids who were with us.  All walks of life dining side by side.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great food, better service. First time visit last night. Everything came out fast yet fresh. The bbq mani tacos are dank. Definitely will visit again when in town and recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Check your tastebuds at the Door!   Cabo Fish Taco, you give Fish a real BAD name, you give Taco a Bad name, you even give Taco Bell a Bad name!  I've had better!  I've had better at Taco Bell and sadly, or maybe not, I've had better HERE at Cabo Fish Taco, so what is going on... It does not seem they are slipping it seems more like a Fall a dive in quality and flavor, not a swan dive, a NOSE Dive!  Fishy, Mahi Mahi should not NOT taste fishy especially when it has BBQ sauce to mask the flavor of the Fish, still fishy tasting!  The Menu said it was Mahi, so maybe it was a mistake, we made one too!  Glad to say neither of us became physically ill!  The Mashed Potatoes were so Cold as if they came out of the Refrigerator... Equally as disappointing as the worst parts of the meal!  What is cooler than cold, Tacos at Cabo Fish Taco!  Some food is like Revenge (better when served COLD)!  If they could make everything as good as their Corn Salsa I would be giving them closer to two or three yelp stars!  My Beer Battered Shrimp Taco (the Dish that used to be good here) was the best part of the meal and it was not very good!  The Wrap was COLD and the sauce had little flavor!  The other Dish I previously enjoyed here (years ago) was the Nopalito Salad I call it a Bean and Cactus Salsa! This time it was almost flavorless   The service was friendly and laid back, maybe a little too laid back since our food came out room temperature and since there were only two other tables (of two people each and they were already eating) it would be different if they were busy!  Here is how they approach the question they should have asked \"How was your meal?\"?  Instead they say : \"Everything's good isn't it\"?  They noticed we did not eat very much!  They knew we did not enjoy it!  One improvement is the Boys Bathroom!  Congrats!  This is a good upgrade from years ago!  If the food could have stayed good. I'd settle for going outside like before, (I was not the only one)!  I know you can get in trouble for that, so I'm glad they made that improvement!  The meal was so disappointing we went out to eat AFTER leaving this place!  After an experience this poor I want something good to make sure I still have Taste buds!  I did!!!  This place is probably still very popular and could be a cool place to hang out!  Sincerely I hope they were only having a Bad evening!  I hate writing 1 star reviews!"}
{"text":"Very tasty!  I had blackened Mahi Mahi tacos and, of course, a margarita.  Good and very filling!  They did bring my brother a shrimp taco instead of a fish one but they were very accommodating about it and let us keep it (my niece devoured it) while they made him a fish one.  I loved the corn salsa they brought out, preferred it to regular salsa!  Nice atmosphere and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great place for fish tacos. Been coming here for years. Non better in the Charlotte area. They have specials all the time."}
{"text":"As an establishment it has turned into a novelty.  Everything I ate lacked real flavor and instead was coveted in jalapeños. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"The key to getting a table at Cabo Fish Taco without a long wait: Go for lunch! We have previously tried going here for dinner and found the wait to be ridiculous. So this time we planned accordingly and came for lunch around 12:15 on a Saturday. No wait for us! But as we were leaving, there was quite a crowd waiting for a table, so be sure to get here earlier rather than later unless you want to wait.   The service and food here was really good! We asked our server what he recommended and he pointed out 4 of their most popular specialty tacos. So instead of having 2 of the same tacos for each of our meals, we mixed each of our meals up and got to try the 4 that he recommended. The BBQ Mahi and the Honey Soy Glazed Salmon were my overall favorites in terms of flavor. But as for the fish, I really liked the quality of the tuna that was in the Tavarua Tuna tacos.  The fourth one we tried was the Lemon Grilled Shrimp, which was just ok in comparison. I think this is one of their \"safer\" options for those who are not crazy about fish.  To me, it needed a little more kick or spice. I also found that the fish tacos were WAY more filled than the shrimp taco.  Overall, the food was really good but it wasn't mind-blowing. It was solid food, solid service and a solid atmosphere. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"The food was hyped up by hipster foodies so I came in with very high expectations. The food was good(ok), but the service was incredibly fast and the staff was super attentive. A fun and eclectic environment like most of Noda! It's definitely worth trying out for a tacos and beer kind of night."}
{"text":"The corn salsa was good. The lemon grilled wahoo fish tacos were real dry, the fish). The shrimp and crab dip, way too creamy. Not for us.  Also, from several mths ago. :("}
{"text":"We saw that \"Cabo Fish Taco\" in Charlotte, NC was on the Food Network so we decided to check it out.  I ordered the Mahi BBQ Taco and it was very good.  Filling delicious flavor.  I really liked the taco shell.  Everything about it was delicious.  My side was the vegetable medley and it looked and tasted old.  It was not steamed recently or if it was it sat for a while.     I also got a the Tavarua Tuna Tacos which I was not happy with.  Dont get me wrong I love me some Tuna.. I love fresh sushi, grilled tuna (salt & pepper), and even tuna fish holds a special place in my heart.  The Tuna from Cabo Fish Taco really tasted off.  I was really disappointed since I though this was going to be the highlight of my dinner.  It was very fishy tasting so much so that I did not finish the Tuna.    My friend John got the Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos and was not happy.  I tried the shrimp and it did not taste fresh.  Very Bland...   The salsa that is brought to the table was refreshing and had a good amount of corn in it.  We really enjoyed it.    Overall a decent restaurant but the management may want to taste the seafood without all the sauces on it.  If it doesn't taste fresh all on its own its not going to taste fresh mixed in a taco."}
{"text":"So yum!!  Good casual vibe; reggae music playing and an outdoor patio for people watching.  The Cabo Roll Appetizer was filling...should be shared for 3 or more.  I actually REALLY liked the corn salsa w/cilantro & diced tomatoes...it was refreshingly different & more sophisticated than a typical red salsa from a jar.  Beer Battered fish tacos were just ok...put your money on the tuna or the bbq mahi tacos.  LOVED Loved Loved the Tavarua Tuna Tacos...I came in thinking that the seared tuna thing has been cliched to death, but their tuna tacos had a really nice flavor, enhanced by their wasabi tuna & kiwi-pineapple fajita sauce.  I think I'm in love."}
{"text":"My first impression of this restaurant last year was not a memorable one.  We decided to give it another shot prior to a show at the Chop Shop last week and I've been dreaming of the Tavarua Wahoo Tacos ever since (Tuna tacos with a wasabi honey sauce - YUM!). I can't wait to go back just to have that again!  I was also very pleased with our server that evening."}
{"text":"I am from northern virginia and I cant find good fish taco anywhere. My boss and my boyfriends parents (who are from charlotte) says this place is the place to go for fish tacos. I have to say O.M.G so delicious.   I ordered the blackened mahi mahi tacos with black beans and rice and it was so good. They give you so much fish and you can tell it is fresh. They give you two tacos and they are huge!!   My boyfriend ordered the special of the day which was dredged seabass taco and it was amazing too! It was lightly fried and seasoned so well!  Our server was such a sweetheart and was super attentive. She refilled our drinks without even asking! Also the manager/owner came around too and asked how our food was! (Which is a huge plus for me)  P.S this place isnt a mexican style tacos everything has a california style to it. If i am ever back in town this place will be on top of my list."}
{"text":"The best thing we had here were buffalo calamari tacos that were actually a special. They are not on the normal menu, but omg they should be. SO GOOD. AHH. The jalapeño cheddar mashed potatoes are a seasonal side and they were great and tasted homemade. I also had a blackened mahi mahi fish taco that was underwhelming. The fish was pretty bland, I didn't taste any blackening seasoning. The mahi mahi is the only reason this isn't a 5 stars review. I will be back soon! Everything tasted homemade and fresh."}
{"text":"I just moved into the neighborhood and had to try this place out. I'd heard it was the best fish taco joint in town and an all around great restaurant.   My wife and I went for lunch and each got two tacos and a side as per their taco menu. I chose the beer battered white fish tacos with rice and beans and she got the tuna tacos with the avocado pasta salad. You get unlimited chips and salsa when you sit down. The salsa is really good - extra chunky and a little spicy. I was a little surprised at first that the cost was $10-11 for that amount of food, but when the plates came out I understood why. The tacos are HUGE. As in pieces of fish falling out all sides. We munched on several bits with forks before attempting to pick the shell in and go at it like a regular taco. It was manageable from there.   The battered fish tacos were very good. The fish was really soft and tender with a light batter that was very crispy. The sauce was delicious. The tuna tacos were nicely seasoned with a great texture as well. They had a horseradishy flavor from the sauce. The beans and rice were good for what they are and the avocado pasta salad was very good. It was nice and creamy with a delightful avocado flavor.   I will definitely return, but next time I think my with wife and I will split one order as we each took some of our meal home with us and were still full when we left. My one criticism would be that I'd prefer the tacos to be half the size and half the price. It would be an adequate amount of food and only cost a reasonable $5-$6."}
{"text":"This place started out as a 3-star for me and frankly I didn't understand why it was so damn popular.  The service was always really good, and they are on point with the refilling beverages and the chips and the checking up on you.  But the food was just average to me.  After my last experience there, I can now say that it was a \"me problem!\"  I just didn't order the right thing.   I finally tried the tacos rather than going the burrito or wrap route.  The tacos, my friends, are legit.  I got the tuna taco with the wasabi honey sauce and the tofu taco with Thai chili.  Boo yah!  They were both tasty, with an edge to the tuna.    Now I see why people wait an hour and a half on the weekend to eat here.  Just be prepared to experience that wait.  And when you finally get seated, order tacos!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome but drinks are kind of watered down.  Sitting outside is nice because it's quieter and you don't have to yell across the table to talk to your company.  However I had a great time during my last visit!"}
{"text":"Very well priced tacos with great flavors also the staff is very friendly. The ingredients tasted very fresh, we also got a free bowl of chips and corn salsa. Tacos a bit messy \"wet\" but I personally don't mind too much."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the lemon grilled shrimp tacos. My companion's beer batter fish tacos were not as flavorful. Can be very loud when restaurant is full of people."}
{"text":"I've heard crazy good things about Cabo but it didn't really live up to its reputation.  The food was decent but I just wasn't blown away.  I love guac so I had to try it as an appetizer.  It was tasty but after you eat through the top layer of cilantro, peppers and other goodies, it is just meh.  I got the Epic Tuna Burrito for dinner.  It was yummy but I wouldn't especially go back for it.    My biggest peeve was that my margarita was waaaay too sweet.  Another person in my group felt the same way.  We decided to say something since there was obviously something wrong.  Instead of bringing us a new drink they tried to doctor it up.  The waitress said they poured out some of the drink and added more sour mix.  Needless to say, it was horrible.    Also, as a side note, I parked in the bank parking lot across the street and my car got towed.  Be careful and read all the signs :)"}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype. It's a good restaurant with good food but it's in no way earth-shattering. I was happy with service and the availability of cheap margaritas (el cheapo for $5), but it was loud and the wait was an hour.  So it's a nice place to go if you want casual atmosphere and if the line isn't too long."}
{"text":"Always worth the wait. They have the best entrees and tacos. The staff is nice, the place is generally clean. It has a good dive feel without being so grimy or too dirty feeling. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in NoDa, especially on a warm day for lunch."}
{"text":"Wow... My mahi taco was Stuffed and delicious !!! The refried beans too ... If you're in Charlotte... Highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"We gave this place a try last night and were not disappointed. Although the wait was a bit long the service was wonderful once we were seated. We were lucky enough to be seated outside and we got to enjoy the music and fresh air. The inside was a bit old but didn't seem too bad. The food also turned out to be wonderful! We started with the queso which was delicious! My husband had the tuna burrito which he loved and I tried the honey soy glazed salmon tacos which were outstanding! Their wasabi sauce is a bit hot but still tasty. We would absolutely recommend this place and would love to go back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has good reviews.  They are NOT \"authentic\".  They have VERY LITTLE food made in house.  If you want classic salsa (instead of corn salsa) they literally give you Pace Picante (yes, I asked b/c it was pathetically obvious).  If you order a salad be prepared to have a bowl full of roughly chopped veggies that you have to cut yourself (an entire huge tomato in quarters... Bell peppers and red onion in 1 inch think chucks).  The tuna (ordered medium) is dry as toast... Although my boyfriends tuna burrito is a perfect medium.  The margaritas are watered down and the chips are stale (and definite not home made).  The cheese dip is heavy as a brick and tastes (and looks like velveeta).  What else is there to say?"}
{"text":"I have to say that this was one of the biggest disappointments I've had in a restaurant. I had seen Cabo on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and couldn't wait to try it. I do not live in Charlotte any longer but was in town to visit relatives for the holidays so this was kind of a destination. The NoDa section is very much out of the way but it is a neat area with what they have done with it. There were 3 of us eating so we had a chance to taste a few different things. First of all they were jam packed which was a good sign but resulted in terrible service. We sat for about 5 minutes before anyone said hello and finally Pete showed up. He was friendly enough and took our drink orders. I had an IPA on tap and another one of us had the Original Cabo Margarita. The beer was great but the margarita was the worst margarita ever served. We asked for the margarita to be served \"up\" (no ice) and what showed up was a glass full of tequila and triple sec, no mixer what so ever. We asked Pete about this and he said he told the bartender that it was supposed to be served straight up and he guessed the bartender took that to mean just the liquor. Anyway Pete took it back and had them add the mixer and it really wasn't any better. As far as lunch was concerned, I ordered a bowl of seafood chowder and the blackened Mahi Mahi tacos with a side of black beans and rice. My wife ordered the battered white fish tacos with a fruit side and my brother ordered the battered white fish tacos with a side of mashers (mashed potatoes). A few minutes later our lunch was served. They forgot to bring my seafood chowder and instead of bringing me black beans and rice they served me mashers ( I didn't bother to say anything). My tacos were okay. The tortillas that they were served on were very good, the accouterments served on the taco were bland and virtually tasteless and the mashers were okay. I told them to just forget the seafood chowder. I also had one of the battered white fish tacos and they were tasteless as well. The fruit side was good. Our billed was $47.80 + gratuity which would have been fine if the food had been decent. Overall I would not recommend this restaurant and I definitely will not return. Charlotte has way too many good places to eat without wasting time and money here."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say that I found one of the Ally Lucky Pennies in front of Cabo Fish Taco, which definitely doesn't hurt the rating I'm giving them.   Anyway, the evening I found the penny my fiancée and I decided to celebrate by going back to Cabo. I had an awesome experience there a couple of years back, and this was no different. We were seated promptly and the waitress got waters to us immediately and also got our margaritas out quickly. She answered all the questions we had about the menu in a precise fashion.   I decided on the grilled Mahi Mahi burrito with a side of pasta salad and my fiancée got the Carne Asada burrito with fresh fruit on the side. The food came out quickly and was perfectly cooked. The Mahi Mahi was just spicy enough to break a sweat, but not overpowering. Same with the pasta salad, just enough spice and flavor. No complaints from across the table the Carne Asada was tender and flavorful and the fruit was fresh and succulent.   Still on the hunt for more pennies, and hopefully I'll end up back at Cabo Fish Taco."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in NoDa. Good vibe, friendly service. I unfortunately found a sizeable bone in my blackened mahi mahi taco. It happens and I get that, but was still an off-putting part of an otherwise delicious meal. I thoroughly enjoyed their avocado pasta salad. Chips and corn salsa are good, but I would advise against the queso... everyone at the table agreed it tasted like melted CheezIts"}
{"text":"Born and raised near the Border of Baja, I had some pretty high expectations. The food was pretty good, though my Serrano taco was cold, it had a great flavor and my husband enjoyed the fish taco. The chips were stale (confirming other reviewers). Our service was very good.   The 3 stars is for the dangerous noise level in this place. 30 minutes at this level can cause damage to hearing. The workers in this place should wear protective ear coverings or the owner should take responsibility and protect their workers and patrons from the excessive noise.   The picture is from our decibel reading."}
{"text":"This is our second attempt to get in to this bustling restaurant and as usual the waitress said a wait time of 30 to 45 mins. After an excruciating wait we got to our tables. Our waiter was okay but never acknowledged the fact we waited a whole 45 minutes to get to our table. Once you order there is an another delay which might take some waiting before you could dig in. The tacos were okay tasting and not very flavorful. The quantity of food was mediocre. Be warned all that waiting would make you really hungry. Overall if i look back, I could only remember the waiting and nothing about the food. The restaurant is at a great place and Tacos with sea food is definitely inviting, but considering all the toil, I rather see someplace else."}
{"text":"Two and a half stars, Ok but not so great.  Another Sunday fighting the crowds at Ikea - I recently bought two complete kitchens from them what a Pita!! - from there to the nearest home depot. I'm rarely at that end of town so I ask the young man behind the counter what's a good place for brunch in NODA and he says .... Cabo Fish taco.  Great idea!   We get there about 2:30, the place is busy but not unmanageable. Mexico and Marley theme joint, my partner asked if it was a part of a chain. Told her, no but it wants to be. We get a table immediately, the waitress is very friendly and attentive, although the bar was slow getting the drinks out.   - Salsa and chips. Boooring, the corn heavy but too light on onions and spice mixture is no salsa and chips are cardboardy - I'd be surprised if they're not packaged.   -The skinny Margarita got two thumbs down but I was cozy with my Negra modelo.   - Mahi taco .. with tangy bbq sauce? The sauce was tasty but out of place, it overpowered the whole dish. Mahi, which in Fla we usually call dolphin is a strong tasting fish that can even be served blackened and it's flavor will still come through. Here it was so bland it could have been a chicken. It wasn't bad but the mahi taco tasted like bbq chicken taco so I'd call that a fail. My companion said she would have liked it if it hadn't been for the sauce , not me.  - Honey wasabi Tuna wrap, hu menu says burrito. Exact same result, wasabi/honey is the only flavor that came through and the wasabi tasted more like sharp yellow mustard than like wasabi.  And I'm a wasabi eater, at home I even use it on cold chicken or cold roast beef.  Tuna, unlike mahi is easy to overpower but still that was another honey/mustard chicken wrap not a fish burrito.  The refried beans and the mashed potatoes with jalapenos were the best thing of the whole meal. Price was reasonable. Would I go back? No, it wasn't bad but the food was Charlotte-grade boring."}
{"text":"Really like Cabo fish taco. I first found out about it because they were featured on some tv show. After that, I had to have the bbq mahi tacos, omg delicious. I will definitely go back. Good service and good prices."}
{"text":"I was expecting a great meal after reading the reviews for Cabo Fish Taco, but left feeling underwhelmed. We stopped in for dinner on a Thursday night to be immediately seated. The restaurant was packed and the waitress very attentive throughout our meal. I had the lemon tuna and beer battered fish with a side of the spicy pasta salad. The fish taco has a lot of breading and not as crunchy as I would like. The tuna included seemed quality and big chucks. The waitress recommended the spicy avocado pasta salad, which I found not to be spicy and too much mayo for my liking. Both tacos were stuffed with fish making them difficult to eat without making a mess. The tortilla really shined here as they are homemade and served warm. The chips were a huge bummer as they tasted stale and over cooked. I did enjoy the corn and tomato salsa and chipotle cheese dip, but the chips kept me from really digging in."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had! This was my first time here & the server really helped me navigate the menu. I was interested in the tacos since I hear they're famous for them :-) Best part about their tacos is you can mix & match any two, which is great for someone like me were its hard to decide between two!   I ended up getting one of the salmon tacos & one of the tuna. I can't stop raving about how great they were! From the taco shell to the seasoning to the delicious meat inside, everything was excellent. You can also choose one side & I got the spicy avocado pasta salad... I was curious with this one, but once again did not disappoint!   I highly recommend this place and its conveniently located next to other fun pastry shops & bars. For parking, you're looking at street parking or there is a lot in the far back that you can pay the meter."}
{"text":"My first couple of times at Cabo we're not impressive - in Blacksburg or in Charlotte; my husband and I were both impressed with our service and quality of food at our last visit. Waitress made sure that our drinks never went dry and that we had everything we needed throughout our meal. The food was perfect - my husband especially loved the wasabi tuna taco!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place being that I have Baja roots (I'm from Cali and i frequented Baja Cali all my life). Unfortunately, the food reminded me of an office party that was \"Mexican\" themed. In which,  people serve salsa, queso , and beans from a can purchased from a local American grocery store. As I prepared myself to eat my shrimp battered tacos, I realized that things weren't getting any better. My tacos were cold, my cheese dip was cold, and my beans were cold too. The corn medley being used as a chip dip should be a crime! That's Tex Mex, NOT Baja at all!!! Also, I have a big problem with having a pasta, guacamole, something or other as a side dish. When we asked for an avocado slice we were informed they didn't have any and they only had guac spread....What?!!! You mean to tell me that my tacos and sides weren't made with fresh avocados?!!!! I have 4 words... NO AVOCADOS FROM MEXICO!!!!   Additionally, my mojito tasted like an alka seltzer, and my waiter was like a student avoiding eye contact so he wouldn't be called on. Overall, this experience has me feeling like Biggie Smalls....\"I'm going back to Cali Cali\""}
{"text":"The service (to a point) and the food is great. It was VERY disappointing when the server cashed out to tell us that the bartender would take care of our order. Then two server/employees walked past to remind us that \"the time is correct\" in shouting voices as they passed our table. The last I checked, our \"NJ\" server and our table was respectable of a $200+ tab.  Go past 8:30 on a weeknight and service goes to a 1+. Food is phenomenal. Service before cash out - great! After that...double negative."}
{"text":"Drinks? Fabulous! Tacos? Mouthwatering! Service? Fantastic! Keep this in mind and don't be discouraged if you show up and have to wait for a table. Grab a drink and get comfy - it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Expect to wait for a seat at this spunky little fish joint. Very casual...don't expect to sit at the bar while you wait for your seat b/c it only seats about 9-10 people tops! The regular fish tacos are not the way to go....they're at the bottom of my pile- do something different- sword fish, etc.....they make a pretty darn good mojito as well. I recommend checking it out when you're in the area; plenty of things to do next door as well if you have to wait for your seat."}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place since I moved to Charlotte but anytime I go it's a long wait...so I leave. But finally I have arrived and there's no wait. It's a Saturday at 12:45. Who knew??? Brunch time seated immediately. I think we made the last three available tables. Thank goodness because the food was exceptional, the drinks were toxic, the staff was helpful and the ambiance was a typical Saturday, busy morning. Loved every bit of it. My Baja Bowl was so pretty and I had two people order the same thing based on my choice. A great one I might add. Also this restaurant is in a great location. Who doesn't love NODA!!!!!!(that was a statement)"}
{"text":"Good fish tacos. Mahi Mahi and fried shrip are my favorite! Combine it with $2 Tecate with lime and you are on your way to complete satisfaction!   Service can be slow at times. When we sat inside it was slower but when we sat at the Patio it was faster. IMO"}
{"text":"My Husband and I love this place. We usually split the special with a side of rice and beans. I love the Mexi Mahi Burrito as well. They give you plenty of chips and salsa and the service is generally pretty good. Some servers are better than others. Wouldn't recommend this place for a large group of people who want to carry on discussion throughout dinner because it is a bit loud. But other than that, never a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I am rating the food and restaurant 4/5 stars. The reason I am rating them 3 stars is my overall experience. I LOVED the tacos but I felt sick after 30 min of eating there. Don't get me wrong I would still come here and enjoy the cool, hip vibe."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced and great portion sizes. The service was quick, my margarita was tasty, my tacos were fresh. It's lacking the extra kick that would take it to the next step, but that does not take away from the excellent job that they do. Get the avocado pasta salad as your side, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Planned ahead and arrived in plenty of time before the band we were going to see later that night. This restaurant is within walking distance of some great small music venues and galleries in NoDa. I was prepared as I watched the Triple D excerpt on their web-page and checked out the menu on-line. We had quick service and plenty of chips and corn/pico type salsa to prevent over ordering. 3 of our party had the Tuna with Wasabi burrito and not a one of them offered me a bite so they must have enjoyed it very much. I went with what they are know for- a blackened Mahi fish taco and a beer battered shrimp taco. both were good, the Mahi was better. I also had the Silver Surfer Margarita, fresh and tasty, no syrupy mixer. I would eat there again if for no other reason than the convenient location and to try something new."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than Blackened Mahi Mahi Tacos and a Silver Surfer Margarita and the only place you can find such a delicious meal is...........CABO FISH TACO!!!!!!  I have fallen in love with this place over four years ago and am so very thankful for the expansion and outdoor area.  They could extend the whole block and still have an hour wait on weekends.    I have tried many things on their menu, but I stick with my old faithful because it's crazy good.  I have never actually had bad service there, mostly the wait staff is attentive and very easy going with suggestions about the menu or specials.    Will continue to frequent!  Thank you for being awesome"}
{"text":"Decided to eat at this restaurant since it was featured on Guy's Diners, Drive- ins, and Dives. We went on a Friday night thinking we'd have to wait but were surprised to find no wait and a simply smooth, and enjoyable experience. Our waiter was very nice and helpful. I got the Sweet Thai chili tofu tacos with the tofu grilled instead of fried in beer batter. For my side I chose the avocado pasta. My husband had the grilled salmon tacos with refried beans as his side. All of their sides are vegetarian. I LOVED his tacos. Definitely felt it tasted better than mine although mine was decent.  You can park on the street. We were roaming through Noda where everything is walking distance so this was the perfect spot to eat.  I'm so glad we came here and recommend it to anyone visiting!"}
{"text":"Wow. This, man. I can't even. I seriously want to move to Charlotte so I can eat here more! We decided to come here due to the Yelp reviews, personal recommendations and the fact that it was on Diner, drive-Ins and Dives. So many good things so I couldn't imagine having a bad experience here, and we certainly didn't! We started off with Guacamole. Holy Moly. It was easily the best Guac I've ever had. It was so smooth! And the taste was great. My boyfriend was convinced it \"came from a can\". Not sure if guacamole has ever come from a can....hahaa. But he was meaning that it wasn't made fresh. Not sure how he was able to tell this, or if it was true. But it didn't stop me from devouring it. yum.  We both got the same Margarita, The Perfect Wave. We got ours on the rocks. Our Margs were delicious! Very happy about that. Really wish we got \"Mas\" for $3 more. Ugh! Next time!  For my meal I got 1 BBQ Mahi-Mahi taco and 1 Tavarua Tuna Taco. I got the Mahi-Mahi taco because it was recommended and that was the one on the show. And I chose the Tuna taco because our waitress said that the Honey Wasabi Sauce was THE BEST. Oh my gosh, yes. And this place does not skimp on the fish! We had huge chunks that were basically bursting out of the tacos. So both were equally amazing. I seriously kept going back and forth to pick a \"best\" and I couldn't. So, just know that you CAN mix and match your tacos! For my side I chose the cheddar jalapeño mashed potatoes and they were delicious! Nothing was bad here. Not even our service! We had an AMAZING time here. Food and atmosphere are on point!"}
{"text":"Can we say...I love myself some fish tacos?! I have been to this place several times when I was a vegetarian ...and still loved it. I have taken a new wonderful liking since started eating fish! My favorite is the Blackened Mahi Fish tacos. As a side, I used to get the jalepeno/cheese mashed potates...yum! Well, they just changed the options and added the avacado pasta salad...WOW...that's the best pasta salad I've ever had...it has a kick to it as well.  The ambience is nice...California-style Mexican; great to sit on the patio as well as inside. Great for take-out as well.  When it's crowded...see if there are available seats at the bar... Noda is doing really well lately and Cabo's here to stay!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The tacos are amazing and I am trying to try them all. My first time there I went with what the server recommended (one shark with pinapple salsa, and the tuna) and was amazed. I didn't think I liked cooked fish until I took a bite of that tuna taco. It was pretty much a life changer. The next time I went with a friend and we halved all the tacos so we could try more. The service has been great, the only thing I don't like is the side dishes, I'd just stick to the fruit salad."}
{"text":"Lemon grilled shrimp tacos were amazing! Wasn't too impressed with the side of rice and beans. Nice ambiance, great service. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is the 86th review of this restaurant so it's hard to make too many fresh comments, but I'll at least put my score into here for statistical purposes.  I cruised through the NoDa area and when I saw Cabo I recalled the decent Yelp! reviews so I figured I'd give it a try.  I went on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy (the rest of NoDa was a ghost town) and the service was prompt and friendly.  I ordered the jalapeno & cheese 'mashers' which I presupposed meant mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately, I was giving the beans and rice, kind of a downer as my GF ordered the beans and rice and we wouldn't get to see what both sides were like.  In the server's defense, she did ask a moment after bringing it out if everything came out right.  I enjoyed everything else enough to just overlook the error.  The chips and salsa were good and, as this was my first time here, came as a bit of a pleasant surprise.  Price-wise I think it was about what I expected $22 for two meals w/ water and tax+tip.  If it was half that price I'd be here everyday perhaps.  One more note, they let me switch the cilantro (yuck) white sauce for honey wasabi (yummy) sauce without a problem."}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco is located in NODA, which is the north end of davidson street.  Everytime we stop by NODA, my bf and I would always see a line out the door.  People were obviously waiting for seats to open up.  We were lucky enough to gone there early on a Wednesday night 6pm, right before my flight to grab an early dinner.  Once we walked in, there were plenty of seats and a reall cool looking booth that can fit up to 10 people.  Would love to sit there, if i were to come with a group of friends.    We were first served chips and salsa! I absolutely love their salsa! It had tomatoes, corn, and pieces of onion.  I guess i love anything that has corn in it!   We both ordered two tacos which comes with a side.  The tacos can mix and match so i got the Beer Battered Fish Taco and the Beer Battered Shrimp Taco with a side of Spicy avacado pasta.  I thought the shrimp taco was more delicious than the fried fish taco.  Reason is because the shrimp was still juicy and chewy even when fried.  I can tell they must of fried the shrimp on the spot, because both the fried fish and the fried shrimp came out pipping hot.  The taco shells were also fried, which was a change in all the tacos i ever had up north.  With every bite, there would a crunchy taste!  I would like to rave about the Spicy Avacado pasta salad! it was definitely delicious!   My bf got the Blackened Mahi Mahi Taco and the Steak taco  with a side of the baha salad?  The side came with black beans, chick peas , and corn i think.  And in our perspective, the side choice wasn't a good one.  However the Blackened Mahi Mahi taco was just okay, and the steak taco was chewy and was cooked to medium well.    Next time i think i would  try the fried shrimp tacos again, and another taco thats not from the fryer to balance out the chew factor taste."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today, I've been meaning to for a while now.  Even though is was Friday lunch the wait was only a few minutes.  Seated quickly, clean table, and promptly served some delicious corn salsa.  The chips were a little soggy but the salsa was great.  I had the Beer Battered White Fish taco.  Batter was nice and light, not overpowering, and really highlighted the fish.    Also tried the Blackened Mahi Fish taco.  Nice spice! The Mahi was a little dry but when you got a bite of Mahi, cabbage, creama it was perfect.    I'll be back to try the BBQ Mahi fish taco."}
{"text":"I may have had high hopes from reading the previous reviews. My expectations were not met there was too much corn in everything and the salsa that they give had a hint of like cinnamon which was really weird. The food came and I had the fish burrito and it was massive but mainly filled w beans. If you want authentic Mexican food go up the street on North Tryon to El Taco Veloz."}
{"text":"I really like the laid back atmosphere of this place and the funky decor inside. The service is excellent. The only problem is the parking in the area and that the food is so good that if you come at the wrong time you will have to wait a while.  I recommend the queso dip and, if you like it spicy which I do, the green tomatillo salsa for an app. I've never had a bad entree here. Great burritos and tacos. But i believe the best item I've had is the BBQ mahi tacos. And they have a good selection of craft beers on tap.  Go, you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Friendly service legit tacos. trust me i was raised in California. Very busy is always a good sign."}
{"text":"My friends and I truly enjoyed our visit to Cabo Fish Taco ... all 8 of us was ticked away in a cute booth ... we laugh, cried, took pics, acted silly and ate some really fresh and authentic food ... we will continue to visit this location as it is a hidden gem, currently being discovered"}
{"text":"One question: who the hell is in charge of the chips? Because they need to be fired.  I was here twice in one week and both times the chips were stale - to be clear, like, been sitting in my pantry for the last year with the bag open, stale.  Such a shame because the food is otherwise very good.  Just so stupid. Chips are cheap and not exactly hard to get right."}
{"text":"Went here with a Friend before a concert. He saw then reviewed on diners-drive-ins-and-dives. I loved the TAVARUA (TAV-A-ROO) TUNA TACOS. One of the best fish tacos I have had. Tasted like sushi if you can believe that. I also tried the BBQ MAHI TACOS. No that impressed. It was good but I was not blown away. As for the tortilla chips they were stale? This is why I am not giving Cabo 4 stars. Along with that, they give you Corn Salsa and personally not my favorite, I would rather have a tomato based salsa. But that is me. Furthermore, you have to buy your GUACAMOLE and GREEN TOMATILLO SALSA for $6.50 and $3.95. The Guac was not great and only a ice cream scoop worth for $6.50. Need to offer free salsa. The good is this is not your average Mexican taco join. They do have burritos as well but did not try any."}
{"text":"Great place for tacos! They start you off with some free chips and fresh salsa which was nice to munch on before our meal. I had the honey soy glazed salmon and the lemon grilled shrimp tacos; both were great but my favorite was the shrimp!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Charlotte my moving company absolutely raved about this place and said I must try it, when a friend was moving to Charlotte he said \"I want to live as close to Cabo Fish Taco as possible!\" So I figured this must be a pretty great place to eat.   Not only is the food great, the service is really good too. I've been to some \"classy\" places in Charlotte only to have to experience tarnished by poor service skills. Cabo Fish Taco has it all going on!   Its been two days since I've been there and I am already CRAVING more beer battered shrimp tacos. With family coming to town for Thanksgiving I think I might have to find an excuse to take them here."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and decided to check out NoDa. Very happy that I chose Cabo Fish Taco. I sat at the bar to have a few drinks and ordered some food. I had the BBQ Mahi Tacos with a side of pasta salad. The tacos were excellent, not too much bbq so you could still taste the mahi. Pasta salad was also amazing; might be too spicy for some, but unlike anything I've had before. Overall the food and service was excellent and I will be back."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and I am very impressed with the variety and selection here. I tried the southwest wrap and it was spicy, but extremely good. My godson ordered the pecan praline cheesecake and unfortunately didn't leave me any. Cool atmosphere, friendly staff, nice art. Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Great Food and Atmosphere!! Located in a very eclected neighborhood with lots of interest.  We only had a 20 minute wait on a mid day Saturday afternoon for a table for four in what appeared to a crowded fan favored restaurant. My nephew who lives in Charlotte had been there once before. He thought it was a good place to try as one of my Food Network featured Charlotte restaurant locations.  Cabo Fish Taco didn't disappoint! The server was very pleasant and steered us in the right food direction with our food choices. We had the Crab & Shrimp Dip, BBQ Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos, Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos, Chicken Quesadillas and Southside Chicken Wrap Burrito. We ordered the \"Bannas Foster Cheescake (just okay) and Peanut Butter Chocolate Mousse Cake\" (a better choice) desserts to go, but ended up eating them there!  We all were pleased with our selections, especially the warm \"Crab & Shrimp Dip\" appeitizer (featured on the FN episode) freshly made pita toast points. The \"BBQ Mahi Mahi\" Fish Tacos (also featured on the FN episode) was our favorite entree of them all. The free salas (Chopped Tomato, Corn and Cilantro) was a refreshing change compare to other table side Mexican salas.  If ever in Charlotte, NC again, I would make a track over to this place no doubt!!"}
{"text":"Unique flavors in a funky location. Be sure to sit on the patio. The salsa and chips were okay. Salsa was more of a relish with corn, tomatoes, etc. It wasn't very juicy. We ordered the queso and it was a little thick for my liking. The tacos had great flavor. I was not a fan of the fried flour tortilla with them...I would prefer just a fresh tortilla. I was not impressed with my side (a rice with a mango salsa on top). My husband was also not too impressed with his garlic and jalapeño mashed potatoes. Definitely try the Wahoo Taco.  Great service. Would go back for the people and the atmosphere.   Check out the Women's Restroom....it had 2 toilets, side-by-side with no divider. It was a single room. Thought it was kinda odd!!!"}
{"text":"A bunch of us were visiting a friend of ours in Charlotte this past weekend and we came here twice, since it's my friends go-to spot!  Being vegetarian, I was a bit skeptical due to the name of the restaurant and I didn't want their random veggie option that they throw on the menu to accommodate the non-meat eaters and typically would just be a crappy taco with some veggies.  However, I glanced at their menu and other Yelp reviews on our drive over, and I was thoroughly impressed with the amount of vegetarian options they had - burrito, fajitas, and a couple of tacos.  They also weren't 'cookie-cutter' and seemed innovative and tasty.  This place is HUGE.  It's (I believe) in an up-&-coming neighborhood of NoDa, and there is new construction being built left and right.  There's tables all over the place in the massive space, with a small bar in the back center.  Off to the side, there's another room with tables/booths, and a small, covered patio for outdoor seating.  Both times we went, we sat on the outdoor patio as the ceiling helps with the heat.  The only knock is that they may not have all their beers on tap - when a few of us came on Friday for lunch, my friend ordered three different beers, and each time, the bartender told us that they were out.  Being from Philly/New York, I have to say the service was impeccable.  Everyone is super nice and friendly, but I also guess that's the norm down here.  Our waitress, both experiences, came to our table to check up on us often.  Onto the food...they start you off with some chips and fresh, homemade salsa with diced tomatoes, cut onions, and corn.  It was simple, and refreshing...they even threw in some black pepper to give it a little kick.  They also keep refilling them for you, which is a blessing and a curse.  For my meal, I got the beer-battered tofu tacos on Friday and the sweet thai chili tofu tacos on Sunday.  Both were delicious and packed with crispy, fried tofu chunks.  If I had to pick, I'd lean towards the sweet thai chili as they packed a more flavorful punch.  The beer-battered ones were a bit dry, as I head to drench cholula into it to make the flavor profile stand out because the white ranchero sauce wasn't doing a whole lot.  They come in a crispy, chalupa-like shell, which is great because most veggie tacos are runny and break apart easily as the liquids from the veggies get all over the place.  However, these stayed in tact and gave it a nice crunch to it.  I must warn you - they put A LOT of tofu in it.  I don't know if they're trying to make up for the fact that it's vegetarian, but I easily took out at least 3-4 pieces of tofu in each taco so I could eat it easily.  Overall, a solid place, and can definitely see why they're always packed for lunch and dinner.  My friends who eat meat loved their dishes - whether it was the mahi mahi tacos, the carne asada, or the shrimp."}
{"text":"Another amazing experience. Wish they took reservations so I don't have to wait up to an hour, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"We visited on a bustling Friday night and have our name to the hostess for a table. We were seated in about the quoted time and were greeted promptly with chips & the house corn salsa with a preliminary drink order taken. We wound up ordering the shrimp & chicken burrito (without shrimp haha) and a taco plate with the white fish and carne asada. Both were fabulous and filling. Many creative menu items and plenty of options for a non-fish lover like myself! Ingredients were fresh, presentation was good and service was good as well. Waited a bit for the bill, but hey it was a Friday night and we ate rather quickly. Fun & quirky ambiance. Reggae tunes on and servers wearing plaid ;) funky, mon!"}
{"text":"We have been back multiple times since this occurred and have nothing but good things to say.   Always recommend it to friends and suggest the barbecue mahi tacos. He guacamole is fantastic too with bits of jalapeño on top."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of fish tacos, so this place definitely hits the spot.  When I visited, I tried the Jerk Flounder Burrito and the Shrimp/Crab Dip appetizer.  Both were pretty tasty, but probably not any more special than dishes I've had before.  And,  don't expect the food here to be of any authentic Mexican quality.  I do really like the ambiance.  It's a nice casual place to go with friends, although it does get kind of noisy.  I've also heard that weekends are pretty packed, but I went on a Thursday night, and it was fine."}
{"text":"Cool place.  Charlotte Landmark!! Out-of-town guests loved it!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from almost everyone around Charlotte. The inside is super cute! Great atmosphere for a night out with a group of people. Chips and salsa weren't my favorite. It's more like pico then salsa."}
{"text":"As a Charlotte resident for a little over six years, this place has pretty much been a go-to throughout this time. I'm surprised that I haven't gotten around to write a review about Cabo until now.  The place is pretty loud especially during peak times (Friday and Saturday nights) but it has a fun and funky vibe. If you plan to go during peak times, be prepared to wait. However, the plus sides are that they text you when your table is ready and there are a number shops and bars to stop in while you wait.  In my recent visits, the waitstaff has been SUPER friendly and accommodating. You automatically start off with a small-ish bowl of corn salsa and chips. Personally, I recommend getting one of their signature margaritas. I usually stick with the skinny margarita. As for the tacos, I'm a fan of the BBQ mahi mahi tacos with rice and beans. The rice and beans aren't the greatest but a sufficient enough side choice for myself.  If you are a fan of fish tacos and a laid back time, Cabo is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Their mojitos and tacos are to die for. The ambience of the restaurant is great as well. This is one of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I don't really get the hype. The first time I went the service was terrible and the restaurant was extremely loud. The tacos were flavorless and kind of cold. The second time was a much better experience but nothing to rave about. The queso is really great and so was the wine. Still not my favorite."}
{"text":"The Baja Shrimp and Crab Dip is delicious and a meal by itself. The BBQ Mahi tacos are jammin! Bring your appetite. The tacos are huge!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cabo many times for dinner and always thought the idea of it was better than the actuality.  However, last night proved me a little bit wrong.  The fella and I went out with some friends after work on a Friday evening, and we all managed to get there at different times. If I were the waitress, this would've seriously annoyed me, but our waitress was so nice and accommodating!  We sat on the bar side at a table, and all the doors were open since it was so nice outside.  Throw in a little reggae music and a margarita, and how can you go wrong?  We ordered the Baja Shrimp & Crab Dip and guacamole to start.  The pita for the dip is fried... YUM.  It was warm and buttery, and the guacamole was solid.  (As much as I love avocados, it's hard to focus on them when there's fried bread.)  I got the carne asada tacos for dinner.  The steak was tender and perfectly seasoned, and the peppers and onions balanced out the southwest mayo.  I wish I could tell you what everyone else got, but I was a little too focused on my own food to nicely ask how everyone else's food tasted.  Oops.  By the time we left, the place was slammed and we heard them mention a 40 minute wait.  You'd never know how busy they were from the staff though - our waitress was awesome, and the manager checked in on us once and said bye as we left.  I love some good customer service!  Perhaps I'd misjudged Cabo... I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Tacos r on point. Place is outside the city but definitely worth the trip out."}
{"text":"Eclectic cafe with fresh well prepared California Mexican style food.  There was a wait but the tables move quickly.  We got drinks at the bar and they send a text when the table is ready.  We had the fried shrimp tacos. The portions were generous."}
{"text":"We met a bunch of friends for dinner and drinks at Cabo before heading to the Evening Muse nearby for a show. We had a large party of 14 and management was able to seat us comfortably even though the place was full. Our server was fantastic and very attentive to our entire table. Everyone enjoyed their tacos. I had the tuna and lemon grilled shrimp, both were awesome. This place seems to be very well run as they all seem to help out to make sure you get your drinks and food quickly. I've been to so many poorly run places that I wanted to pass on kudos to this staff for getting it right."}
{"text":"I used to love Cabo, but I think they've gotten too big for their britches.  Our most recent visit paired rude, lackluster service with mediocre food.  It started when they forgot about us for 45 minutes.  We were wondering why our food was taking so long, when our waitress popped over to tell us that \"the printer hadn't printed\" our order, so we had fallen behind.  I am not sure whether that was the truth or not, but when one of our party (half-jokingly) asked if they were going to adjust our bill, she made some snide little joke about all she could do was keep our water glasses filled.  And guess what--she didn't even do that!  When the food finally came, it was pretty bland, and the portions were very small for the price they charge.  I didn't want to pig out, but I left hungry.   Other small annoyances:  -the hostess who sat us was quite rude, at one point informing us that we needed to move because we were \"in the way.\"  Ok, that's reasonable, but that's not how you talk to a customer.  You ask nicely or at least say excuse me.   -The board listing their specials was a night old, so we tried to order things that weren't available.  The waitress looked at us like we were stupid before we pointed out their mistake. -It's loud.  Almost too loud for a bar, and definitely too loud for a restaurant where, you know, you might want to be able to talk with your companions.  I was very disappointed with Cabo this time around... I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! The lemon grilled shrimp tacos with the spicy avocado salad is my go to. Shrimp fajitas are also really good. Salads not so much. Mimosas are $5 Queso is delicious but small portion is offered and it's way too expensive for how small it is.  Super super super busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back again. The food was amazing and I had a blast with colleagues. Definitely love their drinks"}
{"text":"So the amazing Jeff from Outsell is with us and KB the largest leprechaun went to this joint cause it's in the triple D tour and I'll tell you what.   Yes Jeff does eventually stop talking about sales.   And the tacos were da bomb.  That's it.  Great atmosphere nice folk and did I mention good tacos.     Here's a pic.  Just go."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab seafood tacos.  I was in Charlotte for business and a coworker suggested I come here.   This restaurant is located in the the NoDa part of Charlotte, a very cute neighborhood that is worth exploring more if I were to ever come back.  Street parking only for this location. Got here 6pm on a Monday and we were seated immediately.  Seems like a cool and chill atmosphere.  They have a full bar as well.   Once seated, they brought us complimentary chips and corn salsa. From their taco portion of the menu, you can order any two tacos which come with your choice of side dish.  I went with the BBQ Mahi and the beer battered shrimp, with a side of baja rice.  Both were delicious but not too memorable.   Service was nice, food was OK, but not sure I'd make a beeline to come back to this place if I were back in Charlotte for business."}
{"text":"I tried Cabo Fish Taco again, and I really wasn't impressed. I got the veggie burrito, and it was just bland and unexciting. My boyfriend got the cabo fish tacos and was pretty disappointed, especially since this dish is the restaurant's namesake. I wish I liked the corn salsa and chips they give you as an appetizer, but the spices of the salsa are just really off and it tastes gross."}
{"text":"I loved the basic fish taco they serve.  It is simple yes, but delicious.  I wasnt a fan of the sides but the tacos definitely made up for the lacking.  Our waitress was really friendly and very attentive.  I am definitely going back  when I move to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great service great atmosphere and good food!!!! The mahi tacos and jalapeño mashed potatoes are good. Will come back and try the tempura tuna tacos"}
{"text":"still my fav taco place but try their spicy avacado pasta salad!! you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've tried beer battered fish, steak, chili tofu... They're OK.  I don't care for their salsa and the guacamole seems like it may be from a tub. The margaritas are good but not strong. So it's the sweet and tangy BBQ mahi mahi tacos that keep me coming back. I really love those tacos and the mexi slaw. It's really all I ever order. Those two items alone are five stars in my book. Everything else is a so-so 3. I just split the difference and gave them a 4."}
{"text":"I was in town for a business trip and found this place off the beaten path using my streetfinder. It was really chill, laid back and had lots of diverse people in there from college kids to small families with young kids and a couple of people on dates in between. Young waitstaff who were really friendly and energetic waited on you and gave good suggestions for grub. They have a red bull mixed drink that is AMAZING--if you like red bull that is, I forget what they added into it but it was great.  I had the black bean soup, it was spicy and not boring by any means. The tacos I had were not the most tasty but maybe it was because I got the grilled ones and also b/c I had just had a really tasty soup right before.  I would recommend the place though for a relaxed hang out and decent tex mexy kinda food."}
{"text":"Our first time here was very interesting. The salsa that they bring out to you is corn based and just a little spicy. The wait staff was a little slow, but it was a busy night. I ordered the Cabo roll as my meal and it was delicious, however it is super rich so it's self limiting. One of us got the lemon grilled shrimp tacos with refried beans and the other got the tuna burrito. The refried beans have a strange bright citrus taste to them in my opinion, but they were still decent. Also we got a margherrita but they don't offer them as frozen blended, but it was still good. Overall the food was good, there are a lot of choices, the prices are decent, the parking sucks, I would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"In the multiple times I have been here, I have yet to have a less than stellar meal. Everything on the menu is delicious and perfectly crafted. Great ingredients - I especially love the shells they use for their tacos."}
{"text":"Dont really get the hype about this place. I had fish tacos, rice with mango chutney, and a beer. Was reasonably priced and tasted fine, but it wasnt anything to write home about. It's aight."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat here in the QC! Cabo Fish Taco is one of the best spots when you want tacos with a twist. All the flavors are fresh and Work so well together. I got the chicken Serrano taco and the blackened salmon taco. I could of eaten 5 of them because they were so good. I decided to get the rice and beans as my side and my taste buds were dancing in my mouth. I also ordered the Pomegranate margarita and it was the perfect addition to this meal. Prior to the meal, they give you their own rendition of a salsa and it's amazing and fresh. I was surprised there wasn't a wait bc it was mother's day. I also am so happy they've expanded. I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Great food and generous portions. I ordered the fish tacos and guacamole, which were both very good. The guacamole is pretty spicy and has bits of jalepenos mixed in."}
{"text":"Love their tacos and margaritas. Never disappointed when it comes to the food. Wait times can be kinda long since it's super popular but the staff is always friendly and I've never had an order come out incorrect."}
{"text":"Wish I could rate this 3.5, I realllllly like this place, I always have a good time here as well as good service, and yet when I initially clicked 4 stars it didn't feel right.  I have been here multiple times and have never gotten anything I didn't enjoy.  The tacos are great, the queso and salsa are really good as well, have had good burritos, have had good fish, but I think there is a tad of over-hyped-ness that comes with this place.  It's slightly expensive, but to be honest for well prepared, fresh fish you probably should expect a pricier meal. Most times I have been there is usually a wait BUT there is a bar to belly up to whilst you wait OR you are in NODA and there is plenty to see (shops, art, or ppl watch).  Continuing on the wait, the staff is always hustling and it does create an up-beat environment, and it is a fun place, service is great and waits never seem as long as they say.   My biggest gripe with the place might be the beer selection, I know it is a destination sort of place and you want to make sure you have your BMC's covered, but when you are literally one miles from two awesome breweries offer more than just one option from the two... And $5.50 pints ($5 was the \"special\") C'MON!!!  As a stickler for good beer, and being in this neighborhood, try a little harder!  Now my bashing is over back to positives, they mixed drink selection is pretty good, wife always gets margarita and still hasn't had a repeat flavor as the variety is big.  They don't seem to skimp on the booze and she always says they taste solid.   This and cowfish are also our two favorite places to take friends from out of town looking for something different.  Great place always a good time, enjoy the food, fun, but maybe just a tad over-rated for me.  Will be back, would always recommend"}
{"text":"Great spot, good service, food and drinks. Waiters are attentive and food comes out quick. Not a fan of the fish tacos but that's just my preference. The margaritas are on point tho!"}
{"text":"Good margaritas, tacos were decent. But most of the other things we ordered were under seasoned"}
{"text":"Probably the #1 thing I miss about living in Charlotte! I always get the BBQ Mahi taco and the Salmon. Both are fresh and unique. Also the beans and rice are average, but the pasta salad is an excellent side to cool down some of the heat! Great atmosphere, but a little loud at night. Don't go for dinner on a weekend unless you are okay with a 1-2 hour wait, but you can get your name on the list and walk around NoDa until they text you to come back!"}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco is one of my personal favs in Charlotte (and I'm  a former restaurant co-owner and native Charlottean).  Been going for years and it's hard for me not to get the same thing every time...Cabo's signature tacos with beer battered white fish:  two flour tortillas stuffed with cabbage, tomato, avocado, mixed cheeses, & finished with their white cilantro sauce.  And I'm not even much of a seafood eater.  Back in the day the thought of eating a fish taco would have grossed me out.  But going to Cabo in Noda is a different experience that everyone in Charlotte should try at least once, seafood lover or not...."}
{"text":"Passing through NoDa we decided to try this restaurant because it was on diners, drive ins and dives on the food network. The food was great we all got different taco plates each of which was amazing. If it's your first time I would recommend the honey soy glazed salmon tacos, perfect flavor of sweet in combination with seafood that's not to fishy. I would've given the place 5 stars if it wasn't for the lack of good margarita choices. All of their margaritas are pre-made with heavy amounts of sour mix. Food 5 stars drinks 3 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Best fish tacos I've ever had! Shrimp taco was good too and I dream about the Avocado salad!"}
{"text":"I'm a fish taco junkie and this place is my Graceland! I haven't tried the majority of the menu because they always have multiple daily specials and it's hard to pass them up. I usually sit at the bar which has a great selection of brews and an always pleasant tender which adds to the laid back vibe!"}
{"text":"Very interesting concept. Good fish tacos for this Cal-Mex place. While it wasn't in the menu, they were able to serve me a Michelada w my tacos."}
{"text":"BBQ Mahi tacos are the best (when served hot). Service is always great. I have visited Cabo a handful of times and about half of the time my food has come out luke-warm or cold. This usually occurred during their busiest hours. I got tacos to go late one night and they were the best I have had out of Cabo. I guess the secret is to go during off-peak hours."}
{"text":"I am not a seafood fan at all. The only time I eat it is when I am by the coast and that is out of obligation.  That being said, when someone decided we should go to a place that serves fish tacos, I could think of nothing more disgusting. But because I am always willing to try a restaurant's staple dish, I bravely tried a mahi mahi fish taco.  I don't get surprised by non-desert foods a lot, but wow!! I loved it! In fact, for the next several days I actually had fish taco cravings. Since that experience I have been to a few places where they recommended their fish taco, hoping to satisfy the craving I would eat them but they were horrible compared to Cabo Fish Taco.  I have now been back several times and have even guided a few friends into trying a fish taco. I still don't eat seafood but love these fish tacos. The complimentary homemade salsa is really good too.  Word to the wise though, if you have a group bigger than four people, show up really early or plan on a wait. They don't take reservations. And only have a few places that seat bigger parties."}
{"text":"Totally diggin the vibe of this place! When you walk in you have left Charlotte and been transported to a small Cabo beach taco stand with reggae playing the soundtrack in the background and you are instantly relaxed!   My guy and I went the other day and sat at the bar and got started with margaritas while looking over the menu. We had a super sweet bartender that made some great suggestions for not just the drinks but the tacos as well and with so many options to choose from it was much appreciated. I had tuna tacos and my love had the crispy tofu which he must have really liked because they were gone in minutes. Both kinds were amazing and I love their roasted corn salsa they bring to you it's so fresh and different from other places that bring you the staple chips and salsa to start it was nice to have something new. The service was amazing as I had ordered the wrong tuna tacos and just based off a question I asked (as I had no idea I got the wrong ones which was my fault) the bartender not only let me keep the ones I had but insisted on bringing me the other ones as well! Such great service!   There is plenty of indoor seating as well as a small outside area which is great when the weather is nice. Parking is easy there are street spots as well as at night you can park in the ymca lot down a few blocks.   Overall a great spot for any occasion you gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"I am a Californian and have great Latin American/Mexican cuisine everywhere I go in the Los Angeles County and beyond.  The East Coast just can't compete.  This place is a great place to eat if you are craving Mexican and have no alternatives.  Otherwise, I'd suggest you skip it and enjoy classic Southern Soul food."}
{"text":"What a strange place. My parents first time visiting us in our new city we decided to come here for lunch. I won't be reviewing the food as I didn't even eat there. I gave my name and phone #. I was given the instruction to come when I got a text that my table was ready. We came in, We stood there like fools while everyone else that came In was being seated and we felt invisible. 4 tables for our size party were open. As I turned to my husband to tell him \"let's leave\" the male standing by the hostess proceeds to yank the menus out of our hands, and then proceeded to escort us out with his body, what the hell?!!  I felt so disrespected and insulted, he then decided to yell at us telling us we were in the wrong. For what? For doing what we were told? We left so confused.  We took our business to Sabor right next door and had a great lunch."}
{"text":"I used to be in love with Cabo Fish Taco. Over the last couple of years though, I've become disillusioned.  It is way too loud inside, you can barely hear yourself think. I always chose patio seating instead.  The chips are very thick, it's kind of awkward. The corn salsa is delicious though. My last visit we added the salsa verde and it was so salty we could only have a bite of it.  The tacos are okay, they seem to have lost flavor over time.  Out of previous positive experiences, I'm not going to write Cabo off, but it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. My chicken taco  was so dry that a knife couldn't even cut it. It's easy to tell that it was chicken reheated from the previous day, and not properly reheated. Fish tacos were the same. We hardly ate any of our food. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you're in NoDa and want some good Mexican food, you MUST go to Cabo. I am so obsessed with their Tavarua Tuna Tacos. They use this amazing sauce I have never had before, wasabi sauce and it gives the taco a huge punch in flavor.   They also have this amazing spicy avocado pasta salad that is to die for"}
{"text":"I can not, for the life of me figure out how/why Food Network came to this hole. I live within walking distance, and you couldn't pay me to eat here again. Tortillas are cold and chewy, STALE chips, nasty wanna be \"real\" salsa.  Fish tacos have no taste, shrimp tacos came out ice cold. They make you wait forever, service is meh..... Overall, I can't figure out how this place has stayed in business for so long. Maybe because it has become a \"hip spot\" for those without taste buds."}
{"text":"I was sadly underwhelmed by Cabo last night after hearing only good things around town for the last few years I've lived here. We arrived around 6:30 on a Friday night. Our hostess and waitress were very friendly. I ordered a margarita and it was okay. The chips we received were cold and tasted a little old. I ordered the blackened mahi tacos. I appreciated that the tortillas were fried and the flavors were good, but my tacos were pretty cold (not just room temperature but cold to the touch). I feel bad now I didn't say anything to the waitress. The fish tasted like it had been cooked a long while ago and our food came out quickly which is a little disheartening. Even though I loved the vibes and our waitress did nothing wrong I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The complementary chips were a good surprise. The taco, however, was only average. I got the mahi mahi taco and it tasted bland. If I had some BBQ sauce I'd put it on. Service was very good though."}
{"text":"Wow what an great experience! Fish and shrimp tacos are spot on, queso dip was superb. My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is the salsa sucks! Skip the salsa, grab the queso dip instead and you will be fine. Highly recommend this place, worth the drive and won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives fan from the Food network channel which brings me to this place. I've never tried a fish taco until I came here and fell in love! I've tried almost ever taco combination on the menu and its like my 1st time, everythime. Great atmosphere, local art, local beer, and great vibes. I have yet to find a better fish taco anywhere else. Noda Charlotte, NC"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte visiting some friends that brought me here to try the fish tacos on a Saturday morning. We walked in 30 minutes after they opened so wer were immediately sat at a table. I was told that they get super busy pretty early and it last most of the day.  They brough complimentary chips & salsa and the salsa was obviously homemade with lots of flavor. We ordered queso that was also good. I ordered 2 tuna tacos (1 Tavarua Taco & 1 BBQ Mahi Taco). Both were great but the Tavarua was just plain nuts. It has honey wasabi sauce and I'm a big fan of wasabi. I know they've gotten sub-par reviews but my visit was really good. I'll look to visit again the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've not been crazy about my last few visits to Cabo Fish Taco. The food is still good, but the servers keep getting grouchier and grouchier. The last few times I was there, it wasn't very busy, but our server was inaccessible and grouchy. Boo."}
{"text":"Great experience last night at Cabo Fish Taco. The spicy avocado pasta salad was very good and complimented my tuna tacos well. The bartender did a great job explaining the menu and her service was excellent. I'd recommend this spot for anyone looking for great food and a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"The tacos were huge! A meal is typically around 12 bucks or so but they are worth it! I had the steak and fish tacos ! They both had plenty or protein in them.   The seasoning was also good and their complimentary salsa can be a bit in the spicy side but also very good"}
{"text":"The mahi tacos are delicious, the sides are fresh, and the atmosphere is awesome! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere make for a great night.  My wife and I were there this weekend and were more than pleaded. We each had the fish tacos and were both very pleased.  Service was good and they had dos equis lager on tap...Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Me and my friends went last night my food was great. I had the the honey glazed salmon tacos and they were amazing . The down sides were where we sat was very cold and there was a wait."}
{"text":"Was in town for business, staying downtown and heard NoDa was a good area to grab dinner. There was a 20 minute wait around 7pm but I was by myself so I was able to eat at the bar right away. I had the beer battered shrimp tacos and they were very good. The flour tortillas were crispy yet soft at the same time and everything tasted fresh.  Very affordable, quick and tasty."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've had, blackened mahi mahi, just right amount of heat. Service was great, server was friendly and knowledgeable on the food and beer.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Seriously guys, why is the fish SO DRY AND BLAND.   I really, really want to like this place. I mean, Cabo Fish Taco - I love Baja California and I LOVE LOVE fish tacos (favorite food, for real, look at my profile). And it's in my hood among other places I frequent. Part of me thinks I'm just being a fish taco snob, but several visits and outside sources have confirmed my original conclusion, this place has terrible fish tacos.  Please remedy this situation. I want to like you, so much, just learn how to grill fish."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere.  Food is outstanding.  The tacos and the corn salsa can't be beat."}
{"text":"Cold chips they say they do not make them to order  This place is terrible where did they get the fish? Did not look like any fish that I have ever had. It was so bad I took two bites and left . First what is Cabo about it? and what is fish about it?It takes more than a few pieces of frozen fish on a tortilla shell. Lets see if Taco Bell can do better ?Guy you must have been drunk if you liked this place of course I have never seen him visit a place that he said he did not like?  No No No I should have contacted my credit card company and disputed the charge. What a waste..."}
{"text":"Food and service is amazing! Period! The fajitas -'d the crab and shrimp dip is off the charts!"}
{"text":"WOW this place's food is DELICIOUS. I had shrimp tacos with a jalapeno & cheese mashed potatoes. DELICIOUS. The salsa seems more authentic than the typical American style with less liquid sauce and more chunks of tomato & other veggies. DELICIOUS. Service is average. We were originally going to Crepes Cellar but they were closed on Mondays (didn't know) so we went across the street. 10:35pm (close at 11) and the staff let us in to eat. (Points from me!) And the place still had a good number of people! Good for a casual meal with friends and family. Definitely worth a visit or two or several."}
{"text":"This place use to be on our short list of regular places to visit. The shrimp tacos and mexi-slaw were worth waiting for.  I hadn't been in a few years until yesterday, when I decided I had been going without Cabo for long enough!   It was quite chilly outside, so when the hostess sat us at a table directly in front of the door, I asked that we be moved into the \"bar\" room. She hesitated and said service would take a while if we moved, even though I could see several empty tables. We agreed to stay right in front of the door. It was cold. When other guests walked in they tended to leave the door open, and the hostess was rarely there to close it, so that wasn't very comfy.  The hostess never smiled, and often rolled her eyes at the backs of other guests, and once at a crying baby. That was a turn off. They couldn't see her, but we could.   I got my usual shrimp tacos and slaw. The shells to the tacos had been very lightly fried, but were greasy and tasted of old oil. The slaw has changed. Not as much flavor and the spicy seeds they put on it were missing (that was the best part!)  My son got the $6.96 shrimp burrito from the kids menu. He got a side of Baja Rice. It would have been nice if the server had told us the burrito was already filled with Baja Rice, which was described as having chutney on it, but that must have been missing too. So the not-so-good rice and burrito were left with one bite out of each.   My daughter got the lemon seared shrimp tacos. Basically bait shrimp with lemon seasoning on it. She asked for the fresh fruit option as a side, but they didn't have any, so she got the veggie medley, which I ate. She picked the shrimp out and ate them solo.   My husband got swordfish tacos (maybe burritos?) and mexi-slaw. He LOVED the swordfish, but even as an avid slaw lover (and just all around food lover!), he left his slaw to the trash.    On a side note, our server was nice. The vegetable medley was really tasty, and I wish I would have just gotten a huge bowl of that!   Not sure we will be back, which makes me sad. This was my go-to recommendation for any new comers to Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is our second trip to Charlotte and the first to this very cool area of the City.  Lots of renovated old brick buildings; a very cool vibe.  Cabo Fish Taco is a located in an old pharmacy building.  Fair sized bar in the back but mostly tables for dinner.  The wait staff is friendly and relaxed but very attentive.  And the food.  I had the signature BBQ fish taco.  Fish perfectly cooked, the spicy and sweet seasoning just enough to compliment the fish.  I actually found myself slowing down so that I wouldnt finish too quickly.  The bar has a good selection of microbrews.  Overall, this is a big win for the area.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I genuinely love coming here every time I can make it to Charlotte.  The restaurant is nestled squarely in an eclectic and laid-back arts district on the outskirts of Charlotte proper.  Their beer selection is always one of the best in the area and they always feature local and NC breweries. No-Da and Birdsong brewing are just a few blocks away from Cabo.   Their menu selections area always packed with a wide variety of fish tacos, burritos and their new tortilla cornucopia bowl. Some excellent flavor combinations that will appease your fish taco cravings. The staff is always pleasant to talk with and the bartenders very knowledgeable about the beer selections on tap. Don't skip this place if you're on the East side of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Visited Cabo for lunch on a business trip.  Nice presentation, but disappointing flavor.  I probably wouldn't go back...  I'm surprised that stay in business in the trendy NoDa district."}
{"text":"I only go here on NON gallery crawl nights...the fish tacos are perfection with mexi-slaw and a margarita   The staff is hip and attentive.  The only thing I wish I could change about this place is the corn salsa that comes with the chips.  Prices are excellent and I love the new addition!"}
{"text":"YES YES YES!! Innovative Mexican food is always worth a try and cabo did not disappoint. They have a yummy corn salsa that they serve with their chips and salsa. (To be honest it is delicious, but I'd love to see it paired with a tomato based salsa too.)   I ordered the blackened chicken and shrimp burrito. The meat and shrimp were cooked to perfection all wrapped up in a perfectly cooked tortilla. YUM! In addition to that they have some unique sides. I really liked my spicy avocado pasta salad. Everything at our table was delicious and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The last time I ate at Cabo Fish Taco was probably 2007 or 2008. There must have bene a major management shift because after eating there tonight, I would never return again. The server was way too laid back and paid no attention to us at all. The chips and salsa are bland - ordered some cheese dip to kick it up, and the cheese dip was just hard, melted velveeta. We ordered the steak and fish tacos. Both were mediocre, at best. I had the mexi slaw, which was nothing to write home about and my husband had the jalepeno-chedder mashed potatoes which were cold and just plain awful. Our beers were VERY over priced as well. Overall, I will never go back there again. It's a shame, because a few years ago, I remember it tasting much better. Perhaps being on a food network show got to their heads because the quality has gone WAY downhill. Ugh."}
{"text":"It's good! I feel like it's kind of hyped up. They have a good menu for seafood lovers, but i wish there were more chicken options lol. I know it's Cabo \"Fish\" Taco, but they usually have to have at least some options with chicken. And they have a lot of spicy stuff. So if you are picky like me, don't go here if you don't like spicy or fish!"}
{"text":"Frozen guacamole. It may have been fresh at one point, but not when we got it, had ice crystals. Unappetizing. Odd presentation too, was it scooped with a disher like lunch lady mashed potatoes.   Tacos were fine. Not remarkable.   This place would not survive on the west coast."}
{"text":"Whoa! I've never gotten food this fast before EVER! And it was really good too! I'll definitely be back. The menu has a variety of Mexican options many of which are not just your standard options. It was great :-)"}
{"text":"EPIC TUNA BURRITO.  The name says it all.  But, if you must hear a few more to back up the claim, here are a few: GRILLED YELLOW FIN TUNA WRAPPED WITH BLACK BEANS, RICE, AVOCADO, ROASTED RED PEPPERS MIXED CHEESES & OUR WHITE CILANTRO SAUCE.  Hubs and I visited this past weekend  for lunch while seeing friends that live in Charlotte.  They suggested this location as a great place for us to see the art district while having some good options for us all (three omnivores and one mostly-pescatarian)  The chips brought out were okay, but the salsa was really good, as well as the guacamole we ordered for the table.  We were seated at the big booth in the front, so it was cool to hear the bustle of the restaurant, but still quiet enough to have some good convo.  We all loved the food - me especially!   But the portions are SOOO big.  I ate just half and hubs happily finished mine after he ate his BBQ mahi tacos which he loved as well.    BIG BIG YUM!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Cabo Fish Taco that hasn't already been said.... It's a gem in NoDa! With good and fast service, the place always has a line... and it's not small.  Chips and salsa are always fresh! My favorite dish there is the Blackened Mahi, it feels like you just stepped onto Baja California and took a bite! I wouldn't normally be full with two tacos, but they fill them to the brim, and most people need a fork to scoop up all the goodness after the shell is gone.   I'm always game is anyone of my friends wants to go here..."}
{"text":"Just a forewarning the lines at the Cabo can be a bit long Friday and Saturday night. That being said its worth the wait and the buzzer they give you reaches across the street to the shops if your looking to blow some time.  Once your seated the chips and dip are amazing and the service is great. I will however warn you that you may have to seek professional help after taking that first bite. If your anything like me you may become a Fishoholic. Night flashes, shakes, panic attacks. I guess it all depends on how well you can handle a taste of heaven on earth."}
{"text":"Food is decent but the wait is horrible and the staff attitude is smug \"we don't care if you leave because 30 more suckers are lined up outside\".  Choose elsewhere."}
{"text":"Whoa, how have I not reviewed CFT yet?  Okay first, the wait: To address all these reviews that talk about waiting to be seated - yes, you usually have to wait for a table. Yes, there isn't really a good area to sit and wait. But yes, it is worth it. When you're coming to a restaurant this delicious, you'll probably have to wait.  The food: I'm not a huge fan of the chips and salsa, but most people I go with love them. I've had the BBQ Mahi Tacos (about 6 times). They are amazing. The tortillas are fried and the slaw is incredible. I usually get full after the first one, which says a lot because I can usually house my meals, but always make room for the second taco. The sides? Nothing great. Some of my friends love the jalapeno-cheddar mashers. I usually pay the up-charge to get a side salad, which is delicious, but the tacos are good enough that the lack of yummy sides doesn't really matter. The Guacamole Salmon Salad is also incredible.  Great beer selection. Decent margaritas. The prices can't be beaten. I love NoDa and I love Cabo Fish Taco."}
{"text":"* Hipster hangouts don't impress me in the least. And I'm sure not paying you extra for atmosphere. You can style and profile all that you want, but I want to eat some delicious food when I go to a restaurant. I do like the Goth girls, but then.....I always find stupidity amusing.   * Flavorless whitefish tacos. There are literally dozens of Hispanic restaurants, featuring superior fish tacos, in and around CLT.   * Weird Cold Corn Salsa with Stale \"Cardboard\" Blue Corn Tortillas. Creative? Yes. Tasty? Mmmm, No. Give me chunky, freshly made at one's tableside, pico de gallo guacamole any day of the week and twice on Sunday. (Served with hot tortilla chips, which doesn't happen here!)  * Difficult parking. YMCA parking lot, and we're walking there.   * Expensive. There's no reason for fish tacos to cost this much, and to be so effing mediocre. If the fish were freshly caught that morning off the coast of Charleston, or served somewhere along the PCH, yeah, maybe I could see their prices as realistic. Here, you're just paying for the cool factor of dining in NODA, and screw that.  ** Their location nets one star, and they usually have competent waitstaff, which procures the second star.   PS: I like Guy Fieri, but he's not always right."}
{"text":"I stopped in Cabo fish taco for the second time ever and was again really impressed by the food. Cabo has a very unassuming environment. This place is casual, with a nice outdoor seating area, open via a garage door. The menu is full of margaritas, burritos, tacos, and drink specials. They have regular specials on Tecate and PBR, as well as food specials.  As far as the food goes, the standard salsa they bring is a corn and tomato based salsa that I really enjoyed. Unfortunately, the chips were slightly stale, but the salsa itself was solid. I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos and loved them. They have a nice aioli and the tortilla is buttery.   Given this place's spot on triple d, I was worried about commercialism the first time I visited, but I've been overall impressed by the food both times. Not a bad spot for casual drinks and good food."}
{"text":"Went here after many recommendations and it was great. The restaurant itself is bigger than I expected and they were able to seat my party of 8 pretty much immediately despite being busy. We were greeted immediately and the waitress made good recommendations. I grabbed a margarita beer, which had a slightly sour after-tone as expected.    For food I ordered the bbq Maui Maui and the honey soy salmon fish tacos with the baja rice as a side. The baja rice was ok, nothing memorable but both of the tacos were super flavorful and delicious. I can see why this place was on food network. This place adds to the many great places to eat in the NODA area in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time - and when that time came, I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is fun and everyone around us seemed to be having a good time!   Ordered the blackened Mahi-Mahi and Tavarua fish tacos, and they were great and a lot bigger than I expected! The Tavarua's wasabi glaze was a little stronger than both my friend and I expected though. The corn salsa was a little bland and we quickly swapped it out for some queso.   Service was a little slow, especially after that wasabi glaze hit and we needed water. But besides that, definitely wouldn't mind bringing old and new friends back to eat!"}
{"text":"Food is good. I always get the Epic Tuna Burrito.  The Tuna is Sushi Grade just so you know.  Everything is good at Cabos."}
{"text":"Goto place for tacos in Charlotte!  My favorite is the Epic Tuna Burrito! Yum!!! Also love the neighborhood for wandering.  A great choice all around!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to have some tex-mex nom noms. The corn salsa is pretty solid and I have yet to go wrong ordering different things off the menu. Obviously the fish tacos are a signature item, the carne asada wraps/tacos are damn good too. For the side I'm a fan of the jalapeno mashed potatoes \"mashers\". Atmosphere is very casual and laid back, this place is in the heart of NoDa (art district) so don't be surprised when your waitress named Cobra comes to your table tatted up and in hipster attire, because they all still provide great service. I'd recommend this place to anyone. It does have a tendency to fill up so whether you're doing lunch or dinner you may want to leave a few minutes early."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a night out with friends. Parking pretty difficult but there is a cash lot nearby if you can't score free street parking. Tacos are large and filling (2 were plenty). Jalapeño mashed potatoes (which they don't have year around) were delicious but honestly all their other sides are just mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Like everyone else's post, this place is great. Try as I might, I could not find a thing to complain about. Food was great, service was great, drinks were great.  If I had to pick one thing to complain about, it would be parking, that NoDo area has limited parking. And with all the construction going on, it made it even harder. This was my first time to the NoDo area,  That said, I am definitely coming back. Thank you Cabo Fish taco."}
{"text":"Definitely an awesome choice! We had the crab and shrimp dip with fried pita and it was heavenly! Portions were great too. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos and they were delicious. It came with two very full tacos and a side of black beans and rice.  They had the doors open to the patio and our group of 5 arrived right before the lunch rush. Once the place started to fill up, it started to get loud. Honestly though, what place wouldn't get loud when it fills up? The noise level wouldn't deter me from coming back - the food was TOO GOOD."}
{"text":"I have to say, these fish tacos are mighty good.    I was reading an article in Charlotte's edition of Creative Loafing and the writer mentioned ordering two specific tacos which he found to be delightful. Having lived most of my life near the coast, I have a rule about eating seafood so far inland. Yet, I've heard nothing but good things about this restaurant and I was literally a block away..so how could I resist?  I ordered a BBQ Mahi taco, which I'm told was featured on 'Diner's, Drive In and Dives.'  The fish wasn't as fresh as it would be at a beachfront taco stand and the sauce was a tad sweet for me, but that was nothing a little hot sauce couldn't fix.   I also ordered a Tavaroo Tuna taco, which had a hint of wasabi and was fantastic.   It was early Saturday night and the dining room was filling up quickly, so I sat at the bar and could observe everything coming out of the kitchen..and it all looked delectable.    Nice margarita menu and beer selection too."}
{"text":"Delicious!! The tuna tacos were yum and had a great kick to them. Loved the whole meal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxed, the food is great, the service is family friendly... grab your drink and eat outside, you've made your day go from \"I wish it were Friday to tis feels like a Friday\" when you reach the bottom of your margarita glass."}
{"text":"It was ok. Nothing special maybe a little overhyped. It's really not that hard to make fish tacos at home."}
{"text":"Saw it on Triple D & couldn't wait to try it. Had lunch & the free chips & salsa very good, corn based salsa with a kick. Guacamole was extremely good @ fresh. Has the taco's, one of each, BBQ Mahi Mahi & Tavarua (wahoo) with a drizzled wasabi sauce, unbelievable. The service was right on, got us in @ out while still being very personable."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa please!!!!!!  I love it.  What a great place for my wife and I to walk to whenever we want.  Drink specials and two bars to sit at if you don't want to wait since there is more often times than not a small wait time.  No problem though.  I have a spot in my heart for some fried shrimp and their beer battered shrimp tacos are out of this world!  Very delicious and the shrimp are always huge and tasty.  The jalepeno mashed potatoes are my go to side when they have it since it is not year round.  If you want to test and see how much you can eat, order the shrimp fajitas.  I'm a big feller and it is all I can do to eat that whole thing.  More chips and salsa!!!!!!!  When the weather is nice, the patio seating is pretty cool since you get a chance to see all the characters we have in NoDa.  I am so glad we live very close to this place!"}
{"text":"The restaurant decor was cool, our server was very friendly , food was just ok. This place has been built up and talked about so much in this area that we decided to stop on our way through town. My tofu tacos we ok, slightly bland, the refried beans were good. My boyfriend had the Serrano chicken tacos, he said the flavor was also kindof bland and the chicken was dry, his avocado pasta salad was awesome. Maybe because of all the hype surrounding this restaurant we had our hopes too high. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I had a fish taco craze last year and that was pretty much the only thing I ate for about a month. Still, I am not a self-proclaimed taco connoisseur and will not pretend to know everything there is to know about the dish.   I will tell you that in my short-lived taco-eating career, Cabo Fish Taco definitely tops the list of delicious tacos I've eaten. And I've tried all kinds. Korean bulgogi tacos to Vietnamese pork belly tacos to traditional carne asada tacos.   Seems to me that there are three main components  to the taco:   1) the protein  2) the case (wrap) 3) the garnish  While most of the tacos I've eaten have excelled in 1 and 3, few have been able to come up with an astounding 2 the way Cabo Fish Taco does. I would describe the \"case\" as a crisp soft shell. It's a light and fluffy, doughy bite with a crisp finish (literally). Reminds me of the Indian puri. Then you get this magnificent choice of beef, chicken, blackened mahi-mahi, lemon grilled shrimp...the list goes on of meat to flavor your taco up. Loved the shrimp in particular. Finally they sprinkle on an assortment of sweet, sour, tangy or creamy toppings that are powerful and enticing. Even after you inhale the taco though, you don't feel like a beached whale. You could eat these all day!  They also have some sick margaritas (see photo)  The one area that disappointed me greatly was the quality of the appetizers. Yes the guac is fresh avocado - but unseasoned and plain? The \"queso\" tasted nothing short of Moes Grill's mass-produced queso. They could've tried harder on the easy parts!  4/5"}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 3 years . Found this place by accident and keep coming back and bringing friends everytime  I come to town . Service is friendly and attentive , food is always fresh and tasty! Margaritas are also always on point , they have lots of flavors. This place never disappoints !!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the food here. I've been twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. Both time received excellent quality food. I ordered the CARNE ASADA WRAPGrilled steak sautéed in a roasted red tomato sauce with peppers and onions wrapped with refried beans, lettuce, tomato, mixed cheeses, & our southwest mayo. This thing is stuffed and has some girth on it. Its probably in diameter the size of a Monster energy drink can. I could barely finish it. The meat is so tender and juicy and the suace compliments the contents perfectly. I didn't enjoy the Margarita's so much, not saying they were bad, just...different?. I tried 2 different kinds and while the ingredients sounded good, I have to say I'll pass next time and just order a beer. Love the food though!! Definitely go for the food!! I was a little weirded out by the 2 toilets in the bathroom, there are no stalls separating them? So you can either take your pick of seats or possibly take a piss with your girlfriend or boyfriend ;-) in the room with you...if you're comfortable with that."}
{"text":"I don't know, maybe Cabo has just outgrown itself?  It's ok, but not spectacular.  The first time we went (2010), it was fantastic.  It was a Saturday night, it was packed, it was delicious.  We then talked often about how we couldn't wait to go back when we were in Charlotte again.  We went last week while in town for a concert and it just wasn't the same.  This time, we went on a weekday afternoon around lunchtime.  The corn salad stuff they brought out kinda looked like it had been sitting around for a while and the chips tasted stale.   I ordered the battered fish tacos and hubs ordered the carne asada.  The tortillas had the texture you get when you nuke them for too long - rubbery - and rubbery tortillas sincerely bum me out, man.  The carne and the fish were good, though, I could've eaten those elements all day.  I had rice and beans on the side, which was terrible, but hubs had pasta salad, which was really good.  It has its ups and downs now, I suppose.  Good service and cool atmosphere, though."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, unique vibe, cool people, tacos were on point not to hard but not to soft, the guacamole salmon casa salad was a big hit for me. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"In my opinion, if you are a specialty taco spot and don't offer Home mad tortillas, you aren't a real taco spot! This place has homemade tortillas and the best steak tacos I've ever had! I had 1 steak taco and 1 shrimp taco and I devoured them both! The flavors of each taco are soooo different yet sooo delicious. If you come to the Noda area, be sure to stop here and grab a taco or three!"}
{"text":"This place has super tasty food and a lively, fun atmosphere.  Situated in the eclectic, artsy NoDa neighborhood of Charlotte, Cabo Fish Taco offers plenty of Southern CA/Baja style dishes, all prepared with lots of flavor and freshness.  We were told their fish taco specials are offered based on fresh selections so we tried the calamari tacos and rare tuna tacos (neither on the printed menu).  Both were extremely good, each with a unique sauce to compliment.  Their side dishes are loaded with flavor and make sure to order one of Charlotte's local brews...they offer several!!  In addition to a dining area, they have outdoor seating (draped and heated in the colder months) and a large bar.  Just be aware that sitting near the front door can be a little drafty on a cold night."}
{"text":"The fried fish taco was good. I thought it would be better. The homemade salsa was OK. Very fresh though. The jalapeno marg was pretty good but not worth $9.  The avocado pasta side was the best part. And I did like the tortilla."}
{"text":"We met a fee friends here for lunch,  it was the first time we ventured into what's called \"NODA\", glad I brought my concealed weapon,  just kidding,  it is a very artsy area with some cool places to go.  Cabo Fish Taco was a very nice little food joint with some really interesting entrees.   It was a while ago but I remember enjoying the food and sitting and being able to see the view of the neighborhood as well.  Service was relatively quick and tentative.   Definitely recommend checking it out if your in the NODA zone.  Felt a little like Greenwich Village,  NY."}
{"text":"Well I finally made it out to Cabo Fish Taco and I must say I left with a sense of maybe this place is overrated.  I mean I don't want to be too harsh because all aspects were great but great in conjunction with any other mexican restaurant.  I know I may need to try some other dishes and I will eventually but for now I'm not jumping for joy for this place.  The interiors aren't anything to get crazy about, very NoDa, shabby chic like most business in the area.  Not a bad thing, just is what it is.  Our waitress was gracious and pleasant and kept up with our needs very well."}
{"text":"For my first fish taco experience, I have to say I'm impressed. I had the pleasure of devouring the bbq mahi taco with the creamy cilantro sauce. My husband had the chicken quesadillas(which was also awesome) Music was great. The setting was nice. Music was Parking not so nice. We were lucky to snag a spot nearby but if it was any busier, we would have been SOL. But we enjoyed the experience and we will be back :)"}
{"text":"Cabo! You blessed my belly yet again! Tonight I enjoyed two delightful vegan options. I knew Cabo Fish Taco offered their sweet and sour tofu, but as I've been exploring more vegan options in my food choices I asked the server if they had any other options available. She said they could create me a grilled veggie taco with no cheese. So I told her I would do the choose two with the tofu taco, and black beans and rice. To my Veggies and Vegis thE GRILLED VEGGIE TACO WAS INCREDIBLE honestly it was better than the tofu and something that should be offered on the menu! Great healthy fats, protein proportions and very filling, I even had left overs. Highly recommend this dish, check out my latest photo if you need proof of the yummy goodness."}
{"text":"Worth the visit!  Go for  the  BBQ  Mahi Tacos.  Mine where loaded so it made the price for two wort it.  Had to finish with a fork it was so loaded.  It rivals Fish tacos from the west coast.  Vickie was a great host serving at the bar making great local Tap recommendations.  Next time I am in town I will definitely be eating there again.  It only gets loader as more guest come  in so go around 5:30 before the rush and you will be fine."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best place in Charlotte (in my opinion).  I have heard others say Crazy Fish is also very good, but if you're like me and you like a cool vibe atmosphere, amazing tacos, and incredible margaritas-this too will become your #1 favorite place in the Queen City!  Always busy, but just get there early and have a margarita or a beer and people watch in NoDa."}
{"text":"The tacos are awesome!!!  Full of rich flavors.  Highly recommend the place.  Best cal tacos in town.  They also have outstanding service."}
{"text":"Nice casual dining place in the heart of NoDa. This place was a fun down to earth feel. As soon as we walked in on a busy Friday night they found seats for us. Staff were pleasant and the drinks were good. The food was great. I had the taco option. It's not listed on the menu but you can pick two different flavors. I got the chicken and the beer battered cod. The cod was my favorite. As a side option I got the brand and rice. The black beans come over the rice with a bit of cheese as a topper. I felt the portions were pretty good and filling. If in the area I may come back."}
{"text":"Came her on Father's Day with the family. Service was quick. Food was fast and fresh. Wonderful atmosphere. My family enjoyed it and will visit again when they return. The salmon was cooked perfect and not dry. The jerk chicken and shrimp was good and spicy. The 2 tacos were very filling and the shells were thicker than your traditional she'll."}
{"text":"Another great visit to Cabo!  Their special today was fried crawfish taco's that were awesome.  I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"Tacos are the quintessential millennial go-to food. This place doesn't just do them but does them well. Let me start with the positives.   First, the food is made from high quality ingredients. The chefs pay close attention to flavor profiles and ensure that the tacos taste amazing! I ordered the BBQ magi tacos and the shrimp &a crab dip. I wasn't disappointed. The tacos and fish were cooked to perfection. The dip was good. The pitas that are served along with the dip are amazing!   Now on to my area of suggested growth...the place is small and has a huge following. Prepare to wait for lengthy times. On the other hand, they use the No Wait app so when you check in they communicate to you clearly and efficiently. Our food took a very long time to arrive. The hostess stated that the kitchen was really behind. We waited for close to an hour. The staff is friendly but the wait almost made it not worth the trip. My brother, friends and I were agitated but had a quick mood change when the food arrived because of how good it was.   Overall, the place is great. They should consider opening another location or moving to a larger place."}
{"text":"so has anyone been to Cabo Fish Tacos. I went for the first time and it was so good the only thing was i had to wait for 20 mints for a drink because they couldn't find the bladder wow. but other then that the tacos are great and the salsa was not very good I'm not a fan of that  well i hope everyone will try this place it is very good"}
{"text":"Kid friendly environment, noisy atmosphere & great service. Love that the salsa was fresh chunks of tomatoes & corn. The chips were a bit hard & thick. Avocado pasta salad was delicious- definitely order it again.  Tofu tacos were perfect. My 5yr old liked her shrimp kids meal. Beer batter white fish was heaven for your mouth....moist fish with oh so good batter.  Plenty of seats inside or outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Food is awesome!  Beer options awesome. Wine selection SUCKS!  We live in the neighborhood and really enjoy coming here BUT I unfortunately can't drink beer for health reasons.  We would come a lot not often if they had a better wine selection. Hint Cabo owners start to lol at: Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanchard, Matua Sauvignon Blanchard, J Lohr. Cab, Meoimi Pinot...you get the point. Anything that isn't your current rot gut wine menu.  By the way KW is an awesome server. Please get a better wine list and we will come every week!  Food is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is very average as are the margaritas. Service is hit or miss. Some of the staff are rude. I have given this place several chances and I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty! They have a ride range of food on their menu for a taco place, a lot to choose from. Loved it."}
{"text":"Lunch today, first time dining there. Waiter was quite helpful. When I ordered the tuna tacos, he offered the recommendation for their house specialty then went on to tell me I could order one of each since there are two on the plate. I did and it was a great way to try different flavors. Both tacos had abundant large pieces of tuna cooked to the medium rare I requested. Waiter kept the ice tea coming.  Really nice lunch!"}
{"text":"BBQ Mahi and tavaroo is the way to go! The honey wasabi is amazing.. The queso is excellent, the tortillas are home made and perfection.. I wish we had one in Raleigh!"}
{"text":"Yummo. Simple, good, fresh food. The flavors speak for themself- which is good b/c this place is crazy packed so it can be hard to hear what anyone has to say. The beer battered fish tacos are light and remind me of SoCal. Big chunks of flakey, moist white fish cooked to crispy perfection on the outside.  Ask for extra white cilantro sauce, it is just so damn good on everything!   My dining companion, a fellow foodie, did the nirvana eye-roll upon tasting her shrimp tacos. The menu has a great variety but isn't too big; there are just enough choices that everyone should be able to find something to enjoy. I can't wait to try the carne asada. The staff is friendly, laid back and accomodating. I asked for a side of their corn relish (in my opinion it's more a relish than salsa) and was given a large container. SCORE! This stuff alone is worth the visit. It is made in house and it has a sweet undertone that hits the tastebuds in all the right spots. One way I judge a mexican joint by the refried beans and this place has the best I've tasted in a looong time. They make their own, add lotsa of spice and a tiny kick, topped w/a touch of shredded cheddar and oodles of green onions - I could eat a whole bowl w/chips. Dangerous!  We had a 30 minute wait when we arrived on a Friday night around 8:30 so we were encouraged to visit one of two bars or check out the local galleries. We did both and enjoyed both. Had the weather cooperated, I doubt our wait would've been more than 20min as more people could've used the patio. Either way, I will gladly return and wouldn't mind another 30 minute wait. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Really good salsa. Guac was just okay. Rasta Pasta was great and the portion was huge! Split it with my sister and neither of us could finish our half."}
{"text":"Hmmm... I wanted to like Cabo so much! But sadly, my sister and I's visit on Friday night fell short from the get go, but wasn't a Pompei-esque meltdown either.  I believe the sour taste started as we waited about 2-3 minutes for anyone to notice us standing at the \"wait to be seated\" sign, despite the place being 3/4 empty.   When we got seated, it was obvious our poor waitress was having an off night for whatever reason, but she dropped some chips and \"salsa?\" with us, and took our orders in a decent time frame so all was well with me. Now the \"salsa\" is DUMB. Lacking in flavor, tomatoes and spice, this is basically a cup of corn with a few diced tomatoes and some parsley on top. At least that's what it tasted like. Seriously, bring me some damn salsa, none of this corny junk. Turns out though, if you want some salsa, cough up $3.95 and expect it to be green. :'( Not cool, IMO!  I got the BBQ Mahi Mahi tacos and it was moist and a good portion, but the white sauce everyone is commenting left me asking \"where is it?\". I mean, it was definitely on there but I couldn't taste a thing. Sad day. My sister chose the steak wrap and she didn't say a word from first bite to last and that says it all! :D  As sides, she got black beans and rice which she didn't eat much of, and I tried the jalepeno mashers which are basically chunky mashed potatoes with diced jalepenos and unmelted cheese on top. Weak attempt at a side, guys. Get with it.  For $20, it was ok but I won't be rushing back soon."}
{"text":"My friends in Charlotte raved about Cabo Fish Tacos and finally got a chance to try and boy was I surprised how good it was! It's really large and loud inside, and parking was hard to find so we had to pay for a spot nearby.   Although I had been on a taco kick the past few days before, I knew I had to try their staple. Our server was super sweet, wish I caught her name, and helped me choose my tacos. Originally I was leaning towards the fried tacos because fried food is always better, but she told me her favorites were the lemon grilled shrimp tacos and the honey soy glazed salmon tacos. I was hesitant about the sauces, so she said they would be on the side. You also get a choice of a side and I went with the spicy avocado pasta salad. I was hungry.  We munched on the chips and really yummy corn salsa and my glass of wine was delicious as well. When our food came out, the tacos were larger than I had imagined. Unfortunately they forgot to put the sauce on the side, but I liked them both!  The salmon was my absolute favorite, fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was superb. The lemon shrimp were tasty as well, and all the trimmings inside the taco were a perfect combo. The avocado pasta salad reminded me of a pesto pasta but it was really good. I demolished my entire meal to the last bite!  Will be back if I'm ever back in the area! Very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"I don't get why this place comes so highly recommended. This is not authentic food. The pico was the worst I've had in ages. I had the carne asada burrito, which was okay, but lacked any true flavors. The \"salsa\" they serve on the table is absolutely disgusting... the shrimp tacos were probably the most decent thing we had, but again lacked flavor. They need to work on their side items. Rice was dry and crunchy. Pasta tastes like paste. Guacamole tastes like grocery store guac. Their beans were too mushy. Service was spotty, and she was not that friendly or helpful. And for all of that awful - it was suuuuuper over priced.   This place did not live up to its reputation and I will not be one of the crazies who recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been in the NODA area for more than two years now and it never gave this place a try. My loss ! What a great find, my favorite taco place in Charlotte for sure. Better late than never.  They have huge portion sizes which justifies the price. Loved their house made corn and salsa, which is not the usual kind youl get at other places. Even their margaritas are ate fantastic. I ordered the mahi mahi BBQ taco and I got these two giant tacos with almost a pound of fish ! Never have I ever seen this much in a taco. It had the right amount of spice for me and I just loved my food. My girlfriend ordered tofu with Thai chili sauce and even that was good. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"A must try for the No Da area! Eclectic and Artsy casual restaurant with good and great food! Depends on your mood and taste! For me, I have been going here for years and always enjoy what I get, go for Tacos! There is a reason Taco is in the name of the establishment!!!!"}
{"text":"A NoDa institution, Cabo Fish Taco serves up tasty Mexican dishes and outstanding margaritas in a cool, laid-back setting that could easily pass for a beachside bar in Cancun. Stopping by on a recent evening, my wife and I started with a pair of delicious (and potent) Silver Surfer Margaritas, along with a complimentary bowl of crisp tortilla chips and fresh salsa.   For my entree, I ordered the restaurant's signature dish: the wonderfully flavorful BBQ Mahi Tacos. Guy Fieri raved about them on his show, and this recommendation was spot-on. My wife enjoyed the Carne Asada Tacos, which weren't quite as delicious, but still an excellent choice.   Cabo has a fun, family-friendly vibe, and the friendly and prompt service was as good as the cocktails and food. While the restaurant doesn't take reservations, you can put your name down using the NoWait app, or just kill time like we did at one of the many neighborhood watering holes within a short walk. NoDa is one of Charlotte's coolest neighborhoods, and no visit is complete without a stop at Cabo Fish Taco. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Cabo Fish Taco for the past 3 years. I've told friends and family about how awesome it is and every one wants to eat there when they come into town to visit. However, my opinion about Cabo has changed in the last 5 months. The food has became greasy and tasteless. My once favorite shrimp tacos are made up of overcooked shrimp and a greasy a tortilla shell. I just wonder if management has changed or what has happened because it's really disheartening to see such a great restaurant go downhill. I continue going back hoping I've just had bad luck but each new visit doesn't leave me feeling more hopeful."}
{"text":"OMG the tacos are slammin!! Mouth watering and wonderful service - this spot is tucked away in a cute artsy area too - great place and affordable!"}
{"text":"This was probably the most boring meal I have ever had. The $7 guacamole tastes like it came from a a package, the chips were stale and someone went a little crazy with the cinnamon in the salsa and sauces on chicken & shrimp. Margarita tasted like it was a pre-made mix as well. Overall disappointing."}
{"text":"After hearing everyone I run into rave about this place, I just had to check it out!  Parking is tough. After driving around in circles for a while, we finally made it inside. The atmosphere was great for a Saturday night...had to wait a little while for a table so we sat at the bar and had some cokctails - I had the 3 amigos which was pretty good.  Once we sat at our table (about 45 mins later) we started off with the guacamole - it could of used a little more salt, but hey, that's what salt shakers or for.  I then had the carne asada tacos - steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly! My girlfriend had the Mahi Tacos and those were delicious!  For side we black beans & rice as well as the avocado past salad, both very good.  I can't wait to go back try a bunch of other menu items that caught my eye!"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent!!! The service was friendly and very informative. The food was delicious and very large portions!!! Great prices. I will be back the next time we are back in the area."}
{"text":"You wont find better fish tacos in Charlotte. The BBQ Mahi tacos are great as well as the Tuna with Honey Wasabi Sauce. The atmosphere is cool and the specials are usually really good. Did another reviewer actually complain about the price? This is one of the most reasonably priced fish restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Funky layout.....hipster staff.....always hoppin' in some manner, the Cabo is a NoDa anchor.  Fish Tacos are the draw for me and the GF....this time I was only hungry enough for the guac and cheese dip and a few beers.  The outdoor patio has really made this place even better and with temps this last weekend being in the 70s it was perfect."}
{"text":"Cabo is a dope fish spot in one of the eclectic sides of town NODA. Hands down one of the best taco places around. The margaritas are sooo good. Today i had their mule and it was just what i needed on a hot spring evening. The nachos and the chunky salsa is so flavor filled.  I ordered beer battered shrimp tacos and a BBQ mahi fish taco. With in a few minutes of ordering our food came out and was everything I expected and more. We sat in their new add on and it was so nice and exciting to see they have more space to sit. I enjoy this place every time I come."}
{"text":"I love the Noda feel of this place and the beer battered shrimp tacos are great but the service is always up in the air. If the service was good and the wait staff acted like they cared if you were even in the restaurant, I'd for sure rate it higher. I've eaten here a lot and the service has been consistently below average."}
{"text":"When I first moved to CLT, Cabo was one of my favorite spots. Since then, I've noticed a huge downturn in consistency and quality. The last two times I went, my food was cold and the dishes I normally order weren't consistent. With all of the new \"similar\" places opening up around CLT, there are several other better choices. Did someone say 'Sabor'?"}
{"text":"I'm from Southern Cal. Born and raised in East Los Lived in Sun Diego for 11 years. Cabo Fish Taco are authentic and AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my many favorite restaurants in Charlotte. You cant go wrong with any of their fish tacos. The fried shrimp taco is one of my favorites. The BBQ tuna taco is a fan favorite and is extremely flavorful if you looking for a twist on a fish taco.  I love most of theirs sides but am still disappointed that the jalapeno mashed potatoes are no longer on their menu.   The wait can be long but if you remember the days prior to their expansion, it's gotten a lot better. Parking in Noda is always difficult so be prepared to walk."}
{"text":"One of my favorites for a lunch on a Saturday with the family in Charlotte.  We had the pleasure of Jeremy yesterday as our waiter and he went above and beyond and made our visit even more enjoyable.  We always have a great meal and great time here and the food is always amazing so it's hard to get 'any better' but Jeremy is a first class act when it comes to customer service and left us talking about how soon we will be back!!!  Cant wait to get my next 'fix' of all that Cabo Fish Taco has to offer!!!! YUMMMMY!"}
{"text":"Ordered a few different dips and appetizers.  The crab dip with pita chips were AMAZING but the guacamole was less than impressive.  It tasted like processed guac...nothing fresh about it.  I've had the fish tacos with a fruity drink in the past and they were delicious.  Great atmosphere and food overall!"}
{"text":"This place is a must go to in Charlotte! We went on a friday around 12pm so the wait time wasn't too bad. I ordered tofu tacos was obsessed! These tacos were like something I've never had before! I added a little hot sauce to spice them up but other than that they were perfect. The restaurant and the waiters have a really chill, happy vibe making the experience even better!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat with friends. Great light meal where everything is just right."}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate with some friends on Friday night for my boyfriends birthday by taking him to his favorite restaurant, Cabo Fish Taco, in NoDa. The restaurant is so good that it's been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. We started out with the crab dip for an appetizer. The dip was so addicting and delicious. I love crab dishes that have more crab than cream cheese and this certainly did. The flavors that were added to the cream cheese made it even better. The pita chips it came with were fried and tasted like a funnel cake. My practice with moderation was definitely challenged. For my meal, I ordered the guacamole salmon salad with a vinaigrette dressing. The salmon was awesome, but I couldn't eat the lettuce because they poured cilantro all over the plate. I didn't know that it came with cilantro otherwise I would have had them take it off. The next time I went, I ordered it WITHOUT the cilantro and it was better:) The guacamole at this place is awesome!   We always have great service when we're at CFT. My brother, who is a fish taco king, said they had the best fish tacos HE HAS EVER EATEN. That was one hell of a compliment.   The restaurant is very hip and a great place to bring your friends or family who are visiting. It's definitely a touristy-y spot. After dinner, you can walk down the road for some drinks or coffee. Noda is a very hip neighborhood."}
{"text":"Tried Cabo for the first time a few years back, and wasn't very impressed. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was a Sunday, and it was slammed. Finally went back on a Tuesday night and the food was great, server was knowledgeable about the menu, and food was quick. Would make the 25 min drive again from huntersville to get the carne asada tacos."}
{"text":"This place has already earned the stars, it's been on TV too. Just another review from a food lover. The tacos here melt in your mouth, the sides options are different than usual. I am definitely going to eat here again the next time I'm in charlotte."}
{"text":"This place was easy to find but the parking is the worst in this area. I ended up parking along the street near the Y. I can just imagine how it would be on the weekend. We arrived for dinner about 7:30 and were promptly seated and offered water and chips. I ordered a margarita (I think) which was pretty tasty but the chips ... come on guys. I love chips and dip and the chips..... well tasted stale. I remember reading a review before I went and somebody else mentioned the chips not being so great. We actually asked the guy about them b/c we thought they were stale and he let us know that's how they are supposed to be.... they had made a fresh batch about 2 hours ago. I tried the lemon grilled shrimp tacos with rice and black beans. They were pretty tasty although the beans were a bit spicy. Overall a nice atmosphere and nice area just be warned that you have to probably park in a neighborhood. I will be back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"I have only been here once; however, my experience was great enough that I am already planning a trip back. I had the best chicken and shrimp burrito ever. The corn salsa is wonderful and our server was the sweetest. If you go on a weekend in the evenings be ready to wait awhile for a table but it is SO worth it."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about the restaurant at first because it was very laid back but I was open to trying to the food.  But from the moment the chips and dip were serviced I was mesmerized.  My group and I ordered crab dip with pita chips...... Aaaawwwww, they are to die for, I wanted to pack up that dish and take it home.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and advised us properly  based upon what we had a taste for.  This place wooed me, I will definitely return whenver I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love there appetizers the crab dip AWESOME!!! Been here twice salmon taco and bbq mahi is amazing..but the reason they received only three stars is the service slow and they continuously forgot to come by our table and there sides are not good at all..I think taco bells rice taste better and I haven't eaten there in over 5 years . But the main food is great and app. Try for yourself"}
{"text":"Overrated. I think the hype is bc they've been on TV. Foods otherwise is flavorless. Was trying to give them a chance to coming here a few times afterwards but Everytime I felt like I needed more salt or something in all the meals. Their fish tacos (which is what they're famous for) in my POV weren't up to all the hype.  Pretty much something you can get at another restaurant."}
{"text":"I would recommend hitting this place early it can get pretty crowded at night but you can usually find a spot at the bar if you just want to grab some grub and a few pops.  The staff is helpful and they will make any dish to your preference: allergic to dairy, no problems; don't like tomatoes, done.  The name gives it away, the fish taco's are pretty darn delicious.  The portion sizes are large and reasonably priced and with $2 longboards & tecates to wash it down, that's a pretty sweet deal."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to take a detour through Charlotte on our way home to Augusta from Wilson, NC. We wanted to eat somewhere in Charlotte and decided to pick Cabo Fish Taco because they were featured on Diners, Driveins, and dives. Overall the atmosphere was nice and friendly. For some reason the same dumb song played multiple times during our time there. Not sure what that was about. We were seated in a section that looks like they might open it up to the outside in warmer months. Someone was smoking just on the other side and it was coming in the restaurant.   We ordered cabo rolls and tuna tacos. The tacos and avocado pasta were amazing but the cabo rolls were too salty to eat. When we let our server know she immediately got us a menu to order something in place of the cabo rolls. We ordered the carne asada tacos and they were delicious! The chips weren't warm. I've never been to a good Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve warm chips. They did tasted good and the salsa was yummy and we will definitely return if we ever get to Charlotte again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Cabo Fish Taco. I loved the food! I ordered the shrimp and chicken burrito which was good. (The rice in the burrito was too soft and became mushy.) This is a fun spot to eat and enjoy drinks. I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone looking for a peaceful, family style restaurant. It was very loud. I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Went to Cabo for the first time and really enjoyed it. As soon as we were seated we received a bowl of corn and tomato salsa with tortilla chips.  Next we ordered a side of queso, which was delicious.  More flavor than your typical white queso, very good, especially when we mixed a bit of the corn salsa with it.  Next was the task of figuring out what to order for dinner and because it was our first time we didn't know quite what to order.  Tacos and quesadillas are cool, but we came here to try something new.  So we relied on a recommendation from the waiter.. the Baja Bowl with soy glazed salmon and honey wasabi sauce on the side... YUM!! That was a great choice.  The manager was really cool, she came and checked on us twice just to make sure we were enjoying everything, and we did!  Next time i'll have to try the Rasta Pasta."}
{"text":"Dropped in around 8pm on a Thursday because my friend hadn't eaten here yet. We had to wait 20-30 minutes. The hostess was a pinch rude when I asked where to stand while we waited (everywhere you stand in that place you're in the way!). I got an a la carte veggie taco which was decent, just oily (enough to make me sick).  I think I'm throwing the towel in on you, Cabo. I'll take the 3 miles drive to Plaza to go somewhere worth my money."}
{"text":"This place is way over rated for the price, there's always a wait. I can't understand why because the food isn't great and the service is subpar."}
{"text":"Awesome Food!  Awesome Service!  Great Atmosphere!  If you leave this place hungry, it's your own fault.  Try the fish and shrimp tacos...they're great!"}
{"text":"Though it's a little bit off the beaten path, this was one of the first restaurants I was taken to upon moving to Charlotte, which says a lot about it, I think. Smack dab in the middle of NoDa, CFT is worth checking out if only so that you have an excuse to check out the funky neighborhood its nestled in.   But the food and drink are worth it, too. As the name implies, try the fish tacos. My girlfriend's obsessed, and they're prepared the same way they are in Mexico--lightly battered, served with cilantro and all the fixins. Very fresh and very tasty, and not too expensive at all. The other food is standard mexican--nothing too transcendent, but it's all very good, too. I love the drinks here, and they sometimes have margarita specials which are worth checking out.   As for its environment, we love this place. It's small and intimate, so we love a date night here (clearly we're not alone). Definitely a good plan: go check out a gallery opening and eat here before or after. Or grab a romantic cocktail on your way home from some art-buying. Tres classy."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best place to eat in NoDa. I tried the beer battered shrimp, beer battered tofu, blackened mahi-mahi, and grilled serrano chicken. My favorite was the mahi mahi."}
{"text":"Had the blackened Mahi Mahi tacos - Yum!  Was nice to have a tasty option to fried fish tacos.  Will def be coming back :)"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Charlotte.  The taco shells are just special.  I tend to go with the shrimp tacos and whatever the seasonal side is (jalapeño mashed potatoes are awesome).  The taco salads are huge and the pasta dishes are also really delicious.  But really, get a taco...  The atmosphere is great too.  It's always packed but I never feel like I wait more than ten minutes (even if they say longer).    My only gripe at all about this place is that the chips always taste stale.  I love the salsa though."}
{"text":"TACO TACO! Who doesn't love tacos? I've been to this restaurant a few times. Fun fact Cabo Fish Taco, they were featured on DDD.   Personally, I love the Beer Battered Shrimp Tacos. Comes with two flour tortillas stuffed with cabbage, tomato, avocado, cheese, & finished with our white cilantro sauce.   I have never had a bad experience at Cabo. It has a really good ambiance with an interesting layout you would never find at a chain restaurant. Weekends get a little busy so come early."}
{"text":"Cabo was on point! It was so tasty and well worth the wait. So fair warning, there probably will be a wait, especially on the weekends. But like I said, worth it!   The atmosphere is a lot of fun, very high energy and loud but not too loud where you can't hear yourself or others talk. The food was really good as well. Wei t the crab dip as an appetizer...omg I could eat this everyday all day! The chips, the dip, everything about this was on point. Then we split the shrimp tacos with avacado pasta salad..FYI if you can't handle spice like me, they can take the spice out of the pasta salad. Pasta salad was great and the tacos were even better. Soooo much taste in one taco! I can't wait to return to try some more of the items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Overall AMAZING! Ask to sit in Marissa's section. All of her recommendations were super tasty! My sister ordered the Rasta pasta, which is chicken and shrimp pasta with a pineapple cream sauce! It was different yet good because the pineapple isn't too over powering and it's something different to try. I definitely recommend the salmon taco! It was sooo good. As an appetizer we got the shrimp and crab dip. It came with pita triangles that were soft and seasoned to perfection. The food alone is a reason to go and the service matched. Marissa was super sweet and was very attentive."}
{"text":"Had a lunch date at cabo fish and enjoyed out good I been here back to back in the last two week. Waiters are always super nice and hippy which I love. The cranes asada taco were great meat was a little tough but still well flavored, this place is awesome in the summer when the nods area have live bands ..."}
{"text":"I really hate to be a debbie downer, I know A LOT of people love this place....but I have a standard, if i can make it at home just as good or better, then it's not worth eating there.  And I would have to say, this is one of those places where I can make it just as good, and probably better at home, and i have had far superior tacos other places that i would go back and pay for.  We got the beer battered shrimp tacos with Nopalito Salad.. The shrimp weren't bad, but not the best i've ever had.  The taste was acceptable, but, as my dad would say, \"it's nothin' to write home to mom about.\"  and the Nopalito salad....ew.  My boyfriend had it there once before and said it was good, but this night he had to give it two thumbs down.  We also ordered BBQ MAHI TACOS, which based on the menu description, sounded like it would be really good!  ( Grilled mango BBQ Mahi-Mahi tacos stuffed with Cabo slaw, tomato, avocado, mixed cheeses & finished with our cilantro white sauce)  Yet when it got to the table, again the flavor was acceptable, but very mediocre.  I got it with the jalapeno mashers, which was apparently mashed potatoes with diced jar jalapenos and shredded cheese on top....and to be honest, i did not like the flavor of the mashed potatoes...there is a spice they put in it that just did not mix well with the flavor of potatoes....maybe cummin? or something like that...not sure, as i haven't really learned to tell completely the flavor of a spices.  But I really couldn't eat more than 2 bites and then thought to myself, its not worth wasting calories on something that doesn't taste good!  lol  The food was also room temperature, I would have expected it to be warmer when it got to the table.    for the money, I would say this place is not worth going back to.  If we would have paid $5  a plate, I wouldn't complain, but it was no were near worth about $10 a person for the quality of food we received.  If you're looking for good tacos, i'd say keep moving....in fact Taco Bell just may be more satisfying, cheaper, and give you hot food.  :)"}
{"text":"Visited Charlotte for a weekend and was recommended to this place a couple different times. Amidst a really fun and hip neighborhood is this towering cantina. It's like a portal to a seafood shack somewhere in a beach town.   Once seated, you are greeted with chips and what I think is homemade salsa. It was great! Definitely a different take from your typical restaurant salsa that is runny.   But, I didn't come here for salsa. I came for the fish tacos - they did not disappoint. I had both the battered shrimp and fish, both were so delicious. I ended up asking for lime to complement the tacos, which was definitely the right decision.  I would definitely visit this joint again, it was a great spot in a really fun neighborhood."}
{"text":"I hate to do this, but I can honestly say I'll never go back. I've had a lot of fish tacos in my time, and they've run the gamut, from stellar to absolutely forgettable. And even the forgettable ones are okay as repeats if I'm really in the mood for fish tacos. But the Cabo tacos are just in a whole nother level of bad. The mahi mahi was so overcooked and dried out I could barely press my fork though it. Eating it felt like chewing through paper. The coleslaw was totally boring. And the cilantro cream was \"meh.\"   I also ordered the nopalito salad which was unexceptional (more like a chickpea salad). The chips were stale. The salsa was extremely bland.   Yes, I'm from California where you can find the absolute best tacos, so I have to admit that small bias. HOWEVER the carelessness and uninventiveness with which Cabo is approaching their staple meal is unacceptable.  I just read in another review that the Food Network came here. What?!"}
{"text":"Sadly, we had a really bad experience. Our guacamole had a really strange texture and unpleasant taste and the tacos were hardly even mediocre. The fish tacos had no cabbage, cilantro, or lime, they were pretty lacking in general and were served with wilted green leaf lettuce. The black beans and rice had no flavor. The party at the table next to us had to send their meal back for being uncooked. It was just not a meal I would ever come back for."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very friendly staff! Was not impressed with the chips (tasted stale), salsa and guacamole....this is a must at a Mexican restaurant. However, the burrito and tacos were very delicious!!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back for the tacos. I'm sure they are all amazing. The only ones I tried were the bbq mahi and the grilled lemon chicken and shrimp tacos. Amazing. Just amazing. I will try more when i go back. The drinks were not consistent.  I had an amazing margarita (the original) and then my 2nd was bad, sent it back, returned less than great. Nothing like the first one that was made. And this was the same bartender. Oh well. Next time I'll get beer, that's always reliable. The guac was good but a little salty. The corn salsa that's on the table was hands down the best!!! I filled up mostly on that. So yummy. Prices overall were not bad so I will go back for the tacos. The rating is 100% on the tacos. Without the tacos and corn salsa, this place would get 2 stars...that's how good those 2 items are."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The tuna tacos were fantastic and the chips and salsa were some of the best I've ever had. Had the cabo toll appetizer and it was good but honestly not needed with the free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"First time I came here was for lunch and it was pretty empty. I didn't know what to expect. But what I did know was that the corn salsa was the bomb. The mahi mahi and carne asada tacos were pretty good too. But this last time I went to Cabo Fish Taco will probably be my last unless I'm dragged along with a group of people. It was a really busy weeknight because it was the first time the weather was nice after winter. We put our name and number down and told it would be a 20 minute wait. After about 45 minutes and seeing people get seated before us that arrived after us, we asked the hostess how much longer our wait would be. She immediately sat us down, realizing that we were still there. I had the Honey Wasabi Tuna burrito and it was okay. The thing that made me not want to come back was eating my leftovers the next day. My lips tingled and felt like they were swollen every time I took a bite. I eat raw tuna all of the time. Not sure if this was bad fish or what, but it makes me hesitant to come back."}
{"text":"Finally made it and have to say I wasn't truly impressed.  I got one of the tuna tacos with refried beans.  The beans were lukewarm.  Took awhile to get our drinks.  I wasn't impressed with their chips either, needed some salt and some seemed stale. The music was alittle too loud as to where we couldn't hear the waitress and she couldn't hear us.  Dont get me wrong, I\"d give it another try but only if I'm in the area, I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"First time coming. Had the honey soy glazed salmon and lemon grilled shrimp taco with mashed potatoes. Also had queso dip. Everything was amazing but honey soy glazed salmon was the MVP which was suggested by my waiter. Great customer service and decor. Affordable pricing also. I will for sure comeback."}
{"text":"Do you like bob Marley ? Fried food and cod in particular ? Then this place will not disappoint. This place really does not make you feel bad about those calories."}
{"text":"I know cabin has been getting mixed reviews lately... but I'm still a fan! I've been going for a couple years. It used to be so popular that the wait was ridiculous. Glad they expanded and have more seating now.  Everything I've had here has been great! Just thinking about the fish tacos while writing this review make me want to go eat."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The tacos are great and the sides can sometimes even be better! That avocado pasta salad!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since my last visit here...so long that it was probably before my Yelp days so needless to say this is my first review of the place.  I remember it being so much better than my recent visit.  This visit was a disappointment. The best thing about the visit was the jalapeno margarita but I think you can find better ones of those elsewhere in Charlotte.  Like most mexican or tex/mex places we were given the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were stale so I wasn't really interested in dipping them in the corn salsa.  I ordered the Tavarua Tuna tacos with a side of their mashed potatoes mixed with jalapenos. The tuna and sauce were good. The rest of it was meh. The tortilla shell was rubbery. The mashed potatoes were only partially cooked and I've had better mashed potatoes at a 24 hour diner. My friend ordered the chicken quesadilla in which she offered me a taste and I thought it was quite bland.  I remember Cabo being so much better than this. I guess the appearance on Triple D went to their heads or something like that."}
{"text":"Wait, did I just step into a beach island club, or a restaurant in NoDa. I can't tell. There's some crazy loud music that's not *all* bad, and there's a nice breeze on the veranda, and food that resembles baja mexican, but, ehhh not quite. So, I don't know, I'm confused. I want to like it, it's so close.   Atmosphere:  This is the only real reason to come here. As far as places go in NoDa, it's got some sense of style and some decent music that jams out onto the patio. It's a noisy place, so if you're a big whiny-baby that can't take some loud conversations over top of some fairly loud music, perhaps you'll be better off somewhere else, because the food won't make it worth it for you.   Food Leaves a lot to be desired. The teriaki sauce dishes are pretty terrible. I keep forgetting that and ordering them, then throw a little fit inside myself for not remembering. The salsa they bring out at the beginning is fresh corn salsa that is ok, but they give you a heap of it on a tiny tiny children's toy of a plate, so you focus like Frodo trying not to dump it all over the table each scoop.   Service:  Nothing special. Some nice folks here, they do their job and nothing more.   Celebrity most likely to enjoy eating here:  Perhaps someone from the Jersey shore. They seem to like noisy clubs and their spray tan makes me think they are mexican.   Half hour to live and I have to get my last meal here:  I'd just eat the free salsa and get drunk on some mojitos."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I always order the mahi mahi tacos. The queso is awesome too.  I think the last time I went there was a shrimp taco with thai chili sauce but I substituted for mahi and it was no big deal.  Tequila shots are a must here. Great atmosphere.  On busy nights there is always a wait but try and get the patio of it's nice out."}
{"text":"We grabbed dinner here with little time to spare before heading for a show at Ovens Auditorium.  We've been wanting to try it for a while and they didn't disappoint.  We were greeted by a couple friendly faces at the door and seated in the seasonally enclosed patio area on a cold winter day.  It was toasty in there so no problems there.  We informed our server we were in a bit of a rush and he was super helpful and took our drink and food order right away.  Before we knew it we had our delicious tacos in front of us.  We each got one of the traditional fish tacos they are known for and then got another variety to try.  I had one that had a jalapeño Creme sauce.  It was really delicious but still didn't top the original fish tacos.  I also had the avocado pasta salad as a side.  Yummy but I left about half of it because the tacos were so filling I couldn't eat any more.  I love the atmosphere here and it seems like a great spot for hanging out at the bar and eating some tasty food!"}
{"text":"I have to give Cabo 4 stars because of my husband. He doesn't yelp, but this is hands down his favorite place. If I'm out of town- he will go here repeatedly. I'm not as impressed.  Cabo started in Blacksburg. Anyone else notice the high number of Hokies that live in the Charlotte area?   The inside is really nice. I like the décor. They renovated the building and did a great job. There is a little patio.   I usually get the Lemon Grass Shrimp tacos. I like the mexi-slaw as the side. They have an INCREDIBLE corn chowder- but it isn't always on the menu. Order it if you see it.  My husband loves almost everything on the menu and always raves about it. BTW- this place can get PACKED. This is NOT a smart place to go to with a big group."}
{"text":"Every time I travel to Charlotte, I make it a point to eat at Cabo Fish Taco. It is my favorite place to eat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ya know, the first time I came here a few summers ago, it was great. BUT, the last time I ate here it wasn't that great. Maybe it was the time of day, or the month, but my chips were stale and the waiter was a smart ass. Going back to both experiences, my tacos were always great! I've tried just about all of the tacos and I love the queso. Try to go when there is a crowd...the food is better and guaranteed fresh. I'm guessing the cooks get a lil lazy when there isn't a crowd...hence the stale chips. haha."}
{"text":"I had a great time here for lunch ... my waiter was very friendly and the food was delicious!  I really enjoyed the corn salsa and chips that came as soon as we sat down - it was a nice change from the standard tomato salsa.  I went created a taco lunch of two different specialty tacos. I had the lemon grilled shrimp taco which had a nice light flavor while the tuna with the honey wasabi dressing was awesome! The tacos had generous portions of shrimp and tuna respectively. You can choose your side and I went with the refried beans - it was a lot spicier than I was anticipating, but it was a pleasant surprise. The only thing about the beans that I didn't like was that it was served a bit cold. Other than that I really enjoyed this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"It's great, but remember I have everyone in the group there when you show up!  If not it's off to the bar... Or patio waiting area if that's your poison!"}
{"text":"Divey. (not in a great way)  Murals are odd-looking.  Taco's were burnt - but that's the way they do it.  Service - discombobulated.  Not just the new people.  More women than men after work.  LOUD!"}
{"text":"Cabo is AWESOME!!! What is there not to love, on their menu??? My favorite appetizer, hands down, is their Baja Shrimp & Crab dip with those warm, crisp Pita chips! Mmmmm..... *mouth watering* Their Cabo Roll is good too, and that's just the appetizers! Nice, strong drinks and the tacos have great creativity behind them, with good flavor. Im not crazy about the idea of eating Mahi Mahi. But, if I'd eat it anywhere? It'd be Cabos! I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Had higher expectation for this restaurant.  It was so loud, that it was hard to carry on a conversation.  Guacamole was very delicious, but the chips were stale.  When we asked for fresher chips, the waitress said, \"there all like that.\"  Burrito was good, but not great.  I'd try it again.  Maybe they were having an off day."}
{"text":"Decided to go out to this place haven't been since I finished college in 2014 and the food is still amazing. Just wish the wait was not over a hour long . Enjoy my tocos and drinks"}
{"text":"Food was good as usual but the wait for our food was exceptionally long. We will be back the next time we come through Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love Cabo Fish Taco! It is one of the most popular places to eat in Charlotte and rightly so. Their mahi-mahi tacos are delicious, and their guacamole is incredibly fresh. The atmosphere is great too, it's right in the heart of NoDa near other amazing places to go around too."}
{"text":"We tried Cabo for lunch on a busy Saturday, and it was awesome. I've heard many great things about Cabo, and the food and service exceeded my expectations. First off, the complimentary chips and salsa were very good. The chips were fresh and seasoned well. The fresh corn salsa/pico had a lot of corn and had a nice crunch to it; it's different from your typical tomato based salsa.   For my entree, I ordered the speciality ahi tuna and teriyaki salmon tacos with Mexican cole slaw. Both tacos were fantastic. The tortilla was lightly fried and was a little bit greasy, but hot and had a slight crunch. There was a very generous amount of fish chunks, and they tasted really fresh. The ahi tuna had a nice sear and was rare on the inside, which is a must. The light sauce and wasabi complimented the tuba very well and made it a great taco to eat. The teriyaki salmon was also super flavorful and a great Japanese taste to it. The tacos with the slaw and chips were filling and great to eat.   Overall, I would highly recommend Cabo as a great lunch spot because it's not as busy as dinner. The fish tacos were excellent and a must try. The fish tasted fresh and were served in huge chunks. I would definitely come back next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place has good service and have came here over the years . Came here today for my 30th. NOT THE SAME PLACE !! The food just wasn't good . All tacos my husband and I got were cold, very cold and the chips were stale. Get it together Cabo... word is starting to get out !!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants! We love the beer battered fish tacos, but we usually try something off their seasonal/ rotating menu. The flavors are so fresh and unique, definitely worth the try. Hands down, best queso I've ever had. You will gain a lot of weight your first time here because you'll want to drink that deviously delicious white cream sauce. I mean, this review should just say: Queso. Honestly the whole menu is amazing and fun to go to with a group so you can try a bit of everything. The free salsa they give you is unique and sweet!! The interior is unique and the service is usually very good. 5/5 on all areas!"}
{"text":"Most creative taco place! The first time I went I ordered the BBQ mahi tacos and they were AMAZING! Super flavorful, fresh tortilla was perfectly crispy and they had a good texture from the slaw. Definitely a hipster vibe/setting, portion size was good for the price. I've been back a few times since and I've tried the tempura salmon tacos (daily special) and the crab dip. The crab dip is probably the best thing on the menu, next time I might order that as my meal! Only downside...I wish the chips were a little hotter and I wasn't a huge fan of their corn salsa it was more of a pico but overall great place!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite date spot. We are here at least once every other week, and Cabo never disappoints!! Located in the cute NoDa district of Charlotte, Cabo Fish Taco has a laid-back, southern Cali vibe with 2 bars tucked inside and outdoor patio seating. There isn't a bad spot in the house. The patio is heated for colder weather.   The food is unreal. When you are seated your server will bring you their house-made salsa and chips. It is so fresh and tasty. I love to try their weekly specials, one of my all-time favorites being the Wahoo taco. Their season jalapeño mashed potatoes are so delicious! This is available in the colder months. We always start with the crab dip appetizer, no one can beat their crab dip.  Staff is friendly, and service is on point. They also have a great drink selection, and a great margarita menu. My favorite being the Azul margarita!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to restaurants in charlotte. When people come into town to visit this is usually one of the first places I recommend due to its uniqueness and killer food. This is far from a chain which is exactly what I look for in a restaurant.   As you'd expect from the name, their fish tacos are nothing short of incredible. I've had nearly all of the tacos on the menu including many of their specials. My favorites continue to be the Tavaroo Wahoo and the lemon grilled shrimp. You really can't go wrong though.   A solid choice for anyone looking for something out if the ordinary."}
{"text":"The tacos here were VERY good! The food is fresh and has a very unique taste. I will definitely come again next time in Noda."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were mediocre and had BBQ sauce!? Most disappointing taco place I've ever been to, especially since everybody had nothing but wonderful things to say. I don't know what the reviews are like for Bakersfield but the tacos are 10x better, along with the atmosphere and crowd."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend the honey wasabi tuna steak burrito. I only was able to finish the whole thing, because it is all that I ate for the entire day; It's a hefty serving. My only little downer about the place was that staff did seem to be very short on enthusiasm."}
{"text":"Love this place! Get the lime shrimp tacos...amazing!! Don't forget a house margarita. Casual fun atmosphere, friendly staff and great food!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've had east of Southern California.  Tuna tacos were awesome, and loved the light, flaky tortillas used to make the tacos.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second try.. And now I can officially say that I do not like this place at all. You can get MUCH better food and service at an endless number of places in Charlotte. I spent $75 on the worst dinner ever, and am sad I can't get my money back for such a waste.   The waiter we had, Matt, was the absolute worst. I manage a restaurant, and I've been a server... He should not be serving.  And the most important part - my food was SO bland and weird - (carrots and zucchini and other veggies in a fried taco bowl?) so I said I didn't like the food, but that im willing to pay for it and just take it home, and that I can order something else.. Matt didn't apologize, or even care to ask how he can make it better. I ordered another meal, which was my third entree (including my boyfriends) and ended up paying the $75.   It was my boyfriends birthday... The only thing he enjoyed was the $2.75 buckshots.  All around - Horrible horrible horrible horrible, and even more horrible."}
{"text":"Cabo is a solid place for a meal or takeout. Good food, good vibe, good service, but beware - the tortilla chips are almost always stale. I have been there before and noticed servers scooping chips into baskets and letting them sit next to the bar to grab as needed. I understand the urge to save time while serving, but this guarantees that the chips will be stale when they reach the table. Also, because they're sitting out in the open, it increases the chance of contamination from all kinds of things...so no thanks. If you get stale chips - complain. It's the only way to make them change the way they do it. The avocado pasta salad and queso dip are not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today - great food and great service. I love fish tacos, and have had them from all over, these were very tasty. Loved the bbq and thoroughly enjoyed the black black bean and rice on the side to give my tacos more filling. I was surprised (pleasantly) how full of fish they actually were - which is another reason why this place gets a great review. I highly recommend trying this place if you enjoy fish or shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"Great food! One of my favorite places in charlotte. Price is acceptable. It's in the Hippie part of town, but it's a nice \"Friday after work chill spot\". Love it!"}
{"text":"This was my first stop on a whirlwind tour of the culinary scene of Charlotte while here on business. It was a suggestion of my hotel Bartender as a good place to get food in NODA, with other places nearby to explore. I sat at the bar and enjoyed a margarita from a very nice young lady whose name escapes me - it was a unique name - but thank you to her because her suggestions on where to go next (\"see Mike and Kelly @ Davidson Street Public House\") would kick off my tour of bars and restaurants. I got a burrito with seared ahi tuna, wasabi, and avocado maybe? I can't remember everything in it but t was amazing. The only drawback was that the bar and restaurant as a whole were sticky and messy. I usually hate this about a place but I did roll in within 30 minutes of closing and I could tell it had been a busy night so I give them a general pass on that aspect. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend Cabo Fish Taco to anyone. And I will be back! Maybe next time for happy hour ;)"}
{"text":"This is a great spot in the heart of NODA. The atmosphere is fun, friendly & super relaxed. Cannot say enough about the quality & taste of this food. We loved the corn salsa & chips to start. The corn salsa was sweet to start with a nice kick of heat at the end. We had the steak tacos, the lemon grilled shrimp tacos, the tavaroo tuna tacos, the carne asada & the honey salmon tacos. Everyone had a distinct flavor & were delicious. My favorite were the shrimp because I loved the pickled red onions that were on top. Their sides are great. Definitely recommend the mexi slaw & the napolito salad. My son had the churros with the chocolate dipping sauce, which were made to perfection. They were fried but not greasy.  If you go on a Friday or Saturday expect to wait but I can tell you it was worth it.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My fiance and I live in Florida, but she is a former Charlotte resident and this was one of the places she was most excited about taking me. It did not disappoint. Located in a cool part of NoDa, Cabo Fish Taco has good service, a good atmosphere, and most importantly, good food!  You get free chips and salsa prior to your meal. And they have a solid beer selection, including a good number or local craft brews. I ordered the tavarua (tuna) tacos and was pleased with that decision as the overall flavor of the tacos was great. If I'm ever in the Charlotte area again, this is definitely a place I'd go again."}
{"text":"Having for some reason been here twice now, I've come to the conclusion that Cabo makes it's fried seafood tacos well and everything else is decidedly meh. I've tried two of their specials, which though well seasoned, were just hopelessly overcooked.  Still my fried shrimp tacos were solid and the tecate tall boys are like 3 bucks so it's not too bad."}
{"text":"This is one of the most talked-about restaurants in Charlotte and it definitely lives up to the hype! Food is super fresh, service is great and it's a fun atmosphere. I had the shark taco (on special) and it was incredible. The server suggested other items when I put in my order, which I appreciated because it was BOMB!"}
{"text":"Generally I am a fan if I stick to what I know I like  The beer battered shrimp cabo-tacos. When I get this I am a happy camper...but I have tried other things that fall short.  Chips and corn salsa can go either way- sometimes they are fresh and delicious - sometimes they are stale and not so delicious.   I had the lemon tuna tacos yesterday and they were just-ok. I like my tuna on the rarer side so this didn't really do it for me. The cabo fish tacos are just ok in my opinion -although I am not a huge fried fish eater. I am not so into the steak tacos either.   The jalapeno mashers  are really tasty although they certainly are not the most health conscious choice   Margaritas are pretty standard here. I've had good luck in terms of service and the place itself is really cool.  Solid 3.5-4 ( 4 if I get my go-to meal)"}
{"text":"Everyone gives this place 5 stars but my experience wasn't that great. The only seating they had was at the bar and the chairs were pretty uncomfortable. They didn't have a blender so they only serve on the rocks margaritas. I'm a blended marg girl...disappointing to say the least. Also the tacos weren't that great. BUT I AM from Texas so I'm pretty picky when it comes to tacos... I will give this place another shot though."}
{"text":"I wish my home town of Columbia, SC had a fish taco place just like this, I love fish tacos. Cabo had a ton of energy when I went, the mood and the atmosphere was hip and quaint like the neighborhood it was nesseled in, on a small corner of Charlotte. The service was fast and friendly. Cabo puts a good foot forward with it's corn salsa and chips that come out before meal, I could have just ate this. When I received my beer battered fish taco my first thought was wow is that food or art. My second thought when I bit into it was grease is the word is the word, can I get a towel over here. Over all Cabo was good I might come back sometime, but I think I'll ask them to towel off my taco next time."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I first heard about this place from a friend of mine and decided to check it out. So I went there with another friend, but when we arrived it was a 15 minute wait. I didn't have a problem waiting, but the hostess suggested that we wait at the bar and she will come get us when our table is ready. So my friend and I went up to the bar and was greeted by a rude bartender. My friend and I didn't want to drink, so when we were asked what we wanted, we just said water. The bartender was upset and told us that we would have to order a drink in order to stay at the bar, because \"drinks make me money. that's why I'm here.\" It was at that point that I started to feel unwelcomed, so I felt compelled to order a drink. So once our table was ready and we were seated, yet again we were greeted by a rude waitress. This was our first time there and we were stuck on what to order because the prices were a little too much for ordinary platters. Apparently we took too long to decide what we want because the waitress asked if we could decide what we wanted at the bar so that other people can have the table. I was completely appalled and disgusted. I didn't even get a chance to eat the food because the poor customer service ruined my appetite."}
{"text":"Good spot for a good cheap dinner. Although typically there's a long wait and it can be tough to have a conversation in there due to the loud noise, it's a good spot for dinner and drinks with friends. There are lots of combinations and choices of tacos, including very good fish tacos."}
{"text":"I don't love the corn salsa, but one can get past that with a little guacamole to accompany the thick, yummy tortilla chips. Get the classic Mahi Mahi tacos or the BBQ Mahi Mahi and you'll be in fish taco heaven."}
{"text":"I hear hoots and hollers about this staple of the NoDa district but I was honestly not too impressed. I went in with two other friends. The hostess was polite and friendly and entertained me with a chat while I waited for my friends to show. But this was more of an obligation as Cabo is one of those places where they will not seat you if your whole party is not there. Even on a Tuesday night when half the restaurant is empty. So don't even ask.  When they showed up and we got our table we each ordered something a little different. I split my taco choice getting one with fried shrimp and the other with fried fish - it was a fried food kind of night for me. My friends got salmon tacos straight-up and the salmon salad. For starters the salad and the salmon in it were pretty tasty. I can't remember if it was guacamole or sliced avocados in it but either way it was a delicious addition. Apparently that salad is one of the hottest things on the menu here.  But my other friend and I figured on the namesake of the place and went with the tacos. The plates came out with that delicious smell of fried and grilled fish and we dove in. But the fried fish was tasteless and 3/4 fried batter crust which just blanketed the general flavor. The fried shrimp was okay but in general the tacos were lacking in additional spices. If you want better seafood or other types of tacos I would suggest Krazy Fish first and foremost. Most likely I will be back to Cabo for some function or other gathering but I won't likely bank on the tacos again. That salad will be what I go for next."}
{"text":"I went to Cabo in 2010 with my wife and it was just a bad night.  Neither of us liked it and we didn't return for two years.  That being said, I've missed out on two years where we could have enjoyed Cabo Fish Taco!  I went twice last week and both times it was fantastic!  Cheese dip was average, Guac was wonderful, BBQ Mahi and the Tavaroo tacos were phenomenal!  I'm excited to try some more new things soon!  *quick edit update:  they are using wahoo right now in replacement of the tuna due to oil apparently.   Had the Tavaroo tacos again and it is still wonderful.  Wahoo is a white fish and it was very fresh.  Still a safe order!  :)"}
{"text":"The food was very good. They have a great selection when it comes to interesting types of tacos. I enjoyed both the mahi-mahi & carne asada tacos I ordered. The Churros are awesome too! The spicy avocado pasta salad was def worth a try."}
{"text":"I can never really decide if I like Guy Fieri.  On the one hand, he seems like a bit of a douche, with the sunglasses on the back of his head and the sweatbands all over the place.  On the other hand, anyone has to be better than Melissa d'Arabian, right?  So one of the places that Guy has visited on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\" is Cabo Fish Taco, a funky little place in NoDa, famous for - what else - fish tacos.  The big problem with fish tacos in NoDa should be obvious to just about anyone: Charlotte is nowhere near the ocean.  Any ocean.  Now if they are pulling fish fresh from a nearby lake, cooking it up and plopping it on a taco, then maybe.  Just maybe.  But somehow I do not think that is what we have here.  Instead, it is a generally average joint nestled amongst the buildings in NoDa, and it has a reasonable reputation, surely bolstered by their appearance on Triple D.  The service is not bad, but the food?  Really middle-of-the-road.  As has been mentioned, they start you off with this funky corn salsa that is different than what you usually get in this sort of place, but really is not that great.  If the chips are stale, it is worse.  Then you pick some tacos.  Most of them are decent, but just not that memorable.  None seem to be outstanding.  When you factor in the need to wait for a table and be jostled about with a crowd, it just may not be worth all the hassle, you know?"}
{"text":"I heard this place was \"all hyped\" but honestly I really enjoyed my visit. Tacos were great and the service was efficient. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Thought I should update my review since it's been over a year. Came here with a party of 6 and was told it was gonna be an hour and a half. To our surprise we only waited about 45 mins! I was excited! We sat in the covered patio area. It was warm but very loud.   Our server was super sweet and attentive. Everyone got tacos and they were all satisfied with it. I got the grilled salmon taco and carne asada taco. Both delicious and fresh!! Filled with toppings!! I got the avocado spicy pasta salad which I highly recommend. Bursting with flavor and just perfect. I could of honestly just eaten that and be happy.   We didn't have any issues with parking. The only thing I don't like about this place is that there is two bathrooms total for men and women to share. I had to wait in line with 4 people in front of me."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place! But I was a little underwhelmed. The wait was longer than we were quoted so that wasn't a great start. Our waitress was nice and pretty attentive. Unfortunately the chips were rather stale but the salsa was tasty. The food came out quickly but wasn't very warm which was a big bummer. In general the side dishes all needed salt except for the avocado pasta salad which was good. Overall it just didn't live up to the expectations I had been given."}
{"text":"I'm in foodie heaven here! Perfect fish tacos, and that shrimp dip - to die for! Atmosphere is great, service is friendly and excellent. Do try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Enjoying myself with friends who are like family. The shrimp and crab chip is THE BEST."}
{"text":"So I saw this place on DDD so of course I had to check it out it was pretty good the tacos were very filling and you could taste the fresh ingredients the jalapeño mash potatoes left something to be desired but the tacos more than make up for it ...the atmosphere is Latin Kitch and it's in the art district so there are a lot of cool shops in the area if your up for it ..the best part about this place is the cilantro sauce That goes in the tacos I recommend this place simple fresh clean food !"}
{"text":"What has happened to you Cabo Fish Taco?  I came in a few months ago and was very impressed.  Today I had out of town guests in town and ordered fish tacos to go.  I had raved about your food.  They had the lemon shrimp and the beer battered Fish tacos.  It was all horrible.  Just awful.  There was no Fish just soggy batter.  Shrimp tasted frozen Sysco style.  It was embarrassing to me to have raved about you and then get that food.  Not happy and won't go back.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see this many reviews. Cabo is ok at best. I had 2 tacos for lunch which were good but nothing to rave about. The steak and shrimp were my choices. Neither were overlooked or chewy, like I said decent. The corn salsa is not a can't miss. Overall, I won't be back and I can't see anytng special about this place. $12 for two tacos, no drink."}
{"text":"Delicious fish tacos!!! I had the bbq mahi and wahoo tacos. Very tasty corn salsa and spicy avacado pasta salad too!"}
{"text":"Every time I pass by this place, there was always a long line and people would rave about it from co workers to management staff at my apt building to uber drivers!   But I have mixed reviews about this place after I tried their fish tacos and BBQ mahi. Really overpriced for the lack of quality. The tacos were mediocre- fish tacos tasted bland and the batter overpowered the fish inside. The BBQ sauce on the Mahi tasted like it came from a bottle that you can buy from the store and fish was overcooked.  Will prob go back here again only because our server was so pleasant and accommodating. She noticed I didn't like the beer she suggested so she offered me what i originally wanted on the house. They clean the tables right away and try to seat ppl as fast as they can."}
{"text":"I love this place. The vibe is super chill and the food is always amazing. Sometimes there is a wait but that's  only because everyone knows it's  worth it!"}
{"text":"Right off the bat the corn salsa they give you is incredible and could be eaten as a side dish on its own. Food came out a little slow on a busy Friday night, but that just gave us more time to enjoy the salsa-our waitress was kind enough to bring another after we quickly demolished the first one. The fish tacos were excellent and the blackened shrimp and chicken burrito my girlfriend ordered was outstanding. I would highly recommend-my only caveat is that the environment inside is very loud."}
{"text":"Get it together cabo. No one should have to wait for their whole party to arrive to be sat. You're lazy. Take a reservation like a normal restaurant. Tacky."}
{"text":"Great hang out place. There's a reason this place is always packed to the gills during mealtimes and weekends. Their food is good, their service is excellent, and it's just got an overall great vibe.  I recommend the queso dip if you want your willpower tested. I'm not usually a fan of queso dips (*gluuurg* calories), but there was something about this one that just.... crack, it had to have been crack. It was crack queso dip.  Cabo Fish Taco serves various forms of crack, skillfully folded into their food. My dining companion was quite taken with the honey wasabi sauce. It went into the Mahi Mahi fish taco she thoroughly enjoyed, and it went into the side of rice. She considered briefly drizzling it into her margarita before she finally resigned to just putting a small lid on the container (thoughtfully provided by our excellent server) and slipping it into her purse.   I had the lemon-grilled shrimp on a corn tortilla (because flour is the devil, or at least my devil), and some sort of chickpea, tomato, and black bean concoction on the side. While the shrimp was tasty and the overall taco was a good blend, he white cilantro sauce (sour cream, yogurt, and cilantro) could *really* have used more, you know, cilantro.. or crack. I'd take crack. I could be biased because I'm a cilantro fiend. Hey, they're good for your kidneys. The salad-ish thing on the side could  have used a lot of something, anything. It was really tasteless. I really like all three of those ingredients normally, but put them together with nothing delicious (or crack-like) to, you know, rule them, find them, and in the darkness bind them... er what? It was just lackluster.   Have I mentioned service was excellent? We came in on New Year's Day and was there ever a day where water was more needed? My glass was always refilled promptly, even as I was sucking down glass #3 or 5 or something.  Definitely worth your while. I'll be back some day, Fish Taco."}
{"text":"Relaxed unpretentious place. Nice energy as usual in noda We went because of the DDD tv visit and the good Yelp reviews.   Not too long of a wait and I like that they just text you instead of one of those vibrating things. The chips and salsa were good and free is always nice. You can get fresh guacamole too if you want. Started with the crab dip. We loved cheesy with warm pita.a winner for sure I had the tuna tacos and it was perfectly med rare withe spicy wasabi sauce. Big chunks . I ordered two but could only eat one.  My friend got the lemon shrimp tacos and she said the shrimp were sweet , tender and not over cooked. Again a winner The avocado pasta salad make you think your in a modern era and not in granny's kitchen. The parking can be tough because it's on the street but we figured we just had to walk off all that food This is a good place to bring out of town guests and or big groups."}
{"text":"Great venue with a good vibe and music to match. Burritos on point, tacos on point, mashed potatoes amazing, beef and veggie soup fucking awesome. And their can of Tecate was immaculate. Their chips were stale, but I didn't come for chips."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after reading all the reviews. Unfortunately I left with more to be desired. The shrimp tacos I had looked good. I mean the presentation was on point! However it really lacked flavor. My wife's shrimp Baja bowl was sodium crazy! I guess the lid came off when they were putting the salt in. The salsa they give you is not the best and the chips were stale. Also maybe our server was having a bad day but we literally only saw her twice, once when we first sat down to after our food was brought out. If you're visiting Charlotte and trying to find a place to eat skip Cabo Taco you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Most def the best tasting food I've had in Charlotte so far. The rasta pasta off the hook!!"}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco 3201 N Davidson St Charlotte, NC 28205 Saturday June 24, 2017 9:30pm  Let's just say some people love it and some people hate it and I'm right there in the middle. I'm not really sure what the hype is about this place. I think it might just be the hipster place to eat in NoDa.   This not being my first time here but not coming in a long time (5 plus years since my last visit) these are the reasons I like Cabo Fish Taco: 1 - Consistently good food and drinks. These are the reasons I DON'T like Cabo Fish Taco: 1- Consistently a 30 minute wait 2- it's soooo loud.   On this visit I ordered the shrimp and chicken burrito and the spicy avocado pasta salad. I really enjoyed both items and thought they were worth the price. I also had the Azulita Rita with sugar rim and thought it was a great drink choice. Since I'm not a fan of fish  and think that tacos are overpriced unless they are a $1 special I quickly overlooked the taco options. However the only reason I was here this visit was because an out of town friend is in love with the BBQ Mahi taco. I tasted the fish and it was good but not anything to write home about.   I probably won't be back unless someone else just has to go. And if I want the meal I had again I will probably just order togo!"}
{"text":"You MUST order the Tavarua tacos! They were seriously the best tacos I've ever had. We tried a few others there that were still good, but NOTHING beats the Tavarua!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks.  Tacos are always fresh and the ingredients are awesome.  I enjoy coming here.  Atmosphere is on the louder side but it's nothing annoying.  I love the drinks here, strong!  Brooke (AKA Cobra) is an amazing bartender.  She can make anything for you.  Overall, one of the best spot in NoDa."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go in CLT. Always fresh and tasty. Epic tuna burrito is my pick."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Cabo Fish Taco, from friends in Charlotte and from Food Network.  I decided it was time I found out what all the fuss is over.  I'm now left wondering just what, exactly, all the fuss IS over.  Cabo has generated a lot of hype, but does not have the substance to back it up.  Given that it was a Saturday night, I assumed there would be a bit of a wait.  We were told we'd have a table in 10 minutes, and the hostess was pretty accurate.  After initially getting our names on the wait list, though, she could have done without immediately telling us we were in her way (in those words, exactly).  We made it to our table, and the waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink orders.  We inquired about the specials on the chalk board, only to find out those were from yesterday and no one got around to updating the sign.  We placed our orders from the regular menu.  And waited.   And waited. And watched other tables, who were seated AFTER us, receive their orders BEFORE us.  Mind you, half the restaurant is still empty.  After 45 minutes of waiting and inattentive service from our waitress, she explained there was a mix up in the kitchen.  She was unable (unwilling?) to compensate us in any way for such poor service.  The food finally arrived and I was unimpressed.  It tasted good, but not Food Network, everyone's-talking-about-it good.  The tacos were more lettuce than fish and the slaw was rather bland.  When you add it all up, and factor in the fact that the place is so loud it's impossible to do more than look at the other people at your table, I felt like I had wasted my money and the better part of my evening on a miserable experience.  Needless to say, I won't be giving Cabo a second chance."}
{"text":"Really great! Casual atmosphere. Had the BBQ mahi tacos and honey wasabi mahi burrito. Excellent."}
{"text":"Our only mistake was going on a Saturday night. They told us some outrageous wait time like 2+ hours. The boyfriend was ready to go back to the hotel but I insisted on trying to grab a seat at the bar. I'm so glad that we did! We stood at the bar area for less than 5 minutes and was able to grab 2 seats, together!!! The crab dip was AMAZING and the drinks were pretty good too. Another plus was that we didn't wait too long for the food, despite it being sooooo crowded. Nice blended crowd and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cabo fish taco is an excellent place to eat. Service is great. Beer selection decent. And food on point. Get the pasta salad."}
{"text":"Found this place in NoDa on a first time trip to Charlotte - the spicy avocado pasta salad and blackened mahi mahi fish tacos were beyond delicious! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cabo has lots of great reviews, but let me add mine to the fold. This place has become a staple for me after Carolina Panthers football games in the fall. I am from Greensboro, so traveling north on I-85 right after games is a nightmare. Instead, I opt to pass some time and have a good meal at this establishment in NoDa.  They have an interesting and wide variety of tacos here. Obviously a lot of fish offerings from Mahi Mahi to Tuna and even Swordfish. But beyond that, the carne asada is some of the best you'll eat, and they have an incredible pasta salad that is made with avocado. Be sure not to pass up the queso dip, which is infused with chipotle pepper, and thicker than your average mexican queso dip."}
{"text":"When you're deciding on what to order at Cabo, stick with what they do best - fish tacos.  I've had fish tacos from all across the country from North Carolina to California and I can safely say these are some of the best I've ever had.  Always fresh, always delicious.  The taste and consistency is on point.  The chips and corn salsa are delicious as well, although sometimes the chips are a little on the cold side.  The atmosphere is great!  It has a very trendy and hip vibe right in the heart of NoDa.  I usually try and visit earlier in the afternoon for dinner as it gets pretty busy later at night and there's usually a long wait.  It's also extremely loud when you visit during the peak hours."}
{"text":"Not only the best mexican in Charlotte, but the most fun place to eat it.  Chicken Quesadilla is awesome (I have ordered it as both an appetizer and entree in the same meal before, it is that good), colorful waitstaff, good margaritas and large selection of mexican beer at a good price.  A few months ago they had a waiter that looked and acted like captain Jack Sparrow and somehow pulled it off (although he kept calling me darling).  No reservations, be prepared to wait (only downside).  Skip the queso.  Fish taco is also solid.  Make sure you don't go on a gallery crawl night or it will be a 2+ hour wait.  Also, the hostess here is typically rude and the times they give are meaningless (we were told over two hours and called within 15 minutes) - I wish they would just take reservations or get a decent hostess)"}
{"text":"My sister and I heard this spot was featured on diners, drive Ins, and dives.  We shared the fish tacos, they were okay, the corn salsa was ok too.  But our server was pleasant.  The must interesting part of our visit was the double toilets in the ladies restroom."}
{"text":"Best Fish Tacos! Great location and friendly staff! When I lived in Ohio I could wait to visit family so I could eat here.  Now that I am a resident I eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Nope, this isn't the real deal. You want a real fish taco? Head to the Baja or the California coast. BUT, locals rave about this place. If you don't have any point of reference, then apparently it's highly recommended. It redeems itself in cold brew."}
{"text":"The BBQ Mahi Mahi Tacos are perfect. The fresh chunky salsa is delicious. The atmosphere is cool and relaxed. If you are in Charlotte this is the place you MUST try. I have not eaten anything from Cabo that wasn't delicious and the selection of local microbrews is awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Flavors are robust with an avalanche of flavors popping in your mouth. So delicious."}
{"text":"Love Cabo. Have been here a few times and although there's always a wait they have a good system where they take your cell number and text you when your table is available. Which is great! And free's you up to have a beer down the street at another establishment while you wait. The food is always good and the atmosphere is always active. If you're looking for a quiet romantic dinner this in NOT the place. My fav so far is the Lemon Shrimp Tacos. Just typing about them makes me want them! Check them out at least once. The area of NODA is pretty cool also."}
{"text":"Fresh corn salsa with tortilla chips.  The tacos and burritos are all excellent, as are the desserts.  The red velvet cake is a delicious multi-tiered confection with thick frosting.  I was disappointed to find that they have stopped serving the mashed potatoes as a side but the pasta salad was a nice substitute."}
{"text":"Very good tacos and burritos!  Went for my sister's 21st birthday! The waiter was very helpful and patient with us! She even brought out our cake for us from the freezer with a candle! The plates were very reasonably priced, $12 for my carne asada tacos. They were a little bit spicy but I'm a baby when it comes to spicy. The drinks were reasonably priced too for a cocktail-cosmo $8 with their mid grade liquor. We had an overall great experience! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went again because their tacos are amazing! Chips were so much better this time and got the lemon shrimp tacos, no complaints! Going to chalk up the bad chips to a busy night! Amazing food"}
{"text":"LOVE their tofu tacos!!! I order the sweet chili thai tofu tacos without cheese and they are the best vegan tacos I have ever had. Service is usually good, but I've also had a couple of bad experiences, otherwise I'd give it a 5."}
{"text":"everyone loves this place except me. seriously, have you seen all these reviews? people rave about this place but i think it blows.   we went there later one night after thinking about getting some fish tacos and we were basically ignored by our waiter all night, which in retrospect was probably a good thing because he looked like he was about to set the place on fire anyway and we didnt want him to start with us.  i got blackened mahi fish tacos and they were pretty bland, i didn't finish it and then we waited around to get our check for a while longer wondering if we were about to get our faces burned off by our unhappy server or our check so we could get the hell out of there. when we finally did leave (faces intact) i asked some friends if they had been to cabo fish taco and they said they loved that place.   moral of the story: i hate this place but you will probably love it forever."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was good. I had the shrimp tacos and spicy avocado pasta salad. I would definitely visit again. Oh...and they have an awesome corn dip for starters."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for tacos and beer. The service is always exceptional, and the food is amazing. Must try if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Very trendy place to get tacos. It does get pretty loud in the restaurant at peak hours. I was initially a bit skeptical about the price ($12 for 2 tacos and a side) but was very pleased with the amount of fish/meat in my meal. You are allowed to mix and match any taco on the menu, so I went with two of their specialty tacos - lemon grilled shrimp and honey soy glazed salmon. Out of the two, both were extremely flavorful and juicy, but the salmon was just cooked extremely well and the sauce was divine. I also enjoyed the semi crispy taco shells, that was a first. I think the sides could be improved, however. I got sautéed veggies as a side and they could do with a bit more flavor. But overall, a very satisfying meal.   Service was slow-ish and our server didn't seem very interested at all but it was fine.   It was hard to find free street parking on a busy night but there is a paid lot nearby."}
{"text":"I've only been once - but had to have the experience, everyone was ranting and raving about! Went during a football game, which worked out fairly well because they had many TV's and not a lot of people were at the restaurant to watch the game."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to go to Cabo Fish Taco.  I am a Foodie and good food is what i love.  That being said the food was nothing to write home about.  I had the \"world famous\" fried whitefish taco.  There was NO flavor- not in the batter not on the fish and to top it off there was sliminess that was just gross.  The crab and shrimp dip was good- but you can barely taste the crab or the shrimp.  The margaritas were Very good.  I also sampled quesedillas and they were tasty-but nothing mind blowing.  Hanging this up as-- been there done that."}
{"text":"I have been here now 5 times because it is where other people suggest meeting. I think they think it's a hip place to go because it's in Noda or something. It cannot be the food, the service or the ambiance.  And, someone please tell me WHERE THE F*** ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO PARK?"}
{"text":"Always the spot to go in Charlotte for good/unique tacos and burritos.... Great beer selection along with a couple amazing salads and sides. Check it out if you venture to Noda section of Charlotte, go once and you will return and return."}
{"text":"I moved to the Charlotte area about a year ago, and in that time frame, have eaten at Cabo Fish Taco approximately 5 times.  I originally wanted to eat here because of watching it on Triple D, and it has certainly proven to be worth the hype.  I am quite shocked at the number of mediocre to negative reviews on YELP for this restaurant (by my count it currently stands at 40% of reviews being 3 star or below).  This is, by far, one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in my life.  The BBQ Mahi and Tavura Tuna Tacos are incredible and delicious.  The Baha Shrimp dip appetizer is amazing as well.  As far as sides go, they are all good, but the Avocado Pasta Salad is the best.  I've also had the Steak-n-Cheese taco and one of the special fish tacos.  They were good also, but the real stars of this restaurant are the two tacos I mentioned above.  The wait can be bad on weekends but they use an app called NoWait that will allow you to track your wait status on your phone.  This is great compared to the normal method of buzzers because you can go wherever you want during the wait period and just track the updates on your phone.  You will get a text message when your table is ready.  Since NoDA is full of great restaurants and bars, you are able to go have a drink somewhere else while you wait for your table, then quickly walk back once you get the text that your table is ready.  The atmosphere is very chill with a Latin vibe, usually there is some reggae music in the background.  The ONLY thing this place is missing is live music, which I have not seen in my trips thus far.  I think that would really put this place into the upper echelen of chill/hang out places, but still, this is definitely a 5 star place to me.  Don't really get all the negative reviews but as they say \"haters gonna hate.\""}
{"text":"Love me the Tavaroo Tuna Tacos and the wasabi sauce is just the right heat and consistency. If the fish were any fresher, I'd say it came from the Carolina Fish Market in Ballantyne, who knows, may be it does. Any way, great place, cool vibe. The waits are a little long but that's ok, they are packed and the staff moves fast. You want fresh food and fresh fish tacos? Go here."}
{"text":"The fish is great...the corn salsa is ok and when and if you ask for regular salsa..you get the Pace Picante crap from a bottle. Seriously?? Bartenders and atmosphere are great...but not worth the wait to have to walk through bums asking for money (which is EVERY TIME)  and bottled salsa.."}
{"text":"My Wife and I have only been to Cabo Fish Taco 3 times, and we can tell you that the food is amazing, the servers and friendly, your food is served quickly, and the prices are very fair.   They start you out with the standard Tortilla Chips, but the Corn Salsa is out of this world. We absolute love the Beer Battered Shrimp Tacos w/Cilantro Sauce, and the Grilled Salmon Tacos w/ a Honey, Soy, and Wasabi Sauce.   I would recommend Cabo Fish Taco to anyone."}
{"text":"It's all about the location and funky vibe (tattoos, piercing & a few dreadlocks-no patwa). There isn't anything special on the menu (fish tacos???). Oh, that's right.. it's all in the name. The food is okay at best (over priced...must be NoDa) but the service is good. The staff is customer friendly...which really creates a comfortable environment.  Looks like a Socal beach dive has landed in NoDa. Surf's up!"}
{"text":"We came to Cabo Fish Taco while en route to our vacation in Florida and met up with a local friend of ours and his 7 month old.   Beware, put your name on the list because there's gonna be a wait. This joint is crazy popular and for good reason. It's a sizable place but they fill up fast; when we drove by, there were a ton of people waiting outside to be seated. Luckily our friend had our name on the list so we only had about a 15 minute wait by the time we arrived.  They're pretty accommodating of young families, there were a few people with babies and strollers and there's a bit of a stroller parking lot at the front. Took us a bit of finagling to figure out how we were gonna get the stroller parked so it wasn't in the way but we managed. For me, the tables here are a bit too crammed together, especially since its always full. We arrived in time for a 2:30PM lunch and it didn't quiet down by the time we left an hour later.  We all ended up going for the taco stand tacos, you get to pick any two on the menu. I went with one of the daily specials, the pork belly, and the tavarua tuna tacos (\"Blackened lemon rubbed tuna in a kiwi-pineapple fajita sauce, stuffed with avocado, mixed greens, tomato, cheese, & topped w/ honey wasabi sauce\"). We got nachos and corn salsa to snack on while we waited for our tacos. Honestly, not a fan of the corn salsa, not sure what the hype is about but I wasn't a big fan and would pass next time. The chips aren't anything special - we're used to Lone Star (Canadian mexican chain) and they give you fresh fried chips which really really make the difference.  I couldn't believe how fast the tacos came out after we ordered! My hubby got pork belly and the steak and really enjoyed his, he said the steak was almost better outside of the taco, well seasoned and properly cooked. Mine were both good, but the tavarua tacos were a bit on the spicy side for me so I wouldn't get them again. The pork belly was TO DIE FOR. So delicious, some kind of sweet honey sauce on them, I could have eaten five of those. I regretted not trying any of the deep fried tacos, if we go back I'll make a point of trying those.  My main issue with this place is that the whole experience felt really rushed. It's a busy place and its popular for a reason. But I really felt like I didn't get to truly enjoy my food because it was so hustle bustle. With the tables being as close together as they were and people passing us by in the aisles and rubbing up against my chair and that kind of thing, it really interfered with my enjoyment of the experience.  Overall, a really good spot to stop in and try if you're in Charlotte or passing through. The neighbourhood is cute, so even if you end up with a wait, you can wander around the neighbourhood and check out the shops and whatnot. We'll be back the next time we're in the state and see what else they've got to offer."}
{"text":"There will probably be a wait, especially if you go for dinner, but boy is it worth it. I've never strayed from getting the tacos and usually mix and match with whatever the speciality tacos are that day. You have to get the avocado pasta salad as a side, too.   I've had friends who have tried the burritos and quesadillas, but nothing seems to beat the tacos. Best fish tacos I've ever had. Laid back and chill atmosphere.   Eat here!!"}
{"text":"The 35 minute wait ended up being over an hour. Thankfully the areas surrounding the restaurant were entertaining enough to keep me occupied. The corn salsa was so bland that I felt the need to add a pinch of salt to each bite to experience some flavor before I gave up on it completely.   My family ordered three different dishes  1. Beer battered fish tacos had way to much batter. We could barley tell there was even fish in it 2. Chicken quesadillas were nothing more than mediocre. Chicken was very dry   3. BBQ Mahi Tacos were decent. The slaw on top was a bit overpowering but overall, it was the best out of the three dishes.   Maybe my expectations of tacos is different being from Texas, but I had heard such good things about this place that I set the bar high in my head. If I were to come back here, it would be for the environment, not so much the food."}
{"text":"Corn salsa is OK, some people love it though.   I got the special, teriyaki salmon tacos, and they were awesome. Best fish tacos I ever had.  They came with a wasabi sauce that was rather mild in flavor but satisfying.  The other fish tacos are pretty good.   Great atmosphere!  I will be back.  They always have decent drink specials too."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service. I really enjoyed my quesadilla and the queso is amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer battered shrimp taco and blackened mahi mahi taco. The avocado pasta was average but the tacos were well worth it"}
{"text":"I got here as the restaurant opened but the dining room was about 2/3 full in 30 minutes. I ate here a couple of years ago and today this place seems like a hipster haven. It reminds me of Williamsburg. I don't recall that vibe last visit. The food is still really good. Service was fast and friendly.  The tacos are fresh and the crab dip is definitely worth the trip. I like being able to mix and match taco choices because I can't pick just one. Today I had blackened Mahi and lemon shrimp.  The corn salsa is really good also. I'm not a fan of the rice and beans because it's on the dry side and the rice was kinda hard. It gets loud as the place fills up. This place is a solid 4 stars. I may pop in again for drinks before I leave town."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best fish tacos I have ever tasted....2nd only to Torchy's Tacos in TX.  The flavor was outstanding (I had one salmon taco and one tuna) and the fish was grilled to perfection.  My only complaint was that when we got our food it was lukewarm...not hot at all.  Also, I ordered the coleslaw and it was slightly flavorless."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the food (I prefer more authentic and this seems more tex mex style) but it's the tightness of the tables that keeps me away. It's just too squished and I don't enjoy it. However...it's popular and you'll probably like it. So give it a try before you decide :)"}
{"text":"Very good tacos. I had the Blackened Mahi Mahi with the Black Beans and Rice. The corn salsa and chips were a good starter. I really enjoyed it and I ll definitely return."}
{"text":"LOVE cabo fish taco!! The grilled salmon taco is my FAV!! Recently started ordering the crab dip and it's AMAZING!!! The food is full of flavor and the staff is super friendly! The food comes out quick so you're in and out but you never feel rushed. The atmosphere is laid back and carefree.  Went there last night and the salsa was too spicy to eat but everything else that we had was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love their fish tacos!! The Cajun Jamaican style is my favorite !!! The service is always good but there is always a wait!! The location is good but the parking is bad"}
{"text":"Eating at Cabo, or anywhere in NoDa on a Saturday night, is a bit of an adventure. Our most recent was on an uncharacteristically snowy evening in Charlotte, which lent the night a sort of mystical austerity, as if magic were ordained by the decent of the twinkling flakes falling all around us.  Our posse of seven put in for a table, which is no easy feat for a restaurant Cabo's size. We were told it'd be forty-five minutes, which delighted us, since that afforded time for at least six or seven glasses of wine at Dolce next door.  Scarf-ensconced, snow-laden, half-lit and stumble-happy, we received a text that our table was ready and made way for the gloomy labyrinth of NoDa's most prestigious fish taco waystation.  Echoing lively with an always handsome mix of dirty hippies, uptowners slumming it in the \"artsy\" area, and cleverly-paired retirees done up to the nines, the Cabo dining room reminds me of the background setting in a rom-com where the couple has its first hilariously awkward fight. It's somehow both romantic and unsettling... but in a good way.  Our tables were still being cleared and arranged when we walked in, so I spearheaded a mission to obtain one quick round of Dos Equis Ambers from the bar. The mission was a success. Lime-treated frothy brews in hand, we took to our table, not nearly sized for seven people, elbows bumping, thigh to thigh, alcy breath exchanging hot between us. I looked across to Huxley, that soul-stealing mermaid-haired goddess of mischief and misreason, and toothed her a goofy grin. \"I've never felt closer to all of you,\" I said.  Our waitress came up, god bless her, pale and long, sheer gray cotton draped snug and purposeful around the rolling chalice of her body, shoulders high and firm, chopped blonde chin-cut springing around the soft features of her face... AJ kicked my shin under the table and shot me a wide-eyed, closed-mouth stare. He knows my type.  Huxley sneered. With rich voice, full and lively, our waitress greeted us, accepted my immediate request for more beers, and then sold us, vividly, on the day's specials - southwestern style fried oysters appetizer (it has long been established that I and Mine are suckers for oysters in any condition), rainbow trout wraps with black-beans and a spicy sauce, or some whitefish taco that I'm pretty sure she called \"Drunk Fish\". We ordered several of each.  In a brilliant flash, she was back with the beers. I doled them out with jittering hands, all aslosh and messy. We toasted the night, \"To fish tacos and our semi-annual snowfall!\" As glasses clanked together, we heard a crashing thud against the front glass of the dining room. Outside in the street, a band of scrawny hipsters were engaging in an epic snowball fight. Our waitress walked past and startled at the noise; she turned toward us and laughed. \"We should be out there with them,\" AJ said. He motioned to the waitress. \"So should you!\" I nodded in enthusiastic agreement. She giggled and said she was totally into it... but we were too focused on food and drink to actually break out into an impromptu snowball fight at that moment, unreasonably attractive waitress participant notwithstanding.  While we waited for our entrees, we gorged on oysters and Dos Equis, and told each other, plainly, how badly and intensely we were all in love. Whilst perusing the margaritas menu, Nellie and I had a gruesome conversation about our respective past experiences that have led to our present inability to conceive of anything containing Tequila.  And then, the food. Oh glorious frozen twinkling mad and descending all around us. Assaulted by flavors, the trout, dear god that trout... it fell apart in our mouths like a shattered dream... and the drunk fish, drunk fish as it was, moist and white and flaky pure, all dressed up in spice and glaze, oozing, flowing, plates exchanges and forkfulls shared, cheeks stained and scarves like napkins, and flickering votives and cream stuck in beards and delicate fingers soaked through by the morsels they gripped.  Hux reached across the table, fetched my chin, and with the most deft and subtle movements of her spiderlike fingers, tipped away some flake or smear that I had smattered about my face. \"I'm always a mess,\" I said. She smiled that cutting smile. \"That's why we work together; I'm always flawless.\" Our gray-wrapped wedge-cut goldilocks came back. \"How should I split this up?\" she asked.  \"Look at us, doll,\" I said to her before glancing back around the table. \"We're all in this together.\"  She grinned a pearly grin. \"So, that's one check then?\" I nodded.  Outside, drunk and full and spinning wild, I held the door for my men and my ladies. As I turned to face the street, I caught a cold, hard ball of fresh-packed snow right to the left eye socket. I cursed and coiled over. As my vision cleared and sensation returned to my cheek, I looked up to see Huxley laughing maniacally and dusting snow off her palms.  \"Thanks for dinner,\" she said."}
{"text":"Best fish taco's in charlotte. Even better than any taco joint I've eaten at when I lived in SoCal."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST tuna tacos! My boyfriend and I stopped in last week for tacos and cocktails, and both of us were completely blown away with their tuna tacos! Everything we have ever tried here has been amazing! The service is really hit or miss though...half of the times the service has been fantastic, the other half of the times we have gotten stuck with a server that slowly mopes around and looks like they would rather be anywhere but there.  I give it four stars because the food is just so darn good, but the inconsistency in service is really frustrating."}
{"text":"Hip place in Noda-lots if atmosphere surrounding it-fun people watching and shopping place.     Best fish tacos in the area. 0out table Had grilled shrimp tacos, white fish tacos and ahi tuna tacos-all great. Avocado pasta salad as a side-local beer on tap.   Parking in the street. Casual and family friendly."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing it on \"triple D\" with Guy Fieri and he hype settled down. This place certainly did not disappoint! We were fortunate to have only a short wait, and even got a parking space right in front!   Loved the vibe of the place, reminded me of my old town Berkeley. A hipster joint and friendly crowd! My spouse had the fish tacos and I had the beer battered white fish tacos. Both were superb. I paired my white fish tacos with a nice local serving of Triple C Brewing 3C IPA, given by our hostess' recommendation. Stupendous.  Menu is extensive. I can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food is amazing and super filling. The amount you pay and the amount of food you get is worth it. I would definitely recommend Cabo Fish Taco to others and I would go again!"}
{"text":"Awesome. BBQ mahi tacos are a must try. Crab dip is awesome too. Have good specials daily. Always busy so plan accordingly. Good drink selection. Staff is friendly. Food comes out quick. Chips and salsa leave something to be desired. Chips are always stale."}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte from out of town and came to Cabo on Saturday night for dinner... they quoted us a 30-45 min wait, so we went across the street and grabbed a beer. And they called us right away to get seated! So our wait was really only 5 min... but we weren't ready to sacrifice our beers - Cabo was understanding and put us at the top of the list when we finished and came back. Inside is loud, and they were busy! There were big groups there, and mostly younger people/couples but also families.   Ok no beating around the bush: THE CRAB DIP! We all agreed that this hands down was the best dish we had all weekend. The warm semi-soft/semi-fried pita chips were so perfect and the dip was so tasty! We were still talking about this days later. The chips were so so good and come with a corn pico. I was honestly full before dinner. Margaritas were tasty, not all that strong though.   I think our server forgot about us or forgot to put our order in because we waited an uncomfortable amount of time before our food came out. My friend (Charlotte resident) said food is usually super quick to come out! So our service was a little disappointing.   I ordered the fried fish tacos Because the restaurant is called Cabo Fish Taco so how could I NOT order a fish taco! Crispy and HUGE! I had to take a whole taco and most of my side home. I had the avocado pasta salad, which was decent. I don't really think it's \"spicy\" as it's named. There were just large chunks of jalapenos that gave it a kick but 95% of it was just a regular pasta salad! People on Yelp seem to love it but it was pretty ordinary to me! My date and friend loved their steak tacos! Definitely a good value for the quality/quantity of food that you get!"}
{"text":"Was very leery of a fish-taco place... but I am sold!!! I am trying to talk my other half into giving it a go...and I am betting he will be converted too! Went with a friend who knows all the out of the way, non-chain places to eat. Had the corn salsa-yum! Liked the beer-batter fish. Very crowded, not big on the \"ambience\"...but it was soooo good!"}
{"text":"It's great!!! Try the Lemon Grilled Shrimp tacos!!! And they have skinny girl margaritas!!! It's a tad growded but it didn't bother us.  We waited only for 30 min."}
{"text":"I came by for a visit based on recommendations from fellow YELPers.  The place was packed for dinner, so I sat at the bar.  They have two bars, one in front, one in the other side of the restaurant.  The place was very busy, and pretty loud.  That's fine, it's just that kind of place.  The sidewalk patio seating looked GREAT but, it was full so, I couldn't enjoy the people watching.  I ordered the special, based on recommendation from the bar tender, the Tuna Wrap.  It was basically a tuna sandwich in a tortilla....sounds lame  but, it wasn't.  the Tuna salad was very nicely spiced and the wrap was quite good.  Very generous portion but, I was hungry!!! what could I do?  I ate the whole darn thing (oink oink)  The beer selection was nice, with a variety of local brews, as well as commercial taps and specialty beers.  Service at the bar was good.  The bartender was VERY experienced and knew what he was doing.  Friendly, good at small talk but, not annoying and bothering too much.  The ambiance....meh.  Take it or leave it.  Too \"themed\" for my own tastes but, that's just the kind of place it is.  I would definitely come here again, especially with friends for dinner before night on the town  Hint:  Plan on waiting if you come at peak times...the place was very busy during dinner, as well as lunch when I strolled by earlier in the day.  Not sure if they take reservations....worth a call to find out."}
{"text":"The Baja shrimp and crab dip is delicious!! The tacos were amazing as well! I will def be back here soon! The atmosphere is really cool!"}
{"text":"I love Cabo Fish Taco, the atmosphere is great and the decoration is cool but most important the food is awesome. I don't eat meat and they offer a great variety of fresh fish tacos, I love the Honey Soy Glazed Salmon Tacos and the Sweet Thai Chili Tofu tacos as well.  I have been several times and always the service has been good, attentive and really fast!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what all the hype is about.  The crab and shrimp dip is amazing and next time, that will be my entree.  My hubby got the tuvaroo (however that is spelled) wahoo tacos and they were really good, but too spicy for me.  I got the beer battered white fish tacos.  They were tasty but stone cold.  Like, the fresh from the cooler.  The place is super loud, unless you are lucky enough to be seated outside, and our table was literally in the doorway between the bar and the dining room.  I might get take out next time, if there is a next time."}
{"text":"I have now been here twice in the month I've lived in Charlotte. Both times I have gone with family. The first time my aunt and I shared so we could try two things.  I got the chicken and shrimp burrito which was more than filling and she got the bbq mahi tacos which were so full of fish, you could hardly pick them up! The second time I returned and got the BBQ Mahi tacos because I liked them so much. Ended up bringing enough food home from our table that I had two other meals (brought home two tacos). This week I was there on Thursday night and we had just beat the crowd. They had 1/2 off NC Draft beers which was awesome! I will definitely return again soon!"}
{"text":"I went to Cabo about a week ago and I still can't stop thinking about the shrimp tacos. I've never thought about a taco this much in my life. I fall asleep thinking about it every night. This is truly a piece of art located in the heart of the art district. I would recommend this restaurant to every person I meet. I would write poetry about the shrimp taco... If I was any good at poetry. Here, I'll give it a try here's a haiku:   Cabo's shrimp tacos, They changed my life forever, A perfect evening!"}
{"text":"1 star for many reasons: SO LOUD, sat us outside and there's no vent that actually keeps cool air in, the salad was horrible, and the waitress was the worst ever.   I (did) love cabo fish taco but last night was a really bad experience. My friend got there minutes before me (so a table for two) and they refused to sit her. It was a weeknight (a Wednesday) at 7pm.  I got there and she told the hostess that we were both there and she then told us we would have to wait. Mind you, there wasn't a wait when my friend got there. So, we had to wait even more. They got our name and phone number.  10-15min later, they texted us so we came to the door. The hostess ignored us as her and her coworker were telling a patron about seating options for a large party. She looked at my friend (who she has now seen 3-4 times) with the look of \"what are you doing here?\" I've never seen such  a horrible waitress before.  Also, the salads are horrible. I got the tuna one and it was gross. Not worth the $12. Just stick with a margarita and queso."}
{"text":"Fish and carne asada tacos were excellent, salsa was good, atmosphere excellent, highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place always delivers! I love the Tavaroo fish taco and I never get tired of it. Great beer selection as well. I've never had a problem with the staff either they are very friendly."}
{"text":"By far my favorite taco spot.  Not the place to go for authentic Mexican but, it hits the spot of you're craving a taste of California."}
{"text":"The food, service and atmosphere are great here. As a visitor to Charlotte I am only sad that I cant eat here every weekend!  But when I do visit, its on my list of must do's!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few times and always enjoyed my food and the atmosphere. It can be a very busy place, mostly on weekends. The service had always been good.  I would go back, just not my favorite type of food.  Overall a good experience though."}
{"text":"Meh.  Yeah, that's about right.  The atmosphere at CFT is fun, and I really like the vibe in NoDa.  That being said, the food and the service at CFT leave a lot to be desired.  We ordered fish tacos (what else?) - I had the blackened Mahi and my friend had the breaded whitefish.  The whitefish on her tacos was completely bland, and the breading was far too thick for fish that was to be served on tacos.  My tacos were better - the Mahi-Mahi was actually pretty tasty - but unfortunately nothing was hot.  The rice and beans were lukewarm, and the tacos didn't even come out that hot.  Not appealing at all.  The corn salsa that is served to you when you sit down is really unimpressive, too.  The chips are tasty, but the salsa is totally worthless.  The worst part of CFT was the service.  I don't know if she was just having a bad day, but our server was down right rude.  On more than one occasion I thanked her for bringing me something (my food or a beer) only to have her say nothing in return.  I was not at all impressed.  Moreover, I would have liked to have ordered another beer.  I just wasn't given the opportunity to do so until we were done with everything.  I will probably go back, for I did find the atmosphere to be fun, but if it isn't better on the next visit then I think I will be done with CFT."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place for a long time, so I wanted to try it out. We shared two tacos, calamari and fish, they were really good, tasty, fresh and homemade. We also had deserts, they tasted average, were expensives and I don't think they were homemade."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere in a funky area.  Start at Cabo for a yummy fish taco dinner.  Whatever flavor you like, they have it!  The service is top notch!  They have a faine assortments of local brews.  I personally eat low-carb so they brought me everything without the rice.  I skip the tortillas which were homemade but looked/felt they might have been a bit tough and chewy.  Terrific dinner, head over to Growlers across the stree for a home brew and down the way to Amelies for a dessert (to go, because I am a pumpkin in the evening), and you have yourself a fine evening planned indeed!"}
{"text":"This place has really lost what they once had.   I believe the increase in business in the Noda area has occurred and they can't manage it correctly.   The Mai burrito was pretty good but the rice was cold and the chips were stale.   My suggestion is go else where in Noda,  there are too many better options"}
{"text":"When we went two years ago, the food was amazing. Last month, we were both completely underwhelmed. Don't know what happened here, but the service was lacking and the food was bland. It was disappointing after having such fond memories of the place."}
{"text":"I use to really love this place.  The tacos, the beer, the atmosphere... that said it is still OK but not what it once was.  The food has been kind of bland the last few times I have visited and the service has been iffy.  Hopefully, they will wake up and get back to there roots.  I miss the way it use to be."}
{"text":"EDIT: I have to drop this to 3 stars.  A restaurant just has to be consistent and CFT is anything but that.  I went today and my food was just so-so (everything we ordered) and it's not the first time.   This place is awesome.  A lot of creative choices other than just fish tacos too - my favorite being the Carne Asada tacos.  The price's are reasonable and the atmosphere is pretty chill and down to earth - but nothing special.  I don't think it matters - if you're like me you come here for the food and to have a few brews while hanging out in the NODA area.    So what's holding me back from giving 5 stars?  I'm not factoring in atmosphere, meal presentation, etc because this isn't that kind of place.  And the price's reflect that.  So purely based on food - the sides are very average. The chips and salsa are OK (although complimentary as in most mex-american joints).  And while the main entrees are definetely tasty, they're not \"out of this world\" good.  Still, I'm always up for some Cabo Fish Taco and they get a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"I couldn't have asked for a better first meal in Charlotte! First of all the NODA area of Charlotte is simply amazing! Such a huge melting pot of cultures there, and great shops! Front and center I found Cabo Fish Taco and decided to eat there. Taco's are my favorite food ever!   I tried the salmon taco and the lemon pepper shrimp I couldn't tell you which was better because they were both AMAZING! I also had a pineapple hard cider which blew my mind.   Definitely check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Awesome Baja style fish tacos, jalapeño mashed potatoes are a must and great tequila bar too. Great value and awesome atmosphere in the NoDa area of Charlotte. Must go if you're in the city."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it!  Great local tap beers and wonderful shrimp tacos.  I would recommend the grilled shrimp over the fried, but that all comes down to preference.  I hear it can get pretty busy on a Friday/Saturday night so I would suggest going for lunch or on a week night.  If you don't mind a crowd then go anytime!"}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions, most recently for Cinco de Mayo. The service is always right on target and the food is consistently flavorful. It gets busy here often, so be prepared to wait in the evenings. My only complaint is that the tap water was awful today. That might be a ploy to get you to buy a drink. It worked on me. You can't go wrong with any meal here."}
{"text":"This place is a decent spot to get food if you're on Davidson Street, but honestly there are much better tacos in Charlotte. I say this, and I really want to like this place, but honestly, most of their food is lackluster, bland (or way too spicy/overseasoned) or greasy. Maybe I just haven't had good meals here, but no one in our party was blown away by the food...except the seafood dip and guac, those were both on point!   I ordered the battered fish and shrimp tacos (one of each), with a side of rice and beans. My shell was so greasy that it was almost translucent and all the shrimp and veggies fell right out of it. I spent more time wiping my hands than I did enjoying the taco. The shrimp itself was delicious, but nearly impossible to eat in taco form. The fish, on the other hand, spent a little too long in the fryer, and honestly, just tasted like oil. I didn't even finish that taco. My rice in my rice and beans was still crunchy and other friends at the table had the same complaint. The avocado pasta salad, was spicy, but flavorful, so that was a bonus. Drink wise, stick to beer, as everyone at our table felt the margaritas were heavy on the sour mix, rather than a balanced margarita. Overall, I've given this place three chances since moving to Charlotte, and I think it's three strikes, you're out. Sorry Cabo, but I'll be taking my taco cravings elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! I don't usually give five stars but this place was a fresh breath of air.  From the hostess to the waitstaff and manager, we were taken care of for our entire lunch. Best tacos I have ever eaten.... BBQ Mahi Mahi!!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best taco I've had in my life. Mahi mahi bbq taco is a must. Their pasta avocado side is really good as well. Highly recommend everything here :)"}
{"text":"I was there on a Thursday.  at 7:30, there was a 20 minute wait for us (party of two).  I thought the nachos were a bit stale, but overall, it was a great night."}
{"text":"Great tacos!!!!!   The shrimp and steak tacos are the best.  The best side is the spicy avocado pasta salad.  Their tomatillo sauce is delicious as well.  Truly one of our favorite places in NODA.  The drinks are great too.  Get there early because the wait is long...but well worth is.  Also, this place is awesome to get together with family or friends."}
{"text":"I was visiting my good friend from Charlotte this past weekend. She proclaimed that, no matter how long the wait, we HAD to go to Cabo. I was a little tired from the 2 and a half hour drive, but reluctantly agreed to brave the wait (which was 45 minutes). We were able to get a place at the bar and were immediately given chips and corn salsa. I was a bit disappointed when I looked at their drink menu and saw it full of my \"NEVER drink of choice\"... margaritas. However, my friend told me I HAD to try a margarita (peer pressure...), so I went with the Purple Haze (no salt). It was actually delicious--a little sweet and not overly \"tequila\" tasting. The bartenders were very nice--two of them offered to serve us dinner at the bar so we didn't have to keep waiting. We decided to wait for a table, which worked out pretty well, because after we ordered our second round, the hostess called our name to be seated. With the excellent bar service and upbeat atmosphere, the 45-minute wait didn't feel very long at all.  When we sat down at our table, our waiter immediately greeted us with more chips and salsa (not like I needed anymore...). We asked for water, and he brought us that in under a minute. During our wait, I glanced at a menu, so I already knew what I wanted (the blackened mahi-mahi tacos). We ordered our food and seriously (I am not kidding) 5 minutes (tops) later, our food was at our table. We were both shocked. I mean, I guess tacos aren't that difficult to make, but that is still impressive for a very crowded restaurant. I had the herb mashed potatoes as a side, which were very good. I absolutely loved the mahi-mahi tacos--and the tortillas (I believe they make them in-house) were delicious. Unfortunately, I was a little full from drinks and chips earlier and wasn't able to finish my food, but I definitely would have if I had the room (this is saying a lot...I'm rarely able to eat a whole meal in its entirety!). Our waiter brought us our checks when it was evident that we were done eating, and even made the effort to refill my friend's water after we had already cashed out. It was nice to feel like we weren't forgotten because we already paid. I left Cabo Fish Taco very full and very much so wishing there was one in Chapel Hill! I definitely recommend it for anyone that loves seafood--even if there is a 45 minute wait!"}
{"text":"Pros: Good salsa Good location  Cons: Insane wait for not that great of food  Bad chips, always stale  Bad service Not that great of a venue No parking Bad service Margarita is overpriced and weak  For as much as everyone talks this place up, I was very disappointed. Long story short.. I'll pass."}
{"text":"Excellent food and ambience. I had the BBQ mahi tacos. The crab dip should be called crack dip as we couldn't stop eating it--it was so delicious! Great margaritas! Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I got the beer battered fish tacos but I don't know if there was actually any fish in there or if it was just beer batter. I was very disappointed after all the great things I've heard about this place. I'll probably give it one more shot- maybe it was just what I ordered."}
{"text":"Food is always great. They are getting better with the wait time. But goodness it is always freezing and extremely loud music...bring a jacket and be ready ready to yell to have a convo. But hey great food."}
{"text":"have been wanting to go to this place every time i go to the Johnston YMCA.. but only coz i dint wanna bury myself in guilt for eating out just after gyming id drive past! yest finally hubby n me decided to give this place a shot! the place has a nice upbeat feel....rustic furniture and good music with dim lights give it a nice atmosphere! we ordered the pita points with guacamole! that was nice and fresh. then got the bbq mahi taco! oh that was yumm...i was excite dto taste the mango bbq sauce and the white cilantro sauce! am ot too fond of the fish taste being very evident in dishes...this was just perfect! we also got their dessert special..a white choc craneberry cake! it was heavemly..i licked the plate clean!"}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Mexico and experienced a real fish taco (which usually runs around 50¢) then you know Cabo is a giant poser.  They charge mucho dollars for crappy food. The seafood is ALWAYS overcooked. Seafood is delicate and should be flaky and light. Not fried hard as sh!t. I've been there thrice, all for lunch, and it's very inconsistent. Sometimes bland, sometimes very salty, sometimes seared, sometimes forgotten on the stove. The tacos are always drowning in some mystery grease, everything gets some kind of f%@king mayonnaise on it, and the complementary salsa is canned corn with NO FLAVOR.  The place is in a great location, with a great atmosphere, but the food is  just not that good.  Hey Cabo Fish Taco! Go to Mexico and do a work study..."}
{"text":"This is a very cool spot. I thought the atmosphere was very nice. It had a very authentic Mexican appeal with the furnishings, etc.   The drinks were 'OK' priced..the pre-meal complimentary salsa and chips were fantastic. I asked if they were fat and calorie free..and the waitress assured me that they were not...but the salsa was very fresh.  The tacos I ordered were good...seemed a bit dry, but I'm not sure exactly how juicy fish can be...it was my first time enjoying fish in a taco..so it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. This place is very average. The first time I had something fried with the cilantro white sauce - I thought the sauce was way too much and the fried fish was flavorless - did not ever want to go back. Needless to say, I returned. The salsa is very bland, literally just a little bowl of corn and diced tomatoes? I tried 3 of the tacos on my recent trip - the lemon grilled shrimp easily the best but in the larger scheme of things just average, the bbq mahi tacos ok - a lot of flavor, seemingly none of it fish, and the beer battered shrimp tacos pretty Captain D's-esque. The pecan pie was nice and gooey, but the flavor was a tad too sugary. And the red velvet cake was tasty with a good middle layer, but a strange gelatinous top layer."}
{"text":"SMH....Keep in mind I lived on the west coast in the mexican food capital of the United States (AZ). There was one bartender on a Saturday night, who was not only serving people at his bar, but he was making drinks for the enitre restuaraunt (which was full), answering phones and taking to go orders. Because of this, it was not the best service.  However, food was worst.  The salsa (whatever you call that) was not authentic, not good and very bland. The queso was OK! and my fist taco was just bland and not good.  The ingrediants that make Mexican food special are a combination of  citurs (lemon, lime), garlic, cilantro and salt. None of  which was present in any of the food!"}
{"text":"First off, this place was on tripple d. Amazing food! Great service! Get the tav-a-roo tuna tacos!"}
{"text":"When I saw this restaurant featured on diners, drive ins, and dives, it looked like the most amazing fish taco I could ever eat...it was good but just ok, I was def let down"}
{"text":"First on service:  The wait was very long and we got the feeling that we were being skipped, but we may have just been paranoid.  Once we got in, the service was fantastic.  Our waitress and accommodating and anticipated a lot of our requests.  Second on the food: Two of the three things my girlfriend and I ordered were disappointing, the third was incredible.  Lets start with the bad:  the guacamole looked very manufactured.  It effectively was a scoop of avocado (clearly scooped from a large container) with a number of other toppings (jalapeno, onion, NO tomato) scattered on top.  It took work to mix it into guacamole and still wasn't that good.  The BBQ Mahi Tacos were drowned in a white mayonaisey sauce, which was way too heavy. On the positive side, the Tavarua were incredible.  The Wasabi was perfectly proportioned and the taste was delicate and delicious."}
{"text":"While on a trip to Charlotte, we visited this restaurant because we had seen it on Diners, Drive In, and Dives.   Because of the time of day we went, we got in with no wait at all. The salsa we got before the meal was very fresh and very good. The Beer Battered Shrimp Tacos were excellent. It was with worth searching out this restaurant because it was worth the hype.   My only complaint is that since I do not live in Charlotte, I cannot have these tacos more often."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Food out in a timely manner, our server checked on us several times and then other wait staff checked on us several times."}
{"text":"I cannot express to you how much I love this place. it is a bit noisy, crowded at times, however the menu is excellent, the service is incredible, the food is fresh and the presentation is perfect. One of my favorite spots in one of my favorite sides of town."}
{"text":"Had Tuna Taco and pasta salad.  Fantastic and even though only 2 tacos the portions were good size.  Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"My first time here I came with Pourina and I will say that it was quite bland.  The place was under construction and overall I was disappointed for my first time having fish tacos.  In the past two weeks I've frequented this place and I absolutely love it!  With the patio outside and this nice weather we've had lately it is such a cool place to chill.  The crowd seems kinda hip in the way Noda usually is and the service has been decent recently.  Again the patio is cool as hell, I don't know why I like it so much.  I want to go on a sunday, smoke my cigar, drink corona, eat some tacos, and play cards with friends out there.    Now the food, FAR better than my first time.  I've had a few things but I keep going back to the Tuna tacos with wasabi honey sauce. I forget the name of them but its the bottom of menu, its off the chizzzzzzzzzain!  Seriously, can't say much for the rest of the menu but those Tuna Tacos are the heat."}
{"text":"BBQ Mahi Tacos are the way to go!!!!! I got mahi two ways- one BBQ, one blackened. The BBQ was incredible!!!!!! I didn't love the pasta salad side."}
{"text":"So I have been here before and I do like this place but the wait is so long. It isn't there fault as this is one of the best restaurants in NODA. What is cool is that it is in the heart of NODA so you can grab a drink some where else while waiting or walk around and get a look of the colorful artwork.   I am trying out vegan now so I was shocked at the options I did have for that lifestyle . . People who love guacamole! You found your new place to love guacamole!!  Now for non vegan people you need to try the fish tacos! Delicious!   The atmosphere is cool but a little small on the inside as this adds to the wait . It has a good word of mouth and some people go insane over this place and I understand why too. I have eaten at a lot places and I still recommend here all the time. Just be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times and the food never disappoints.  I had the shrimp fajitas and will get fajitas from this day forward....SOOOOO GOOD! I would suggest a new salsa for the chips they start you off with...it's like a corn relish with no flavor. And the sweet tea wasn't very sweet. Every place has an off night especially as packed as it was. I would still come back, definitely! It's a great \"hang out with your friends\" kind of place."}
{"text":"Food here is absolutely delicious, aside from the corn salsa they give you. I tried the Thai shrimp wrap, it was slightly spicy, but still so good! They also have good drink specials on Sunday's which is the day I went. The only complaint is that the drinks are a little pricey. But overall delicious!"}
{"text":"I went this passed weekend with some friends (12 of us) and didn't think about the fact it was Saturday night. So we got there at 8:00p and were told it was a 90 minute wait.   Realizing every place would have a wait we decided to stick around. We were seated in 25 minutes (party of 12, on a Sat night)   The service was good, and the food was really good. I would recommend the 'beer battered white fish' hands down the best thing there. I asked for their 3 'best dishes' and the beer battered white fish was awesome!  It was a little loud in there so it made it hard to talk with folks at the table and it was kind of dark, we needed to use our phones to read the menus... Small price to pay for great fish tacos."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been working our way through the Diners, Drives-Ins, and Dives featured restaurants, albeit slowly.  Today we dropped off our girl at Pit Road Bar & Grill (another interesting DDD featured choice... an indoor go-cart place) for a birthday party and hightailed it to Cabo Fish Taco in NoDa.    I scanned the Yelp reviews on the way and noticed a trend.  Get the BBQ tilapa taco, get the tuna tilapia, get the crab dip appetizer, get Michelle as your server.  Since her birthday party was early in the day we stopped in around 11:45 am on a Saturday.  Parking was light and we found a great street spot with no problem.  Walked in to rather snippy hostess who walked us to a miniature table for two (I mention this because every single other couple was seated at a table for four).    Everything changed then because we got...Michelle...as our server.  I got stitches in my hand recently and what was a crappy doctor visit became good because the the PA who stitched me up was awesome.  Same thing here... if you go to CFT, you want Michelle, she's awesome.  I listened to the other servers making their presentations, but they just weren't the same.  She knows her stuff and has personality, to boot.  I like to tell servers when it's my first visit.  Yes, I've done my homework online first.  Yes, I generally know my order.  But I care about their opinion.  Michelle's face brightened up when I said it was our first visit and she walked us through the menu.  Interestingly, it generally mimicked what I found on here from the reviewers.  Get the tacos, she said, for your first time.  Get the BBQ mahi mahi, get the wasabi tuna.  Get the crab dip starter.  Ok, then, sounds perfect.  My husband, who loves to challenge me to see if he can order the best meal when we go out orders the wasabi tuna (avarua (Tav-A-Roo) Tuna Tacos $11.50 Blackened lemon rubbed tuna in a kiwi-pineapple fajita sauce, stuffed with lettuce, tomato, mixed cheeses & topped with our honey wasabi sauce.) OMG.  He wins. He so freakin wins.  For $12.95 you can mix and match two tacos.  So I, following Yelp reviewers, order 1 Tilapia taco (Grilled mango BBQ mahi-mahi tacos stuffed with cabo slaw, tomato, avocado, mixed cheeses & finished with our cilantro white sauce.) and 1 Carne Asada taco (Grilled steak sauteed in a roasted red tomato sauce with peppers & onions, stuffed with lettuce, tomato & mixed cheeses.)  They were both good, very good.  But Todd still wins.    The tuna tacos are AMAZING.  He got medium which was a smidgey pink in the middle.  The tilapia, which reviewers seemed to love the most, was fine. I won't get it again.  I preferred the carne asada but wasn't fond of he peppers and onions.  All tacos are fork and knife.  No need to pick up.  They are overfilled and waaaaaay more than needed for lunch.  Since I love restaurant leftovers, this was a plus for me and a plus for my wallet.  The crab dip turned out to be crab and shrimp dip with outrageous deep-fried pita corners that had just come out of the fryer.  I commented on how bad they were for me and then ate about 1000 of them. It came out just minutes after ordering, piping hot, with a very, very generous serving amount, we took this home, too.    We were given a fresh salsa and chips upon being seated, a combination of roasted corn, tomatoes and scant seasoning.  I'd recommend ordering an appetizer because the chips were the bagged chip variety, cold, and the salsa extremely bland.  For sides, we got the refried beans (yummy) and the seasonal side which was jalapeno mashed potatoes.  They had some real kick to them so be prepared.  They were cold though so I wasn't really a fan.  Have you ever gone to bed thinking about your meal and your leftovers waiting in the fridge?  I went up to do ironing and then eventually gave in to come back down to snack because I wanted the crab dip and Todd's wasabi tuna tacos.  Obsessively so. This is a big rave.  I'm going back."}
{"text":"Wow!! What a meal!! I had the carne asada burrito and it was BURSTING with flavor!! The black beans and rice were awesome as well. My steak was cooked so perfect it was juicy and tender. My fiance had the special trout tacos and he said they were super tasty and the fish was perfect. On top of that, our waitress was good too, she made sure my cup was always full and attendted to us the right amount of times. I am so impressed and will most definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin who was visiting from Fort Bragg because I had heard solid reviews from others. He got the Mahi Mahi tacos which he said were average. The fish was bland and not particularly anything to write home about.  I had the chicken tacos which were so watery that the tortilla they came on was soggy, damp and crumbling apart before it even reached my table. That should've been my first sign.  There must have been an entire handful of chives in the tacos. I ended up having to spend five minutes picking enough out so I could actually taste the meat.  Anyway, I ate a good portion of the tacos and began feeling sick about 45 minutes later. Spent the next two days in bed feeling miserable.  I will never go back here."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was craptastic.  Knew it was going to be bad when our waitress first asks if we are ready to order, we give a cheery 'yes', and  she responds by walking to another table, returning 10 minutes later.   It didn't get better."}
{"text":"Our service was Great. But Cabo is slipping. 3 baskets of stale chips later, and our dishes were microwaved from frozen. Just awful awful food... gross to the point we couldn't eat it. We said nothing to our super sweet attentive waitress - but the food was so bad - we went and vomited later.  So bad. Pre made and reheated disgusting piles of pure shit.  Please- please redeem yourselves Cabo. You were so much better than this. Today was one of the worst dining experiences based on Food alone I've ever had."}
{"text":"GREAT place... service was 5 stars, sangria was spectacular... great menu and food.. but the crab dip was CRAZY good, do NOT skip it!! The pita chips with it were AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Place is usually busy at peak times but if you try 11:30am and 5:30pm to beat the crowds you can do it pretty easy. I've eaten here five times and every time has been about the same. Service is good, food is good and the corn salsa is really good. I've always eaten some type of taco. Usually mahi or tuna and the flavor combo's are spot on. The one thing I don't like is how greasy the taco shells are now. I didn't even eat the taco shells the past two times and used a fork to eat the inside portion. I think the next time I go I'll order something with out a shell."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to Cabo Fish Taco for many moons and never got around to it. NoDa, despite all it has to offer, is not a neighborhood I frequent. On this night a group of us were celebrating Becky's birthday and our original destination was actually Heist Brewery. The friendly staff at Heist told us that we had a two hour wait so we decided to skip Heist since we were all pretty hungry.  Cabo was packed, and originally we were told there was a 20 minute wait. Fortunately they told us the bar was open so we opted for that option. Ultimately we ended up eating at the bar since we didn't want to wait for a table.  The atmosphere is cool and hipster, not unlike anything else you'd expect in NoDa. The décor was great and the restaurant is ample. I especially loved the ceilings which had been untouched for quite some time and still had the original  The first thing they brought us was this corn-based pico de gallo-style salsa. I've never seen this style of salsa with so much corn but it was great. For my taste though, I could have done with 50% less corn and add maybe a little bit of cabbage instead. Chips were nice too, nothing special.  I ordered the wasabi tuna burrito which was excellent. No complaints at all. It would have never occurred to me to wrap those ingredients and wrap them in a flour tortilla to make them a burrito but it was one of the better dishes I've had lately. The wasabi was there... boom! Front and center in every bite. My tuna was perfectly cooked with a lot of pink in the middle and the avocado sent the whole thing to rock stardom.  Becky ordered the same but in taco form.  The beer selection was decent, as many other eateries in the area they seem to have dedicated a few tabs to local/regional breweries which is always nice to see (although lately it seems that our own loyalty to the local/regional breweries is limiting the availability of other small/medium breweries, oh well). I had one of Birdsong's Jalapeño Pale Ale (what else will you have with a wasabi tuna burrito?!).  Loved Cabo Fish Taco and want to go back to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"New resident in NoDa so checking out the local spots. Cabo is very alluring I mean who doesn't love fish & taco then add them together and it's heaven in a taco  .  Ordered the Jerk Grouper taco with a mango & misc salsa (there was other stuff in the salsa but mango was the king) which was freaking amazing. You get 2 huge soft tacos with a side which I got the avocado salad which is a pasta also freaking amazing . Cabo gives a very laid back vibe and the atmosphere has a Caribbean feel and tons of unique art which includes Bob Marley (4/20 ). The rice and beans as a side were also tasty so I recommend those as well.  Our waitress was very attentive and thank goodness cause that jerk snuck up on me and slapped me like 3 times lol but it was worth it.   The only thing missing from Cabo is a live band, group of friends and some libations lol."}
{"text":"By far the most famous restaurant in NoDa no thanks to some famous tv show I'm sure you already heard about. If you want to know if they play up to the hype then just look outside literally any night and you'll see groups of people waiting to grab a table.   Their taco game is on point here ... notice the name. You can't go wrong ordering them. Just two tacos with a side will probably fill you up! I've been branching out and trying new things recently like their burrito which was great!   Prices aren't bad and they have good beer specials too! Don't hesitate to ask your wait staff for suggestions!   Setting reservations for weekends is probably your best bet but during the week I wouldn't expect a huge wait if it's less than 4 people. They have a solid amount of indoor seating and probably about 8 tables on their street side patio. Perfect way to start a night in NoDa!"}
{"text":"This is my first checking however it will not be my last. The food here was scrumptious I had the beer battered fish and carne Asada tacos they were quite scrummy - the family have an arrangement of tacos and everyone was equally as impressed I agree that the avocado pasta salad is fantastic and I shall look forward to returning"}
{"text":"My husband and I always have dinner here when we come to Charlotte. We LOVE this place! The shrimp and crab dip with the pita bread is to die for and the tacos are great! Upon our server's suggestion, my husband and I each opted for the Honey Wasabi Salmon Tacos. After one bite, we looked at each other and said \"WOW - these are delicious!\". I can't believe we hadn't tried these before! The best tacos we have ever had. Service was great. My husband is a craft beer snob, LOL, and he says that the craft beer selection is decent. Thanks for the recommendation - it is our new favorite item! We will have to come more often to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"One of NODAs hot spots!  I have been to Cabo Fish Taco for the last few years.  This place is AWESOMELY delicious!  Let's start from the very beginning...when you sit down, you are greeted by some chips and salsa.  But not just any kind of salsa, corn salsa.  The salsa is a good mix of sweet and regular salsa-y.  The chips add a nice saltiness to it.  Then the margaritas are refreshing with a good balance of sweetness and tequila.  I always get the Mahi Mahi fish tacos with usually one of their taco specials.  I love how you can mix and match the different tacos.  The tortilla they are served on is hard to describe.  It is more flaky and light than your average flour tortilla.  The ingredients in the tacos are very fresh and flavorful.  Lastly, I am always craving the jalapeño mash potatoes, because they are THE best mash potatoes I have ever had.  However, they are only served as a seasonal side.  So I am disappointed when they are not an option and have to get my second favorite of the slaw.  This is a must try restaurant if you are in NODA!"}
{"text":"Cabo Fish taco is one of those places that is perfect for a variety of occasions: parents coming to town, a casual date, or lunch colleagues. The vibe is definitely casual and hip with a lot of open seating and a great little patio outside. As others have stated, parking can be a pain in the butt, but if you drive around the corner there is ample street parking along side roads within a short distance. Hope my fellow NC natives have been working on the elusive skill of  parallel parking because you will need it here.   Ordered the honey soy glazed salmon tacos which were well cooked and on point. I could do without the sauce they put on it some sort of creama it just makes the flavors too complex and not in a good way. The avocado pasta salad was good, but definitely could have used more salt.    Will definitely come back to try some other things on the menu. As others said, it can get kind of loud. Recently visited during lunch on a weekday and the place was maybe at 40% capacity and a bit loud, so keep that in mind if you're looking for something more intimate."}
{"text":"As a first timer, I can honestly say that my expectations were blown away by this place. I could seriously eat here every day for the rest of my life and be totally okay with it. I love Mexican and I love fish, so I am predisposed to like any place that combines the two.  While visiting friends, they drove us around different neighborhoods and pointed out Cabo Fish Tacos while we were in NoDa. While they were at work the next day, I went back right as they opened at 11am for an early lunch. The service was amazing (granted they weren't exactly swamped at the time), and kept the water and chips and salsa coming all meal long. It didn't take very long to get our orders.  My boyfriend got the grilled mahi mahi and the steak special taco and I got a grilled mahi mahi and a BBQ mahi mahi. First: the shell. Awesome, a little puffy, not overly greasy, although a little flimsy on the BBQ taco. Second: The fish. I can't think of any place I've ever been where I've gotten that much fish (and great quality fish at that) in a fish taco. At first I didn't think two would fill me up, but they definitely do! I am not a huge BBQ person, so I preferred the grilled, but they were both excellent. I got the rice and beans as a side, and they were a little spicy compared to what I'm used to and whatever spice they used kind of stuck in my teeth, so that was the only \"miss\" of the meal for me.   I'm bummed I don't live in Charlotte because this would definitely be a regular place of mine. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in town!  Hopefully I'll get to try some of their awesome looking margaritas next time too!"}
{"text":"Great food! Very popular resturaunt with a long wait, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. The restaurant was crowded on a Good Friday but we only had to wait about 15 minutes. The service was attentive but not overbearing. The food was served quickly. The portions were generous. The Epic Tuna burrito was tasty and the Salmon taco Salad was delicious. a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"The most variety you will find here is in the clientele.  Menu has a narrow range of items that are sure to fit anyone with a palette for fish. Service was great and staff very friendly. You will see any and every kind of person in this artsy district.  Do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"Have to try the BBQ Mahi tacos! So good, love this place! Only problem is that it's extremely loud inside. The music playing is way too loud which causes everyone to talk loud and you can't hear anything inside that place. We always request a seat outside because of the noise inside."}
{"text":"This place is so good!    They don't just have fish tacos; they have all kinds of tacos and all are great.   Parking can be a pain in NoDa, but if you drive around a little, you can often find something.   The one downside to this place is that there is no reservations.   :(   So you will have to wait.   But they will take down your number and you can check the status of your wait while you enjoy some drinks at a neighboring bar.    The other downside is that it can get loud inside.   Therefore if it is nice outside, I recommend sitting on the patio where it is a little less loud.   Even with the down \"downsides\" though, it is definitely worth going to!"}
{"text":"Fresh. Vibrant. Nodaish. Trustworthy.   You can't ask for a better taco menu. You can't go wrong with any item on the menu actually! My food came displayed how I imagine the OG Thanksgiving dinner looked, in a cornucopia - almost too pretty to eat. Don't worry, I ate it and it was scrumptious.   Cabo is unique, not only are the wall art installations funky, but the menus have something for everyone. Trust me when I say everyone! You can feel comfortable taking anyone here and knowing they will find something they love.   Be sure you get your tofu grilled not blacked. Blackened ia good, but grilled has the taste of summer and it sits well with the fresh veggies and cilantro rice.   Get crazy here Nd try something outside of your norm. It won't let you down!"}
{"text":"I'm not normally one to go out of my way to share a negative review, but I feel like it's warranted in this instance. First, I'll say that the food was tasty and the server was as attentive as she most likely could have been given how busy the restaurant was.   My grievance is with how much I was charged: I ordered a burrito, with no wrap and instead on a bed of mixed greens, and no rice substituting extra vegetables. On my bill was a $2 surcharge for a \"side salad\"  (the bed of lettuce equalled maybe half-a-cup of shredded lettuce ... definitely not a side salad) and a $2.25 surcharge for \"extra vegetables.\"   Now, I'm not unreasonable and assumed I'd be charged something for the substitutions but feel like the server should have discussed the charges with me beforehand since they were so outlandish. I wound up paying $17.50 (before tip) for what essentially was a deconstructed burrito minus the rice and wrap."}
{"text":"Great fresh food! I had the salmon and batter fried cad tacos, both where great. The area is crowded and parking is poor but the atmosphere and food are great."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but I've heard so many great things about Cabo Fish Taco and I had to check it out. Parking was hard to find, but it was worth it. The restaurant was great, food came quickly and was absolutely delicious. I ordered some sort of steak taco with various veggie toppings, and I was full for hours. Couldn't even finish my meal I was so stuffed. Waiter was very friendly. Lighting was a little dim, but it added to the atmosphere and gave the restaurant a nice feel. Great experience."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting Charlotte from a recommendation I got at another restaurant. So glad I came! Service was great, it was my waitress' first night on the job and she did wonderful!  I tried the bbq mahi taco and a blackened mahi taco. The Bbq mahi was better by far, not sweet, but a little tangy, it was amazing. After the bbq mahi my blackened mahi taco seemed a little plain jane. Also the flour tortillas were so unique , they were fluffy and reminded me slightly of Indian fry bread. They were so good and made it much easier to hold/eat the hearty tacos!  I also tried a skimny margarita in the rocks, which was yummy and paired great with the tacos.   I would definitely go back, I was told after I ordered that the calamari tacos are delicious as well, so that's what I want to try next!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place in Charlotte. Love the margaritas and the appetizer roll with the crab meat (can't remember the name). BBQ mahi, ahi tuna, and the serrano chicken are some of my go-to tacos. If it's in season get the jalapeno mashed potatos (can they please start having this year-round!?!?). Usually a bit of a wait but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. It's worth the wait! The salmon tacos, salmon salad, mani mahi tacos are all so yummy. Love the slaw. And the ambiance of the place. Great patio in the summer and awesome drinks!"}
{"text":"I was here Saturday and I had the Best Fish tacos, I must say I was impressed, very light and healthy, the fish was cooked just right and was not over the top on toppings."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious. A little pricey for what you get. They need a bigger place because you wait a long time to get in"}
{"text":"Ok, first let me start by saying the tacos were great. We went on a Saturday and were seated pretty quickly. We liked our waitress. What I did not like is we ordered a drink and then an hour later when the table across from us  sat and was eating in like 5 minutes I was wondering what was going on. Finally our waitress came and told us the kitchen pulled our order at the end instead of the beginning. So we waited and hour and 20 mintes to eat, bought more drinks because we were sitting there with a guest. So its was and additonal 40.00 in drinks and the waitness shoudl have compted us the second round of drinks. I really enjoyed the food but the fact that 6 tacos cost me about 100.00 becuase of the 5 drinks is crazy. It took us over 2 hours to eat and we only ate for about 15.00 miniutes.  I really wish the service had been better because it ruined the whole thing for me. Oh I had the salmon tacos and they were very tasty. I just hate having a whole night ruined by bad service...and I had to pay 100.00 for it hummm"}
{"text":"This is a frequent stop for my fiancé and I. Their food is always amazing, and the service is always outstanding. There is not one negative thing to say about this place! The carne asada tacos are a staple, as are the BBQ mahi! I have never had a bad meal from Cabo. I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a unique twist on Mexican cuisine. I will be coming back for years to come."}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco is one of those places that people who don't frequent the NoDa area tend to flock to.   Being right in the middle of NoDa, Cabo Fish Taco tries to embrace the NoDa vibes with some quirky artwork, but just misses the mark a bit.  My stomach has never agreed with Cabo based on the three times I've eaten tacos there (not a great sign). I also just can't get over the fact that every time I've gone, THE CHIPS HAVE BEEN STALE. This is mind-boggling to me, since they serve so many chips every day. I will admit, the spicy avocado salad is a REALLY solid pasta salad, so definitely snag that as a side if you're dining there!"}
{"text":"The signature tacos are okay, we tried the mahi mahi and white fish~We love the specialty tacos, the salmon and the tuna tacos are great!The environment is nice with good service."}
{"text":"THE BEST FISH TACOS I'VE EVER HAD!   So last Saturday I tried this place for the first time after hearing all these great things about it from friends, and it definitely lived up to my expectations. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!   I've had the lemon grilled tuna and grilled salmon tacos, they were both great, but the salmon one was to die for! The cilantro white sauce really perfects the dish! You also get a side with the order as well; I chose fruit cup to be a little on the healthy side. I thought 2 tacos wasn't going to be enough for me because I have such a big appetite, but it was very filling. Good portion size!   This is definitely a place to check out. I want to go there again very very soon!"}
{"text":"Saw this place was on diners, drive-ins, and dives and did not disappoint.  Had shrimp tacos and BBQ mahi tacos both excelllent."}
{"text":"Cabo \"was\" one of my favorite places in Charlotte. It was my favorite to-go tacos. Clean, good service, and great food. HOWEVER, since they changed their menu few months ago and increased the prices, the quality been going down hill. Chips are ALWAYS cold, food comes cold, and the quality of the dishes are way way way off. Indeed, the food doesn't even taste the same.  I honestly not sure what happened to them, but I hope they get it together again. Those 3 stars for what they used to be, now? I wouldn't even give them 1 star."}
{"text":"This noda staple has a lot of great features and plenty to offer in terms of variety, atmosphere, affordability, etc.  However, I think it may be getting a little played out and my most recent visit was not as impressive as times past.  On a side note, they have this new system where they text you when your table is ready so I thought that was pretty cool...  So, we had a party of 6 this past Friday and for the most part we were seated quickly, treated well and the waitress was very attentive.  I think their service is pretty good overall.  They start you off with a corn salsa in a dish that is so microscopic I could hardly fit my chip in there.  Trying to scoop straight up corn onto a corn chip is just annoying in my opinion.  If it was salsa, WITH corn, then maybe I could get on board but more corn ends up on the table than on your chip or in your mouth.  We ended up ordering some queso and that came out in the same itty bitty dish...but the queso was good.  I don't need to rehash all of the food, the fish tacos, the wraps/burritos, etc...I think everyone knows what they have at this point.  Everything we ordered was \"good.\"  We ordered a couple specials for the night, mahi-mahi fish tacos, grilled shrimp tacos, etc.  Everything seemed fairly fresh but I will say that most of our dishes came out cold/lukewarm.  I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos and they were just a little dry.  It was like eating a piece of lukewarm shrimp wrapped in a piece of bread.  The other ingredients were barely there so it didn't add anything to the overall flavor of the taco.  The refried beans were a bit cold as well.  I know they are super busy so I can't expect perfection but I just think the quality of this place has decreased slightly since my first visit a couple years ago.  It is still an exciting, vibrant place to be and I still felt like I was cool because I was in noda with all the trendy, cool people...but I think the lack of competition in this area is what keeps this restaurant truly hopping.  It is unique but if you put up a couple more restaurants on N. Davidson I don't think Cabo would maintain their hype.  That's just my opinion."}
{"text":"There's nothing to critique. They've figured it out. The causal atmosphere, the show stopping drinks, and the menu... it's delicious! The bonus- it is located in NoDa. Cabo Fish Taco is winning all around. No wonder they're featured on tv shows and in magazines. The honey glazed salmon taco is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place ever. I'm originally from Blacksburg which is where the only other Cabo is located, and I'm not going to say that Cabo was the sole reason we picked the NoDa neighborhood to relocate to, but it was definitely a factor.  This place holds a special place in my heart, and my tummy. My go to order (I literally do not stray from this, ever): Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos with the Guacamole Pasta Salad."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Cold beer. Delicious crab dip (appetizer).   The rest can go. I wasn't really a fan. There are 900+ other reviews so I will keep mine short.   I came here with two other girlfriends and loved the vibe. We ordered not 1, but 2 crab dip appetizers- sooooo good. I ordered the lemon garlic shrimp tacos... I should've just ordered a 3rd crab dip. I also ordered the avocado salad for my side- not good at all. You know when people hype up a place and you go and it's not good... yeah that was exactly my emotions as I drove home irritated.  Service was so-so. I was not impressed at all after hearing rave reviews over the past few years."}
{"text":"This place used to be a go-to place in Noda. I'm not sure if they've changed management or ownership or if they've stopped caring. Their chips are always stale, and their corn salsa is less of a salsa and more of side of corn.  Their tacos used to be really good and now you'll be unimpressed. I hope they read this review bc I used to enjoy the vibe and food at this place and their standards have dropped."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town! Bartender Cobra rocks! She is attentive and fun. Had a great meal and a great experience! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Cabo Fish Taco, not sure where to start.  It has been probably 10 years since my last visit and I remember thinking it was just ok, nothing great. And, after returning this year, I can clearly say I am not missing out on anything. Cabo Fish Taco is just okay...just don't get what all the hype is about. We arrived shortly after 7 on a Monday night and did not have a wait, which was great. We were seated in the new addition of the restaurant (which may not be so new, but since the last time I was there). It is definitely a great addition to the location, very open with a full bar and multiple tables. Monday nights they offer a Margaritaville Margarita for $5.00 so we started with those and were brought chips and salsa, which is corn and tomatoes.  This is the one thing I remember people love about Cabo, not me. It is okay, but no flavor. Needs a little salt. And the chips, they are chips. Not hot, don't seem fresh and need salt.  I ordered the Chicken Quesadillas with a side a refried beans. The quesadillas were good, grilled perfectly with melted cheese, chicken and peppers and onions. The peppers and onions definitely could have been cooked more. As for the beans, blah. Wouldn't bother with those again. My friend ordered the Tavarua Tacos and was not impressed. He also ordered the jalepeno mashed potatoes which sounded really good but said they were nothing great.  So, I remember why I hadn't rushed back and don't anticipate going back anytime soon. However, I thought our server was very sweet and definitely thought her service and the timing of drinks/food service deserved three stars."}
{"text":"I love tacos! That being said, this place was so so so good. I highly recommend the shrimp dip to start but you also get chips and a really yummy corn salsa! I had a lemon grilled shrimp taco and a blackened mahi mahi taco with the Baja rice as my side. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the tacos! They all sounded so good! Our waitress was super cool and kept the margs coming which were also great! Can't wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"The tai chili tofu tacos are AMAZING! I should've tried a different side. But overall great food and margaritas!"}
{"text":"cabo fish taco was good.  i ordered the cabo fish taco, but wish i had been a little more adventurous.  the salsa that they bring out was very watery and hard to get on the chips.  as other people have commented, there was corn all over our table.  the CFT was good but needed more spice.  adding hot sauce helped quite a bit.  the prices at cabo fish taco were extremely reasonable and the atmosphere was fun.  the local art hanging on the walls was interesting to check out - as CFT is located in NODA."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by a good friend of ours. We tried it for dinner tonight and it just wasn't for us. Im sure plenty of people would appreciate the strong margaritas and people who like flavorful salty food would love it. I probably woulda really liked it in my early 20s. The waitress was super nice and we had absolutely no issues with the service. The inside is loud but if you do outdoor seating, it's not so loud. It does take a while to be seated but they text you when your table is ready so you can go for a walk or something."}
{"text":"Best tuna taco I've ever had. The avocado pasta salad is really unbelievable as well. Hint, sit at The bar for immediate seating"}
{"text":"This place is highly overrated! Maybe I came on a bad night. My server was M.I.A most of the night.  The young lady who was seating people did more of his job. She kept bringing us refills and ended up bringing us our food because she noticed how slack he was. Also, the food was just OK."}
{"text":"Thanks to other yelp reviews,we knew to arrive early to score a seat at the bar (5:45 sat nt)   and we did! And not moments later the place was packed,like 1 hr 45 min  wait  packed.       Since we scored such golden seats we took our time ordering.  Red stripe for my friend,dos equis draft for me and queso dip to share.  I could have licked the bowl of queso clean it was so good. The free corn salsa was good too. Mild like alot of reviewers mentioned but its fresh made and FREE!   She ordered the tuna burrito and I got the tuvaroo(incorrect spelling) with jalapeno mash -  both were excellent. Prices are just right too. The honey wasabi was different and delightful :)    the bathroom(right behind our seats) was nicer than expected and matched the nice decor of the restaurant.  Oh and the host at the door was sooo nice,he made us feel right at home when we walked in.  reminded me of one of my fav  new orleans restaurants, Cabo fish taco is a gem!"}
{"text":"Today was my 1st time at CFT.  And I have to admit...it was really REALLY good!  I love the laid back atmosphere.  The waitress was the BEST!  I work in the service industry and I always expect amazing customer service everywhere I go, and she deserves 5 stars!  I hate coming to a new restaurant and the wait staff doesn't explain the menu/concept.  She was very very thorough and so personable.  Some wait staff can be a little too personable and it can get annoying.  But she was the perfect amount.  She explained the menu very well to someone like me who is very indecisive.  And our drinks and chips were never empty (and we had a table of 8).   I think some people may not like the salsa.  It's mainly corn, red onion, tomatoes, lemon juice, cilantro, and maybe some green peppers.  I loved it.  Nice and simple.  I had the tuna rancheros.  It was so good!  The tuna was cooked perfectly and the tomatoes were so juicy and sweet.  I had a bite of my friend's beer battered shrimp taco and it was amazing.  I regretted not getting it, but oh well, I'll just have to go back!  I will definitely be back...very soon!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and they load it with the meat!!! The tuna was seated perfectly. And the steak was great too! Wish I had more room to try more. The avocado pasta salad was a good side too"}
{"text":"I have been to Cabo many times but this time I went with something different. I got the diablo shrimp with pineapple. It was really good less spicy than expected but it had a great bbq sauce on it. The shrimp were over a delicious salad that was fresh with a balsamic dressing. The dressing was good but not really needed with the sauce of the shrimp. I would have never thought of this place to have light options but it was a great choice for a variety of options."}
{"text":"This place is one of the things I miss most about living in North Carolina. I will start out by saying that I am not a big fan of seafood, but I do enjoy a good fish taco. Their Bbq Mahi Tacos are my favorite item on the menu. I've ordered that dish quite a few times and it's never anything less than fantastic. The texture and flavor of the mahi is just perfect and they are very generous with the portion. The dish comes with two tacos, but so much falls out of each taco you almost need a third tortilla to make an extra taco with. I must also suggest the wasabi tuna burritos. There is just something about that wasabi sauce... and the large chunks of tuna, just....delish. The only things that I'd like to see added to the menu are corn tortillas. Flour tortillas are good, and theirs aren't bad, but when it comes to fish tacos I tend to prefer corn. The music volume also tends to be a little on the loud side. When you're already hard of hearing it makes conversation with the other people in your group a bit of a challenge. Other than that, wouldn't change a thing. It's truly a unique restaurant in a trendy setting in Charlotte's art district. When I head back to Charlotte this summer for a visit, this place is on my to-do list."}
{"text":"Have been here twice - only had tacos (figured they had to be good, hence their name) I've tried the beer battered white fish & the BBQ Mahi Mahi tacos - both were very good. (although the rice and beans are pretty dry, nothing to rave about) I love the homemade tortillas. Also - you can't go wrong with chips & queso (their salsa w/ corn in it is pretty tasty as well) Both times I came here on a Saturday for lunch & ended up sitting at the bar because the place was packed. The atmosphere is very hipster but nice, with very cool paintings adorning the walls. (LOVE the huge Samurai painting) If I want a good fish taco I'll come here. Not sure if I want / need to try anything else here, I'll stick to tacos."}
{"text":"As the name implies - mexican with a strong seafood lean.  BBQ Mahi tacos and a cold beer still one of my favorites after a number of years.   Helpful staff and reasonably quick food service.  I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"So so so awful! I really don't understand people that like this place. Their salsa is 99% FROZEN corn with a couple chunks of crappy, tasteless tomatoes. Stale, cold chips. Asked for another salsa because heard another table ordering the \"tomato salsa\" and they literally brought us jarred salsa-- like Pace or Tostitos out of a jug and it was ice cold. They didn't even try to dress it up. The tacos were okay-- the white cilantro sauce looks good but had no flavor. So bad, so so bad."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best tacos in Charlotte. I always get the salmon tacos. Delish!  The restaurant is the best location, and is jam packed no matter what time of the day !"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing. We wanted to get seconds it was so good! I got the steak tacos and then eat was perfectly seasoned and cooked just right. The spicy avocado pasta salad was to die for. I'm saving this place for future reference because this was a great place!!"}
{"text":"The tacos are really good.  The menu regulars and special tacos a like.  My favorites are the tuna tavarua and the honey soy salmon.  They have a corn based salsa with their chips that isn't my favorite.  The guacamole is way below the bar, especially for a taco place, one of the worst in the city.  The mexi-slaw is decent but I only get that side because the rest aren't very good either.  They make up for everything else with the tacos which is why everyone goes there.         The restaurant itself is pretty large and has a porch like outdoor seating area in the front.  They can open up the large clear walls on nice days too.  I would plan on putting your name in and  grabbing a drink in the neighborhood while you wait for your table.  There is almost always a long wait but I live so close I usually get takeout which is super easy.        ***  I live in the middle of NODA and have been everywhere in the neighborhood many times over the past years. These reviews are a culmination of lots of visits so it's more of a consistency rating than anything.  If you are going out in NODA I've got reviews up of all the places in the neighborhood if you're looking to compare.  ***"}
{"text":"Went with two of my girlfriends on a Wed. Night. Seated immediately. Restaurant had a nice feel to it.  I ordered a traditional beer battered fish taco and a Wahoo Fish taco. The latter was simply amazing. The traditional (at least what I consider traditional) was just okay. Perhaps I had super high expectations because, oh I don't know, their name includes the words \"Fish Taco\". The corn salsa was fresh and very tasty. The guacamole was just okay but my expectations weren't that of the beer battered fish tacos seeing as how it's not \"Cabo Guacamole Dip\".  This was my first visit so I asked our \"too cool for school\" waiter his recommendation. He smugly responded, \"I haven't had a bad taco in 4 years.\" Dude, I didn't ask how long you've been employed at the establishment, I asked what you recommended from the establishment.   All in all, food was good, nice environment, waiter was a douche."}
{"text":"Sometimes the wait is long and parking stinks, but it's worth it! I was skeptical by the corn-salsa but it was good! I had swordfish tacos that were on special and they were amazing. The side of past salad I chose was spicy and delicious!"}
{"text":"When Mrs. K. says that she wants fish tacos, I steered us to Cabo in NoDa to meet that craving. On a Saturday afternoon, a little busy and maybe a little rowdy but they were able to bring us to a table and a very pleasant waiter took our orders.  With not much on the mostly bare walls to break up the sound, it is definitely a little loud in here. A few televisions tuned to sports and news channels but the noise is all people.  Food arrived swiftly and they have an excellent corn salsa to go with their chips. Not exactly easy to scoop and easy but we made do until the guacamole arrived. A nice portion with a good spicy tang to it, yum.  Then the fish tacos. Nice big chunks of fish here and a sauce that had a little zing to it. Delicious and easy to eat though you'll want to fork a few pieces of that fish first to make room. For sides, I would really recommend the avocado pasta salad. Amazing.  Excellent service, great food and reasonable prices. Easy to rate Cabo at Five Stars."}
{"text":"Went to Cabo last night for a celebratory meal with my boo... it did not disappoint. I knew the evening would be great would we pulled up and the parking spot closest to the door was open. I was able to do a quick, illegal U-turn and whip my RAV 4 right into the parallel spot LIKE A BOSS.  Anyway, we were greeted by the hostesses and sat in a quaint, two person table along the left wall. Our server was fantastic - she gave us the right amount of time to decide on our margar selections (an important choice, for sure) and had our drinks out to us in a jiffy. We both ordered burritos - I got the carne asada burrito with a side of fruit. They accidentally brought me the wrong side, but quickly corrected it and let me have both sides! My burrito was delicious - steak was tender and perfectly spicy for me. My side of fruit was excellent.   It got more crowded as the night went on, but the atmosphere was still good for a chat with my main squeeze.  I highly recommend Cabo Fish Taco."}
{"text":"The service was quick and the server knew the menu so was able to give a few great recommendations.  Drinks came out immediately and the food soon after.  I had the perfect wave margarita and was to par. The atmosphere is very casual and laid back, there is noise but not overwhelming. But most important is the food was amazing. Best taco every.  I had the grilled lemon shrimp and the tavarua fish taco.  AMAZING.  Happy. And full."}
{"text":"Great spot for tasty food and people watching. Gets loud and crowded but that's part of the fun. Every fish taco option is excellent and their sides are great too. Good margarita selection for the tequila fan and fun artistic decor. You have to go at least once! Just don't be in a rush if it's a weekend night."}
{"text":"A little loud but what great food. Try the bbq mahi!! We had a group of 7 and I tried just about everything.  All awesome. Nice beer selection too"}
{"text":"I love seafood and Mexican food...naturally, Cabo Fish Taco was a delightful treat last night! This may have been my first time there but it definitely won't be my last. I wasn't surprised to find that Cabo was packed around 7:45p last night. They won't seat you unless your entire party is there so make sure to be on time if you are meeting someone.   We were seated right away and given this amazing corn salsa to start. I wasn't a fan of the chips, they were a little stale for my taste, but the corn salsa was crisp and refreshing. Definitely a step up from the tomato salsa you get at chain restaurants. I took V's recommendation and ordered the epic tuna burrito rare with a side of avocado pasta salad. I was tempted to order the beer battered salmon tacos but I'll save that for another Thursday. The bf got a beer battered shrimp taco and a chicken taco. I didn't mind the wait, we had corn salsa to keep us company.   Food came out, those tacos looked huge! I seriously have not seen tacos that stuffed, I definitely will be returning for those tacos now. The shrimp was tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside, as it should be. The epic tuna burrito is rightfully named with generous chunks of fresh tuna. I love sushi so I enjoyed the rare tuna. For all of you who don't normally eat seafood, its not fishy at all. The shrimp and fish were seasoned so well. That pasta salad, yum, soooo creamy. I am going to have to opt for this option for every meal at Cabo.   We are for sure coming back. I'll have to try a margarita next time. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great place in Noda! I loved how they texted you when your table was ready so you could walk around into the shops. The waitstaff was great and the tacos were to die for! Our waitress thanked us for being awesome, not something you hear at most places."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and decided to stop by after seeing it featured on DDD and boy was the food delicious.  I went during lunch hr and the place was pretty busy but the service was great. Parking is a b**ch but the neighborhood is cool and eclectic. I tried the salmon tacos which was topped with with pimento cheese...i know it sounds weird but it was good. The spicy avocado pasta salad was amazing. If I'm ever in the area again I'll go back."}
{"text":"The food is great! Service fast and efficient- Hearty portion of Food! One of the best fish taco places I've been to.    Highly Recommend the Honey Soy glazed Salmon   Ryan was a great server he had awesome menu knowledge!"}
{"text":"All i can say wow!!  Best taco ever had. Beautifull Ambience, nice music. Servers are very attentive. Loved it"}
{"text":"I ate at CFT for the first time this week with some coworkers. Delish!! I had the chicken quesadilla, and asked for light cheese...it was perfect. Looking forward to going back soon!!"}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed Cabo?   If you like seafood, tacos, salsa, and don't mind waiting for it, you need to at least try it! I've been here a few times for dinner, and the wait is always tremendous. You put your name in with the cool, laid-back hostesses that are always working, and you can walk around NoDa for the remainder of your time.   Once you do get in the door, they greet you with some corn salsa and chips. When the chips are hot, you're in business! It's delicious and a great appetizer for your amazing meal to come.  I've been here a few times, and I've never strayed away from the tacos. I get the two taco plate, and normally like to mix-and-match. The fish is great, battered or grilled, as are the shrimp tacos, battered. I do think my favorite is the battered shrimp tacos, but it really depends on the mood.  It's a very noisy environment, especially at dinner. I've come during lunch and it's still just a loud place to be. Not really a complaint, but I wouldn't call Cabo a date-spot."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. We put our name down on the wait list, they gave us a call at 2:44pm to let us know our table was ready, we call them at 2:50pm to tell them we are on our way, we show up at 2:56pm and the rude hostess tells us they gave our table away because it had been more than 18 minutes. We showed her the time stamped call on our iPhone and she still refused to seat us. As a new resident of Charlotte, I will not be going here ever again."}
{"text":"I had the blackened mahi mahi taco which was delicious. It was spicy but still flavorful. The salsa for the chips is fresh and similar to a pico de gallo. Charles was our server. He was attentive throughout our dining experience and very pleasant."}
{"text":"What started out to be a great day ended in my going back to bed at 3:30PM.   After having such a wonderful experience at Shine with Mark, I decided to head over to NODA to check it out and to try something new, Cabo Fish Taco  So the place was packed, as expected from what I've read per previous reviews. I asked if there was a place at the bar since I was solo.   Headed to the bar and was ignored. Finally the grumpy and \"I'm too busy checking my iPhone\" bartender dude came over. He offered me a drink menu and I asked for the full food menu as well. He asked if I wanted chips and \"salsa\" .  As  I was looking over the drink menu, nothing really stood out, so I had the Souza something or other.. blah... boring, bland... stupid... why bother to order kind of drink - as it turned out. And not to mention it was served by a not so friendly bartender.   The chips were fine, but the corn-tomato salsa was DRY... it looks like they must pre-serve the bowls and let them sit until they are grabbed to be distributed. Salsa should be fresh, not dry.   Ok, then another person, brought over my lunch, I had ordered the lemon grilled shrimp taco with a steak taco and a side of re-fried beans as I, personally, dislike black beans. Strange I know, but I despise black beans.   The tortillas were warm, but the proteins cold. The cheddar cheese used on the steak tacos didn't even warm (and why would you put cheddar cheese on a steak taco?) The proteins were of good quality, but SERIOUSLY lacked any kind of flavor. I agree with Tanya R. -- white sauce, what white sauce? I asked if they had any other salsa's -- the dude looked at me like I was crazy. I said, you know hot sauces. He brought over Tapatio and Chula... ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? I said, \"No like salsa verde or rojo? Something else made in-house\" still he stood there blank and annoyed. I said something made in house... he went on to saying something with wasabe... What? WTH in a mex joint... I said forget it, please just bring out some more white sauce (which he charged me for). I put tapatio in in to help enhance it and to add heat.   The food was a big let down. The proteins were of good quality, lacked serious seasoning and were served cold. The re-fried beans were really weird tasting... sour almost, so I quit eating them in case there were bad.   I asked the to busy bartender after he finished checking his iPhone if the owners were from So Cal... he said I don't know... I just started here. REALLY you don't know shit about the restaurant you work in... WOW  And what put my experience over the top was they allow their wait staff to wear daisy dukes... one girl bent over and you could see up to a land you didn't want to observe...  The staff all seemed overwhelmed and too busy to care. Argh I hate grumpy staff. The \"good\" thing out of my experience there was this nice patron sitting next to me at the bar who complemented my shirt...   I doubt I'd ever return. I can't believe this next part is even going to come out of my mouth, but I so wish a Rubio's would come to Charlotte, I would so welcome this chain and their taco Tuesday's... The places I avoided back home is what I'd rather eat here. Sad, shaking my head I even typed that, but at this point, I'd die for one of their fish tacos with white sauce and their salsa verde..."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in at Cabo Fish Taco on a recent visit to Charlotte, NC.  We split an order of the Blackened Mahi-Mahi tacos and the Beer Battered Shrimp tacos.  Both were very tasty; however, I preferred the Shrimp tacos out of the two.  We each were able to select from a choice of several sides which we did,  Our waitress Heather was very prompt and courteous and was very good about checking in with us.  Chris, the GM, came over to our table and once he found out we were from out of town / state, he sat down and began giving us recommendations on local eateries as well as brew pubs.  Chris was very cool!!  Definitely would go back, and definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places in Charlotte, best quesadillas and their tacos are amazing, I get the lemon grilled shrimp and the blackened mahi! The sides are also delicious, the avocado pasta salad is to die for and the seasonal mashed potatoes are fantastic! Don't take reservations so make sure you get there early. They are very fast but is always crowded."}
{"text":"100% my favorite spot in Charlotte.   The food is great, I've had so many of the menu items--and I've never complained about anything. My number one favorite is the Tav-a-Roo tacos, but again, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Mix and match the tacos to try different flavors, I also recommend the baja rice for a side.   They have great drink specials and a full margarita list to choose from. When you sit down, they'll serve you chips and corn salsa...you're going to want more!   The servers are always great, the atmosphere is fun and laid-back. Absolutely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Charlotte has to offer. Must order food item is the shrimp and crap dip. All of the fish tacos are delicious. I highly recommend the Azula Rita as well.   Service is usually quick and friendly. My only complaint is that it can be a long wait to get a table, but that's the price to pay for going to one of the most popular restaurants in the area. Also, you can't make reservations here, which is another side effect of the above."}
{"text":"If your like me youre very picky about where you go to eat fish, especially fish tacos. Cabo is my favorite spot. The location is great. Whenever we have friends visiting from out of town we take them to the NoDa area and typically eat at Cabo Fish Taco. Some people are reluctant to try fish tacos but everyone I have brought here has loved it. Not a single complaint. They offer some typical dishes but then also offer some exotic options as well. The sauces they use for the fish are amazing!"}
{"text":"Got a take out order which was prepared promptly.  I chose fried shrimp tacos which I were good but only had 4 smaller shrimp in them each.  I picked my side as pasta salad and while I typically love hot food this side was too spicy for me.   I might give it another shot for mahi mahi, I'd also like to see option of mixing up selections and buying more than just 2."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place really badly - as a DDD restaurant and the fact that there is almost always a line out the door, it seemed like a solid choice.   My boyfriend and I went at about 1:45p on a Saturday afternoon and it was only a 10min wait. Not too shabby!  We loved the lemon grilled tuna tacos, original margarita, and queso that we split. The queso almost tasted like a beer cheese, just had a more savory flavor than I'm used to I guess. The margarita was really interesting, you'd get the typical citrus/sour mix flavors at first then it had a really sweet after taste - I'm pretty sure I couldn't drink more than two without getting a massive hangover. And the tacos were out of this world - definitely the star of the show - and there were a handful of other types we want to try in the future that I'm confident are equally as good.   My only qualms are: (1) the chips and salsa they serve the table are a unique twist. Instead of making a standard tomato based salsa they serve the tortillas with a corn salsa. This is just a personal preference, but I don't want corn salsa (with close to nothing else but corn in it) with corn chips. Hence the queso move... (2) our server missed part of our order. Granted it was loud, I mumble, and one order of tacos plus a side plus queso was enough to fill us up. But still, he wrote down the first and third things I ordered. Confused on what happened there in the middle.   BUT, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious! Waitstaff was attentive and really cared that we liked our meals. Highly recommend the lemon grilled shrimp tacos! Yum!"}
{"text":"First time going to Cabos and I'm sure that I will return ASAP... I ordered Asadas with black beans and rice... they give you plenty to eat. The music is inviting and the staff takes exceptional care of you. If you have time to stop by I would suggest that you go!"}
{"text":"Am I missing something here??  I've been anxiously waiting to visit this place because I've heard so many positive things about it.  Heck, it's been featured on the food network!  So I finally went today.  Got there around 6:30 pm on a Friday evening and the tables were filling up quickly.  Cute decor, island music and nice youthful ambience.  I was feeling good...but not for long.   Chips and pico were served. Took a quick glance at the menu and knew what I wanted.  Fish tacos!  What else?  The place bears the name so it must be their specialty, right?  Wrong!!  I ordered the blackened mahi fish tacos.  ($10.50 for 2 tacos +1 side).  They were wrong in all senses of the word.  Where do I even begin...  Ok, so the plate looked nice but the fish was dry and warm (I like my food hot unless its supposed to be cold).  It had absolutely no flavor.  Blackened is supposed to be very flavorful people!  The fish chunks tasted like stale, warm, low-sodium canned tuna with a hint of, I don't know, garlic powder maybe??  It had a smear of avocado, a few shreds of white cabbage, a few shreds of cheese and a drizzle of \"white cilantro sauce\" which was so scant that I couldn't even taste it.  It was decoration, I guess. For my 1 side I chose the refried beans.  Yuk!  Tastes like cheap canned beans.  I ordered a dos XX special lager on tap and it was flat and watered down.  Even the beer was a hot mess.  And here I am in shock!  I'm not quite sure what all the hype is about. This place was not very good at all.  And I don't plan on going again.  Ever!  If I want good fish tacos, I'll go to the pros... Authentic Mexican.  I'm done!  What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I catch myself more often than not trying the nightly taco specials to keep switching things up. Entrees are massive, BBQ mahi and tavarua tuna tacos are my recommendations to people who haven't been   Corn salsa and chips for the table are a nice switch up. Queso is good with a Smokey flavor to it   Be prepared to wait a little bit on weekends"}
{"text":"This was the first place I checked out in NoDa, and I left so disappointed. Ok, so their claim to fame is fish tacos so that's what I ordered -- the beer battered white fish tacos. The white cilantro sauce was gross; the beer batter overwhelmed the taste of the fish. The corn salsa and chips were stale. The waitress offered to replace the meal, but since the tacos were bad and I was famished, I decide to order something safe . . . like a salad. Ok NoDa, don't let me down again. I am off to find my NoDa dining gem . . .  assuming one exists."}
{"text":"Definitely an awesome choice!!!!!!!!!! by far one of my favorite restaurants in Noda. Everyone needs to experience Cabo Fish taco sometime."}
{"text":"Love the fish tacos and great Noda atmosphere."}
{"text":"Okay folks, this is it. My final verdict, the end all be all of my Cabo reviews. I've had more than enough visits to add them up and divide them by pi. Cabo's perimeters were empty and the streets of Noda were barren. No gallery crawl, so lunch was to be served unadulterated and uninterrupted.   It all started on a sunny Sunday afternoon with amazing weather and a $2 can of Modelo. The service was friendly, the patio was ideal, and the food came out hot and fast.   Chips are no longer cold and instead of the regular fried White fish tacos, I decided to switch it up and opted for the special Tav-ah-roo tacos. The Tuna still wasn't anything special, but the wasabi sauce was pretty fabulous. Blackened tuna tacos were also so/so, along with the sides.   Cabo still hasn't made the upper echelon as far as my personal favorites, but still a very cool spot with decent food and a nice break from the norm."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is excellent! Quick wait staff who are friendly and the food is to die for. My husband and I ordered the queso as an appetizer and the tacos for entrees. The queso is out of this world! Smoky, creamy, and they serve it in an overflowing bowl - my kind of place!   I had the carne asada tacos with rice and beans. So flavorful and definitely not your average taco. What surprised me most was how good the tortillas were! They were double wrapped with a bit of cheese and freshly made. So yummy.   I also tried the Slim and Jalaritas - so good! The right balance between sweet and sour. I highly recommend this place - it's great for a light lunch or even before a night out - may be my new favorite Charlotte spot!"}
{"text":"I think Cabo is a great place to eat. If you are in the Noda area for a music venue, then please stop in at Cabo beforehand. They have great food and great Margerita's. They have a wide selection of Mexican food. The atmosphere is pretty hip, the food good. Its a bit crowded, but generally they move people through pretty fast. I usually get the Guacamole too!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, stopped on our way to the airport. Truly a gem in a great area"}
{"text":"Cabo I really wanted to like you... I have given you a few tries before writing this review.  You do have a few things going for you. 1. Great location 2. Interesting Tex-Mex decor  3. A really nice outdoor seating area  Let's start with the staff, the bartender gave me the wrong change ( not just keeping a buck or two for a tip- maybe it was a mistake) and fought with me for about 5 minutes before I had to show him the price of my drink in the menu. I think my waitress hated me or just hated life.  The salsa is corn based- okay, I can get that you want to be different, but the salsa is bland and simply tastes like canned corn. Our chips were stale. The queso would have been okay, but it was cold, which made it form into solid cheese- not very good on stale chips.  I decided to get fish tacos- I figured with a place called ' fish taco' I couldn't go wrong. My shrimp tacos were really boring. It seemed like the kitchen ran out of ingredients  I think they were beer battered, to be honest I couldn't really tell. My whole tables meals came out at different times and our sides to our meals were incorrect.  I would have told my waitress that our food was incorrect, but I couldn't find her for the rest of the night, until our checks came.... $12.00 for two bland and skimpy tacos. No thank you!  I really don't like to give bad reviews, but I can't find a reason to return to Cabo Fish Taco."}
{"text":"Great burritos, god awful service.  It seems like they do some kind of misguided communal attempt at serving here, and then none of the servers communicate with each other so we ended up with multiples of some things and none of others.  Worst of all the servers seemed annoyed with US when we corrected them.    Listen guys, theres a reason that 99% of restaurants have one waiter per table, BECAUSE IT WORKS.  On the brightside, the burrito I had was pretty damn good, so was my girlfriends, though I dont remember which ones they were, the fact that 2 different ones were good leads me to believe they have their burrito game on lock.    Unfortunately I dont think I can suffer through the awful service again, but if it ever gets fixed, I'll definetly go back more often, shame really."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere.  I wish they would bring back the Jalepeno mashed potatoes :)  Can be VERY crowded"}
{"text":"Barely waited for a table at about 2pm on a Friday. The chips and corn salsa were great, and the salsa definitely has a kick to it. I chose the bbq mahi and lemon grilled shrimp tacos, and both were great. A little spicy, but nothing that a little alcohol can't help. On Friday's, they have a \"bartender's choice\", which happened to be a peach margarita--pretty strong and very good. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, it is consistently great. No wait at 6:00, had a BBQ something taco and a Wahoo taco, with the jalapeno cheese mashers. Food was excellent yet again. Highly recommend it. There is a donkey on the ceiling trim in the corner or the men's bathroom.. random I know but just saying."}
{"text":"Omg just go!!!!! This place is amazing! My husband and I have been to several Triple D's but this one tastes the cake! We have friends that have been to 35 Triple D's (Diners, Drive Ins and Dives) and this is their fave and I know why! We started well I started with an Azure Margarita \"Blue\" and it's the best Rita I have ever had! So smooth that I ordered a second one but this time pomegranate. They bring chips and a corn salsa to the table which is really good and light! We both ordered the 2 taco combo plate and they let you mix and match. My husband ordered shrimp and the lemon tuna and I got the steak and white fish. We both agreed that the white fish was the best. It was beer battered with like a tempura batter. Omg it was amazing! The shrimp had the same type batter! The steak was just ok..a bit tough. The tuna was fresh and flavorful!!! It was just good food! The taco shells are fried but soft not crunchy! This place is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"very loud place.  I had some sort of burrito that had ... wasabi in it... It tasted pretty bad."}
{"text":"You literally can't go wrong with anything in this place. Portions are huge by the way. The wait is always worth it. Beer is local and fairly priced. They could definitely charge more for the food & they don't - it's good food, a good time, lots of energy, and the best items. Overall win."}
{"text":"I'd heard friends talk about Cabo Fish Taco. I decided to try it. Really warm welcome and great service. It's a nice casual place but the service is really fantastic. I had a delicious Margarita and then a really filling burrito. Lots of choices and fun place to have dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Ahi Tuna Burrito, had some of the best flavor. Very fresh!  Wish it had come with something on the side, but overall definitely a redo."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Noda! My boyfriend refers to the corn salsa as \"crack\". I normally get the tavaru tacos or honey soy glazed salmon tacos. Why 4 stars and not 5? I've never had a good margarita there. I've tried 4 so far and it's a disappointment every time. Still an amazing place to eat and hang out at!"}
{"text":"Got the tuna salad for dinner Sunday night.  Asked for it to be cooked medium, came out well done. Was completely delicious, but I have been very VERY sick to my stomach since then (two days now). Was heartbroken to throw away my leftovers, but didn't want to risk exacerbating my situation. Most likely going to avoid Cabo from now on, and I'm hoping that I feel better soon. :("}
{"text":"Love me some Cabo!  There are a ton of tacos to choose from and every one I've ever had has been delish. Generally my wife and I get two different ones and share. Today's visit brought us beer battered Tilapia and BBQ Mahi. Most of the tacos come with minced cabbage, tomato, guacamole, cheese, and some yummy, creamy sauce drizzled on. They start you with some corn, tomato and pepper salsa and chips which is not too spicy but is always fresh tasting. Today we augmented with some queso that was hot, cheesy and tasty with a peppery finish.  The atmosphere is funky like most NoDa places and we've always found the service to be fast and friendly. No pretentious hipster vibe here as everyone seems to be deemed cool enough to be treated well by the staff. Always a mix of clientele from the tattooed and pierced to the khaki'd and buttoned down. Nice beer specials too and it was all I could do to lay off the $2 drafts before heading back to cubeville this afternoon!"}
{"text":"I saw Cabo Fish Taco on DDD about a week ago, and just had to check it out. Very busy, short wait. They said 10-15 min., but it was more like 5 min. I had the lemon shrimp tacos, they were wonderful. Oh, we also had the shrimp and crab dip & that is a must have! Prices are ok for the amount of food."}
{"text":"I quickly became a fan of Cabo Fish Taco when I found out just how fresh their tacos were. This review doesn't need to be long because all I really need to tell you is go and try this food because you will simply see for yourself what I'm talking about.  But the real winner of this place is by far the lightly fried taco shells. I truly have never tasted anything like them before. They're not crunchy tacos and they're not soft tacos, they are something completely new. It's what keeps coming back for more each week.  And please do try their crab dip, the fried pitas it served with will also make you want more."}
{"text":"I know that two stars is pretty steep but I have to be honest. I cannot live this Cabo Fish lie anymore. My friends rave about the jalapeño mash potato side...the tacos...and the drinks. Besides the drinks, I'm not a fan. The salsa is more corn than anything else. I want salsa. I want options. I can't get any options here. The guacamole is one scoop for almost 10 dollars. That hurts my soul.  Why the hell can't I get a regular taco option? Why does it have to be over the top?  I understand my opinion is not the most promising for Cabo Fish Taco. My friends love it. I have tried more than several occasions to find common ground with these tacos but my heart isn't interested nor my taste buds and my stomach isn't delighted over them either. I'm sorry. If you're searching for anything other than your wonderful authentic taco, this place is what your dreams are made of. That said, if you crave tacos from the streets of Morelia...keep searching, fellow taco lover.  But the environment can be fun with friends and I haven't found a need to complain about the drinks.  Truth be told, I will probably return to Cabo Fish taco because my friends don't know the lie I am living.   So I'll see you around and order a drink with an extra shot of tequila."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Queso was outstanding. High grade tuna on the tacos. Tons of spice, tons of flavor! Lives up to reviews!"}
