{"text":"I went there for lunch a week after their opening and thought the food was amazing. You get 6 pierogis and can do half orders if you want to try a few different ones. I got the deep fried Reuben and the pulled pork and they were both really amazing. The only downfall to the place is that it's going to cost $14-16 for 6 pierogis but you'll be full enough when you leave."}
{"text":"Looked forward to trying this, but closed. Door unlocked and when we walked in, people around bar and told they were closed."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. We were initially ready to excuse the staff for the poor service because it seemed like they were understaffed. However, we were given drinks we didn't order and when I questioned the waitress, she told me we were only charged for one not two and didn't apologize. We shouldn't have been charged for anything we didn't receive. To be honest, we should have been compensated for the terrible, incompetent service. When our dinner arrived, the order was wrong, we were missing salads, and were told that we were wrong in what we ordered. Overall, bad experience.   As a side note, it's really overpriced for what you receive. $16 for 6 pierogies is a bit much."}
{"text":"Pierogi's were very good. I had the pulled pork Pierogi. Hard to justify the price for the quantity. I shouldn't walk out hungry for $16."}
{"text":"Just opened a couple of weeks ago. Sat at the bar and enjoyed a plate of traditional boiled cheese and potato pierogi. Took me back, they were just as my family made them. Good service from Sheila. It's not easy to find real Polish food in most cities. It's definitely a go-back place next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Growing up with pierogi and being Polish, I was very excited to see that this place was opening. My boyfriend and I went to their \"soft opening\" which didn't seem as low key as I expected. There was no hostess and we were called by the ONLY waitress to go find a table. We were not greeted for probably 20 minutes. The menu looked great and definitely unique. I ordered the pulled pork pierogi because I can't say I've ever seen that offered before.   Well...1 hour and 45 min passed and we finally got our food. Why didn't I leave like I saw many other people do? I don't know. I was still excited. Pierogi were soggy and not authentic tasting to me at all. They apologized of course however they really weren't that busy by the time we were still waiting for our food.   I'm sure its lesson learned and they're probably much better and hopefully more prepared now. But, if you're looking for authentic pierogi/ Eastern European food, this wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Absolutely loved the decor. Our server Amber was great.  The pierogis were awesome. Everyone at our table (there were 6 of us) ordered a different type and we shared so that we could get a taste of 6 different ones. They have a few kinks to work out , but only opened a few months ago. One was that we tried to call ahead to make a reservation however their phones are not working. Hopefully they will get that problem fixed asap. The draft beer list is just written on a sheet of paper.  The menu is slightly misleading. it says you can order boiled or deep fried pierogis. We really didn't want either, we prefer them to be boiled then lightly browned in a frying pan instead of just boiled. We did not like the idea of deep fried either. However we were pleasantly surprised when we ordered the boiled and when they came out they were boiled but then lightly browned in the frying pan, just the way we like them!!  I think the menu should state that so you know what you will be served. We loved it there and will definitely go back again. I recommend this place to anyone that wants to try some unique pierogis!"}
{"text":"Was in from out of town and excited to try here.  We were told right away the computers were down and we would need cash, but no big deal. We came in at 4:30 on a Friday and were only the third table occupied in the place.  We ordered salads, yet ended up waiting 40 mins for food.  When we got it, the meat and Perogis on the salads were cold. The waitress was not able to found when e waited or after the food was delivered so we could share our concerns.  When we were asking for bills, they weren't able to split our checks and when we voiced our problems, we were told by the waitress she couldn't do anything since we ate the food.  The food was sitting in front of us barely touched.  The manager did come and give us a slight discount, but we were pretty bummed about the dinner and service we had been looking forward to.   On the bright side.. their ranch and side of fries were very tasty! They were all I ended up eating."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally got the chance.  The restaurant was pretty empty, I am assuming it was because there were no shows tonight.  For dinner I ended up picking the buffalo chicken pierogies, but this dish wasn't my first choice.  There was a great variety of pierogies, but when the waitress came over the first thing she did was to go through a list of what they were out of, which was a few beers, a few mixed drinks, and 4 of their pierogie types.  Of course the 3 pierogies I was already debating between were all on the list of what they were out of.  Honestly I was thinking 6 pierogies wasn't going to be enough, but they were filling.  I was able to squeeze some room for dessert.  The cherry cheesecake pierogies were delicious and my favorite part of the meal.  Overall the pace of the meal was very slow too for there only being 2 tables seated.  This is a great concept restaurant for Pittsburgh, but just didn't hit the mark for me.  I can see bringing out of town guests here though."}
{"text":"Great little place. Not sure about the other reviews, but the food is always good and the service is always great when I've been there. Pretty good prices for downtown in my opinion too. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place is new, according to my locals, and it has serious potential. Today is Black Friday and they were out of many items on the menu... bad news... good news is that my fam loves the chicken buffalo stuff'd. Asian ones were good. The boiled potato and sauerkraut had potential but were not hot, only like warm. Service was a bit slow.  I'd try again though... it will improve..."}
{"text":"Food didn't taste fresh or like what I would hope a $14 pierogi would be. Fried  was super dry and not what we expected.  Boiled ones weren't flavorful. We spent $55 with tip on 2 orders and 2 beers and I was pretty bummed. Servers were not friendly and arguing amongst themselves. Just was an odd night there maybe"}
{"text":"Loved!  Excellent pierogies. My husband's family is Polish and thought these were great. Delicious, tender. Great service. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a snack and a beer.  Fantastic staff and 14 pierogi options, plus desserts.  Our waitress let my wife and I solid an order, sow we both had 3 pierogis of our choice.    My Peach Pulled Pork pierogi was FANTASTIC.  The beer prices and selection are good, and the staff was GREAT!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more than I did, considering it's a pierogi place in the Burgh. I visited for dinner with a friend prior to seeing a show at the Benedum. Upon entering, it was slow and there were not many patrons. It was about 530, so it was hit or miss on how busy it would be. The server/hostess met me at the door and seated me in the back. It's not a terribly large place but has a nice sized bar.  I waited about 15 mins for my friend to arrive, and it was not until right before she arrived did they ask if i would like anything while I wait. It didn't take long for us to order food and have it placed, however it did take over 45 mins for the food to come out. The restaurant did become busier as time went on and filled up pretty quickly. Our orders were placed long before it got crowded, and it still took a considerably long time for the food to come out. A few other tables that arrived after us got their food prior to ours. When it did finally come, I was missing the pierogis on top of my salad, which they fixed quickly and without question. The food was good, but I wasn't overly impressed. I ordered a side salad with a plan pierogi and a half order of the Spring Roll pierogis (yes, you can order a half order of three rather than the usual six). They were tasty and filling, but the staff were very poor. They did not check back in with us, there was only one waiter for the whole place with another woman assisting him, and several other tables were agitated about waiting over an hour for food. While the staff was not rude, they just appeared busy and not able to attend to people as the should.  If you don't mind waiting and want to try some fun types of pierogis, it might be worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch during the week and loved it! I had the sweet cabbage pierogis and couldn't finish them they were very filling! My dad liked it so much he and my mom went back for more!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Not bad but nothing to write home about. The prices are outrageous. $16 for 6 perogies.. I also don't like that there is literally nothing else you can get to accompany them besides french fries. The option to add kielbasa or some type of protein on the side would have been nice. The ambience is blah overall and the staff doesn't seem too into being there either.. Might have gave 3 stars until I realized I was drinking an expired beer. Ugh. Nothing great about this place to draw me back.."}
{"text":"We must have arrived at Stuff'd restaurant's busiest time as all the tables and bar were occupied. Seating capacity was under 60. We were given the option of sitting on stools at a bar area that seated 4. Being excited to try this new restaurant - we accepted that seating arrangement. The area where we sat was a passing zone so traffic was great. We declined ordering from the bar and chose to share the new appetizer of Stuffed Banana Peppers. It was spicy as expected but somewhat cold thermally. We ordered the Mac & Cheese Pierogi and the Cheeseburger Pierogi entrees. As we waited, there was considerable turnover at the booths near our seating. People who came in after us in groups of 4 and 5 received their meals as we waited. Upon signaling our server, she apologized for the long wait and went to check on our order. We finally received our meals. My husband's Cheeseburger Pierogi (#6 boiled then sautéed) came on a bed of lettuce with sides of tomato and a pickle. There was a drizzle of sauce on the pierogis that tasted very much like Mickey D's special sauce. Overall, his meal was tasty. My Mac & Cheese Pierogis (#6 boiled then sautéed in butter with onions) were stuffed with elbow Mac and Cheese and placed upon a bed of what appeared to be Cheese Whiz. There were sides of sour cream as well as Sriracha sour cream. My Pierogis were quite flavorless except for the saltiness from the processed cheese. We optioned to share the Dessert Pie-rogi of #3 deep fried apple walnut \"dumplings\" with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with caramel sauce. Once again, people came and went and we still waited for our dessert. Finally we summoned the server and told her to cancel our dessert order. She apologized again for the wait. As she was canceling our dessert order - it was brought to us. Our server had removed the dessert charge from our bill and urged us to enjoy the dessert. I acquiesced as my husband was presented with the bill. Then a second server/supervisor came over with our revised bill indicating a 50% discount on our bill (the Dessert charge had been completely removed). I do not plan a return visit to Stuff'd. BTW - I have Polish heritage so I was very excited to try this new restaurant and share a review with my friends near and far. I came away very disappointed in the service aspect but thought that the varieties of Pierogis offered appeared to be interesting. I was looking forward to trying them all during repeat visits. But that isn't happening."}
{"text":"The food was great. My wife ordered the potato and cheese pirogies and it had lots of good flavor. I had the Mac and cheese pierogis. I think the noodles in the pierogis could've had more cheese but that's nitpicking. The sriracha sour cream added a nice kick to my meal too.  We both left stuffed! The service could've been more friendly and the drink and draft list were unfortunately not up to date."}
{"text":"Only giving 1 star cause I have to. Nothing I can say good about this place. Heard about it and was all excited, I mean who doesn't love pierogies?!  With it being game day and only 3 other tables of people and it wasn't busy should have been our first clue. We sat down and was told someone would be right with us, we waited no one came so we got up and got our own menu. Waitress finally comes over first thing she says is it'll be easier to tell you what we do have rather than what we dont have and gave us some sob story about how their freezer broke and blah blah. So we order 5 plates of different kinds of pierogies and so the waiting began. An hour goes by still no food just lots of promises that its coming. We never did get refills on drinks, finally threw down a $20 and was getting ready to walk out when a guy who claimed to be a manager says he'll check on our food. Another 10 minutes goes by and getting closer to game time we still had to walk to the stadium so we walked out. So disappointing!! As much as I'd like to say I understand stuff happens I can't even bring myself to say I'll try another time."}
{"text":"When I heard a pierogi bar popped up in downtown Pittsburgh, I was pretty excited. I was so glad to see that it wasn't yet another taco place. Then I saw all the bad reviews, which I'm glad I didn't listen to.   I think by the time I came here for lunch, they might have figured out some of the kinks because I enjoyed my experience here. The service was quick and we were in and out in an hour. There were so many interesting choices (such as chicken parm, mac and cheese, pulled pork, cheeseburger) and it was so hard for me to make a decision. I ultimately ordered the reuben pierogis and they were so good! The pierogis were filled with corned beef and cheese, topped with sauerkraut and dressing. You have your choice of boiled or fried pierogis, which \"boiled\" is actually boiled and then pan-fried and \"fried\" is deep fried.   I will say that this was an expensive lunch. For $16, I only got 6 reuben pierogis. I didn't see much on the menu for under $10. I may come back if I've got a hankering for pierogis, but for the price alone, I don't see myself coming back often, especially for lunch. If price isn't something you're worried about, this is a pretty cool place and definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Still early in operation, the kitchen was backed up and slow, and had run out of a couple options on the menu, but other than that it was really great!  The menu was simple, two options for preparation, boiled or fried, with a list of about 15 variations of perogies.  It had a nice bar, but the seating was fairly limited, and quiet a few people turned away after hearing the wait time.  We will definitely come back, it was delicious!  We got the potatoes and sauerkraut and the hamburger perogies, and would recommend both!"}
{"text":"Guys. I am so sad to rate Stuff'd one star, but I seriously have no other choice.   I went with 3 of my friends for a birthday dinner. When we got there, there was literally one other table. I gave our birthday cake to the nice bartender who said she would be happy to help us when we were finished with dinner. Our waitress was friendly, and helped us decide which pierogies to get. The pleasant experience basically ended there.   After we watched the entire restaurant fill up, eat, and leave, our server came back to let us know that the kitchen lost our ticket, and we would be getting our food soon. My friend and I got the blueberry mint mojito. It was ok, but we never had the opportunity to get another one because no one really came back.   At least thirty minutes later, our food finally showed up, but we were missing an order of pierogies that didn't show up at the table until everyone was done eating.  Our server was very apologetic, and it seemed like she was having a rough day, but everything about this experience was awful.   We all got cheeseburger pierogies boiled - if I were just rating those, I would have given them 3 stars. We also got fried mac and cheese pierogies, and they were doughy, covered in slimy sweet onions, and nacho cheese. I wanted them to be bomb, but they weren't and it was sad.   When we asked for help with the birthday cake, it took like 15 minutes, and all one of the servers did was drop it on the table in the grocery bag it came in and walked away. It kind of felt like something was happening all night long with the employees because as the night went on (we were there for over 2 hours), the service got worse and worse. We ate our cake as quickly as possible, our server told us our meal was comped (except for our TWO drinks) and she would be back with our check. FIFTEEN minutes later, and we still didn't have a check so another server just told us to leave. It was a real drag.   TL;DR, this place has a lot of kinks to work out, but I hope they do. It will be a long time before I think about going here again, but the concept could be really cool."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the bar at Stuff'd during a buzzing weekend in the city; pride fest and the art walk. We live in Denver and this was my hubby's first visit to the city. We were bar hopping, trying small bites at local restaurants, and exploring the town when we came upon Stuff'd. We sat at the bar and has an AWESOME time with the help of a fantastic bartender named Nathan. HE made our experience there memorable and entertaining. That grapefruit vodka mixed drink---so perfect! Conversations with him, some of the other staff, and a nice couple from Texas really made this experience one worth sharing. When you have the right people representing your company, good things happen. Thanks Nathan!"}
{"text":"I came to this cozy downtown establishment on a Friday night after a long evening work shift, and, well...it pains me to say it as a born and raised local pierogi lover, but I'm not in a rush to come back. This is due to a combination of staff and the food itself.  Let me be clear - I thought the food here was pretty good. When I was here I ordered one of their specials: a fried pierogi more or less stuffed with a thick lobster bisque. And this meal was good - unique and rich, but good! As good as it was, though, when I scanned the menu overall I thought things were a bit expensive for what was being offered. I'm not surprised - gotta pay that downtown rent somehow! But still, if I was just basing my review on the food, the pricing would Stuff'd into a \"special occasion\" category for me.  The service, though...the service unfortunately nudged Stuff'd straight into the \"no thanks\" category. I was here on a pretty quiet Friday; there were empty tables everywhere. Despite this, not ONCE did a waitress or waiter come to my table. Instead, the poor bartender ran back and forth between his post and my table!  He brought me a great drink, got my order to the kitchen, brought my order from the kitchen, and rang me out. I definitely tipped him well for doing double duty that night.  So yeah, it's a darn shame that a downtown Pittsburgh eatery didn't deliver on the amazing concept that is a pierogi bar. But while their prices and service have scared me off for the time being, at least this city isn't lacking in markets and eateries that also sell our favorite food!"}
{"text":"Daughter and I stopped by after Pirates game. Did not read the reviews until after we ate. We absolutely loved our pierogis. We ordered the cheese and potato and the pepperoni pierogi. Texture and flavor were great on both.  Plenty of carmelized onions Our waiter was attentive and kept our drinks full.  The comments on price confuse me. These are specialty pierogis...not Mrs Ts. $40 for 2 orders and salads is not out of line.  This is a unique place. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had three family members in town for the night from NY and CA and we thought we should take them for some authentic Pittsburgh pierogis. After calling Stuff'd multiple times to make a reservation and getting no answer (voicemail inbox was full), we thought to look for the restaurant's Facebook page, and saw a post there stating that their phone was out of order. Also, their FB page said they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more, anyway. We showed up at 6pm on a Saturday night for a party of five. The first thing we noticed was a high-top deuce with a big \"reserved\" sign on it (so much for only reserving for parties of 6 or more). After a few minutes, we were greeted at the door and seated. Several more minutes passed before the server came to our table. She told us that they were out of about half of the menu items: the reuben pierogis, the buffalo chicken pierogis, the chicken parm pierogis, the vegetarian pierogis, and a couple more. It didn't look that busy in there, but that was the excuse she gave for why the pierogi restaurant was nearly out of pierogis. She then disappeared for a while again. Eventually, we were able to place our order. My sister first ordered the pulled pork pierogis, but apparently in the meantime they had run out of those, too. Some of us ordered beer (the server did not seem familiar with the beer selections, and there was no printed drink list), and she had to check that they had what we wanted because several of the kegs had kicked, too. We then waited half an hour for our pierogis to arrive. When they did, my husband's order was not correct. He had ordered deep fried pierogis, but was served boiled pierogis instead - and then the server argued for a while that they were deep fried before admitting that she had made a mistake. Also, she had an extra plate of pierogis that none of us had ordered (maybe that's why they keep running out?), which she just gave to us. After serving our pierogis, she said \"oh, here's my boss\" and went outside to take pictures of a couple of guys on choppers while they loudly revved their engines right outside the door to the restaurant. Totally unprofessional! She also spent quite a bit of time chatting with the \"reserved\" deuce, who she said she was friends with (maybe that's why they were able to make a reservation despite the 6 people rule?), despite her claims about how weeded they were in there that night. The server did throw in one beer for free, which was literally the least she could possibly do to redeem herself. In short, the pierogis were good (not great, and we had to settle for whatever they actually had), and the service was pretty abysmal. Also, they were out of toilet paper in the men's room, and one of the sinks in the women's room was broken. It was really embarrassing that that's what our family will now associate with Pittsburgh restaurant service. I do not recommend Stuff'd."}
{"text":"Guys guys guys.... I'm not a picky eater but this was really bad. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be a jerk but I actually had to \"eat the two finger sandwich\" afterwards just to make myself feel better. The employees were super nice so it's nothing against them. If the food were better I'd definitely come back because they were so nice and entertaining. But the food was so greasy and both over and undercooked at the same time somehow. My first two beers were also weird tasting and flat. Please taste your food before you serve it!"}
{"text":"Just visited this place and really enjoyed it. They're going through a soft opening and the service was a touch slow, but that seems more than reasonable while they work out the kinks (and it really wasn't that bad). My group ordered the breakfast pierogies, potato and cheese pierogies, and Mac and cheese pierogies; all boiled and sautéed (fried is also an option). All were good (though I could have done without the nacho cheese on the M&C ones), but the potato and cheese ones were awesome - we all agreed we'd get those exclusively next time. All the staff were very friendly. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I went here with friends and after reading the reviews on Yelp, we were all a little skeptical. We went on a Friday night and it was busy but not packed. All four of us ordered a different pierogi entree so we could share. We weren't at all disappointed by any of the options and were pleasantly surprised given the reviews.  I can agree the service here may not be the best, but I wouldn't complain about it either. Average. And they do run out of things, which can be a disappointment, especially when they are out of seasonal items and don't update the menu. That's my biggest reason for 4 stars--update the menu when you're done serving a certain cocktail or menu item.   Overall, I would go back but this won't be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place - I really did - I just didn't.  First of all, if you're going to call yourself a pierogi bar in Pittsburgh you better have the best damn pierogies in town and sadly these were not. Don't get me wrong they were ok just not out of this world delicious. Kinda spendy too.  I thought they'd have more on the plate for the price which I would've happily paid if they were the best damn pierogies in town but they were not.     I had the buffalo chicken and hubby got the chicken parm-the buffalo chicken was too saucy so you couldn't really enjoy the flavors since everything else was so overpowered by the sauce - hubby's chicken parm was better.   With so many great places in town to eat we'll probably, sadly, never come back but glad I tried it at least once."}
{"text":"They were out of almost all the pierogis on the menu, the refrigerator was broken and they couldn't serve meat, the booth was too tight to accommodate more than 4 people, and the kitchen was backed up for 25 minutes.  Very poor service."}
{"text":"I and three friends had lunch here and it was just great.  There is a variety of pierogis and they are quite creative - we had the reuben and it was amazing.  I wish I had been hungrier.  The portions are large and one order of six fills you up.  In fact, I shared it with someone and it was plenty.  There is a full bar and it's nice to enjoy pierogis with a glass of wine, which is not possible in many pierogi places.    The location is in the middle of downtown Pittsburgh, so you have to be down there already or it's kind of a pain because you have to drive and find parking (in a big garage, in our case).  Probably the people who go here work in the area or are going to the theater.  It's in the theater district.  I would go back because I thought the food was really good."}
{"text":"Like a few others, I can't comment on the food as I didn't get a chance to try it, but I'll share my experience.  We had been planning to go out with our group to celebrate my birthday and I picked this place after seeing a couple articles on it. Then, we saw on Facebook that their phone lines were down, so my wife messaged them to make reservations for our group. They replied in a timely fashion stating that they couldn't do the time we requested and offered up a few other times. She wrote back agreeing to the time, but we never heard back in the form of a confirmation. She messaged them again, crickets.   I had a dinner meeting a few days later right around the corner, so me and couple coworkers popped in to have a drink and confirm my reservation. The bartender staff was rude when we asked for a beer list, pointing to the taps, snarled when we said we weren't ordering food and then put menus down in front of us anyway. We were almost done with our beers by the time the manager came out, and after scrolling through what looked to be hundreds of Facebook messages, he stopped at one and insisted that he replied to my wife confirming our reservation (she never got it) and then put the phone up so I could see that he had replied, but I knew they never replied, she sent me a screen shot. He took my name, pushed our reservation back 15 min from what we originally agreed upon and we never heard from them again.  We changed plans last minute, had a great meal somewhere else, with much better service."}
{"text":"Had to interrupt the bartender from a phone call to order.  Bartender proceeded to have a long phone conversation, clearly not business-related, the entire time we were at the bar and touched many of the things chopped and put into drinks for others without gloves. The staff were not particularly friendly and a child of one staff member sat in a booth unattended and played a game very loudly, which was disruptive. The menu was extensive, but the pierogies were a little over cooked. The atmosphere, decor, and location, however, were great. We will probably not be back."}
{"text":"This place tries really hard...which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.    It looks cool inside, it has a cool concept (pierogi bar), and it's conveniently located in the theatre district...but, part of me couldn't help but just say, \"meh\" on this place...no matter how bad I wanted it to be better.   The offerings are unique and fun and worthy of stepping outside one's comfort zone to try a non-traditional pierogi...but there's just something underwhelming about it all.  The service seems ok...the draft list is adequate...and the food is decent, but sadly, I wouldn't recommend this as a regular stop.   This is more of a \"once in a blue moon\" type of place that simply works because if its location.  Meh."}
{"text":"*sigh* I waited a few weeks and decided to give it another try for an early Sunday dinner (non-game day).  I stand by my prior opinion that the pierogis are really good. The food isn't the issue. It is managing the inventory and staff. After being open on a weekend without major Pittsburgh sports, they were still out of so much of the menu. Not to mention half the taps were empty.   It started with the drink list. There should be a drink list by now. Having your waitress hand you her order pad to read the bottled beers and wine is not my idea of professional. And the service is just plain bad. The staff was unpleasant and continually interrupted us. There was also a very strange encounter with a man (manager maybe?) when one of the diners commented (to himself) that $13 seemed pricy for 6 pierogis. (I agree, a bit pricey, but as I've said, they taste good.). I was with several first timers from out of town who were really excited about the place.  It reiterated that I won't be back. When we got there there was only one other couple in the place. It got busier, but t wasn't crowded by any means. Dishes and drink glasses were never cleared, and it seemed like we were just an inconvenience to the staff. This isn't a new problem, this is the same issue with the prior iterations of the restaurant. It is a shame because the concept is a good one. I work a block away, this could be a go-to place for my coworkers. They need to bring someone in to help with the execution or it is going to suffer the same fate."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate two birthdays. Big mistake. While the food wasn't terrible; the service and atmosphere were absolutely horrible. We waited over twenty minutes for \"fresh brewed iced tea\" while our server took a bike ride outside. I had to ask for refills, napkins and sugar for our tea. Every single employee at one point was not present in the building. One caused a scene about quitting and storming out the door. We were the only table in the entire restaurant and our food took well over 30 minutes. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that this wasn't good. Service it just awful they appeared unable to use their POS, tables sat with dirty plates for 30 minutes.  The food was not very good at all.  They are tiny and far overpriced. Save yourself and get some pierogi from the Thursday market in Market square."}
{"text":"we were seated fairly quickly. i looked on yelp before coming here and was very hesitant because of the bad reviews but i was pleasantly surprised! we got a very personable waitress and she was very nice! it did take a minute to get our food but the potato and cheese pierogi was very good! would come here again when in the area! proces are a little much for what you get though."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, but it was all worth it in the end. The Chicken Parm Pierogis were incredible."}
{"text":"I consider myself to be a \"yinzer\", so a pierogi restaurant is right up my alley! The menu is quite extensive, with MANY different pierogi options that I never would have even thought of... surly something for everyone!  My friend ordered the cheeseburger pierogis and could not stop raving about them. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad, which included three deep fried pierogis, on top of lettuce and shredded chicken. Next time, I would just order the pierogis, as there wasn't really much lettuce to the \"salad\". Nonetheless, the pierogis served on top were very unique and tasty. The blue cheese dressing was also delicious  (not sure if it's homemade or not, but it was very good).  They also had a great drink menu which included many local beers, as well as fun cocktails. Overall, it was a little bit pricey for what I would consider a small portion, but we enjoyed the food and drinks and the Pittsburgh feel to the restaurant. I'm excited to go back again to try out some of the other option, too."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time last night. Made reservations prior to attending show at Benedum. Arrived early prior to meeting friends. The bartenders and servers were the friendliest group of people I've seen in a long time. Once seated, our server, Stephanie, made you feel like an instant friend! The pierogies are amazing! Able to order half orders. I ordered half Reuben pierogies, and half potatoe and cheese. OMG, they were so good. Huge portions! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is ok. The traditional pierogis were very delicious and filling. The Mac and cheese pierogis we ok but the cheese on top was needed because the inside was not cheesy. Stay far away from the spinach and feta pierogis. They were not good at all. It's a nice spot in a prime location but overall I was not satisfied for the price that we paid."}
{"text":"The best pierogi's I have ever had since being in Poland. Such a great atmosphere and a very cute place. Definitely recommend going here if you're in the area or go out of your way to come here!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, and that ends the positive portion of this review.  But let's disregard the bad service, the long, long wait, the terrible value.  Their signature and most basic menu item, potato and cheese pierogies, were either Mrs. T's or an inferior version of Mrs. T's.  And the kitchen didn't even heat them properly.  They came ice-cold in the middle.  I sent them back.  20 minutes later, new ones came that were frozen in the middle.  I gave up.  With the bar so high for new restaurants downtown, with the costs so high for opening a new restaurant -- what are these guys thinking?!!!"}
{"text":"We had the potato & cheese, sweet cabbage and the spring roll pierogies. Our top favorites were the sweet cabbage and potato & cheese. The spring roll was a close second. Nice ambiance! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lobster Mac and Cheese pierogi was delicious! But just as delicious as the delicious pierogi and friendly, professional service was the well-stocked historic bar. Restaurant has a historic but informal vibe, with fantastic pierogis."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming pierogis that left me feeling Stuff'd with nacho cheese overload. The concept is there I will give them that, but this place just wasn't doing it for me. My coworkers and I arrived around 11:30 and the place was not busy at all. They basically only have 1 picnic table, a couple of booths in the back and a couple of barrels turned into high top tables. We ended up sitting at the very uncomfortable high top tables. I'm a girl that likes to cross my legs to sit and that wasn't going to happen sitting around a barrel. I will point out they do have a very nice bar area though (1 of the positives).   You get 6 pierogis that are a decent size, just not worth the price or flavor left on your taste buds. I originally wanted to order the breakfast pierogis until I seen they were $16. I am a frequent brunch goer and I have tried many different spots in and around town. My brunch entrees are never $16 so I couldn't justify it for pierogis. My coworker did end up getting them and he said they were not as good as he had hoped.   I ended up ordering the Mac n Cheese pierogis \"boiled\" because I am a big fan of Mac n Cheese. I was pretty disappointed when she brought out my plate to see large amounts of nacho cheese dumped on my plate. It also comes with sautéed onions which I'm okay with, but I'm not sure it went well with the nacho cheese. It also comes with a side of sriracha sour cream. I left it right in its origin... on the side. Sriracha sour cream and Mac n Cheese just don't belong together in my opinion. For the pierogis themselves I was hoping to see the potato filling along with the elbow noodles stuffed inside. It was basically a pierogi stuffed with buttered noodles and that's it."}
{"text":"Went with a friend at lunchtime on a Friday - one of the first 3 tables seated. Were told they were out of one type of pierogi (it's like Dunkin' running out of donuts).  Ordered promptly. Waited over 30 minutes to see the table next to us (seated just before) served, looks and smells good. Waited another 10 minutes before we saw our food - had potato/cheese and the spinach/feta. Potato/cheese came with a mess of onions, the spinach/feta had very little stuffing.  Both were good - but not $12 and $14 good, respectively! Two servers were running between tables and the bar, watched plenty of people walk in, wait and walk out. While we were waiting on food, no one around us was eating either! Checks came immediately after the food (go figure) and then we had to flag her down to pay! Over an hour in and out for what was a mediocre meal and grossly overpriced. Service was abominable. Enter at your own risk, you won't catch me back there again.   Have since been chastised about giving them a chance, etc. but their initial launch was mid-August and they were easily open a month to \"work out the kinks\". At $14 a plate, they have bigger issues than kinks. Pierogis weren't even above ordinary. Check out the other reviews - you'll see glowing comments (likely friends/family) and then experiences just like mine. Oddly enough, the reviews on FB were removed."}
{"text":"Perhaps all the bad reviews were early - we all LOVE Stuff'd. We had the best waitress any of us have had in a LONG time. She anticipated questions and answered them before we even asked them. She also suggested that we save room dessert (everyone in our party completely agrees with that recommendation) and told us we could get half orders if we wanted to try more kinds of pierogies and still have room for the amazing dessert pierogies. I can't wait to go back and try more!  The only down side is that the table was very unstable. It was cool looking (glass on a barrel), but you had to hold the glass when cutting through the pierogies or the glass would move."}
{"text":"Came here with high hopes that the ratings were not accurate. However, they were right! The experience was disappointing. We came here during a weekday during lunch. We should have gotten the hint when there was no one at restaurant at noon.  Cons: (1) the food took so long and when it finally came, the waitress said that it took a while because they were taking pictures of our food. (2) the food was cold including our fries. (3) they counted one pierogi shell as one even though it was ripped and had no stuffing. (4) cheeseburger stuffing did not have much meat inside. (5) overpriced  Pro: (1) the potatoes and sauerkraut was not bad. (2) waitress was nice Overall, I wouldn't come back here. It's expensive and not worth the quality. It was nice trying the concept but not worth it."}
{"text":"I came for dinner with a friend last week and we enjoyed our experience. It's definitely a bit spendy for pierogies, but if you are going to a pierogi bar downtown, you should be expecting the trendy factor to cost you more than buying them at a local church fest. The interior is beautiful and I loved the whole ambiance of the place. We were the first to arrive for dinner, right around 5:30 and after about 20 minutes, the place was packed!  They have extensive options, so everyone should be able to find an option they like. Mac and cheese, cheeseburger, reuban, veggie, cabbage... you can be as plain or exotic as you like! I love that they offer the option to have them fried or boiled too. We split orders of fried potato and cheese and boiled cheeseburger and really enjoyed both, although I always prefer the boiled over the fried! Each order comes with 6 pierogies, which was surprisingly enough.   The best part of our experience was easily the service. Our server, Amber was amazing. She was very polite, personable and extremely attentive. She made sure to keep our drinks flowing and took great care of us overall."}
{"text":"Very disappointing... we stopped in for dinner before a concert.... service was delayed but friendly enough. They were out of most items on the menu. The table next to us was serviced cold, stale food. Just listening to their complaints and managements obnoxious response was enough for us.... we left."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this isn't a review of the food...because it never came! My coworkers and I were super excited to try this new place for lunch. Who doesn't like the idea of pierogies stuffed in all things bad for you...and then pan- or deep-fried, right? From the moment we entered and the bartender/manager/aka PT-chef-when-hell-breaks-out-in-the-kitchen yelled at the servers for placing a party of 3 at a table for 6, and our group of 6 at two high-top rounds (which never works well). Nonetheless, we settled in, ordered our food, and 50 (yes, FIFTY) minutes later - NOTHING had come out of the kitchen but excuses and apologies (with no food in sight). No joke. We had to call it a day, left Stuff'd hungry, stopped at Sienna Mercato and 30 minutes later ordered, ate, AND paid. Ba da boom! Sorry, Stuff'd, but we won't be back soon...or ever probably."}
{"text":"Good food! I got the pulled pork pierogis. Like all the other reviews said, availability is their biggest downfall. They didn't have three of their 12 pierogi selections and even dessert that comes with three pierogis and ice cream, they were out of ice cream and this was at 12:30 on a Friday. The waitress was very nice and we got our drinks quickly."}
{"text":"Stephanie was our server ! She recommended amazing dishes ! Food was excellent ! Service awesome !  Atmosphere is quaint! Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"First off, the portions are unreal!! I had seen this place hyped up on Facebook and knew I wanted to try it. We visited late on a Friday evening after the dinner rush so we were seated promptly. The atmosphere is industrial and rustic with a full bar at the front. Our waitress, as well as all the staff we encountered, was extremely friendly and happy to give recommendations on what was popular. We ordered a couple drinks, our mules weren't that great- I think next time We would stick to beer. My boyfriend is a pierogi lover and couldn't decide. He went with the classic onion and I chose the Buffalo chicken... When our meals arrived we realized we could have split one entrée. Again, the portions are unreal!!!! I'm not a huge lover of pierogis but I did enjoy these... Especially with the Buffalo chicken on top. We will be back as there are other interesting combinations we want to try, but next time we will definitely split."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for a large group which they said they could accommodate. Place really isn't set up for bigger groups if you want to sit together comfortably. It was extremely hot in restaurant. Most of the group was served but 4 of the group had to wait an additional 10-15 minutes with no explanation.  Buffalo chicken pierogies were tasty but the shredded chicken on top was so dry it was inedible. Wanted to love this place but not overly impressed.  Will try again and order a different item."}
{"text":"Unique concept!  The Pierogi bar was a fun place to grab lunch.  They offer 1/2 orders of the pierogis here, so I went with 3 spring roll and 3 Rueben.  Perfect for the woman who wants it all.  I got them boiled, and they were lightly pan fried.  I think I should have got the spring roll fried.  The spring roll was not even close to being as good as a real spring roll.  So I don't recommend but I appreciate the creativity.  But the Rueben was fantastic.  It was a meant to be combination.  Great beer selection.  I couldn't resist getting the Evil Genius Purple Monkey Peanut Butter and Chocolate Porter.  Very good surprisingly.  Service was friendly.  Fun place all in all."}
{"text":"If you are serving pierogis in PGH you need to step up your game immediately!  I'm hoping that our experience had to do with the soft opening status....although they have been open a month.... My family LOVES pierogis. We were so excited to go and even planned our entire day around this place.  I was actually angry when we left. Here are some bullets to sum up the experience... -when we walked in the manager was yelling at a cook in front of the door -none of the staff smiles. I could write the entire review about the staff. -they ran out of chicken -they ran out of mini pierogis for the salad so they just didn't bother giving any. So it's $16 for lettuce. -our food was wrong when it came out and when they corrected it- it came back wrong again. -I paid extra for a fried egg. I got a burnt egg that was hard and not edible. -the pierogis were still frozen on the inside. Those not frozen were just cold.... - my 9 year old said \"This place is gross.\" -the manager apologized while looking off into space and then greated other customers mid sentence....but....the only good part of the night is that he gave us a discount."}
{"text":"I love this place , I think it's a great concept , in a great location. I was quite impressed by the food, it was a soft opening so the staff was still working on their end but overall it was a great experience and I would give it another shot I'm excited to try some of the other pierogies from the menu because they have such a wide variety I recommended Pierogi lover , or just someone that enjoys good food."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 but I cant justify a 4. I went in kinda without any expectations. First off, its basically the same interior as the previous Grille on Seventh, but with a few new things on the wall. We went in for lunch and there was no one else in the place. I think we say 4 patrons the whole time.   I ordered the Reuben and my coworker for the buffalo chicken in salad form (you get 3 pierogies on the salad and 6 as the entree) We also ordered a side of fries. Initially I was like mm this is pretty good. My coworker tried it and he was like yeah its good but it tastes EXACTLY like a Reuben. I know usually I'd be like oh awesome I like Reubens and it tastes the same, but in reality, it didn't taste anything like a pierogi. They even gave me the marble rye bread. All I tasted was a reuben with a little bit of crunch because I got the pierogies fried. Maybe there needed to be some potato in the pierogies along with the corned beef. Because why would I pay $16 for pierogies that taste exactly like a reuben when I can get a real reuben for less than that. It was the same with my coworkers. It really just tasted like buffalo chicken dip on a salad. It was good, just missing the pierogi mark.   It wasn't a bad experience, I just feel like if its going to be a pierogi bar, I want my entree to taste like pierogies as well as whatever they are  trying to use as a flavor."}
{"text":"Went there tonight thinking it would be a quick dinner. WRONG. The place wasn't even busy the wait staff was horrible. We were there over an hour before we got our food. They had a dog in the place. Pierogis weren't great, mrs T's is better. Drinks suck."}
{"text":"As the concept is awesome I wasn't impressed. Maybe we caught it on a poor night however. I got the boiled cheddar potato pierogis and my friend got the boiled chicken parm pierogis. Both were undercooked and doughy. Likewise I wouldn't recommend ordering any sort of speciality drink. We got two martinis that were not made correctly. If I ever go back I'll try the fried pierogis instead."}
{"text":"Nope. Not into it. Sorry to disappoint yinz but the excitement of having a restaurant dedicated to the beloved pierogi is pretty short lived once you go and actually eat said pierogies. I met my boyfriend there one night and he ordered the chicken parm pierogies and I ordered the cheeseburger. I don't  have too many issues with my order. It was what I anticipated but was pretty mediocre. The chicken parm pierogies my boyfriend got were pretty sad looking though. They looked as if they sat out and the cheese had hardened on top. They were also pierogies stuffed with chicken and then covered in chicken, sauce and cheese...For once in my life, there was just too much meat.Chicken on chicken and it wasn't very appetizing.   A couple of side notes that probably make me sound like a jerk. The waitress forgot about us a couple of times and even told us. It was pretty dead in there and I have to admit when I was 18 and a waitress, the slow times were definitely my weakest times. So I get it but she probably shouldn't have continued to tell us how she forgot we existed."}
{"text":"We had low expectations given the reviews but were pleasantly surprised. The food was great!  Service was a bit slow but overall the person was very attentive and friendly. Awesome Pierogis!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Stuff'd! The staff was super friendly and helpful. We walked I. Around 5:30, 6 on a Saturday night and it really wasn't too busy. It did start to pick up a little around 7 though. There didn't seem to be too many tables that could fit larger parties, but they accommodate. Very nice ambiance and the tables are large.  My table ordered drinks to start - a red sangria and 2 blue moons. The sangria was delicious, served in a wine glass. The Blue Moons tasted a little off, like more citrus-y than usual, but not a big deal!  We ordered a plate of pierogis each so we could all taste a few different types. We got the peachy pulled pork pierogis, the taco pierogis, and the spring roll pierogis. The pulled pork and taco ones were a huge hit - stuffed with meat and then loaded with meat and toppings. I had the spring roll pierogis and the only issue I had with them was that they sat in the soy sauce. I think if you're able to ask for it on the side, I would. It sort of overpowers the pierogis. They weren't too spicy though and overall were good. The portions were a LOT larger than I expected. These are not your typical Mrs. T pierogis. These are twice the size and you get a ton of toppings. We each only ate about 3 of the 6 pierogis we had on our plates! (Yay leftovers!!)  Overall, I am looking forward to returning sometime soon to try the Reuben and Breakfast pierogis! Great service, great food, and easy to get to location!"}
{"text":"I haven't read reviews on here yet, they have issues and kinks that need to be worked out as any new restaurant does but the food is incredible. I'm from a Polish family in Jersey, and the perogies taste exactly like my grandmother's. I'm very pleasantly surprised about this restaurant, they might be better than gooskis. Definitely worth checking out, they're a fantastic addition to the downtown Pittsburgh restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Me and co workers saw this place featured on Facebook and I thought I would give it a try.  The interior was really nice. Reclaimed wood, Edison light bulbs and a killer bar. All so far a plus.  Menu is simple showcasing that the name of the bar is pierogi. Many to choose from. I love saurkrat and potatoes. They were all that I wanted and more. Topped with chives and caramelized onions. And under the pierogi was a like of saurkrat. That buttery goodness.  Yum it was worth the price. The prices here are a little higher. But the quality and portions make up for it.  A cool idea is for the bar to create a sampler platter to try them all.   I would recommend trying this place. It's new and neat concept plus a Pittsburgh favorite dish.  They are still new so limited drink menu. I will have to come back and see of they do some cool drinks to go with the theme."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for our food to come out. Restaurant was full of tables waiting for food and wait staff was mostly MIA. Food was average and over priced. Good idea. Bad Restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh Stuff'd, I had such high hopes for you. When I heard there was going to be a pierogi restaurant in town I was beyond thrilled. I started to hear from many people that it wasn't good. I thought to myself...I'm not picky about my pierogi's so there's no way I can be disappointed. Sadly I was proven wrong.  I went in with high hopes and everything on the menu looked amazing. It was hard to pick between all of the options. After much debating between the mac n cheese and buffalo chicken I ended up going with the buffalo chicken. After hearing what my coworkers had to say about the mac n cheese I think I actually got the better pierogis's. Their plates came out completely smothered in what looked like can nacho cheese and onions. You could hardly see the pierogi's under all the cheese.   As for my buffalo chicken pierogi's, they sadly were a disappointment as well. When I think of different variations of pierogi's I expected there to be some resemblance to pierogi's with at least some potato filling somewhere in there. NOPE. No potato in sight for any of our pierogi's. At that point are they even pierogi's anymore?  One of the other main reasons I have given this place such a bad review is due to the prices. This isn't a high class restaurant so who wants to pay $14-16 for 6 pierogi's?! I probably wouldn't have been so disappointed if my terrible food was at least reasonably priced. Instead I got a terrible meal and I was out $16+ after my tip.  It's not often that I try to tell yelpers to stay clear of places. Even if I'm not a huge fan I will tell others to check it out because they may feel differently. That is not the case with Stuff'd. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped here late on a Saturday night a couple weeks ago. Apparently this was during their \"soft opening.\" Not sure when the official grand opening is. Seemed like they are still doing some renovations when we were there. Doesn't seem like a very big space but there are some tables and seats at the bar. Out waitress was very nice and service time wasn't terrible for us despite what some of he other reviewers said about slow service.   I think the concept of a place like this is cool but I'm not sure if it will be good enough to last. I think menu still needs a little work as the apps and sides weren't exciting so we didn't even get one. My husband's Asian style pierogi was tasty, it was soggy. The macaroni and cheese pierogi were tasted good. Basically, pasta stuffed in pasta with cheese. Was supposed to be served with a siracha sour cream but I tasted no actual siracha flavor. I'd be interested in coming back to see what it's like for the grand opening."}
{"text":"Happened to be in town and my coworkers and I wanted something that we couldn't get back at home and we picked this spot. It has the feel of a bar that happens to serve food but everyone was definitely there to eat. Goes without saying that there's a full bar and lots of interesting beers on tap.   Come here if you want a nice light meal. Haha!  Ok, so this is no diet food but it's fun and tasty.  The menu was inventive. Portions are HUGE. There were three of us and we all are big eaters. We ordered four plates of pierogi to share and we definitely could have been full with three. There's also an option to split an order of six pierogies into two kinds @ 3 each. That might have also been a wise option. Next time.  In order of deliciousness, we had the sauerkraut & onion, chicken marsala, lobster mac & cheese, and vegetarian pierogies. We all agreed that the veggie one was the least tasty but we were happy to have some vegetables to at least pretend that we made an effort at a balanced meal."}
{"text":"My parents invited me with them for their anniversary dinner last weekend here. We have all been wanting to try this place. When I walked in to meet my parents I was surprised at how small it was. I ordered the buffalo chicken perogeis they were good but they were 16 dollars for six perogeis thats a lot just for perogeis. The service was good and the food came out fast which was a plus. We also tried the dessert perogeis which were pumpkin pie I liked the dessert ones better than the buffalo chicken ones I ordered. Overall it was decent maybe I would come back to get dessert again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I could. I'm still sitting at the bar as I write this too. My friend and I were super excited to try this place out, sorry to say now we wish we hadn't.   The service was friendly at first and is now an absolute train wreck. The bartender, Nate, forgot our order to 10 mins after we placed it and STILL got it wrong when the order came out 1 hour later. Numerous tables had their order before us. I was given a beer I didn't order, I only ordered water. When we brought it to the manager on duties attention she was less than thrilled we bothered her. The customer service is a straight 0.   We both work in the food service industry and completely understand everyone had those days or shifts but customer service has never been something We wouldn't let slip to the side.   The half assed sorry was horrible. Seemed like it was our fault? Worst service we've ever had.. everrrrr!!! We will NEVER come here again."}
{"text":"We had a great first experience at Stuff'd! I had the spinach and feta pierogies and my husband had the cheeseburger ones. Both of us were really happy with our choices! The service was great too - we were shocked by how fast our food came out of the kitchen. We'll definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Place is amazing! Pierogis are delicious! Staff is awesome!! I love the atmosphere! A must try!"}
{"text":"We had the traditional pierogi and it was really good :-). Like this place! We are not from here so it was a good food to eat :-)"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for lunch a few days ago.  It was around 1, so after the lunch rush and pretty empty.  My experience was not fantastic, but not awful, just middle of the road.  I got the buffalo chicken salad with buffalo chicken pierogies.  It was huge!  Honestly, the buffalo chicken on the salad was better than the pierogies.  It didn't seem like there was any buffalo chicken sauce in the pierogies.  Anyway, we weren't offered anything other than water and it took a really long time for us to get our food.  We were there for about an hour and a half.  If you are a restaurant downtown, you should realize that people are on their lunch breaks and need to be in and out.  Also, remember, the reataurant was pretty empty.  I might go back with my husband as more of a novelty experience, but wouldn't make it a destination."}
{"text":"We had the best time here before going to a show at Heinz Hall! The staff was amazing, the food was great, and the drinks were creative and delicious! I will definitely be back and I'll be recommending it to my friends in addition to you strangers on the internet!"}
{"text":"Great place. Very Pittsburgh. I came with a big group and got to try a bit of everything. I could not find something I didn't like. The waitress was very accommodating and friendly too."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite before a show at the Benedum.  We were seated and ordered food relatively quickly which was great.  Unfortunately it took forever to get our perogies and fries and when it finally made it to our table it was cold.  Honestly everything tasted great and I would even say it was fantastic except it was cold.  Because we were heading to a show I did not want to send the food back......"}
{"text":"Don't go here on an empty stomach. After waiting two hours for our food in a nearly empty restaurant, my companion got so hungry that she said that she felt like she was going to start burping up blood.  Our waitress skillfully avoided us for the entirety of the two hours, and never mentioned anything about why the food was taking so long.   We tried both the Mac and Cheese pierogis and the classic Potato/Cheddar, and opted for them fried. They reached our table dry, cold, and covered with massive amounts of slimy caramelized onions. Additionally, there are no vegan options here.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The service was great. We got the breakfast Pierogis, pulled pork pierogis, classic pierogi, and the banana peppers. They were all delicious, pulled pork being our fav. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place but was very let down. For a place \"specializing\" in pierogis I expected more than over fried Mrs.Ts'.  I wish the staff focused more on customer satisfaction rather than getting stoned (which was quite obvious) especially when we were the only table in the entire restaurant (should have been a sign)."}
{"text":"I stumbled in here a couple weeks ago and ordered the chicken Marsala pierogies. I have been dying to come back and try other versions of their pierogies ever since. I have recommended this place to many people, I don't get the negative reviews. Don't trust them, trust me."}
{"text":"Ya'll worried me Yelp. After reading all the not so good reviews I decided I needed to check this out. I do appreciate the scoop on being able to order three and three when it comes to not just ordering one type of pierogi. Also these Pierogies come with zero sides. They're also pretty darn expensive for only six but they're good and that's what counts right?  I had the Mac and cheese fried pierogi and the spring roll one. They were definitely stuffed and jam packed with flavor. Will I be back? Yes. Did this place live up to the expectations and pleasantly surprise me? Yes! The staff here are also super cool. I got to meet the chef and he does stand by his flavors. Maybe all the people who wrote bad reviews went on an off day as the flavors were definitely on when I showed up."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not good. Average is the perfect word. Maybe I expected too much - but it is a Pierogi Bar right in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. The staffed seemed a bit disorganized and the menu was disappointing. I got an order of the peach pulled pork and the pork on top was cold. They were also out of the vegetarian pierogis which didn't make sense to me at all... it was a Friday night. How does that happen? Also, why aren't they prepared fresh? Finally, they were out of several beers and had only one dessert option. Glad I went so I can warn people but that's really the only reason."}
{"text":"The potato and cheese pierogis here get 4 stars! I had them boiled and fried and they're delicious. I tried the spring roll pierogi and I'm glad i ordered the cheese ones first or I would've been pretty disappointed. The service was great and the drinks were strong."}
{"text":"A great concept that was poorly executed. My friend and I came on Friday for their soft opening. The restaurant is well decorated and has a warm feel to it. We were given menus and I was surprised to see that they had their full menu out. They have a wide variety of pierogies to choose from the classic potato and cheese to buffalo chicken. The prices are on the higher end as 6 pierogies are $12-$16. We decided on ordering the potato and cheese pierogies and the spinach and feta pierogies. No one had taken our order for a while and then finally our waitress came over and said \"I am so sorry. I forgot about you.\" I was slightly appalled I have never heard a waitress say that. Anyways, she said there would be a wait, because they just opened.   Well, we did not realize how long this wait would be. We came in at 8 pm and at 9 pm, we still did not have pierogies. They also do not have any appetizers, so we could not even munch on anything. At one point, our waitress comes over and says that she is so sorry, because somehow the cooks did not get our order slip. By 9 pm, my friend and I were ready to leave, but luckily we saw her coming with our food.   So the pierogies were alright. I was expecting amazing out of this world pierogies as that is the only thing they serve and they were just average. The potato and cheese ones were lacking flavor. The spinach and feta ones were unique, but the stuffing was so little. For the price we are paying, I expected better stuffed pierogies. Also, my friend found a hair in her spinach and feta pirogues, which then turned us off.   Unfortunately, I do not think we will be back. I was very excited for this place to open, but after our terrible experience I don't think I can recommend it. It was probably our worst dining experience ever in Pittsburgh. I realize it was a soft opening, but they were clearly not ready to open. Maybe in a couple months, they will have their act together."}
{"text":"To say I was excited about a restaurant based on Pierogis is a bit of an understatement. This past Saturday I finally got a chance to check it out.   At first glance of the menu I knew it was going to be tough to decide among the plentiful pierogi options. Pulled pork, buffalo chicken, chicken parm, were strong contenders, but two of those options were sold out, which admittedly was a little annoying. Especially for it being a Saturday around 5p. But the food and vibe made up for it.  The pierogi traditionalist in me couldn't resist the pierogies with kraut.   They were friggin delicious. The kraut was sour and tangy, and the pierogis were perfectly puffed pillows of potato pleasure. Boiled then sauteed.   I enjoyed them with a profound intensity.  I also ordered the house salad which also comes with two deep fried Pierogis which was a great way to get my veggies in AND try the deep fried Pierogis. Best of both worlds if you ask me.  Stephanie, our waitress, was also amazing. She was friendly, attentive, and very sweet to my mom who Stephanie knew, recently lost her sister. Stephanie's kindness was a much needed breath of fresh air!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. This was definitely the worst dining experience I've ever had. It took them a literal hour to get our food to us. They didn't acknowledge it or apologize. On top of that they got our order wrong. The waiter would disappear for long periods of time and hardly paid any attention to us. After waiting so long we just wanted to leave. We asked for our check, but they took their time doing that as well. After waiting a half hour for our check I got up and asked the bartender to speak to a manager. I've never asked to speak to the the manager in my life. This is how bad the experience was.The bartender pretended to be the manager and did absolutely nothing. He didn't apologize or attempt to do anything. He just continued doing what he was doing. AND THE PIEROGIS AREN'T EVEN THAT GOOD. This place doesn't deserve your money."}
{"text":"We had the chicken parm pierogies and the pulled pork pierogies and they were great!  Plenty of food for your money too."}
{"text":"Even after reading the reviews, I still had high hopes for this place. However, I was sadly mistaken and should have listened a little closer to others who have visited this restaurant. The concept is great, and has so much potential to be a great place to grab dinner downtown. They seemed to lack direction and maybe management? When I was first seated we were immediately told they were out of several menu items, and that they were having supply chain problems. We were also informed they were still waiting for things such as a coffee machine, iced teas, simple things that should have been cleared up within the first week or two of business. Now I understand they haven't been open very long, but long enough that they shouldn't have so many problems and be out of so many things. We placed our order for several different Pierogis, two side salads, and one order of fries. 40-50 minutes later we finally got our COLD food. I would call the meals luke warm at best. I mean even the fries were cool. The food was however pretty good, I'm sure they would taste excellent if they were nice and hot like you expect your food to be at a restaurant. Our waitress was very nice, but not very professional.  I really hope this place can turn it around or I fear they won't be around for too long. I can't say I'll be returning unless I hear that things have changed there."}
{"text":"OH MAN!!!!! this place didn't disappoint.  We had one of EVERYTHING and was happy we did.  First off may I suggest getting a 1/2 order so that you are able to try more.  It didn't say they offered it on the menu but when I asked the server she told me that they were able to accommodate.  There was a split on the favorite....My husband was a HUGE fan of the Cheeseburger one...I however was in LOVE with the buffalo chicken ones.  If I had to find a least favorite I would say you could pass up the Mac n Cheese ones....and the dessert ones still need a little tweaking.....But man ol man I am glad we didn't live closer cause I would be here all the Time. I give an A+++ for the good eats and A+++++ for the staff.  Bartender was knowledge and personable so was our server!"}
{"text":"Great service and great bar. Got a beer and some Texas Mules, Moscow mule but with bourbon. I perosnally got the breakfast perogies and they were amazing. My wife got the peach pulled pork perogies and them too were great. Extremely would recommend this place to anyone who lives in Pittsburgh or is visiting."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here a couple of months ago and it was awful!  I wanted to like the place so much.  Their drinks were good, but the pierogis, not so much.    I had the breakfast pierogi and my husband had the cheeseburger pierogi.  Not a fan.  My plate was delivered with a  little flea on it - was grossed out.  We were 2 of 4 people in the place.  I don't recommend - huge disappointment."}
{"text":"This is really a 2-star experience, but the third star is for the wait and bar staff, who went above and beyond. We arrived at 6PM, place was nearly to capacity. Ordered drinks, which came quickly and were very good. Ordered food, fairly basic pierogi orders - we had a show to go to at 8PM, and didn't want to eat too much. After about 45 minutes, the food had yet to show, and our waitress looked upset. She talked to the manager, and made sure the order had gone through. At about 7:15PM, we were given some comped drinks, and were noticing that all of the guests around us (most of whom arrived after we did) were finishing their dinner already. The food arrived at nearly 7:30PM, which is really pretty ridiculous. But the wait staff was very apologetic, and very good to us all night. The food was actually pretty good - I'd eat here again if I thought the wait wouldn't be so long. And to top it off, the manager knew about our issue and never came by once to say anything? It would have gone a long way with us had they made time to talk to us."}
{"text":"First impressions of Stuff'd the decor was nice and the staff was very friendly. We ordered the cheeseburger pierogi and Potato and Cheese pierogi. Both boiled and seared. They far exceeded my expectations. The potato and cheese were delicious but the cheeseburger were amazing and the 'stuff'd sauce' is so good. Our server was also great! I will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"This place is very underrated (three yelp stars at time of writing). I showed up 3 weeks after their soft opening and granted they are having supply chain problems, but the Pierogi here are, as the kids would say, Dank af. Some of the best pierogi I have ever had. I would highly recommend this place. If they had been fully stocked and the menu was all hits with no misses I would definitely give five stars.   Deeper opinions: Call me old fashioned but boiled pierogi are far better than the deepfried. The boiled get pan fried after the fact (the waitress was very knowledgeable about their processes) and they end up being vastly supperior. So don't be afraid to trust in the Polish wisdom. I got sweet cabbage boiled and they were probably the best pierogie I have ever had. So if you try to go decadent with deep-fried cheeseburger and you are underwhelmed I have no sympathy for you. Since I was part of a big party, I also tried the greek, the standard, and the mac and cheese. Across the board solid but every time better boiled than fried.  They also have a fine selection of sauces.   Finally, Pie-rogie dessert? If you're like me, you're powerless to food pun portmanteaus. Fantastic, basically little pies but I dare you to be sad when eating a little pie.   I hope this place gets the chance it deserves to work out the kinks because they know how to cook em, and when it comes down to it, If that ain't the most important part of a restaurant, I don't know what is."}
{"text":"It's great to have a new spot where pierogi is the star. I was there during the \"soft opening\" and a limited menu.  The menu is full of your pierogi dreams and so very good. Many type of combinations they have and if they don't have it tell the attentive and friendly staff for an upcoming feature. They offer deep fried or boiled and pan fried (traditional style) and have add-on items like chicken. If you like pierogi you must try this place. I had the habanero watermelon chicken and the BBQ pulled  pork and they were both very delicious. I will be back to try them all. Plus a full bar and good beer selection."}
{"text":"Pierogies were tasty, good service, and nice selection on tap.  This was our first trip and we definitely want to go back. I absolutely loved the halushki. Other reviews had us concerned but the food was prompt and everything was good.  The only thing I would change was the potato and cheese pierogies by having the cheese inside and melty instead of on top."}
{"text":"I've been to Stuff'd twice and both times they were out of quite a few times on the menu. The first time, I went on a Sunday for lunch with a friend. There wasn't many people in the restaurant and we sat right at the bar. We quickly noticed it seemed like the two waitresses on staff were entirely overwhelmed. Like I said, the place wasn't crowded but they could have used another person. Anyways - it took a while to get our drink orders in. I snuck mine past the bartender and she didnt even ask if my friend would like one. Once we went to order, they were out of my first THREE options. As a vegetarian I was stoked to see how many options there were on the menu - but alas, I had to settle for the Mac n Cheese Pierogies. They were fine, not worth the $14 or $16 paid for them though. While we were there, I saw one couple walk out once they realized their only option were the mac n cheese pierogies- they also said they were vegetarians.  My second experience went a little better. I went with a male friend, on a week night - which is maybe why we were paid attention to a little more? There was a different bartender that night and he was very friendly and happy. They were again out of my first choice (the sauerkraut pierogies) and he offered to do the traditional potato and cheese with a side of sauerkraut. The traditional were much better than the mac n cheese and the sauerkraut was amazing. It had a bit of horseradish-ey mayo mixed in? Not positive - but it was good.  All in all, its a nice restaurant - but I've gone twice and they've been out of many options. The pierogies are also about $2.50 a piece - which isn't astronomical but its something to think about considering the chances of you getting what you want are slim. The closest parking garage also has a $15 weekend/night base rate - so if you plan on going to Stuff'd on the weekend or for dinner, thats another cost to consider. It quickly turns into an expensive night - and its unfortunately not all that. *shrugs*"}
