{"text":"Food is okay, I like it because this is something different.  Service is excellent, very friendly and helpful.  We'll comeback."}
{"text":"Wish there was a better selection of vegetables, spices, and sauces. Other wise it was very good. Will be back, especially if the expand the selections."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located to my work and I was in the mood for something different. The inside is nice and open, lots of windows. The staff was friendly. I thought the sauce creation was interesting and the sauces were good. I was not crazy about the meat selection. For the same price their competitors offer shrimp, scallops, and more chicken and pork types. It was 9.99 for one bowl, and 14.99 for all you can eat. After they give you rice with the meal there's no way I could do all you can eat. I think it's priced too high for lunch, and the selection doesn't hold up to their competition."}
{"text":"Outstanding stir fry with excellent service.  The ingredients are fresh, tables are clean, and most importantly the outcome is hot, healthy food."}
{"text":"Stir Krazy serves up fresh, quality ingredients and outstanding hospitality-- making this our favorite Mongolian grill.   We are happy to have 'found' them again after the move.   You can't go wrong here for healthy food and great service."}
{"text":"I've been anxiously awaiting the reopening of it and it's just as great as I remember! The food is always fresh and prepared perfectly, staff is incredibly welcoming, my entire family is addicted!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat. Beautiful staff.... quality food...
Great desserts.... outstanding prices....

I'm truly going to miss eating here...."}
{"text":"I cannot remove the one star - this should not be a star at all!!!
Owner of Franchise look out!!! We have been repeat customers for this restaurant. We use restaurant.com coupon to come over for lunch. Three weeks ago the waitress told us they are not making money and therefore we can only use one coupon per group per month. That is not what the terms and conditions are on restaurant.com
Today she rudely told us not to come back and refused service.   Because we were going to use a restaurant .com coupon."}
{"text":"I stayed at the hyatt place across the street from Stir Krazy. Without a doubt their food was amazing. When you prep your dish the employees give you tips on sauces to make sure you enjoy your food. 

Pro: You an pile up as much broccoli, carrots, beef, pork, chicken noodles and other normal ingredients associated with Mongolian meals. So stack it as high as you can;there is no limit! When I came back to the hotel room all the other guests said the food smelled good. And I agreed with them as I ate it in their faces. Shortly after and for the next few days my family and I became regulars of this place during our short time. Unfortunately when I asked the manager if I could get some commission for bringing everyone over to eat.

The prices were good also. I would definitely return! Last but not least its al you can eat if you dine in.

Con: There is not a Stir Krazy in my area."}
{"text":"I started to come here after Genghis Grill stopped their unlimited bowls. I don't come often-- only when I'm craving some Mongolian after working out. They lack ingredients that Genghis Grill and other Mongolian grills have for the price that they charge."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is good except for the meat. It is served as thin, shaved, frozen pieces, and turns out kind of dry and tough after it is stir-fried. For $15 per dinner, I'd like better quality meat."}
{"text":"Love the customer service love the fresh food cooked right in front of you just the best. If you're looking for the best stir fry this is the place to be"}
{"text":"Insanely good,and a great deal.My favorite place in Las Vegas!

Freshest veggies and best meats here,they don't mess around.I come here 3 days a week or more.

YOU GOTTA EAT HERE"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Fast and you can make your own sauces for your Mongolian beef (like stir fry). Service is great and prices are awesome. If you are in a hurry this is a great spot and it's healthy. Can't wait to come back! This place brings me back from living in Alaska and eating at twin dragons Mongolian beef. Same idea with some differences. 

I recommend highly."}
{"text":"I was apprehensive at first, but this place is now my go-to restaurant. I love the control of getting exactly what I want!"}
{"text":"great food, tastes great !! service is excellent. i will be back. the restaurant is clean & the ingredients are fresh. there is plenty of room for large parties."}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurants that have a lot of strick policies. I've been to this establishment plenty of times. And I'm really surprised with this experience I've encountered.  Especially when you have an owner that likes to tell what customers what to in their establishment, like for example, the owner is watching you preparing your own dish, and speaking to the customer and trying to embarrassing them about it.  Letting new customers know.. Beware of the pig lady."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic Mongolian BBQ. Classic 4 meat choices and tons of fantastically fresh vegetables to choose. The suggested sweet and spicy sauce was a little too much sweet and not enough spicy but first guess is always a toss up. If you are in Las Vegas and have any shred of fondness for the BBQ, you should come here."}
{"text":"They have the freshest meats and veggies. They have the best noodles and I don't like noodles. Fresh brewed ice tea on top of it. Freaking amazing place and cheap for all you can eat"}
{"text":"Such great food we usually went to the paradise location but once they changed we went to their new location so nice great customer service and great food love the place !!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and it did not disappoint!! The place was clean and food was fresh, and our server Angela was very pleasant. We are definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! The food is great and you don't need a lot of cash. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Had only 45 minutes for lunch. Waited our turn to order and everyone left to fill bowls or wash dishes. Owner said someone called in sick and pretty much we could just wait. What did we want him to do? Someone called in sick. He couldn't figure out that you take care of customers before side tasks. Disappointing visit."}
{"text":"We went to this place yesterday and it was amazing like always. We have been here a few times and the food and service is on point. This place is like none other so I cannot compare. We are from California where there are many places like this but don't compare. Not your typical Mongolian grill for sure! Fresh ingredients and great sauces are huge. This place is a drive from our house but it's worth it!!! Keep up the great food and service!!"}
{"text":"Great AYCE Mongolian BBQ!! Great variety of meats and veggies for authentic flavor. Must stop by if you're in the mood for some great food."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Great customer service for all! The restaurant is immaculately clean and the food is delicious! I will be back! I opted for the 1 trip but could easily have done AYCE since it was THAT good!"}
{"text":"Hands Down my favorite place to go to.
With an amazing staff and the food all grilled in front of your eyes. Great food. I'm glad they have all you can eat because got 2 huge plates #Worth 
This place is an experience you must try!"}
{"text":"I know what you are thinking.. Has Dana gone KRAZY?  What is she doing writing a review about a Mongolian Grill?  Here's the deal - I accompanied a few co-workers to check this place out with the understanding that I would just play the role of delightful company and would not be partaking in any of the dining portion of our excursion.  I was familiar with the whole giant slab of wok concept having seen it first hand at the Green Valley Buffet but this place is something special and you will be shocked at the twist coming up.  
Let me walk you through the process.  When you walk in you immediately see said giant wok thing and it smells really good inside which is always a good indicator.  Then of course you find a seat in the dining room and you are greeted by the kind folk who take your drink order and provide you with a bowl.  So as my friends took their bowls to the bountiful buffet I came along just to see all the excitement.  They had I believe 4-5 proteins to select and a whole bunch of veggies and other things I have no idea what they were.  Well the stars must have aligned and my chi was in the right place because something came over me and I went back and grabbed a bowl!  (This is where the shocking twist starts!)  I began placing items in the bowl.. nothing too crazy just  samples of chicken, beef, ham, pepperoni and some noodles that looked orange.  Then you are supposed to give them your bowl to cook and I was prepared to do so when our server stopped me to advise I must put some sauce on it in order for it not burn and not get stuck (probably common sense for most people but not for this kid.)  At that point I almost lost it and wanted to cry because there was quite the selection of sauces and I was scared it would ruin my bowl.   He was very patient with me and assured me that the sauces would evaporate and all would be well and he was right!  And you wait there for all of like 30 seconds to get your food.. Super-fast.
The cool thing about this place is that if you are unlike me and enjoy most foods, they have little signs above the buffet that give you \"recipes\" for you to create the ultimate bowl of goodness.  Also they have a ton of sauces at are made fresh every day.
So in conclusion I know I am not the most credible to recommend a place like this but they are a new restaurant and are currently running grand opening specials where you get all-you-can-eat dinner for like $13 dollars and lunch is even cheaper (but not all you can eat)!  My friends' bowls were so big that when they put it on the plate, along with the complimentary rice, it was quite a meal.  And think about it, this place got the pickiest eater you know to try something new.. that has to say something!  I want to bring my husband to try it out and so should you.  The End."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I happen to stop in here by chance I was on my way back home and was going to stop at the liquors store and saw this place. So I really liked the name remind me of the movie with Richard Pryor and Gene..lol 

So as I look out the window while enjoying this wonderful meal I can see the hard rock hotel and cars drive by. It's in the cut and I really love it!

Oscar keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This review is regarding the business. First off, for the price of the lunch 9.99, the food was not bad. This is why I'm giving 2 stars. As a business...I'd give zero if I could. 
To start off, they do not have labels for any of their selections. Is it steak, is it pork? I'm not sure. They have a nice sauce combo chart however with the sauces not being labeled, it was of no use. 
Now for the check. Took forever, then when I had a question about it, waited for over 3 min before having to go find the waiter. I had noticed my wife and I were charged a kids lunch (5.99) which our son who is only 2 did not eat a lunch. When I asked the waiter about this she informed me that my son shared some of my food so had to pay. Excuse me?! If this is the restaurants policy why had she not told us that at the beginning when we told her he will just have a few bites of our food! She took the charge off but let me know moving forward, if he shares we must pay. Let her know that's ok because we will not be back. 
So be warned! If you have a young child who will not be eating a lunch, touches some of your food be prepared to pay 5.99 for eating something you already paid for! I expressed to her that the food on the plate would have been eaten one way or another by myself, and it is mot AYCE so why did it matter I shared some. Her answer was \"if someone shared food, they will be charged\" this is absurd!! I've never been treated this was at any restaurant over my 2 year old son taking a couple bites off my plate! Poor business policy! You have been warned!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST and ONLY freshest food in Las Vegas, hands down. Wow! Friendly staff, prompt service, and prepared HOT for the price no one could beat. ALL YOU EAT dinner. Go try it, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So glad this place is back. Great service and selection. All you can eat for $13.99 can't be beat. Food quality excellent. Unmatched sauce variety. Way better than the other places in town. Only gripe is that it's far out from my location. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Was craving this place as a pregnancy craving lol. Drove all the way from aliante just to get it and it honestly didn't satisfy my craving too well. My lady serving the tables was so sweet though and she was moving around and hustling by herself. Service with cooking the noodles was a bit slow. Overall was a decent experience."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went the other night
I just took some more of my family today  Probably one of our new favorites"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I used to go to the location near the Hard Rock, and was so sad when the strip mall owner made them leave to make way for some stupid fast food place.  I was so excited to see it was re-opened, I have been searching the web waiting anxiously for them to announce they were back.  They are quick with service, polite and very helpful if you are new to this way of cooking. I go at least once a week now that it is open again..i would go more, but I live way up north. If you haven't tried this experience, I definitely say go!"}
{"text":"Frozen meat!!!!!! No tea no coffee, no pasta or noodles options naaaaaaa very bad place never again"}
{"text":"Great food, fresh, great service, and very food safety conscious. Highly Recommend. I used a used plate as a new bowl to add all the ingredients before the stir fry took place and they threw it all out to protect the other customer. Great example of putting their customers ahead of their bottom line."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place has closed down.  I tried to go there for lunch on Feb 13, and it was closed.  All the fixtures removed, and large chunks of ceiling tiles littered the floor.

It's a shame, I really liked this place.  Would have given it 5 stars were it still open."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have great recipes posted on the wall or you can make your own bowl, but either way your bound to make something good. It's a good price and have good healthy options."}
{"text":"Great Service and excellent food!! Lots of healthy options for everyone. Will defiantly come back especially when they get their bar put in."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and the cooks were fast, but the meal making area was dirty and our waitress wasn't very attentive. So service was extremely slow. I will be back because it's the only Mongolian BBQ in town, but am not impressed by the wait staff."}
{"text":"We love the place ! Don't hesitate to try this place.  The food was very good and great sevice. Love love love"}
{"text":"I've hit SK with the girlfriend and others several times over the last 4-5 months ( previously posted pics )  - this is our \" go-to\" mongolian spot.  usually 3-4 meat options ( they add shrimp for dinner ) and large selection of vegetables.  Not a large selection of sauces but what they have works for us.

We like that you have the noodle option before giving the bowl to the cook so they can do their magic.  They add a side of white or brown rice to the plate after everything is cooked up.

You have the option of one bowl ( under $10 ) or AYCE for a few $$ more.  

Service is prompt, a no frills kind of place.

we'll continue to visit."}
{"text":"I'm a big review guy, and here's my opinion!

Food was absolutely exceptional.
Service was outstanding.
Food preparation was very quick.
Very clean and kept up with cleanliness.

Overall I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Come here every time we're in Vegas. Love Mongolian BBQ. Plus you have the option for an all you can eat meal at just $13.99. You will roll out of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place was sooooo good! The food was delish and fresh. Ther service is super friendly too! We are thrilled to finally have an awesome Mongolian Grill in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was a solid \"good\" for me. I liked my food and there was enough options. Four of us tried it one Friday evening. The service was good and our waiter was helpful, although they are mostly there for drinks and special requests, as you're the one putting your bowl together and taking it to the grill.

If you've never been to a Mongolian grill before, it's a fun experience. I was trying to keep my options light and I believe you can do that here. However, I must have not put enough sauce on my bowl at the end of it (you need sauce no matter what to grill it - it cooks like stir fry) so the grill guys ended up torching my meal with their oil anyway. I wasn't warned that they would do that so my meal was super oily and although it was tasty, it wasn't what I was going for.

The bowls they give you seem small at first, but they end up being the right amount. My table mates liked it a lot and I'm sure we'll go back at some point, but I'm not craving it, if that makes sense!"}
{"text":"On a business trip to Vegas and really wanted some Mongolian Grill.  When we walked in for lunch the place was clean and there weren't a lot of people.  It is on the smaller side but we never felt crowed.  The food areas were clean and the food looked fresh.  We made our own bowls and everything was delicious.  The waitress was nice and kept our drinks filled.  The only negative that sticks out in my head was waiting for the chef...cook...... I don't know what to call him but the guy who moves your food around on the giant steel wheel."}
{"text":"Clean, good food choices on buffet, and very friendly service at a decent price.  This has become my \"go to\" Mongolian BBQ whenever I am in LV."}
{"text":"This is my first time I been here. The worker here are very friendly and the food is excellent to the perfection. I recommend all my coworkers and friends to this place."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place and I love it. They give you a bowl to take over to this buffet style bar then you load your ball with your choice of meats,vegetables,sauces, and noodles. They'll cook it in front of you and a choice of white rice or brown rice. I normally just load up the bowl with all the vegetables so it's great if you are in vegan or vegetarian as well."}
{"text":"I had to give them a one star because of the poor service I just got from the waitress with glasses and she had dreads with green and  black hair she went to all the tables to check on them and didn't check on me at all is it become I was the only black customer in the restaurant.Then when I told her u never came and checked on me her excuse was because u were eating well hello so is everyone else that u went to check on.I have been coming here for awhile now and never have I experienced such rude service this definitely will be my last time coming here. I don't have to spend my money here for people who are ignorant.Shame on Stir Krazy for treating people like that."}
{"text":"This is by far the best and freshest Mongolian stir fry we have been toon Las Vegas.  
Dinner is also All you can eat!!  So enjoy."}
{"text":"I am always up for fresh quality cooked food. The restaurant is clean and I like how they keep the ingredients on the station full. You are given a serving size bowl. You start at the frozen meat selection and work your way to adding more meat toppings, vegetables, a combination of sauces, and later on top your bowl with noodles. Then you wait in line to get your meal stir fry on the grill. 

It's wonderful seeing how they do an amazing job making sure the meat is thoroughly cooked while the veggies stay crisp. They ask if you would like white rice or brown rice with your meal, and they serve the Mongolian Noodles on a nice big plate. They even have a few extra sauces on the side like Sweet Chili, Sriracha, Garlic Chili, Hoisin Sauce, Teriyaki, Honey, and they have Sesame Seeds to add more flavor to your meal which I think is a bonus!

I came around lunch time ($9.99) and I enjoyed everything. I had Stir Fry Chicken with Mushroom, Zucchini, Green & Red Bell Pepper, Baby Corn, Water Chestnut mix with House made Sauce, Garlic, Pineapple, and Sesame Oil. I opt for Brown Rice and I really like the taste of the Mongolian Noodles, it's delicious. The service is great! The owner and employee I spoke to are really nice and friendly. They give you a stamp card and after your 9th meal purchase, your 10th meal is free."}
{"text":"So much to say, the service with a smile, easy to do, something different, and most of FUN. Kids love it, it's healthy, it's all you can eat for a reasonable price. I'm just wishing they served Sake or Soju Asian beers but, that's just the vice in me. Lol"}
{"text":"Had to find a place that would accommodate our large (over 25) group. It was a bit difficult to find this place but well worth it! Our server was great and did not bat an eyelash as more and more of us kept rolling in. She attended to us with a smile and cheery disposition. The food was great and we will definitely be back soon. And the best part was our waitress even took a picture of our rowdy,loud team. Thank you, Stir Krazy, for being so accommodating!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! I love the create your own style dishes. Always very clean and organized! Very attentive staff, my drink never empties. Definitely worth the drive from north vegas!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite goto for lunch.  Always delicious.  Service is great.  Would highly recommend this for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"What a trek to get to this place. A little ways from the strip but 100% worth the visit. We went to Walmart and thought this place wouldn't be to far or a walk to get to. I was wrong, it was a little bit of a hike on a really hot day and I tell you when we arrived I had definitely worked up an appetite. This food was so good and so fresh. Also very cheap. We arrived shortly after lunch and either could have the lunch deal or get the all you can eat. Coming from Canada we have very few things like this. I'd highly recommend. So much good fresh food cooked in front of you. Odd orange noodles but still tasted great!! Only thing I'd recommend is if they had a premade sauce for you after your stir fry is made."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Mongolian BBQ place I've ever been to. They have a lot of options with meat and veggies and other sides! They also have a variety of sauces to make your own combinations like curry, garlic, sweet, hot, and house sauce.  

I came here for dinner and the dinner price is about $14 but it's also AYCE. I'm all for AYCE but one bowl was good enough for me and I don't think $14 is worth it.  I would much rather come in for lunch."}
{"text":"Fresh veggies and you put it together yourself so if you don't like it, kinda your own fault ;) staff is friendly and it's a great price for all you can eat."}
{"text":"The concept and idea is extremely attractive especially, for the Vegas environment. The overall ambience of the restaurant was welcoming and clean. The food was prepared rather quickly and the customer service was quiet surprisingly welcoming. I have four issues when it comes to this restaurant. One was that meat, chicken and pork was all frozen which added a bit too much water to the dish. The second, was the selection of sauces. They had only a handful of flavors and none of which really came through on the main dishes. My third issue, was a lack of spice a station which would have aided in the flavor palet of the overall dish. My last issue was the rice, the brown was VERY dry and looked as it had been sitting in the rice cooker for about 3 HRS too long. I really, really want this be my spot for future visits but, it has to pick up its game to compete in this very competitive market."}
{"text":"I work very close to this place and finally we went in for lunch. Was surprised to see signs on the buffer that read \"no eating while at the buffet\" !? We sat down and the waitress gave each of us a bowl and explained their 'concept'. For lunch the price is $9.99 and you can create your own bowl with one bowl one trip. ($14 for all you can eat) I said $10 for one bowl? It's not a big bowl either. She said yes and I said nope and we walked out. I'm not a huge eater and probably would have gone up twice at the most but 10 bucks for a little bowl was too much! Nowhere online did they mention that! Now I know why they have no eating signs on the buffet"}
{"text":"Came here around 11:45 on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. They open at 1130am and there was already a couple of tables filled. There are several proteins to choose from, including tofu. I stuck with chicken and piled on the vegetables. They have a huge selection of fresh toppings which is great! After you picked your veggies, you add sauce. Again there was a nice variety of sauces. Only had to wait about four minutes for my order to be grilled. They ask if you want brown or white rice added, or none at all. After they grill your order, it is transferred from a bowl to a large plate, and at that time you can add hot sauce/honey/sesame seeds. It is a tiny place but decently priced for what you get. The all you can eat is definitely a better deal than a single bowl!"}
{"text":"I think the food was good but they didn't honor my coupon and didn't post any where that they didn't accept the entertainment coupon. I believe there should of been a sign saying this because that was the reason we tried going there in the first place."}
{"text":"So this was my first experience at this Mongolian place due to the Yelp ratings.  Boy what a BIG MISTAKE!!  DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!  I had an entertainment book coupon for buy entree get one free so my family chose to give it a try.  First the wait staff wasn't very friendly at all and didn't explain the process very we'll at all.  Secondly,  once I got all my ingredients in my bowl I had to project my voice towards the kitchen to find the cook to cook my food. My food was terribly OVER COOKED,  dry,  and unappealing at all and I was hungry.  I was watching the cook as he cooked it and he literally stepped away from the grill for almost 5 minutes as my food incinerated.  And it wasn't just my food.  My husband and son's dish was also well done to the point of crispyness.  Yoy dint need to be a culinary chef graduating from Culinary Institute of America to know when your grill is too hot you lower it.  I will not be returning coupon or not and deter everyone and anyone from coming here. Again, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY... so sad..."}
{"text":"Great Mongolian Bar-B-Q for Lunch and Dinner. Great food and Service. Try the Red Velvet Cake for dessert."}
{"text":"Such a great spot! 

The food is fresh, delicious, and fast! Such a great deal, too- $9.99 for lunch, $13.99 for dinner, plus, it's all you can eat! Great selection of meats, veggies, and sauces. Definitely the best option for Mongolian grill in Las Vegas- MUCH better than the others in the area, in every respect. 

The service was amazing- so friendly, fast, and considerate. 

A great dining experience, we will definitely be returning often."}
{"text":"Got excited for this place based on the reviews. Been to Genghis and many Mongolian places around the country. This was close to the worst with a small selection and frozen meats that tasted as such. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is very good very fresh vegetables but please note all there so we sauce and other sauces all have sugar in it if you're on a low-carb diet this is not for you and less you bring your own so he sauce. Or grab some regular soy sauce off the table."}
{"text":"The noodles weren't even the right kind, they didn't use any flavoring juice while cooking. I'll skip it to be honest. Plus they charged me for 2 plates when I only ordered one."}
{"text":"Liked it.  Good central location and walking distance from the Hard Rock Hotel.
The food was very tasty and the food items for your selection are numerous.  That said make sure that you know what kind of sauces to use since it can make the whole difference.  There's is a sign on top of the sauces with recommendations so pay attention.  I followed the post \"popular\" choice which was great but a bit on the salty side.  The dinner is all you can eat while the lunch is not.  Nice interior.  Will go back"}
{"text":"Sweet and simple !
You go in, the server takes your drinks, you receive your bowl, make your creation and enjoy! Staff is amazing, food is delicious (you must try new things) sauces, meats, rice, noodles, veggies, etc all fresh and tasty 
No complaints amazing place, clean environment, amazing staff, and the best flavors of Mongolian BBQ! 

For the vegan personal you are welcome too I love my meats but for friends who don't they got you covered!"}
{"text":"FREE DRINK WITH CHECK IN-- The servers were great.  He told me about this unadvertised offer.  The food was fresh and the ambience was clean and clear. I had a really great meal here.  
If you're reading this whole review, I want to recommend some recipe tips. 
Just like any wok style food, size and type matter for cooking time.  Picking larger vegetables will yield crunchier results, why smaller cut vegetables yields softer, more sauce absorbed food.  Cooking time is dependent on the meat.  Large pieces of meat can act as a wall and tofu as a base. Pile the vegetables in the middle to make a higher tower of food.  
My sauce recommendation is 1 scoop pineapple, 1 scoop hot, 3 scoops garlic (get the bottom to have garlic pieces) and 1 scoop house.   
Add some pineapple and sesame seeds.  
There aren't many restaurants like this in the area so I am thrilled about it."}
{"text":"Had the all you can eat dinner.   Choices are plenty and pretty good   Look on wall for sauce combinations.   Spatan interior was OK.   Can order brown Vs white rice and add hot sauces after its grilled for you"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night. Not crowded at all. Customer service was awesome! Super friendly. We were asked if it was out first time dining there, which it was, and had everything described to us. We got drinks and bowls within minutes. 
The stir fry bar has frozen meat, which was a little strange to me. And there's honestly not that many options to choose from. I've had a wider selection at other places. But honestly, the stir fry was still delicious. No complaints in that department. 
Overall, the experience was great. I would make it 5 stars if there were more stir fry ingredient options."}
{"text":"I wasn't too Krazy about Stir Krazy.  

The restaurant is clean with plenty of tables.  The window allows you to look into the grilling area as they cook your creation.  I think they should have walled off the area where the sink and supplies are kept.  It wasn't appealing to see that part of the back area.  

I have been to several other Mongolian BBQ restaurants.  This one failed in comparison.  I didn't feel as if they had enough options as far as meat and vegetable options.  They also didn't offer seafood choices for lunch.  I'm not sure if they offer it for dinner.  They really lacked on sauces and didn't have any dry seasonings either.  

My creation for lunch was ok. The sauces they offer didn't add any great flavor even with 4-5 ladles of their options.  One bowl was plenty for me as I piled my ingredients before handing it over to cook.  It's 9.99 for one bowl or 13.99 for AYCE if you're really hungry.  

Needless to say that I think there is need for improvement here."}
{"text":"I went here the first time a few days ago. I had been craving Mongolian BBQ and this hit the spot.
They have a huge selection of fresh vegetables: fresh spinach, baby corn, carrots, chives, onions, peppers, water chestnuts, sliced potato, mushrooms, and more. In fact by the time I was finished loading my bowl with vegetables, I didn't have space for any noodles without the risk of them sliding right off the edge of the bowl. The bowls are a bit shallow and piling on noodles lady is NOT advised. They stir fried my food up and offered a selection of brown or white rice. I ended up loving my plate but felt I hadn't gotten enough noodles so I requested an additional bowl. This time I got a small portion of noodles to add to my first dish. I was satisfied with my meal, but again the bowls are small (it's ok for dinner, because it's all you can eat). And as far as a dinner buffet, it's odd to me that you have to request a bowl instead of them leaving them stacked on the buffet table."}
{"text":"My husband got me addicted to this place. I was really skeptical at first when he told me about it, but he was so upset when the location by the strip closed; that I had to give it a go when they re-opened.  You make your bowl yourself and the people that work there are really helpful if you are lost as to what you are doing, which I always am.  I have my husband mix mine for me because I always screw it up. I find myself craving these noodles on the regular.  We live completely across town and we seem to make the haul every other Saturday now.  Even my four year old enjoys it.  The place is super clean and there is plenty of room there so the tables aren't on top of one another.  To put it nicely, this place does NOT suck!  Kudos guys!"}
{"text":"Been waiting a long time for the return of Stir Krazy to Las Vegas!!! The food and service was as great as it has always been!!!  A must visit when ever your come to vegas!!!  Keep up the awesome job you guys."}
{"text":"Place is clean and food seemed fairly fresh, but not the assorment that I am accustomed to in the Seattle area. One issue is the cook multi-tasks, so both times I went to get my food cooked I had to wait several minutes before he realized I was there. Average place nothing amazing!!"}
{"text":"Come here almost 2 times a week. All you can eat Mongolian grill. Great fresh food fast. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. You get to choose your meat, vegetables and sauces. All you can eat for only $13.99. I stumbled on to this place with a friend and we were blown away. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First AYCE Mongolian grill I've had for years. The idea is you pick your foods and the cook grills it all up in front of you. The main differentiator are the sauces. You can experiment with different combinations of the sauces to create a variety of flavors. Although the variety is rather limited, for $10 at lunch and $14 at dinner, it's definitely a bang for your buck. They even list recommended combos and what ingredients + sauces to go with them. Service was great for just two workers. Would I come back? Possibly."}
{"text":"Very clean and well ran.  The food was fresh and the price was right.  I did a lot of veggies, chicken, spicy sauce with brown rice, a keeper!  Only one thing IU think I would like would be a fresh salad bar as well.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"A must try!

This was my first time at a Mongolian grill, such as this, and I must say I like it. The concept: you get a bowl and fill it with meat (beef, chicken, turkey) and add veggies. The veggie selection is fresh and respectable, including spinach, water chestnuts, tomatoes, zucchini, mushrooms, and on and on...There's also the odd choice of adding sausage and pepperoni to your bowl. Finally, you add your sauce, you can wing it or they have recommendations. Take your bowl to the counter, and they stir fry it for you and serve it with rice. I saw others eating noodles, so it looks like you can request. 

As mentioned, this was my first time at a place like this. The waitress was super friendly. I grabbed a table and she came out to explain how it all works, then brought my cooked dish to me. Maybe it was because it was my first time, but she came to the table while I was eating offered to let me fill another bowl since my first didn't have a lot in it. Definitely a nice gesture of going above and beyond in customer service. 

The price is $10 for the bowl + $3 for drink at lunch, which gets you 1 bowl. And for dinner, it's $14 + drink for AYCE."}
{"text":"The thing about Mongolian Grill is that it's basically up to you (the customer) to make good tasting food, so no complaints there -- except that the person on the grill literally poured out the different flavoring sauces that I put in my bowl without seasoning my food with it... so my food was very bland. They were also SUPER slow -- I went up for a second bowl, and I waited fifteen minutes at the window before having to leave (and wasting a whole bowl of uncooked food) because I had to get somewhere. The selection of items is pretty small and random for a Mongolian Grill -- for some reason, they had pepperoni, pizza sausage, and cubes of ham, but no seafood, and a small selection of vegetables. There's also a sneeze guard over the food items, but it's so low that you have to basically put your face on the glass to reach many of the sauces. 

Despite all of the above, the server was nice!"}
{"text":"Good food good service. The staff and manager were friendly and the place was very clean. Good selection and safe food practice  Thank you"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant. Clean as a whistle. All fresh ingredients. All you can eat. Reasonably priced.  Will definitely be back, and often!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the selection of fresh vegetables and meats.  Very good tasting and value.  Plan on going here when we are on the East side of town."}
{"text":"When we went the place smelled like propane, so we took ours to go. The bowls were kind of small and the set up to load your bowl up is not ideal. There is a large overhang to keep the food sanitary that makes it hard to pick up the food. As a result, there is a lot of food toppling into where it doesn't belong. Everyone working there was super nice and eager to help us out, though. And everything tasted great. It's also the only mongolian BBQ place (that I know of, at least) within walking distance to UNLV so kudos for giving the UNLV students a unique option."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this stir fry place. Customer service and food was on point. We will be back for sure! Thanks guys :)"}
{"text":"100% Satisfaction !!! This establishment is AMAZING. Every time my friends and I dine here the crew is friendly, courteous, and on point!!  The restaurant is clean and the food makes me always get two plates !! they really know how to guest guests!!"}
{"text":"If you don't like it, you didn't make it right! 
Great service, very helpful for first timers."}
{"text":"I went in for my second Stir Crazy experience last night & brought family with me! If you don't like what's on your plate, the only one to blame is you. They have suggested recipes on the wall or you can just go crazy with your favorites. You never have to have the same thing. Super affordable & worth every penny. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Stir Krazy is my BIZNAZZ!!! 

I mean, how could you go wrong with AYCE Mongolian BBQ in Vegas? The selection of restaurants in Vegas at this price is slim to none. 

All I can say is, load up that bowl, as high as you can, and keep going back.

Service is prompt, food is above par, and if you can't go back for seconds, they won't charge you the AYCE price.

Don't forget the sauces. They are FIRE!!! I usually just take the whole sauce tray to my table because I can't get enough. 

Word of advice, it comes with rice so don't go crazy with the noodlez y'all! 

Definitely worth the drive out to BFE."}
{"text":"Cool new spot by UNLV with awesome lunch specials. 
You choose your ingredients n meats and the cook it for you. 
Friendly staff and lots of parking"}
{"text":"So I got to come in right when they first week they opened.
I was pretty excited to see all you can eat for $14 dollars but I still stacked my bowl to the top to the point I couldn't go for the 2nd round. 
They have a great selection and I couldn't go wrong trying no sauces on my food."}
{"text":"Came to try out this place because I bought a fundraising coupon book that benefits the schools in Vegas and saw a coupon for this place. When we got here, we were told by the server that they don't honor any coupons per the owner. The coupon says valid until dec 2018. Why would you even offer these coupons if you're not going to accept them. And ive seen coupons all over the place for this restaurant so are they just a scam to get people to come ?? What kind of restaurant offers coupons and then doesn't honor them ? A shady one.  If I liked the restaurant, I would've became a regular. I guess genghis grill will continue to be my favorite. Ridiculous & a waste of a time."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place: friendly and helpful staff, location is near my house and school, reasonable prices, amazing food!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a decent stir fry/Mongolian BBQ place in Vegas since I miss Flat Top Grill when I used to live in Illinois, and decided to try out Stir Crazy. We walked in on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was pretty empty since it was around 3 PM. We were greeted and asked to sit wherever we liked. When placing our drink order, I thought it was a little odd that they didn't serve hot tea any other warm beverages, being an Asian fusion place an all...and they only have soda and iced tea ($2.49 w/ refills). We were handed 2 bowls and we headed off to the buffet area to make our food. For lunch you can choose between $9.99 for a single bowl or $13.99 for AYCE. Dinner is AYCE only.

Since we didn't really plan on getting the AYCE option, we tried cramming as much as we could into our bowls. You can choose from 4 types of meat: pork, beef, chicken or turkey; and then add various veggies, toppings, noodles and sauces. Among the toppings were even diced ham and sausage which tasted surprisingly good with thest rest of my food. They had a pretty large selection of veggies which was great, although there are only a handful of sauce choices. Since I wasn't sure which sauce to get, I went with the house option. They have posters of recommended sauce receipes on the wall that you can try if you'd like.

Once you're done cramming your bowl, you simply bring it up to the cook at the grill and he'll ask you if you want rice. If you opt for rice, you can choose between white or brown rice, and he'll include a scoop of it on your plate alongside your cooked food. Overall, the wait time wasn't too long for our food to be cooked. Maybe 5 min for our 2 bowls.

Although our waiter, Bobby, didn't have to do much but bring us refills and our check, he was really nice and checked up on us to see how our food was. The restaurant isn't really decorated and lacks an inviting feel to it, but the food and staff were great so that didn't really matter in the end."}
{"text":"Have been missing Mongolian Grill for a while. This place fulfilled that craving perfectly. Great service and clean. Price is good too, no pressure to get the ayce but still def worth it. Will certainly be back here."}
{"text":"Walked in to the Mongolian grill to try it out and was immediately greeted by the awesome staff! Shout out to Alex to walking me through the way the meal works with everything and suggestions too!! Loved the friendly staff and the food is amazing!! It's cooked for you in front of you on a unique and amazing grill! Love this place! Will be back and definitely recommending to friends & fam! It's so close to UNLV too!"}
{"text":"Everytime I eat here I get top quality food at a great price. The service is amazing as well. I will continue to visit and cant wait for the new UNLV location to open. Also Oscar is amazing."}
{"text":"Smaller selection of items than some others.  The  line and meal prep was fast and cooked well. We were offered rice with our creation.  Service was very good and nice.  I will come back"}
{"text":"I love that this location is much closer to home, same amazing food just a lot closer. I've been here at least once a week since they recently opened. The owners are amazing guys & know how to keep things fresh and take care of their customers.. so excited to keep eating here I love how every time I make my bowl it's something different !"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some co-workers last week.  Nice clean place with plenty of tables.  There were a few people there, which is always a good sign.  The bowl is small, but I strategically piled ingredients sky high.  I didn't get any meat as I decided to do a veggie bowl.  I piled so much mushrooms, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, jalapeños, spinach and baby corn and topped it with a healthy portion of noodles.  The guys suggested which sauces to put and I can't remember which those were.  All I remember is it was 3 different sauces with approximately 3 scoops each.  After placing my bowl on the counter, the guys asked if I wanted brown or steamed rice and I opted for steamed.  I asked that they put all the noodles on top of the rice so it can be somewhat like fried rice otherwise the rice is served on the side.  It was a decent lunch spot."}
{"text":"You can't beat the all you can eat! Food is fresh, noodles are quickly cooked to order. Service was amazing and will come back again!"}
{"text":"no menu...  Bland interior...  The veggies aren't labeled. took forever to get  a soda. The lamb was good.. All the sauces were bland. much better off going to somewhere like Gengis Grill"}
{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful service. The staff is so welcoming and willing to help. If it's you first time dining here they a eager to assist and walk you through the process. A great place to take the family."}
{"text":"If you know how to do Mongolian BBQ, you won't have issues with the \"bland tasting\" as some of the other reviews have stated. Remember, you're making your own plate, they just simply cook it for you.

With that said, this place was an absolute treat for the senses! The ingredients are plentiful, and they were constantly freshening them while I was there. The service was amazing. Such an awesome staff, and the owner takes the time, and actually has a conversation with the guests to make sure they are having a great experience.

All in all - wonderful experience, GREAT food, and GREAT staff! Definitely want to go again, and again, and again!"}
{"text":"Good deal for AYCE Mongolian. Good selection of meats, veggies and sauces. Small place and can get crowded with only one cook usually. They are friendly though."}
{"text":"Love this Mongolian bbq spot. Food was delicious and they have more ingredients to add to your bowl than most Mongolian bbq joints. Friendly service. This is a new location close to UNLV."}
{"text":"Very good selection of veggies, meats, and sauces. Reasonable prices.  The restaurant is very clean, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Small cafe style grill. Owner is very personable and checks the buffet line every couple minutes. The cook is likewise diligent keeping your selection away from that of other guests while cooking. The highlight is the sauce recommendations on the wall over the buffet line. Best way to enjoy is to get seated, grab bowls and follow the plate recommendations listed. Guaranteed a mighty fine healthy high protein or vegetarian lunch and dinner. 

my experience was March 1st 2018. Stir Krazy was light on customers allowing us time to visit with the cook and owner for a few minutes. The place was amazingly clean and the food perfect. I hope the same owner has success and opens more stores. one of the best kept restaurants i've had the pleasure of visiting."}
{"text":"So Excited they're back!!! Best Mongolian Grill in Vegas. Attentive service and Yummy food."}
{"text":"A coupon from the 2018 Entertainment Book brought me and my kids in (probably never would have came if I didn't see the coupon).  When I received my check, I gave our waiter the coupon. To my dismay, he said \"we don't accept these as the Entertainment Book printed the coupon without their approval.\" How is that my problem? Why would you turn down an offer/coupon that brought in a $60 tab? It is a marketing scam. Bait and Switch. The food was good, the service was good, but because of this incident I will never be back. Make sure you ask if your coupon, offer or punch card is accepted before ordering."}
{"text":"So lets cut down to the chase. 

Lunch is 9.99 for a single trip. All you can eat is 13.99. For dinner the all you can eat price is the only option. Kids 10 and under lunch is 5.99 and 8.99 for all you can eat respectively. Dinner starts at 4 pm.

They give you a medium sized bowl to put all your meat, veggies, and sauces in. If you are doing the single trip, cram as much as you can into the bowl so you can get your money's worth. 

You hand it over to the cooks. They will ask you if you want it with steamed or brown rice. I recommend the brown since its healthier for you. Since the meats are frozen but thinly sliced, they don't take long to cook. You can actually stand there and watch them cook it and hand your plate to you after they are done cooking. The only advice to you here is that to make sure they cook it well because undercooked pork, chicken, and turkey can really make you sick.

When you bring it to your table, you have sriracha and sweet chili sauce ready to go in containers just in case you need more spicy or sweet kick to your grilled goodies. Fountain drinks are 2.49 with free refills. I asked for water. Note: Their water is straight tap. Its not filtered.

Service is decent for they really don't have to do much except get you your drinks, refills, and your check. Their location is in an ideal spot for they are right next to The Hard Rock Casino Hotel. 

Overall, I like the fact that the only time you really have to wait is when they cook your food which is a major plus. I recommend you get the all you can eat and definitely have enough time to enjoy it because it is kind of pricey. Its not the best but definitely better than Genghis Grill over in Henderson."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Make up your own ingredients and have em cook it for ya. Pretty fresh ingredients and tasty food... Need one on Westside of town."}
{"text":"I got the Mongolian beef combo and the hot Mongolian soup which was delicious.  It was better than a lot of other places I have went to. The Mongolian Beef was excellent. It came with fried rice and an egg. Amazing. The staff was great. Super friendly. It was a great experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"Thank you Restuarant.com for the Cyber Monday hook up, and I scored on a $15.00 coupon for Stir Krazy Mongolian Grill.  I kind of remembered this place on Flamingo a few years ago, but I'm more impressed with the new owners, and how much they cared about their customers, and the details on how they conduct their business.

I have to admit, I really don't like the location of this place, because it kind of tucked away, but it's a manageable drive to get here from Henderson.  If you think about it, it's only a five minute drive from terminal 3 at the airport.  

When we got to Stir Krazy, we were greeted by the owner, and he walked through the selection process of how to put the bowls together.   What caught my eyes was the freshness and selection of the vegetables to choose from, but what separate this place from the other Mongolian bbq places around the area were the sauces.  On the boards above the bar is a listing of on how to make a several different sauces for your BBQ.  The process to cook your BBQ is a couple of minutes, and then you're ready to eat.

The sauce were more light oil based, and not a powder deal I remember eating at a few other places.  Stir Krazy sauces were light, and complimented each bite without overwhelming your taste buds with that heavy soy sauce taste that most people experience at other places.  Too me, it's the sauces that make or break a Mongolian BBQ, and Stir Krazy does a great job of creating it. 

The workers at this family owned business cared about our visit with them, and check on us about four times while we where there.  Even though Restaurant.com got us there, I will visit this place soon....maybe next week."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a weekday around 5 pm and there was only one other customer finishing up and leaving. We were the only ones there the whole time we ate. I didn't mind. A group of around 5 came in as we were leaving but other than that it was just us. 

It was dinner time so it was AYCE for just $12.99, which I thought was an awesome deal! 

The stations were all clean and after we touched it, it would be cleaned again. There are a lot of veggie options, all the best stuff but there is only beef, turkey, and chicken for meats. No seafood... :( no lamb :( there is only one type of Noodles but I didn't mind this because they were the kind I always choose (Thick lo mein) but I'd be upset if I usually preferred thin noodles so I understand that some people might be... 

They have some different sauce recipes hanging up on the walls. The first plate I made I did the Mongolian Beef Sauce exactly how they suggested and it turned out too salty... my boyfriend made the Krazy Spicy sauce how they suggested it too and it also turned out too salty but woo-wee, it was definitely \"Krazy spicy!\" 

The second plate we made - we both did the sweet & spicy sauce recipe but we did half of each suggested amount and it turned out wonderful. Yum yum yummy!

The chef at the grill was nice and quick. He cooked everything perfectly. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. 

I thought the interior of the restaurant could use some decorations or something. It's boring inside... it seems dreary. But we'll return for the food!"}
{"text":"This is a great surprise find. New so a bit hard to find at first. Drove by it and had to circle back.  The Service is fantastic. There was a decent selection of choices to put in the bowls. The noodles are really good. Sauces had great flavors. Fair price for what you get. I would recommend if you like this kind of food!"}
{"text":"Great food but $13.50 for a single trip through and a Coke for lunch? Way to expensive as the bowls are tiny. You can also do 13.99 plus 2.50 for the soda for all you can eat but we're talking $17-18 for lunch

Prices need to come down or I don't see them making it. Nice people and good service but priced very high"}
{"text":"Really liked our first experience with this restaurant.  We were in town for a convention and were looking for a place for a small group of us to go and have dinner after a long day.

You can purchase a one-time plate or for a couple dollars more you can get an All-You-Can-Eat deal.  Definitely worth doing the AYCE option, IMHO.

There are many options for meat, noodles, veggies, and sauces.  Grab a bowl and create your own meal.  I like this because you can experiment with flavors each time.

Once you are happy with your creation, one of the cooks will take it to the grill and cook it thoroughly.  Then you get a plate and have the option of white or brown rice (I went with the brown - very good).

The dining area is very nice - casual, but with an upscale feel to it.  Nice atmosphere and plenty of room for groups.

Definitely looking forward to visiting again the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"So excited this placed opened! Service is very good & friendly. The food is always fresh. Most importantly the restaurant is always clean! So close to the strip but without all the traffic & crazy people everywhere. Hidden away where us locals can enjoy an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick hot lunch. Build your own plate. Fresh and delicious a great spot for low carb options."}
{"text":"I've never had this style, but really liked it. The food was so fresh and healthy. I found it easy to stick to my diet here, and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch today. It was delicious! Angie was our server, she was faaaantastic! We were a little clueless as to what to do and she helped us and gave suggestions. The bowls seem small but once it's cooked they bring your food on a plate and its really alot of food. They have brown or white rice options.  The veggies are super fresh and I particularly like their orange colored lo mein noodles. My only complaint is when your bowl fills up, it's really hard to keep stuff from falling off and it starts to fall either in other food items on the serving line or it falls on the floor. My suggestion is to put the noodles in the bowl first, then fill up your meats and veggies. The time it took to cook our food was really fast but they had just opened so there wasn't alot of patrons dining yet. Overall, a good price for lunch and we will be back. Angie is a star player, luv her!"}
{"text":"I used to go to our local Mongolian Grill restaurant in my home town when I was young. This place reminds me so much of it. The first time I walked in I was taken back to my youthful days smelling the spices and grilling vegetables. My memories take over and I'm not sure if it's actually the taste or the nostalgia that makes the food taste fantastic.

But regardless, this place is amaze balls. Oscar & Todd are very hospitable when they great their guests. The atmosphere is welcoming and the bar is clean and well maintained. It is just one of the best restaurants of this sort anywhere in Vegas. The meats are slices very thin which allows for more flavor and variety when it comes to filling up.

I can't say enough about this place. I know that a lot of times people are only to ready to trash a place when it comes to bad service. But sometimes it's nice to hear what was good about an experience, and this was definitely a great experience. I'll be back over and over for sure! Thanks guys! :-)"}
{"text":"Loved this place,  you can't get fresher ingredients anywhere else. You choose the meat, veggies, and sauce, then you get to watch everything be cooked in minutes. Excellent service, and inexpensive"}
{"text":"I drive by here at least 10 times a week, to and from work and honestly never stopped in. I sure wish I had sooner. Boyfriend has wanted a great Mongolian place for years and think we have found it. The ingredients were all fresh and the restaurant was clean. We were greeted as soon as we entered and kept sufficiently supplied with drinks and the right amount of checking in on us. I got more veggies he got more meats they were both delicious. We will certainly be back and since it is close to work I will certainly frequent for lunch."}
{"text":"What a great find, near the Hard Rock Hotel on Paradise.  You walk in order your drink, get a bowl, add your meat, fresh veggies a little pasta and then your favorite sauce or in my case sauces and they stir fry it right up for you while you wait.  Nice atmosphere and the place is clean.  Good service, what can I say bad about this place? NOTHING...

We needed a place like this for a long time and I always felt a Mongolian Grill place would do good here.  You can order one serving or go for the all you can eat.

This place highly recommended by PRVegas.com so 5 stars to Stir Krazy Mongolian Grill on Paradise."}
{"text":"It's okay , nothing too special here . I think it's a bit of a strange layout and service wasn't amazing . For a quick I don't care it will do . But Gangis grill is much better flavor and easier to work with you don't have to mix multiple sauses and then get a small portion. I would not recommend"}
{"text":"Still a good place.  But, now they charge $2.99 for shrimp.  That's not a one time charge, but rather for each and every bowl that you get.  So, be careful as you can really rack up the charges for shrimp.  Too bad as I used to love adding shrimp to my stir fry."}
{"text":"It's decent food at a decent price. This venue has All You Can Eat as standard for the $15 price. The food is pretty fresh and since you are making your own, there are endless combinations to try. The service was good on a Wednesday night. Destiny was very helpful since it was our first time."}
{"text":"Love the sauce options & various veggie options! Make your noodles loaded with garlic, sweet, spicy, or teriyaki flavors. The back options are hard to get to, so you're hard pressed against the glass reaching for the options in the back. Overall, great service, great food, & it's served up quick!"}
{"text":"This Place is Amazing MOON Balls!! The staff is so nice they treat you like family!! It's a must have in your mouth, so so tasty Nation!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I've been craving Mongolian BBQ for awhile now and there really are limited options in Vegas.

Regardless, came here based off of reviews the it lived up to the hype! Great service and great food! Everything is refilled in an expedited fashion. It wasn't too busy so no issues with waiting in line. I'd be curious to see how they'd handle a busy situation...but for us and for tonight, it was perfect. 

We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! They're new and they do all you can eat at dinner! No to go boxes tho! However the lady was so nice and she boxed it up for me anyway!"}
{"text":"Great food and fun for kids! Our server, Angela, did a great job. I live in Reno but from Portland where we had great Mongolian BBQ so was excited to find this place. Will be back every time I come to Vegas. A little hard to see from Paradise it's in the same parking lot as Kiss Putt Putt."}
{"text":"Plethora of topping and sauces, polite staff, quick service and they did not burn my food, not even slightly charred which is great. Will mos def be back!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service and fantastic food at a good price, you can't beat that! This was my first visit, but I'll definitely come back to try all the different variations, the possibilities are almost endless!"}
{"text":"Hmm what can I say about this place...it was pretty empty when I got there. I didn't know if this was a good sign of things to come but I was pleased by the service. The server was very attentive and this being my first Mongolian bbq attempt she eased me into it nicely. The food was prepared well the restaurant is clean what more can you ask for? I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have been to many Mongolian BBQ's. This one seemed small and a bit amateurish in the implementation. Looked like they wanted to put in the new location as quickly and as cheap as they could. The food turned out fine, but was awkward getting there and was way more expensive than other ones I have visited.... $13.95 vs 8.95 for all you can eat.  Service was spotty ... Owner/manager was cooking one order but was reluctant to engage my puzzled looks on how to proceed."}
{"text":"Sadly today was the worst mongolian meal I have ever had in 32 years of living in Las Vegas.

The veggies and meats were ok but the sauces terrible.  You have to have the arms of an Orangutan to get at the ones in the back. Worse luck I persevered and heaped on curry sauce, the bottom of which had white grains in it.  The food was grilled efficiently and quickly.  Then everything went from bad to worse.  The grains in the \"curry\" were none other than plain salt. 

I told the food server who merely said \"yes the curry is always salty\". 
No attempt to make any amends was made.

I rarely leave negative feedback but this meal was asking for it."}
{"text":"Very clean and delicious... friendly staff that makes sure everything is perfect. The restaurant is spotless... not very common for a Mongolian Grill for some reason. The ingredients are fresh and the meat seems to be great quality and is frozen (not sitting and spoiling). Stir Krazy is definitely worth the drive from Summerlin!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big stir fry person so when a friend of mine wanted to go here I wasn't too excited.
Until I tried it. 
I ate all of the tofu they had available haha and their noodles are SUPER YUMMY! 
Make sure you add as much sauce as possible.
I ate two big bowls which is rare for me.
At dinner time it's AYCE btw which is awesome!! I had then an opportunity to make different sauce combinations :) 

I highly recommend. Everything was clean and fresh here, good service too."}
{"text":"Wasn't 200% sure what we were walking into when we got here, stood at the door for a good half second looking confused before oscar quickly jumped up and broke it down for us. Super professional and descriptive, not to mention this guy was running the floor too, killing it to be honest. The rest of the staff was helpful and the food was pretty solid for a buffet like that, had at least three rounds. Would come back!"}
{"text":"As always wonderful Mongolian barbecue. Much better than Gingiss Grill and much more reasonably priced. Dinner all you can eat is 1399 and their ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"This place has some bomb Mongolian food! 

I absolutely love that they have suggested recipes/recommendations on the wall as to how to build your dish. It was helpful having an idea of what sauces went well together. If you're vegetarian, they also have tofu in addition to meat options. 

I thought they had a great selection of toppings, though the pizza type toppings definitely through me off. Everything was fresh though!

Everything was really clean and the staff was incredibly attentive. I came around 4:30 pm on a Monday. 

I will definitely be back the next time I'm craving Mongolian!"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves a solid 3 1/2 stars. We went to the one near the UNLV campus for lunch. Place is clean and welcoming. There is a variety of meats vegetables and sauces that you select and then give to the chef behind the counter to cook for you and you pick it up at the counter. There is table service for beverages and the service is very friendly. Also, pricing is very reasonable at about $10 per meal."}
{"text":"Yummy fresh food, and wonderful service. Only small issue is the flashfrozen meat, as it can tend to be dry and flavorless. However if you add the sauces directly to the meat and then add rest of ingredients, the meat has a chance to absorb the sauces. We will definitely be back. Hopefully they will have their liquor license by then."}
{"text":"SO bummed! They closed. You can thank the new owners of the building/plaza. They are pushing all the tenants out (I was told this from Stir Krazy and that is why the other businesses have closed as well)."}
{"text":"1st time  here,  searched online for Mongolian BBQ found this place.  I personally thought it was ok, however,  the other two that went with me,  very much enjoyed the food.  They said they would be retun. Service wss good."}
{"text":"This was our third time here and once again they did not disappoint. The food is excellent and we like seeing them cook it in front of us. My only complaints are that during dinner you have to get the all you can eat and there is no senior discount. My mom is a senior and we always have her with us and usually doesn't eat a second plate so it's not worth the $13.99 for her. Lunch is $9.99 but we havent been there for that yer because of my work schedule. They also have take out. Other than that, everything else is great. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Been here twice and everyone has been so friendly and nice. The food is always fresh and being able to mix flavors I love it here.. Great place and a great price"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing staff 
Super clean and great design. 
My new favorite lunch spot"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and great variety of meats and vegetables to make your own combo! They also had sesame seeds to sprinkle on top of your plate after they cook for you. The place was kept very clean."}
{"text":"Place is so good love coming here to eat when I have the chance :) to eating here and if a place is a good place with good food everyone really nice cause some place the workers are just rude or just look like they don't wanna be there... I like it here Real smiles I say.. Plus it's all you can eat good for me and my family"}
{"text":"UMMMM ! 2 wordss ! Addictively Amazinggg !!! Me and my husband come here multiple times a month. They are great workers! Great staff! Great Service!

Whenever we come, its clean, the food is frest and not all messy. Neatly organized and beautiful yet modern decor. Always have a staff person with a smile and constantly making sure we are ohkay. im a vegetarian and cannot stand cooking of my food and meat on same pan. So they do not hesitate or complain when requested to clean the entire grill off for me 

I have always loved mongolian food but once I came here it also made me love this restaurant by itself !

I give it  and a loyal customer till the end! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here 4 times this summer, and will continue to patronise this shop. 

Clean, helpful staff, and I like the way the meat served (looks fresh) order/waiter staff is on point.  AYCE Mongolian grill for dinner is wonderful, everything is fresh and traditional.  This shop has a great selection of fresh ingredients enough for most people's taste. They have a number sauces for spicing up or flavoring your selections after cooking on the grill. 

Mongolian grill is not a food I would eat everyday. Yet this shop does an excellent job in providing a place for this type of venue.  

I am quite pleased this location is easy to find on the Southeast side of the Vegas Valley, which I like exploring.  I dislike driving in the crowded Northwest/Summerlin area of the valley. Cadillac and Mercedes drivers do not seem to obey any traffic rules. These drivers change lanes far too often believing other should not be on their roads."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! First time trying Mongolian food and it was some of the best food I've had in awhile! Amazing customer service and very attentive to their customers! Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, great price, awesome customer service. I will definitely be back and recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Dropped in for dinner alone plus 1 to-go for my husband. It's a casual but well decorated little spot tucked in kind of a dark (but not unsafe) strip mall behind a gas station. As a first time visitor, I was unsure whether I was supposed to wait or seat myself. 

It was dinner time, so I had to pay for the all-you-can-eat, even though 1 trip to the bar was enough to fill me. I also had to pay the AYCE price for 1 to-go box. (Lunch offers a discount for only 1 trip). 

Items at the bar were very fresh. The selection was good but not great, especially for veggies and sauces. They serve rice on the side, or you can ask to have it cooked in (which I did - it was tasty this way!). The food was good, the service was friendly but not always available. 

I had a Restaurant.com voucher, but my total didn't reach the $30 minimum. The \"waitress\" allowed me to use it but subtracted the difference (with my pre-approval). 

I would suggest a few additional veggie options, and a hostess or somebody to help direct when you first enter.... at minimum better signage to seat yourself, etc. I also recommend a few more posted \"recipes\" for sauce-combos.

Overall, I will visit again if I'm nearby, but I won't go out of my way for this restaurant specifically."}
{"text":"We came during lunch, and it was pretty good. There wasn't as much options as I would like, and the oils were really difficult to reach. The staff was really friendly and efficient for only being open here a month.
There is nothing really bad about this place, it just didn't leave an impression on me."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Love being able to make my own dinner without actually cooking it haha. And Angela was an amazing server. Super friendly and always filling those waters :)."}
{"text":"I always love eating here. This place is a new addition but the menu and food is always enjoyable. Fresh vegetables with variety of meats, mix your own version of sauces. They make it right in front of you fresh. Aloha"}
{"text":"WAY OVER -PRICED! Okay awesomely great food but you guys need to up your game for 14 bucks. NO MORE SHRIMP WITHOUT PAYING EXTRA $$$. Pocket pitas, rice paper wraps, egg rolls and soup MUST be added to your AYCE deal...This is the way we roll in Cali! Not as extras but as included items. That would make things way more worthwhile to visit more often."}
{"text":"We had a nice private function here and the staff was very helpful and friendly. The food was delicious and great value. We loved it!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Super clean. Lots of vege and meat choices.  The people are great and lunch price was 24$ for two with two beverages!   My friend ate hers and I took home leftovers!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, it had good reviews, wanted to surprise my wife as she loves this type of food.....me not so much.

I must say, after heading there back in June or July 2013 to do a test drive, I was fricken impressed with the food! The other place we used to go turned me off to this type of food and Stir Krazy made me a fan again. We will be back at some point, its hard to choose with so much good food to choose from in Vegas"}
{"text":"Great place , all ingredients fresh service great food tastes great.  Can't beat it. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"So grateful to have found this restaurant.  Absolutely loved the quality of food and our waitress was so nice and helpful.  We can't wait to go back.  One of our favorite new places to eat!!!"}
{"text":"This is becoming one of our favorite healthy alternatives. Delicious!!  Just wish they would replace the turkey (a strange choice in my humble opinion) with a seafood."}
{"text":"First time here the other day, Great food, friendly staff, all you can eat, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"SO So sad I really liked this place :( Is there another here in vegas? Please someone say yes........and don't go to Genghis Grill, service sucks and so does the food.!!!!!"}
{"text":"They are usually quick to sit because never really busy. The chairs falling apart floor sticky but the worse thing is the raw buffet is always messy! The different ingredients are mixed into each other sometimes there are drippings all over and the sneeze guard was built inadequately it's not helpful the sauces are in such an awkward place it's ridiculous.  Normally understaffed but the staff always top notch friendly! Been back several times but I don't think will return anymore because the last 2 times the cook has been questionable he uses too much oil even when asked not to and uses the same utensils for all the food and doesn't scrape the grill between cooking.  I had only veggies and tofu but because of the way he cooks the food there were pieces of chicken and the flavor of chicken in my food.  Used to be good and has gone downhill pretty bad recently"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience we came for My brothers 20th Birthday on Monday the 15th at 7pm. It's all he really wanted for his birthday was to eat Mongolian BBQ. We got here having checked the times online and I also know the times from when I have come here in the past. Well we arrive with out me big appetites ready to dine and they were closed, not just closed but the guys inside which looked to be the chefs looked at us and laughed. I will tell you this And I will keep everyone posted if I do happen to find another Mongolian BBQ that is open when they say they are and doesn't laugh in the face of a loyal customer when he's looking to celebrate a special occasion, But serves me well for giving so much publicity to this place only to be laughed at by their staff."}
{"text":"Delicious food for a good price. Will keep coming back.  The staff is really friendly.  Angela was a great server very attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome new place! Lots of fresh ingredients for you to throw in a bowl then they cook for you in minutes. Comes with rice and an extra bowl for when you want more! 
A little expensive though if you don't get there for the lunch price."}
{"text":"Very good!  Very accomodating to my food allergy requests. The best in Vegas that we've found so far. Have had eaten at other places where service wasn't very good.  
Only reccomendation is that they could have wax paper for patrons to use when pressing down on food. And could benefit from a second grill so people don't have to wait so long with their food."}
{"text":"I haven't had Mongolian bbq since moving to Vegas so I was excited to see an option so close to my house. When I saw they have tofu I was sold because usually all I get to have is veggies and noodles. The restaurant is super clean and has a lot of space for seating. The employees are very friendly and happy to explain how everything works. There are signs with ingredient suggestions up on the wall incase you are unsure about what'll taste good together. There is a buffet of fresh veggies, thinly sliced meats and sauces for you to choose from. Literally something for everyone. We came here during dinner which is all you can eat for $13.99. We got our bowls together and took them
up to the cook, who greeted us with a smile and asked if we wanted rice with our plates. We waited only about 2 minutes before our food was ready to eat. I'm sure they get busy at times and you may have to wait a little longer. We had a very enjoyable experience however, the reason for my 4 out of 5 stars is due to the fact that in past experiences the typical dinner pricing is $11-$12 for all you can eat and comes with a side of soup, salad and stuff-able flat breads. I'd be happy to pay $14 if it came with a beverage and sides, not that you need that much food, BUT it would validate the price. I'm sure that we will be back, but probably not as often because $30 for 2 people to essentially eat stir fry just doesn't sit well with me."}
{"text":"So glad your back 
Best stir fry in town 
Have miss this place
No one does it better
It was sad when u left there was 
No one to ever replace the wonderful
Food and atmosphere that you created"}
{"text":"The food is great, the process is complicated and confusing. If don't want noodles or rice there isn't an option for extra veggies. This is more of a problem when you want to take your food to go. For $10.99 you get a small bowl that you need fill up with your meats and veggies. The all you can eat option is $14.99 and a much better value but you have to stay there and eat. So to pay $10.99 x 2 to make a decent no carb meal is just not worth it. Hopefully they find a better solution or offer different sized bowls and change like $4-5 extra for a bigger size."}
{"text":"I love this place
Great location nice and spaces 
And the food out of this world
I always come here for special occasions"}
{"text":"This place is okay. The ingredients are good, fresh, and well-stocked, but no better or worse than any other Mongolian stir-fry place I've been to anywhere else in the country. The service isn't all that friendly either. We went in 45 minutes before closing and the staff seemed eager to get us (and the 3 other tables dining) out the door. For the price - and in the spirit of AYCE - we expected the full 45 minutes before the staff was ready to pack up and clean the station, the floor, etc. The sauces are good though. I like spice and flavor and some other places' sauces are too sweet and limited; these sauces have depth and offer good customization. The noodles are also a nice texture; they don't get mushy when stir-fried.

I can't imagine anyone getting the non-AYCE portion and thinking they were getting a good deal, but it can be a healthier option than lots of other places (depending on what you select). I'll go back if I really crave it... Spending ~$20pp w/drinks/tip can go a long way other places."}
{"text":"Unbearable atmosphere,  not terrible food, but not up to my Asian standards.  Came here excited to experience the fun of Mongolian BBQ with my boyfriend. Was willing to pay the $14 for the experience of getting to go out dining rather than take out. The place was so hot I felt sick, the music was loud 80s hair metal that I didn't need during dinner (I do like \"welcome to the jungle\" just not during dinner),  and the giant screen featuring the latest awful news was depressing and in my face.  Unfortunately, the grill is far behind the counter so the experience of watching your food get cooked did not really happen as I'm used to it. The food was ok as far as generic American Asian food goes, but lacked the sauce I love so much that I'm used to in the bay area.  To be fair, I only wanted one serving of noodles so the all you can eat was not the selling point for me that it might be for others.  Staff was very kind and let us leave and pay for the $10 takeout even though they had given me a very large plate."}
{"text":"This is the second Stir Krazy location in town and very convenient for me when I am at work. I love the large selection of vegetables and meat choices. Great food and service!"}
{"text":"So what gripes me about this place is that they (and they don't advertise this) add an automatic 15% gratuity to parties of 6 or more. It's self serve! And it's customary to have signs telling you that prior to the bill arriving. The service was good (for what it is, water refills and cooling your food on the spot) but at the end of the day it's SELF SERVE and the place feels more like a McDonald's than a restaurant in the first place.

The food is alright, not a fan of the orange coloring in the noodles, the meat is a decent variety (but I don't know about the pepperoni or pizza sausage). I wouldn't come back, not for over $20 a person (dinner)."}
{"text":"I love Mongolian and have been looking for a good grill since moving from California. The taste and ingredients here are okay but there set up is very backwards!  As of today I'm getting sick of this place with screw ups and changes  and tired of this place taking advantage of the customers. I have been a faithful customer until now today I was not given back the incorrect change and didn't realize it until after leaving.  But waitress pissed me off not saying that though I wanted one bowl I'd be forced to pay the all you can eat price which is a force ! Then tells me I can't take what I don't eat with me ,they'd toss it out like are you for real you people are sick it's against my religion to waste food. I will not be back until they fix these silly issue. There is are new BBQ spots on the west end of town now && they have a way better set up and enjoyable experience ,cheap, affordable prices not like this place that's trying their best to rob the community blind"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, i'm not much of eating mangolian grill person. But my friend took me here to try it out and I absolutely LOVE IT!!!! 
May be off the strip but the seasoning is really good! It has a lot of different options!! 
defininately try to come back here before I head back to LA and will come back here when i travel to Vegas again! 

really great staff too!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! My first visit and I was impressed. The Lunch special is 1 bowl for $9.99. I guess if you can make a creative stack masterpiece you get a good value. You can also add Brown or White rice (about an ice cream scoops worth). Dinner is $13.99 AYCE with No to go boxes. Makes sense. Kids 10 and under are $5.99 for lunch and $8.99 for dinner. This is a bit high for kids meals, but it is AYCE so if you have a hungry kid then come here. My kids wouldn't eat enough for the $8.99 dinner to be worth it. They do charge $2.49 for a drink with free refills. I guess this is where they get you because I think this is high for a drink so you may want to stick with water. I was celebrating a friends birthday lunch and this was her choice. I was a little intimidated at first because I didn't know the system. I was fortunate to have come with people who knew what to do. It is not a hard concept to get down and there are people that are there to help you if you don't know what is in the buffet.   The only bad thing which is pretty much my fault is that I have been using the Myfitnesspal app to record my meals and calories and I had no idea what to put in there because I couldn't remember what I stacked on! I just kept putting meat, veggies and then the noodles. It was so yummy I don't really much care. Maybe add some nutrition information right in front of my face so I stick with more veggies next time! I will be back and I will recommend for my International students to stop by as well. It's close by and a good value. The restaurant is also a decent size with a good table layout to accommodate a lot of people. I was lucky that my lunch was treated by a friend so I did not check if they would do separate checks with larger groups. That would make it that much better."}
{"text":"Decided to try this location out. I didn't like the orange noodles that came with the stir fry. I wish they had more options instead of just those noodles. I recommend putting the noodles in first cause it over fills the bowl at the end. There weren't many options for sauces and the ingredients. I prefer genghis grill over this place. This place does have all you can eat but their one bowl is pretty big for just one round."}
{"text":"Awesome reopening~!! Love all the ingredients that is offered and great value! All you can eat and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Loved Stir Krazy! Their Meat selection was great.  I tried the sweet and spicy bowl and loved it.  I highly recommend if you like Mongolian style dining"}
{"text":"Decent Mongolian grill. Not the best but not bad.

It's what you would expect from a Mongolian BBQ style place. They have a decent selection of meats and veggies, however the selection of sauces is not the best. They also only have 1 style of noodles. 

One bowl was 9.99 and all you can eat was like $13.99 I believe. I bit more than other places I've been to. You also have to wait for the server to bring you the bowls you can't just get them yourself. 

Service was friendly however the guy at the grill seemed to always be busy doing other stuff when I showed up. Maybe because it's a small place and there was only maybe 2 other people there.

Overall decent place would come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Really good food. The service was fast but the food was very good. I'd suggest this restaurant to anyone who enjoys Mongolian."}
{"text":"Great concept...$9.95 special. They give you a bowl & you add the items & sauce that you want & they cook it for you on an open Mongolian grill. Fast & good service."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome! It's conveniently close to UNLV for students, it's affordable and their options are continuously growing. I'm excited to see what's next for Stir Krazy! 

There are \"recommended\" noodle pairing for every taste bud, just in case you don't feel like doing your own things. 

Less than 2 weeks since they've opened but this place shows a lot of promise, the owners are super friendly and love to come say hi!

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"So this isn't my preferable type of cuisine but I still give it 4 stars because the food was fresh and service was good. I came here with my fiancé and his BIL who was in town on business. Since the BIL is a vegetarian it can be challenging to find places that we'll all enjoy eating. I remembered that I had bookmarked this location and everyone was in agreement. It's a buffet style make your own dish place so you can choose what type of meat,  veggies,  sauces and either rice or noodles that you want. The key to success here is creating a sauce you like. If you want seafood ask for it,  they keep it in the back ;)"}
{"text":"The food is good, the servers and cooks are friendly.  I would give it 5 stars but it could have a better variety of ingredients and also sauces.  The chicken and beef were cooked to perfection!

Some Mongolian grill restaurants charge more, some charge less.  Some have more ingredients to go with your stir fry, like noodles, fried rice, or tortillas.  Some have more options like a salad bar.  This one is simple.  

They have a selection of meats, beef, chicken, pork, turkey.  Then they have assorted veggies, and a couple of more meat options- sausage made to look like ground beef, pepperoni, and ham.  Then they have a bowl of noodles which seem like pasta noodles.  Lastly they have their limited sauce options.  

For what they have, it is good food at a decent price.  If you go home hungry or not satisfied it is not their fault.  When the craving for a good Mongolian Stir Fry occurs, this place should definitely be on your list.  

The only things I could suggest- more flavorful sauce options, more ingredients, possibly more options for rice/noodles, and eggs."}
{"text":"Awesomemmmmme.  

In Vegas for a week staying w some friends.  We've been there a few times, love it.  

I think the \"its bland with not much taste\" comments from others mean they didn't mess around with the sauces as much as possible.  To me, that's just kinda a sign that they're not adding a ton of crap on the food, so its a good thing IMO, but yeah I may wrong on that one :p"}
{"text":"Been looking for a spot like this for a long time.  The freshest food you can get, cooked right in front of your eyes. All you can eat or take out is available.  Tasted great. I'll be returning and telling everyone about this place."}
{"text":"So, another small business killed by big business.  Apparently Landlord forced them out so a Buffalo Wild Wings can go in.  Wells see if it's true."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, I've been looking for a good Mongolian restaurant, I wish it wasn't so far!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best Mongolian BBQ restaurant I have ever been to bring your own booze,  enjoy the quick fast food timing with the restaurant atmosphere,  the staff are the most friendliest people you will meet. I wish there was one in San Diego. Did I mention it was all you can eat."}
{"text":"It's a new place, looks good and clean. As far as the food I give it a 8 out of 10. All you can eat Mongolian food."}
{"text":"I used to go to the old location with my little brother who by the way is very picky with authentic food. Well, we just had a birthday dinner for him on Sunday and all i can say is WOW, the service and food were both excellent. We were treated like family and that is hard to find now and days. I found myself so surprised that the co-stars were as young as they were with such professionalism as I come from a hospitality background I like to thank good service.

The food was also fantastic!!! If you like FRESH food, this is the place to be. If you YELP about a location such as this and have challenges with the plate YOU served, you should read the recommend and house favorites board, that will give you a better idea on how to prepare your dish. 

I will be back again very soon or should I say the 30 of us will!

Cheers to you Stir Krazy!!!!"}
{"text":"first off awesome staff! angela helped us create an amazing flavorful lunch for our first visit thank you angela!!! must try!! fresh meats and vegetables! sauces on point! the best experience for a first time visit! will be back again most definitely!"}
{"text":"The best Mongolian in town! For years we have been missing having a good Mongolian restaurant in Vegas and FINALLY we got this place! It's very good and a great value. Lots of veggies, etc to choose from. Good quality. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I am very sad.   Last Friday I pulled up to get some dinner and they were closed :(   I had just taken my mom there 2 weeks earlier.    

Never had a bad experience at this place and I hit it up every chance possible.   This was my favorite spot for grub in Las Vegas, easily.    There is nothing else like this in the valley.    I wonder what could have happened?

The food was always excellent.  Fresh meats, fresh veggies.   Very reasonable prices.    Its one of the few places you could get a healthy meal in this town.

I am sad."}
{"text":"They are back at a new location and the quality and deliciousness is just as it was before.   It's on the other side of town from me but we try to go once a month and the food and service here never disappoints.   

We went on a Saturday during lunch time and was shocked to be the only customers.  I hope this location stays open because there is nothing else like this in Vegas.   

It's a simple concept.  Build your bowl the way you want.  Choose the meats, veggies, and sauces.  Top it off with noodles.   You can get real creative here, but the noodles are the star here.  Absolutely amazing.

Very very happy to be able to have Stir Krazy in my life once more."}
{"text":"After searching for a Mongolian place like cali we finally found it and it was great! Clean food area, staff was great. Destinie was very helpful and provided great service. We definitely recommend it and will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"The best Mongolian Grill I have been to! A huge selection of fresh ingredients and sauces."}
{"text":"Great food for good price. They could benefit from removing the sauces from the end of the line and placing another area. Gets a little congested with Al the sauce building options. Maybe some sopapillas as a lite dessert type option or just with your dinner one for each guest.
A little honey and perfect balance to a bow with some heat. Team is young but very courteous and attentive. Good family environment."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a grill like this in Las Vegas since the day I moved to the city. I am very happy I found one right here in Henderson area. The staff is great and the seating and atmosphere is nice at anytime you go."}
{"text":"It's not just the fact that they don't have any real competition in this area that makes them worth checking out. Price is decent and food is good. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection to choose from for anyone that likes Mongolian BBQ/stir fry. The staff is very friendly and is eager to help you come up with the best dish possible. Dinner is all you can eat so you won't leave this place hungry. I'd recommend it to anyone. 5 stars."}
{"text":"My roommate is addicted to this place.  Casual but good food.  Nice to know exactly what you are eating and can adjust the condiments and sauces as we please.  The meat quality is important to me.  They had good meet, still semi frozen.  Lots of veggies to choose from.  The grill makes everything yummy.  I like mine cooked for a little extra time.  Roommate likes adante veggies.  You can specify that to the chef."}
{"text":"Yummy!

I was really excited to see a Mongolian Grill open up that was not a pay by the meat or crazy expensive. Yes, you pay for one to go through with the bowl, but that is more than enough for me! Start out with the meat, throw on the sauce, the meat melts a little, then toss on all the vegetables you could want. I'm not into noodles, but they have those, too. You have every sauce you want and you can put on as much as you want. Trust me, the portion is generous and the price is good. Every time I've come here I've been met with a beautiful smile and I've been in and out in a couple of minutes. They also have a very nice dining room if you want to stay and eat there. This place is good for groups."}
{"text":"Very good food and good quality ingredients. The meat is not fatty and there are plenty of delicious heatly ingredients. You can add as much or as little meats and vegetables  you want. The food is cooked very quickly and comes out fresh and hot.  Very nice staff. We will be back again for sure even though it is about 30 minutes from our house."}
{"text":"Myself and several colleagues have been coming here since they opened. This was my fourth visit personally, and they definitely deserve a great review. The food is delicious, the dining room has always been very clean, and the staff have all been very personable and kind. Very close to UNLV off S. Maryland Parkway. Good food, decent prices and great service. 5 starts in my opinion :)"}
{"text":"Interesting concept.  I followed one of the recipes on the board.  it was okay.  Dinner is an all-you-care-to-eat price, but still too expensive in my opinion.  While I was there many customers came and went.  It's appears to be popular, just not for me."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and helpful staff! Will return again and bring a friend :)"}
{"text":"Great lunch special. 10bucks for all you can eat. The selection was fresh and cooked well. It is not too busy at lunch. This place is awesome and I'm sure I will become a regular. It is right across the street from hard rock"}
{"text":"The food was made quickly. The service was polite and punctual. The restaurant was pretty clean, but I would prefer Genghis grill only about 10 minutes away.

These guys are nice, but until they have more options I don't think I would return. There is no seafood, and I love to do kind of a mongolian jambalaya whenever I'm at a place like this. So I was hoping for shrimp which obviously wasn't available. 

Also, the meat sits frozen in the buffet/bowl prep area which is a change from the fresh looking thawed out meats I've seen elsewhere. They had a smaller selection of pretty much everything. Meats were limited, veggies were limited, seasoning was scarce, sauces were scarce, and as I said no seafood at all. Even starch options were more limited. 

Nice people, nice service, and a clean place, but for mongolian I would prefer more choices."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED this place! I want to go back to Vegas just to eat here. I'm pretty sure that I liked it as much as I did not because I was pregnant when I went, but because it was good food and fresh. My husband loved it as well. The service was great, no empty glasses and no dirty dishes building up on the table. Try out the recipes on the wall, they're there for a very good reason."}
{"text":"Dirty, confusing, understaffed.
Came in about 6pm on a Saturday and there were 5 empty tables... 4 of them were still dirty.

The meat and foods were really great quality. They have lunch for 9.99 or 13.99 all you can eat. The sauces however are in a awkward spot and hard to reach. You also have to do 3-4 scoops of oil/sauces to even taste anything because the chefs douse your whole entree with oil. I don't know if the cooks had proper training because they use the same spatula on all of the foods (cross contamination ) and cooked mine and another persons food with the same spatulas next to each other. They also kept mixing up who's food was who's and kept giving me the wrong food.

I only liked the beef, chicken, waterchess nuts, and babycorn. Hold off on the weird orange noodles."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Just as good as the old location... I just wish it wasn't so far! Loved everything! They have a good selection for vegans and vegetarians, and they quickly filled up the tofu when it was running low. My husband was also super impressed, and the service was just too notch. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First off, ive been eating mongolian bbq ever since it was invented 200 years ago when the first mongol hordes invaded china. While the previous claims may be a bit exaggerated, I have had plenty of mongolian bbq.  

Compared to all the mongolian restaurants i have ever been this one is pretty good for a couple reasons.  First It has a large selection of ingredients.  
Thats really important in any buffet style retaurant.  They had your normal stuff, but a lot of extras you dont normally see like tofu, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, zucchinis, red bell peppers, spinach and some weird ones like pepperoni, sausage bits.  They even offered brown rice.  Second, the ingredients were super fresh.  The meat wasnt chewy and tasted tender.  It didnt have the rough consistency or dryness of poor meat cuts.  They had the standard selection, beef chicken turkey and pork.  

Onto The areas that could be improved.  I didnt like the curry sauce at all.  Wish They could have added some fruit and salad area.  But thats not usually found in a mongolian bbq.  They didnt have the traditional sesame bun but thats also not a big deal.  

Overall you notice the small nuances this place offers that are different.  And thats what makes it stand out.  All for 13.99, not bad for all you can eat.  Having said that, after the first two bowls my enjoyment went down significantly.  I realized as much as i liked mongolian bbq its not a cuisine i would eat often.  But this place is definitley the place for me to go if i feel like mongolian.

Now i went for dinner so between the 9.99 per bowl vs Ayce, i think ayce is the way to go. But for lunch they probably need to get a lunch special price.  9.99 is really a forced upsell.  But im hardly ever going for ayce for lunch, so i think they are hurting their own lunch business as i would only come here for dinner."}
{"text":"We have to petition this restaurant back into service Stir krazy is by far the best in its class and to me in  the top 10 for restaurants in Las Vegas. If its marketing and advertisement problem I hope they reach out to me so we can get this fine establishment back running."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mongolian bbq east of Mongolia and i would say ranking top ten must eats in las vegas. although it is off the strip take advantage of this great fresh food offered in this establishment. I make sure i stop here every time i came to sin city being a los angeles native."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to spots when I'm at the office all day, food is super fresh and oooo so so tasty it's a must try and I guarantee  you will be back !! Portions are as big as you can pile in their self serve bowl take it to the counter and the chef cooks it all up on a large round hibachi style grill this place is mouth watering good don't forget to use the sauce suggestions and add garlic so yummy"}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I searched for this place on the way home from the airport. When I finally found it, I think I had over-hyped the idea of the place a little bit, and while the food actually met my overworked expectations, the service was more than a little disappointing. 

First of all, whenever I walk in to a restaurant, I would like to at least be greeted by somebody - or even a sign saying to please seat yourself. I stood around looking for someone for a good minute or two before one of the guys working the grill informed me that it's self seating. I proceeded to find a table, and then go to the bar to make my first selections. While there was a ton of things to add to my meal, there was nothing to put anything in. Quite confused at this point, I returned to the helpful wok-master, who explained that a waitress would bring me bowls and my drinks. This is the first I had heard of the phantom waitress, so I went back to the table to wait. When she finally arrived, I was able to at long last partake of the wonderful bounty. 

The food was everything I had wanted and more! Ever bite packed with flavor from their assortment of seasoning. The food wiped the lack of attention from my server completely from my mind - that is, of course, until I needed another bowl. I had the same issue getting my check at the end of the meal. I really want to give this place four or even five stars, but the lackluster service really killed the overall experience."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great customer service, great price. 13.99(dinner) for ALL you can eat! If this isn't Mongolian food heaven on earth, I don't know what is. Lol Employees are VERY attentive, and nice. Nice setting, and clean. I wish LA had one of these. Must try."}
{"text":"Loved the house sauce....sheer perfection. The owner/manager came by while we were eating, as it was unusually slow for them. Nice guy. The food was kept at perfect temperatures and checked regularly. This is one place I will visit regularly when in Vegas."}
{"text":"When I lived in California, I was always able to find Mongolian BBQ in pretty much any mall near my house. However, I was disappointed to find that there weren't any here in Vegas! When I was in California, I was known as the Mongolian BBQ expert to my family and friends because of my flawless meat, veggie, and noodle stacking technique, and also for mastering the art of combining sauces. When I stack my bowl, I stack it high. 

When I learned that Stir Krazy had opened and that it was fairly close to UNLV, I was ecstatic! I was ready to bust out my old bowl stacking skills and devour the deliciousness I had been missing for quite some time now. 

I've gone to Stir Krazy a total of 2 times so far, and had I been giving the rating based off the first visit alone, I wouldn't have given them the four stars I am now. However, the second trip definitely made up for the first. Let me explain why..

The First Trip: On my first trip to Stir Krazy I was excited and ready. Visions of flowing noodles, meat, and veggies filled my mind and made my mouth water. My friends and I walked in, took our bowls and started to fill them up. Halfway through, we happened to find out that they did not have any noodles, because they didn't receive their shipment that day. My friends and I were greatly disappointed since the main reason we were there was for the noodles! We were also kind of upset since we had already filled our bowls and could no longer leave. We still ate our food with rice instead, and since it tasted okay, I decided to come back another day and give Stir Krazy a second chance.

The Second Trip: The second trip to Stir Krazy was great. We were promptly seated and handed our bowls so we could begin our feast. I doubled checked that the noodles were there this time, so I was greatly pleased. I stacked my veggies, meat, and noodles high. Added 3 scoops of the house sauce, 1 scoop of the sweet, 1 scoop of garlic, and 1 scoop of their chili sauce. Besides all that I added a bit of baked sesame seeds and a dash of honey.  Booooy was it tasty. Everything absorbed the sauce and really tasted flavorful. It was after the first bite that I decided to give Stir Krazy my seal of approval.

I highly recommend that you take a chance and visit this restaurant. The food is good, the staff is friendly, and the prices are average for Mongolian BBQ.

 A quick tip that I can pass on is to carry a napkin with you to stack the bowl. Having a napkin allows you to push the meat down to match the bowl's shape, and place as many veggies as you can inside. After, push the veggies down with the napkin so it's an even surface. I usually add the sauces right after adding the meat and veggies, but before adding the noodles. This makes it less messy and you don't run the risk of having your noodles fall over! :)"}
{"text":"We live on the complete other side of town but make the trek just for this place!  We love the food and the different sauce and ways to load your bowl recipes on the wall are awesome for new ways to work your selections. The owner is as sweet as can be and always looks for ways to improve her offerings.  Don't miss the peanuts as they add great flavor to all the different styles of stir fry.  The noodles are my absolute favorite and swirl them up on the tongs so they fit masterfully on the top of my pile of meat and veggies for my perfect plate of yumminess. I also love the hot and spicy sauce recipe with the garlic, spice and pineapple all blended together.  I never feel like their recipes lead to oily stir fry and there is always amazing flavor.  The freeze frozen meat (chicken, beef, pork, turkey and maybe I am forgetting some) are super easy and when cooked they are the best and most tender pieces to offset all the veggies.  I also love incorporating the bean sprouts for some crunch.  I am telling you I wish the owner had a location closer to Mountains Edge as we would eat this almost twice a week if we could!  Plus it is all you can eat for dinner (lunch is one visit /plate) and can be a healthy dinner options for those watching carbs and eating lots of protein as you can forgo the rice.  Yum, yum, yum!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Mongolian BBQ for a while. I could eat this healthy food every week but its been hard to find.  Been there about 5 times now and each time was great.

So the only thing to learn is every Mongolian BBQ place does their sauces differently.  Not very different in flavor, but absolutely in strength.  At one restaurant  you don't want more than a single scoop of flavoring, others like Stir Krazy you want about 3 scoops for a full bowl.  You will know if its a bit strong or weak in flavor once you try it.

For me the house souse (*3) + garlic + the spicy hot + sweet sauce (*2) (more of a cooking wine not really sweet)  is great.   After you get it from the cooks, wait a 2 minutes and flip it over on your plate to allow the meat to reabsorb the sauce (letting cooked meat sit after cooking is an important trick in all cooking).  Then dig in - YUM.

Hope they add another location closer to Henderson where I live, so I can go more often.  My body just loves this fresh healthy food."}
{"text":"All you can eat option is about 15 bucks, one bowl is 10 dollars - pretty good value in my opinion. Ingredients were very fresh, you can mix and match whatever you want and add the sauces at the end. I would recommend adding a bit less than they say on the wall if you don't want it to be as greasy. They give you white or brown rice options, but i usually just had a bunch of noodles with my bowl and it was more than enough. Service was good, i just wish they had the cooking area out in front to make it more special and cover up their sanitation area with a wall. Overall, pretty good all around."}
{"text":"Good food but the fill up bowls come in dif sized. The price is a bit high for what you get and servers there like to wonder off until they see you're done."}
{"text":"Great place for healthy food that won't kill your wallet! The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The appealing part about dinning here is the hundreds of different combinations you can create. Once complete they cook it all up and it is DELICIOUS! Great lunch time deals and all you can eat menu for dinner."}
{"text":"i come here every time I visit Vegas. The price is well worth it. It's $9.99 for lunch and $13.99 for dinner AYCE stir fry.  The ingredients are always very fresh and the kitchen area is open, not cluttered, and very clean.  The way it works is you are given a bowl in which you can fill it up as much as you want with the variety of meats, veggies, and sauces available.  After building your bowl, just hand it to the staff behind the counter and they will cook it for you on the huge grill (which will only take maybe between 3-5 minutes to cook).  Lastly, the staff will ask if you would like a scoop of white or brown rice to enjoy your stir fry with.  The first round, I decided to have the stir fry with the Go Lo Mein noodles.  Second round, I decided to have a scoop of rice instead of the noodles.  Third round, I just had the meat and veggie stir fry without rice or noodles.  In any case, it was delicious.  The sauces are amazing here.  They have something that's sure to suit everyone's own tastes.  The sauces available are fire, hot, pineapple, curry, garlic, sweet, house, soybean oil, and sesame oil.  Mix and match 'um and have fun creating your own unique personalized stir fry flavors!  I personally love the house, garlic, sesame, and soybean oil in my stir fry.  

Next time you plan a trip to Vegas, check this place out if you want great stir fry without putting a big hole in your wallet. The staff is wonderful as well, very friendly.  I always look forward to visiting them whenever in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Friendly Staff, All you can eat, competitive price, excellent food choices, fast stir-fry. 
I go here to get my fix on stir-fry vegetables and proteins!"}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night and ordered 2 AYCE for $14 (Used the $10 LivingSocial valued at $20) Each dinner is 13.99. Total 30.25

- Across from Hard Rock Hotel. 
- Our server, Angela, said that bc we didn't print our LivingSocial, They can't accept it. WTF. After realizing that it was far-fetched, I told her you can just take a picture of the coupon. She agreed. Management fail. 
- Aside from the initial confusion, This MBBQ offers great options! They serve more than the basics. Tofu is a huge plus for me, along with baby carrots. But pizza toppings? HAHA. Whatever floats your boat. 
- Chef can provide you with optional white rice with your meal. I saw one of their employees stir-fry their rice! Looked great, but not a option for customers. HAHA. Worth a shot to ask ;). 
- Food quality was still fresh! Great to know esp if you eat during dinner.
- Like most MBBQ restaurants, they did not give us fried wantons and soup.
- Nice interior design."}
{"text":"This place was overall pretty great in my opinion. The customer service was great and within 5 minutes of stepping inside I was ready to eat my freshly made plate of steamy stir fry, with my cold Dr. Pepper along side it. Loved both the sauces and the beef. I'm not sure if I'm just speaking based off of my new found obsession with Mongolian Grill food but the point is this place is worth giving a shot."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - I had this bookmarked for so long and am happy I was able to finally try it.

The staff was helpful and sweet and explained everything to me (not my first time for mBBQ but each restaurant is different) 

I opt for the $13.99 all you can eat dinner and was able to eat about 3 plates. The sauces available were meh but I was happy they had a curry one. There was fire, pineapple, hot, curry, house, sweet, soybean oil, sesame oil and garlic.

I wouldn't oppose to come back and would definitely do so if I was in the area - hence my 3.5 star rating rounding up, but if we are comparing my first experience with mBBQ and here, I wasn't as impressed with the flavors since it was a bit bland."}
{"text":"Bodybuilding food Mecca, come to bulk after a day of war. 

Had 8 waters and 5 plates for only 13.99; I will provide a shout out after my powerlifting comp."}
{"text":"My family took me out to this place last night. I thought it was great, quiet, nice selection, friendly staff members, and reasonable price. We ate here for dinner. Dinner allows you to have All You Can Eat for about $14 a person. Lunch is about $10 for one bowl. I thought this was a great price.

You start at the bar with meats. Then veggies, nuts, and sauces. Then bring it to the grill to get your food cooked. It only takes a few moments. You can get brown or white rice each time. 

I thought this place was amazing and it is only a few miles of the Vegas strip. I would highly recommend this place for a nice meal with friendly staff members. I would like to visit this place again in the near future."}
{"text":"wow.. .delicous.. great service... YUMMMMM highly recomended.. and to boot.. healthy"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for awhile so when my 7 year old told me that she would treat me to lunch with the money she earned, this place came to mind! 

The prices were super reasonable for lunch and the set up with the food was clean and neat ! It was my daughters first time having Mongolian bbq but she fell in love after the first bite! She also asked for a side of white rice because she will literally eat rice with anything lol. She also told me that when she grows up, she will come here for lunch all the time !! (She is 7) it's safe to say, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Before I continue, this place had amazing customer service. Everyone was very friendly and our waitress was very prompt when it came to refilling our drinks and giving us new bowls. 

We came here for Mother's Day. We saw it while we were driving and I said why not. We really love Genghis Grill, hate their customer service, but enjoy the concept of Mongolian grill. We walked in and was greeted right away. They told us to find our own seating. We sat down and we got our drinks and bowls. We added all the items we wanted. There was a very limited selection when it came to the veggies. The selection for sauces wasn't that great either. They were very quick at cooking our foods, but that led to more problems.

We sat down and noticed our chicken was undercooked. It was still pink! Same thing happened with our next bowl with some pork. The sauce they tell you to add made  the dish so salty it was borderline unbearable. 

All in all this was my first time, but my last. Never again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. I liked that they have fresh ingredients and you can make your plate the way you like it. I definitely will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, glad they are open in our area again. The food is so good, fresh, tasty.  Love Mongolian BBQ. The restaurant is beautiful and comfortable. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Do you want to try your hand at making your own Asian dish but don't want to actually cook or the mess? Stir Krazy is for you!

Soon as you walk in you see the modern decor and the counter with the cooks using a giant hot plate is what I like to call it haha. At stir crazy you can do one trip or get the all you can eat. Since this was my first time and I was super hungry I decided on all you can eat. How stir crazy works is there's the meat station, the veggies station, the sauce station. You can  pick from turkey,chicken,pork, beef. Then from veggies they have greens as well as oranges and pineapple.

First dish I did was turkey loaded with greens and some orange's used the orange chow mein. For sauces I did home,sweet,pineapple and a little soy bean oil. It was the perfect sweetness and I had white rice.

Second dish I did was turkey with all the greens, sausage, pepperoni, orange chow mein and went sweet, spicy. I went easy on the spice since I wasn't sure how I would take it. I think I should have added a little more since it had spice but I would have liked more. I'm glad I didn't do like my friend though and put too much and end up sweating a storm haha!

Tips for making your dishes:
Go easy on the oil. Some people really over do it on the oil.
If you want sweet don't be afraid to add oranges and the pineapple in addition to the sweet and pineapple sauce.
To get the sauce on the meat either put meat then some sauce or when you stack the veggies leave a little hole and when you put the sauce it will sink to the bottom to the bowl.

I give it four stars since it is a unique experience, the food was pretty good, and the service is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I don't see what the hype is about at all.  I am quite picky with restaurant and since stir fry is a favorite of mine I thought I would give it a try.

It's not your typical restaurant. More like a take out Chinese style sit in with about 12 tables. 
Fairly clean and staff seemed nice but the food was just plain and very average. 
The decor doesn't resemble that of a Mongolian grill, more just that Las Vegas theme.

They do not give you many choices to work with as far as food. What choices they did give you all seem to be frozen, not fresh. All the meat and half the veggies were all frozen. 
Lack of sauce choices leave for more improvement. They all seem to be really watered down, and have little to no flavor. You have to use a handful or more of sauce and at that point it is so watery the flavor it does have runs off of the food and onto the plate.
Only flavor comes from honey or sweet chili bottles located on the counter.

Rice is really really dry. Also lacks flavor. 
For the number of stars I was expecting alot better.
Didn't even bother finishing a full plate. Paid, and went elsewhere.  

The person I went with seemed to like it, but agreed it doesn't get 4+ stars.

Probably won't return. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Oh my god! Talk about Awesome! Such an incredible selection of protein, veggies, and other goodies to pick from! Make it how you want it. Then hand your plate to the chef and he cooks it up for you in no time. The process is so fast that you can almost call this a fast food joint. But no, my Yelp universe, it is not a fast food place. Far from it. Stir Krazy food and the people working there make you feel like right at home. I highly recommend them, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"On a mission to try more places near where I now live, I stumbled upon this place thanks to Yelp. Never having been to a Mongolian bbq before, I said, \"Why not!\" 

The place itself is tucked away in a plaza that doesn't have much going on. No wonder I've passed it without realizing it's existence. Anyway, the place is SUPER clean. You can tell they really care about appearances, which is great. 

The people working were also really nice and fast with service, even during dinner rush. After telling them that I had never been there before, the waiter told me what to do and proceeded to take care of the husband and I with quickness and hospitality. The man working the grill was also nice, fast, and efficient. 

I've never been a fan of AYCE to be honest, since usually by the second plate, my stomach decides it wants to kill me, so coming to dinner here was a mistake. All dinner is AYCA and lunch is one bowl. Lunch is good enough for me!

As far as the food goes, I see people saying that there wasn't a lot of variety here, but it seemed like plenty to a Mongolian BBQ noob like myself. The main meats were turkey, pork, chicken, and beef. Chicken all the way, baby!  

As far as food quality goes, it's hard to rate, considering you are the one in charge of making your own food. If you suck at making food choices, it sucks. User error. Of you magically come across a killer combo of mouth explosion flavors, then it's great. 

All and all, it was okay. I feel like it was a wee bit to expensive to come to for dinner if you aren't going to scarf down a lot if food, but the lunch price is typical. Won't go out of my way to eat here again, but it's worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"If I wanted to be a prick, I could ding this place for the stark lack of decor...the black walls and the thrown together look of it all...but in reality, this place kinda rocks.  Our server was great, food was great and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"After hearing Stir Krazy was reopening after closing the Paradise location, we couldn't wait to see the new location open. 

It's pretty much exactly the same restaurant as before, just in a new location. The ambiance does benefit from the new location though; bright inside, but not blinding, like the last location could get. 

They have a great selection of meats and veggies, and everything has always seemed very fresh. If you aren't familiar with this style of restaurant, your server gives you a bowl to take to a buffet to choose your meat, veggies, noodle, and sauce, whatever you want. Then you hand it to the wok attendants, and they cook it up. You pretty much can't go wrong, and I'd say half the fun is trying to stack your bowl as high as you can  - although for $14 for all-you-can-eat, there's really no need to. But when it comes to the $9 lunch bowl, challenge accepted. 

It's a fun place, and we'll probably be regulars here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!!! Everyone is always super nice. You can dine in or make a to go bowl. If you dine in for dinner it's all you can eat. They have a great variety of fresh vegetables you can choose from. Also they give you the option of different meats for you to choose from which includes chicken, beef, turkey, and pork. They have a few different sauces you can choose from for flavoring as well and a ton on noodles. You also will get the choice of white or brown rice or no rice at all. Everything is always cooked to perfection and they have different hot sauces and sweet chili sauces for you to put on top as well! If you go get a rewards card because after 10 stamps your next one is free! It's very inexpensive around $10 a person and it's something quick and healthy!"}
{"text":"We used a restaurant,com coupon to dine a Stir Krazy and loved the all you can eat fresh grilled food. All 3 of us made two trips and mixed up our flavor combinations each time.  That is what we liked best about this place you can mix up your meats and veggies and sauces and have as much or as little of each as you want.  They do have a large menu board that can help you with suggested combinations but variety is the spice of the food here. 
We look forward to coming here again.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Yesterday was my first time eating here and it was very delicious. The food was great. The line to get everything cooked up was long but it was worth the short wait. They did keep on replenishing their ingredients which was nice but they weren't fast enough with the garlic sauce! The price is ok 13.99 for adult dinner and 8.99 for child dinner. Overall I enjoyed the experience and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff. Food was great. Had two plates with great variety.
Made one with sprouts beef and soy sauce amongst other stuff. My next was delicious noodles, ham, pinapple and sweet pinapple sauce and spicy sauce
Id definetly come back. Type in the address manually because waze took me to the wrong address"}
{"text":"Okay, so for those of you who don't know how Mongolian BBQ works, you fill a bowl with meat, veggies, sauce, and noodles of your liking, and then they cook it for you. So, I'll start off by saying I am not a huge fan of Mongolian BBQ, and I came here not of my own choosing. My fiancée had a groupon for this place, so we came to check it out. While I am not a fan of Mongolian BBQ, I have nothing negative to say of this place. The selection of veggies, meats, and sauces were great! Very fresh. They even had tofu and water chestnuts which I love. It's all you can eat, and it's pretty filling stuff! Bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Wonderful and fresh produce and meats coupled with yummy sauces you can mix in any combo you desire.

The service was great and turn around time on the dishes (from handing in your bowl to a completed cooked dish) is extremely fast. At dinner time you get \"all you can eat\", which allows unlimited trips to the fresh bar of raw ingredients. I liked being able to try more than one combo.

Oh...and my husband ate veggies...which is a small miracle."}
{"text":"Very fast, very friendly service.  Excellent food.  Will come back here every time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place! A little thrown off by the whole process the 1st time but man was it worth sticking around. It looks like a salad bar, you can pick whatever you want or follow the recipes on the wall. When you are done building your 'salad', you then build your sauce, most are water based and healthy. After your food and flavors are picked out they throw it on a grill and stir fry it. I'm hooked. So good, such a great idea."}
{"text":"My sister likes this place a lot I'm not that big on Mongolian bbq but I do have to say this place is pretty good so I recommend it"}
{"text":"Finally a real Mongolian BBQ in Vegas/Henderson. Came here the first time and it was awesome ... Great meat, great fresh Vegetables and lots of sauces. I love it ... We missed this type of food here !"}
{"text":"Great selection of ingredients, friendly and courteous staff, but be warned!! You can eat too much!!! I was unbelievably stuffed when I was done!!"}
{"text":"By far the best traditional Mongolian bbq! I'm so happy I found this place! Staff is super friendly and it's always super clean! I honestly would recommend this place all day everyday to everyone!"}
{"text":"So I enjoy places like this.  We went here for lunch and although it was slow we were not greeted at the door and pointed in any direction.  We kind of wandered around and checked out the selection for a minute before someone told us we could sit wherever we liked.  It was $9.99 for lunch which I thought was a little steep for a place like this but it was nice with big booths.  I made myself some broccoli chicken with onions and mushrooms and then used the recipe off the wall to make a mongolian sauce for my stir fry.   The weak point of this place is they don't have a lot of sauces.  I've been to some similar places that have a much better sauce selection.  The people were nice and the food was great though."}
{"text":"Overall I'm very pleased with our experience! I am a huge Mongolian fan and was pretty heartbroken to move to Las Vegas and find there was one place and they had closed. We came in for an early dinner late lunch so it wasn't busy at all. Everything was very clean and everyone was incredibly nice and helpful  the best part was the food was AMAZING. It fulfilled my pregnancy craving I'd had for the last 13 weeks. Only thing I'd say to improve is a little more options and to make the oils more accessible. Being as round as I was I had a hard time reaching them, but then seeing others had an issue as well made me feel better."}
{"text":"Pro-tip? Get your meats and sauce first, then finish it off with noodles and vegetables. Let the sauce marinate the sliced meats. This place was a solid \"good.\"

Service was quick. Clean restaurant. Nice decor. I went during a non-busy lunch hour and was greeted within meetings. You seat yourself. If you're looking for a quick bite and you're in the area, you should stop by Stir Krazy Mongolian Grill.

For $9.99, you get a 24 oz. bowl, which you can fill up with meats, vegetables, orange noodles and a wide variety of sauces. The bean sprouts and mushrooms didn't look too fresh, but the rest of the toppings looked okay. I used 3 scoops of house, 2 scoops of garlic, 2 scoops of sweet and 1 scoop of sesame oil. I skipped the white rice. 

Within minutes, the server cooked my bowl on his grill and transferred it onto a plate once it was finished. They have a lot of Asian condiments (i.e Sriracha, Garlic Chili Sauce, etc) too. I loved my dish! It was flavorful and packed a punch. 

It was a good experience though! Pricing-wise, it is a bit on the steeper end for Mongolian BBQ if you just get one bowl. I'd reccomend the AYCE if you're super hungry! If I'm ever in the area, I'd definitely stop by again! I think I was in and out within 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Not the best Mongolian grill I've been to, but definitely one of the best in the valley since we have limited options.

I like that they have recipe ideas posted on the wall to help you out if you have no idea where to start. They have a good sized selection with a few odd items (like pepperoni and italian sausage). I like that they have a few sauce selections and offer recipes for mixing the sauces as well. The staff are friendly and offer help whether it's your first time there or not. 

Although the bowls seem pretty small, I'm always full after one serving with noodles and rice. The food is pretty good, but it always seems a bit dry which I try to compensate by adding more sauce, but that in turn makes it more salty. The food's pretty good and it's a fun experience."}
