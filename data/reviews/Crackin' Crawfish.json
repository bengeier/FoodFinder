{"text":"Very good food and service. I'm a Louisiana native and this is the closest thing to going back home."}
{"text":"We had 1 lb shrimp, 1 lb crawfish, fish an chips, and the Cajun fries at our dinner here. The fish and chips were pretty good, but the highlight of the meal was definitely the shrimp and crawfish. The fries had a great amount of spice and were super crispy. The crawfish, while slightly small, were very fresh and again, well seasoned. My personal favorite was the shrimp, which were a great size, again very fresh, spicy and delicious. We got the crackin seasoning on the shrimp and the Cali house style on the crawfish. I personally preferred the crackin as I enjoy a good level of spiciest, but the Cali was very flavorful and good for those who aren't big fans of spice. Overall, great place, nice service, and really good quality food for a good price. I would definitely come back if in this area again!"}
{"text":"Great seafood restaurant. Probably the best in Charlotte! I eat here every week and the sauce is the best sauce I've ever tasted. Usually busy during the weekends but worth the wait! Price is reasonable for seafood. Has great specials."}
{"text":"We drove from Fayetteville to eat at this place. Great service and amazing food. Was nice to see the variety of people eating here. If you are familiar with the boiling crab it's pretty similar to that restaurant.   Like the reviews say the crawfish is a little small. But I don't see that as a big deal."}
{"text":"Fresh seafood and amazing flavor!  My friend and I shared a dozen raw oysters and the boiled shrimp, corn, and potatoes in the \"extreme crackin'\" flavoring.  Solid cajun flavor and substantial heat/spice.  The oysters and shrimp were extremely fresh.  Staff were very nice and helpful.  Great experience!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many places like this in several cities and was looking for one in Charlotte.. This one had mediocre reviews but I still decided to try it out and boy, I'm glad I didn't spent a lot here. I got shrimp which was first n foremost half in quantity of what you usually get.. I wonder if they add corn or other side item weight in per lb price. But the most awful thing was the seasoning flavor which (I kid you not) taste like Indian or Pakistani curry ... I mean it was spicy and all but far further away from typical Cajun seasoning you experience in this kinda food place.. All in all, I will likely buy and attempt making it at home rather trying out at crackin fish in future ... YMMV!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! They don't say hello or even thank you! I don't care if your food is good or not I will not go to a business that treats me like crap!!"}
{"text":"The Shrimp Lemon pepper is tha bomb dot COM!!! Definitely come and eat here. It is worth the pay (:"}
{"text":"Crawfish and sauce were delicious, but 11.99/lb for Crawfish is just insane. You can actually buy live, select Louisiana Crawfish online and have them flown in next day and it costs you about $4.50/lb. I enjoyed the food but the price is just insane and not even close to MP."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars but I think after they get fully ramped up they'll make 5.   I'm delighted to see a crawfish place in Charlotte, and in the University area even more. The seafood was very fresh and the sauce we had (Crackin' sauce) on it was delicious with chunks of fresh garlic and spicy, gooey goodness that you just have to lick off your fingers again and again. If you have ever had a Cajun boiling pot (similar to a low country boil) and loved it this is for you. If you don't like eating seafood covered in flavorful sauces with your fingers after it was dumped out on the table.. well.. there's always Red Lobster for you to go to.   They supply bibs, which you can wear if you like, but really a good seafood boil kind of makes you feel like you need a shower afterward - and this definitely fit that description. We had 1 lb. each snow crab (there were no blue or Dungeness available yet, but they are on the menu), crawfish and clams all covered in this wonderfully spicy Crackin' sauce has a nice level of heat, spicy and flavorful without killing your tastebuds. If you like less spice there's the Mellow and if you like more there's the Extremely Crackin'.   I think I will want to try the mellow sauce next, if for no other reason than it is their base sauce and I'd like to see how close it is to the garlic crabs that used to be served at Hole In The Wall Crab Shack, but that will have to wait until they have blue crabs. I'm also looking forward to trying the Korean barbecue, but I have a hard time turning away a good seafood boil so I'm not sure when that will happen."}
{"text":"I love crawfish and I was so disappointed coming here. The crawfish was so small I can barely get any meat out. We also had oyster the size of a quarter. Will I come back? No. I rather go to razzoo's Cajun cafe."}
{"text":"Was thoroughly disappointed. I would give 0 star if I could. If someone spends over $60 worth of purchase, they shouldn't be getting old and DEAD, yes DEAD nasty crawfish. We couldn't even enjoy it and simply had to throw it all away. What a waste of money. Would not recommend this place to ANYONE!!! Should not be feeding people dead crawfish when they paid a good amount of money for it. I'm still angry and I should've brought the bag back and throw it inside the store itself!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Combo #1 with the Cali Special (mild), I like some spice but not too hot, it was too hot for me! But it was very tasty and seasoned just right. I couldn't finish the whole meal. I would have given them 5 stars if 1. They weren't already out of fresh crawfish at 6pm on a Friday night  (the frozen was still good) & 2. If they had a few more nonseafood options for my nonseafood eating friends. The waitress was very friendly. I was surprised that there were only a few customers there but it could be based on location. I will most likely return again but try a different seasoning that may not be so spicy."}
{"text":"I drive all the way from Greensboro just to eat here. It's awesome. I love making my own combo. I usually take the leftovers home and eat it."}
{"text":"We had a nice meal at Crack'n crawfish last night. Servers were disinterested in serving and more interested in talking in the phone and blasting their music over the house PA. The food was OK, not bad just not great, all was cooked to order to the level of spice desired just did not knock us out.   With more attentive servers who were interested in their customers not themselves I would have upped the star rating."}
{"text":"I hate to give only 2 stars because we really need diverse restaurants like this here in Charlotte (especially the university area).  The staff seemed friendly enough but the atmosphere was just very plain.  They still have some things to finish to make it feel like a legitimate restaurant (ie better menus, salt & pepper shakers, plates, alcohol).  Be prepared to eat with your hands and to be extremely messy.  Also, be prepared to pull heads off of shrimp and crawfish and peel your entire meal.  The mild \"cajun\" seemed very spicy - more of kick than a mild cajun spice should have been for my taste.  The Lemon pepper was very good.  Three of us split the combo 1 and were still hungry afterwards - maybe should be split between 2 people instead.  Just to claify, the sausage is 4 small pieces and the potatoes and corn were small as well.  You will need to wash up afterwards.  I have had low country boil and this didn't seem like a close fit.  I will try it again later (getting something different of course) and hopefully they will have worked out the kinks."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at this place several times. We usually get a combo of shrimp, crawfish and crab legs in the Mellow sauce. Even though it was mellow it has some kick to it. It is fantastic low country boil! The best we have had outside of Louisiana! It is messy, but that is to be expected. Just tie on your bib and dig in. Try it once and you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"Wow...we were excited to enjoy some great crawfish. Naturally, we went to a place with Crawfish in the name. Upon arriving there were three empty tables and a totally empty bar but they said it would be a 30 minute wait. We first confirmed that they had crawfish and then sat at the bar. 15 minutes later someone took our order. 25 minutes after that, instead of our food, they let us know they were out of crawfish. I asked why she confirmed they had crawfish and she just shrugged to say sorry.  What a wasted drive and night. We love crawfish but with service like this, I don't think they can or should stay in business. I understand things happen but they literally offers is nothing but a sorry, which I certainly don't accept."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!  Reading the reviews I expected bland and flavorless food but I got the complete opposite!  I would return today but they're closed."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Crawfish Boil with a Vietnamese take, and Charlotte surprisingly lacks in the crawfish boil department in general. So when I saw a picture on instagram about this place even before it opened, I was really looking forward to checking it out. Turned out I was not happy with my experience! The combo A was definitely not 3 pounds! Or they probably weighted the corns and potatoes and sausages in that 3 pounds too because I had the same combo at Boiling Crab and Kicking Crab all the time and definitely had a lot more than what I got here. The crawfish was probably the size of your thumbs, why is that though, we are not that far away from Louisiana! Most of the clams were just empty shells. I asked for substitution (what we always do at BC and KC) but they didn't have that option. The bag needed more sauce for sure as well. All and all I wasn't impressed, and didn't feel like I got my money worth. It is a new establishment so I hope they will get better, but i don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"I had to drive about 2 hrs just to get to this place but I was excited despite it having some of the ratings. With family in the west coast I've been addicted to \"boiling crab\" & \"crab hut.\" So to find this on my trip to Charlotte was exciting. We got there at 530pm on a Saturday and we were a group of 4. There were about 5 other tables seated. Pretty busy but not as busy when we were leaving. Immediately when I got there I already knew what I wanted because I went on there site. Combo 3 which had 1 lb snow crabs 1 lb Clams 1 lb crawfish and 1 lb shrimp. I shared with my wife as usual and ordered it with lemon pepper and mellow sauce. Being asian we had to have it with rice so we could poor some of the sauce onto it. YUM!! 20 minutes later they got out bibs, gloves , bucket and napkin the excitement started kicking in. It took about another 10 minutes for them to bring it out. We threw down. I love going to these places because with us using our hands we sat there and talked all night. No one was on their phone texting or on a social media app it was just talking face to face with people.  We didn't leave till about 7pm and it got busy with groups. But luckily most of us who were in there were about to eat. They had chairs for people to sit while they wait and they also had an outside seating which I thought was pretty cool. They have a bar where could sit at. The wait staff and owner definitely came over to make sure if we needed anything and just talked to us. Found out she was from cali.  This place is definitely still new from what the owner said it opened up in February. From the time we left you could tell this place will be busy. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We always get the combo #3 with lemon pepper and garlic butter flavor. And also mellow for spiciness. Wow!! it was so good."}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure in charlotte! I eat here a few times a week. They can be a bit unorganized when you place an order for pickup. My uncle recently placed an order and not only was it not ready when it should've been. It wasn't even put in. He eventually left without his food. Under normal circumstances that would be the end of me ordering from a restaurant..: but we can't quit this page because the flavor has always been on point."}
{"text":"Everyone that I know was hating on this place so I had to try it out myself! I'm used to home-cooking boils-- this whole *bib on* kinda thing was a new experience. (yes, whenever I went to the West Coast or Texas I never went to a crawfish place!!)  I got one pound of crawfish, one pound of clams and each side item to put in my bag with Crackin' seasoning. It was definitely creole but with a sweet buttery taste which my girls and I enjoyed. The spiciness kept getting kicked up a notch with each bite which is expected. The crawfish, itself, weren't the biggest but I don't think it was minuscule like some people were ranting about. Ps, the fries are BOMB.  I will be back to write another review when the crawfish are bigger. Maybe some things will change but for Charlotte, this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"Definitely will go back.  The reviews told me this was a hit or miss, but it was a hit for me.  I'm from California, been to the Boiling Crab, the Kickin' Crab and a few others that try to do the same thing.  I don't get this stuff often, but Crackin' Crawfish was really good.  I ordered their 1/2 pound combo, which was 1/2 pound snow crab, 1/2 pound of shrimp, corn, potatoes and sausage (I subbed more corn for the sausage), all in their Bayou sauce.  It was so good that I was hungry for more and I ordered a pound of dungeness crab with the same sauce.  I don't know why some reviews said they didn't get the right amount of food.  I got the right amount of snow crab and shrimp, which is probably more than enough for 1 person, but the crab was probably closer to 1 3/4 pounds.  They gave me the whole crab minus the top shell.  The owner told me towards the Spring he has an AYCE crawfish deal.  If I had the patience to peel and eat crawfish, I would definitely do that too."}
{"text":"Cracklin Crawfish was a very delicious meal for the three of us! We had crawfish and shrimp baskets. I had to return and place another order of the shrimp because it was so fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"We went to the Crackin Crawfish today for lunch and ordered the Combo 3:  a lb of crab, lb of clams, lb of shrimp and lb of crawfish. They were out of the crawfish so they substituted shrimp.  There were also two corn cobs, 4 potatoes and a couple of sausages.  We also ordered a side of a lb of mussels.   There was a choice of seasonings and we opted for the \"Crackin\" which was the middle of the line heat index. :). It was very good - perfect blend of spices with a ton of garlic which made me happy!    The seafood was good but I think over cooked. The clams were large but since they were over cooked they were extremely chewy - the same with the mussels. I think this was because our waitress appeared to be the same person preparing the order and she seemed a bit preoccupied with family members or friends. The service got better after a second waitress arrived but by that time we had completed our meal.   The restaurant is very basic with butcher papered tables and a large paper towel holder for your napkins. The food is served in a large bowl and you are given a styrofoam plate and a bib as an accessory to your meal.  Thank God we had the bib...By the end of our meal we had Crackin sauce everywhere!   I probably would return but I would definitely come prepared with my own napkins, baby wipes and maybe some goggles. ;)"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service is less desirable. Prices are a little high for what you get. But not a bad place to get your food on spicy seafood in a bag."}
{"text":"I'm a regular on Sunday's and normally we get Ellie. She is so sweet & treats us SO GOOD. But today's service and food was not to my satisfaction. We were told that our wait would be long with obvious open tables (that had yet to be cleaned). I told the waiter we came from 40 mins away just to eat here and asked if we could sit at one of the tables that weren't cleaned off yet. The waiter (don't know the guys name) was very accommodating and helped us get seated. When we were ordering our food, our waitress, Morgan, didn't have our full attention as there were people walking in and was muttering under her breath \"omg.\" She had a look the entire hour I was there that made it seem like she didn't want to be there. If your job is really that bad, quit. Or, don't take it out on your other tables because of a big party that was there. We always order the combo 1 with medium house special sauce and heads on the shrimp. We weren't asked by Morgan if we wanted the heads on and we didn't realize this until it came out. We also realized that our combo 1 did not come with corn. We let Morgan know this after we finished as there were 5 of us and I didn't want to make a commotion. I'm regretting now that I didn't speak up sooner because all we got was a simple and not sincere \"sorry.\" Not gonna be a regular anymore due to today's service."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. We got two specials (1/2lb of crab legs, 1/2lb shrimp, sausage, corn, potatoes) and it was delicious. Prices are on par with any other seafood place. There isn't a kids menu- so we orders steamed rice and corn for my son. They have fries too- but that's about as far as you'll get with a \"kids menu\" if your kids don't eat seafood. The only reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the service. We were greeted as soon as we came in the door, but took 15 minutes to get drinks and even order. There were only three other tables when we arrived. We had to flag someone down for drink refills and were never checked on. The food is great- but don't expect great service!"}
{"text":"The butterfly shrimp is fantastic. Also, the fries are the perfect crispness. Definitely the place to go around if you want some steamed shellfish"}
{"text":"Meh...I'm cajun and was thinking the crawfish would be boiled in crawfish boil.  But  instead, the spice came from an oil.  The crawfish were tiny, however, they got the job done."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and seasoned well. Staff was nice and attentive. Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I am a CRAWFISH LOVER !!! I go to different cities just to try crawfish. Today I drove 2 hours to check out \"Crackin Crawfish\" !!! I was the first customer of the day so my service was excellent. They had a special buy 4lbs get 1 free!  I ordered  somewhat spicy (crackin spicy) the hottest was hammer !  I would have given them 5 stars but if you order crawfish by the lbs it don't come with corn,sausage, or potatos. Most boil places give you at least something other than crawfish. Overall it was really good. I would recommend this place if you love crawfish !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere... but that was the end of it. Not only was it far from cajun it was all boiled in unseasoned water and the seasoning was thrown on top after the seafood was already boiled. Anyone who has cooked seafood knows that if you don't season what you cook it in then it will taste like water and the metal pot. To say this is not New Orleans style is an understatement. This isn't California style either, this was overpriced and bland... best part was the seasoned fries. Would not eat here again or recommend to anyone with tastebuds who has ever traveled out of NC for food experiences. Do not see this business lasting long... Cajun Queen in Charlotte is a true NOLA experience... went there right after leaving this bad food experience."}
{"text":"Coming from the DC Metro area where we have about a dozen of these that are awesome, Cracking Crawfish was a HUGE disappointment.  1. The Shrimp were $12.99/lb but I could have gone to any supermarket and bought shrimp 3 times the size for that price. They were so tiny I could eat 3 and 4 at time.  2. I got 1 lb of shrimp and there was no potato, corn or sausage. I had to pay $.75 extra for EACH. They are only included when you buy 3lbs or more. 3. I got the Cali House Special and Medium and it tasted like Tomato Soup with a hint of garlic. Very bland, no spice at all.   4. My husband had the lemon pepper and crackin wings. They were tiny and EXTREMELY salty!  5. The customer service was really good and the waiter was very attentive. That was the best part of the experience. The place was totally empty while we ate there. A few group of people did come in but left for whatever reasons. We should have left too. I do not recommend this place and definitely won't be back unless they make major changes."}
{"text":"The service here is great and our server made us feel very comfortable.  The food is okay and i have had better. But I will add that it's a little bit of a twist from the usual crab shacks. Their food is Vietnamese oriented, kind of like a fusion thing. I ordered 2 pound snow crab Legs, muscles, and clams and blew through in 30 minutes. I will add that I didn't think the bag was really 2 pounds but I don't know. Id be willing to give them another go."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I'm from Southern California where there is an abundance of Cajun restaurants everywhere you go. So moving from there to North Carolina, my food options in general have narrowed down a lot. My boyfriend found this place on Yelp so we decided to try it. I was already a bit iffy with 3.5 stars but figured why not try it.   Upon entering the restaurant, it was completely dead. We were the only two customers that dined in at about 6:00 PM on a Saturday night. And there were only two servers, so management must know that business isn't that great to only schedule two servers on the floor on a weekend night.   We ordered two appetizers of Cajun fries and calamari with a side of lemon fries. Personally, I prefer really thin fries so these were a bit too thick for my liking, but the flavor was there. They weren't bad. But our calamari dish probably had a little more than 10 pieces in there in a decent sized basket. That was disappointing, especially since the calamari was pretty tasty.   The real disappointment was the actual seafood bag. We ordered combo #1 as our main entree with the Cali house special. It tasted soooo watered down. It was so bland! I ate maybe 4 pieces of seafood and I was done and continued on with my fries lol.   Service wasn't bad. That was probably the only thing about 5 stars about this place. Our server was friendly. He checked up on us a couple times throughout our meal.   With that all being said, I definitely will not be returning. I'll just wait until I visit California to get my Cajun cravings fulfilled."}
{"text":"Been wanting to eat here for a year and finally made it!  Unfortunately, not as great of an experience as desired.  Staff was very helpful and nice, but food was just OK.  We had one of the dishes where you pick your choices - we chose 3 lbs of shrimp, with the accompanying potatoes, corn and sausages.  As others have mentioned, potatoes were slightly undercooked, but corn was fine.  As someone who grew up eating boiled shrimp every week, I personally think our dish was a little light - not a full 3 lbs.  All being said, glad I got to eat there finally, but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service is always super slow. You can tell they are extremely understaffed but those who are working are literally running around the restaurant trying to deal with the patrons.   Tonight. My husband and I came for crawfish, a Valentine's tradition. Upon walking in, we were told it would be a half hour wait unless we sat at the bar. We decided to sit up there, thinking we would get faster service. 15 minutes later, someone came by to ask us about drinks. We deliberately asked \"you still have crawfish, right?\" And our waitress told us they did. We placed an order for five pounds and waited. And waited. And waited. 25 minutes later, she came back to us and explained they were out of crawfish. We had been there 40 minutes and had nothing but water. She said she was sorry but offered no consolation, no \"please come back for a pound on the house\", no nothing. That sucked.   The only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is because I have been here before for lunch and it was decent. Bottom line - call first to make sure they have what you want, then ask twice, then still come hella early."}
{"text":"I took an out of town friend to this place and she had a great time! Its a very unique experience ( you get down and dirty with bibs, sauces, lemons, etc) and also quite fun!  As far as the food goes, we got the combo with their  special sauce and it it was perfection!  We had crawfish ( i think they are too much work for too little meat), crab/clam and of course sausage/corn/potatoes. I like that there are other options( e.g. Rice plates etc) if youre not up for peeling crawfish or other seafood items."}
{"text":"Michelle and the entire staff each of the two times I have been here were nothing short of excellent, not to mention the food. I'm a born and raised man from Southern Louisiana and I have to say, although the style is different, the flavor is almost spot on with what I would boil myself. I hope that everyone gives them a chance to work out some kinks as they most certainly will but with a product that can satisfy a seafood snob such as myself, I suggest that you give it a try. And for those who are wanting to complain that the crawfish are too small right now, the season won't be in full swing until at least mid march to early april so be patient and order the snow crab for now. It's now my favorite place to eat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Finally found a great place to have crawfish here. We had crawfish, shrimp, mussels, and clams. They all tasted quite fresh and delicious. Will definitely visit again! Ps, medium is quite spicy!"}
{"text":"My wife has been wanting to visit this restaurant so I took her for Mother's Day I wasn't too impressed when you walk in the door there's no one to greet you and you don't know whether to just take a seat or wait to be seated the menu is somewhat confusing and not too many options there's no kids menu at all $4 for an order of french fries WOW we wanted to eat there however in good conscience we could eat there knowing that our 2 year old son wouldn't have anything other than French fries to eat so we left before ordering anything I'm looking forward to going back and I keep trying the food this time I'll get a babysitter first"}
{"text":"Man I went in there and fell in love. I stumbled across it following my husband to Shane rib shack. I couldn't let it pass me by. The host was super cool. The food was marvelous all for $20. I locked myself in my room and went to town. It was the best. Everything was just perfect and the owner is very inviting. I recommend this place of business any day. I'm on my way there now"}
{"text":"I understand the name now the sauce is like crack. I was soaking everything up with it. Dipping my shrimp, and potatoes in it. I want them to bottle it up. I think it can go on everything. I got the mild flavor. Hair in a ponytail because of my much needed bib."}
{"text":"Here in California, we have tons of these cajun/crawfish places everywhere which are usually packed.  I've never had it from Louisiana but the restaurants make it pretty good here, so we wanted to see how it was in the South.  BF and I was in Charlotte for business and saw this place when we went to the wine store next door earlier in the week.  We got here for an early dinner and was seated immediately.  There was only 2 other parties eating at the time.  We ordered 2 pounds of garlic butter shrimp, spice level \"Crackin\" (medium).  We also ordered rice and cajun fries.  Food ended up being OK, although the Cajun Fries were on point.  Rice seemed overcooked and the shrimp and sauce was not as good as it is at home.  Is the seafood in Charlotte even fresh?  Service was nice though.  Our waitress tolerated me (nicely) when I asked to split the check so I could cover a portion with my travel card.   Not sure if I'd come back if I were ever back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time over the weekend. Though I'm pretty sure our server was new, he wasn't very knowledgeable of a lot of basic things. I was asking him the differences of the sauces and all of us at the table were confused by his explanations. The people I was with have been there before so I went by their opinions of which sauce to get. I ended up getting 1 lb of shrimp - house special, medium. I'm a fan of spicy foods but their medium was way hotter than expected, my mouth was on fire. I added 1 corn and 1 potato... for $.50 I only got half of a very small red potato, I thought it'd at least be a full potato. Also, I believe they don't think people go to the supermarket, because I know what  a pound of shrimp looks like and that wasn't it. For their prices it ridiculous they short people of food. Food overall wasn't bad though, I'd return if I was meeting friends and that's where they wanted to go but it's nowhere I'd pick myself."}
{"text":"I haven't had such a disappointing restaurant experience in years. The server was friendly but clueless. I got to sit and watch my friend eat as his food came out a while before mine...I guess the cook doesn't understand syncing cook times? Then while my crawfish was tasty, I was sick the whole next day! Yikes...ALL of my friend's food was disgusting. He ordered two dishes. Even the fries were bad. And the sweet tea was sour. Lesson learned. Never again."}
{"text":"Finally a decent crawfish joint in Charlotte!! Good food, nice atmosphere and conveniently located in the university area. Of course they just opened and they got a few things to work out in terms of service and food. But overall I had a great experience, the spiciness needs to be upped more I think. Besides that, it's good and the price is right... Though not sure if 75 cents for a little sausage was worth it, but for the kind of food they serve, it's good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before. I'll have to say their different kind of flavors are really good for the crawfishes. My favorite would be the extreme crackin for sure. I'm pretty sure their broth is already seasoned and to throw more seasoning on top afterward does make it really delicious. People who says this isn't exactly New Orleans style, but then again we are in NC and how many fresh seafood restaurant are like this in Charlotte? But I do suggest add more entrées to the menu for instance and spice it up. The menu looks a bit bland and not enough options to choose from."}
{"text":"I've been here once and it was a pretty fun and nice experience. Food was pretty tasty. I only wish it was cheaper. But definitely a nice place to try for the first time or a special date out."}
{"text":"First off from coming to a major city to a little city.. This has the be the best next thing clt has to offer. Uhm.. Okay? Awkward environment I would have to say. The place is well lit up like we are sitting in class at Sunday school, no music. There are however? Huge TV's that isn't turned on. The Decor is decent. Okay okay okay. Let's Get to the topic! The crawfish on grand opening weekend was whack!! Little bitty ity insects. I was ashamed and embarrassed being the fact I was born in Baton Rouge. They served the fetus of crawfish. Sad sad sad... To add insult to being a foodie diner on the grand opening weekend they advertised Beer on the website menu.. Did not happen.. I had to drink water eating little fetus crawfish. Who drinks water when eating crawfish let alone baby crawfish!? Wow.. So I attempted to come back a second time.. (The GF) made me.. Same thing no beer due no no license at the time. And baby crawfish was still being served. Will I come back?! Yes if Walmart runs out of frozen crawfish in the aisle n it was the last resort..  It is the last resort it's charlotte FML.."}
{"text":"I ordered the Combo 1 (Crawfish, 1lb Shrimp, 1lb Clam). The sauce was amazing. It is spicy, which is what I like. I think it can be adjusted if it is not what you like. The seafood was good. My only quip is that the shrimp is not peeled so you will need to work at your food."}
{"text":"New CrawFish place in NC just open!!!!Food is very tasting and service is excellent !! Finally a good place to eat!!! :) I recommend this place  all my family and friends to come and enjoy."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was a huge disappointment. I went there with my brother and dad craving some raw seafood, especially oysters. According to their website, they \"promise some of the freshest seafood in Charlotte\" and that it will be \"kept alive until cooked and served.\" However, despite being in season, no oysters were available, so we ordered fried calamari and butterfly shrimp to start. The calamari looked liked onion rings and were obviously frozen, the shrimp was clearly frozen as well and had not been butterflied or even hand-breaded. I've seen and eaten better product in the frozen seafood section of the grocery store. Despite our being the only patrons in the restaurant this evening, we had to go to the counter to get silverware, sweetner for tea, even salt and pepper... we ordered 2 lbs of King Crab legs at market price for $22 per lb., all of which was steamed and presented in a big plastic bag (seriously?!)  To make matters worse, the cluster of \"King\" crab legs were no larger than your average Snow crab legs. The clams also served in the plastic bag were tough to eat... Overall, it was an incredibly frustrating and horrifically disappointing experience for a $103 check."}
{"text":"Definitely try this place! Went for lunch as I work near by and enjoyed it. Wouldn't have tried had a co-worker not forced me to but I'll be going back. I even ventured out and tried the crawfish. While there's not a lot of meat on them, they are delicious. I'm pretty grossed out by cracking into stuff but it wasn't bad. Go for it! Corn on the cob was the best by far!! Lots of sauces to choose from to have your delicacies cooked in. Check this place out."}
{"text":"For Charlotte, this is a nice new edition to the seafood restaurant scene. I love crawfish and seafood in general so when this place opened up I was super excited. All I can say is \"YUM!\"   The Good:  -The sauce they use is amazing. It is gooey, thick, slightly sweet, with a hit of spice. -The seafood tastes fresh.  -I ate there 20 minutes before closing and the staff stayed 30 minutes past closing to accommodate my friends and I. Talk about customer service, most businesses would give you the awkward evil eye or refuse to serve you. Love them for doing that for us!  The Bad: -My fiance ordered the Korean BBQ plate and it was lacking in both flavor and portion. They give you scrawny pieces of meat but a huge mound of rice. Do not order that!  Overall, I love this place because I can eat good in a relaxed environment. If sauce splashes here and there, no problem you have a bib! lol....Reminds me of summer seafood boils I would have with my family in the backyard. Beer and seafood, bare bones kinda place.... :)"}
{"text":"YES! Crackin Crawfish has finally perfected their Sauce! If I could get it on a consistent basis I'd give them 5 stars! I'm from Cali and one of my favorite restaurants is The Boiling Crab and I promise you Crackin Crawfish 1lb of crab will get you right! I don't like their sausage so I stick with corn and the potatoes but Their House Sauce in Crackin is everything and tastes jusssst like The Boling Crab if not better! I was impressed and can't wait to go back!  Update: September 2017  No longer my fav restaurant. Their seafood, specifically their snow crab wasn't cleaned at all. Bright green yuckiness on all of the clusters. Completely disgusting and too expensive to gamble with another order. I reached out to the owner as I was disappointed I had to trash an underweight 2lbs of crab but no luck!   Horrible customer service along with a horrible order!"}
{"text":"Been to this place since opening a total of 5 times because there's always someone I know that would like to go try it out. Let's just say, haven't craved crawfish since and didn't care for them anymore   1st time: flavor was good! It was grand opening, was super excited to have a crawfish place here. However, crawfish were the size of my pinkie. Seriously pissed me off they had the guts to serve it and didn't even warn or tell their customers. Not really sure why they decided to have a grand opening when crawfish weren't even in season yet. However the flavor was good so I'll wait to come back again.   2nd time: flavor was still on point, garlicky and spicy just the way I like it. Crawfish however were still on the small size.  3rd time: Server seems new and lost. Didn't bring out our foods unless we asked for it or questioned when is it coming? It was frozen crawfish served to us this time and it was actually not bad.   4th time: flavor was off. It's all greasy and powdery. It's like they're starting a new twist and trying out new things with their sauces. Left hungry and went to Pho Real to fulfill my empty stomach. Like every visit.   5th time: MAJOR disappointment. Flavor was whacked!  More like no flavors at all! Super bland and powdery, no garlic or buttery taste. Crawfish were still small. And what the heck is this cheap pink sausages they decided to try as a cheaper option? Tasted like crap and was super irritated at this place. And that's the last time I've been there. Haven't even cared to come here and I'm the type that crave for crawfishes all the time. Plus it's too far away of a drive. They need to step up their game if they want to stay in business in Charlotte. Stop changing recipes and sauces flavors. Learn to welcome people when they come into the restaurant and please turn on some music would ya? Everytime I come there it's like crickets noises. Super awkward to eat.  6th time: Finally! Live crawfish and decent flavorings! It was good, I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Nice seafood spot. I'm glad these are finally finding their way to NC! They're all over the place on the West Coast. This place is clean. We went on a Saturday afternoon. I was a little surprised that there was only one girl there working the shift.  But she was on top of things. We had the combo special #2..crab, crawfish, shrimp. A pound each with corn and sausage. $58 for the bag. Sauce was excellent! I wish they had the garlic noodles like the ones out West do. But  the food was good. I will go back. Note: They're only set up to handle about 1 or 2 large parties at a time during peak times."}
{"text":"This place was great! The food was amazing. We order two combo #2, hot and medium. It fed our family of 4 and we had leftovers. We love spicy food but the hot flavor was extreme. The waitress was very kind and patient. She gave us the rundown on the menu and gave us great suggestions. We will definitely go many times. The only con is they were short staffed. There was only one waitress working. But she did amazing. She worked her bum off. I just wish she had more help. This is in my top 5 best seafood restaurants."}
{"text":"I like this place they are first crawfish in Charlotte!. The favour is great love the spice and the crawfish and shrimp Extra crakin is my.favorite!!!. Yes the price maybe high but COME.ON IS SEAFOOD!! And they do need some kind of profit. We need to support Our Local Businesses here in the Carolina and not the Chang's restaurant!."}
{"text":"We actually demolished the food before we could take a picture but it was really good. I've been to a lot of crab bucket places in Hawaii so i wanted to let my uncle and aunt try it. they really enjoyed it and was surprised to how new this was to them (haha old). The worker even ask my uncle if i convinced them to come there  you will not be disappointed. The sauce was Great! We got 2 combos 1/2 of shrimp and crab, chicken wings, Cajun fries, and buttery shrimp."}
{"text":"Market price food with excellent service. The Cajun fries are great. Try the crackin flavor on your seafood but \"medium\" is really hot and spicy here! I'm not sure why the average was so low."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went there after a friend recommended the place to us. It was about average overall. It wasn't up to Cajun country standards but if you have that craving and you can't get to New Orleans this place will tie you over until you can get there."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Whenever I'm craving seafood this is always my go to. We usually get combo 3 with an extra pound of crawfish and the flavor we get is the \"extreme Crackin\" idk what it is today but it was exxxxxtra spicy. We loved it but had to take the rest home. My daughter got the butterfly shrimp and Cajun fries. The Cajun was a dollar extra."}
{"text":"I found this place right across tea fusions. I was very hesitant about going to this place because it looked like a ghost town inside compared to Shane's rib shack during the  lunch time, but decided to try it anyway. It was a nice, calm place. The restaurant itself is a decent size. (The server was kind , accommodating and wasn't bothered by my 1 year old messing with her apron) we ordered the combo #2 $45 for 1 pound of crawfish, 1 pound shrimp, 1 pound clams, and 1 pound mussels. You're allowed to switch out the seafoods for something you would like instead. The wait was about 20 minutes. Once I finally ate some, I was wondering why some tasted flavorless (y'all I forgot to shake the bag!) but after realizing my mistake, I was very shocked at how much flavor was sitting at the bottom of that bag! the spice was just enough to where it didn't burn your mouth, but still gave the heat.  Now we get to the cons of this place: I thought the potatoes were a little too under cooked, the corn was too dry and the place didn't have a place I could change my baby. Other than those cons, I do plan on going back. Definitely enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Crawfish was ok, nothing like back home in Louisiana. Maybe should try different  seasoning, it's to sweet."}
{"text":"I used to love this place! But I won't return until they bring back the buy 1 lb of snow crab, get a lb half off special. Very disappointing for myself and all of my friends/family members I've taken here to enjoy seafood at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Delicious and friendly.  I like the low country boil.  After some experimentation we have found getting the crayfish and the sausage in the boil makes the flavors change pretty significantly.  The last time we got just the crab and it was not as tasty, got a pound of the crayfish to go and it was great.  We'll probably stick with the shrimp, clam and crayfish boil as it seems to be the best for flavor and value.  The staff is always very friendly and accommodating.  Really sweet with kids too.  Bring your own crayons and the kids can draw on the butcher paper while they wait."}
{"text":"My hubby and I visited the \"crackin\" for the first time on a Friday night.  It was my birthday.  We ordered the combo number 3. We subbed out rice for potatoes with no problem!!. The food was...good. This issue we had was with the crawfish. We knew we are not in season. (That is springtime) but we were hoping for some good frozen or farmed replacements.   The other items in our combo were VERY GOOD!! I liked that you were given the option to have the shrimp cooked with the heads on!  The crab legs were excellent and the spice mixture they use to season is awsome but be forewarned...mellow is still SPICY.  We did complain about the crawfish and were given a discount that we appreciated.  The service was good but could be a problem if it was much busier. We would definetly return for the crab legs and when the crawdads are IN SEASON!! BOTTOM LINE IT WAS MESSY BUT A FUN BIRTHDAY, THANKS CRACKIN!!!"}
{"text":"It's not that great. We got the Korean bbq plate, snow crab legs, mussels and two lbs of crawfish, mellow and crackin. There was just so much gooey seasoning that I couldn't really taste the food underneath. The Korean bbq was really good though.   Everything is given to you in a bag and you just make a mess all over the table with the shells, which was a little unappealing to me. The seasoning was just a gooey, slimy mess dumped over everything, crackin wasn't very spicy, and mellow was pretty bland. I wish I had just gotten everything plain. I'm actually contemplating going home and rinsing all my leftovers off.   Anyway, our waitress was a really sweet girl, but I don't feel like she actually knew how to be a waitress. I also felt a little uneasy as the owner stood behind the bar watching me throughout the entire meal as if I were stealing something.   In all, I don't think I will come back again, and if I do, I will be sure to order everything plain."}
{"text":"Not a do over and we had great expectations-drove here for a fun Fathers Day lunch crawfish, shrimp.clam mussel-sausage,corn pot for two  was $48. Not fresh!!  The rest of the menu was fried food so no cole slaw or anything else on the menu that was not artery clogging."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice but the food just...doesn't take like anything. The sauce doesn't have much flavor other than spicy. Overall it looks much better than it tastes... We went there because the boiling crab place we like closed down recently :( this place definitely didn't live up to our expectation. Probably won't go back..."}
{"text":"Got the combination and the crackin flavor was perfect. Everything tasted great and can't wait to try again. The only issue we had was the shrimp seemed to be over cooked and were hard to peel, and the crawfish were small and hardly any meat whichmade them hard to peel too."}
{"text":"Their sauce had a lot of flavor. But I was really disappointed. My first time and never again. We order the $50-60 pack, I believe the 3rd one? Wanted extra sausages... And didn't get it. Paid extra for it and didn't get it... OKAY. Then our corn was missing also, didn't even get that with our order. We didn't even get a pound of shrimp at all also. We pretty much got ripped off. We only got 7-8 shrimps, no more than 10 crawfishes and the crab legs, was nowhere near one pound."}
{"text":"Went here two times, first time was ok, pretty good- but not great.  The second time was the deal breaker.  I understand that ordering fresh crawfish is a hit or miss, but it was EXTREMELY bad inventory.. the crawfish was literally as small as the size of a nickel! the problem with this is, the owner(s)/management didn't even address it to their customers. They could at least warn us, before we made such a huge order, or given us some kind of discount because it was worse than buffet crawfish; and we would have totally understand and would have been ok with the whole situation. Losing some money on bad batches of crawfish is more beneficial than losing businesses from potential returning customers that was there that day, and trust me all of the customers in the restaurant seemed extremely dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Tried this new spot out tonight. They are clearly very new and still working things out.   Tried to order a beer when i sat down but they do not have their license yet.  Bummer.   Service was very friendly and prompt.  Helpful in explaining the menu choices and how the various combinations worked. Over all i found the service very good. Example:  i ordered a half dozen raw oysters to start. They brought a dozen. When i pointed out the error, i was immediately offered the choice of keeping the order as delivered at the price for only what i ordered. Very pleasant and accommodating about it. And the oysters were very good too. Would have loved a beer with them though.   For my entree i ordered a whole lobster in the Crackin' sauce with corn on the cob and roasted potatoes. The lobster is priced by the pound and comes from a live tank. I was impressed that the server came and told me the lobster selected weighted 1.25 pounds and the total price. She confirmed my acceptance of this and confirmed this with the kitchen before they cooked it.   The lobster, corn, and potatoes were served all together in a plastic bag with the sauce.  I had never been to a restaurant that served like this but i was told this is the Cajun style. So i went with the flow. Everything was piping hot and cooked to perfection. But what a mess. Shells and sauce flying all over. Good thing i accepted the offered bib!  But to be honest, kind of fun. Dig in and go for it!  The Crackin sauce was delish.   In summary, all the food was terrific and the service was great. Nice people that really seem to be trying for a success. I think they will reach that goal. I would have given more stars but the lack of beer is a no-no for me. Especially with this type of food. But that will be fixed soon and i know i will be back. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the crawfish in mellow spice and lemon pepper for the shrimp, perfect spice for each item. I really enjoy the sausages and corn, where it marinates in the sauce which makes it more tastier! The décor is well fitted since if is a seafood restaurant. Service is great, food is great, has a great atmosphere while serving seafood since it's uncommon to find a seafood place in the central part of North Carolina. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Coming from Maryland where seafood = life, I try not to expect too much here in Charlotte (no offense guys). We ordered some snow crab legs to go in the flavor of Extremely Crackin (the one right before the hottest) and it def. had our noses running (people who love spicy food know what I mean lol) BUT the sauce was kind sweet also? Super confused but nonetheless we ate them all my friends. For about $30 we received 4lbs which was like a snack to us but did what it was supposed to do. For the record you cannot combine flavors, I asked for garlic AND spicy basically and they pretty much said \"No\". Make sure to ask for butter as they do not just give it to you which I thought was like crabs 101 but I guess not. I will say that we called in out order about 45 minutes before they closed (not paying attention to the time), and they were ore than delightful in completing our order and even called (either out of courtesy or out of wanting o get the hell out of there and go home) to make sure I was one my way and knew where to go.  I probably won't return anytime soon as I prefer to continue my search for great seafood in Charlotte BUT if I so happen to fail, I would try this place once more."}
