{"text":"Horrible! I pointed at the $8.99 General Tao with included drink. The guy asked me what drink I wanted I say Pepsi, then he asks me what soup so I say sweet and sour ( I'm thinking all this is included ) then he charges me $19. I say hey I just want the special but he pretends not to understand. Then he says it's already been charged and he can't reverse it. Then he gets mad. Then they hand me back $8 and I say I gave you a $50. There was no-one else there so I'm pretty sure he was trying to rip me off. And he's stone walling me. Anyway after lots more arguing he charges me $3 tax on a $9 dollar meal. No included drink and its the blandest overcooked crap I've ever had. I can't believe crooks like this can exist. Where are the negative stars??"}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I would. Everything was stale. Prices were insane. Charged me $4 for a bottle of Pepsi. Garbage food."}
{"text":"I thought I would be getting decent Chinese food like the tiki-Ming in the Champlain mall, but boy was I wrong.   General tao chicken was awful, like it had been sitting there overnight, and when I complained he offered me the shanghai chicken instead which was a mild improvement.   The rice was dry, the spring roll was disgusting.  Never eating at this location again.   Gross."}
