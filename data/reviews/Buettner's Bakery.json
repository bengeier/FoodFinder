{"text":"Great old world bakery full of fresh yumstrosities. Nice selection, no $5 cupcakes here. Everything very reasonable - dozen donuts $8, all super fresh and awesome.  Opens early (like 6 am?). Got hooked by walking my dog past in the morning and smelling freshly baked heaven. I knew it had to be good from the smell, and the fact that  stream of people come through even that early.  Donuts, fritters & croissants are all yum. Even the pizza bagel was light, fluffy and well done. Haven't gotten through the entire bakery - might not make it thru the door if I do. Don't miss it if you are bringing stuff for the office or party or whatever. Prices & quality can't be beat.  Be warned, CASH ONLY! first time i went in, i had to leave drooling :("}
{"text":"Their Pizza Bagels are delicious!!!!! Have to try one, they are full of flavor, cheese, and very soft! Hits the spot! yum.."}
{"text":"I simply could not do a review of this place and give them any less than a 5 star rating. Their variety is incredible. The smells and ohhh the tastes!  This place is beyond incredible!  Put it on your bucket list. Donuts, pastries, pies, cookies, breads, pizza, etc...  Love Love Love this little gem in Euclid Ohio!!!"}
{"text":"Old world bakery for sure! Fresh, delicious danish.  But, watch out for the witchy clerk behind the counter, you won't be coming back on account of her non affable style!"}
{"text":"Just got back from a donut tour in nyc and buettners still is the best for a classic donut! Love the donuts and pizza bagels here! Great price!"}
{"text":"If you want delicious, sweet, affordable baked goods (and who doesn't??), get to Buettner's."}
{"text":"This neighborhood bakery is just AWESOME!  Small bakeries like this are few and far between.  I stop here on my way to work, on occasion, and pick up goodies as a treat for my co-workers.  Everything is always fresh, delicious and inexpensive.  I can't believe how reasonable the prices are.  I always leave a little extra, because they truly don't charge enough, especially when I think about $8 desserts that I've had at restaurants, that pale in comparison to the fresh baked goodies here.  I'll continue to frequent Buettners!"}
{"text":"Nice little local bakery. Does not look like much from the outside, but once you're inside there is a huge variety of breakfast pastries and fresh made donuts. Everything looks delicious - I imagine they have amazing paczkis."}
{"text":"This place is the best Bakery just awesome selection pastries I am from Poland and this remind me of being back home closest I've found to there definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Great prices, great desserts and pizza. Come for the treats (and low prices), stay for the pictures of Elvis everywhere!"}
{"text":"I went here in at around 2pm and no one customer other than myself were their.  Although I was in and out, the person working seemed bothered by the fact that I stopped in to support a small local business. The cherry pastry that I got wasn't bad and the price was low, but again the turn off for me was the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bakery with plenty of standards (delicious doughnuts, danish, kuchens, bread) but also the best pizza bagels for miles and wonderful cakes.  Like most small bakeries they are busiest early in the day and some things sell out quickly.  Prices are very reasonable and the staff is super!  The cranky counter person mentioned in some earlier reviews is long gone.  Preorders recommended if you absolutely must have an item but won't be there early."}
{"text":"Five stars for the pizza bagels and for making them just as good as they were 20+ yrs ago."}
{"text":"Buettner's doughnuts are the best in the Cleveland area at very good price.   I have tried the pizza bagels which are very good, the pizza is good if you are looking for a snack of cold pizza, I was.  Chocolate chip cookies!! I pick up a dozen almost weekly for myself  and I take them to Michigan when I visit my people as they love the cookies and always request I bring a dozen for them.    Five stars for product deliciousness and freshness."}
