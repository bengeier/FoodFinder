{"text":"Best pork sovlakie I ever had and my friends loved their burgers. Also saw two Metro Toronto police officer having take-out so you know the food is good."}
{"text":"Was there with my colleagues for lunch today.   Its a cute place to be in that's for sure.  I ordered mamas signature burger which was more than enough for me.  It was very tasty and juicy.  I would definitely bring my niece and nephew hear when I babysit them next Saturday. The portions were huge.  I could not even eat the entire burger.  Guess I will save it for dinner.  My only peeve was that it took a while for us to get served which was probably typical for lunch."}
{"text":"What a great find! We recently moved into the neighbourhood and were delighted to find a good burger place.  The food was delicious, we had the burgers and fries, and the staff was very nice.  There was a slight delay on our burgers and we were offered a free dessert.  We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Very good value. Always stuffed when I leave. I have only had the burgers.. I will have to try some other menu choices. Clean washroom and seating area. Condiments look fresh and clean ."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. You can tell they've been around forever, and they know their demographic pretty well. The spicy feta is pretty delicious, but it sucks that you have to pay extra for it."}
{"text":"Went there once before and found the burgers to be pretty good if underseasoned. Went back today and the staff seemed to be rushing and somewhat flustered. I stood at the counter for almost ten minutes and it was as if I was made out of glass... not one word, no one even looked at me!

I ended up walking out without ordering...perplexed at the staff's behavior. I wont be returning for a 3 rd try, sorry mama, but I didnt feel like I was part of the family. 
Try greeting your customers, especially if they've been standing there for a while!"}
{"text":"The owner get his fresh produce from my store so I know he has amazing product. Went in the other day to check it out, had an amazing burger. I can eat and the size of it nearly finished me. So bring your A game! And some friend's! Everything was made to order and cooked to perfection. Can't say enough good things about this place. Going back today, they have made me a customer for life."}
{"text":"I stopped in earlier this week to try this place out and boy am I glad that I did. I was served by mama, a very nice lady who took the time to explain what was on the menu as well as the key points of a few dishes. She truly showed that they care about her customers.  I decided on getting the mamas double signature burger (with bacon, cheese and caramelized onions), fries and gray. 

The burger was delicious. It is easiest the juiciest burger I have had in a very long time. (I'm glad I had plenty of napkins.) It was cooked perfectly. You can tell the grind their own meat by how fresh it was.  

The fries were a golden brown. Looked like the had just changed the oil in the fryer.  

There is a little bit of a wait but that is because everything is cook to order. If you don't like that you need to go back to crap the fast food guys sell. 

They have a large sign that reads \"Fresh food not fast food\" and they are living up to that motto."}
{"text":"I just tried it for the first time after hearing many good things.
I came in around midnight and it was pretty empty. It got busy as I was leaving though.

Food is pretty good, I will almost certainly be back at some point.
It's a very small dining area, but they've done a good job of squeezing in seats.

I had a double 4oz burger with poutine and a drink for $12.70 including tax.

Also of note: While they do take Visa, and Debit, no Mastercard - I didn't care, but you might."}
{"text":"They are soooo nice and their burgers are soooo good, I usually get the american single which is cheap for only 3.99$ and its huge for a girl like me ! Yum."}
{"text":"Gotta eat here. ..fresh fresh fresh. ..as the sign says fresh food not fast food\" tell everybody you know about this place. ....simple fresh and friendly family business\""}
{"text":"Good service . I like the pork souvlaki dinner roast potatoes and rice is my favorite."}
{"text":"Pretty much a regular here... Amazing, happy staff! Very courteous and welcoming.. 
Food is very fresh and always a pleasure to come here.
Chicken souvlaki pita, my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"Just dont get you mama lovers. 

Went twice now.  First time waited an eternity for meh. 
Ok second chance - waited another eternity for apparently \"quality\" with my six year old boy.

Well. Disappointed again. How does an overcooked tasteless burg (dry) oh yeah it was carbonized torched on the outside. What are you guys all exited about?

I usually dont get so fired up about reviews, but please this burger house is far over rated.  POOR.  Sorry.

Poor

Wouldn't recommend anyone."}
{"text":"Delicious gyro with the best bread I've had, impeccable service and cheap prices. I have no suggestions because this place does everything right. 

I will definitely be going back for the tzatziki alone!"}
{"text":"I've read the other reviews and find many of them funny.   They're not fast-food, no, that's because it takes a long time to turn your burger into meatloaf.  The second-worst burger that I have ever eaten.  Waaaaaay over-priced, to be sure.  The only reason that it's worth going there is to have an example in your mind of what a horrible, dried-out, over-cooked piece of meatloaf on a stale bun tastes like .  I actually took the patty off of the bun and ate it like meatloaf.  Poured ketchup all over it and it wasn't bad, FOR  MEATLOAF.   The cost was worth it because my girlfriend and I are still using the joke \"meatloaf\" when we talk about eating out.  \"what do you feel like eating?\"  \"How about picking up some meatloaf on a bun?\"   Then we laugh and laugh.  It's been a month and we're still getting mileage out of it.  I asked for bacon and got one piece, folded over.  The fries?  So under-cooked, that they were like mashed potatoes in my mouth.  The tomatoes were like dark-red mush.  My girlfriend fell over when she saw them.  She picked them off with a spoon, not a fork.  The only thing they got right was the cold pop from the fridge...which I got myself.  The service wasn't rude, just indifferent: no smile, but no attitude, either, just \"'can I help you?  The burger takes a long time because it's fresh food, not fast food.\" The guy cooking it was in the back, no word of a lie, sitting down, for like ten minutes.
   Absolutely terrible on every level.  as I said, I would recommend it if you want an example of a terrible burger, otherwise, stay home and make meatloaf; it's cheaper, and, most likely, more satisfying.  I don't understand why I can't give a review with zero stars.  I call it a zero."}
{"text":"Used to come here daily. New staff making food really bad and poor service!! Employees need better training to ensure quality food and services"}
{"text":"Checked out this place based on a friends suggestion and it was as good as she said.  Diner style and very busy for a Friday lunch in the burbs.  We both had the combo and fries were really good but only got about 15 fries, I wasn't super hungry so it was fine but I will mention the next time.   Staff were all super friendly and very proud of their award for best Burger Joint voted by Yelp and BlogTo.   The most important part is the burger and it was good however I still personally prefer Burger Priest. (Better bun to meat ratio). Lol    Will be back to Mamas again to try other dishes soon."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork poutine last night, it was amazing.
The size was massive for the price. My husband and I have been searching for a place close to home that served pulled pork poutine for a few years since our other favourite place closed down without notice. Mamas is definitely THE BEST pulled pork poutine in the east end I will be returning here again, I look forward to trying the delicious chicken souvlaki next time :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic juicy burger, delicious homemade fries and a super-friendly owner who spends time talking to you and making sure you were satisfied?  What more could you ask for?

Oh, the owner also gave us free deserts to try out before we left."}
{"text":"Driving past, intrigued so went in. Two of us shared the mama special and a poutine. The burger meat was a little dry but the sauces helped make the burger more enjoyable. The gravy for the poutine was amazing buy skimpy on the cheese curds. We don't regret coming here but probably won't return. We didn't get the same experience of meeting mama or having the different burgers explained to us. Service was still nice but nothing unexpected."}
{"text":"Amazing burger and fries. Would definitely come back. Would love to try some of the Greek food as well! The service was friendly and the food was absolutely fresh. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dropped in based on a search for highest rated, one dollar sign. 

Oh it was a nice big burger alright. It was one dollar sign. Mama was very friendly and encouraged me to have the American Signature burger (2x 4oz patties, bacon, cheese, caramelized onions) and oh boy! Mama knows me well. It was a great no nonsense hamburger. Much better than a gourmet burger...or Burger's Priest (etc, etc)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service and great food. I have tried their poutine and chicken and pork Slovaki wraps and it was all delicious. The food tasted fresh the meat, all the toppings, and the sauces. They give a good sized portion of food and the prices are reasonable. My family and I we always order for pick up and they have our food ready everytime we get there, usually 10 minutes. We enjoy it so much we always make the effort to go atleast once a week :)"}
{"text":"This place serves up great burgers and fries -- the greek fries are awesome but make sure to bring your appetite! I am looking forward to coming back here to try their souvlaki. Service is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and steaks on a kaiser. Gyro on a pita is by far the best in town. Mama is always there and offers plenty of fun conversations while you wait."}
{"text":"Great food. Burger is decent and ranks up there with all the other locals. 
But the real deal is the souvalki and sandwhiches. 
Absolutley lovely. 
Great prices and as everyone is stating in the review, amazing service. Always nice. 
Oops I almost forgot MAKE SURE you try the milk shake!!! 
Sweet, frosty and thick that you need to use those muscles to drink it down. So good. 
Don't delay and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Mama was not here! Mama's boy was though.  Very friendly dude.  After eating he explained some of the differences in burgers.  Advised everything is fresh with the exception of frozen hot dogs, onion rings and something else I can't remember. My friend forgot to order a drink and wanted to buy one but he gave it to her for free.   Offered to try some dessert as well but we were full already.  

***Disclaimer:   I was full already when I came here to eat so my review may not be as accurate as it could be.  I had two fries, a shamrock shake, a coke, Big Mac, mcchicken and a couple of chicken mcnuggets before coming here.

I ordered a single with bacon and cheese. Which is a 4oz patty cooked on the flat top.  My friends ordered mamas signature which is a 6oz patty which is cooked on the grill.  I should've ordered this instead! Don't be a wimp like me! My burger was good made with fresh meat, and soft bun. Toppings are the standard lettuce, pickles, onions, hot peppers, tomatoes, relish, ketchup, mayo and mustard.  The burger was good, but it would've been better if I ordered the 6oz.   I'll try the signature next time.   Had fries as well. Fresh thick cut fries.  You need to order their gravy to go with it.  It's good! I tried the gravy from my friend's poutine.  I will be back to try other things and re-review."}
{"text":"Chicken Souvlaki is really good, but unless you are able to eat a disgustingly massive amount of food or are sharing, get the smaller size dinner. It's a beautiful meal, but sadly they add this pathetic little stale role with it. Ask them for pita bread instead and they will grill it for you and it is a million times better than that sad, hockey puck of a roll they usually give you. 

Calling ahead is a great idea. This place gets really busy at dinnertime and they are NOT a fast food joint. They take their sweet time and don't care if you stand there huffing, puffing and sighing and looking pissed off. Seriously, if you don't want to wait up to 20+ minutes for your food, even just burgers, call ahead and then pick it up. You will save yourself a lot of irritation that way. It's also a small space with a few tables so when there are a bunch of take out order people standing around waiting, it gets crowded and loud. 

The burgers are good, fries are great, but the poutine is seriously lacking in cheese curds. They need a little lesson in how to make a proper poutine. But, the divine chicken souvlaki more than makes up for any shortcomings this place has. It's better than anything I've had on The Danforth. Bonus...free parking in a real parking lot!"}
{"text":"On the plus side, we thought the food at Mama's Boys was pretty good, a better than average burger with generous and well-cooked sides.  We went once and have never gone back.

The reason?  The ridiculous, lost-our-order-and-wouldn't-cop-to-it, 1 hour we waited for our burgers.  The restaurant was busy and understaffed when we arrived, and the guy taking the orders mentioned it might take 10-15 minutes to get our food.  So we waited, and waited, and waited.  

And then we noticed that people with the same order as us (cheeseburgers and fries) were being served before us, even though they had placed orders after us.  When the 8th group left ahead of us, I asked the cooks why and they told me that they don't cook in the order that the tickets come in(?).  At this point, there were no burgers even on the grill.  Well over an hour after we ordered the burgers, our order was ready, with no apology but an old muffin for the long wait time.

We wanted to support a locally owned business, but can't get over that experience.  We go to the Five Guys that's 10 minutes away, and that's about how long we wait for burgers as good as Mama's Boys."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - Love the store front, funky and fun little place. Well lit,  staff, fits small groups - whole restaurant maybe 20 people. 

$10.50 - Gyros Dinner (recommend). Can just get the wrap in pita ($5.50 - very value). Cucumber was very fresh. The meat was very fresh. The tomatoes was also very fresh. 

$6.65 - mama's single (recommend)
Total $12 with a poutine as my side. 

Combo for $2.50 (cup of fries and drink), +$1.50 for poutine/Greek fries/salad/onion rings

She called me \"honey\", made me feel special even though I know she says it to everyone but I secretly know she only meant it to me."}
{"text":"Good burgers, starchy fries, amazing customer service, will go back, want to try souvlaki"}
{"text":"Tried the fries again and they are great, gravy is awesome too. Update to 5 star!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time with family that was here visiting from California. The service from the owner was great and the food was awesome! My son went to the counter to order a shake and the owner refused to let us pay for it and wouldn't accept a tip either! We had burgers and the souvlaki salad and everything was amazing! We will definitely be coming back. Hands down the best burger in the GTA!"}
{"text":"Great quality food prepared thoughtfully. A bit more premium priced but paying for quality which makes this a standout place compared to all other \"diner\" style joints in the area. Staff is friendly and accommodating. This is where I am happy to spend my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Mama's Boys Burgers. If you want a great hamburger, this is your place.  You want great food, this is also your place. Open most nights until 11pm, Friday and Saturday open until 3am. But they do much more than just burgers. There is nothing on the menu that isn't great. From the steak dinner that has the best roasted lemon potatoes that frankly no Greek restaurant can beat, as well as perfectly cooked rice and an awesome fresh Greek salad. To steak on bun, gyros on a pita or sausage on bun. I have had practical everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed once.  

The family that runs this place is Greek, and Mama (yes there is a Mama) makes certain that the chefs meet up to the standard of care and cooking only people who have had grandmothers cook for them know.

The staff are friendly, efficient and stand out amongst all the various staff I encounter with all the regular places I frequently. This is my first review, only because I think people need to know about this place.   I go out of my way to drive past a half dozen places for their food."}
{"text":"It was right across from my middle school and for only $5,you got a burger, fries and a pop. It's definitely worth the price and the food is also really good. The customer service is good, almost everything is good about it. One of the best lunch stops to head off to."}
{"text":"Best Fries in town!
Tasted so fresh, so crisp! 
I'm coming back to try more food later on!"}
{"text":"Mama's Boys Burgers is absolutely fantastic! Their chicken souvlaki on a pita is by far the best I have ever had. I don't know what kind of tzatziki sauce they use, but it's incredible. The fries are also some of the best fries I've had at a burger place in Toronto. The prices are quite reasonable and the portion sizes are very good. Although it can sometimes take a while to get the food, I know it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday.

Pros:
- Old school diner ambiance
- Lots of seating

Cons:
- Pricey for the quantity offered.
- Ok tasting food"}
{"text":"- Food is great 
- Staff are friendly
- Place is neat and clean
- The fries are a most try 
- Fresh ingredients 
 In other words is a bang for your buck !"}
{"text":"What a nice addition to the neighbourhood, came here just before the rush came in and ordered 3 slouvaki dinners & a 4oz burger combo for my parents & brothers to go. 

The staff was very welcoming and courteous as they offered free gravy to my brothers combo & also insisted we take a couple of free drinks w/ our dinners which I thought was very generous!!

As I got home my brother raved about how delicious the burgers were & agreed to be coming back as a regular. I enjoyed my meal & my tummy was fully satisfied indeed. I got to try my brothers fries & as a person following a strict diet, I couldn't help but indulge into my brothers fries as they were too hard to resist.

5 stars all the way! 1st star for the friendly staff, 2nd star is for the generosity in accommodating free drinks & gravy, 3rd star for the fresh food, 4th star is for the fast & efficient service, 5th star for being just located across from our home LOL"}
{"text":"Friendly service, gives you a very home like feeling! 
Freshly made food, love the steak sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Great local burger/greek joint. They make yummy fresh burgers, fresh cut fries/poutine, souvlaki and salads. Great fries, good serving sizes, juicy food. They also sell desserts made offsite so not special but ok if you need a sweet hit. They have a sign up that says: \"We don't make fast food. We make fresh food!\" And it's true it's not fast which is the biggest issue with this place - they move a little slow and aren't the most organized sometimes. Overall is they could speed it up a bit and they made amazing homemade desserts would be their areas for improvement. 4 Stars! Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"There is no way this place has a high rating like this. 6 months ago 60 reviews to 17? i heard you can contact yelp and get rid of the bad reviews on here. Let's be honest Scartown doesn't really have much to choose from in terms of local gems. This place compared to Dans,Mccoys,Preist is a joke. Very overrated. Better then Johny's tho lol"}
{"text":"It was a last minute decision to come here and I'm glad we did.

I had the gyro dinner. It was fresh, everything was really good. The tzatziki was delicious. My plate was full, portion was huge. My husband ordered the hot hamburger w/ poutine. He loved it and can't wait to go back. 

After we finished dinner the nice lady (I'm guessing Mama) offered my 3 yr old complimentary ice cream and a toy. I thought that was awesome. 

$23 for 2 meals and 2 drinks!! 

The flow of customers was steady, lots of people ordering out as it was dinner time. C"}
{"text":"Great portions, great service, great quality. Never disappointed when I come. Wait time can be long but it's worth it for the quality and love put into each item.  Best food in the area easily"}
{"text":"It's always great to see Mama behind the counter. When I come in with a big group of friends, she usually gives us free brownies or baklava. It's like she's the Greek grandma I never had! The burgers are excellent and prices are good. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"So Mama's Boys Burgers is somewhat of a staple in southern Scarborough close to buff, while the place has really only been open for 5 years now. I know I had assume it been there forever but reading into, there use to be a portugril here in the spot up untill early 2011. Some of that decor I think still exist which include the Mama Boy Mural  inside and some the tiles and table Which I dont mind as much. If i didnt read it I wont know.

The the I can comment on is table placement, it a small joint and they seem to be just packing in what they can so this place has limited seating. Maybe 4 or 5 tables and a counter by the window but most of their food is take out, Even the owner who is sweet lady at cash most of time, recommend if you get food or takeout, calling in is a good idea. I have to get before a crowd of construction workers other wise i would been waiting

This place is more value and large portion then quality, which isnt bad, it not best tasting burger i had but it was still juicy,  i had mama double which two 6 ounce patties for just over 10 dollar. It not bad, and it filling. But there was nothing to special about it or nothing terrible. Which why it get an overall 3, service could use some work

So with that, it a good cheap, home burger which is filling, what more can you ask for. I will be back to try the souvlaki since it a greek owned place so that has to be good. For now John is out"}
{"text":"Came here after getting tired of all the overly fancy, excessive-topping-encrusted burgers usually found around downtown - I was feeling like something basic and old school and Mama'a Boys didn't disappoint. This is easily one of the best burgers in the city that I've had recently. As mentioned, the burgers are no frills - you really only get the usual lettuce tomatoes ketchup etc, but honestly that's all you need. The patty itself was fantastic, thick, juicy with a slightly crunchy crust. Tasted fresh and retro. 

The Greek fries that came with the burger were great as well, with a healthy amount of feta cheese and olive oil as toppings. I got a milkshake, which was also quite good - freshly cut strawberries and bananas, and a nice creamy texture.

Highly recommended if you're looking for some excellent, old-fashioned burgers in a no-frills setting and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Just a regular burger joint. Don't have crazy high expectations. Decent."}
{"text":"Up front disclaimer...apparently I know the owner!

Midway through my experience here, I'm dressing my burger order, when Mama looks at me and says, you look so familiar...Well, it's only been 20 years or so, but Bessie & I worked together waaay back when at Obie's Family Restaurant.

She's come a long way from Obies I can tell you.

1.  Everything's fresh, fresh, fresh!  The meat the produce, the feta, the fries...everything!  My wife & I shared a burger and a pork souvlaki.  They were both good, but go with the burger.  Also, get the fries...soft, sweet, skin-on -- beautiful (take it from a potato-aficionado...self-proclaimed, but my wife completely agrees that I know potatoes)

2.  The service is really special.  Yes, we sat down and reminisced, caught up, etc...but I couldn't help noticing every single customer calls Bessie by her name, or \"Mama\".  I actually heard a family say to her, \"We just feel like family here\". To which she replied, \"You are!\"

3.  A great deal.  We got the souvlaki combo (w/ fries & a can of soda) + the burger for $16 all in.  Oh yeah, we upgraded the fries to a poutine as well at that cost....definitely cheaper than 5 Guys around the corner, heck that's cheaper than McDonalds.  If you make small talk, Mama will probably start throwing in extras as well.  Like a good Greek Mama, she'll keep pushing food at you until you give at least three \"No-thank-you's\" and a \"Seriously, I can't\".  And it wasn't just me, because she was doing it to just about everyone in the place.

Just a nice place to get a burger where the owners just want to see a smile on your face.

p.s. my wife couldn't stop eating the baklava Bessie threw in as we were chatting.  When she had some problems cutting it with a fork, she just picked it up with her hands and started shoving it , like a boss, into her mouth."}
{"text":"This Burger & Greek spot is one of my favourite places in Scarborough, Ontario. On Fridays and Saturdays, they are open relatively late for those late night cravings. Definitely a family environment, as seen through the staff. They are always welcoming and provide great suggestions for first timers! Always pleased with the service and quality + quantity of food! Must try: Pulled Pork Poutine, Greek Fries and Mama's Burger!"}
{"text":"Very old school, backyard bbq type hamburger, but very delicious.

I had the mama's signature and it was huge and messy, but tasted great. The service was super friendly. I would go back if I'm in the area and wanting a burger.

4 stars!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic neighbourhood restaurant.  Mama is absolutely lovely, and the staff are super.  I'll definitely be back to sample other items.  Been twice and had the pork souvlaki both times.  Food was fresh and definitely not prefab.  Pork is a bit on the dry side, but otherwise good.  On the first visit tzatziki came with the meal.  I saw just as I was picking up my order the second time that there was a sign saying it doesn't come with the meal.  Had to do without and it didn't help that the pork was dry.  I'm a bit confused between the two orders, which were in fairly close timing of each other.  On the first, I was asked if I wanted rice OR potatoes.  For the second order I was told that both come with the meal.  I know this review sounds a bit negative, but I enjoyed the food apart from these glitches, and will definitely return for more of Mama's food."}
{"text":"The place is cute kind of small, you get to see your food being made in front of you. Atmosphere feels old school but had a great home vibe to it. The staff were friendly and my friends and I got to meet the legendary Mama herself (such a sweet kind lady). My friends and I ordered: 

Mama's signature Burger: 2x 6oz patties with caramelized onions, cheese and bacon with fries, 

The American Signature Burger: 2x 4oz patties with caramelized onions, cheese and bacon with onion rings and 

The American Single: 1x 4oz patty with fries. 

Pretty good portions for the price. Fries got soggy after a while but that's typical but they were delicious and crispy when we got them. The beef patties made were juicy and seasoned nicely. It was juicy till the last bite! Toppings and condiments were pretty standard the usual. But the fact that my beefy patty was cooked perfectly, seasoned well and was juicy made me more than satisfied. I'm pretty glad we tried this place out. So if your ever in the Scarbs area hit this place up!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger. If you like a good tasting meat, check this place out. Good value for price point and all the favourite meals available. Definitely worth the stop in."}
{"text":"fresh, rich, filling, juuuuuuicy burgers"}
{"text":"In Toronto for a few days and am always excited to try new places when we're here. Found this spot via Yelp, as we needed a place to lunch while my car was being fixed a few blocks away. Saw the great reviews and decided to give it a whirl. We were greeted pleasantly by one of the women behind the counter when we entered. We placed our order at the counter, then found a table to sit. There are a few tables (estimating less than 10) plus bar/stool seating at window. We ordered burgers -- when they were done, we were called back up to the counter to pick out our fixings. They had quite an array to choose from: sliced tomatoes, lettuce, onion, pickles, and several others, along with ketchup, mustard, their house sauce and chipotle sauce. The chef came over to me while we were picking out our fixings and said he didn't realize there were 3 burgers in our order and only put two on at the time. To put a third would have taken another 10 minutes, but he said he already had two 4 oz patties that would soon be ready, and he could put them together to make a double 8 oz burger, instead of the 6 oz I ordered. Who could turn that down? Nice improv, dude! While we were waiting for our food, I noticed every single table in the place had a plate full of fries with feta cheese crumbled on top. My heart jumped for joy: for years, any time I'd order a gyro at a diner with a Greek salad and fries, I'd immediately transfer the feta from the salad to the fries. Heaven! I always thought people were judging my weird combo when I did that -- but glad to see my brethren up north enjoy it so much it's on a menu somewhere!

Was definitely blown away by whatever their \"proprietary mix\" of ground meat is -- it was a robust flavor I have never tasted in a burger before. I'm not sure I'd want every burger to taste this way, but it was definitely a nice deviation from a standard burger. Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am sure that everyone has their option on who sells the best burger in Toronto. However, for me Mama's is definitely on my top three list. 

What I like the most about this place is the love and care that goes into each order. Some of my favorite choices are of course the burger with fries, the steak on a kisser bun, and the souvlaki dinner. There is really no wrong choice in my opinion as all the items on the menu are very good, if you have not been here I recommend you make a visit! 

The staff are supper friendly and if you come early enough you may get a chance to have your order taken by Mama herself, she is such a nice lady and always happy to serve the customers. It won't be long until I am back."}
{"text":"Wow! I was in the area for work and decided to look for a local joint for lunch...found Mama's Boys Burger and I don't regret it.
 Had a Mama's Double for lunch, it's a amazing. Great flavours and not  bland like many of the true beef burgers I often find in the niche boutique burger joints. Friendly staff and great food, I will be back"}
{"text":"Really really good burgers ! 
Ordered steak on a kaiser , came out ..nothing fancy , just simple steak and I could taste really fresh meat ! . I guess simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. 
Gyro sandwiches are pretty decent too ! 
Good staff and good service !"}
{"text":"This place is a little difficult to get to. A bit out of the way in a quiet area I wasn't expecting to find a legit burger joint. But Mama's Boys Burgers know how to make a great quality burger. Good price and big burgers. The fries weren't anything to rave about but one of the better burger joints in the city."}
{"text":"Stopped there for lunch today. Tried the Mama's signature with two paddies and bacon. The burger was fantastic! Juicy and flavorful. Definitely one the best I've had in a while. The prices were also very reasonable. Wasn't the biggest fan of the fries (only tried the regular fries). The place itself is ok. Just a normal, a bit rundown, burger joint. 

Food: 4.5/5 (0.5 point for the fries) 
Price: 5/5
Atmosphere and service: 4.5/5
Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I can't believe the 4 and a half stars!! I WAS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED WITH THE BURGER!! The best thing was the lettuce! Please if you are thinking about going to this establishment just stay at home! Negative 2 stars in my book.."}
{"text":"Got the mama burger and Greek fries, it was awesome and the service was very friendly"}
{"text":"A combination of super juicy, tender, cooked to perfection chicken souvlaki on top of fresh Greek salad dressed and carresed in feta cheese gives it the perfect combo for making your dream meal come true ! Burgers and stakes are also an option for you if you're in mama's spot ! They offer burgers in various options and stakes that's cooked the way you want !"}
{"text":"It was my hubby's bday and where does he want me to take him? Mama's Boys Burgers! My hubby is a no nonsense guy; all he wants is a thick, juicy well seasoned burger that's reasonably priced. 

He always orders Mama's Signature Burger with two 6oz freshly ground burgers with cheddar cheese, bacon and caramelized onions. He added lettuce, tomato and the chipotle mayo (sauce is to die for, we used it on our regular fries too). My go to order is the Steak cooked medium on a Kaiser bun with grilled onions and mushrooms. I added tomato slices and lettuce on mine. Both sandwiches were juicy, tender and flavorful. My steak sandwich was so tender that I could cut it with a plastic knife. 

When we were almost done, I was thinking it would be nice to meet Mama. I look towards the door and who comes walking in? The great lady herself: Mama! I excitedly told her that my hubby insisted that we eat at her restaurant for his birthday. She enthusiastically wished him a happy birthday, hugged him then turned around and kissed me on both cheeks! She then went to the refrigerated case, pulled out a \"lemon mousse\" dessert and gave it to my hubby as a gift. What a sweetheart! Now I will say that the workers are nice and helpful but Mama is the epitome of hospitality. 

This is our regular joint for delicious burgers and steak sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've come here a bunch of times with my friends and each time we're always very satisfied. The burgers are very filling and the poutine is really big so it's guaranteed you'll leave feeling full. The milkshakes are also very nice and refreshing too.

The reason I'm rating this place only 3 stars is because it's not the best burger place in Toronto. I've definitely had better poutine, burgers and milkshakes before but this place is convenient and does the trick when I'm craving more than just McDonalds poutine. If you're in the area, check this place out. The people are very friendly and it's got a really homey environment."}
{"text":"One the best burgers in Toronto, had a great experience there with its lovely owner and super friendly stuff, feels like you eat with your family.
Highly recommended to all the burger lovers!
Cheers to Mama"}
{"text":"Fresh burger and steak on the kaiser is awesome for the price. Poutine is good too!! Cozy spot and prices are awesome would come here again. Friendly staff. Follow @aaron_eats_ for more places to eat and hidden gems across the city!"}
{"text":"Got there with great hopes. Dry, over cooked patties and pulled pork poutine floating in acidic bbq sauce."}
{"text":"Fresh juicy burgers, and great service! What else can you ask for? Their poutine and onion rings are a must try and my hubby swears their strawberry milkshakes are one of the best he has had.  They serve some leaner meal choices as well but go there for the burgers which easily rivals the Burger's priest and other on trend places right now. Oh and they also have a wide choice of condiments like chipotle mayo which many other ma and pa joints don't carry."}
{"text":"The boys stole Mama's recipe or so I thought, then she appeared from the kitchen. Wow, the homemade burgers keep all the naturally juicy goodness without all the grease. The homemade fries are killer, but go with the Poutine if you want to experience Real and Fresh cheese curds.

Nice to see this local family serving its community."}
{"text":"Great prices fresh burgers and fries, you can choose your burger and make it a combo (cup of fries and pop) for $2.49 extra!
Lots of topping options, even if you don't go for additional signature toppings (bacon, cheese), caramelized onions are free!"}
{"text":"Doesn't get much better than Mama's.

Thanks to Lambert P. for posting the best burgers slideshow.  First one listed was Mama's boy.. just take a look and see why I had to go.

If looking search for \"TO Burger porn - a slideshow\" in food.

I ordered a Mama's double, mistakenly thinking due to the prices that their single burgers would be a child size which seems to have become the norm for many newer places where you need to order a double to get a decent size burger.  I was wrong, it was massive, it was nicely cooked, it was juicy... I couldn't finish it, I finished it anyway.

The fries?  I love fries in general and a place that serves really good fries will often bring me back to a place with meh burgers.  Happy to say Mama's fries are a match for the burgers.  Great fries.

Small place from the outside, but plenty of seating, including a few picnic tables outside.  Nothing special with the decor, but good feel to the place.

And the service matched everything else, this place will be seeing more of me."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend and let me just say mama is the sweetest! I had asked her how much a bottle of water cost and she said we could take it for free :) Anyways kind of regret  getting a poutine just because there were a lot of other stuff I wanted to try. I mean don't get me wrong the poutine was delicious but poutine is poutine.  Food was also really inexpensive for the amount that we got so I was very satisfied. Definitely would come here again and do recommend anyone to come here when in the area :)"}
{"text":"Great service such nice staff and tastes good. :) You can choose ingredients for the burger and it's great. I call to pre-order so no wait (otherwise place can be busy depending on the time of day)."}
{"text":"Good food, mama is a great customer service owner, always order from here, if there's an issue she always makes it right. Thanks for the great food."}
{"text":"By far one of the best spots in Scarborough. The best pork souvlaki I have ever had, bun, pita, dinner it doesn't matter. The burgers are great, but messy, so be ready for a great-messy burger. Fries are good, the people working there are some of the nicest people I've met."}
{"text":"Some legit burgers. 
The mamas burger was well proportioned and juicy.
Fresh or frozen, not seasoned heavy.. almost as plain as a ground beef burger should taste.

Y'know you're getting a sizeable burger when when the last bites are 60% burger. 

Unlike other Greek diners with the crack like fries (crack used in a positive connotation)
They change it up with the thicker fries, like chips of any Fish N Chips.
Y'should get the point, the fries are thicker!!  
** Note, if you take out w/ fries they will lose crispness and start to get soggy. BUT, these Fries/Chips are meant for longevity and remind me of old Kentucky Fried Chicken French fries before they moved to crispy fries**

Good to see a next generation Greek diner run by.. well.. the next generation."}
{"text":"Cute little place near the Scarborough Bluffs. Neighbordhood isnt the best but the food is amazing! I dont think i've eaten better feta cheese in my life. The greek salad and greek fries were just perfect and very tasty!
If you have never been to the place, make sure you get to see \"mama\", the sweetest lady around :)"}
{"text":"Indeed my predictions about this place are correct... I have been back numerous times and have loved my burgers everytime I went. Fresh and juicy, made to order and just like they claim....\"not Fast food but Fresh food\". You can tell the difference right down to the maple smoked bacon cooked crisp and delicious!

I will be back over and over again to this wonderful little buger place with a fantastic atmosphere and friendly staff"}
{"text":"You will never be disappointed at Mama's!!!  It is beyond compare. I refuse to eat another burger and I tell everyone I know about this place. Took some visitors from the US here and our group of 15 were all thrilled!"}
{"text":"My partner and I found this place this year and have been hitting up the joint at least once every other week. The burgers here are juicy and flavourful. The fries are awesome too and go really well with the burgers. We both always get the double patty. My favourite is the American burger, while my partner's favourite is the Mama's burger. I prefer the American, it's super juicy and it's what a fresh classic burger should taste like. The folks that work here are chill, I've never had rude service here. When Mama is around, she'll make rounds asking customers if they enjoyed there meals, super nice. There was one occasion I got my burger on a different bun though, I'm used to the bun with sesame seeds on top which I think has a better flavour, texture and brings out the burger really well - I didn't think the bun would make such a difference but it did. It's now become I our go-to place for our cheat-meal. Portions are great, quality is great and affordable. Our friends have had the chicken souvlaki dinner too, and think the roasted potatoes are super flavourful. Out door seating too!"}
{"text":"Love it great food !  Great service ! Meat and cheese really have a fresh flavor. Salad is also fresh I usually hate rice and I finished it all that's how much good it was I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great burger. Amazing taste. I ordered one burger 1st but before finishing it ordered the 2nd one! Deffinatly recomend it"}
{"text":"Best burger in Scarborough hands down.. better than harrys drive in, better than Johnnys, better than real McCoys and better than five guys!!!!  The meat is fresh never frozen and always juicy.

My boyfriend and I went on Friday and loved it so much we went back again on Saturday lol im all burgered out now. But honestly best burger ever.

Staff are great and friendly and the owner is so nice. I asked for a small ice cream and when I was about to pay for it he said no problem dont even worry about it. They care about their customers which is rare nowadays. 

Love this place and we will be back and we will recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"One of southwest Scarborough's best hidden secrets. Mama's Boys Burgers serves a hybrid of Greek and American cuisine with an emphasis on the \"fresh\" aspect of their meals. All entrees on the menu are prepared right before you by a friendly cook who claims that he \"can grill anything you want\". Prices are very reasonable as you can purchase a full combo for under $10. In addition to their famous burgers, they make excellent souvlaki sticks and pitas as well as a mouth-watering Greek salad.

Best part of Mama's Boys is that they are open until 3am Friday and Saturday nights which means if you make back to the suburbs from downtown early one of those nights, you can get your late night Greek fix without having to wait in line at Messini's. Highly recommended for anyone wanting quality Greek and American food at a price that's right!"}
{"text":"Still coming here strong bring my friends & family. Came here with a coworker today had there famous burger & fries. Recommend this place to anybody who loves home cook meals & affordable prices."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner with the Greek. 

The place is Greek owned (fairly obvious by the Greek-mini flags all over). They do burgers, poutine, steak sandwiches and souvlaki and gyro pitas.

We grabbed a chicken souvlaki pita and a steak on a kaiser. Meat is cooked fresh so you have to wait 10 mins to get your food or so. Toppings are all fresh. 

Service was friendly. 

Open until 3am on Friday and Saturday nights, so it's a good pit stop for late night food."}
{"text":"This is the go to spot if you want FRESH, delicious food and AMAZING service. The chicken souvlaki was juicy, just the right amount of char, salad was refreshing, fresh and the home made potatoes were out of this world! We didn't try the burgers or Greek fries but our friends tell us it's delicious. We'll definitely be back for those. The restaurant's decoration was really appealing too- made the Greek dining experience more authentic. Mama herself was incredibly hospitable and kind- we really appreciated how she took the time to take care of us when we dined in. It was our second time visiting in the last two weeks and we plan on coming back for more! The free parking is also a bonus as there's a huge space."}
{"text":"Great quality Greek, burgers, and poutine in the area! Chef was rushing a little but dang, portions were big!  This might be my new go-to fast Greek food!"}
{"text":"Patty gets prepared as the order goes in. Tastes great! One of the juiciest i've had. Size of one patty is 3 times thicker than ones from McDonalds. Fresh veggie toppings. Great price. Friendly service. Cozy atmosphere. This is my go-to place after bluffers. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I stopped in here the other evening after work and was so glad I did. It's a burger joint, with a Greek touch. The menu is simple but plentiful: burgers, pulled pork, chicken pita wraps, poutine, fries. Counter service is homey, and they bring the food right to the table if you eat in. The chicken pita wrap I got was juicy, flavorful and a good portion. I got the combo so it came with a large box of fries, (also really good) and a soda. I don't do red meat, but my neighbor has had their burgers and says they're out of this world. Don't expect a rush on your order, it takes a few, but it is worth it. Oh, and the place is immaculately clean."}
{"text":"So I ended up going here just about a half an hour ago I usually call ahead because a lot of the times it takes forever but this time I just decided to stop it. All  the lights were on open signs flashing as I approached and made my turn into the parking lot I parked right in front and walked in smelling the food still grilling on the charcoal grill. 

A girl rudely stops me and informed me that they're closed and I said in disbelief it doesn't look like you're closed considering there's food still cooking and all your open signs were flashing inviting me in she continued to be rude and insisted that they were closed and there was nothing they could do. 

This is a shame considering the fact that I live in the neighborhood and I would come here at least twice a month to feed my family of 5 needless to say I was very very disappointed had to go to T Bones lol. I felt really disrespected because I know if mama's boy or momma were actually there would have never turned me away and told me they're closed especially when food was still cooking on the grill and the cleanup process hadn't even begun SMFH!!!"}
{"text":"Greek Fries to die for!!!! Everythings good, very good service.......did I mention the Greek Fries????? Heres my advice; Run!!! don't walk!!! 

I'm big on get getting huge portions and great quality..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, everything u get is just prefect and the family that works there are just so friendly"}
