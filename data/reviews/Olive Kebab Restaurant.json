{"text":"Food is good and portions are generous, BUT they are extremely rude, and rush you through your order so they can get your money and get you out. Never going back there. If you like rude people then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"My husband picked up take out from here this week and it was delicious! I got a chicken shawarma wrap and it was huge! The chicken was moist and delicious and the toppings were both plentiful and flavourful. My husband got the chicken shawarma platter and it was great as well. This is a great addition to the neighbourhood and we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The best Shawarma around. It's made with the freshest ingredients I've ever had, and the portion was huge. Super friendly owners as well."}
{"text":"The portions are HUGE. A half wrap is more than enough for me. The falafel was made fresh and the selection of toppings was great! Would love if they added pickles to the toppings, but fantastic either way. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food is GREAT. Loved the service and they serve so much food. Ingredients are fresh. I had the chicken shawarma wrap(1/2) and my husband had the chicken shawarma plate for lunch and I think we are not having dinner tonight lol. Oh, please try the eggplant!"}
{"text":"I came in here for the first time after reading good reviews about it. I tried the chicken shawarma wrap and it did not disappoint! It had well seasoned meat, fresh veggies, and a soft wrap. Very satisfying! The staff was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I like olives and kebabs but not at this place. It was recognized and recomme ded but just not to my tastes"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a Mediterranean restaurant open near me. I got a bunch of orders, to feed 6. Everything was fantastic. I loved the appetizer platter, with pickled beets and delicious hummous. The falafel balls were tasty and not dry, which is a common fault. The lamb skewers blew my mind. I had to stop myself from eating them all on the group! Quinoa salad was a nice, raw option.  One downside was there was only one person working, so it took a while to put together. If there was a lineup, I can only imagine.  I will be coming back again. Soon.  No pics cuz we destroyed it."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite! I have had the falafel half laffa twice and it is HUGE - keeps me full for the rest of the day, which is hard to do! They have an amazing selection of toppings, create each dish with lots of care, and keep everything so clean! I once stopped in for some hummus to go with the rest of my lunch and they made it fresh. The owners are so nice and pleasant to talk to, I love stopping in for lunch when I can!"}
{"text":"We were in the area for meetings and saw this restaurant using yelp.  A group of us went there and the place was awesome! Very clean, the employees were friendly and the pricing was very reasonable. The food was excellent I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Whenever I go I feel like I'm eating at my aunties house. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really great food. I got the Chicken Skewer which was really good. Also service was nice big portions and got extra rice!"}
{"text":"Found this gem not far from parklawn after checking Yelp for a quick healthier bite. Stopped by and got the XL Falafel wrap and was amazzzzzing. This will be a weekly stop for me now as the quality and home cooked aspect of this place is a keeper. Owners were so nice and enjoyed their energy. I'd reco this lil place any day!"}
{"text":"for as long I have been with my significant other I have been searching for a local place for shawarma, and honestly I've tried a lot of places, local and not local, I have my favorites in the core but now I have found a favorite locally...FINALLY! I'm always popping in and out of shoppers drug mart for the post office and the first thing I see walking back to my car is the olive kebab! last night I was fortunate enough to be of the mindset to actually walk in and grab myself some dinner after 3 hours of running around after work. I walked into this restaurant and was instantly impressed by them having lamb as an option. I had the full laffa lamb and the full laffa chicken. I was told it would be a ten minute wait, which was fine by me. I'm not sure of the gentleman's name behind the counter making the food, but watching him cook was like watching poetry in motion. I know that may come across as funny, but im being 100% serious when I say that. he asked me to come up and pick my toppings to which I did, and im not even going to lie, when he was done it looked as though he painted a photo...on each of the laffa's. after all the food was cooked and wrapped in packages I tell you that I have never been given food so carefully and wrapped to attentively. got home and dove right into the food.  to say that the food was excellent is an understatement, the lamb wrap alone shook me down to my foundation and made me super happy and full of energy. very flavorful, very bright in color. just all around amazing.   I am very, very happy to call this location one of my favorites in Toronto and its been along time coming. the server behind the counter is one of the nicest and friendliest servers I have dealt with.  extremely happy and I can't wait to come back very very soon.   OUTSTANDING FOOD!  5+/5!"}
