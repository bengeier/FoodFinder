{"text":"Pizza is delicious! And very fast delivery...really impressed. Plus it was cold and bad weather out but still managed to deliver earlier than expected time given! Happy customer and will definitely order here again"}
{"text":"Just like I remembered!  I have not been here in decades.  It,s the family pizza pace with great quality that you forgot ever existed.  Nothing fancy just great food.  It is nice to know these places still exist.  Dough on pizza is very crunchy not like those shake and bake frozen pizzas. Prices are reasonable and service is excellent.  It is  very casual. Perfect for takeout.  If you don't mind the small dining room, you will enjoy eating inside.  There are wings and other things on the menu.  Nice family restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst Service EVER!! Me and my boyfriend ordered a pizza from there on Friday night.  I actually placed the order for the pizza with one half pepperoni and onion, and then the other half mushroom and bacon.  (I knew off the bat that the lady i talked to was confused, but thought that she would figure it out).  Well, when my boyfriend went to pick up the pizza, they had made it incorrectly, and proceeded to tell him that it was my fault. and that i need to learn how to order a pizza and instructed him on how i should order it going forward.  Please....its not rocket science.  I repeated that order to the lady on the phone three different times, and she was still confused....but it couldnt have been her fault over the mess up....blame it on your costumer....nice..And for that matter, they had our phone number, if they were confused, they should have called us back and asked...not thrown something together  .Well, they put pepperoni on the whole thing and then said that they wouldnt charge us for it as a courtesy.....if we wanted pepperoni on the whole pizza, wouldnt we have ordered it that way?.  After they made the pizza, they must have realized they made it without the bacon, threw the bacon on top and then must have recooked it, because the bacon, if you can call it that, was completely burnt, along with the rest of the pizza.  My boyfriend was still waiting on the breadsticks we ordered along with the pizza, and when they came up, the Owner/manager working, threw them on top of the pizza box he was holding, and said \"here you go, Bud\".     We got the pizza home, had a couple bites and threw it out....it was awful...along with the Customer Service....Needless to say, we will NEVER give them our business again, and advise everyone to stay away as well!!!"}
{"text":"For our first visit and definitely not our last, this pizza restaurant comes highly recommended!!!  Very nice , courteous and friendly staff. Outstanding pizza with generous toppings!! Immediate seating with fast and courteous serving!! One of the few eat in pizza places in Strongsville. We give it a five star rating."}
{"text":"I have been eating this pizza my entire life, more than 30 years.  It is hands down my favorite pizza in the entire world, and I have eaten pizza in Italy!  The crust is real crust, not this crazy flat, no edge crust Columbus, Ohio people seem to love.  The cheese is delicious and they do not skimp on it.  I almost only get pepperoni and the pepperoni is my favorite pepperoni.  This is a greasy, mouth watering, wonderful temptation.    I have lived in Columbus for over 12 years and EVERY time I am visiting Cleveland (which is several times a year) I get a pizza from here.  I sometimes get one to take back home also.  This pizza also reheats amazingly well in the oven.  My husband sometimes likes it better reheated (only in the oven!  no microwave!)!  I should also mention my husband has never lived in Cleveland and this is now one of his favorite pizza places also!  The restaurant itself is very small and there is not enough seating.  Pizza is something we almost exclusively get to go so that doesn't bother me but if you do want to actually eat there, be aware that it's not the easiest place to snag a table at."}
{"text":"Extremely clean, great management and service is excellent whether dining in, picking up or ordering delivery.  Location is in a prime spot, great for a quick bite or lunch / dinner with friends and family, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from them multiple times and enjoyed their food.. however... every time I order online they have messed our order up.  On the phone, they can misunderstand you.  Online, the order is typed out!  Wild pepper, thin crust with extra pepperoncinis and banana peppers, light sauce, well done.  We get a traditional crust without ANY of the wild pepper ingredients and ONLY pepperoncinis and banana peppers and not at all well done.  After writing them an e-mail explaining it (to which I still have not received a direct response) they offered my girlfriend (who went into their shop with the offending pie) to upgrade her order, etc. right on the spot and offered a $10 off coupon for our next order, GREAT, RIGHT?  Yeah, only good for pickup in this blizzard after they messed up our order on at least four occasions I can think of.  Try Geppetto's, Giusseppe's, Jet's, or even Panini's pizzas are better in town and I have never had an order messed up as bad as these guys do."}
{"text":"Called to place order and was told to \"please Hold\" 6 times but was immediately hung up on each time and not put on hold. Seriously? Person answering would not even allow a second for a question or to let him know he was handing up on people. After 20 minutes of this ordered from another place. Not a good first experience at this location and probably the last ."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza on the 25th of January to my address  in Twinsburg Ohio, I wanted another pizza today  and suddenly we can't get it delivered to our address because of a \"safety\" concern when it is actually a \"race\" concern. Their words: \"My drivers work minimum wage plus tips and doesn't want to risk their safety.\"This is a predominantly black area and apparently we're vicious animals that prey on pizza drivers. Seeing as the Twinsburg Sheriff's department patrols this area and practically LIVES in this area. They took the money off my card and now I have to wait 24-hours to get the money back on my card. The only money I had left to feed my family. I will never do business with this pizza place ever again. I will make it known that the owner of this establishment is racist."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience from start to finish! The guy who was working at the counter was friendly and hooked us up with a coupon deal without us even asking. We ordered a small house salad and the medium Pane Diablo pizza with peppadew peppers and it was delicious! I highly recommend you try this pizza!"}
{"text":"Just picked up a veggie pizza and pasta dinner.  The pizza had a taste that was unexpected.  I can't figure out what the taste was, but it was not the taste of good pizza.  The pasta was below average.   Four stars for the staff. One star for the food."}
{"text":"I don't like to review pizza places on Yelp since I'm a bit biased to Angelo's in Lakewood.  By far the best pizza in Cleveland.  However, Master's has been growing on me.  They have a large menu with all sorts of pizza, apps, and salads.  The house Italian dressing is VERY good, and I bring home a bottle with me each time.  The pizza is above average with fresh ingredients.  The parking lot is a total nightmare!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has definitely gone down hill. Used to enjoy coming here and within the past year the food quality, service and overall environment has declined.   The sauce has changed in my opinion ( and not for the better), service was awful. It took about 20 minutes just to get our drink orders. I had to ask for a straw twice and never got one. Tables and floors were dirty. Sadly, it wasn't even busy. There was on other couple in the dining room section.  I would advise to stay away!"}
{"text":"Very good Pizza made with top notch cheese and toppings. Great sauce, zesty with a bit of sweetness, generous amount of high quality cheese, and premium quality toppings make this a delicious Pizza. I found the crust however to lack in flavor and in my visits the crust consistency has been inconsistent. I have had Pizza there that left too much crust uncovered by sauce/toppings. When the pizza is topped properly from edge to edge the crust has a very nice chew, but in cases where too much crust was exposed it was overcooked and hard. Though the crust itself lacks in flavor, you may add a free dipping sauce to your order. Their Pizza toppings overall are perhaps the best I've ever had. Peppadew peppers are a must! Sweet, tangy, plump and juicy. Their sausage and saut√©ed mushrooms were particularly delicious as well.   They have a large selection of toppings, sauces, and specialty pizzas. I have tried the 'Peppadew Punch' and '3 Little Pigs' specialty pizzas and would order both again.   Considering the overall quality, coupons built into website/app, and rewards program app, this is a great value. Fair prices to begin with, then add greater value by applying the appropriate coupon from their website/app (nice to not have to find one in a mailer). Plus earn freebies over time through their convenient app."}
{"text":"Was OK. Crust was kinda mushy. Cheese and sauce was actually good. I liked the way they arranged the pepperoni."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to Chagrin! It has become a Friday night staple at our household to order Masters! Best Homeade Pizza!"}
{"text":"O.K. I've ordered pizza from here a few times as it's the closest place to my home. They are a local chain with about eight locations. I've read the reviews and honestly can't understand where these 5-Star ratings come from. Their pizza is inconsistent at best.  I usually order pepperoni, but have had other toppings as well. The best deal is the \"Awesome Deal,\" a large, 16-inch, 1-topping pizza for $10.99. Just walk in and say that's what you want, their coupons never seems to expire and are available at the entrance. They proclaim they have been named the \"Best Pizza in America\" for four years running by PMQ Magazine, whatever that is. But every time I order a pizza from them I find something wrong. Once it was an underdone crust; still gooey inside. Never an acceptable mistake.  Yes, they provide an nice amount of cheese and the sauce is tasty. But one quirk is they \"stack\" the pepperoni on each other in a line. Perhaps they do that to set their selves off from everyone else. Unfortunately it means part of each slice is nice and slightly crisp and part is not. But the biggest problem is I have NEVER received a 16-inch pizza from them! It always measures less. Once it barely stretched out to over 14 inches. Don't believe me? Measure it for yourself. So, Master Pizza, when not measuring up to your own internal standards I cannot give you glowing results. Sorry.  I will add that the staff has always acted in a spot-on way. They have never been less than friendly and helpful. I wish the pizza was up to the same standards.  Quick update: The price for the 16-inch pizza has now gone to $12.49 according to their latest flyer. No word on if the 16-inch pizza is now actually 16 inches!"}
{"text":"While visiting my Husband's family, we decided to eat at this awesome pizza place he ate at all the time when he was younger.  The pizza was DELICIOUS!!  The staff was super friendly and Vince made me laugh.  We ordered a small pepperoni and bacon as I was only expecting to eat 1 slice after having a big late lunch.  Turns out, I ate 3 slices and we ended up ordering another for me to eat 3 more.  The crust is perfect!  Thank you guys for a great dinner and we will definitely be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of this pizza shop. I even voted for them. As we know sometimes we can grow too fast. We have had several problems with Master pizza including tonight. We have been waiting close to an hour and a half. With no call from them at all..ordered a penne pasta from them last week and got spaghetti.i will post picture of the receipt with the food. Dont take a genius to figure it out..going down. Very fast..i guess we would feel better if they showed us a little respect and they gave a crap. Think twice b4 u call. Great food when its right. But not worth the hassle anymore."}
{"text":"Price is too high for the food they serve. Plus the service sucks, we came to eat in and told us that it'll be 20 mins wait time and it took about an hour for our food to get ready. We ordered to eat in and they packed our food to go, then we had to open all the food and eat there. Ordered 2 medium pizza, some wings and a drink and end up paying close to 50 bucks, should've gone to a nice restaurant instead! Never going back to this place again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend's and my favorite pizza place in Cleveland. Really friendly workers, really delicious pizza that is seasoned well.   We've gotten the Master Popeye with pepperoni and the Meat Lover's with tomato slices and spinach. Both were baked to perfection! I especially like that their sausage topping doesn't just consist of flat, gray hot-doggish-like disks... these are more like crumbled or torn sausage pieces packed with lots of flavor."}
{"text":"I was here on a Friday night for my nephew's birthday party.  We had a large group who arrived at different times, but the staff was well prepared and accomodating.  The kids were pretty loud and running around, but there weren't many other people dining in, and no one seemed to mind.  The pizza was excellent.  The mushrooms were fresh, not canned, which is always a big deal for me.  The crust was crisp on the bottom, but chewey on top."}
{"text":"If you are calling in an order, prepare for disappointment. The girl that answers the phone doesn't know the difference between breadsticks and garlic bread. I had to explain this twice only to realize when I got home I got something completely different. Plus, its not a 15-20 min wait time, prepare to sit and wait for 45 mins before your pizza is ready. And no I do not want a \"free\" soda while I wait for the pizza I ordered. I would just prefer to get my correct order and on time."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem and one of my favorite pizza places in cle. I love the house dressing and am a huge fan of the buffalo chicken. What a great quick, casual pizza spot!"}
{"text":"THIS is the THE Original Master Pizza I grew up with over 30 years ago in Lakewood.  It is the same taste, excellent quality ingredients and perfect balance I've always loved about Master Pizza.  I went to the new location on Bagley Rd in Middleburg Hts.  All I can say it that you must try it!  It deserves every accolade and pizza contest victory it has received.  I picked it up from a great distance away twice in one week.  They also have dine in and the restaurant appeared to be clean and new througout.  A good family pizza place with plenty of room.  YOU MUST HAVE THIS PIZZA.  It is a 10.  My family agrees"}
{"text":"THIS IS IT!  Welcome Back to Master Pizza.  The SAME recipe we all remember from our youth.  Never changed a bit and boy are we glad about that.  I took several to a party over the winter and now we're coming today in person where I'm sure it will be even better.  The pizza is cheesy and sauce is cooked to perfection. Go here and DO this.  I would rate it a 10 except it stops me at 5!! GREAT PIZZA!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed as we used to live in Mayfield and always enjoyed Master Pizza. We were excited that Master Pizza had come to Chagrin where we now live. I had asked the girl on the phone if meat came on the salad and she had told me no did I want the antipasta? I told her I didn't want meat. At home open salad and there is pepperoni on salad. I cut up my own salad at home because I wanted to use there usually wonderful dressing and it tasted like water. The pizza was extremely salty as well, not sure if it is because they just opened and are still getting things in order but huge disappointment."}
{"text":"The best part about Master Pizza is they make you feel so welcome...like you are family.  They will get to know you by name.  Service is attentive and friendly.  The food is a solid 3 stars...nothing really special.  Hard-to-find soft drinks are served like cream soda, grape Crush and cherry cola.  The funny part about Master Pizza?  From the road it looks like they are always closed.  Turn some lights on, people.  And get a giant neon sign that says OPEN."}
{"text":"Had a 50 percent off coupon so thought I would give this place a try.  Let me say I enjoy a good, greasy, local joint pizza....but this was a little over the top.  I only ordered pepperoni...and the entire pizza was swimming in grease.  In fact, four napkins full of grease.  A bit much for me.  Cheese was good and the crust was good.  Sauce was ok, not great.  IMO  In their defense, it was very busy, and the wait staff was pleasant.  Will try it again for wings and a sandwich...."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. Love the calzones and the salads. So much better than the chains like Papa Johns (garbage). The online ordering is a train wreck."}
{"text":"Great delicious with unique  selections.  Cheesy garlic white sauce is excellent and addictive.  They don't skimp on toppings.  Staff has always been friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family because I heard this was a sit down pizza place! They have a small dining room with booths, tables and chairs and lots of TV's with sporting events and cartoons for the littles on! They also have free arcade games for up to two people per table- with two tables down the hall near the bathrooms! Have the kids play a few games while they wait for their food!  We enjoyed the cheese, the specialty pepperoni, and the Manhattan. The pepperoni pizza was the star! Spicy, zesty, and delicious! The Manhattan was good too, it's got chicken, spinach, and tomato on it and a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette glaze. I enjoyed it, but would have preferred a balsamic reduction as the vinaigrette tasted very much like vinegar! We also really enjoyed our cherrywood bbq wings! Mmmm so good!  The family really enjoyed this place, great food and our server was really nice! We will definitely stop back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Pane Diablo pizza this evening - original pizza sauce (note: I did ask for extra on it), crushed red pepper, Cup n Char spicy pepperoni, pepperdews (these are little red sweet with just a touch of spice to them), banana peppers and finished with parm.  The pizza was darn good and reminded me of the Master PIzza that I would get from their original Mayfield location 35 years ago.  Sauce is great. Toppings are good and they put a decent proper amount on the pizza.  I enjoy their dough.  The variation that I can see from the reviews - I bet it is who makes the pizza.  If you have someone that doesn't care about anything, they just slap out a typical big franchise pizza.  If they care, you will get a good pie.  I guess that is the problem with expanding - you cannot guarantee the final product - it is out of your hands.  Their menu is extensive and includes the \"build your own\" type salads to your wings and sub sandwiches. The store, located in Avon Commons had seating for about 50 - relatively limited but good enough if you are in a pinch.  Overall I will definitely go back and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Food always good at mayfield, salads too Now we try twinsburg   Server just okay. Seemed to busy talking with cooks. Had to ask for napkins with our salads. Salads were just okay. Not cut too much and just put on a plate top it with cheese and pepperoni  As for the pizza, not the same atmosphere but just as good. Crust is great and just the right cheese on top with items on top of cheese Definitely would come back at least for carry out"}
{"text":"Had Master pizza since I was a kid. Love that we have one now in Twinsburg.   Get the sausage pizza. It is awesome. Get a salad too with house dressing. It is very good. I think it's the cheese. Sauce is good. Not too sweet.   We will continue to order Master Pizza at our house. We love it. For a local pizza place and franchise. Their recipes are great."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever.  It's not the best pizza in the world, but it is pretty good.  It's an eating experience there as well, with the narrow hall and coolers lined up chock full of drinks.  Great place to take kids- hit Master Pizza for dinner and East Coast Custard for dessert.  Now that's a great family night."}
{"text":"Ugh... Master Pizza, why must you disappoint me so?! In the past few years, Master Pizza has gone from Master Pizza to Corradi's Master Pizza to Corradi's Pizza and back to Master Pizza. Recently this location was purchased by the franchise that owns locations on the east side. Unfortunately, during this last transition, the entire menu changed, as did the recipes.   This was my go-to place for takeout wings. They were glorious. No breading, freshly fried, delicious sauce-- they were great. Until they changed ownership.  I ordered wings last night and first was told they didn't have the signature mild sauce that I grew to love. I asked for buffalo instead. The wings were small and breaded. Not at all like the old wings. Most of them got thrown away. Major sad face here. :(  My hubby ordered pizzas. The sauce recipe changed (I think). The pizzas just weren't the same. The cheese was melted but not browned like it normally is. They were generous with toppings, though. But IMHO, the pizza from 3 Brothers, Capri, Goodfellas' or even Papa John's is far superior.   I hate to say it, but we have no reason to go back. I'm sad that the Corradi name is gone. The food was so good. Why mess with a good thing? :("}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza joints on the eastside! It's consistently good.  Fresh toppings, good sauce-not too sweet, not too much,  mozzarella slightly browned, and the dough-not burnt or too doughy.  This is a solid pizza place. My favorite topping here is pepperoni.  We usually eat at the restaurant.  Sidenote it's a good next-day cold pizza!!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite pizza delivery spot! Love their unique combinations on the specialty pizzas.  I've become obsessed with one that has chicken, bacon, cheese, tomato and a swirl of ranch dressing on top!  My husband likes the one with multiple kinds of pepperoni.  Because the small specialty pizzas are small, we can each order our own and try different kinds.  Looking forward to sampling more of their varied menu!"}
{"text":"It's been an hour and a half since we ordered our food for delivery..our food still isn't here. I called when we were waiting for an hour and they said they \"got backed up and your order is on its way\"the guy couldn't wait to get off the phone and hung up on me..after 30 minutes, it's still not here. This isn't the the first time this happened but it sure will be the last. Poor service and so SLOWWWWWWWWWWW."}
{"text":"Super slow service and there are only 4 tables! Had to ask for napkins after salads came. Wasn't till about 20 minutes later she came to take the rest of our order. Then it still took forever just for a pizza. I think they focus more on the take out orders. Food was decent but not as good as the Mayfield location. Pizza was too light on sauce but generous with the toppings. Salad smaller. I don't like that neither location has fountain pop, only bottles. Not a deal breaker though."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place! Veggie supreme is my personal favorite. The crust almost has a sweetness to it. Delivery is always sooner than they quote. The price is pretty affordable. For parties or events we order the sheet pizzas always fresh and everyone seems to really enjoy the pizza."}
{"text":"This is apparently a popular joint in the area and we order this all the time at my work. I must say though that this pizza is not sauced well enough an the cheese is stale in my opinion. They could overall do better and I would much rather order from a Pizza Hut, Jett's or even a Dominos."}
{"text":"I give this place a 2 star because the food is decent and ingredients are fresh, but they need to train their employees better. The delivery driver started bitching (excuse my language) at me for not being able to find my house and not being able to park properly. It's not a big street .. there are many streets you can park on and most delivery drivers find my house via something called a GPS.. and park right in front of my driveway.. cars will not ram into you if u are parked by my driveway.. I don't think he really needed to be such a jerk to a customer, HE depends on for his salary. Never ordering from this place again.. there are way too many pizza places that are amazing and competitive for me to continue to order from this place with terrible customer service. BTW.. they gave me broccoli instead of tomatoes.. Bravo! Hahaha"}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza that we have had, it's continuously delicious every time. The staff are friendly, and the wings are awesome too."}
{"text":"So it looks like this company removed itself from yelp and re-added itself to remove the negative reviews from others.   Wow, what a crappy tactic!  So I'll summarize: For four of us (two adults, two children) the bill came to $84! For pizza! Wayyyy overpriced, the \"home-made\" meatballs, which we were told the owner's grandmother makes by hand, had 3 small bones in them. Our calzones were around $25 each! No way, never again. The pizza sauce was bland and the dough/crust not flavorful. Very disappointing, and more so considering this behavior! At least the reviews are archived."}
{"text":"I am so torn on this place!  It has a lot of hype out there!  We've been there to eat and have had delivery.  A plain cheese pizza is not memorable by any means here.  However, if you request the pasta sauce in place of pizza sauce, and add some balsamic drizzle, YUM.  We did dine in once and ordered the potato skins....and considering this is award winning pizza, I was crazy dissapointed when they came out freezer burnt.  This place is truly a mixed bag."}
{"text":"Of all the different pizza restaurants in Strongsville I have tried everyone's wings and master Pizza and Strongsville is by far the best! They are truly addicting the sauce is great in the wings are baked not fried!!! Good job!!!"}
{"text":"The sides were better then the pizza. The bread bights we're great and the pepperoni pizza only had 3 pieces of pepperoni on each slice. I felt like it was a little on the skimpy side of things. Very friendly and would go back but will not get the pepperoni pizza next time."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite pizza places (outside of Chicago:-), I prefer local pizza places over national chains.  The crust is just right, not too thin, not too thick. I love, love, love the Italian sausage, nice size pieces with lots of fennel. The sauce is also very tasty.  The staff is always very welcoming.  Definitely my go-to place for good pizza."}
{"text":"You know how sometimes reviews begin with \"I'm not sure where to start?\" This isn't one of those. I know where to start because I am still tasting it. This pizza is super weird because it has virtually no flavor. There is no taste to the actual pizza (not sure how that is accomplished), but if you are patient and can get through a whole piece, it does has an aftertaste! I personally like my tasting to come while I am actually eating the food not after I have swallowed it. Afterward though, there is a general presence of bleh...I can't quite place it, maybe garlic powder? Either way, whatever it is, it. will. not. leave. your. mouth- bummer. This pizza makes up for all the non tasting it did earlier way after it's gone. All I can say is better get some toppings on your pie so you can at least taste something while it's going down the hatch.  We also got a \"Master House Salad.\" Two people were sharing so we got a large. Let me sum up quickly here: square styrofoam box, filled with semi dried out iceberg lettuce, lightly sprinkled with pizza cheese = $6.50. Oh and I forgot and a few slices of pepperoni. To top it all off \"Masters Famous Italian Dressing\" which they sell- by the pint! Must be good then right? I mean they sell this stuff so it must be proprietary and it's \"famous!\" Let me save some more time here: mostly oil, then a little white vinegar. I guess it's the WHITE vinegar that distinguishes it and makes it famous? Mmmm oily iceberg lettuce. If you can't hear the wha wha wha music yet let me cut the review so it can play. I'll save even more time- wait for the next pizza place to grace Avon Commons."}
{"text":"I previously reviewed this place as a 5/5 star rating but as of late they have been very disappointing. It seems like every time I order from here the pizza is WAY under cooked even though I specify for it to be well done every single time. I may order from here once more but I swear if I get another under cooked pizza that will be my last time."}
{"text":"This place cannot be affiliated with the other master pizzas. Brunswick mp is amazing. This place in north royalton is awful."}
{"text":"Yes one star. Trust me I was shocked as well. Master Pizza once upon a time had the best pizza in Cleveland. Sadly that is no longer even remotely the case. We have given this place lots and I do mean lots of business, but after last night that has ended. We ordered at 4:30 and when the pizza arrived in a rather timely fashion the large half pepperoni - half mushroom was not even warm plus the pizza was doughy, The wings which we asked for well done were also not warm and were anything but well done. This is not the first time this has happened, but we kept giving them another chance hoping things would get better. They haven't. It is pretty clear now that the kitchen is just churning out the food and could care less how it is served. I believe they are taking out the pizzas before they are completely cooked hence the doughy texture. And for the wings well they're also not fully cooking them because hey this way they can, I guess in their minds, make room for more orders and make more money. Well that is until faithful customers like myself say enough is enough. So I called back to tell them about the awful food. They were nice enough to offer to resend. I called at 5 and it took two entire hours before the food arrived this time more cooked, but again cold. They are using warming bags, but they obviously do nothing. I believe this is in part because they wait to deliver the food until they have lots of deliveries so either the food is getting cold while waiting at the store or while in the car as they deliver all of the other orders before yours. Either way Master Pizza obviously doesn't care because they are making lots and lots of money. Imagine yourself just wanting to eat dinner and it taking nearly three hours and the food the second time around is still way below sub par. Yes they once were very, very good, but somewhere along the way they stopped caring about the food and it became only about the money. Time to find another pizza place. One that actually cares about their customers."}
{"text":"With all of the pizza chains around, Master Pizza is my go to Pizza place around Mayfield. I ordered a large sausage and pepperoni and after devouring my portion of the Pizza, my stomach felt like it had hit the jackpot. I always go for their garlic bread which is a nice little appetizer before the main pie.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN CLEVELAND AREA!  This is the original Master Pizza that I had every week in the 1960s, they are still using that recipe from the originators!  This location has been here for many many years, and it's fantastic.  This is not a fancy place, but that makes it even better that it is your local Pizzeria.  It is delicious pizza, and the service was very friendly.  I LOVE it here, and I wish I lived closer.  Any time I am out on the East Side, I have to eat here.  Best pizza this side of New York City! I am so glad they are still around!"}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my parents, and they suggested we try Master Pizza. My parents had been here a few times before and loved it, and they couldn't wait for me to try it!   Well my parents were right! The pizza is out of this world! Great tasting sauce and fresh veggies for toppings. We also enjoyed the wings, the cherrywood BBQ sauce is delicious!  I will be back to Master Pizza next time I come home to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza spot in Chagrin. The people here are down to earth and make a solid pizza everytime. It's always nice and well done, just how I ask them for it. Don't pass up the side salad, their house dressing here is awesome."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN CLEVELAND - hands down!!! I've been going here since before I can I remember and it's a favorite spot for the whole family. Still haven't found a better pizza place, nothing can beat Master Pizza!"}
{"text":"Been here a number of times. Detroit pizza a huge miss. Ordered 1/2 pound of wings 4X crispy. 5 little wings showed up that I had to put in the toaster oven. Really.   Besides that, the pizza was all dough. No real flavor as described. Their food has been better. I fear they are falling into the abyss of to go food purgatory. It's a shame, as we had high hopes. Avon needs good places to eat as we are being falsely swayed by Melt and the likes. Stay true to your product as we grew up and remember Master pizza"}
{"text":"Ordered here for the first time a couple days ago.  I ordered a small double cheese pizza.  That's it. Ready in 40 minutes.  Ok.  Stopped in to pick it up and first was surprised by how small a small pizza actually is here.  It's literally about the size other places call a \"personal\" size.  Then there is the price.  $9.25.  What?!! Holy cow.  A VERY small double cheese with absolutely no toppings...$9.25!  Yikes!   As far as the taste goes, it tasted fine and I liked the cheese ok.  The dough was just ok.  I was still hungry after eating this thing.  Way too little for the price paid. Considering everything, I would much rather purchase a large 1 topping pizza at one of those $5 for a large pizza places.  May not be quite the quality of Master Pizza, but I would be paying half the price and walking away with a full gut."}
{"text":"Got the spinach artichoke.   Good pizza for Ohio.  I would like more toppings and less cheese."}
{"text":"Loveeeee master pizza! The pepperoni passion is amazing, cold! Seriously try it!  Also the Detroit red top is my absolute new favorite! Pick up time is usually always 20 minutes....even on Friday nights which is very convenient! Great place!"}
{"text":"So happy one of my favorite family owned east side pizzerias I grew up with is now on the west side.  Great, fresh home made food!  Thank goodness west-sider's now a have choice from the cookie cutter national franchises that serve cardboard pizzas.  Pizza is so good it even tastes better out of the fridge the next day!  Friendly, helpful staff!"}
{"text":"We stayed at a local hotel with a softball team and were late coming home and hungry. Master pizza delivered amazing pizza, bread, and salad to us. The pizza was HUGE and delicious as well as the salads and bread! Very pleased! The service was awesome as well."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, Thank You Jason. I ordered the Mediterranean pizza, meatball sub and chicken wings. I asked for crispy and sauces on the side. Everything was delivered exactly as I asked for it and hot. I highly recommend them based on service, taste and 100% satisfaction. Thank you again and keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Quite a bit better than the typical franchise pizza place in the area, and the big difference is the crust. It tastes like pizza crust should -- not this spongy garbage we've gotten used to. Generous with cheese and toppings too, and having a dine-in option is a welcome change. We've visited 3 times in the past 4 weeks, so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! But if you are not in the mood for pizza try their hot subs or the chicken quesadilla! Another favorite is the garlic toasted French bread. Great place!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Very tasty and nice toppings.  Reasonably priced too.    This may be our new \"go to\" pizza shop."}
{"text":"Wouldn't exactly call this a masterpiece, or the best pizza I ever had, but it was decent. The most memorable thing is the huge, doughy calzone with very generous fillings - delicious! Very friendly staff and a small dining room too (much larger than it looks from the outside)."}
{"text":"Master Pizza is some of the best pizza around. Their sauce, cheese and crust is incredible. Their subs are very good too. They are quick as well. Whether picking up or delivery."}
{"text":"Great pizza that really deserves all of its awards! The staff was also very friendly. We visited from out-of-town but plan on stopping again on our return."}
{"text":"Well we thought let's try master pizza in twinsburg.   We called at 6:37.  45 minute delivery time. When we called at 7:50 we were told it was one minute away. It arrived at 8:03.  It was cold. Driver was rude. Acted like we were crazy for checking out the cold pizza.  If you are hungry or like quality food do not order from this place.  What a rotten experience. First and last time."}
{"text":"The best pizza in the Cleveland area! Great crust great cheese. Be sure to try the meatballs?"}
{"text":"Tried to order online from an address on the same street, told they don't deliver here."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pizza. It's our favorite for delivery. Love their white sauce and the fact they carry Caesar salad.  The crust is yummy.  Delivery people super friendly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I try to go to Master Pizza whenever we are in town. The Specialty Pizzas are the best. On our last visit we had the Big Kahuna and it was incredible. I was reluctant to try a pineapple pizza but it was delicious. Also, we ate the whole thing which is ridiculous. We've had the Bacon Bleu Sirloin too, which was great. We weren't crazy about the Buffalo Chicken - it wasn't very buffalo-y. My mom always gets the Popeye. We've seen other people order the wings, pasta, subs, and salads, and they all look amazing (although we haven't tried them yet.) Master Pizza is a really, really tiny place. Sometimes that has a neat charm, but sometimes it just feels cramped. I'm pretty sure there is only ever one server so you can wait for a while. What Master Pizza could really use is a good drink list; They have a cooler with a few drinks up front, but it's mostly pop and that's where people wait for carryout orders so it's near impossible to get to. It is not a fancy place - plastic drinking cups and paper napkins wrapped around your silverware, so only go here if you are looking for a good, casual meal. Not a ton of parking but, like I said, not very many people could fit inside anyway."}
{"text":"I was quoted a 20 minute wait time and I am currently sitting inside and it has been over 50 minutes and my pizza isn't even in the oven. There were also a few individuals in front of me who were upset because their orders were very late, too.  They prepared the wrong pizza at first which has now extended my wait time even further... They were at least nice enough to give me a free pizza on my next order."}
{"text":"I wish master pizza was around when I was a kid ordering pizza every Saturday.  When I think of a classic pizza, this is what I picture.  Everything tasted great and most importantly, good fold."}
{"text":"Not great....pizza was dry, little sauce. Crust was over done. We had 2 pizza's: pepperoni and Mediterranean. Both were dry and lacking flavor. We will not be going back"}
{"text":"Ok, I gave it another shot and Master Pizza redeemed themselves.  The pizza was above average, but most importantly it was not black and burned on the bottom like last time."}
{"text":"I go way back with Masters to the Warrensville and Harvard location and I'm glad to see them surge back into prominence. A real throwback with the 'rich' sausage and that sauce with the familial hit of oregano. Until there's a Masters in Lakewood, I'll just have to drive to Avon, Strongsville or Parma for a legacy pizza. But that's just me."}
{"text":"Make Em Say Uhh!!! Uhhh!!! Yah, Ya, Yah, Ya!!!  --Master P.  Master Pizza has probably been around for much longer than the aforementioned No Limit Soldier, but you know what? Master Pizza made me say Yah, not Nah, Na, Nah, Na.  Better than average pizza dough, flavorful sauce, greasy cheese and quality toppings (ie. thick chunks of bulk sausage w/ fennel seeds), not the typical unsavory grayish slices.  A 50% off coupon from an entertainment book brought me to Master Pizza recently. Located in an unassuming plaza on Mayfield Rd, just across from WalMart, expectations weren't the highest. I've never been here, never heard about it, but decided to give it a shot. And I'm glad I did.   Although we didn't eat in, they do have a small dining area. We chose to take the pie home. Sinfully greasy, I was presently surprised at how great this pie was! It's definitely in the running for my top 5 pizza joint's on the East Side list which I'll be compiling shortly."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza place. The taste is similar to Jets Pizza. They offer square pizzas Detroit style which is always my go to pizza. Crust was thick and crunchy, sauce perfect, and pepperonis crunchy! Hot and delicious! It would only been better if they were closer to my house. They offer online ordering which is by far the best way to order a pizza."}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp, for sure a new favorite.  Great pizza and wings that are just like Quaker steak wings, especially their BBQ sauce tastes almost identical.  Pretty good prices too and staff seemed friendly for just picking up an order."}
{"text":"Several people have made the statement that this is best pizza in Cleveland. Although I cannot confirm that, I can say without any hesitation that this is on the list of top 3 best pizzas I've ever tried anywhere, period. The double pepperoni with artichoke was extremely flavorful, you could taste the quality of ingredients. Freshness, quality and exquisite preparation. I will now be a regular here."}
{"text":"The first thing my Mom said was, \"I used to love Master Pizza as a kid!\" -- seems to be a common thread here! Why is good pizza so hard to find in the suburbs? And how did I never know this was here? When my brother brought home Master Pizza, I didn't have high expectations. But I was pleasantly surprised by this batch of pizza pie. The sauce had a nice, sweet flavor, and the cheese was thick enough without being stingy or greasy. The sausage on the pizza was hearty and well-seasoned and it was a little more high-quality. There's not really too much to say in a review about pizza-- I mean, has anyone ever met pizza they didn't like? Overall, we liked Master Pizza and i'd totally order again."}
{"text":"I will never order from here again.   Cons: The pizza must have been sitting out for too long before it was delivered (9-10p on a Friday), because it was already cold once we received it - the cheese was beginning to congeal and coagulate. The House Italian dressing tasted close to being just vinegar. Garlic bread was so-so. The whole order just stated..... off.   Pros: Cheap. The specialty pizzas were unique."}
{"text":"Their pizzas are pretty decent, however, nearly every time I come here for the lunch special ($5 for 2 slices and pop) and they NEVER have enough pizza ready for more than one-two people. So you either wait 20 minutes, or just leave."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the Strongsville location, so decided to try this location. Placed a delivery order, and it took 70 minutes to arrive. Pizza was lukewarm and we had to reheat it. Was incredibly disappointed with what we received and the poor timing."}
{"text":"We stop by here on the way to family in NY. Our first time was after my wife ran the Boston Marathon. They are friendly and never disappoint."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the area. We have tried the pizza and subs and they are better than others in the area. I love the salads. They really over deliver. The house dressing is delicious. We have been there 4 times so far. Tonight our order got messed up. The manager did a great job getting it fixed up quickly. I appreciated that and it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I love coming here with friends and family.  They have great wings and pizza here. You get the best experience eating in because the pizza tastes best fresh hot out of the oven.    I have had the salads, wings and pizza here. I always order the sausage and pepperoni pizza. The crust is not too thick and the sauce is not too sweet. They use good quality toppings.  The wings are baked and not fried so they come out super tender."}
{"text":"Hi. Hello. Just wondering what makes the pizza a Detroit Pan Pizza? Is it sauce on top?! My family is from Detroit. So I think it's similar to Louis Pizza?? I am analyzing my food too much.   It wasn't bad! Kinda salty. The regular medium pizza we also got was not the best crust. It by no means tasted bad or was cooked poorly, it just didn't WOW me. Kinda fluffy. When it comes down to it, they won't be replacing my go-to local pizza place.    For those out there who care: it is not a sweet red sauce."}
{"text":"Saw a friend having checked in & saw pictures of their food looked good so my brother & I decided to get 3 pies, 1 sausage/pepperoni, 1 double pepperoni & 1 ham/pepperoni, special going on a medium 2 toppings for $10- not bad, the dough was fine, was very inconsistent with the sauces 2 out of the 3 pies sauce was very minimal the 3rd was saucy, sauce tasted to sweet for my liking, the double pepperoni looked like it was a 1 item pizza. Fairly good amount of cheese, ham/pepperoni saved the pizza for me, would I go back? Maybe if I was hungry, no other place around[closed] & if someone else paid for it.           My suggestion would, be more consistent with sauce, not sure how it's measured but maybe if they used the same ladle or cup size & of it's double portion of a topping add double..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the baked garlic Parmesan wings and the pizza is (to my taste) best in Strongsville. We will be back to do it again to verify our opinion."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and got a coupon in the Welcome Wagon mailer, so we tried it yesterday. The About Us section on the website is an interesting read. Some of the years-old reviews below may be from a previous growth spurt that didn't work out well?  The people behind the counter were friendly and efficient. The pizza was very good, pizza-flavored pizza (I'm not big on non-traditional toppings, IMO those should be named something other than \"pizza\"). Good sauce, generous toppings, fresh veggies, great crust. Was good cold for breakfast, too!  The strip mall they're in is very old school with an alarmingly cratered and narrow lot. But I'll be back."}
{"text":"Dont listen to any of neg. Reviews one of the best pizzas around you would have to drive 20 miles to get anything close."}
{"text":"Super happy with Master Pizza and their customer service.  I got hung up at the dentist office with some really bad news (financially too) and was late to pick up my pizza (by almost an hour).  When I showed up, they advised me that they threw a fresh pie in the oven and it would be up shortly - not only did they throw a fresh one in, but they told me to go ahead and take the other they had been keeping warm.  Talk about putting me in a good mood!  Thank you so much for caring about the quality of the food you guys are sending out of the oven, I continue to be a fan for life."}
{"text":"Called in for a pizza pickup and was told 13 to 20 minutes.  Arrived at Master Pizza 23 minutes later.  Pizza not ready. 43 minutes after it was ordered it came out of the oven.  No apologes, no offer of something to drink while waiting, seems no one cared the order was 23 minutes later.  Will never go to this place again."}
{"text":"On my birthday I got an email saying that as a regular customer I was being given a coupon for a free one item medium pizza. I was amazed as it had been a few years since I ordered a pizza there. I went and redeemed it today. It was delicious- just the right amount of everything! The sausage was delicious and reminds me of Holiday Sausage (a Cleveland Company) which is my favorite. Both young men working were very nice, and I was thrilled to find out that they deliver to Hudson.  I will certainly be a regular now. Great Marketing and Great Pizza!"}
{"text":"Masters pizza has some of the best pizza in Cleveland. They is a traditional pizza shop. It isn't great as a \"restaurant \". They have tables inside but not many. Take out is great though. I know many people who are willing to drive quite a while to get their pizza here."}
{"text":"When I moved to Twinsburg I gave them a try. Very good pizza and friendly owner. I have only ordered my pizza from them since moving here."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed. I called in an hour before my party of 8 arrived. I gave them my order over the phone. I've never been to this place before but this place is adorable. They had pushed 2 tables together and our pizza and drinks were set ready on the table. The pizza taste great if you like thick crust with perfect amount of toppings. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Historically this has been my go to place... Love their spaghetti and pizza. On a recent visit however, I ordered my usual spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs were obviously frozen and the sauce was bitter. My friend ordered a chicken parm sandwich and the chicken is frozen as well. Very disappointing experience. If you're going to Master's only order the pizza."}
{"text":"Good, but not great. I went here after my friends and I saw this pizza shop had received national attention on clevescene.com. We ordered the master Popeye and master deluxe pizzas. They were okay, but not worthy of national recognition, from our opinions. It could have been that we had anticipated this pizza to be so amazing, and then it was sort of a letdown. We stayed there to eat. There was a large party in the dining area. One of the party members was throwing spitballs, that I had been hit by accidentally. When I looked up to see what happened, he started talking about how I was staring at him, pretty loudly. This knocked the experience down another star for me. I know this place has multiple locations, so maybe the pizza and experience could have been better a different location. I know I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. Overpriced food and careless staff. There are many better options."}
{"text":"My co-workers treated me to Master Pizza this week for lunch.  They even called our order in ahead so it would be ready when we got there.  Upon arrival, we were promptly seated and a few minutes later, our salad arrived.  The salad and dressing were very tasty and there was a lot of it.  A few minutes later, the pizza arrived.  It looked and smelled wonderful!  The pizza was not too thick and it had the right balance between dough and toppings.  The pepperoni was fresh and the pizza was delicious!    The service was excellent.  I am looking forward to visiting again to try a calzone and other pizzas.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered some Master Pizza delivery recently at my new house in Medina. I've got a lot of food to try in my new neighborhood.   The pizza was pretty good. We chose Master Pizza because it is the closest pizza shop to our new home. We ordered a cheese pizza for the kids, which they liked. For us, we ordered black olives, onions, and green peppers. The pizza had less cheese and toppings than I would have preferred, but it was pretty tasty.  Will this be our go to pizza spot? Probably because it is close. If I find a Marco's nearby, that will be our go to pizza shop, however.  So much food, so little time!"}
{"text":"Their Detroit style pizza was fantastic!  Great crust, plenty of toppings, good cheese, pretty good sauce.  Would have been 5 stars except we ordered \"lightly sauced\" and it almost seems as if they put extra sauce.  The thing was covered!"}
{"text":"My last pit stop in cleveland. I was craving some pizza before my flight out.. and I grew up on master pizza over in mayfield.. so I figured I'd give this one a try.   A small cheese pizza was $8 and 6 slices. Tasted just about as good as I remember and served hot.. even with my pick up order. The only reason for a one star deduction is now that I have experienced a lot more pizza in my life as opposed to 10 years ago, I realize master pizza is good.. but it certainly does not qualify a 5 star rating compared to other pizza places around the country because there is nothing that makes it stand apart from any other place is the north east Ohio area."}
{"text":"I was amazed when I found positive reviews on Yelp for this pizza joint. What first turned me off was that my fork and knife were not entirely clean and I had to request a new set. The \"house salad\" was a mound of lettuce, cheese, and 4 pepperoni slices, which I took off, so basically cheese and lettuce. The pizza was nothing great either. But to make things even worse we sat across from the kitchen and I could see people preparing food with NO GLOVES on and that it what I disliked the most.. Will never return"}
{"text":"Had a quick day trip to Cleveland, wanted pizza or pasta. Reviews for this place checked out so I walked in the place an order. I was treated quickly and given a few suggestions. I end up going with a small Philly Calzone. Within 15/20 min my food was ready, food was fresh and delicious. The bread was tasty and seasoned well, it was full of lots of peppers and onions. It also came with a side or ranch and marinara which I didn't end up using much of due to the taste of the food. I would def go back again for pizza :)"}
{"text":"Just going off Matthew M's review, this place is bout it bout it. There was a Master Pizza in Lakewood growing up. I always liked the logo. It is like an Italian dude in a cowboy stance popping his collar. One of my friend's thought it was great when we were kids. A friend at work said he would eat this pizza with his wife when she was going to doctor visits on the east side. We ate it for lunch today. It is Friday in lent so people didn't want to eat it because it has meat on it. So the cleaning lady just came by my cubilcle and offered the scraps! So happy about this! It is all mine! I will use this later after having a few beers so I don't get a hangover! Hooray for Master Pizza! I really think it deserves 3 stars. This is a situational review."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza shop. The pizza is always good , And love their white pizza. My office has made this one of our go to places for party luncheons as they'll deliver.  They have a good salad, too."}
{"text":"This is one of the better pizza options in Chagrin Falls.   The service is good and the people are friendly.  They are a good addition to Chagrin Falls.   Sometimes the pizza is pretty greasy, which is the only negative I can say.    They also have the real Coke, that has sugar, not High fructose corn syrup, which is almost impossible to find."}
{"text":"With a million pizza joints on Mayfield road and in surrounding neighborhoods, Master Pizza is the one we choose more than anyone else.  Their online ordering is great, and they automatically keep track of  your ordering, keeping \"rewards points\" for you.  Every buck spent is a point, and when you reach 100 points, you receive a free one topping large pizza.  I order for home and for work events, so I accumulate points rapidly.  As far as the food goes, I have to admit I don't know the menu that well besides the pizza and the breadsticks with cheese.  I have heard its good, but I stick to what I like here.  The pizza is a solid pizza.  When out of the area friends try it, they always tell me how great they find it.  I really like the sausage (huge chunks) and pepperoni.  The also feature a very good white pizza called \"The Popeye\" consisting of a garlic white sauce, spinach (go figure considering the name), tomatoes, and artichoke hearts.  We mix this in the order often.   One amazing new addition is their new \"Detroit Style\" pizza.  A square thick crust pizza with the red sauce baked on top of the pie, with a crispy caramelized cheese crust that is amazing.   Crazy filling!  One last pizza tip, if you need to order a sheet pizza, do it from Master.  Most sheet pizzas are garbage, but this one is A-OK!  I order two cheese sheets to feed 20 middle schoolers, and they love it.  The breadsticks with cheese are very good, and their house salad with the provolone cheese on it and house italian is also included in most of our orders.  They have a generous deliver area, and a small dining room if you want to order in house.  All in all, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and the food has been outstanding each time.    I believe they have some of the best wings in town. They are crispy, meaty and cooked to perfection.    The pizza is light but filling. The sauce is sweet but not overpowering. And the toppings are the right amount to provide a wonderful balance.   When dinning in I recommend placing your order before arriving.     The service is pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Delivery is on time. Also recommend getting the wings, they are tasty. Any app on the menu is great actually. I am a regular customer and will continue to be!"}
{"text":"I can't understand all these 5 star reviews... this place is so inconsistent... The first time my family and I ordered three small pizzas... they messed up the toppings on two of the three pizzas and acknowledged it but they were too \"busy\" too fix the pizzas or the check.. it was really unbelievable.. (i've worked in the service industry my whole life so when I say unbelievable I really mean UNBELIEVABLE)   I was always a huge fan of the barbecue chicken pizza... We ordered a large last night (after I raved and talked everyone into it) and I've never had worse pizza... it was awful and out of 7 people it was hardly touched... VERY INCONSISTENT and smothered in BBQ sauce so much that it was soggy..  We also ordered Togo two large house salads and I they gave us enough dressing for a piece of lettuce... literally nobody had dressing for their salads last night!!! totally disappointing I'd find better pizza and service elsewhere"}
{"text":"Really good pizza lots of toppings! Wish it wasn't so far away this would be a regular spot"}
{"text":"Really good pizza even though I asked for no mushrooms and they were on the pizza anyway. Still 5 stars because it's really good. Better than the chains for sure."}
