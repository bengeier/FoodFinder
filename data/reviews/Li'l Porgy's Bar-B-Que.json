{"text":"Little porgy's is the best bbq restaurant in town! Love their xtra hot sauce! Love their ribs and chicken!"}
{"text":"A for food speed  but F for everything else.  This place is really disappointing. They drench the ribs in sauce and after going knee deep in it you have to arm wrestle the ribs to separate them. My friend also got the rib tips and was sick afterwards..."}
{"text":"Not happy about this. I've always wanted to try this place and finally talked my husband into trying it and was that a mistake. The ribs were tougher than beef jerky. Can't even believe how bad. Don't recommend the ribs. The pork sandwich was ok but I thought it would be pulled pork - NOT. Sauce wasn't great. To much cinnamon added to it."}
{"text":"The sauce is tasty and even the mixed sauce has quite a kick to it which I love. It came with bread and fries which are also great with the sauce.  Lemon shake-up wasn't good though, I was expected a refreshing drink to go along with the yummy spicy ribs but it was wayyyy too sweet and tasted really artificial. Other than that, I would highly recommend this place. Great value too!"}
{"text":"Never been to the actual restaurant, but would always eat if they catered at Assembly Hall or BIF. Standard fast-food BBQ."}
{"text":"Maybe the meat is good, but I could not tell because the sauce is disgusting. I might try it again someday without the sauce, but I doubt it."}
{"text":"I had ribs from this place once and was just disgusted by their meat quality...  and it smells so good from the outside since they cook with wood, as their sign says.  But man, the quality of their meat is terrible and it is disgustingly greasy.  Given how people praise this place I then tried it *again* and it was just as terrible.  This is one of those places I just do not get.  It grossed me out."}
{"text":"Yum...pork sandwich extra hot...extra good...just back to CU for a visit and have not had Lil Porgy's for over 20 years...looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"For a while, my girlfriend and I got Lil Porgies every week on Sunday, for the half chicken special.  We would usually get two meals each from it - between the chicken, lemon shake-up, and fries.  They even got to know us on sight here, which was pretty cool.  This place is the best barbecue in town when it comes to ribs (both beef and pork) and chicken.  The meat is pretty much always falling off the bone tender and the sauce is very tasty - a little sweet and a little spicy, especially if you get the mixed.  (The other options are mild, hot, and extra hot.)  I'm not as big a fan of the sandwiches because the bread gets kind of mushy with the sauce, but if you don't mind that, it's still the same tasty meat and sauce combination.  For sandwiches I actually kind of prefer Black Dog, but Lil Porgies is king for ribs and chicken.  Always tender and  with that tasty wood smoke flavor.  Just going into the delicious smelling store will make your mouth water.  I have had many, many meals here and it always hits the spot.  The service is great for a no-frills barbecue type place, and as I said, they remember the regulars.  I can't comment on the fried shrimp or fish, because why would I get that at a barbecue place?  Most people get their food and take it home to eat - probably partly because they give you so much sauce, you will make a mess.  But there is a lot of seating available, and this location looks less dodgy on the outside than the Urbana one.  They also sell the barbecue sauce they use, either by the cup or by the quart for very reasonable prices.  Makes great barbecue pizza at home.  Now we've moved across town, but fortunately we're still close to the other Lil Porgies in Urbana."}
{"text":"I knew of Li'l Porgy's before moving to California 30 years ago, but never tried their BBQ. My great loss. Good friend treated me to lunch at Porgy's during my visit last summer. I don't remember the sides, but my beef sandwich was delicious, and best beef bbq sandwich of all, that my memory can recall. Price is right, interior is clean, seating comfortable and reasonable portion. Perhaps 5 stars is high for one visit and one menu item, but would be unfair to Porgy's to defer higher rating until next visit.   Wish there was a Li'l Porgy's in OC or Long Beach."}
{"text":"It's such a shame that Li'l Porgy's isn't closer to campus. I always have a craving for their chicken sandwiches. The BBQ sauces are so delicious (ask for the sauce on the side). I love the smoky flavors in the meat. The lemon shakeup is perfect drink for any meal. There's a different deal everyday so I can always get reasonably priced food. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Chicago BBQ joint yet that has topped the mixed sauce at Lil' Porgy's. God, if it wouldn't burn my nostrils or cause an aneurysm I would be snorting or intravenously tapped on the sauce - all the time. I know some might argue that there's some better BBQ up here in Chicago, but well - I suppose everyone has their own BBQ preference and mine happens to be Lil' Porgy's. Their cooking is so good because they cook on wood too. That's important to note. I am drooling on my keyboard thinking about it I better get off this review before I short something out."}
{"text":"You have to go on Sunday and get the half chicken deal. For six dollars you get a half chicken and a large drink. This is probably the best deal offered in Chambana. For the amount of food you get, this is a steal. You can never go wrong with Lil' Porgy's. Their rib tips are very good too. Very comparable to any bbq joint..way better than memphis dry rub ribs. The sauce is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Porgy's was for a long time the only place I knew of in CU to get a BBQ fix. Now, there are much better options such as Black Dog Smoke & Ale House. Porgy's smells great, but food just doesn't satisfy."}
{"text":"It's hit and miss with this place! At times there is meat on the bone and then at times it's all bone! When there is meat though it's GREAT! Plus I really enjoy their lemon shake-ups. If you feel lucky I recommend it unfortunately to often I don't! Haha"}
{"text":"This is the place to come if you like a disgusting amount of fat on your brisket.  Hopefully the pork is better but I doubt it I know I won't be trying it."}
{"text":"I might be the only vegetarian to write a review for this place... but really... it's f'n rad.  i don't eat meat... but this place smells divine.  i stopped in one day to see what they offered, and they had fresh corn on the cob... and probably the best french fries i've eaten in a long time.  they come drenched in bbq sauce.  holy awesome.  the guy who runs the register is about the nicest guy around.  i just buy the bbq sauce (half hot, half mild) and use it at home for grilling my vegetarian options.    i can't give it five stars, because i've never actually eaten the things it's presumably well known for... a variety of meats, smoked and bbq'ed."}
{"text":"Awesome local rib joint.  nothing fancy, good food. their sauce is to kill for on ribs/tips and chicken.  they stand n par w best places from KC, memphis, st louis and hands donw better than all other ribs joints in near by chicago (except for smoque). Totally agree w Gary W and the sauce has a bit of bite to it as well. Maybe not for people who don't like spicy bbq sauce but I love it.  I can speak much for service since it's not a full service restaurant but people over the counter are usually friendly.  not a good place for a first half a dozen date, unless u r low on budget students from parkland or uiuc.  it's just good food, if that's important, it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"I\"d suck their sauce from a pile of leaves, and still give it two stars.  I grew up in Champaign and Li'l Porgy's was always hands down the best.  These days, dry tough chicken, 70% bone on the large tips.  The only thing that holds up is the Polish.  Which I religiously get once a month.  Love the Polish.   For whatever reason, when I get my Polish and Large Tips at the Urbana location, it seems to kick but....  in the yummy department.  Please give love a care to the chicken again Porgys."}
{"text":"A quick history lesson: I'd heard Li'l Porgy's name many times over the years as I would hear their commercials on 98.3 The Whip.  I'd first stumbled across this wonderful radio station on a drive through central IL and for a few years after I regularly tuned to the internet feed while I was at work, listening to Lonesome Larry in the mornings with the occasional spot saying \"Good Because We Cook On Wood.\"  Fast forward a few years and I found myself in Champaign-Urbana proper for the first time.  A group of friends and I made the drive down from Madison to catch the football game and tailgate with some other friends coming down from Chicago.  As we drove into town that morning we passed by Li'l Porgy's and one of my friends pointed it out, saying she'd read a few good reviews.  This triggered my memories of the radio spots and I knew I had to make this happen.  And later that day we found ourselves leaving Memorial Stadium victorious and in need of sustenance.  The Chicago contingent went back to their hotel and we prepared to grab a late afternoon meal.  I lobbied hard for some BBQ before we went back to Wisconsin and won over the doubters - we were going to Li'l Porgy's.  We parked in the lot, savored the wood smoke in the air then made our way in the unassuming building.  I didn't know what to expect but we quickly caught our bearings and queued up at the counter.  I went with the daily special, which was a half slab for a dollar off.  I placed my order and went with the hot variant of their acclaimed sauce.  We claimed a table and a few minutes later my number was called.  The ribs came in a basket lined with tin foil, piping hot with a cup of water on the side.  The steak fries were perfectly crisp and the ribs were well done.  The sauce was the star of the show, perfectly spicy and tangy with a great heat I felt on my lips for the next hour.  I used most of the fries to sop up any excess sauce and I kind of regret not buying a bottle to take with me.  Fortunately I was wearing red so the sauce I spilled didn't stick out too badly.     It would be disingenuous for me to claim that these were the best ribs I've ever had; that honor still belongs to Baumgartner's in Monroe.  The quality of the meat was a notch below great, as there was a bit of toughness to deal with and a bit of gristle hadn't been trimmed.  The value was excellent; $8 for a half slab is a great deal.  The ambiance is wonderful in a hole-in-the-wall BBQ joint kind of way.  I was completely satisfied and everyone in our group seemed to feel the same.  Thirty minutes after we'd walked in we found ourselves back on the road north.  It had been a fun day and Li'l Porgy's was a great way to cap it off."}
{"text":"When in town, always like to check out BBQ joints. Looks good, smelled great. They claim their bbq is good, cause its cooked on wood.   Got the pork sandwich with \"mix\" sauce. Sauce was like eating a spicy ham glaze. Full of allspice and cinnamon. And a bit of clove. Really weird.  The pork. Well, they claims its cooked over wood, but this wasn't...the closest it came to wood was the crate it shipped in.  Got one piece not covered in sauce, no real flavor...def NO smoke/BBQ flavor.  Under the sandwich was about a 1/4\" of clearish liquid...maybe au jus?    This was nothing more than pre cooked pork, maybe not even cooked onside, with a strange sauce on it. Just terrible. Should be ashamed to call themselves a BBQ joint."}
{"text":"I'm just going to say this.. this BBQ place would be a three star place but their sauce makes it a 5 star place! It is my favorite BBQ sauce I've ever had..  lil porgys is my fav BBQ place although a lot of people will say black dogs is, their sauces do not come close to lil porgys sauce..  lil porgys is cheap and the best thing to get is the tub o tips and get the sauce on the side because if they pour it on the food it will mix with the greasy ribs and not be as good.. trust me!!! Also the people are cheap as hell giving the sauce on the side and pouring it on anything but on the tub of tips they literally give you a small sized sofa cup full of sauce so you will have more than enough! My fav BBQ place of all time! The quality of the food is pretty greasy and bad compared to other BBQ places but idc because that sauce is magic and makes me forget!"}
{"text":"I LOVE L'il Porgy's. There, I said it.  Here's why:  1. Unpretentious, Ma n Pa style joint..no glossy printed menus or overpriced and over-hyped product.  2. CHEAP. Reasonable prices! They have daily specials... most under $5!  3. FAST. Whether you order in or to go, you will most likely only wait 3 minutes at the most.   4. DELICIOUS. Really tasty, well-cooked food.  I think overall it's the best BBQ in C-U."}
{"text":"Always come here for the half chicken meal on sundays. I never order anything else because I don't need to order anything else. After a heavy dose of fight training and going out on saturdays, a sunday trip to this place tastes amazing. Great sauce and the chicken is smoked and cooked very well. Service is very fast too."}
{"text":"I don't know better BBQ in Champaign-Urbana.   I always get the charred rib tips with the mild sauce, and a lemon shake-up. It usually comes with fries and slices of white bread - unnecessary, really, but can be a nice palate cleanser in between all that meat and tangy sauce. I wouldn't recommend the corn - it's usually a bit soggy.   Get Li'l Porgy's to go, for a picnic or a potluck, or better yet, bring it straight home so you don't have to share it with anyone else. Since I left town, I always think about this place whenever I smell BBQ or someone outside grilling."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the chicken and ribs combo with the mix sauce. Great portions and great flavor. I wish they put the steak fries separately though because they were completely soggy from the bbq sauce. I was also surprised that I enjoyed the sauce so much because I was raised on sweet baby rays which is a little sweeter. Perfect for a hearty lunch!"}
{"text":"I don't know what compelled me to go back - but I love barbecue.  Got the brisket sandwich - soggy tasteless watery meat. It's not barbeque."}
{"text":"Good Q, and love that sauce!!! It's kinda hit n miss on the rib tips..have had a good meaty portion, and the next time I got bombed with burnt ends. The portion size is nice for the money. They need to ad cold beer to the menu...what's Q without a brew? Overall , it's worth a visit!!!"}
{"text":"I love little porkies every time I go it's delicious and it is cooked on wood. I've had everything there all been good I get the mix sauce just the right amount of spice heat. Daily special every day it's well worth the money"}
{"text":"Love this place. Sunday tradition for the half chicken. The sauce  and smell of this place takes me back to my childhood. Meat is occasionally dry/overcooked but the other 9 out of 10 times it is exactly what I need."}
{"text":"Look, Li'l Porgy's is perfectly adequate barbecue. But the people saying that it's the best in town are absolutely insane. If you're looking for the best barbecue, you need to be looking at Black Dog, which has made national press for its quality.   If you go to Li'l Porgy's you're going to have perfectly fine barbecue. There won't be a wait, and you're not going to wind up breaking the bank. But please don't go in there expecting the best this town has to offer, because it's not even close to the same quality. It's like comparing a Steak 'n Shake burger to a filet mignon."}
{"text":"awesome BBQ! We visited for the first time last Saturday. My only issue was the dine in area."}
{"text":"The fries and lemon shakeup were the highlight of the meal. The ribs left more to be desired. Tough as well done sirloin, the sauce is eh. I wish I had a bowl of fries then the ribs itself. Tried once, won't go back again..."}
{"text":"I'll take Li'l Porgy's over factory BBQ any day of the week. And I'll certainly take it over some schmengy As Seen On TV sandwich shop, that's for sure. Not that I'm drinking the chain haterade, but this place has personality just oozing out of every crack and crevice, much like the smoke that fills the air each day.  The Yelp app led me here, and I ordered a brisket sandwich with a few sides (slaw and beans) and of course they include that crisp pickle spear in the order. Yessir.  So let's begin with the order itself. You walk in, and immediately it's a wave of smoke and fry scent. I smelled like Porgy's all afternoon (you're just going to need to wash your clothes later) but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Just know before you go. The nice woman at the register took my order while shouting it out to the people in the kitchen, and you slide down to the counter to pick it up. Lightning fast! That's the beauty of BBQ--all the prep is done beforehand and then you just sling it out (with love, of course) to waiting customers.  Sling they did, and I went to sit down with my food and my strawberry soda. STRAWBERRY SODA! I don't usually love it, but there's something that happened when it mixed with BBQ and I honestly don't know if I'll ever try BBQ without it again. Trust.  The food was okay--unfortunately the brisket had been holding wet (in water, maybe?) and when they put it on the light bun for the sandwich, it got soggy pretty quick. Maybe avoid the sandwich and get it as a meat plate? The sides were fine. My socks were not knocked anywhere, but I did enjoy them. Pickle win. All in all, a nice lunch from nice local folks."}
{"text":"Lil porky's is more than a great restaurant it's that business you frequent whether you're a local or a tourist.  The rib tips are always tender, the chicken is never dry, and did I already mention they have tender beef brisket and Heinkels Polish!  The sauce should be a state treasure, it's distinct sweet and flavorful taste will have you asking for a bottle to take home.  Now we get to the beverages...they have lemon shake ups on deck!  This beverage normally found at fairs and theme parks is available at lil porky's everyday as well as strawberry soda.  Need I say more? Nah B"}
{"text":"Aright barbecue, I've tasted better. Sunday's special is the 1/2 chicken, fried, and lemon shakeup, the only thing I ever order at the porgys champaign location. All that is less than $6 every Sunday, and it fills me up as much if not more than a chipotle burrito  and Always get sauce on the side!"}
{"text":"It's delicious. I usually get a \"pork sandwich\" @ $4.90, which I believe is a  bit pricey for what it is.. if it was around $4.00 that would be perfect..   Their sauces are crazy good.. I get \"mix\" and I'm sniffling like a baby. Although, I'm a bit sensitive to spiciness. (I can eat Shin Ramyun just fine, but anything spicier than that is 'painful' for me :( )  I recommend their: ribs, rib tips, half chicken, chicken/rib combo & pork sandwich. (i am not familiar with the rest of their menu)  I've also gotten a \"strawberry-lemon shake-up\" which I'm not sure is actually listed on the menu.. but they make it. It's sweet, but less sweet/sour than the regular lemon shake-up. However, I do feel that they both are pretty excessive in terms of calories, sugar.. so unless you don't care, I'd just stick to water/soda/tea."}
{"text":"Every time I visit C-U, we have to stop here.  Usually its for the Sunday special - the 1/2 Chicken.  On Sunday, it still comes with a large drink - still (Aug. 2013) for $5.  Amazing!  And it still is moist and tender while fully cooked (no pink meat here!).  Two slices of white bread come with it to sop up the sauce you might leave.  The place looks dirty to some, but it isn't - it's just the original paint and seating as it was when it opened.  The staff is friendly and they serve it up fast.  Try the hot BBQ sauce - it is hot enough without being dangerous."}
{"text":"This place is the very definition of a hole-in-the-wall sort of restaurant. It's fairly small, looks a bit dingy and might not be the first place you'd stop if you were just passing through. But it's always busy at lunchtime. The reason is the food. Who needs ambiance when you're serving up a BBQ sauce this good?  I'll say I wasn't a huge fan of their ribs, but that's just because I like them cooked a certain way so the texture was a bit off for me. But the taste is spot-on so I usually go for their chicken. They have a Sunday Special that is a GREAT deal with a huge portion of chicken, fries and toast for an incredible price. I like to get the \"Mix\" sauce that's a mix of their spicy sauce and their non-spicy sauce and to me it's just right. There's a ton of depth of flavor to the sauce (and cinnamon, I think!) that gives it a really unique flavor. Recommended."}
{"text":"Went well off my route to try Li'l Porky's so really needed it to live up to the five star reviews.  It satisfied and I'd try it again if only to give it another chance to make five stars.  It was so close.  The ribs were just a tad over cooked, which gave a chewy crispness to the outside that wonderfully balanced the juicy, tender and smoky inside. But, with more chew than juice over four bones my jaws got a workout I'm not accustomed to with slow-cooked meat.  Typically, Li'l Porky's serves its ribs wet with your sauce choice. I had the original mild sauce on the side. It was moanin' good sauce--sweet with a bit of tang. You'll want to ask for extra--in a large cup--to take home.  Creamy Cole slaw and crispy/fluffy steak fries were the perfect BBQ sides.  Add a medium soft drink that anywhere else would be a large and you're looking at a terrific value at $11.  Final note: The ribs were meaty but had the smallest bones I'd ever seen--about 3/8\" across and, with the tips, 6-7\" long. I asked what kind of pigs they used (potbellied?) and was told they get ribs from various places, which sometimes means larger bones or fattier ribs. That kind of inconsistency could affect cooking and quality, and maybe account for the varied results among reviewers."}
{"text":"A big YUM!  Not the fanciest place in Champaign - but the prices are very reasonable and the food is enjoyable.  The ribs are lean and the saucy is messy.  The sauces have the Southern smokey thing going on - and it seems to be a hit as this place has been around quite a while.  Each day has a special that saves you a bit of money - then - the prices are very reasonable.  Make sure you get plenty of napkins!!!"}
{"text":"The Sunday Special is an amazing deal. Half a chicken + steak fries + 2 slices of bread + large drink (I recommend the lemon shake-up!). Tastes great and it's all for just $5.70 (tax included).  Rib tips are also delicious!"}
{"text":"I ate here about 7 years ago and it was so horrible that I haven't been back until recently. I ordered pick up for 7 people and it sucked. Wow. Nobody are their food and everyone complained about how dry the meats (pork, ribs, brisket) were. The sauce is mediocre. I'd prefer store bought over what they offer. I'm going back on another 7 year hiatus. This was so bad, McDonald's would have been a better option."}
{"text":"Half slab with fries and mix sauce. Just great except for the toast could be more crispy."}
{"text":"Pork sandwich was pretty good.   Corn on the cob was a bit mushy.  Very friendly courteous staff.  Quick service."}
{"text":"A-OK grade (better than middle of the road, but not by much)  Pros: The beef brisket sandwich was the Wednesday special tonight and the meat was on point, juicy (maybe even succulent) and a decent portion as to not overhang the sandwich, but not feeling ripped off. I know it's not always important, but the dudes that took my order (white guy with dark hair and a beard) and the guy that served the food (hispanic guy, clean shaven) were really helpful and nice.  Plenty of parking and there was about 10 cars ~6:30pm, so busy enough to know it's a place people actually go (I'm new to Champaign). Hot sauce was the perfect amount of hot for me. I needed a sip every so often, but never got too hot. Location and easy access to the roadway, plus it's ~5min driving from my place. Seasonal Turkey legs? Sounds bomb... I'm almost wishing I got that just cause it's a novelty and my Disneyland experience wasn't the same without one. The lemon drink is just lemonade. For whatever reason I was imagining a lemon slushy or something with everyone's reviews of it. It's good and a good balance of sweet/tart, leaning on the sweet side. Worth the buck.25 for a small ($1.75 for a medium).  Cons: Fries would be good if they weren't soggy from being wrapped in everything (sauce, humidity from sandwich, a little grease). (May not be a Con) Small dining space, but I'm not sure if I saw some more room off to the side. Sauce... man, everyone was shouting about the sauce and it was def subpar for me, and I didn't expect too much, tried to keep my expectations to a minimum. It's definitely a strong, hot-sauce (dark, almost chipotle-y though, not vinegary like typically imagined) style bbq, but I just wasn't diggin it. I wouldn't call it smoky, hearty, sweet, just don't know how to describe it better. Decorations, but whatever, it's a casual man cave that's spruced up for the handful of people that probably care enough.  Will I go back? Yeah, probably get something different or at the very least a different sauce (sauces are the same flavor, just different amounts of heat) or no sauce. Order something that doesn't come with fries or ask for a different side to replace em. But I'm gonna check out the other BBQ places in town before I get back here.  Black Dog seems to set the bar here, so I'll try it toward the end. Remember this is decently priced BBQ and it's good meat, so it's worth a try. I would probably choose the Hickory River for the Nachos and this place for the Brisket."}
{"text":"This place had me fooled.  I was slapped in the face with the tantalizing aroma of wood-fired smoke, and I thought for sure I was in store for a treat.  Based on the reviews, I feel like this sensation has fooled many.  I ordered the pork sandwich, expecting tender and moist \"pulled\" pork drenched in BBQ sauce.  What I got was tough pork \"slices\" on a crappy bun with decent BBQ sauce (I ordered the \"mix\" which was definitely on the spicy side).  I also came with about 10 steak fries, which were soggy and bland--you know, that bad kind of fry, borderline too hot to eat on the inside with absolutely no crispiness at all!  AND on top of that, I was suckered by a bright flashy sign advertising their great sweet corn, which was chewy and gross....blah.  About the only item I enjoyed during my lunch was the giant cup of sweet tea.  I'll be the first to admit that I've been spoiled by some outstanding BBQ lately, but Porgy's was not even close...."}
{"text":"Here's another place I'd heard about and decided to stop in for.  It was busy, always a good sign even though I despise waiting in line but for good BBQ?  Absolutely.  I ordered the Chicken and Rib Combo with mild sauce on the side.  Included were fries and white bread.  The place operated like a well-oiled machine and I was in and out in surprising time for the line and the fact it was a Friday night.    The chicken was juicy and well cooked, the ribs were a little tougher than I would have cooked but they had good flavor and texture.  All around a good meal at a great price.  Their sauce was adequate, but I should have gone with something a little more exotic than their standard, that's on me."}
{"text":"Lil Porgy's is dear to my heart. There is not any single restaurant anywhere that I have consistently and repeatedly come to as much as Lil Porgy's. In fact, often when I am asked where to eat, I find it incredibly difficult to think of other places I would want to go to around campus. I've been coming to Lil Porgy's (Champaign one) ever since I came to U of I as a freshman a few years ago. My small group leader brought me after a Sunday service and I fell in love ever since (some advice, on Sundays around 11:30-12:30, there is a huge influx of people from my church during the U of I school year. Sorry that it makes a huge line at times and becomes an inconvenience for others (sometimes they have to make extra chicken), but just some words of advice)). The smell of that real wood they cook on actually fills your car as you near the place and turn into the parking lot. Be warned, some of the smoky goodness may stay in your clothes for awhile, so some people do choose to remove outer layers before entering. I definitely love the price, sauce, food, portion size, staff and the cozy environment. I have tried many menu options but prefer the Sunday Special, ribs (pork and beef) and rib tips. I highly recommend people trying out Porgys, I honestly think their sauce and food grows on you the more you try it, so if you don't like it the first time, I implore you to give it a few more shots to let the Porgy's magic grow into an irresistible craving.   Below are some menu items that I continuously turn back to, along with some advice for how to order and what to expect.  Sunday Special By far the most superior lunch deal compared to any other lunch offering in the greater Champaign-Urbana. The special comes with a medium lemon shake-up. *Note* there are actual lemons in the cup and lemon shake ups do not come with any other special of the week, so if you wanted a drink you'd have to add about $1.50 to each special price; which sets this Sunday Special above the rest. The rest of the special is half a chicken, sauce (either on the food or on the side) two slices of white bread and a side of fries. I recommend getting the sauce on the side, but you have to specifically tell the cashier when you order (you can ask for mild, mixed or hot and I prefer mixed sauce). Sauce on the side comes in a 4 oz container, but it benefits you because it distributes much more evenly across your meal. You can dip into the sauce, compared to having it ladled over everything and letting the sauce slowly accumulate at the bottom of your tray. I will admit, there are weeks where the chicken is not as juicy and the fries aren't always as crispy and fluffy. However, having gone at least 50+ times just for the Sunday Special, overall it has provided juicy and tender meat, crispy and fluffy fries, and a sweet and refreshing lemon shake-up. One last point to consider is that the price has been steadily rising about 10 cents a year, so now it is $5.30 for the special, $5.80 after tax. Still, it is under $6, and I challenge you to find somewhere else that offers as much quantity, quality and value for a lunch meal.   Rib tips (Tub of tips) - this option is pricier, but it comes with 2 pounds of rib tips, a whole tray of fries, 4 slices of bread and an entire PINT of sauce (you need to ask for sauce on the side to get the whole pint I believe). There is no drink included and at the Champaign Porgys water costs 5 cents. But normally this can be adequately split between two people (maybe more if they aren't that hungry). The total would be around 17-18 bucks but between two people it comes down to at the most $9.00. There are a lot of bones in the rib tips, some pieces have a lot of fat as well, and some pieces are really hard, but overall, the meat is soft and full of smoky, porky flavor. It's not a very clean eat, so if those drawbacks aren't what you fancy, you can always consider other options.   Beef Ribs (Friday Special) - This special comes with a great deal of meat. I've only had this special a few times, but each time has been excellent. It comes with 8 beef ribs in two slabs of 4, a side of fries, two slices of bread and sauce for between $7-8. There is no drink included however. I really love beef ribs, though they may be a little tougher than pork ribs (when I had them, they were tender enough) and the sheer quantity of 8 beef ribs made me extremely pleased.   Champaign Vs. Urbana Porgys I have heard from friends that the Champaign Porgys is better for the Sunday Special based the juiciness of the chicken and the taste of the lemon shake up is better compared to the Urbana Porgys. However, the Urbana Porgys seems to offer better quality rib tips.  Lastly, some perks that are really nice about the place:   The dining area is well kept and the staff is friendly. Some of them even joke around, a couple stories to go with that: I once set down my tray of tub of tips and the pint of sauce happened to fall off and crack"}
{"text":"I want this for my last meal.  It's the best food I have ever tasted in my mouth.  I've been coming here all my life.  In high school I used to come here 3 days a week for lunch.  My friend Zac and I would each get two orders of fries, extra hot sauce on the side and a pickle spear.  That was $2.75.  Amazing!  We used the extra quarter from our $3 to buy a handful of Chiclets from the gumball machine.  The rib-tips are better than anywhere else I've ever been.  The fries and lemon shake-ups are amazing too.  The sandwiches are not impressive.  The sauce is.  It's incredible.  They make 200 gallons of the stuff each week.  You can buy it by the pint for less than the cheapest store-bought BBQ sauce.  I've kept Porgy's sauce in a squirt bottle in the refrigerator for 6 months without it going bad.  It's miraculous.  I've eaten the brisket of Texas and the vinegared pork of North Carolina.  I've savored the best meats in Memphis and met Kansas City's Arthur Bryant himself.    Li'l Porgy's is the best barbeque I have ever had."}
{"text":"Oh, god, the ribs here.  I once complained that they were inconsistent - sometimes a little tough, sometimes not.  Well, they fixed whatever little problem they had there.  They are now the perfect texture of insanely tender, but not quite fall off the bone.  Yum.  A generous portion (even the small), the lovely fat and smoke cut by that sweet but hot sauce.  So typical of midwestern barbecue ribs, and Porgy's nails it.  I still come back every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best BBQ in the area, Black Dog is a better option. But nonetheless, this place is pretty great. Food tastes good and it's pretty cheap too. Service is solid and super fast. I recommend you get the sauce on the side because u get more and u can dip ur fries in it. Also potato salad is nice."}
{"text":"This is an established restaurant that I used to hold near and dear. These last two time were major disappointments.   This time I ordered 1/3 slab of ribs with mixed sauce....OVERCOOKED... terribly. Most too hard it hurt my teeth, I couldn't eat it and therefore it was a monumental waste of money. The mixed sauce (between mild and hot) was still so spicy (and I'm not a lightweight) it had no flavor just burn. I wouldn't even dredge the fries in it. I was going to eat it in the restaurant but with no plate to work with it and only two napkins, (I know I could ask for more, but, seriously,it's a BBQ place, napkins should readily be available all over the place) I ended up taking it home. Blech....I made soup.   The best part of the meal...the pickles.  I'm not returning. I hear Black Dog is good. I'll have to try it next time I want BBQ."}
{"text":"The fastest service you will ever experience, and some of the best ribs you can get in champaign. (Tip: Go on a Saturday for the special deal!)"}
{"text":"If you grew up in the Chicago area, you'll know this as \"southside barbecue.\" Big glass smoker front and center, generous portions, lots of locals, order your sauce based on heat level (not some b.s. Fruit ingredient), you'll probably get tips or a hot link. White bread on the side, fries underneath (drenched in sauce).   Basically if you've ever been to Lems or any of the various \"John Doe's Rib House\" kind of places, Lil Porgy's is in that vein. I don't think it's as good as Lems, but if you're living in Champaign, you won't be disappointed.   If you're not from Chicago area, you'll know this as \"not black dog,\" and it may ruin it for you.   Either way, Lil Porgy's is pretty decent in its own right. The portions are good, the sauce is tangy. My only complaint is that the meat can be dry depending on what you get and the time of day.   Otherwise, no complaints. I don't get peoples crying about the dining area. It's a barbecue joint! The idea that you're supposed to be comfortable and pampered while you eat barbecue is silly. Get it to-go then. This is a no frills place and frills aren't missed.   Last word: Solid BBQ."}
{"text":"i give it 4 stars for having daily specials... and the fifth star for having such an amazing sunday special: 1/2 chicken with steak fries and white bread.. your choice of sauce on it or on the side.. and the free drink!  i drool just thinking about it.  definitely the only place around CU that i'd go for bbq!  and you should too!"}
{"text":"Simple bar-b-que, but oh so good.  Have to get it when I am home.  My fave thing to order is the chicken sandwich.  I choose the mix sauce- the right amount of spiciness. Most of the time the amount of sauce is just right, but sometimes I do wish I had a little more.  You can ask for sauce on the side which can help.  The fries are perfect when dipped in the sauce.  Sometimes we will order an extra order of fries to share.  I don't recommend the baked beans- they aren't that great and the serving size is super small.  Plenty of easy parking and you don't have to wait too long to get your order- even when it's pretty large."}
{"text":"Soooo don't get the sandwiches.  Or the shrimp or any crap like that, that's just stuff they have on the menu to please picky eaters.  All you need are the ribs (and maybe the BBQ chicken).  On one of the \"amazing\" days, they are the best ribs I have ever eaten.  Smokey, saucey, and falling off the bone.  On one of the \"good\" days they are still pretty darn great."}
{"text":"Tub of tips is our tradition when visiting Champaign.  Mixed sauce for the ribs and fries, perfect!"}
{"text":"I'll tell you what, BBQ food generally gets expensive for me and RON bear. Once the taste of slow smoke hits our lips, we tend to take as much meat in our mouths as we can. This place had more meat than the two of us could imaginable handle, and when you top it off with any of the sauces, it's a memorable finish.   Rib tips: DOPE  Sanniches (we got all kinds): DANK   you can't go wrong... this place is tits"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Had the pork sandwich. Awesome BBQ. Awesome sauce also had the home made lemonade. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm from the south so I consider myself to be a pretty good judge of BBQ. This was good BBQ."}
{"text":"I went in to Li'l Porgy's with very high hopes.  It has been rated #1 BBQ in C-U for a number of years by several area publications... are these people on crack?    I went the other day with a few friends of mine.  I saw the shack and as we walked in, no frills, just a simple BBQ hole-in-the-wall.  But see I saw this as promising, because good BBQ doesn't come from a fancy place.    The staff was slightly hard to understand, but took my order.  There's no table service, but I didn't expect that.  I ordered a half-rack with a catfish sandwich and fries.  I was very disappointed.  That fish sandwich came out of someone's freezer.  Literally it was a fried fish patty in a bun.  TADA!    My ribs were less than pleasing.  The bones were everywhere; they gave me the crappiest slab of ribs.  The sauce tastes like apple (honestly, just not my favorite).  Fries come with every meal, you know like ten fries.  Haha and they had the audacity to put my fries underneath my ribs to smother them in the awful sauce and"}
{"text":"Never thought of myself as a BBQ fanatic until I found Porgy's! Such a hidden gem in the C/U area! I get the rib tips every time and they're amazing! So soft and tender! Definitely beats paying $10+ ordering rib tips from Blackdog or any other BBQ place. Not to mention, you get an order of fries and a slice of bread with every entree! They also have amazing daily specials. My boyfriend visits every single Sunday for their 1/2 chicken special. Half a chicken, side of fries, two slices of bread, and a large drink all for $5.40! You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, its kinda gone downhill a little over the years. Still good. But not as good as I remember... not only in the taste but also in the service..."}
{"text":"Dang.. this first bbq place I visited in Champaign IL definitely set the bar high with its chicken BBQ deal on sundays... They have half chicken deal for $5 and they give plenty of food. I believe any dish you order - except for the side dishes - comes with thick cut fries and a two pieces of simple toast bread. I really wanted to try their corns but cole slaw won the battle today.   Overall, considering that my order was sitting at the pick-up spot due to my inability to listen for a two digit number, the chicken was still warm, juicy, and tender. And the BBQ sauce is not mind-blowing but great; it was saucy, sweet, little sour, and had mild kick to it. I'm definitely going for the spicier sauce next time."}
{"text":"After moving to Southern California we realized just how amazing Lil Porgys is!!  Great meat that truly gets BBQ'd!  Delicious sauce!    Try it the next time you visit C-U!"}
{"text":"$5 half chicken w/ a free lemon shake up on Sundays...best $5 you can spend on take out in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Always delicious. My favorites are the pork sandwich and half chicken. The mixed sauce is perfect, just the right spiciness. I recommend getting slaw to put on your sandwich, just the right complement to the heat."}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best unknown bbq in the country. Sauces are hand made. Portions are huge. Window smoker in restaurant always causes drooling. Chicken is as good as pulled pork, or even ribs & tips. Also hand made lemonade shakeup are excellent every time. I stop in every time I visit my mom for the past 10-15 years."}
{"text":"Very cheap and local food. 5 dollars you cant even finish. I like the rib tips the best."}
{"text":"Theres no sauce comparable to Porgys BBQ sauce! The meat can be tough sometimes but i usually am satisfied after a meal! It's definitely not the best in town BBQ but the mix BBQ sauce is delish and cheap!"}
{"text":"I am a BBQ fanatic! I love all the different types across the country. With that being said, this place was the WORST \"barbecue\" restaurant I have ever eaten at. The ribs were dry and chewy, the sauce was horrendous and the fries were soggy, but they were the highlight of my meal. The atmosphere was like a prison cafeteria, my wife and I thought we were going to get shanked and robbed, very sketchy place. To this day when I see this place, I get angry. I'd rather eat out of a dumpster behind a good smokehouse..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ place in Champaign-Urbana.  Friday's Rib Special is one of my all time favorites. I stick with the Mild sauce and I have never found a BBQ sauce that I like more than Li'l Porgy's!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this little location claimed my heart, but the amazing bbq certainly had a big part in it.  An initial glance, and it's very unassuming, but all hidden gems are like that.  I always get the 1/2 Chicken or Rib Tips, both Spicy.  Perfect meal and it comes with steak fries  as a side which are great with the sauce.  I've tried the lemon shakeup multiple times and it goes great with the bbq."}
{"text":"Sadly, I discovered Lil Porgy's months after I graduated on a random trip to my alma mater. This is one of those \"diamond in the rough\"s you don't want to miss out on. I've only been on Sunday because, let's be serious, who can say no to half a chicken, bread, fries, AND a drink for about 5 bucks? Not me, that's for sure. Plus, I'm little so it's more like 2 meals in one for 5 bucks. Beautiful. I'm a big advocate for the mild sauce over the hot - it's sweet and packed with flavor.  The potato salad also won't disappoint, especially if you're a potato salad fanatic like me who must order it anywhere it's available. I'll definitely be making my way back next time in Champaign- I'll try to avoid Sundays so maybe I can give some of the other things on their menu a try."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their sauce or the meat, my wife likes their rib tips with no sauce. Fries are ok, service a little gruff but ok."}
{"text":"Growing up, Porgy's was the first bbq I was ever really exposed to. I can remember being a tiny kid and my pops giving each of my siblings half of a sandwich (..we were small, not underfed) and a little cup of extra sauce. Maybe that makes me biased, but for me Porgy's pork sandwich with extra sauce is the quintessential bbq sandwich, and bbq in general is my absolute favorite food.   The pork sandwich. I never really get much else--sometimes chicken or beef if that's what's on special, but always a sandwich, always extra sauce, sometimes extra fries or a slice of white bread, and a lemon shakeup.   We are lucky in Champaign to have a surprisingly great bbq selection. I worked at Black Dog for quite awhile, eating there 4-5 times a week, and now I live next to Smoky's House, which I have been really enjoying! All of these joints get 5 stars, in my book. But to me, there will never, ever be a sauce that beats Porgy's. That's really what Porgy's is all about. It isn't really about the meat, or the bread, and there is no slaw. It is about the sauce. I think if you love bbq, you probably find that you fall into the \"sauce\" camp, or the \"meat\" camp. If you want the best meat in town, this is not going to be it. Ok? It is still very good and smoky, but not the best, and that's ok! Because everything at Porgy's has one simple purpose: to hold the sauce. You ALWAYS get extra sauce. Do not F-around on this. Forget the extra sauce, and it will be merely great...not amazing, as it is with mo' sauce. You ALWAYS get extra sauce, and you probably get extra fries or a slice of bread to...sigh...dip in the sauce.   The sauce itself is somewhat thin, very sweet, tangy, and a dark brown/maroon. I find it to be very different from any other sauce I have ever tasted. Personally, I always get the mild. This really is just another testament to the sauce's quality. I am a guy who really enjoys heat, but at Porgy's, I don't WANT heat, because I do not want anything to impair my ability to taste the delectable sauce. Am I obsessed with the sauce? Yes! Has my wife refused to go to Porgy's with me because she gets creeped out by how in the zone I am in regards to the sauce? Yes!  Now, I do know 2 people who just...don't like the sauce. It's just not their thing, and that is totally fine! (The Dude voice: \"That's...like...your opinion, man!\"). I get that. If you exclusively want a traditional bbq sauce, this not it.   Lastly, the price is amazing. I appreciate the other restaurants going with locally raised, organic stuff. Wonderful! Nice. But usually, I don't really want to spend $10 for a bbq sandwich meal. Porgy's is...what, $5 for a sandwich and fries? Just appreciate that fact, please.  So go there, buy a sandwich w/ fries and a shakeup, and never forget the extra sauce."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food, just dislike how dingy and old the place is. Wish they would put a little money into updating. Hate standing in line next to tables of people eating."}
{"text":"This place was a sunday regular for me when i was in school!  i always asked for the half chicken with extra spicy sauce (and all it really is, is that they toss a lot of cayenne pepper onto the chicken before they douse the meat with bbq sauce). for me, lil porgy's sauce was the best! a little sweet, tangy, spicy, and just the right thickness to the sauce where it coated the meat yet not cling on like a dip into ketchup.   its a tiny place but the service is quick enough that you can go as a group and have a feast for close to almost nothing.  have no shame in taking extra napkins to eat outside or ghetto munch in the parking lot! to those who are still in school, enjoy the cheap eat! and make them memories!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch.  I'm a BBQ fanatic. I try new BBQ whenever I visit different cities, as I travel a lot for work.   Not good BBQ. Meat was pretty dried out.  Brisket was not good.  Ribs were not good. Potato salad tasted like it was from the wal-mart deli.  The BBQ sauce was VERY strange. Some people might enjoy this place;  I did not. BBQ enthusiasts stay away.  I gave it 2 stars because the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"I was never a huge fan of bbq but I would have to say this place of all places is the one that somewhat converted me. Succulent ribs slathered in a finger licking sauce that contains a perfect ratio of tart to spice, enough to start a runny nose and break a sweat. The fries are damn good too, esp. if you let them marinate in that sauce. If they had this place in Chicago, all the current existing rib shacks would probably go out of business and shut down.... well, all except Smoke Daddy's. An extra star bc they had a fruit stand in front that had these gigantic mother plums which were sooo sweeeet, you know, as in taste palate sweet. Heck, what more of a perfect way to balance my pork rib meal with a side of fresh country grown fruit.  I couldn't get over how good they were or the bright majestic magenta pulp; I ate about 4 that day. Those nasty-sour/bland, wax-coated-discolored mini-wanna-be plums from the city cannot step to these plums."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town, without question. Extremely fast and efficient service, cheap and in a convenient location for students, nearby residents, and employees on work-breaks. There was a controversy awhile back regarding their cleanliness, but it is a noticeably clean restaurant and I have never personally noticed anything gross or vile."}
{"text":"Restaurant review: Cheap tasty BBQ fresh from the smoker. I was excited about visiting this location because I drive by here everyday and I can smell the the restaurant smoking the pork everyday. The restaurant has very good prices for BBQ food with daily specials as well. They take your order you get your food when they call your number. One downside is that they charge you ten cents for a coupon of water. Who charges for water? We ordred the pulled pork sandwich which came with fries. The pulled pork was above average size. The BBQ sauce was a bit on the watery side which detracted from the experience. Fries were average, I would say the fries at Five Guys is better. Overall cheap, inexpensive, but not spectacular. My quest for BBQ continues in Champaign.  Pro: inexpensive, daily specials, fresh smoked BBQ  Cons: watery BBQ sauce, only mild and spicy choice  Hidden gem: Daily specials (most up to date price Aug 2014) Sunday 1/2 chicken 5.10 Monday Small rib tips 5.39 Tuesday 1/3 pork ribs 5.49 or chicken sandwich 4.85 Wednesday beef sandwich 4.85 Thursday pork sandwich 4.85 Friday 1/2 slab beef ribs 7.10 Saturrdayy 1/2 slab pork ribs 7.49"}
{"text":"I liked it a LOT!!    Had the half chicken.  All meals come with steak fries, which were delicious!  Food came fast.  Service was outstanding.  Prices were reasonable.  They seem popular.  I would definitely come again.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Overall good. And the Sunday special for half chicken is a good price.. But chicken could use a little more seasoning I think. Would prefer a crispier steak fry but they usually end up soggy at the bottom of the tray. I usually get a craving once a month tho for porgys.  Not sure how some say this is great BBQ, I always feel like the flavor is lacking overall.. but it's still good occasionally."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to Memphis from Chicago. We thought it would be fun to try and it smelled good. Everything after that was disappointing. I got the brisket sandwich which was dry, cut up very small, and drenched in a glorified ketchup. My wife got the pork which was \"the most popular\" according to the guy at the register. It also was chopped finely and very dry. Fries came complimentary which isn't saying much because you get about 5 or 6. If I had to do it again I would move on and eat barbecue anywhere else."}
