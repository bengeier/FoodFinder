{"text":"My friend and I decided to visit Pa'La for lunch.  I arrived before she had and met the owner who gave me water as well as olives & almonds until she arrived.  
We decided to share a shrimp bowl and the fat bread.  Everything was delicious and fresh.  I'm glad this is our area and I look forward to future meals!"}
{"text":"Checked out this new place for lunch today. Charming setting, helpful service, fresh delicious unique food. I can't wait to return so that I can try more of their interesting creations. And hoping they might open for dinners soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  We had the anchovies tapas - anchovies in vinegar.  If you like mackerel sushi you would love this dish.  We also had the mussels & hake in a tomato based broth.  Fantastic.  The broth was rich and complex.  Saving the best for last - the Navarro bowl.  This is one of the best dishes I've ever had.  A mix of grains, beans, vegetables, dressing, spices, and diver scallops.  An incredible mix of favors and textures.

The ambiance is casual/classy.  It's counter service, but the chef comes to your table and can answer whatever questions you have.  The bowls and flatware are all made from a balsa like wood that is compostable and was fun to eat with.   They also have a nice patio for outdoor dining.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Since others have already described the Ramon Navarro ( a Peruvian surfer) Bowl perfectly, the only thing I might add is that is was THE culinary highlight of my first visit to Phoenix. ( the small plates were all excellent too) If this restaurant was here in the SF Bay area, the line to get in would be out of the door and around the building. Chef and surfer himself, Claudio has created a fantastic food experience... Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a lovely evening on the Pa'La patio. The patio is quaint and unassuming, perfect for a night with friends, family, or SO. We devoured everything from the fresh mozzarella to the anchovies to the Navarro bowl with shrimp. This place is definitely worth a visit. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Cute, family-owned establishment. Seems to have some room for improvement. Ambiance is great outside, with a beautiful patio and fires. Inside is a bit cold and brightly lit, crowded with not a lot of privacy between tables. We noticed people had brought their own wine bottles but that wasn't posted anywhere as something you could do. Paper plates and bowls seemed a bit cheap, considering the price of the food, made it feel like more of a fast-food place that's good for weekday lunch. Grouper and shrimp entrees were delicious, but simple and small, considering price. Mixed grains side was really tasty though."}
{"text":"What a great place! It has a real European feel. The menu is constantly changing so they don't have anything printed it's all written on the chalkboard behind the counter. Closes early at 3 PM. It's a little hard to know what to get him in a little hard to understand the waiter."}
{"text":"A hidden gem that really surprised me. The menu is small, but the dishes are really unique and constantly changing. The food had a high end presentation and taste, but at a very reasonable price, served in a casual atmosphere. I had a steak pita, but to just call it a steak pita over-simplifies it. This place turned the pita into a gourmet item. Great food!"}
{"text":"Adorable! Charming! The best bread ever. The cutest chefs. Local beers and AZ wines. The mozzarella for two was amazing. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Lovely, had a great lunch with a friend. Split a grain and seared tuna bowl and fresh mozzarella with fresh baked pizza dough as the bread to eat it with. Simple tapas. Food is clean, simple, and very very good. They had local high quality wines and beer on the menus as well. Staff is so nice, food came out very fast. Finished lunch with complementary amazing espresso. Lovely outdoor space, quiet despite being on 24th st. Would highly recommend, will bring my husband back as a surprise as it reminds me of tapas bars in Spain. I look forward to trying their other dishes."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a unique menu. Food was super healthy, just enough food and incredible tasting food! Highly recommend especially if you like to be a little adventurous."}
{"text":"This place is terrific! Such fresh and healthy ingredients and the owner and all staff are so friendly! We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am in love! This might be my new absolute favorite!!! First, the place is adorable and the patio is so charming. I am huge on service and although you order at the board, it is not \"a joint.\" There is true care and detail at every turn. The chef/owner and his staff were incredibly welcoming and kind. They actually cared and it showed. 

It's a simple, well-considered menu that reflects the attention the chef gives to putting our excellent fresh food. 

The quality of the food...every single bite...was amazing. We had A LOT of food because we just couldn't decide! It all sounded so good. We had marinated olives and almonds, mussels brodetto, and an Italian mozzarella salad (the cheese and olive oil were dreamy). Thank heavens for the perfect bread...chewy, crusty, charcoal bubbles from the fire...thank you!!! For entrees we had the shrimp and tuna on a farro and white bean salad respectively. The wood fired aspect of the seafood brought all the smoky goodness you crave. The unexpected star of the entree was the farro salad. Just perfect pairing with the seafood. Delicious! The mussels brodetto had great deep flavors with the right heat and the freshest mussels...highly recommended. 

A nice touch is that everything is served on compostable dishware...down to the flatware! Which would be my one and only \"complaint.\" I'd love to see the flatware have a smoother mouth feel. But who cares...food is so good and the responsible aspect of not filling landfills is worth the trade off. Thank you Pa'La for this choice. 

We also had a great bottle of rose for $20. It was a well-priced add to our meal. Again, such good wine selections, we struggled to choose. Seriously this chef has an amazing palate! 

I cannot wait to come back! If you're looking for a food experience that rivals anything in the valley...just go already!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Claudio Urciuoli for a number of years now and he never fails to surprise and delight. Pa'La is no exception. The burrata was incredibly fresh and creamy and the bread was delightfully smokey. The Navarro bowl consisted of a unique blend of grains, vegetables, and flavorful crunchy bits. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pa'la is a converted house with a very interesting menu. My husband and I stopped in for lunch and were given a warm greeting by a staff member. The menu is small and changes daily, we were given a detailed explanation of each dish and also recommendations on how much to order. We decided on the manchego and salami tapas, ceviche and the Roman Navarro grain bowl with albacore tuna. The manchego was rich in flavor and the salami was high quality. The ceviche had a lot of dynamic textures, the fish was fresh and I really liked the crunch of the corn nuts and flavor of the peppers. The grain bowl was awesome, healthy yet delicious and the tuna was perfectly cooked and a great cut of fish. I've been following their social media and they've recently announced that they will be open for dinner which is awesome! I cant wait to return and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Fabulous food, outstanding dining experience. Our group of 6 decided to not pick our dishes and just go with whatever they decided to feed us and were we in for a treat! The menu changes daily so looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Such a nice find in an unexpected location!  I met a friend here for lunch last month to celebrate the holidays.  We both enjoyed the highly recommended and delicious Italian lemon sparkling drink.  We shared the burrata with tomatoes and pita and I enjoyed the 5 grains bowl with rock shrimp for my entree - so tasty and flavorful!  Definitely a nice, healthy option to add to the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Good food, but I do not agree with the reviewers who said the prices are reasonable here. Not at all. I went with a colleague from work, enjoyed the food, but left hungry and with a bill of $30 for lunch (for two). That would be OK if you were getting a full meal, but we only had a shared appetizer and a little bowl of olives, and two glasses of water. It's a nice clean place, obviously put together with love by the chef, and the menu is very unique. So it's kind of an experience. But being that when you go out to eat a quick lunch from an office you can't be spending $15 each or more daily, we'll stop here only on occasion where special events are taking place. Drop the price 20%, or fill me up a bit better, and I'd be back three times a week."}
{"text":"Pa'la is a very small very casual restaurant with a patio. This isn't an average restaurant. The food served is of the highest quality. The House Made Bread and Seafood offered is Wood Fired. (at the time of this review Dec.2017) The menu offered is ever changing and very limited. On the day of my visit a few tapas appetizers were offered, One open faced Tuscan Style Sandwich, 2 Seafood Grain Bowls and Farro Cookies. That's was it. At Pa'la you order at the counter and sit in the very small but modern dining room or the slightly bigger comfortable Patio. All our food was served on Paper ware and our silverware was plastic.

We started with a Tapas and tried the Artichokes in extra virgin olive oil ($5.00) I have to be honest an admit the portion was far smaller than I thought it would be. We received a quarter of a very small artichoke in great quality olive oil and it was sprinkled with some sort of fruity pepper. It was a nicely marinated Artichoke. 

We shared the Ramon Navarro Bowl (5 grains and vegetables topped with fish Bowl). I picked the Hand Harpooned Swordfish. The Grains were served like a salad (not warm). All the grains were nicely prepared and were studded with vegetables and seeds. The Swordfish was a good size portion and was flaky and mild. It was lightly seasoned and had a mild wood oven taste. Everything in the bowl was mild and very natural tasting. The bowl was suppose to be made with a Wu Wan Wo Soy Sauce. It's not a deal breaker or anything (the bowl was still GOOD) but neither of us tasted anything that resembles soy sauce in this dish. If the sauce was used it was used very sparingly. (I looked up this special soy sauce and read that it goes for $40.00 for a small bottle....that might be why it was used so sparingly)

My husband mostly ate the Schiacciata (opened faced wood oven whole grain bread sandwich). The sandwich contained greens, very good quality Rosemary Ham, Manchego Cheese and Unusual Peppers. The sandwich was very good and made on very flavorful bread.

Lastly we tried the Farro Cookies. I thought of them like Italian Thumbprint Cookies. The Cookie was sort of like a more flavorful shortbread and topped with very natural tasting bitter Grapefruit Jam. Really Different.

Very Natural Tasting Food of the highest quality. 

The man working the counter was very helpful and friendly.

At this time Pa'la is difficult to find because the sign isn't up yet. Look for the small white building next to the green building."}
{"text":"No longer BYOB.  License now obtained and they have lots of very reasonably-priced wine options (bottles in the $20 range).  Not really a fan of the disposable bamboo bowls, plates, and utensils - especially for soup  - but you can't complain too much given the food quality for the prices charged.

The overall theme is quality, healthy ingredients (fresh seafood, olive oils, vinegars) simply prepared and presented.  Their wood burning oven cranks out delicious bread.  The menu is basically a virtual mini-trip to a Spanish or Italian coastal town.

We ordered olives/almonds ($4), boquerones ($7), a bowl of mussels with bits of sliced sausage ($13), and shared a main-course mixed grain bowl topped with skate wing ($16).  All were hits, though the mussels (light, clean, and plump = excellent!) portion seemed a bit light.  

Most of the seating is outdoors and I suggest time your visit to avoid the summer sun/heat - or come right at opening and snag one of the few shady tables inside.  If you arrive too early - you can wait it out at the brewery literally just a couple of doors up...

A good place to graze and sip.  Rinse.  Repeat."}
{"text":"Happy experience. I am giving this restaurant a 4 star rating instead of a 3 because of how friendly the staff was and how awesome the space. The menu changes daily so they run out of things that you might be interested in. As we sat there for an hour they ran out of 4 of the 8 things. We got the flat bread, the bowl, a meat kabab tapa, mussels tapa, the cookie (bite sized) and some bottled water. The one that stood out the most was the bowl. We added scallops. My husband even liked it and it had a ton of things in it he normally wouldn't eat (like beans). I think he was attracted to the vinegary sauce it had on it. Our friend that met us is foreign and all she really wanted a chicken or beef dish which they had neither of. Mainly fish (which she doesn't like). Love the space! We will probably give it another go."}
{"text":"This place does tapas so well and the head chef takes serious care of the customers. They explain everything dish with such gusto that you will be drooling before you order.

They still have a long way to go as far as getting a liquor license and a better flow but it's already top notch"}
{"text":"Is there a Phoenix culinary equivalent to knighthood that we can bestow upon Claudio Urciuoli?  His contributions to our meals over the years have really elevated our palates.

Pa'la is, perhaps, his most simple and singular offering yet.  Their menu is minimalist but they are able to coax the absolute most out of the freshest ingredients.  A highlight are the Navarro bowls.  (I'm interested in learning about whatever backstory exists between the dish and surfer)  There's no point in wasting your time or your finest yoga pants at a place like Flower Child when you can get a superior offering here at roughly the same price."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Ramon Navarro Bowl with Halibut. It was outstanding! The seasonings were perfect!The scallop ceviche tapa was also phenomenal! Can't wait to go again. They open for dinner too next Thursday!"}
{"text":"Pa'La is a truly spectacular restaurant. The quality of the ingredients is unmatched and the unique ways that Claudio puts things together unparalleled in Phoenix. I love the ambiance and environment in the restaurant too- the smell of the wood burning fires, great music and beautiful patio are just a lovely place to enjoy a fabulous meal. If you are looking for a gourmet meal in a warm, unpretentious atmosphere, there is nowhere better. Can't wait to come back very soon!"}
{"text":"24th Street keeps getting better. Chef Claudio has brought a much needed healthy lunch (and now dinner) option to the neighborhood! Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Great new addition to central Phoenix.  Service and food are top notch.  Brings a new perspective to the growing culinary scene.  Definitely a staple and a place everyone should check out."}
{"text":"Met a gal pal here for lunch.   She and I both thought the menu and concept looked good. 

There is a small seating area inside as well as tables and chairs for outdoor dining.  We perused the menu on the board.   There were two ladies sitting next to us.   We asked what they were having and asked if it was good.   They agreed they liked what they had; therefore, we had the same thing!

I decided on the whole grain pita, and my friend had the five-grain salad.  While we waiting for our lunch to be made, we were given green olives and cashews.   Yumm!   Especially on the cashews.

We tried each other's food.   I liked hers and she liked mine.   I must admit, I did like her salad more than mine.   Next time. ...

I liked the salad dressing on my accompanying greens, which was a tiny bit on the \"hot\" and spicy side.   It was perfect.  

I liked the mix of the items in her salad, which included different grains as well as beans.   She opted for the non-meat version.

I like the fact the owner, Claudio, uses the \"green\" method with his plates, cups, silverware.   No straws.   The \"silverware\" is made from sugarcane at lunch and bamboo at dinner.   I asked Claudio where I could get those items.   He gets it from a distributor, 500 each.   Uhhhh.   Guess I'm not getting those.   Maybe I'll check at Smart and Final. ...

I will definitely return, especially to get the Navarro salad that my friend got."}
{"text":"We enjoyed sitting on the deck under the stars and the string lights. Healthy, fresh food with a Mediterranean twist. The chef/owner came over to say hi and was happy to make suggestions. Groovy central Phoenix foodies will appreciate this new dining spot."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal! We will definitely be back and soon. The menu changes daily based on what the chef can get from the local farmer's markets and you can taste the difference. Everything we had was amazing and you get to bring your own wine and beer. What's not to love!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place could be great (with just a few tweaks). The menu is a little 'confusing'. The person behind the counter did his best to explain the different items. While I appreciated the effort it only left us more confused. After we ordered we weren't 100% sure what we were even getting, short of the tapas, they are pretty straight forward. But we were delighted in the end result (the food was fabulous!). We had the flatbread thingy and the grain bowl thingy. Both amazing. The Avocado toast tapa was AWESOME. One additional note. They said you can get your own booze and drink it there (since they did not have license yet). BUT (and it's a big one), they charged us an almost 10 dollar uncork fee (you walk down two doors, get your wine, bring it back, and they charge you 10 bucks to open it, mandatory fee). YUCK, I really hate that. Left a bad taste in my mouth (I have been to other BYOB places and NEVER heard this terrible policy). Stop that or get your license."}
{"text":"This is a place you must check out. They use all organic foods from select farmers practicing responsible agriculture. They compost everything, and recycle everything else. The chef was telling me their waste is non-existent, when I asked about their awesome sustainable wood sporks. Yeah, that's right. Freggin sporks! I knew I was going to have a phenomenal meal when I saw them. 

It's a wood fired and forged steel grill setup, but it's much more than your average pop-up wood fired gourmet pizza spot. Their dishes are driven by cultures of the Mediterranean and South America. The menu changes very frequently, so chances are next time you're there, it will be an entirely new experience than the last. 

It's a small, quaint little spot that deserves a gander. You won't be diappointed. 

Pro tip: if you ask about the origin of the food you're eating, you will learn it all. They are not shy about telling you where it comes from, how it was produced and prepared."}
{"text":"Now housed in newly renovated bungalo with indoor and outdoor seating and lots of character, Chef Claudio is back and Pa'La will not disappoint... you can tell he put his heart and soul into the project and continues to do so with his locally sourced menu that changes daily.

On a recent Thursday date night, my husband and I popped in and ordered a variety of tapas and plates to share.  We sat at the community table and ended up making a new friend (hello Tony if you happen to read this).  We enjoyed not only the food but the casual, warm atmosphere and conversation with both Chef Claudio and Jason Dickmeyer, who are both super knowledgeable on the menu, local farming, food scene in the valley, and so much more.

Standout dishes from the evening were the parmesan and mozzarella + speck tapas, the Navarro bowl topped with fresh grilled grouper, ceviche, anchovies, and of course, their schiacciata (aka Italian flatbread that made in house without white flour).  All delicious!  We brought our own bottle of wine -- until they get their own liquor license, it's a small $10 corking fee.

Note: everything is served on recyclable paper / plastic, but the Pa'La family is committed to caring for the environment and working with local recycling companies.  The oils, vinegars, produce, grains and seafood you find on the menu is all sourced from organic farmers and artisans practicing responsible agriculture and production.  

I look forward to many return visits to Pa'La, and hopefully ordering from the catering menu they offer as well."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't left a review on Pa'La! Wow Pa'La was amazing! I ordered a steak pita and it was so tasty and inexpensive. I could not believe the quality for the price. I recommend coming for an early dinner because they have limited quantity. We I arrived around 7 they were already out of a burrata appetizer dish that sounded amazing! I ordered the marinated olives instead! Pa'La is set up as fast casual service style. You order at the counter and then they bring out your order. We ate outside on patio, which is super cute and trendy! Pa'La is the perfect place to have a high quality, flavorful meal at really affordable price."}
{"text":"Claudio is a genius. Who would think that a chef with his talent could also have such an eye for design. As we ate our appetizer (tapas to him) of buffalo mozzarella on arugula and tomatoes, I noticed how well done the interior was. It's the old Simply Bread shop on 24th st and it looks great. Clean lines, clear view to the wood fired oven. Wines were very reasonable ($20/bottle) food was exceptional and the atmosphere will bring you back. Go there.You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Thursday.  Pa'La has a Southern Italy vibe, think sun dappled olive and lemon tree groves, with a SoCal twist.  We tried some of the tapas: mozzarella bufala salad, with very fresh arugula and nice, ripe cherry tomatoes; a salumi plate; and olives and almonds.  We shared a Ramon Navarro bowl, which has just the right amount of soft, chewy grains and nuts, with a decent price of halibut on top.  So don't be intimidated by the menu, the opener will gladly explain it for you.  Now go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in Phoenix, in my opinion. The quality of ingredients is rarely seen in Phoenix and you can immediately taste this quality in the food. I had a seemingly simple Polenta that came expertly seared with a small green salad grown in their back yard. Sweet, creamy, crunchy, savory all at once. Incredible. I then moved to a simple lentil soup with homemade croutons and finished with a splash of the best olive oil you can find. Rich yet light with incredible depth. I could go on but you should just go try it for yourself."}
{"text":"This is the kinda thing we need more of in Phoenix. The food is good, the experience even better. Only been once, so I can't comment on everything. You can sense they're interested in craft, not just selling you something. I will be returning often."}
{"text":"When I see Claudio Urciuoli name pop up, aside from Noble Eatery, I'm always reminded of his brief attachment to Chris Bianco's Italian Restaurant, which was sort of a prototype of what eventually became Tratto. 

I've been hearing about Pa'La for awhile now, but was reluctant to try them due to my lack of interest in eating fish. Thankfully, there are happy alternatives available for those of us who aren't really into seafood. 

Pa'La operates out of a little converted-house with a setup that's charming, small, and a bit congested on nights when it becomes crowded. 

Dominic Armato recently reviewed Pa'La, selling it as a place where you can eat cheaply. The cheapness might be true if you order a small lunch and a water, but if you're shooting for a full multi-course dinner, your bill will be comparable to most mid-level places in Phoenix. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course. Dinner hours are only available on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. 

It's a tricky menu, because what's available one day might not be available the next. And worse, something that might have been showcased for lunch, might not be available two hours later for dinner as I quickly learned. 

Complimentary olives and delicious almonds are a nice touch, but not when they're serving them to practically every table except yours. I guess you can awkwardly request them if they forget?

There are a few standouts to note. Both their burrata and mozzarella di bufala are some of the best you can find in the city. Additionally, the Ramon Navarro bowl, named after the Chilean surfer, combines a multitude of different ingredients that all work incredibly well together. Although the preparation of this seems to vary a bit, as we both enjoyed it better the first time than we did the second.

Their sandwiches (or single sandwich) is also very good and right up there with some of the best I've found at Pane Bianco. Although don't expect a lot of variation or anymore than one single option.

Overall, Pa'La is a cool little place that serves food that some would say has absolutely no business being served on paper plates. But in the end, I think it works just fine for what they're trying to accomplish.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Such a delicious, healthy and colorful blend of food.  So glad I saw this on Yelp as I began my drive back across town.  Totally worth stopping.  This restaurant has the charm of a well loved neighborhood home with those huge Sunflowers along the road.  And the grape vines along the West wall will certainly add to the character.  The steps up and the entrance gives it the feel that you've come to someone's home for a visit.  Warm and welcoming.
Inside it's simple, but behind the counter is where it gets interesting.  Not only a woodfired oven but a wood burning grill.  I was pleasantly surprised by what appears simplistic but know it really is much more complicated when it comes to cooking.  Not everyone can successfully create a meal over a fire that has to be watched and maintained to regulate the temp.
I don't often have a chance to come across town for a meal but this place will be one I hit when I do."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!!  Open just a month but sure to be a hit everywhere they open. It has the freshest ingredients and a menu that changes daily depending on what is available. All organic. Local sourcing. Wood fired grill. Fresh lemonade."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet-you are missing some of the best food in town. Simple, straight forward top quality ingredients, reliably sourced- it doesn't get any better than this.
It's counter service but you won't feel neglected - Chef Claudio 
(formerly of Noble Bread) is passionate about food and it shows in every detail of Pa'La. 
The newly renovated 1920s bungalow feels just right for this casual, homey restaurant.  It's a perfect neighborhood destination for Arcadia, Coronado, central Phoenix folk."}
{"text":"We heard some great chatter about Pa'La so off we went, two sea food lovers trying to get a taste of the ocean in the desert. The space is pretty cool except for hard benches and chairs (bad back). We got the lo-down of the menu from the chef and ordered rick shrimp and blue fish that came on there signature grain bowls. I loved the grains! Husband who normally opts for very rich sauces etc. really enjoyed this blend as well. The one con that marked off a star was the long wait for our food. Cooked to order is the best way to experience any cuisine but it just seemed to take extra long, worth the wait if you hadn't skipped two meals already! We will definitely be back to try some more delish seafood!"}
{"text":"Chic flavorful healthy..... my kinda place! Everything was outstanding!  Love , Love the vibe!"}
{"text":"Very interesting place. The menu is limited and apparently changes daily (so it's not listed online). I'm vegetarian and didn't think they had any options for me. However, the guy was very friendly and suggested the bowl and to leave out the seafood. Surprisingly he gave me the food for a discounted price. I honestly had no idea what I was ordering. The bowl was awesome. The grains and veggies were cold which I wasn't expecting. I don't usually like cold food like this, but it was awesome. Great flavors and seemed like it was also healthy. My husband got some steak pita thing and he was very impressed. This place is s hidden gem."}
{"text":"One of the best chefs in the valley working with only the best ingredients.  Go here ASAP."}
{"text":"Great new find. 24th st palm lane at this point byob open thursday to Saturday after 530. Echo friendly food resourced fresh everyday.  A hidden jem....tapas style.  Totally recommend."}
{"text":"Chef Claudio is back.  This time he has gutted an old white house on 24th Street and converted it into a casual dining treat for lunch or dinner.  Pa'la ingredients are shopped fresh on a daily basis.  If ingredients are not fresh or at their peak goodness, then they don't make it on the menu for the day.  You can expect an always revolving menu.

I came in to enjoy lunch.  Claudio started me off with a dish of picholine olives and spicy marcona almonds.  Next out came the burratina and olive oil served with wedges of fresh fire-roasted bread.  I was curious about the special Izzio rye bread which Claudio toasted in the wood oven and then topped with avocado mixed with tasty oil and herbs.  Finally came my lunch.  I probably could have stopped right there, but the presentation of the spicy copa and mozzarella topped with greens and cuerno de toro peppers, served open-face on wood-fired flatbread was too much for my taste buds to resist.  I thought I might save some for later, but then looked down on my plate and everything was gone.

You can dine indoors or enjoy a beautiful day on the new wood deck patio.  Either way, you are sure to enjoy something very good, very different and made with only the best ingredients.

Lunch at Pa'La will typically run you anywhere between $11 and $20 depending on how much you splurge on the available choices."}
{"text":"Chef Claudio is the bees knees !! We had the best time sharing a bottle of delicious (and so affordable!) wine on his cozy patio. We started w an unbelievable ricotta spread on fresh warm pita and finished w a delicious espresso and faro biscotti. Get in here you guys !!"}
{"text":"So we actually just ordered 1 of everything on the menu, and licked every plate clean. Such clean and fresh flavors. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Shared the buffalo mozzarella, arugula and tomatoes with bread to start- absolutely delicious and so fresh. Had the Navarro Bowl with shrimp and my husband got his with swordfish. They were amazing! The Navarro bowls themselves are absolutely delicious and our seafood was cooked perfectly. The ambiance is great too- nothing has been overlooked here. Very high quality and partners with lots of local food purveyors. 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous space and just awesome food, highly recommend. Be sure to check out Wren House next door if you're into beer."}
{"text":"The cuisine is mind blowing what can I say you just have to try it, have an open mind and a love of great eats."}
{"text":"A Mediterranean restaurant with a wood-fired menu!  Arrived at 11:30 for a business lunch and the music was so loud inside we reluctantly chose to eat out on their patio in the sun (a few weeks back it was a chilly day!) so we could talk shop. I had the octopus salad and my client ordered the burrata salad.  Both arrived with flatbread which was unseasoned and flat to taste, yet if dipping or using as a sandwich, the dough/texture was good.  My salad was delicious and octopus was properly cooked.  Burrata needed salt & pepper - as typical for my palette.  Three stars for a few reasons: 1) This is a super-casual place (paper plates/plastic utensils) and a nice patio lunch spot, especially when the weather is nice. Not conducive for an evening meal unless going for takeout.  2) Price was spendy for a lunch - especially if you order an appetizer and beverages.  3) Have I mentioned the music inside was too loud for conversation?"}
{"text":"The food is healthy and clean tasting that it triggers your taste bud. I had the tasting menu, so I got to try a little of everything. It was delish! The complimentary almonds and olives they give was slightly spicy but delicious. Their food are full of flavors. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Oh my heavens! I can't believe Phoenix has this culinary treasure! What a great restaurant find. Having lived in Europe for 5 years, I crave meals cooked in a wood fired oven, not to mention the breads as well. Pa'La is the real deal! I love, Love, Love it. Will be back often, with friends. Can't wait do try ALL of their creations."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about Pa'La. As my wife says, it feels like you are transported outside of Arizona. The restaurant has so much charm, inside a beautifully renovated old house. The quality of ingredients is amazing and the composition of dishes phenomenal. It always helps us slow down and truly savor the food. We love that the menu is constantly changing based on what Chef Claudio finds to be the best ingredients of the day. We also love the casual feel and value, enabling us to visit more than those pricier, more special occasion type restaurants. The staff are also ridiculously nice and go beyond to explain and educate the kids (and us) on the ingredients and dishes. We look forward to returning again and again!"}
{"text":"Let's get the obvious out of the way. This is not a typical restaurant. There isn't much to say in the way of service, you order at the counter, and plates, cups, and utensils are all biodegradable. If you want a typical Phoenix processed meal, and valet parking, go some place else. 

Now, let's talk about the food, because it is amazing. 
Here's what we ate:
Olives and Marcona almonds - beautiful natural flavors, spicy seasoning. 
Mussels and beans - sweet plump mussels cooked in a tomato and fennel broth with beans and fresh cooked bread in the wood fired oven. 
Anchovies with potato salad- bright, brilliant flavors.

Ramon Navarro bowl with shrimp - perhaps one of the best dishes I've had in Phoenix. Grains, vegetables, and 3 succulent shrimp. 

Everything was perfectly seasoned, packed with flavor, and well prepared. 

All this in a beautiful setting. It will become  a dining destination.  

My only complaint would be there is no one front of house to prepare you for what your experience will be- how to order, why everything is biodegradable, why only a wood fired oven, etc. please start trying to sell yourself. 

I'll be back. Oh yes, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I hesitate to write about how great this is because I'd rather keep this neighborhood gem to myself. The food is fantastic and changes daily based on what is fresh. We had a fresh burrata salad that was just magnificent - a baseball sized ball of fresh cheese with a perfectly dressed bed on arugula and tomatoes. We also shared a bowl with superb fish (Hake) on a bed of wonderfully prepared toasted grains.  They have a selection of very reasonably priced wines - we had a spanish red blend that was nice. This is quite informal dining in a restored bungalow with indoor and patio dining. You place your order at the counter and they bring the food out to your table. The dinnerware is all compostable - starch based utensils and paper bowls, but it doesn't detract from the fantastic food."}
{"text":"Outside looks like a converted home and unassuming. Look fast or you might pass it by. Insidr is simple with concrete floor and simple decor. The menu is written on a chalkboard and changes daily. Today, I tried the skate (sting ray) navarro bowl and my partner tried the shrimp. For $16 each bowl we got some complimentary olives and pecan snack.  The skate amd shrimp were cooked well amd the bowl was delicious, however $16 for 3 shrimp in a grain bowl definitely seemed high. It was good, but not worth $16. That's why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the octopus & greens salad, which blew me away. Although I have come to expect octopus to be tough and chewy, I wanted to try it here anyway. This octopus was both crispy and tender and completely delicious! It was served with a complimentary mix of dressed greens and flat bread, all house made. So good! We also had a mussels & cannelloni bean soup, and an olive & almond tapas and were not disappointed on any count. The staff was exceptionally helpful and explained the whole menu and various ingredient choices to us.  It's in a great location with plenty of parking in back.  We will definitely be back and I highly recommend you give it a visit if you, like me, crave some highly satisfying diversity in your diet."}
{"text":"Eight Thumbs Up!  Why eight?  Because that was THE BEST octopus I've ever had. I'm a military type, so I've had some amazing opportunities to eat seafood in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Thailand... sorry, too braggadocios, but seriously I feel like I have a pretty good history with my polyarmed aquatic friend and I'm every bit as surprised as you to be in the position of saying the best octopus in the world is being served in land-locked Phoenix Arizona. 

By the way, the mussels soup and olive & almond tapas were amazing as well.  I am so glad I ate here, and you will be, too!"}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy and filling. I loved that all their utinsils/cups/plates are compostable. Even the straws. Thank you! Nice outside seating. Order at the counter and the staff will deliver the food to you. Can't wait to return on my next business trip!"}
