{"text":"The first time I went to Flemmings was a few months ago in Glendale. We went with some friends for 5 6 before 7. My wife and I thought I was pretty good. We had bought some gift cards at Costco and got some more gift cards as a gift and had intended to visit the Flemmings in chandler My wife snd I went here this week to celebrate our 3 year anniversary.  The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because of the atmosphere.  It was very loud. So loud the waiter had to talk even louder and I could still barely hear him. 2 things I noticed that caused this situation was 1 the music in the restaurant was loud and more pop style (It could have been any style of music) and 2 the seating.  Not that full of a night but everyone was seated close together and that makes it so everyone had to talk louder.  Our waiter was just fine and the food was really good. Still though for the price of it I don't want to feel like I'm at a normal family restaurant where I expect it to be loud. My wife and I decided that we would do the specials before dinner time but not eat dinner here again"}
{"text":"Excellent food, top-notch service, exorbitantly priced.  Not for budget minded diners..."}
{"text":"Had the NY  strip, green beans, Mac & cheese and key lime pie. Out of a group of four that shared the same side dishes, I ended up getting food poisoning! Three days later and I'm still feeling the effects and lost six pounds too! I will not be going back... Diner beware!"}
{"text":"Sunday night prime rib special is amazing!  Comes with salad, side dish, and dessert!  This prime rib was the best I think I have had!  Usually when you order it rare to mid rare it can be a little tough or chewy, but this prime rib melted in my mouth!  There were four of us, we all ordered the same special with different sides so we all could share...highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Steak and lobster...what could be better?  The food is always consistent, the service is attentive and thorough. Clearly ranking among the best if not THE best steakhouse in the Chandler area.  The happy hour bar area is nice as an alternative and they have the full menu available as well.  Used to come here as a special occasion place but it has now established itself in my general rotation of high quality nights on the town."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for our anniversary.  We had the peppercorn steak, Flemings Potatoes, and a salad.  The food was good but not great. I think we could have split the steak and potatoes and ordered our own salad. We also had two beers and one drink. I ordered a cheesecake to go and they forgot the sauce that went with the cheesecake.  Our bill came to $133.00. Now I'm not sure what part of that experience was worth what we paid. There wasn't anything about the food or the experience that was that spectacular."}
{"text":"Amazing food, customer service and atmosphere.  We eat here at least twice a month with zero disappointment.  Today was outstanding. The perfect dining experience. Ill have to blame that on Brittany.  She was attentive, on point and spectacular at customer service and the cooked had her back by cooking us perfect burgers. She suggested the perfect drink and treated us as if we were her friends and she was our hostess.  And if course i had the best company in the house. Thanks Flemings for having us tonight. Doesn't matter if we are dressed up or dressed down we always get the great service"}
{"text":"This was the second time I've been to Fleming's. Both times have been very enjoyable. This time, a friend told me about a bar special called 5 for 6 'til 7. It is five menu items (mixed drinks, wine, appetisers, etc. for $6 until 7 P.M.). You can still order off the menu, but the specials are only available in the bar, and tables are available in the bar area. Everything we ordered was excellent. I had the steak sandwich (another bar special), which was terrific. If you are a wine drinker, don't go to Fleming's if you are thirsty. The amount of wine they serve (a friend ordered a glass of Merlot) for $6 is ridiculous. They bring a huge glass for the wine, and a little carafe of wine, barely enough to wet the inside of the glass. Stick with the mixed drinks or beer. For you beer drinkers, beer is only available in bottles. No beer on tap, which is a shame for a restaurant of this caliber. Hopefully, when the economy improves, Fleming's will continue with some kind of specials, like the 5 for 6 'til 7."}
{"text":"Our group of six ate there on a Friday night.  We had steak, fish, scallops and many sides and salads.  We all agreed we were completely disappointed with the food.  Our bill was around 450 (we didn't have any alcoholic beverages) and we could have gotten better meals for less than half the price.  Service was decent.  Save your money."}
{"text":"Consistently good and constantly packed chain. As usual a little noisy but nice atmosphere if you like a higher energy feel. Had the clam chowder at 13.95 a bowl with a ton of the bread, which is served with 2 great flavored butters (cheesy). Chowder was was very good, not overly rich with cream like some places. Had the 12 oz filet medium rare with the fleming potatoes (yum!), Brussel sprouts, and some shoestring potatoes (very crispy).Everything was great, with the steak done perfectly.Of course at these prices you should expect that. I have had the chocolate lava dessert before, but this time shared the carrot cake for dessert, both are excellent. Another nice prime steak dining experience."}
{"text":"This is just about as good as it gets!  When we went for dinner at about five o'clock, the place was nearly empty, so we did not incur the dreaded wait.  After being seated, our waiter politely introduced himself and asked for our beverage orders.  Our beverages were out in under two minutes and the waiter was more than willing to offer helpful recommendations about what was best on the menu.  I decided to go with the New York Strip cooked medium rare with garlic mashed potatoes and a Caesar salad.  The steak was impeccable, with every bite melting in my mouth.  The Caesar salad was about as good as a Caesar gets, and the garlic mashed potatoes were exploding with flavor.  For dessert, I decided upon the lava cake, which I did not share.  The lava cake was so amazing that I felt compelled to share information regarding its goodness with everyone at the table!    The atmosphere in this place is relaxing, the food is unbelievable, and the service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"New Year's Eve reservations were made well in advance, but when we got there on time, the lobby was packed, people were lined up waiting, and the bar had no seating. We were told when we checked in that previous customers decided to linger and so the wait time would be about 20 mins to half an hour and that we could order a drink in the bar lounge while we waited.  Well there was absolutely no room in the bar  or anywhere else to wait, so we waited for about 20 mins lined up against a wall in the pathway of waitstaff.  People just kept  coming and waiting and waiting and waiting. If Flemings is going to take reservations, they need to honor that and not greedily overbook so that there are so many people waiting in the lobby that there is no breathing room.  I'm sure that they have done New Years Eve before and should be able to guess pretty accurately how many reservations to take. Otherwise, they should be honest and say, sorry we don't take reservations and it is on a first come serve basis so that people can plan for that. Management is really not concerned with how customers view this restaurant. Management is really not concerned with how customers view this restaurant since the manager didn't acknowledge the problem when we spoke to him  or apologize or do anything else. We used to think Fleming was a pretty good restaurant,  but we don't plan to go there again or recommend others to go there or take our out of town guests there.  It's the principle of the thing. People will hear about our experience there as we are always asked about where to eat. A word of advice to the management.  Customer service IS very important to the survival of any business."}
{"text":"Overall the experience was pleasant and I would give them 3, if not 4 stars...  However, they failed to accommodate my simple request, which was to pay the bill for the entire table (my family and our guests)....  For some reason, it was so hard for them to honor my request even though I approached them twice.   My guests ended up paying for their own meal.... unbelievable..."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and the staff is always great. The food is good, and the chocolate lava cake is the best dessert i have ever had. We never have to wait, the servers are knowledgable and ready to reccomend based on our taste, and the drinks are excellent. Try the ruby slipper, the martinis or the peach sparkler. Great service and a great atmosphere and happy hour is totally worth it. The lobster is the best in town."}
{"text":"Not really impressed.     Waitress was very goog . place was to noisy service slowGood place to eat if you are not in a hurry. I might be back  45 - 50 dollars for steak only is a bit much for me, no extras bake potato 11 dollars to much for me. French fries 10 where is the nearest mickey dees."}
{"text":"Excellent resturant. Fabulous steaks.  Great service. Good wine selection.  Excellent place to celebrate an important event.  Every time I've been here the service has been excellent.  The atmosphere is formal, but not stuffy."}
{"text":"I love this place. We always have good meals (or happy hour visits). Tonight we went to celebrate my husband's new job. We didn't go all out. But we were still treated well. That's important to us. We don't like being treated one way when we spend big bucks and another when we don't. Anyway, we had the Sunday prime rib special - an awesome deal - and bottle of wine. Our waiter was friendly and attentive but not overbearing. The pacing of our meal was good, too. Ooh, and I love the new version of the wedge salad. The tomatoes and pork belly (rather than thin bacon) were amazing.   My favorites dishes: prime rib, filet mignon, ahi tuna (small plate typically) and various specials.  Appetizers/happy hour: tenderloin carpaccio and calamari. The prime burger is awesome.  Salads: wedge and Flemings.  Sides: mac & cheese, Brussels sprouts, spinach, Fleming potatoes and asparagus.  Desserts: creme brûlée, carrot cake and chocolate lava cake.  Cocktails: blueberry lemon drop, peach whiskey martini, blackberry bramble and farmers daughter. Also, ward b or 8, but I didn't notice it this visit.  Looking forward to another visit soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our 3 year Anniversary. This was my first time dining at Fleming's so I was excited. The atmosphere was absolutely perfect. We had a reservation so we walked in and was greeted with an Anniversary card that was signed by the staff! Unbelievable! We get seated and order our drinks and meal. The service was spectacular! The food is amazing. Everything was perfect to make our night so special. The manager came to our table to greet us and wished us a Happy Anniversary. My boyfriend asked a question about his meal and noticed they left off the bacon on his steak. No big deal but the manager took care of it immediately. After we finished our meal, we got our check and our waiter gave us a $50 gift card and some gourmet chocolate! We could not believe it. Our experience was unforgettable and we plan to go back very soon! Service goes a long way and they nailed it!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for a special occasion and found the food to be just ok and the service was terrible. The waiter didn't want to be there and should not have been. I heard good things about this place so we checked it out but I will not recommend it nor will we go here again."}
{"text":"I use to visit another steak house downtown Chandler until I found Flemmings. Staff have gone above and beyond. Love this place"}
{"text":"Superb service! The food wasn't too bad either...  We ordered the spicy chili calamari. A little sweet, a little spicy...but just perfect!  Followed that up with the Main steak and a side of Fleming's potatoes (extra cheesy with jalapeños) and the specialty Parmesan crusted halibut topped with lump crab in a lemon/butter/cream sauce over sautéed spinach....DELISH!  Because it was my fiancé's bday we ordered the lava cake. Takes 20 min to make but soooo worth the wait! Request to have Alan as your server - he's on point!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan is because the service here is excellent. The servers are helpful but not overbearing (i.e. asking every 5 mins if we need anything) and if anything goes wrong - i.e. it starts raining while you're on the pation or the food is served incorrectly, the management staff is EXCELLENT in making sure you're happy.  Of course, this place is pricey but definitely worth the $.Good food, great wine and terrific servers, bartenders and managers."}
{"text":"Best tuna appetizer I have ever had.  The spicy mustard is out of this world.  When they have a corn/seafood chowder on the menu it is the best chowder you can buy.  Steaks are always great and when halibut is in season they do a terrific job.  Sides are very good.  Especially like the Flemings potatos.  When they have Beef Flemington on the menu it is also top notch.  Prices are high and worth it."}
{"text":"Wow! This Steak House is Awesome. My husband and I decided to Celebrate our Anniversary here. We both enjoyed our server \"Cody\", he was very friendly and had great knowledge of the menu. Our Steaks were cooked perfectly. The wine recommended by our server tasted exactly the way he described \"fresh and crisp\". I'm happy that my awesome husband made reservations because there was a pretty big crowd waiting for a table so if you plan on going here  reserve a table ahead of time.  Thanks for a great experience we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Can't understand how this location isn't 4 stars plus. They never disappoint and last night was no exception. Took my daughter for a nice dinner and everything was perfectly prepared, from the salads, to the prime NY Strip.  The service, as always was impeccable. Jurgen our waiter took good care of us and his colleague remembered my daughter and I - from our visit - two years ago.    In previous dinners with the wife and/or friends we've sampled virtually everything on the menu and never left unsatisfied. If you live in the SE Valley, save yourself a trip to Scottsdale for a special occasion and come here."}
{"text":"My husband brought me to Flemings on my birthday. The staff were lovely, all wishing me a 'Happy Birthday' which was a nice touch. The food itself was great. I found a lovely wine on their great wine list and my husband went with a wine recommended by the server which he enjoyed. We both had steak which was cooked as requested and to perfection. If I was to be picky, I would say the side dish of fries I had did not justify the $10 price charge. For dessert I had cheesecake which is the best I've had in a long, long time. Again the staff recognised my birthday and the cheesecake had a candle on it. When we were paying the bill I was given a lovely box of truffles and a gift voucher. Yes, it is expensive but if you have an event you are celebrating they do go that extra yard to make it a memorable occasion for you :-)"}
{"text":"flemings is always top notch. we went for the thursday night wine tasting 20 wines for $25 introducing there new 100 wines by the glass. The selection was good from lite whites to deep reds a great way to sample a portion of there new wine list. then to top it off we received $25 gift cards for dinner. so we stayed and had the AZ resturant week pre fix dinner for $39 the food was wonderful. salads, soup lamb chops and filet. i guess to sum it up you can't go wrong with a meal from flemings. they also have a great happy hour."}
{"text":"I went here as part of a business dinner and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  The service was excellent; professional and attentive, without being stuffy or pretentious.  The appetizers, salads, and sides were above average in taste and presentation.  Now, the filet mignon was the highlight of the evening.  The steak was cooked to medium-rare perfection.  If you enjoy a good steak paired with an excellent wine (they have a huge wine list), you should definitely give Fleming's a try.  I'm an out of towner who travels frequently to Chandler and this restaurant tops my list."}
{"text":"Well, the food is absolutely incredible, but the 165$ pricetag for dinner for two was a LITTLE much. The wine we had was great and we both got the surf and turf... with filet mignon of course. I would definately go there again... when I save up some money... Not a place for teachers to go. :)"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE! Absolutely worth every star every penny everything was just on point from the moment you park to the time your finishing up. Flemings made our special event just amazing and i couldnt thank them enough! The WAGYU and the ribeye are what you dream about when youre craving a steak. Ive personally never had WaGyu and was eager to try. Come celebrate a special night at flemings and you will be glad you did!! Thanks again from the Valenzuela family."}
{"text":"Had a fillet - was as good as any I've every had.  Tender, cooked to perfect temperature.  Terrific flavor.  Seafood chowder was good as far as Arizona goes.  You just don't get great chowder here.  Waitstaff was attentive, but otherwise invisible, which is exactly how I like them.    Eating here is different that most places.  Ignore the prices, I would say even ignore the menu.  Tell the waitstaff what you want, they will bring it and charge you what it costs.    If you are price shopping this place, you will not be satisfied."}
{"text":"Went out for our wedding anniversary and decided to give this location a try. Have dined at Fleming's in other states before and always enjoyed ourselves. 1st big plus is we had a reservation and our table was actually ready. Nothing irks me more than making a reservation and still having to wait 20 minutes for a table.   Service was very good. Our server Megan was very nice and knowledgable. She even called over the manager / sommelier to answer my questions about the wine list.   Food was great. My wife had the small plate scallops and they were outstanding. I had the pris fixe menu petite filet and salmon with the chili lime shrimp appetizer. Also very good and very filling. We finished with the chocolate lava cake. I'm not really a dessert guy, but it was worth it.   The only thing that keeps me from giving this location 5 stars is the bar & happy hour. The bar is very small and absolutely packed every night. Since you can only take advantage of the happy hour specials in the bar it becomes a regular mob scene by 5:00. Management needs to seriously rethink the logistics on this. They're sending a lot of potential customers next door to Roy's and the Sandbar due to poor planning.   All in all a very good experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Service was good. however, my fillet mignon was cooked well done when I ordered medium well."}
{"text":"Flemings can be a homerun restaurant or it can be in a slump.  Tonight was a slump.  Prime Rib was fine.  Potatoes were okay.  Asparagus was below average.  Bread was slightly dry and tasteless.  Crème Bruelle was great, but the berries looked worn out.  Had a reservation for a booth....younger manager placed us at a table in the middle of the restaurant since it was first come, first serve for seating according to him.  We were puzzled.  There were lots of tables along the walls, but we got the table in the center.  It was loud.  With that being said, I think eating a 5 pm is a good idea if you need a booth for privacy and quietness.  Next, do not eat their specials.  They are average.  Order off the main menu.  Last, the Chocolate Volcano cake is average.  It is not worth the extra time or money.  If in doubt about where you are seated, get up and leave.  We will do that next time.  Why make a reservation if the requests are ignored?  Tonight was an average meal at a noisy restaurant.  I can get that at Outback for less money and their quality is often better than Flemings!"}
{"text":"Had reservations for 8. Guess what..no table ready till 8:15.  Got stuck in Coffin corner. Girl friends steak came out raw..she wanted medium.  Bummer. Waiter was okay but I expected a more low key guy considering the venue. Pains me to say it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Love their Beef Flemington, good poor on wine, good wine selection, good martini's.  Great place to go."}
{"text":"First time going to Flemings and was hoping for a great experience. Unfortunately it felt like the worse financial expenditure in my life. The atmosphere was clean and elegant but the very loud and made it even hard to communicate with our server. Most of us had Chefs Special which was a filet, scallops, and shrimp. Sounds great right. Well the shrimp was tough and the scallops soft and bland more boiled than seared and the steak was well cooked but all was served warm to cold. I love small portions when every bite is exquisite but for mediocre and high prices you might as well serve a larger portion to ensure your guests at least paid for something of substance.   I never plan to return and next time I choose a steakhouse we plan on returning to the Keg. Better atmosphere, service, quality, quantity, and price. Overall a much better value then the over priced Flemings. Next time i will sit at the bar and try one of their burgers instead. I have the review 2 stars because the chipotle Mac and cheese was awesome and the carpaccio was to kill for. Everything else specifically the main courses was money down the drain."}
{"text":"5 stars pretty much speaks for itself and Flemings reputation as a prime steak house is well known, so the reason we're writing this review is to shout out that their free range lemon-rosemary brick chicken is absolutely fantastic!  One of the best entrees we've ever had.  Now it's hard to go to a steak house and order anything but steak but this particular dish is worth the sacrifice.  A full half of chicken beautifully grilled and surrounded by a dozen or more mouth-watering spinach gnocchi.  Everything was wonderful, from the bread & spreads to the creme brulee, but the star of the night was the free range chicken."}
{"text":"My group of three did the Sunday prime rib special, which includes a salad, side, and dessert. Particularly noteworthy items we tried were the bread, Caesar salad, sauteed mushrooms, cheesecake, and creme brulee.  The steaks were ordered three different ways, and all of them came out perfectly.  The hostess and servers did an excellent job in making us feel welcome and special. As someone else noted, they swap out the white napkins for black ones if your slacks or skirt are dark.  The only reason I'm not a regular diner at Fleming's is the price. It is an expensive meal, so it is a place reserved for special occasions. Thankfully, the experience is so outstanding that it justifies the cost."}
{"text":"My favorite dish is the bone-in ribeye for 2. It's a special that you have to ask for and it's usually available. The Fleming's potatoes are delicious, and the lava cake dessert is a great ending to a great meal. The wine selection is also very good."}
{"text":"The food here is great. If I was rating on the food alone it would be five stars.  The service, not so great. The hostess stand was really disorganized. We had reservations, but when we walked in there was one girl at the desk refusing to make eye contact with us or the other couple that was waiting. There were two other girls behind her but they were busy talking about whether or not to post something on facebook (really? we can hear you).  Finally the first girl looks up and says she'll be right with us. Back to staring at her computer screen. More waiting.  Once we were at the table, the server was nice, he just took a very long time to do everything. It was about 15 minutes before anyone came to our table to greet us (which at the price point of Fleming's is ridiculous) and even then it wasn't our server, it was someone else who just dropped off water glasses and said that our server would be there shortly. That was about the pace of everything else. My date and I can usually pass the time very easily but there were points where it was getting so awkward waiting for the server to show up when we could see him aimlessly wandering throughout the restaurant (yes, aimlessly, not actually doing something, I used to work in the industry, I can tell the difference between someone who is legitimately slammed and someone who is just dazed and confused).  Again, two stars because the food was SO good. Not only for dinner that night but there was so much that I had a fabulous lunch the next day as well. But really for the whole experience go to Maestros or Capital Grille."}
{"text":"I've done every prime steakhouse in the Valley (Morton's, Donovan's, Mastro's, etc) ordering the same cut each time ... Boneless ribeye, medium rare. Flemings won hands down. Service is impeccable and when you are a regular, you are remembered and treated accordingly. My favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"We celebrated my sons birthday. The lobster tails were out of this world. One of the best meals we have ever eaten, it was a little more pricey than I had expected but the overall experience was fabulous. I will return for special occasions."}
{"text":"Probably the best out of the large steak chains. Better than Ruth's Chris or Mortons hands down. The filet is amazing. They could have better sides, but let's face it, we go for the steak. We go at least two to three times a year. The customer service (wait staff and managers) are 5 STAR service. They keep us coming back. Personally my favorite steak house for high end."}
{"text":"I'm not that pleased with this experience. For the price, I expected better ambiance and better presentation. The steaks were seasoned and cooked well. Our family enjoys a good cut that's perfectly done to each person's speculations. Also the service was perfect. Our server was thoughtful and attentive, without overly interrupting when we didn't need anything. However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return. If I'm paying this much, I'd like to feel a little more pampered."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here about a month ago and we were disappointed with our meals.  I wanted to say something and my husband told me not to. But it has been bugging me ever since because we did spend a few hundred dollars here.  We definitely don't mind spending money on really good food, however, not for something that was sub par.  My rib eye steak was so fatty I was spitting out fat in every bite. I know rib eye steak is a fattier piece of steak, however, not in every bite! My husband's lobster was dry and tough. I have been telling all my friends and family about our experience letting them know that the food is not worth the price.  I keep wondering if people just go there because it's supposedly \"upscale\"-- I say not."}
{"text":"5 Stars across the board. Made the reservation online for a small celebration for a 60th Wedding Anniversary for 4 people. We were running late and called the restaurant twice to change our reservation times; Jessica and Gabrielle were very accommodating and took care of it immediately. The valet Matthew was outstanding. We got seated right away with the awesome Jason and Julia waiting on us. The Calamari, Mushroom Ravioli and Crab Cakes were amazing. Jason recommended a  Merlot from their iPad wine list and it was great. The New England Clam Chowder and the Caesar Salads with the anchovies were fresh and tasty. Bread was warm and replenished right away.  Entrees were cooked perfectly with juicy NY strip steaks  and big scallops, served hot. The side garlic mashed potatoes were delicious. For dessert we got the Creme Brule with the chantilly cream and it was to die for. The manager Bruce stopped by to wish the anniversary couple and see how we were doing, and our waiter presented the couple of the evening with a box of truffles and a $25 gift card, which was a very nice and classy touch. Great ambiance, fantastic food and wonderful attentive service. I have eaten at the Scottsdale location and this one is just better and warmer. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"Very comparable service to other locations I've been to. No complaints, great service, and delicious food. We went on Thanksgiving since it's just my husband and I, and it was packed!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Just went here and ordered the petite filet and lobster tail, everything is so good here. I also love the pork chop! My favorite dessert is the lava cake hot and yummy."}
{"text":"I would have given it less but they did comp our bad meal. Ordered filet with crab stuffed prawns and the stuffing tasted like it had been left out. The manager (who never gave her name) tried to tell me that they where fine to eat. They really undercooked my husbands steak and desert was served in a very dirty bowl.  We went in because we had gift cards. I guess we will be giving it another try."}
{"text":"My mother and I love Fleming's happy hour menu, great food and drinks at a reasonable price.  We usually start our mother/daughter fun outing nights at Fleming's before going to the movies or to an event together.  I've equally enjoyed their dinner menu while celebrating birthdays or while on a date night. I highly recommend their filet Mignon and any of their side dishes. If you visit during their happy hour, get the burger and any one of their martini's."}
{"text":"While the steak was amazing it was my least favorite part of the meal. The cold seafood starter was the best I've had in Arizona. The salad and sides were so delicious I couldn't stop eating them even after I was full. Wine and champagne were the best I've had.   But who am I kidding. Lava. Cake. I would go back just for dessert. We had to fight for the last gooey bite!  The staff is high end, attentive, professional, and polite."}
{"text":"My hubby and I ate here earlier tonight. We made an early (5pm) reservation so we could squeeze in a movie post dinner. Since they open at 5, we figured we would be the first people inside. Much to our surprise it was packed with happy hour patrons. It must be a good one, so we will come back another time to try it.  Leave it to us, though, to dine at a steakhouse and both order seafood. I had the lobster tails and they were amazing. My hubby enjoyed his salmon and said it was some of the best he had ever had. We also had asparagus and the Flemings potatoes. Both were great!   Service was impeccable. We will definitely go back for seconds ;)"}
{"text":"Went there for our anniversary and was very pleased! The food was terrific as well as the mixed drinks! We got a peach cocktail and it tasted delicious! We both got an 8 ounce sirloin along with a baked potato and it was awesome! The baked potato definitely sealed the deal!  The manager came over and gave us some truffles to take home along with a gift card for our anniversary! It is expensive but very nice and romantic for a special occasion! Really awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill big time! 2 attempts at a medium rare steak resulted in one overcooked to well, the last being rare with a cold, cold center. Basically, they seared the last one!  I guess the Costco gift cards, etc has relegated this steakhouse to mediocrity. Welcome to Chandler!"}
{"text":"Very upscale and nice. Valet only on weekends and the food is great. The bartender remembers me even if I havent been in months. The steak and seafood tower are the best. Expect to spend some money here."}
{"text":"The food here is great with a nice atmosphere! A great place for a very nice dinner. A nice place to have in my own back yard of chandler and not having to drive to Scottsdale for the same quality."}
{"text":"My wife and I like this place. A lot.  Most people know about their happy hour, it is one of the best around.  Make sure you get on their email list. Some of their \"off menu\" specials are a good excuse to have a fun night out.  Friendly service and really good food and wine. This place is always a good choice for dinner. Steak, lobster, scallops, cooked to perfection or they will certainly make it right.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This a review highlighting Flemings Event hosting skills-  I had a luncheon/seminar here on yesterday and was thoroughly impressed with both the outstanding quality of food and excellent service. Flemings was closed to the public during this event because they open at dinner hours. Although the restaurant was not officially opened all of the employees still kept the same level of service as if it was; as a matter of fact I was graciously greeted by a hostess upon arrival. The actual meeting room was sectioned off in the rear of the restaurant, this would make a great place for any after wedding rehearsal dinner, seminar/luncheon, or even possibly an upscale bridal shower. The wait staff was very friendly moved stealthily to each table during the seminar which is very important (nobody wants to hear a bunch of plates clinking when you're trying to listen to a presentation). On to the food! The salad was pre-chosen by the host which was Fresh Mozzarella & Sweet Cherry Tomato- one word to describe it would be \"AMAZING\"! The tomatoes were perfectly sweet and paired so well with the creamy FRESH mozzarella, I literally thought about this dish when I was on my way to sleep for the night. For dinner attendees at the seminar had the choice of chicken, salmon and of course steak. My co-workers and I all decided to try something different so we could compare. I had the Chicken and was impressed by juiciness and the mushroom chutney it was served with. The Salmon looked delectable and received high praise as well as the Petite Filet Mignon. All the entrees came with fresh Sautéed Green Beans and Fleming's Potatoes (think of the best scallops you've ever eaten, now times that greatness by 10 and you'll have Fleming's Potatoes).  The seminar concluded with a Cheesecake that was sent straight from the Cheesecake gods (it was a huge piece and I was already full but I somehow made room for it!). The Cheesecake was rich, creamy and lightly topped with blueberries (I can't believe I had to go back to work after that feast!). This was my first time at Fleming's I will be sure to come back during normal operating hours so I can try even more of the amazing menu. Bravo Chef and Staff!"}
{"text":"First off, they didn't offer us the restaurant week menu.. lost a star for that.   After hearing such good things about this place my lady I decided to check it out.   1.) Took at least 15mins for our waiter to come introduce himself. 2.) Not a fun atmosphere at all. The booths we sat in felt like we were on display and far from comfortable. 3.) Calamari was awesome, enjoyed that very much win for them. 4.) When the food eventually came out I said to myself, \"this is going to amazing!!\" I mean it had to be, the presentation was on point like Ruth's Chris or Mastro's and it smelled great. I was wrong so very wrong. I don't think this restaurant believes in flavor. 1 steak was severely undercooked and 1 steak was over cooked and tough.  5.) The sides-- the mac and cheese was close but no cigar. The twice cut fries looked and smelled good but tasted like sonic fries with zero salt. 6.) Our free dessert lacked luster and the expensive ass food was anything but spectacular. I need to go back to Mastro's and have the butter cake  My advice if you're looking for a really good meal go to Ruth,s Mastro's, or Steak 44 this place is weak."}
{"text":"Ask for Jurgen (like the Jergen lotion)  Reservations were easy, got the time we wanted.  My husband and I went for my birthday, we were greeted and seated with a signed birthday card, nice touch.  We had a few minutes to look at the menu then we were greeted by our server Jurgen.  Asked us what to drink, we wanted a bottle of red wine and made a wonderful recommendation.  Brought water and delicious sourdough bread and a couple of different butters (very tasty and rich!)  My husband loves salads but Jurgen recommended the clam chowder.  We got both and split them!  The salad was pretty good but the clam chowder was to DIE FOR!!!  Perfectly seasoned.  We both ordered steaks, with rubs, their potatoes and the Brussel sprouts.  All fabulous!  My husband didn't realize that a sauce came ON his steak.  He's not a sauce guy so we mentioned it to Jurgen so the manager came over.  We weren't complaining but the manager asked if my husband wanted another steak, no questions, over sauce!  Amazing.  He said no, but we got dessert for free instead.  Really?  Yes!  What a way to stand behind your product.  The other manager stopped by as well, just to check on us and chat for a minute and to wish me a happy birthday.  The gal that was taking care of us as well was very attentive but not overbearing.  She impressed us also.  Though it was expensive it was so worth it.  Oh, did I mention Jurgen gave us truffles as well?  What a fabulous meal.  We will definitely go back for the next special occasion."}
{"text":"Service was slow, never got bread, and the halibut special wasn't anything to brag about.  Halibut never really tastes fishy but when you cover it up with a weird white sauce and throw crab on it you might as well put cod on the plate.  Just not what you would expect from a $100+ dollar meal.  Check out the flemmings potatoes though.  It's a glimmer of hope, even though an extremely small portion for a \"family style\" portion."}
{"text":"Super pricey, great cuts of meat, steaks cooked perfectly. Dress is casual.  Valet parking service is great!    Expect to pay about $50 per person before drinks.    We have 4 drinks.  2 filets and 2 sides, $225 later we walked out stuffed"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently went to Flemings for her birthday.  Anytime we decide to spend a bit more on a nice dinner Flemings is our first choice.  You know every time you go there you will receive first rate service and 5 star food.  There is not a bad item on the menu there and the steaks are fantastic.    The only thing I would say the location lacks is the bar.  While they do have one, it is very small and gets full quite quickly.  We would love to go there more to enjoy some of the food on the happy hour menu but given how it is set up, we opt for other locations.  The dining room itself is very spacious and representative of a high end dining experience.    One thing that always cracks me up there is how they offer to carry my drink for me when walking me to be seated in the dining room.  May have to actually do that sometime...."}
{"text":"We went for a date night with my boyfriend on a Monday night. It was much fancier than I had anticipated. I felt a little under dressed in jeans and flip flops. We had zoe as our server and she was great. We ordered the sea bass, the filet and the flemings potatoes. Everything tasted great but I thought the filet portion was a little small."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I'm usually a huge fan of Fleming's. I've gone to the Scottsdale and Lincoln location quite a few times, and have received nothing but stellar service each of those visits. Tonight, I cannot say the same about the Chandler location.   Let's begin by Brittany (our server) coming to take our drink orders... It took close to 20 minutes (18 to be exact) to receive our drinks. We hadn't seen our server and was wondering where she had went, so we had asked a near by server if he can find out where Brittany was because our table was ready to order. Long story longer... A girlfriend of mine had ordered a $155 bottle of Caymus, the server had her sample it, and my girlfriend told the server the wine needed to be filtered. Brittany disregard what we had requested and poured it into a glass pitcher (can't think of the name for container she poured the wine in) and never came back. We finally had to tell the young gal that was helping Brittany serve the table we wanted the wine to be filtered because of the sediment. This gal kept challenging us... Stating why didn't we tell Brittany this in the beginning... And we told her we did, but she never came back to do it. Mind you, there was 3/4 of the bottle left, it was not like anyone drank the bottle and demanded anything for free. My boyfriend who is in the restaurant industry... A GM of a restaurant in North Scottsdale would not have let something like this slip without touching the table. No manager came to touch on the table as this was an on-going challenge of the night. This went on for the majority part of our visit until we watched the manager  go into the wine cellar with our other server to grab another bottle we had requested.   Point is, no one touched the table. Despite of the challenge for the night with the wine, you would've at least expect a manager to come by because no one had taken responsibility for such poor service we left quite disappointed... Can't expect a decent tip if you do not receive decent service. I think holding yourself ACCOUNTABLE is a major issue at tonight's visit. No accountability whatsoever. I highly suggest someone in charge reading, 'Leaders Eat Last'. It's a great read on leadership.   Tonight's visit left a really bad taste in my mouth. Very poor service! Brittany did not return to our table as she left it for the other gal to take care of us. I know how intimidating and frustrating it can be to serve, because I myself have served for 5 years while going through college, but at a place like Fleming's I don't see why you cannot be successful when all the tools you need are right in front of you. Being in the service industry isn't for everyone, it takes a lot of patience, and customer service skills. You work in this industry to be of at service to people no matter how bad a night is going.  Do not have any reasons to return."}
{"text":"my filet medium-rare was cooked perfectly, my husband  had filet with  oscar style crab asparagus and Bearnaise sauce.  I thought he was going to lick the plate. Caesar salad and clam chowder to start. probably one of the best experiences and food that I've ever had, absolutely nothing to complain about. our 5 year wedding anniversary was acknowledged several times by the waiter and the floor manager who came around and knew us by name, how awesome for a first-time experience! they also give you dessert which was a molten lava chocolate cake with fresh whipped cream and berries with little vanilla wafers. I almost cried that's how good it tasted. they give you a little box of chocolate truffles that I have yet to try and $25 off your next visit, worth every Penny of. our $250 Bill. a must-try for your special occasion!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were celebrating my recent job promotion and our two year anniversary. I must say that the service is what will bring me back again for other celebrations. We had a wonderful server, and were greeted by the manager who congratulated us. The ambiance is very nice for special occasions and anniversaries, however if you wanted to catch the football game or baseball game, you could eat at the bar area. The noise from the bar area does not carry into the fine dining area.   We both ordered a Caesar salad, the filet mignon and lobster tail, and for dessert we shared the chocolate lava cake AND the cheesecake. Their prices are fair - it's a fine dining establishment. The filet mignon was cooked exactly how I wanted it, and the lobster was delicious. Needless to say, I will be looking forward to celebrating at this Fleming's again."}
{"text":"So here's the thing, had dinner here the other night and the food was very good. I'm a little over steaks cooked in a 1600 degree oven though and would love to find a place where they actually cook steaks over wood so you get the nice charred marks.. nonetheless the food is good, especially the sides. However, the sides are ridiculously overpriced. We tried their lobster bisque which was delicious, but $14.95 for a cup of soup? The crab cake appetizer was $19.95, salads and all potato and veggies are all about $12. Yes you can share and again everything we had was very good, but still...yikes.  Speaking of their steaks, I would say if you order the ribeye be sure and inquire as to how thick it is. My ribeye came out not even an inch thick and looked like a steamed breakfast steak. I did turn it back and they were very gracious about it.  I simply shared with my dinner date which was more than enough and it was fine because really the rest of the food was fabulous.  We had great service and notice a number of Captains walk around making sure everything was going smoothly."}
{"text":"We really enjoy going to Flemings's. I have always had great food and a perfectly prepared steak. I really like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I recently dined here and did not have a good experience. I dine at steakhouses frequently, Hillstone group, capital grille etc. and this place has never been comparable. My filet had no sear, my boyfriends dad's fish was over cooked, the creamed spinach was like soup, burrata was a joke and the sautéed spinach was over salted. There pour on glasses of wine are quite small too, no different ounce options. For the prices, go to Capital Grille! Pretty disappointing, especially the waiter with the southern accent giving us attitude for complaining about the soupy creamed spinach and not wanting to order there chocolate lava cake, lol. Chandler is pretty disappointing with there options of restaurants. Not worth the drive."}
{"text":"We've previously dined here before and had a great time but I guess they've gone downhill since then (or at least this location). There's no valet :( we waited a few min before we were sat at a booth, we let our server know we would need a steak to go and she advised us to order it after we get out meal.We started out with the carpaccio and pork belly, the carpaccio is still the best in town but the pork was dry and underwhelming at best. The salads followed we had the Caesar (great flavor) and Flemings (very bland). This is where the bad starts my husbands NY strip was cooked properly but mine and my friends were not I ordered med rare ( I received med well) my friend ordered med (got med rare) I sent mine back, the server was not happy with that. After 15 min I got my new steak done right, at this point the rest of the table were finished eating so we ordered dessert and reminded our server we wanted a meal to go and our check because we had to leave soon. She seemed very busy and I had to flag down another server to pay our bill, after 25-30 min we finally had our meal and could leave. Bottom line I think next time we want a good steak we'll go to the Scottsdale location or City Hall!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are frequent customers of the Chandler location steakhouse.  Normally we have always been satisfied with service and meal.  We usually spend 180.00 - 200.00....  Last week we ordered the King Crab Legs and was terribly disappointed.  The quality was much like what you would get at a casino buffet if not less.   When I complained to, I presumed the Manager, she kindly brought an additional half order to our table and they looked identical to my original order.  It's as though they scraped the bottom of the pot for these sad little legs.  The presentation was horrible.   My husbands rib eye for the first time was not cooked properly and the quality of the beef had so much gristle and way too much marbling there was little left that was palatable.  What's up here!!   We may have to drive into Phoenix or Scottsdale for a quality steak.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Our dinner last night at the Chandler Flemings was excellent. The bacon wrapped filets w/tempura shrimp were cooked to perfection and may become a favorite for us. Whether it's a full dinner or the fabulous bar menu, this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and all three times the food has been amazing. Usually service is equally amazing but tonight our server was really bad he was un attentive forgot about us while he served other tables with service we usually get. If you go and your server is named Jason. ..move to another area."}
{"text":"New to the area and I stopped in after a long day at work to relax and enjoy a burger. Wow, spectacular food. Service is another why the less than stellar review. I waited standing for 40 minutes for a spot in the bar area and they clearly saved a.spot for someone who came in 15 minutes after I waited. I had asked if anyone was sitting  in the spot he went to and was told yes by the bar staff...not true because I watched the man come in and ask of there was room.at the bar....the spot i asked for was maniacally available...ugh. But still, I am glad I waited. Very rarely do I eat meat... this was perfect and Brandon was a great server.... I'll be back. Only suggestion... bar staff be honest and more personable... kind of nonchalant and for AZ that's normally not the case."}
{"text":"My wife took to me to Flemming's to celebrate my 31st birthday this Wednesday.  What a pleasurable experience we had.  Everyone from the hostess to server to bus boys were extremely nice and inviting.  An example of the service we received can be summed up by this.  They offered to bring me dessert for my birthday, once finding out I was gluten free they provided me with a key lime truffle covered in toasted coconut instead of cake.  Ugh, impressed I was.    The food was remarkable.  Their new Porcini Filet Mignon was out of this world.     Go to Flemming's and enjoy.  The next thing for us to get to is the happy hour."}
{"text":"We had a most enjoyable dinner at Fleming's. The staff was very friendly and polite. The meal was so yummy - I didn't want to stop eating.  The young lady who seated us was very sweet and warm. Mark (our waiter) was helpful and prompt. Conner (who assisted Mark) always kept bread and water on the table- and cleared off dirty plates quickly. The manager came over and checked on us (we told him how well we were being taken care of). We were impressed with the young man who valet parked our car (missed his name). Very friendly and enjoyed chatting with him a few minutes. Of course, compliments to the chefs for the best seabass and mashed potatoes I have ever eaten....the cream brulee was so yummy.  Thanks for a wonderful evening... Your staff is awesome...."}
{"text":"I had heard that this was a good fancy restaurant to go to so I took my parents here when they came to visit town and I must say that I was dissappointed. The cost for 3 people was exorbitant for the quality. We are not a family that minds spending a little for excellent food but this meal did not meet the standard for the amount our meal was for three people.  The portions of the appetizers we shared were tiny. I think we had three pieces of ravioli in the ravioli dish which was not much. My steak left a pile of inedible gristle that filled a quarter of my plate and I don't even usually mind a little fat which adds flavour.  It was clearly not edible but the waiter asked me 'aren't you going g to eat that?' 'Uh..that's a no.' For the price I would not go there again. Too expensive for mid level quality. I would prefer somewhere like the keg where I have had far better food at a better value."}
{"text":"I agree with David M and Ada G. regarding the service in the bar. If you go here, do not dine in the bar. The hostess might tell you its full service at the bar but the service at the bar is noticeably lacking. If you have a choice between waiting for a table and eating at the bar, eat at the table.  We were rushed, not all of our food was packed to go, water not refilled without asking (and waiter never apologized for failing to refill drinks), steak knives were not brought with the food, bread was not brought out without asking, had to ask for refill on wine (since when has a waiter not asked for refill on alcoholic drinks)...all of the usual amenities that are provided at table service was severely lacking at the bar.  The other aspect that annoyed me was that I asked for fried onion strings or straws on my steak and asked if they could prepare it. The server immediately got defensive and acted as if I was asking  foie gras on the side. Instead of simply responding with \"It shouldn't be a problem, I'll see what we can do\" His response was remniscient of a server at Applebees \"Well since we don't offer that item on the menu, I just don't know if they can make that\" Seriously, was I dining at Black Angus? It's called common sense, I can understand that response if I was asking for something other than fried onion strings. Very amateur to say the least!  The food itself is amazing at this location. They reall cook steaks well and if you order a medium, it comes perfectly cooked with mostly pink inside and just a little charred on the outside. It's one of the few places that really understand what a medium steak is and they don't overcook it like most places.  I like their steaks better than many more well known places including Donovans and Ruth Chris.  The service needs to improve even at the tables. You don't receive that royal treatment like you do at other upscale steak restaurants including Ruth Chris, Donovan's etc. I can understand that type of service if I'm dining at Outback Steakhouse but we just spent $167 for two and were formally and professionally dressed yet we were rushed as if we were eating at Chipotle during lunch rush hour.  The service needs to improve especially for a fine dining establishment. The basics like refilling drinks, smiling, addressing people as sir/mam, apologizing if items are forgotten are basic elements of good service at a fine dining restaurant yet it was lacking here. If you want an example of great service, go to Durants"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 12, we called ahead and they were able to get us sat all together and we didn't have to wait at all. We were able to arrive before our reservation and immediately sit down.   I ordered the dry aged rare rib-eye with asparagus and a Caesar Salad.  Steak was cooked perfectly, and melted in my mouth. I am pretty sure I could cut the steak with a fork and not even chew if I wanted to.   For desert I had the cheesecake and it was your typical New York style cheesecake, was delicious and the right consistency.    Overall the meal was a little pricey, but I did opt for a dry aged steak and full 3 course meal."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience the first time my husband and I came here. We were treated like we had no money and our card would bounce. Had we not been given a gift card we wouldn't have come back. Mark was our server this time around and was down to earth and didn't talk down to us (my husband has a beard, that doesn't mean we're poor come on look at Duck Dynasty) he made us feel really welcome here and not like we were outcasts. Next time we come we are asking for MARK!"}
{"text":"Thursday night..... Busy!  Bartenders never acknowledged us even after looking at us multiple times. I guess they think they make enough money. Cocktail table opened up after 10 minutes. The male cocktail server did a fantastic job in letting us know of specials and his opinions of the wine and apps and taking care of us--kudos!  Dinner table opened up (20 minutes after our reservation but no big deal at all-- busy).  Megan waited on us and was very good too.  EXTREMELY Loud and Noisy inside (I forgot that since its been years since I was back).  Megan did great at explaining recommendations of all the questions we had w/ the food and wine. Only issue on service was they never brought out our 3 sauces we asked for and were part of the meal.  The steaks $57 and $55 each were good but not fantastic at all and not worth $50+. It seems prices increased about 20% since last time there and not worth it for the good but not great food and the wine prices (happy hour has good prices though).  Spending $250 for two was too high for the food quality we got and the very loud ambience.  Service was very good though other than the bt's.  I'll stick w/ Ruth and Chris, Capital One or Maestros in future."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was a little different from what we expected.  It is much more relaxing and casual than the ones we've been to in L.A.  The waiter was very polite and funny at the same time.  He seemed relieved and excited to serve our table since we were the only under 50 table in the whole restaurant.  *Steaks = very yummy.  cooked to perfection.   *Decor = a little on the vintage side *Service = wonderful"}
{"text":"Amazing from start to finish. It is very pricey but you truly get what you pay for, delectable and delicious. Great service, food, and wine."}
{"text":"Awesome service. I'm not one for uncomfortable snooty dining, and this restaurant made me feel very relaxed and comfortable. Food was good and well presented"}
{"text":"The service at this location is not what one would expect at an upper end steakhouse or any fine dining establishment.  This was my third visit to this location and the service level and attentiveness of the wait staff is not on par with other Fleming's or what it should be for the price point.   Perhaps as one of the few upper end dining options in the area, they just can't get a decent staff since the area is cluttered with chain casual dining restaurants.    This place really needs to try harder and step it up and give people a level of service they expect for what they are paying."}
{"text":"This is the perfect example of an upscale steakhouse. Amazing service, amazing meats and seafood cooked exactly the way you like It, huge sides to share for the table, and desserts that are impossible not to make room for.   Fleming's has always been a go to for special occasions of any kind and they are sure to make you leave feeling special.   Pricey? Yes. Worth It? Yes."}
{"text":"It was okay.  For the price,  I would not go back.  The soup and salad were excellent, the steak was nothing special.  The service was good, but not great.  The support staff was better than the actual server, although the actual server was very nice and friendly.  Finally, and most important, it was LOUD.  I mean if I say I said \"what?\" once to the person sitting across the table from me I said it 100 times during the meal.  If you are looking for a quiet restaurant to share a nice meal, go to Scottsdale to Ruth Chris.  (I have to say, I am a Ruth Chris fan and went here to try something new)."}
{"text":"Get the summer pairing of a filet and salmon with the chile lime prawns-best salmon I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go when we don't want to cook or BBQ ; calamari and burger ate to fast for pictures"}
{"text":"My wife and I have gone to this location a few times for our anniversary. It is a wonderful place the staff are always very kind to us and the service is wonderful. The steaks are usually on point and very good cuts all though it seems this time past time it was very average. Maybe the have changed the steaks?? There was no \"wow what a great steak\" feeling, we both get the aged NY steak medium. Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to knock the place just giving you our review on this particular night Nov. 21st 2016"}
{"text":"I have visited a Flemings a few times over the years and I am always satisfied.  I usually go with my husband's family on Sundays to take advantage of their Prime Rib deal.  I always enjoy visiting.  They always have great steaks and amazing sides.  I haven't been for happy hour but I heard it's pretty good."}
{"text":"The prime burger was absolutely amazing! I visited this location on 10/2/2012 with my sister-in-law and parents.  First ever visit ti Fleming's as I live out of state.    The only (2) two complaints that I have: the prime burger is a whooping 1105 calories (and I'm not even sure if this includes the special sauce and the two onion rings that are served on the side). It's my fault I should've asked the server since the caloric intake is not listed on the menu.  Second issue, how many times do you have to ask a server for straws until you get frustrated. Also, wouldn't you think that an empty glass of water means \" please fill up my glass\". Come on servers this is a high end establishment. Get it together!!!!! Very frustrating!"}
{"text":"We came back with other friends. Some things were better, noise, for example.  My prime rib was tough but the rest of the meal was fine. Drinks arrived on schedule or not unreasonably behind schedule.  I like the wine by the glass and was thrilled to find Colby red blend which I love. The dessert I ordered was not delivered but a couple of minutes later was.   My wife had no problems.  A friend ordered coffee with dessert but they had run out so he had to wait.  Waitress was nice but maybe overwhelmed.  Since we had the Sunday night prime rib special the price was high but not larcenous. This is not priced as high as the top steakhouses but shouldn't go higher.  It is not in the same league."}
{"text":"We brought our mothers to Fleming's for Mother's Day. We have been many times in the past and really enjoyed everything- food, wine, service. This time was different as it seems Fleming's has made some changes. I will start with a positive. Our waiter Nathan was fantastic! Very sweet and knowledgeable and took good care of us. All the staff was professional and provided good service.  To start with the rest, they have always had an amazing wine list but for some reason they cut WAY back on the number of choices for a glass of wine. There was not one thing on the glass of wine menu that I was interested in. Three of the salads were great, but one had less than acceptable lettuce on the plate. The onion soup was good.  The top it off lump crab was not good at all! It was very disappointing. The steaks were ok, but nothing like they used to be. I had never had a less than perfect steak there before. Overall, an awfully hefty bill for a meal that did not equal up to that:-((((("}
{"text":"I was kind of surprised that this place wasn't to my expectations, it is really nice inside great Ambience but they had not given their full potential I believe. the waiters were kind of slacking on refilling drinks and asking if there was  Anything else that we needed they had us just waiting around the whole time. The steaks were not that great neither. Maybe it was a bad day"}
{"text":"Would love to give this place a better rating, but the initial prime rib both my wife and I received was something a Sizzler would be embarrassed to serve. It was incredibly stringy and tough to the point of being impossible to eat. To their credit, once I complained they brought out two new cuts that were very good. Cooked perfectly and tender although under-seasoned. But it made me wonder about how those initial cuts could get through the quality control process. I mean, they were ridiculously awful.  I thought about it being the $29 prime rib special and that's what they give people and then hope they don't complain, but I don't think they would play with their reputation like that. On the plus side, the Flemings potatoes, bread, salad and cheesecake were awesome, but it's time we try a different steakhouse."}
{"text":"Spent our first wedding anniversary at Fleming's this evening.  This was an impromptu reservation made the same day and we were happy they could accommodate us at such a late notice.  For us, it came simply down to the ambiance.  Jordan, our server was wonderful despite her having to shout over the noise.  So if you are looking for an intimate dinner for two this isn't it.  However, our food was delicious...steak perfectly done, great halibut and Fleming's salad was quite nice.  A glass of an awesome Moscato left no room for dessert but received a token of congratulations for our special day which was beautifully presented and greatly appreciated.  Yep...the prices are high...figure on $45+ per person.  We thought it warranted the price but the ambiance could use a definite boost to cater to a more perhaps private dining experience rather than having to shout to speak to one another."}
{"text":"I needed to submit a receipt to be reimbursed and I looked EVERYWHERE with no luck. I called Flemings and within minutes my original receipt popped in my e-mail. Service at this place its truly impressive."}
{"text":"Okay everyone let's start off with price this is not a place you're going to walk out the door without spending pretty much close to $100 per person  so if that something you consider when you're going out don't eat here. OK enough said about that, the service here is phenomenal excellent wait staff excellent food my wife went here for her birthday and had a great time we stuck to small plates not because we were worried about cost but we like to eat smaller portions and I am NOT one to really go for a $60 steak I do believe that's a bit on the high side. We started off with a spinach salad that was outstanding and I had the soup of the day which was a leek soup which was really one of the best I've ever had for the main course we had a short rib and a shrimp and scallop dish both wonderfully prepared actuall  did have a good bottle of wine and topped off with the creme brulee I understand that there molten lava cake is something to be seen but we're creme brulee fans and it was again perfectly prepared and enough for two the same is true of their side dishes   again the service was outstanding the waiter was attentive without being overly bearing this is a perfect place for an anniversary or birthday it's certainly not going to be your Thursday night steak joint but highly recomend for special treat."}
{"text":"I went to Fleming's again just before Christmas on 12/23 and the service was not up to par. I was disappointed with the hostess' attitude when she scolded us for not being right in the lobby when are name was called. CHECK YOUR ATTITUDE MISSY. We almost left just because of her but the food is still satisfying so we stuck around despite the poor service of the hostess and the \"okay' service of the server who forgot to bring us our beer. Still no complaints about the awesome food."}
{"text":"We went for date night on a Saturday evening.  They sat us in the back room which gave us a little bit more privacy, tables are very nicely spaced so you can't hear the next table's conversation and the back room keeps the noise from the main area muffled.  Staff were all very friendly, didn't feel rushed at all.  Food was amazing (though the stakes came out the wrong way round and my partner salted his to death before we noticed this mistake).  We'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love Fleming's happy hour!  It is a nice atmosphere with smokin' deals on decent wine and drinks and great appetizers. There is also a very tasty burger on the happy hour menu.  The service is usually excellent."}
{"text":"Great steaks! We had the filet minion last night and it was cooked perfectly! The staff was very nice as well. This is a great place for a nice night out. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"GREAT food!  We had a Valentine's reservation for 9:45, since that was all that was available.  I called around 8pm to see if we could get a seat earlier.  I was told, \" we are booked for the night.\"  We showed up at 9pm and were seated immediately.  There were MANY empty seats.  I am not sure what the deal was with seating us earlier.  The food was INSANE good.  We each got a filet. We got a backed potato and Fleming's potatoes.  I am not sure why we got them, since we were so stuffed and had to get them to go.  We got the chocolate lava cake for dessert.  It was good, not great.  It tasted burned.  We got the calamari for an appetizer. They were slightly soggy.  The wine was great.  The service was great.  Overall, VERY GOOD.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Pricey but always a great steak!  We came here for a family celebration and even though the place was full of business diners, we received good service.  We started with the chilled seafood tower which while pricey, was excellent.  This was followed by salads and I have to say that I preferred the\"old\" Wedge versus the New Wedge. The previous Wedge was the best that I have had anywhere and was just the right combination of flavors and crispy iceberg lettuce.  Steaks (Filets and Prime Ribeyes)  were tender, moist, and cooked to perfection.  Personally, I just prefer the high-temperature broiling method that Flemings uses to cook their steaks versus an open-flame/grilling approach. One diner had Seabass which fresh and tender. Sides (grilled asparagus, Fleming's potatoes, and creamed spinach) are always fresh and flavorful and among the best I've had anywhere.  The Raymond Napa Valley Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon was a nice value accompaniment with the steaks.  Crème Brulée was excellent and the Chantilly cream is just sinful.  A great place for special occasion."}
{"text":"I will say this place was awesome. Wait staff was great very friendly. Wished my wife and I a happy 21st anniversary and all. Food was like no other. I had a certified angus prime rib which was out of this world . I would recommend this to anyone who is into great steaks. The appetizer was bacon cover in maple syrup and Jack Daniels which again was awesome. Don't just take my word for it go and try it out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here for our 25th anniversary dinner. The atmosphere is pleasant with excellent service. Unfortunately, the food itself was only okay.   They make their food with special twists, like champagne and merlot infused butters with their bread. It's unique and fun to try but the bread itself was nothing special, we would've preferred regular butter with good bread. The Caesar salad has fried capers and prosciutto chips on it. Again, it sounds incredible and was good but nothing I'd crave. Creme Brûlée - ditto although the Chantilly cream was excellent.    I will say our filet mignons were cooked perfectly and served piping hot. My husband didn't prefer the flavor of the seared edges but I thought it was good (not great).   All in all, I wouldn't mind if someone wanted to meet here but I'd probably prefer The Keg."}
{"text":"First of all let me say that the only reason I am not giving this a 5 is a because the bar area is rather small and you have to strategically plan to get here early and scout a seat. I came with my all male Co workers and we had a great time. Drinks were strong, prime rib burger was on point and I definitely plan to come again. I love that the happy hour menu strayed away from the norm, pizza or wings...had a great time but get there early or be prepared to stand around and watch others have a great time"}
{"text":"I was visiting town on a business trip and we stopped into Fleming's for a mid-week dinner.  The visit wasn't a complete flop, but close to it...  If the ribeye was in fact a \"prime\" ribeye, they did one heck of a job cooking all of the flavor out of it.  To mask the horrible grill work, they covered the steak with more salt that was necessary for the entire cow.  I've been lucky enough to dine an a wide array of steak houses that claim to serve \"prime\" steak, and this is the bottom of the list.  I would not recommend this restaurant for a large group as the atmosphere is quite loud.  We had six people at our table and a conversation that included everyone was not possible.  To end on a positive note, the servers and wait staff were terrific.  They are easily on-par with other prime steakhouses around the country.  Regarding the item on the menu that I enjoyed the most was the sweet chili calamari."}
{"text":"Plan on paying top dollar for your meal, but, you will get your money's worth. Prime steaks and high quality seafood. Service is excellent. Great place for that special occasion. Bar is intimate. Have eaten here numerous times over the years. They have maintained a high level of quality and service during all these stops."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite and glass of wine, came out happy. Would be five stars if the glass wine list was better."}
{"text":"Go to place for special occasion.  Just don't count calories.  Expect great    Steaks, extensive wine list, tasty apps and save some room for desert.  Bone in ribeye is one of the best.  Mash is always seasoned perfectly.   Very good service as well.  Only downside is the large bill at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Having been to Fleming's before, I was really looking forward to tonight's visit to celebrate a special event.  We had a reservation and were seated right away in the dark and fairly crowded room. Our table seemed exceptionally small for our party of four, which made dish and glass placement a little tricky, and during the evening my chair was bumped a few times by the waitstaff and guests because the tables were so close together. We started with crab cakes, slab-cut bacon, and lobster bisque, all of which were quite good.  There was a mix up with my drink order, and even after attempting to correct it, I still received the wrong drink. Then, we waited and waited and waited for our entrees.  3 of the 4 steaks were ordered medium well, 2 of which arrived medium rare.  After the long wait, we were in no hurry to send them back.   Our favorite sides were the chipotle mac and cheese and the Fleming's potatoes, which don't look particularly appetizing when they're served in a rectangular brick, but which tasted fantastic!  We could have passed on the Yukon mashed potatoes and asparagus we ordered as neither were particularly remarkable.    We finished off with creme brulee served with whipped cream and fresh berries, which came out right away and was just as wonderful and creamy  as I remembered it being here.  Overall, the dinner was nice, but it didn't feel quite like the celebration dinner we'd hoped for."}
{"text":"My family comes here regularly. We like to come on Sundays for the prime rib dinner - $40 for prime rib, salad, a side, and dessert. I normally get the Fleming's salad and Fleming's potatoes and then end with the lava cake (so good!). It's a more expensive restaurant, but they have really good steak."}
{"text":"My wife and I met 2 friends at the bar for some happy hour and dinner action last night.  It was about 6:30 and I think we snagged just about the last open table.    I was pretty impressed with their happy hour selections and prices.  The ladies had glasses of wine and the guys had a Kettle martini with blue cheese olives (my absolute fav!).  The martini was excellent especially because it was 6 bucks.  The wine pour was a bit skimpy though.  The 4 of us shared the crab cake appetizer and it was excellent and will definitely order it again.  For an entree I ordered the sliced fliet mignon burger sans bun.  It is exactly as it sounds; basically a sliced filet mignon.  It was pretty thick so I have no idea how people actually eat the thing on a bun.  Anyway it was excellent as well as good sized.  I would order it again but I keep reading about how the Fleming's prime burger is very good not to mention a 3rd of the cost of the sliced filet burger.  I will probably try that next time.  My wife ordered the portebello mushroom burger and it was awesome.  It was topped with sauteed spinach and goat cheese.  OMG sooo good!  I should order that next time to put on top of a real burger.  It  was actually very good and I could see myself ordering that if I was not in the mood for red meat.  For dessert we all shared the lava cake.  WOW! Sooo good!  You have to order it 20 minutes in advance so you know it is fresh.  It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a bowl of fresh homemade whip cream.  The whole thing was just awesome but that whip cream put it over the edge.  The entire staff that waited on us during the evening were very fast and friendly.  All-in-all it was an excellent evening with great food and service.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has the wine cellar appearance with red chairs and mahogany wood everywhere.  There are even pictures of wine bottles hanging on the wall.  It gives off a classy and elegant feel without being too pretentious.    The bread that was given at the beginning was average.  Hard on the outside and soft on the inside.  It was the butter that was taken me by surprise.  There was a chiptole butter and also a sour cream butter.  The chiptole butter was the best.    I chose a Chilean sea bass with sautéed spinach.  It was a flakey and stringy texture as a great bass would have.  The bread crumbs on top added a nice crunchy texture for contrast.  It was a fresh fish which didn't have a fishy taste, but not as good of a taste as expected.  My friend had the filet mignon with crab on top and scallops on the side.  The scallops were the best.  Not too bouncy and cooked just right.  The crab has a mediocre taste.  Something common like it can be made at home.  The filet is tender deep red meat and not that flavorful because of the lack of fat.  And again, it was average.  The dessert was the best part of the meal.  The chocolate lava cake with REAL whipped cream.   The warm rich chocolate center with vanilla ice cream and pistachio on top added to the whole cake.    Overall the food was pretty good, but the value isn't.  For as much as it costs, I would be expecting something better."}
{"text":"Dang..Hate to write this.  Big plans...Make reservation specifically asking for quiet table. Guess what?  They sit us next to a group of 20..... Waiter and staff were very nice..professional. Takes our Drink order..spends the next half hour with the group of 20. Finally I get his attention and beg for another beer. I actually have to ask about getting an appetizer...Dang..  So far the anniversary is going south.... Next we decide to split a $65 Ribeye medium rare..... Comes out raw. Dang.... Could have went to Safeway for this steak. Server tells me be careful with the plate...Hot...and all that.  It was about as hot as a chilled salad plate at Applebees. Dang.. So much for sizzling butter.  Ah..man...Well the coffee was delicious....I will say that. Again, the waiter and staff were top notch. The food was no better than Sizzler..and that is after dropping $200.  Cant risk going back with that kind of damage...."}
{"text":"This is an update to a previous review. I was in Phoenix again for a week and came here for dinner one night. The dry aged strip steak was fabulous but the asparagus was overcooked, mushy and just horrible! It was so mushy that the knife couldn't even cut through it. How can you cook a steak just right but screw up something simple as asparagus? It also cost Eleven Dollars, so one would hope to get one's money's worth with a half dozen asparagus stalks. Five star steak dinner and a 0 star side dish on more than one occasion, equals 3 stars.   I'll be back for the steak, but never will I get their overpriced and overcooked asparagus!"}
{"text":"We had another fantastic meal!  This was at least our fourth visit here in the last year and it was exceptional.  Took out my in-laws, wife, & son for their Birthdays, which are all pretty close together.  Everyone of us was really happy with our meals.  The adults all had the 8oz. Filet Mignon & Lobster Tail special, which was great.  Everyone's steak was cooked to perfection, we all enjoyed our salads, the Fleming's Potatos, & each of us had a different dessert (delicious & filling).  Our waiter made an excellent suggestion on a Merlot that I wasn't to sure about.  He brought over a sample of it for me to try. I've now found another wine that I will seek to purchase.  This is the fourth wine that we love, that we had at Fleming's first.  Also, my son had a great steak with his kid's meal that he really enjoyed.  Thanks again, Fleming's for a most memorable evening!"}
{"text":"My family of 11 went with a reservation on a Monday night. There was some changes to our party size and the hostesses seemed so stressed about it. I would think that crisis this these would happens from time to time but they acted like the whole world was collapsing and they did not know what t do... get some extra chairs and get on with it! They were beyond annoyed by this time and we were kept waiting in the lobby for them to fix this code red catastrophe (insert eye roll).Ok so on to the actual meal. Our waitress was here and there and forgot more often than forgivable. Also when we were ordering our meal she asked us if we wanted soup or salad with our entrée, in my opinion implying that it was included with the order, but guess what? Not the case. This establishment tries to act like it is some high end steak house, but they only succeed in ACTING like it. My meal was cold and the steaks were a joke. The only good review that I would give would be for their clam chowder. As we were exiting the restaurant the hostesses gave us no more than a look in our direction leaving me feeling like a second class citizen... who spent more than $500 on a below average meal."}
{"text":"Not what you would expect for a $150+ meal for two. For an \"upscale\" steakhouse the food and service were nothing great. First, we never got the bread our server said would be right out when we arrived. We proceeded to ask for it two additional times before it was finally brought to us when we received our entree. The halibut was ok, but over cooked and the sauce on top was over bearing. The calamari was decent, but I have definitely had better. I also wish they put whatever sauce they had on it on the side so they breaded part stayed crispy. The only saving grace of the meal were the Fleming's potatoes. They were delicious. I doubt I would ever find myself back here, but if I did I would get the potatoes. Lastly, its not necessary to ask every time you refill water/ice tea, just fill it up and if I am not thirsty anymore I won't drink it and thus you won't refill it.   If you are looking for a delicious meal with great service this is not the place for you. My personal favorite in the valley is Mastro's City Hall - you will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places.  Very special anniversary treatment, fine prime rib and excellently designed seasonal specials.    The hot lava cake is my wife's favorite and I even enjoy it a little too. Service is exceptional and  I highly recommend it for anniversary's weddings or any occasion you can muster up to celebrate."}
{"text":"My wife and I were on vacation and came to Flemings for my birthday dinner. So for those of you who don't know, everything here is ordered separately unless otherwise. We arrived early and took a seat at the bar, lucky for us Brandon (bartender) was awesome. He went over some drink options, went over the happy hour menu and the dinner menu.  Then it was time to be seated, our waitress Krista was great, just like Brandon. She went over the menu, made some good recommendations and we were not disappointed, she definitely made you feel welcome. I suggest the mac and cheese (to die for), my wife had the prime rib (which according to her was sooooooooo good) and I had the seasonal fish which was cooked to perfection. So after all that goodness and if you have any room left, get the carrot cake and you will love every bite. Our experience was wonderful, from the moment you walk in, we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I stopped in for happy hour this past Friday. I'd previously been for their happy hour, and had a good experience and good food the first time. My first visit I tried the tenderloin carpaccio and the seared ahi tuna. Both were tasty, but I should have only ordered one; I was too full afterwards. I also had a nice glass of merlot that first visit. (I'd give the first visit 3 stars.) This latest visit was not as good; the service wasn't friendly. I sat @ the bar with a buddy, and we both ordered the prime burger. The burger was good, but regardless of how busy the bartenders were, they just weren't friendly (male or female). Shouldn't a place like this offer friendly, quality service? I'm a patient guy, and understand when a place is busy but that doesn't mean quality has to be lacking. I'll go back for the food, but am hoping the service gets better and friendlier."}
{"text":"I was there last weekend with my husband we didn't have reservations they told us there were heaters on the back patio which there was, unfortunately I still froze my butt off (not that it's their fault ) but it was uncomfortable throughout the meal . Also, no one noticed us after 10 minutes to ask if we wanted anything to drink... This is going to sound silly, but an appetizer said pork belly fried appetizer served with cranberry sauce, needless to say I didn't realize that was pure fat on a plate ( most places don't serve pure lard on a plate for a snack)  and I told the waiter that it was not to my liking and he seem to be disgusted by it. This place for the amount of money you pay, I am surprised by the crappy customer service and the food was nothing to brag about. I guess I'll have to make a trip back to Cali for some good food!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding!  Ask for Robert's section if you go, you will be treated very well.  The steaks however were not the best.  We were really craving a good steak so we were excited to try this place.  With so many other options in the DC Ranch/Scottsdale area, we probably will not go back. We ordered medium filets and we both got medium well. My husbands was closer to well done on the outsides.  It's too bad because we like the atmosphere and the service. I was told they are a high end Outback.  I wonder if they rotate chefs too."}
{"text":"Recently returned to Fleming's and had a better experience. I would still like to see better service and lower prices. My prime rib was excellent tho. Kudos to the chef!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just left! We had high hopes but the service was so poor! We were there for an hour, sat outside, which we actually liked but the waiter dropped our drinks and appetizers off and never returned! While we did tell him we were thinking of just drinks and appetizers, we would have considered dinner, had he upsold. But we never had a chance considering he never came back to ask if we wanted another wine or beer...very unwelcoming and we felt like we were a nuisance after a table of 6 were sat just beside us. My husband had to go to the hostess station to ask for a check. Considering the average prices for dinner at Flemings, I would expect better service. We have had beyond better service at local places as well as high priced. Texas Star in San Diego comes to my mind."}
{"text":"So- I always come here for happy hour. I actually haven't had regular dinner at this location- ever.  The happy hour menu is pretty cool- it's limited, but the stuff is tasty.  I have, however, had a problem with slow service here.  Frustratingly slow actually- which isn't expected for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"This place while incredibly expensive is delicious. There filet is great and the ribeye is even better. They cooked them to a perfect medium rare as well. The creamed spinach side is probably as good as the steaks themselves. The lobster one person had there was not that great which is my only complaint. The service though is unmatched, they are incredible."}
{"text":"Fianlly a happy hour that made me happy.  If you want some great food and drinks on a current economy budget the daily 5-7 happy hr may be a good choice for you.  $5 specialty drinks including a pomitini poured at the table. This drink was quite good and yes girly.  $5 appetizers including a great seared Ahi with a Jicama carrot salad. The Ahi has well spiced and of decent quality.  There are other $5 options as well.  $6 burger that looked huge and induced 2 onion rings and a challa roll for a bun.   There also is a $12 ahi burger that is more of a croquet style with 2 onion rings or a portobello burger too.  This happy hr is available at the bar era, or in the more relaxed patio. There are heaters on the patio for the cooler nights.  With thees prices we kept eating, and eating and yes eating. We left stuffed on great food.  I recommended a side of the saluted mushrooms of the menu as they really enhance any meal."}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday and was not impressed. The atmosphere was nice but my husband and I were not happy with the food at all. The bread they gave pre-meal was just ok but didn't seem very fresh. There were two types of butter that came along with the bread and both were actually pretty good. I ordered the lobster bisque to start and honestly, the flavor was a bit odd. I personally think the lobster bisque at Red Lobster is better not to mention cheaper. For dinner, I ordered the seared scallops that came on top of puff pastry and a measly portion of vegetables. The scallops were gritty and seemed like they had not been cleaned properly as I could taste granules of sand. My husband ordered the ribeye since Flemings is supposed to be known for their steak. He said that the steak was not seasoned at all. For sides, we ordered the Flemings potatoes which were really good and the baked potato which was fine, but honestly, how hard is it to mess up baked potato? When the check was presented they also gave me a box of chocolate truffles since it was my birthday. I wont lie, these were amazing!!! Unfortunately, the truffles, Flemings potatoes, and butter will not make me come back. I am all about giving places several tries before deciding to go back but not a place with a huge price tag such as Flemings. When I spend $100 on a dinner for two, I expect everything to be sensational and Flemings was very far from it.  PS: The husband said it was the worst steak ever and you would be better to light your money on fire rather then spending it here. :)"}
{"text":"I had received gift cards from my company as a gift on valentine's day ,unfortunately  my company keeps me so busy we just never had time to go ,so we had some free time and decided to check out the restaurant,  it was our first time there , service was great, we had the chefs choice filet mignon and lobster the wife had crab when food arrived the steak was awesome ,one of the best steaks I ever had , the lobster for me was super small and my wife felt the same about the crab ,but it was good I just felt portion size was small"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here for special occasions like birthdays or anniversary dinners and it is always a great experience. We recently went for our friends birthday and had another great experience! I love the complimentary valet parking, the staff is great, and the food is always so delicious. This last time we had the chocolate lava cake for the first time and that is what has me writing this review! It was simply amazing THE BEST lava cake I have ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"We had the chance to give this place another chance for dinner tonight. Food was really good. Steak was cooked to perfection. Our server was amazing. Appetizer was really good and the lava cake was just fabulous.  Just updating my previews review we were glad we gave this place a second chance.  Thank you Nick."}
{"text":"Excellent bday dinner started with signed bday card from the staff for my bday date - nice touch! Our waitress was wonderful - not too intrusive, but very helpful and even helped put on my girls bday necklace - nice! Dinner started with surprise seared scallop on cheese sauce which was delicious. Wedge salads with blue cheese, nuts, and crisp piece of bacon was fantastic. Then our entree of filet, lobster, asparagus, and Flemings potatoes. Steak cooked perfect - everything was amazing. Then bday desert with chocolate tart filled with gooey chocolate and 2 ice cream scoops, with fresh raspberry. Really, the entire meal and bday experience was perfect - both my bday date and myself were completely impressed. Thank you Flemings for a wonderful night."}
{"text":"My steak is cooked exactly how I want it every time. The service surpasses my own expectations. Yes this is not the greatest deal on a steak dinner but its worth it!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd try a different restaurant tonight so we decided on Fleming's in Chandler.  Enjoyed a nice dinner with my wife and friends. Fleming's is a great place for steaks.  I love a good NY Strip steak and the one I had tonight was well seasoned, flavorful, and cooked just as ordered, medium rare. My wife kept saying that her lobster tails were delicious. I should add that the French onion soup was very tasty, better than most. Oh, I don't want to forget to mention the delicious brussel sprouts. Seasoned with bacon... what's not to love? Service was adequate, but I thought our server could have been a little more attentive.  All in all, a great steakhouse."}
{"text":"Had an extremely delightful experience here while visiting Arizona in October. The service was great - waiter was not pushy, but there whenever needed. The food (especially my steak) was excellent, as was the wine. Can't wait to bring my husband here when we visit again."}
{"text":"Fun and elegant happy hour! Lite bites and also a glorious wine list! Service was quick and assistive. Patio was lit with heaters for warmth on a chilly night. I had the carpaccio and baked brie which were fab! Both were tasty and would definitely order again. Wine was served in proper glasses and so many to choose from. It is a pricey place but a superb place for an elegant happy hour"}
{"text":"Ok here it goes . 1-5 scale for Fleming's. Steak 5, 12 oz Filet mignon was cooked to order and tasty  Potatoes:4 very tasty, but expensive Cajun shrimp: 5  (Big shrimp cooked nicely) Service:5 friendly yet efficient   Conclusion: Steak alone will fill you here, sides are delicious but extravagantly priced.  Service is A+. Great if you are rich or for special occasions."}
{"text":"I really can't find any reason to not give Fleming's 5 stars.  Is it absolutely the best meal I have ever had, no, but pretty darn good.  We have been going to Fleming's for years and will continue to do so.  Yes, it is expensive for a typical night out so it's not a go-to that often for us but we still really enjoy the little splurge every now and again.  Fleming's is a great date night or special occasion place with friends.  I typically get the petite filet with the 3oz add-on shelled lobster tail.  The filet is always cooked to perfection and extremely tasty.  The lobster looks small when it is served but is always the right amount for me.  We almost always get a few sides and last night was no different.  We had our standard creamed spinach (my fav), Fleming's potatoes and creamed corn (I wasn't a huge fan of the creamed corn as it was a little spicy and that's not my thing).  The service is always excellent.  Almost forgot to mention that I love the Farmer's Daughter Martini...Delicious!  But beware, they go down quickly!  It's always a nice night out at Fleming's.  Just writing this review is making me hungry!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant and attractive place with great food.  My wife and I have been here 4 or 5 times in the past couple of years and have always received great food and courteous service.  I can vouch for the quality and taste of their meat, fish and sides.  You get wonderful dishes, large portions, cooked perfectly, according to your instructions.  Not only do they make their meat and fish dishes to excel, but you can't improve on .the flavor or consistency of any of their side dishes, making the veggies sing and dance in your mouth and their desserts take a curtain call!  Add reasonable prices to it all and you will have a wonderful and memorable repast at Fleming's.  You can't miss and they won't either."}
{"text":"This is sort of a tough review.  Flemings puts themselves out as high-end, and they charge high-end prices.  So one expects more from them than, for example, a Black Angus.  Normally I wouldn't go to a high-end steak house.  Frankly between my wife and I, we can do as well or better at home.  She does a couple of different seasonings depending on her mood, and I am pretty good at grilling them.  Anyway...we were invited to a seminar and the deal was they would feed us here.  Flemings does have some menu options you won't see at Black Angus, which is fine.  On this occasion I had the filet medallions (I think that's what they called them) with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Really nothing that fancy, but done properly this would be really good.  First point...I ordered medium well.  We agreed (the waiter and I) that this meant there would be a little pink, but not much.  Just a bit.  So when it come out it's medium rare.  VERY pink.  Not even medium.  Gotta mark them down for that.  Lots of places do that, and it's annoying.  I've given up asking anyone to cook it more because it always comes back either dry or burned.  Not Flemings specifically, but any steak place.  It's like they're annoyed...\"you want it done more, I'll show you 'done more', you cretin!!\".  Instead I just live with it.  Flavor-wise the filet was good.  Basic seasoning, nothing fancy.  But \"nothing fancy\" works in this case.  Nice flavor.  The potatoes were a bit cheesy, not much garlic.  They were fine.    Nothing special.  I think a bit more garlic was in order as I couldn't really detect any. The green beans I thought were a little under-cooked but I know a lot of people like that crisp snap.  The seasoning of the beans was good.  More than just a little salt, they really jazzed them up.  I liked them.  So the verdict?  Well, given how they bill themselves and what you pay I simply expect more.  I expect exciting flavors (even with potatoes), and I expect them to know what \"medium-well\" means and how to achieve it.  The meal was fine.  Even good.  But was it truly \"high-end\"?  I don't think so.  I've had high-end a few times, and this wasn't it.  So they're \"OK\", but I can't go so far as to say I'm a fan.  Three stars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to a great night to celebrate and have a great night.   We were disappointed and the experience ruined what was supposed to be a great Saturday night.  We had reservations and were seated immediately in a great booth. Our waiter was friendly and we got off to a great start. Two cocktails, French onion soup and a shrimp cocktail to start. So far so good. Then we ordered a wedge salad, a steak each, two sides and two glasses of wine. I would not recommend using the electronic device to pick out wines as it was super confusing and looking at the wines on the printed menu was definitely easier. He ordered his steak medium and I ordered mine medium rare. When they arrived, the tip of his was medium but the rest was rare at best. Mine was underdone as well although not as much. There was literally a pool of blood on his plate by the time we finally got the waiter back to our table after flagging another waiter to get him. We were embarrassed (because how are you supposed to have to do that at a place like this) but sent it back. A manager stopped by and said he understood it was under cooked and we explained the situation. He listened but it felt a little patronizing. What came back looked like a hockey puck. At that point, we just told them they could take it away. We were so embarrassed that we just asked for the check and wanted to leave. Our night was ruined. And we somehow felt like it was our fault. They removed that steak from our check and a round of cocktails but our check was still $200. I received an email survey that I completed after the experience and still have heard nothing. The steaks were the only problem with our meal but we were at a STEAK HOUSE. How is that what they screw up?!??!?!?! And why did we feel like it was our fault the meal wasn't as we ordered it? We've had MUCH better meals at The Keg and plan to keep it that way. A HUGE disappointment and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place on business trip. Ordered salad and ribeye steak. The steak was good but not great same for the salad. Ruth's Chris is way better than this place. They have the best steak and I will recommend it instead of this place."}
{"text":"This is a strange review to write, because I'm a fan of Fleming's. I expect to write a 5 star review every time... but today, this is a 3 Star review that was bumped to 4 for good reason. I came in with a party of 8 coworkers, celebrating the end of the year. Our party included a mixture of people, some who eat at higher end restaurants on occasion, and some who were experiencing $50 steaks for the first time. Those of us with a little more experience, hyped up Fleming's and set expectations high. After all, it doesn't get a whole heck of a lot better. Right? We took advantage and ordered a lot of food. For starters we had the crab cakes, the calamari and the cold seafood tower. The calamari was fantastic! Great flavor, and this coming from someone who normally doesn't like calamari. Crab cake was good, though not amazing, and everything in the seafood tower was solid.  We had a couple of bottles of  a great Cab, Stag's Leap Artemis- which was wonderful ($135 a bottle). A few salads were ordered, all looked good and plates were cleaned. We shared a number of sides; Fleming's potatoes, mashed potatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, Brussel sprouts, and the Mac-n-cheese. All the sides were good, no complaints at all. Fleming's potatoes and the Brussels sprouts (believe it or not) seemed to get the best reviews. The disappointment tonight, shockingly, was the steaks. 7 of 8 ordered steaks. 5 of the 7 were cooked at the wrong temperature, 4 under cooked and one over cooked.  I'm not a complainer and I'm pretty good at eating a steak anywhere around medium, but my steak was medium-rare and closer to rare than medium-rare. As I cut around the edges of my $60 steak, I noticed others doing the same. After taking a pole, I learned that nearly everyone had an issue with their temperature. Problem was, by the time a waiter came by to see how everything was, the meal was half over. He asked how everything was, and I showed him my steak. I asked, \"what temperature is this?\", he said \"mid-rare\", that's right! But I ordered medium, and so did he, and so did she, and him over there...all the medium temps were cooked mid/rare to rare and one was cooked closer to med/well. Not one was cooked perfectly. Very surprised. I've never had temperatures so far off, for so many, in a single meal at any restaurant.  The issue of course is sending your steak back when the meal is half over. By the time you get it returned, everyone is finished and you're eating alone! No thanks, I'm not going to send it back- but I'm not happy. I expect wrong temperatures from Outback or Texas Roadhouse, but not Fleming's. And certainly not 5 of 7 steaks. If that was the end, I'd call this a 3 Star review. However....  The manager came by and said he heard there was a problem with some of the temperatures, I showed him what was left of my steak, explained that 5 of the 7 were wrong and why it was too late in the meal to send them back. He apologized, and without batting and eye, said they expect better and so should we...and took all 5 steaks off our bill. That's about $300, just like that.   I wasn't asking for free food and truth be told, my undercooked steak was still really tasty, just not the way I ordered it. The manager could have stopped at offering to cook our steaks more, or bringing a new one, but understood that it was too late. He went above and beyond my expectations by removing them from our bill. And that's why I had to add a star.   Will I be back? Yes I will. I've had a number of 5 star experiences at Fleming's...and now that I know there's basically a money back guarantee, I've got nothing to lose! A+ on the customer service."}
{"text":"Brandon is AWESOME!! He is a great bartender who knows how to balance the servers, the bar guest, and be inviting all at the same time. Best of all:he is truthful!!! Who doesn't hate those bartenders/servers that sell you on terrible products just because they are more expensive?   Now let's talk about the food. Always cooked to order and promptly served. You never get the feeling that YOU, the guest, are bothering the staff. Maybe that is just at the bar, but hopefully it extends to the whole restaurant!!! They have a fantastic happy hour from 5-7, then have ANOTHER one from 8-10!!!! The second is a little more expensive but sooo worth it!!! I will continue to dine and suggest other do the same."}
{"text":"This is a high-end steakhouse and you pay for it. I never spend my own money here... too expensive - but I never pass up a chance to eat here on someone else's dime!  All the food is excellent... the one time my steak was bad they took it back no questions asked, gave me another and comp'd the entree.  The seafood tower, if you can afford it, is fantastic. The wine selection, as you'd expect, is very good.  Not much else to say as since if you know what a high-end steakhouse is supposed to be, this is it."}
{"text":"Flemings has predictably great service, good atmosphere, good food and an expensive bill. Great for a special ocasion. The steaks are not quite on par with some of the other top tier steakhouses in Phoenix. But, it's still one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Ate Dinner here when I was visiting a friend in Arizona. The food was superb. The locatiion was nice and the ambiance was beautiful. Had a pork chop and crab cakes and that food was delcious. Also tried the Fleming Potatoes and was so stuffed I couldn't finish it but they were delicious as well. I highly recommend this place. Prices are expensive though so don't forget your wallet. LOL"}
{"text":"It's Flemming's, need I say more. Brought some customers here for a post meeting dinner and Brian, our waiter, was fabulous.  Kept all orders perfectly matched and was always attentive. Multiple New York Strips were cooked to perfection. I ordered mine smothered in blue cheese. Wow! So perfectly medium rare and the cheese and juices still make my mouth water.  In my opinion, the best chain chop house in the country."}
{"text":"Oh how I love restaurant week!  1st stop was Fleming's -- I totally dig the Fleming salad, then again I'm a big fan of cranberries in general.  Their filet I thought was nicely done, when I want medium I want it medium!  As for dessert -- nothing to rave about since it kind of fell flat for me.  Not a huge fan of chocolate over chocolate with some chocolate.... know what I mean?  Service was real good they were attentive and quick.  Ambience was nothing too surprising except I wish I had wore my blazer with a cigar sticking out of my mouth while walking around with a Wallstreet Journal clip under my arm.  Hand me my walking stick Remington!  Overall, it was a good experience and the food was good.  I though I can't recommend becoming a regular especially with today's food price. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My fiancé took me here for a mother's day present, and it was great! Service was awesome, and the manager Nick came over to check on us. After dinner we sat at the bar for a bit, the bartenders there are awesome!  Side note: get the Fleming's potatoes. Sometimes I dream about their deliciousness."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our anniversary. We both got filets and they were incredible, perfect temperature and VERY flavorful. The service was phenomenal as well. A true 5-star restaurant."}
{"text":"We visited Flemings for the steak and lobster special. Our meals were cooked perfectly and the portions were just right. Our server, Byron M. was excellent. He made sure our visit was great. He was very attentive."}
{"text":"We had a party of four reservation at 7:15 and we got in pretty much exactly at that time. Service was fast and friendly. The bread and butter was amazing and the steak was even better.. I got the NY strip for 41 bucks and it was huge and worth every juicey penny."}
{"text":"We have dined at this Flemings location numerous times before and had wonderful experiences, however, this time things fell very flat.  Things started off fine with water and a wine list that was provided via Ipad.  My fiance's mother asked the waitress for wine recommendations and she wasn't able to help ( it seemed like she wasn't too familiar with the selection).  Ordering food was fairly quick and easy.  Once we received our steaks, the waitress informed us about the lava cake that takes 20 minutes to cook, and told us she would check back in shortly to see if we were interested.  We didn't see her again for at least 30 minutes.   I know, I know.  When people usually say 30 minutes they are grossly overestimating out of frustration; however, we actually did wait that long.  So long in fact, it began to get awkward at the table.  All the food was consumed and our wine glasses were empty, yet our waitress was nowhere in sight.  When she did finally show, it was too late to order the lava cake.  We instead ordered two plates of creme brulee and two desserts to go, along with a cup of coffee.  The coffee was cold, and it took 10 minutes to get a new hot cup.  Once dessert was finished we again were left waiting around for our waitress; waiting to clear dishes, waiting to receive the check, and again, waiting to pay the check.  In all it took us two hours to have a simple meal, and that was not by choice.    The food was great, per usual, but the service was just downright bad."}
{"text":"Service was great!   Nick was a fantastic waiter!   The food.....meh....The Keg is definitely better. We gave this place a shot after hearing great things about it.   I can't put my finger on it, there was just nothing special about it, especially for its higher price range. The Filet was just ok, and a little chewy. The truffle mashed potatoes were good.   My wife got the french toast brunch special, and it was not good at all. She did not eat but one bite. She said it reminded her of bread pudding.   Needless to say, we will keep going to The Keg for our steak house dinners."}
{"text":"The steak was good, but not particularly impressive at $40 per plate. I got the Surf and Turf special with scallops, and two 5oz filet. The filets were good, cooked perfectly, and great cuts of meat. Just not wowed. The real disappointment was in the scallops that came with the dish. For the class of the place, one expects a certain level, and those scallops didn't even come close."}
{"text":"Had a LobsterFeast here.... and was not.. NOT, disappointed.  We order the \"LOBSTER TOWER\" as our appy... soooo GOOOD!  The lobster-cobb salad was a trough of yumminess!!!... I didn't even hit the bottom of the salad bowl... it was soooooo gooooood....  Dessert was devilishly delicious...  Gettin serviced by Anthony was seamless and nice....   Would I go again?  HECK YES!!"}
{"text":"Here again. Steak BURNED. Sent it back. Came back really burned. We were with a party of 16. So I just sent it back and told him I didn't want a steak anymore. No manager came and apologized.   Come one Flemings."}
{"text":"Went here for New Year's eve, Gary was our fabulous server -very attentive and shared lots of great information about the food. Our main course of fillet mignon and truffle mash potatoes were on point, perfect! Also had their signature chocolate lava cake, a little fancy for my blood but my husband ate every last bite. they also have a great happy hour, worth the money to splurge on a great meal. Also, their bread and multiple butters to dip in were delicious!"}
{"text":"Fleming's has never been my favorite place to eat dinner, but I do love to go for their Five Six Seven menu in the lounge or on the patio. Though the prices have gone up over the years, it is still a decent deal for what it is. We started with the Blueberry Lemon Drop Martinis which were refreshing and tart with just a little sweetness. The calamari was good, but too much sauce made it soggier than preferred. We also tried the crab cakes, which to my surprise were some of the best I've had! The prime burger is always good, though the brioche bun and pepper bacon are what really shine through, and always get their onion rings (way better than their fries). Lastly my sister got the flatbread on the 567 menu. I didn't try it, but she said it was delicious. Only downfall besides the increased prices would be that the lighting is so dim in the bar are you can barely see the people sitting in front of you. Will be back for sure, but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Dinner at Fleming's was fantastic! The service was professional and attentive. Food was delish; my barbecued salmon fillet flaked perfectly, and the bed of sautéed mushrooms underneath were the perfect complement. Lighting is low and intimate, so it's great for personalized occasions."}
{"text":"Although the steak was terrific, the service was slow and the food was cold when it did come.  When making my reservations, I had asked for the warmest spot in the house but we were seated in a cold and drafty area.  Very disappointing because we brought my mother for a very special occasion and we were all sorry we had come"}
{"text":"My boyfriend has taken me to this place twice and I absolutely love it.  The service is always top notch.  We have had the same waiter both times and it was nice he remembered us.  The appetizers and the main dish are always on point.  I always get the filet mignon and I love it.  We love going here and will continue to go."}
{"text":"I don't normally like to write negative reviews, and I certainly did not expect to write one about this steak chain based on its reputation, but our first experience here will be our last.  We chose to eat at Fleming's because we wanted a nice dinner before a show we were seeing at the AMC Cinema across the highway.  Our reservation was early, 5PM, just at opening.  Perhaps this was the mistake we made, or perhaps our experience was typical.  Entering the restaurant I was instantly blinded by how dark it was.  It was as if they had forgotten to turn on the lights.  Being led to our small, cramped, too narrow booth, I bumped into other booth edges and tripped over chairs because I could not see them.  After squeezing into the seat I was handed the wine list which I also could not read.  It took a good 10 minutes for my eyes to adjust to the cave-like lighting.  Not impressed.  Also not impressive was the waiter, who maybe was having a bad day or maybe he had just arrived and was not yet in \"waiter mode\" or maybe he was just a jerk, but he was not attentive nor seemingly interested in serving us.  He did not have a suggestion for wine even after I informed him I was ordering a bottle, which is not in character for a \"Wine\" restaurant.  If he worked for me he'd have been out on his ear.  The wine list was good, although short on our favorite varietals.  We found the one red Zinfandel on the list to try.  And then we waited.  A bus boy brought us water, but no bread.  Other tables seemed to have bread.  We waited some more.  And some more.  Does it take 30 minutes to get a bottle of wine?  I started checking my watch, knowing we only had 2 hours until the show.  Eventually the waiter returned with the wine.  I tried to joke with him that maybe the bottle was just a hard one to find and he grunted something unintelligible, showed me the label for 5 seconds and popped the cork, then asked if we were ready to order.  We ordered salads and steaks and he said \"thanks\" and left.  OK, I will pour my own glass.  The salads were the highlight of the meal.  My wife had a wedge and I had their special salad, and we both enjoyed them.  This was the only part of the meal we enjoyed.  When the steaks arrived we had to ask for bread to accompany the meat, which eventually arrived.  The steaks looked to be done to our Med-Rare order but both my wife's filet and my aged NY Strip were raw at one end.  It was almost as if they had been half-off the grill.  We could not eat them, and had no time to send them back.  We ate what we could and had the rest boxed to nuke at home.  My wife ordered a side of mushrooms and I the asparagus, and while the asparagus was done it was flavorless and my wife's mushrooms so full of garlic that was all they tasted of.  We finished our wine, paid the nearly $300 check and left.  We will not be back.  Also, we cannot assert that there were hormones in the beef, but my wife is sensitive to this and after eating here she was sick for some time.  Ugh.  We cannot assert that the beef was tainted... however..."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Service was good but considering my fiancé and I apparently don't look the part we felt constantly hounded, \"checked up on\" and rushed out from our dinner. It felt a little awkward and unfortunate. I have to say I'm pretty disappointed in the reaction of a young tattooed couple trying to enjoy a nice evening together and wished we were not to feel so judged as if we were going to \"dine and ditch\" little alone my wine ended up needing to get replaced from a fly getting into it."}
{"text":"Took my wife for her birthday and we loved every minute of this place! Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"I MUST write an update from my last review.  After my recent \"poor\" review on Yelp, I received an email and phone call, from John Jeffrey, Operations Manager.  John went over the issues I mentioned and invited me back to their location.  I must admit, I was very hesitant. I don't write reviews to receive anything for free, I only write reviews only to warn future customers.  I told John I was unsure if I would be back, but he encouraged me to come back in and allow them another opportunity.  My husband and I decided to go tonight and it was FABULOUS!  Every expectation I had was met this this time!  I would highly recommend Flemings, in Chandler, to anyone I know.   Thank you again John, for taking the time to reach out to me, and to invite us back.  We will be back to your location in the future!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent staff and classy yet relaxed ambiance. Location was also perfect for a nearby date night with the hubby."}
{"text":"I had never been here before and was SUPER excited to eat here for Thanksgiving dinner I heard great things about the restaurant, so needless to say I was very disappointed in the food. I got the steak and lobster and it wasn't good at all no flavor it was just so blah nothing special about it and for the price you pay the food should be out of this world and it's just not and not worth going and spending all that money just to be let down I hate to say this but I would've rather gone to the Outback and had their steak and lobster at least I know I would've enjoyed my dinner. I won't be back nor will I refer people to the restaurant don't waste your money people."}
{"text":"Very interesting.  We've been to this Fleming's on several occasions, and tonight seemed to be a continuation of the progression downhill for this restaurant, in my opinion.  We decided to make this a family of four dinner, bringing our 10 and 12 year olds.  Obviously, we tried to stick with steak at this steak house.  We came at opening, about 5pm, arriving at 4:50.  They did have us wait until they were ready at 5pm, and that's okay.  The opening, though, plays a big part later in this review.  We stuck with water, as you can run up a really high bill very quickly.  Our orders were taken late (about 15 minute wait)  because we had not ordered drinks, and the waiters were busy brining out wine, etc, to the other tables.  The bread was fresh, but the butter was not.  It was dried out, like it had been frozen, and we were served the freezer burnt butter.  I asked for the Crab Cake appetizer to be brought out at the same time as everyone else's plate.  This was screwed up, and was brought out early.  So everyone else had to watch me eat.  I was having this as a \"small plate\" dish.  The boys had the specials, which were a petite filet mignon along with 3 scallops.  We asked for medium--they were undercooked, more along the lines of rare to medium-rare.  The scallops were well cooked, but a little bland.  The 10 year old did not like them, and he usually really enjoys seafood.  I added on the Chipotle Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese for the kids, which they liked, along with Half and Half, which is shoestring fries with Onion Rings, both tasted okay.  My wife had the Double Thick Pork Rib Chop.  The sauce was very tasty, BUT the pork was underdone, and was visibly raw in the middle.  This was unacceptable.  We had to send the plate back, which was put under the broiler, and then brought back to us.  I have to say this is the second time in a row that my wife's meat was raw at this Fleming's.  I would've chalked it up to oven not being hot enough for the first dishes, but this seems to be a recurrent problem.    I had a small plate, the Sliced Filet Mignon, which is served on Risotto.  The meat was very well done, but the risotto was completely dried out and tasteless. I was very disappointed.  As it took about another 10-15 minutes between when our plates were taken away and our waiter came with the dessert menu, we had decided to skip dessert and coffee and make our way to Starbucks, about two buildings away.  I'm willing to forgive the delays due to them just opening up.  Plus, it was Veteran's Day.  However, the food being underprepared for the second time in a row is unforgivable, especially for as expensive a restaurant as Fleming's is.  This is really starting to feel like a \"chain\" restaurant as it really is rather than an exclusive steak restaurant, which they strive to be.  Overall, I think we're done with Fleming's."}
{"text":"After my last review Fleming's manager, Miguel, gave me a phone call expressing his apologies for our less than stellar experience and invited me to come back.  I was a bit shocked by the phone call but also very grateful.  Fleming's obviously takes their customer satisfaction very seriously and it made mew feel good knowing that time was taken to care about how I was feeling.   Words cannot express how amazing our revisit was.  Linda's service was impeccable and I would highly recommend asking for her section next time you go.   I ordered the Mozzarella and Tomato salad, what a vision of loveliness it was (see pics) and it tasted just heavenly, the mozzarella melted in my mouth and the tomato's were so sweet and juicy along with that spicy basil I would have been happy just stopping there.   For my entree I decided to try the Barbecue Scottish salmon Fillet.........WOW!!  Absolutely incredible! This is bar far the best item I've ordered here and is now my new favorite. (see pics) It's sweet and slightly crisp BBQ glaze had me yearning for more.   Now I haven't ordered mashed potatoes from Flemings in years since they took their horseradish mashed potatoes off the menu, but let me tell you after trying their Parmesan peppercorn mashed potatoes I soon forgot my long lost favorite, these ones were to die for!!!  Perfectly creamy, thick , buttery and seasoned to perfection I will be ordering these from now on most definitely!   My husband's usual order of chipotle mac and cheese and a medium rare fillet was no exception to the excellence, he reveled in every bite!   What a total surprise it was when Linda brought him a Creme' Brulee with a candle to re-celebrate his Birthday!  That my dear friends is attention to detail and absolutely made us feel very special and quite frankly made our night!   Our entire evening was flawless from first bite to last.  I can't Thank Miguel and Linda enough for taking such good care of us and we will without a doubt continue dining with you.  You won back my heart and I must say you deserve 5++++++ stars!!"}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my husband's promotion. Our steaks were delicious and cooked to our preferred perfection.  I added the lobster with caviar and it was unbelievably tender and melted in my mouth.  We had the lava cake for dessert and nearly died and went to heaven it was so delicious! Pricing is high but we'll worth it!"}
{"text":"I thought I had previously offered a review of Flemings, but I guess I didn't.  So here goes....  Long story short - GREAT STEAKHOUSE in Chandler, AZ!  I received a gift card at Christmas while visiting my partner's family in Phoenix.  We decided to check out the restaurant considering we don't have a Flemings in Portland, OR.  The place is part of the Open Table reservation system which worked perfectly.  I made a reservation via Open Table and collected 1000 points for doing so.  Even better!  We arrived a few minutes early and were greeted by a kind hostess who immediately attended to our reservation.  The place was a bit swanky, but not too intimidating.  The lighting in the restaurant was perfect.  It had a lively ambiance and the patrons were middle-age to older and a bit more upscale than say, Outback Steakhouse.  We were seated and assigned a very knowledgeable waiter who introduced himself as well as the menus and wine selections.  We were offered a choice of either white or black linens which took me by surprise.  Of course I chose black from the standard white as I knew that would hide any unseemly messes.  The food arrived well-presented and almost reverently.  Our plates looked AMAZING!  I ordered a filet mignon which was grilled to perfection.  The medallion melted in my mouth!  The garlic mashed was equally delicious and the asparagus was cooked al dente.  We savored each bite and anxiously looked forward to dessert.  We ordered creme brûlée and raspberry chocolate lava cake.  One word:  HEAVENLY!  The dessert was a perfect ending to an already amazing meal.  Needless to say, we left Flemings more than satisfied.  The service, food, atmosphere and cost led to a very harmonious experience for all of us.  We will definitely put Flemings on the agenda of places to dine when we're back in Arizona in a few weeks.  Heck, we'll visit on EVERY visit to AZ!   Thank you Flemings for the outstanding hospitality and excellent service experience!"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate our anniversary and were not disappointed. Our waiter was great. We shared the spinach salad and chipotle mac & cheese. Both were very good. My husband LOVED his ribeye. I had the filet topped with a crab cake and béarnaise sauce. It was perfection. So good. Neither of us were able to finish our meals because we wanted to leave space for desert. We shared the crime brûlée. It was amazing. We topped it with the Chantilly cream, which you can just eat alone with a spoon. It was the perfect cap to the night. Because of the occasion, they also sent us home with truffles and a $25 gift card for our next visit. Great evening."}
{"text":"We have eaten at some of the best steak places in both the US and Canada and were pleasantly surprised at Flemings. For starters the Seafood Tower is a meal and amazing, my wife had the Wedge Salad with a slab of bacon, which I had to tryI had the Clam Chowder, outstanding ! We split a 12 ounce filet with the coffee rub, perfectly cooked and delicious. The Fleming potatoes were good, expected more of a kick with jalapeños but still good. Finished the meal with coffee and a Sambuca on the rocks! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was an awesome meal for me. I ordered the main filet and it was fantastic. Cooked perfectly to order and tasted amazing. The lack of the fifth star was for price and one minor shortcoming in service.   Price: dinner for two with gratuity came out to $200! That is pretty high even considering the quality.   Service: between our order and the arrival of our dinner there was some down time. This would have been a great opportunity to offer us a second round of bread. I watched other tables have the same experience. I think this must be a policy. Might be a policy to review."}
{"text":"Wanted a top notch meal and that's what we got.  The pork belly appetizer was cooked perfectly and also had a polenta/cherry sauce that worked well.  Wedge salad was a pleasure - big slices of blue cheese on fresh bacon.  Wonderful.  All entrees were prepared perfectly - dry aged ribeye, filet, salmon - excellent.  Mac and cheese and au gratin potatoes were just as decadent as we'd expect.  The onions were a bit grainy but not bad.  For desert we got a molten lava cake - oozy as expected plus a perfectly crisp vanilla cookie and ice cream.  Wow.  A grass hopper for a night cap and I'm already planning my next trip.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"First time here, for 11 year wedding anniversary.  Caesar salad was good. Had to wait too long for our entree. I had a ribeye cooked med. rare and was cooked perfect. My wife had a filet mignon cooked medium but it came out med. well. She did not want to wait for a new one so she ate it. We told our waiter about it and he comped our dessert. Had the molten lava cake for dessert, it was awesome."}
{"text":"Delish!  Do I need to say more?  For a nice mean try Flemings.  Great happy hour too."}
{"text":"Overall visit was great with no real complaints. I ordered lobster tail which was served with warm butter in a dish above a candle to keep it warm. Which I loved because it made the lobster taste even more delicious. The lava cake is definitely worth it. The peach mule was not peachy at all in fact it was very limey and tasted more like a margarita. Perhaps it was made wrong but I didn't taste the peach whatsoever and for a 18 dollar cocktail I would hope for something that tastes like the description. Also, ambiance was fine but you are very close to everyone else as far as seating and it is VERY dark so seeing your food is actually really difficult. Other than that the food is great and I'll definitely come back. Good for date nights and celebratory dinners for sure but not the best place for young children. You will also spend a lot here so made sure you plan on it. For the 2 of us it was over 200 with 1 cocktail, 2 entrees, 1 side, and 2 desserts."}
{"text":"It was my Birthday and my wife, her mom, a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler, AZ. We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately.   The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.  Next time, we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more. Durant's, downtown Phoenix and worth the drive."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG, the happy hour hamburger is so delicious (I think it's the bacon that does it).   I've only been here twice, and both times for happy hour. They have an excellent happy hour for the quality of food they serve. I've tried, obviously the burger and also the crab cakes, both which were yummy. The drink specials are great too, they make a great margarita and have an ample wine list. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Consistently incredible service and flawless steaks award Fleming's Steakhouse five big ones. I've been to steakhouses all over the country and this place holds it's own with the best of them while not being overbearingly expensive. It's not cheap by any means, and it's got a dash more of the old school cool flare than the modern feel to it, but I don't consider that a particular fault. Few places at this point in time get me as fired up as knowing I'm going to Fleming's for a bone-in rib-eye... that thing is a masterpiece."}
{"text":"Staff was very accommodating, service was good. Drinks are overpriced.   I ordered the filet with Gorgonzola, it was cooked properly, tender, and appropriate size. We ordered the Diablo Shrimp as an accompaniment, they were too small and overpriced. The flavor was delicious however.   Scalloped potatoes were not good and would never order again.   I would recommend Del Frisco's or Maeastros any day before Flemings."}
{"text":"Flemings Flemings Flemings ...   Well, upon arrival, I was shocked at how loud it was on the dining room floor. There are other seating areas, but the main dining is in one particular area. I will say apart from the noise, I enjoyed the lighting and the atmosphere in general; lots of people smiling and enjoying food.   I ordered the Chilean sea bass & ended up sending it back. Here's why: the 'broth' that it comes in is a bit much for me. My fish was swimming in a broth that made the crunchy bits of potato soggy & took away from the overall enjoyment of the fish. The fish itself was cooked perfectly, but it lacked flavor. The chile pesto that was used to dress the plate was FABULOUS ! I'm wondering why they don't ditch the broth and focus on how the fish and the sauce pair together effortlessly..   The second meal I ordered was the filet mignon & lobster tail. The steal was OK. It was dry and over cooked but instead of ordering AGAIN I decided to give it a try... Eh. I should've sent it back! The lobster was the highlight def. it was tender and cooked perfectly.   Suffice it to say, I'd give them another chance and try some other options on their menu. Although, for a steak house to send out a dry over cooked steak requested medium, that's a pretty tough blow.! I think there's a fine line between being a restaurant that can handle volume & being one that produces decadence with every plate served."}
{"text":"If u make a reservation plan to wait 15-30 minutes longer. We made a 7:45pm reservation & were not seated until 8:15. If you like a good steak it might be worth the wait. Just don't plan on a movie after."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going here. The crab cakes are delicious, as is the cheesecake! The servers, especially in the bar, are always so friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris quality without the commute ... or the snoot."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for our anniversary. They asked us what was the special occasion because we were dressed up, and we told them it was our anniversary. They congratulated us and asked how long etc. The service was excellent, I never had an empty glass and the food was amazing. I got the pork chops and my girlfriend got the chicken. By far one of the best restaurants. One of the managers asked us what was the special occasion and then asked if we'd like a gift! They gave us a card and a box of chocolates and a card. Overall, it was a nice restaurant. They can at least have real candles for this type of restaurant ;)"}
{"text":"The happy hour is great - $6 apps/drinks but the bar area is tiny and can't hold more than 15-20 people.  As a result it fills up right away.  Get there early if going for happy hour.  For the dining room the food is great.  The steaks and prime rib are great.  The prime rib special on Sundays is an especially good deal.  You get a salad, prime rib, a side, and a dessert for $39.95."}
{"text":"The last few visits to Flemings have been a disappointment.  Not sure why so much has changed there - but it has. The steak was a bit overcooked, did not want to complain and put a damper on the celebration at hand - it was acceptable, it also had obvious fork holes poked into it.  The side salad is small, we used to be able to split it, not anymore. The appetizer they serve as a complimentary appetizer was dull - cracked bread with 3 dips that aren't very flavorful. It was noisy, hard to visit. We sat on the main floor at a 4 top table. The Service was confusing, had one person take our order & then it seemed another Server took over, we hardly saw the person who took our order at our table, but saw her at others surrounding ours  - food was delivered by someone else, which is typical in many restaurants - that was acceptable. There was a birthday celebration and the birthday person was handed a little box with candies, which is nice - but not special, in the past, they would serve the birthday person creme brulee -- When we want a special night out again, it won't be at Flemings. Prices do not justify the atmosphere, food or service."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a very nice meal. We both had the lobster/filet combo with Fleming's potatoes. The steaks were prepared to perfection and the potatoes were scrumptious. The lobster was however a bit salty but that didn't take away from a great meal. We both started out with salads and for desert I had the hot lava cake and she had creme brulee.  The service was excellent which added to a great evening."}
{"text":"The steak was okay. A little gritty and not as tender as I'd hope. The Flemings Potatos were terrible! They wern't cooked all the way. Our drinks sat empty quite often. They forgot the butter for our king crab legs and we had to remind them a few times to bring it. For dinner at $150 I would expect better. We wished that we had gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here from out of state with my best friend for our birthday. Everything was wonderful. Made a reservation online. Once we arrived we were seated immediately. My filet mignon was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and my best friend was very happy with her seared ahi. Sides are for the table and we chose the mac and cheese & brussel sprouts. They were amazing. We finished off with the creme brûlée and the chocolate lava cake. The manager came by to check on us (unsolicited)... he offered us a sample of dessert wine along with our desserts. Overall everything was amazing. Our server Byron. He was great."}
{"text":"Great dinner and great service. They do have an awesome happy hour from 5-7, but it's extremely tough getting a spot at the bar area.   Some of the most flavorful and best food! They have Fleming's potatoes and they're so delicious, I'd highly recommend.  Big selection of wine and cocktails."}
{"text":"1st and foremost I will say that the environment is very nice here.   You will get out formal dining areas with high ceilings that requires you to look presentable. This is the ultimate date location when you want to look your best for your husband or wife.  I think everyone knows that you should expect a bill of over $100 here. It's nice to splurge every once in while on a nice bottle of wine or at least an expensive glass or 2.  However, if you are in the 50 to $60 per plate per person range, you don't really get much. I ordered The rib eye and my wife ordered the fillet with a side of brussel sprout.   The sprouts were amazing let me just say that.  The steaks were a little underwhelming.   All we got for the stakes was a plain piece of meat on a white plate. No garnishes, no sauces offered, just meat on plate.   Each was very tasty karma but in a societee where we eat with our eyes, I was a little disappointed.  Perhaps next time we will up our budget to $100 per person and get something we are not disappointed in"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to eat dinner early so Flemings happy hour is perfect for us. Our favorite was the pork belly, happy hour price was around 7$. Tonight we decided to drop in there again. We were told they didn't have the pork belly but it was replaced with bacon. So we said great! Bring us one. I stupidly thought it would be priced in the same realm. Nope, 17 bucks. I find that super annoying. I mean the food was good but really? 17$ for three pieces of bacon? It was clear we were there for happy hour, were looking at the happy hour menu. Seems to me something should have been said. I will not be back. The Keg is much better anyway."}
{"text":"For the price you pay, would expect better quality food.  Felt like I went to outback and multiplied bill by 3.   Food wasn't bad, but no where NEAR what they are charging for a meal.  Service is top notch though."}
{"text":"09/01/10  My first, and (so far) only, visit to Fleming's.  I give it 2.5 stars...  First thing I noticed was that it was very dark inside- a pet peeve of mine.  Second, the service looked either harried or aloof.  Where were the smiling faces?  It was 4:15 pm, which meant the doors had just opened 15 minutes ago, and there weren't many guests yet waiting to be seated.  (There were about eight people at the bar area.)  I soon met my server, whose cold gaze and unsmiling face already had me thinking maybe this place was not such a good idea.    After studying the menu, I decided I'd try the Prime Burger for $6. I also asked if I could sample a couple of red wines before ordering a glass of one.  I've been to many venues where this is not a problem, and sometimes, when I can't decide, even willingly offered!  This Fleming's location isn't one of these venues.  My query brought about a more negative change of attitude from my server, but I did get to try two very small samples before choosing a glass.  While I waited for the burger to arrive, I began to boot up my laptop- thank goodness I brought it, bec. the burger took a long time...  The bar area was filling up fast, and the servers started to look even more agitated that I was starting to wonder what was all the fuss?  Finally, just under 20 minutes later, my beautiful burger arrived.  Huge patty, smothered w/ cheese and topped w/ thick-cut, peppered, and smoked bacon, tomato, onion, lettuce, and a pretzel bun.  The one huge onion ring was a nice touch.  The burger was juicy (cooked to my specified medium), quite substantial, and delicious w/ the cheddar, veggies, and bun.  The thick-cut bacon, however, was so salty, that I had to take the slices off!  I was a bit disappointed, since it was such a hearty portion of bacon.  I wouldn't mind having another Prime burger, minus the bacon, for happy hour again, but I'd choose another location.   BTW, as I was enjoying the burger, I finally figured out why all the harried faces and the servers' hustle and bustle-- it seemed like everyone in the bar area had chosen the burger!  The table of six in front of me all had burgers... At $6, it's a steal for diners, but perhaps not expensive enough to garner a nice tip?  Hmm... well, not if the servers' attitudes continue to be cold and distant!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! The spreads they serve with the asiago bread is to die for! I had a ribeye special with shrimp and scallops and it was delicious! I recommend the blue cheese mashed potatoes as a side! It's very pricey... But if you are looking for a nice dinner out I highly recommend this!"}
{"text":"This is my first fine-dining experience.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed. I guess I expected a waiter like SpongeBob when he cleared his mind of everything but fine dining and breathing.  But what I got was just a regularly decent wait staff.  Nothing wrong with that, but I thought there'd be an \"experience\" to go along with the price here.  Nope.  We had a party of about 18 for a couple grads in the family.  I will say that we were all given good attention by our waiter, and he did a fine job earning his tip.  Its just that there wasn't anything special about the service that you wouldn't find at Applebee's or something.  The food was an experience, though. I had plenty of time to look the menu over a thousand times (late people, I swear).  The cheapest thing on the menu was in fact on the kids' menu.  But we were there for a special occasion, and it was a steak house that featured....steak.  So I would've kicked myself for ordering anything other than steak.  I may have paid $50 for it, but good lord that rib-eye was the best steak I ever had.  No exaggeration.  Like I said, I've never been to a restaurant like this, so maybe that's why I've never had a steak that good.  And I know there are probably competitors for the best steak in Chandler and the surrounding cities.  But for me, this is as good as its ever gotten.  If there is a steak that tastes better than this, I don't know if I could handle it emotionally.  I'd probably start crying.  I don't have to describe it.  If you eat steak, then you know what a good steak tastes like.  This one tasted like tha; probably better.  Flawless.  Of course, all sides are extra.  I ordered nothing but the meat, as I guess I'm a little too budget-minded for this place.  The pop I ordered took the place of potatos or a salad.    People ordered the lambchops, chicken, sliced filet mignon, crab cakes, and some other stuff.  The only complaint was about the french fries haha.  I didn't try them.  I will say that the wedge salads looked great and were very big.  Also, as far as the amount of food you get, the chicken seemed to offer the biggest portion size.  Honestly though, everybody paid so much for their food that I didn't want to ask anyone if i could try their stuff.  It really is a nice place, too...at least I think so.  The lights are dim so people won't see you frown at the prices.  The napkins are fancy...and so are the ones in the bathroom apparently, as my cuz brought one out to show me.  It is not quiet - but not louder than any other restaurant.  From what I read and hear people say, a fine dining place is supposed to be quiet and stuff.  If that matters to you, perhaps this isn't fine enough for you, because its just like any place else volume-wise.  Perhaps 3 stars is stiffing them a bit.  I mean, my meal was perfect...the service was good...and the ambiance was nice.  Am I just too much of a cheapo?  Did I expect too much of an experience for the price?  Maybe.  But I still feel that everything except the steak could have been just a tad better.  If there is ever another reason to go fine-dining, I'm sure I would suggest some place else instead of coming here again.  I saw what they have to offer...and despite the awesome steak, it just wasn't enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Even though I still think the bar area is lacking, now that I have been here a couple of times for dinner, I have no qualms about adding an extra star. Their steaks are phenomenal! A little pricey perhaps, especially since the sides are all a-la-carte. Oh, but their mashed potatoes are so delicious it's worth the extra money. And they have some great salads, too!  It's the type of place you really want to order multiple courses because everything they serve is great, not just the steak. And even though the beer options are limited, their wine list is fantastic. They have a huge selection, at many different price points. Pretty cool that they also give you an ipad to look it all over.  Even though this place is a chain, it's worth a visit if you are in the mood for a great steak. It definitely beats out the other options like The Keg and Ruth Chris. Get on their email list and you'll get the advertisements for when they do special stuff like give you a free gift cards when you spend a certain amount on dinner. They also sometimes do seasonal pre-fixe meals. Right now they also have a small plate special that will help keep the bill reasonable. Of course, you can always stick to the $6 sirloin burger in the bar. ;0) Just wait until the weather is good so you can enjoy it on the patio."}
{"text":"Excellently prepared entrees with great service.  The steak dishes are understandably the stars of the menu, and on Sundays they have a great special for prime rib: for $37 in addition to the prime rib you get salad, side dish, and dessert.  The prime rib itself is very tender, and perfectly cooked with a choice of 3 sauces to dip it in.  Another good deal is the spring special: Filet mignon and lobster tail with salad or soup, and mashed potato or green beans, for $35.  The filet was also very tender, perfectly cooked, and the lobster was full of flavor, and they will cut it off the shell for you if you desire.  The salmon is also good, perfectly seasoned and nicely cooked.  Service was very attentive, and even though I didn't need it, they offer black napkins to place on your lap if you are wearing something dark so that any lint from the white napkins on the table doesn't get on your outfit."}
{"text":"I stopped by Flemings for a Saturday night dinner with a couple of friends. I had reservations, so even though it was busy, we were actually seated 15 prior to my reservation time. The atmosphere was as I expected, although I was a little surprised that some people dressed more casually than I would have expected.   The service was excellent. The waiter took our drink order and brought a loaf of bread that came with two spreads - both were excellent! One friend and I ordered the petite filet mignon, which was served with Fleming's potatoes. My other friend ordered the regular sized filet mignon with a baked potato. I have never seen a larger potato. My two friends each had a salad - one Caesar and house salad. The salads were each around $9, but good size. The regular filet mignon was $32, while the petite with the potatoes was $26. I didn't really think the regular size was that much larger than the petite.   The steak was phenomenal! I ordered it medium and I can't recall a better steak that I have ever had. It was cooked well, excellent flavor and the perfect size.  The server continued to fill our drinks, brought a second loaf of bread and made sure we had everything we needed.  The total of 3 diet drinks, 2 salads, a baked potato, 1 regular filet mignon and 2 petite filet mignons with the included Fleming potato was $135. Not bad for 3 people. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Less than 6 months ago we visited this Fleming in Chandler and we were very disappointed. While the food was good the place was noisy and it seemed the clientele was not what Flemings is known for.  One would not expect to go to a Flemings and spend $200 on a dinner to listen to screaming kids. The family was out of place and not properly dressed for this type  of restaurant.  I would have gotten up and left but we were too far into the process.   Last nite we went to the Flemings in Scottsdale and was pleased with the experience. The Scottsdale Flemings was the high end experience they are known for.   While we wont return to the Chandler location one would need to decide if they want to spend that kind of money when they can go to Texas Roadhouse or Logan's for decent food costing a lot less and expect to hear kids screaming.   Mgmt needs to decide if they want to be a Flemings or a RedRobin and advertise as such."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and in years past, they've had a great veggie plate option. Tonight I was served an entire head of nearly raw unseasoned broccoli, two halves a roasted tomato, a few stalks of asparagus and a couple ravioli with no sauce. An entire head of broccoli?? Really? Just because I'm a vegetarian doesn't mean I don't know the difference between good food and a lazy, slap it on a plate if it's green kind of dish. For an upscale restaurant, they should know better. All they would have to do is create a pretty plate comprised of the sides already on the menu and it would be outstanding. So disappointed when the rest of the upscale restaurants in the community are showcasing fresh, delicious vegetable dishes, yet Flemings is falling short with a total lack of understanding of anything other than meat. Otherwise, great wine selection, service and I highly recommend the housemade burrata."}
{"text":"Spot on in every category! Food was great, aged steak cook to perfection. Service was second to no one. We go here on special occasions at least 2-3 times a year. Manager even brought us out a gift box of truffles and a $25 gift card when we were done. Maybe they do this for everyone but I liked the touch anyway. Not a fan of potatoes or mac and cheese but I could eat theirs every day of the week."}
{"text":"I took advantage of the AZ Restaurant Week. Reservations for 3 on Open Table for Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. When we arrived we were greeted and seated at a spacious booth. Zoe introduced herself and took our drink and cocktail orders as water, hot bread and butter were being served.   The 3 of us ordered off the AZ Restaurant Week menu (great deal even with the extra charge on certain items). For Starters we ordered the New England Clam Chowder and Caesar Salad. For Entrees we ordered the 6 oz. and 12 oz. Fillet Mignon, and Chilean Sea Bass. For Sides we ordered Fleming's Potatoes, Creamed Spinach, and Thai spicy green Beans. Desserts were Cheesecake and Walnut Turtle Pie which were box up because we were all too full. The steaks were cooked perfectly to our request. The Sea Bass was OK. All the sides and Desserts were excellent.   Service from Zoe was excellent. Food and cocktails were very good. I would definitely be back again. Hint Hint, you save some $$ if you buy the Gift Certificates for Fleming's at Costco and pay with them."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.. Steaks were perfectly cooked and the lava cake is to die for. Highly recommend to anyone wanting a great dining experience. Wait staff is highly attentive and really wanting to make your experience top notch.."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here and it was perfect!!!! The service was simply divine and the food was a-ma-zing!!!  The dinner was cooked to perfection and at the end of our meal we were presented with the most delicious dessert!!!!!!!  Truly we had a sublime experience! The ambience was romantic, classy and friendly. It was welcoming and professional at the same time.  At the end of our dining experience the manager brought us an anniversary gift - a $25 gift certificate to use when we return!!!!! I was so shocked and impressed with their customer - centric approach.  I definitely give Flemings five stars and highly recommend others to visit!!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my Birthday (7/17/2017) and so we went to Flemings to celebrate. Appetizer of Shrimp cocktail came out and it looked and tasted very good. Order was taken for dinner and my wife ordered a side salad as her meal because she wasn't super hungry and decided to add salmon to it to flare it up. I ordered the king crab leg entree but wanted soup to come out first, which it did a short while later along with my wife's salad that was supposed to be an entree. Now the salad, although premature, didn't come out as requested with Salmon on it (as my wife may have considered eating it since it was at the table already) so it was sent back. Soup was very good and flavorful and the servers and assistant were on point as far as pre-bussing and getting refills. Ok, now entrees hit the table. First impression was Blah.... presentation was severely lacking. My wife's salad is really just lettuce with a small filet of salmon on top. Not really much body to the salad and she said the salmon was very bland as she couldn't have butter... but you would have thought the chef could have gotten creative with it despite the allergy to butter/oil. Now my Crab legs, when it was placed in front of me it was 3 small pieces about 6in in length that were halved. That's it, very boring and portion size for amount paid was horrible. I inquired with food runner about the portion size confirming this was my entree and he said yes. My wife and I looked at each other in amazement. Approximately 5 min later or so into the meal one of our two servers came by and said \"your other half of your meal will be out shortly\". Well that's a relief, but when it came out it tasted like salt water from the ocean and was not edible. 50% of the cost was comp'd. The server also spilled Ice Tea on/in my wife's purse. When we get the bill, my wife was charged $44 for the salmon and I think $12 for the lettuce. A $56 salmon salad that was horrible at best. The salad was more expensive than my crab legs. So Sad, time to find a new place."}
{"text":"It only gets a 3 Star because of the customer service. I would barely give it a 2 for the food. Its been a few years and in another city that I frequented Flemings. Gigi gets 5 stars, she was great. I made reservations months in advance because I was coming to town to celebrate my moms 75th birthday...not realizing it was Restaurant Week. We had a party of 6. The waiter was VERY busy when we arrived at 6:30pm on time for our reservation. He brought us menus and seemed bugged from the beginning. He was not happy when my mom asked for the Pre Fixe menu. She eats smaller portions so why not? 2 ordered off the Pre Fixe menu and 3 of us ordered off the regular menu. (one of our party left because he became ill from travel and dehydration) I ordered the tuna steak which was cut in half, not a steak but a 1/2\" LITTLE piece that had been cut horizontally into two small pieces and was $47.00 The others ordered steak and a lamb chop which looked plentiful. We had 3 sides as well as salads and dessert. The food honestly was just okay. Not worth the $375.00 plus 20% tip which I paid but it was not earned. I am really disappointed in Flemings, it was always my go-to steakhouse even though I dont eat anything but fish...thanks for the memories."}
{"text":"Marginal food for very high prices. The fillet had a lot of fat in the bone in ribeye did not have much flavor and was tough. It's not right to charge top prices and deliver such mediocre food. That's the last time Flemings is going to rip me off. Call Dobbs to her tail looked like the size of a crawdad. They are living on their old reputation and I can't pack a couple of times lately hoping for what that restaurant once was."}
{"text":"I am giving this 3 starts,  because the Lady at the Front desk, really needs to drop her Attitude. You don't go to an expensive place like Fleming's, to get Attitude from their staff. If our Money is not good enough to her, we would gladly spend it elsewhere. I told my Husband I wish she doesn't get a share of the tips, because she didn't deserve it. It was Our Wedding Anniversary & we chose this restaurant as we had heard good things about the food. However, the Lady at the front desk was so Rude. She is the face of Fleming's. The first you see even before you have a chance to experience the rest of their staff or their food. Her attitude & rude replies, just put me off. We had a reservation for 7.30 p.m. & thought we would get there around 6.30, so that we can have a drink & hang around for awhile. However when we got their it was packed & the small entrance was full, with no place to stand or sit. I manged to get up to the desk & informed her that we had a reservation. Either she was angry with the crowd their or she didn't like her job. She was just rude & said you have got here an hour ahead. I informed her, that we got there early so that we could get drinks before dinner. To that she just said \"Oh! the Bar area is full\". We got to the end of the Bar Are, near the back door & with a few minutes wait managed to get the attention of the Barman & get ourselves drinks. I had the 'Club Clover' which was so very sour & didn't taste good at all. I had to ask for some Tonic water in it. My Mum was with us too & she couldn't keep standing there much longer. She is 83 years of age. I saw an empty table Outside & I asked her to sit there & I was seated on the ledge outside. The Tables outside were not being used Last night for Dinner, as the weather was bad. The winds were way too strong, with a slight rain & the leaves were in peoples food. A few minutes later, I went up to the girl in the front again & I asked how long it would be before we get a table. I was then Informed by a Gentleman that they were trying to get the guests who were seated outside, in to the Dining area due to the bad weather & it would be a little after our time of reservation. That's fair enough & I was fine with that, as that's the right thing to do. The people seated out there couldn't have their meal in that windy weather & they were there before us & it was fair that they should have a nice meal in peace. I informed the lady then, that I was seated outside & the door was closed due to the wind & if she could inform me when our table was ready. To this she tells me, \"No, You can't sit outside, unless we seat you\". I informed her that the weather was bad, (If she didn't know it already) & that there was no one who wanted to sit outside, except poor us, as we didn't want to stand by the door & get in the way of the servers & my Mum couldn't stand there & keep shuffling around to make space for the servers to walk. I told her I am seated on the Ledge outside. To that she says, \"Ah! Ok\". What is this place? A school? She tells us where we can sit & stand? So we can't sit on the chairs outside, even if there's no one &  they can't use those tables due to bad weather, but it's ok to sit on the Ledge. I was very upset with her & I told my Husband I really don't want to eat here. He was interested in eating there, because he had heard good things about the Steak. Anyway, I told him, I don't want to come here again. They are Rude. The Server RICKY at the Bar was very kind to us & kept looking for space so that my Mum could sit. That's how staff should be.Thank You very much Ricky.  We got our table by 7.30 as promised & I was ok by then as the lady who seated us wished us for our Anniversary & she was nice. Our server MARIE was so very nice. She was friendly & chatty. It was like she knew us all along. It made us feel so very special. All the Servers Attention to detail was amazing. They never left an empty glass on the table, always cleared & cleaned. I informed Marie about the Girl up front. She said she will let someone know about it. But I said it was ok & I was Happy now. Whoever the lady was, up front on Sunday 31st January, Please let her know that she really needs to leave her issues at home & not bring it to work. You can't spoil another persons day because you are not in the mood to be nice. People who come to dinner, come to relax, be happy & Celebrate. Just because it is her place of work, there's nothing we can do about it. I feel bad for her, if she has had a long day. But it was my day to celebrate & be happy & not be served with her Attitude."}
{"text":"This place is subpar for the price. If I'm paying $50 for just a steak, I expect to have an ambiance that is nice, romantic and dressier. Not people with kids, dressed in sandals and shorts. For two and 1 glass each of wine I spent $250...for meh steak and some mashed potatoes and mushrooms. It was our anniversary and I could have spent the same at a nice restaurant and gotten an even more special experience."}
{"text":"Overall, I was very impressed: *Bread service- delicious mild herb crusty bread with a duo of herbed feta spread and sundried tomato butter. Not a huge herb fan, but this excellent. *Prime Rib- My husband ordered it and it was cooked perfectly. *BBQ salmon- I loved this dish. A little crispy and just the right amount of sauce. The server steered me away from the sole bc she said it wasn't very good, so I'm glad I took her advice. Loved it! *Molten chocolate cake- I don't normally like this type of dessert, but the portion was so big, I shared my husband's. It was rich, but not obnoxiously sweet. Served with premium vanilla ice cream, tulle cookies, pistachios, and the most Delicious homemade whipped cream I've ever had. The only downsides: * Fleming's potatoes were a bit oily and didn't taste the jalapeño. Next time I'll try one of the mashed choices. * One of my pet peeves is when a menu lists a ton of ingredients for an item, and it seems to be fully inclusive but it's not. This is the case with the house salad. The menu listed cranberries, tomatoes, croutons, etc. but not onions. I didn't think to ask bc the description seemed very comprehensive. Well, there were red onions all over the salad I had to pick off and some type of shallots or other similar onion relative chopped into small pieces that could not be separated. I can't eat onions, so I tasted the salad but couldn't eat it. The lemon vinaigrette dressing was excellent, though. $ - We got two entrees, 2 salads, two side orders, one dessert, and 2 nonalcoholic beverages for $104. Not bad at all for the quality of food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"With the reviews that I received from people that I know personally, I was expecting much better food. The ribeye was almost bland and the flemings potatoes were undercooked. The service was great, but for the price of the food, I expected a lot more quality than what I received. I have had much better steaks for less than half the price I paid here. I will not be returning. It was a waste of my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Was there on Dec. 3.  They got the \"rare\" correct on the filet mignon but it was so horribly salty that I had to drink water throughout and guzzle 3 glasses after the meal.  My mouth was still so salty I needed more food just to get rid of the salty taste from the steak.  The veggies were very good and so were the mashed potatoes.  The dessert was excellent. When the lady (other couple we were with) remarked on how horribly salty her filet mignon was and how bloated she felt afterwards, I knew they didn't just screw up mine.  The chef is a salt freak.  It was a shame that someone knows how to cook steak to order (rare) but he destroyed it with so much salt.  I don't like to make a scene in front of other people and that is why I didn't send it back.  The servers were pleasant and the decor was very nice."}
{"text":"I don't usually go for corporate food; however, Fleming's is an exception. On my last visit I had a New York Strip, rare and ordered a host of sides for the table including sautéed mushrooms, sautéed spinach and mash potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of coolness in the middle. The sides were delicious and the service superb. Never felt rushed the entire evening. By Phoenix standards, Fleming's is a little expensive, but well worth the money."}
{"text":"Came here for my girlfriend's birthday. As I had told them before hand what we were celebrating they had a nice booth in the back waiting for us. Food was really good except for the dinner salad which was 11$ and I'm pretty sure it was the bagged pre mixed lettuce. They provided a gift card and some truffles for my girlfriend which was a nice touch. The reason for the poor review is are table was surrounded by gnats that were flying around us during our entire meal. One even landed in our wine glass and we had to brush them away which made for an unromantic dinner. We told the waitress and they called see us brushing the gnats away but made no attempt to move us. Not sure if it's a lack of cleaning in that area but avoid the back booths."}
{"text":"Awesome! Amazing service and so professional.  Food is amazing. We try to come here once a month at a minimum!  Try the Flemings potatoes!!!"}
{"text":"We had a craving for a nice steak dinner. We arrived and were seated immediately. The service was great. The staff was very attentive from the server, to the bus staff, to management. The steaks we're to cooked to perfection and the rest of the meal was great. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Not as nice as the Flemings I went to  regularly in Palo Alto.  It starts with sitting in the back room, which feels like a mid-level hotel restaurant.  It continues with the wedge salad, which is still above average, but not nearly as good as I'm used to (i.e., the bacon should be chopped and the blue cheese dressing should have more chunks of blue cheese).    The Flemings Potatoes were excellent.  My rib eye was underwhelming.  It didn't have the usual crust I've come to expect.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Went here with three couples on Valentine's Day and had the unfortunate luck of getting \"Aubrey\" as our server. From the very beginning, she came across as very snooty and condescending. It made the whole table feel uncomfortable to the point of almost requesting another server. During the entire meal, she made little snide remarks and felt the need to correct us about everything from the type of coffee they serve, whether the cappuccino was sweetened, what order we needed to order in and even how bad the blood Mary's were there. She didn't check on the food after served and seemed bothered by any questions about the menu. Overall, it was a very bad experience not necessarily because of the food but because of Aubrey.  Although we looked young, everyone at that table makes 6 figures a year with platinum Amex cards as you saw. Don't do that...be mean, judgmental and arrogant. You were officially the lowest tip I have left in the last 20 years. Flemings you deserve and have better servers. Please know that Aubrey is not representing the brand or the chandler restaurant well at all."}
{"text":"I came here recently for a special occasion dinner with my office staff and it was very nice.  The restaurant itself is well designed, with muted colors, dark woods and dimmed lighting.  The wait staff was neatly presented in crisp white shirts and clean, black service aprons.  We prearranged for a pre-printed dinner menu that was labeled as being for our party that night.  I thought that it was a nice touch, and I am well aware that it was also a clever cost containment measure since it also kept our staff from wildly ordering off of the regular Fleming's menu.  Our servers were all very gracious and attentive and took very good care of our party of about 25.  Our food was all brought out at the same time, which was no small feat on the kitchen's part.  Everyone seemed genuinely happy with their food, I didn't see anyone complaining about anything.    I ordered the petite filet, medium rare, and it was absolutely perfect in every way.  The meat was cooked perfectly and was tender, moist and delicious.  There were various sides served 'family style' raging from buttered corn to asparagus, and they were all very good as well.  As a dessert I ordered crème brulee, and it was deliciously creamy with the perfectly sugar crust on top.  My only complaint about my food, and it is minor, was that the crème brulee wasn't the ice cold temperature that I usually prefer.  I like my crème brulee pre-fired so that it has time to cool off before I eat it.  I don't care for warm custard, but it's purely a personal preference and I still thought the dessert was fantastic.  The only other thing I would point out is that many people aren't fans of the a la carte menu system, it can be annoying, and ridiculously expensive, to order every side dish seperately from the main entree.     That said, this was still a great experience in a wonderful restaurant.  I highly recommend it for any special occasion dinner as long as your budget will allow it."}
{"text":"I was going to write a review but after seeing all the one and two stars they have said it all for me few things I will add when you go to a nice steak house and you  have to flag down your waiter like you are having car trouble that is not good the steak was way over cook for medium rare in the dining room the table's are so close together the other table waiter his ass was in my ear half the night. That was the experience my wife and I had there"}
{"text":"This is a happy hour review only. I have never been for dinner. I love this place. The bar is kind of small, so you have to get there early if you want a seat for happy hour...or go on an odd week night. Camille H. already described the happy hour menu very well. In addition to the burger, the crab cakes are amazing - 100% crab meat and no filler/breadcrumbs. The cocktails are yummy - I had the white cosmo last night - delish!   I would give the place 5 stars, but am always unhappy with the service. They are all very snooty and pretentious. If they were just nice and real, I would love this place even more."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for mine and my wife's anniversary and it could not have been any better.  Brandon our waiter was amazing. Professional, courteous and so friendly.   The petite filet was so tender and flavorful and cooked perfect medium rare too. The NY strip special had three BBQ shrimp as well. Mojito and sangria for drinks, and then cremé brûlée for dessert.   It was a perfect evening."}
{"text":"Lots of money for not much quality. Yes, the ambiance was nice, but the focus of our trip, the food, was not worth it. I ordered the steak with the king crab. Kudos to the for actually making it lump crab versus shucking your own. However, it was so dry I had to ask for a replacement.  They were quick to get a new fresh order out to me. It was fine, but did have shell mixed in. :(  Another positive was that my steak was cooked to perfection.    We ordered the Chipotle mac n cheese and the peppercorn parm mashed potatoes.  Mac n cheese was flavorful and a great spin on a classic. The mashed potatoes were flavorless. Which made the dinner even worse... I was so excited to have them!   In the end we thought we'd redeem the night by getting dessert to go..  carrot cake and turtle pie. We've yet to eat them, but regretted the order as soon as we got the bill... they were 12 bucks each!!!  So in the end we spent $200+ tip on a meal that was worth maybe $100.   This place has some cool factors -ipads for wine and dessert options and great service, but I wouldn't pay that much more for those qualities."}
{"text":"This is somewhere I'd go maybe once or twice a year for a special occasion. The price runs, but you get what you pay for. This place is known for steaks and it does not disappoint. The appetizers and sides come in decent sizes as well. Their bread served with two different cheeses is delicious. When your food comes out, it's literally still cooking from the plate, which is great- shows that it's fresh. I would say to order your meat one above what you would usually - so instead of medium rare, get a medium. I get bad to send my steak back, but they did it without a hassle and were so kind. Bottom line up front, the steak is always fresh (juicy and flavorful), pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Happy hour is 7 days a week but only in the bar and patio.  Check out their website for the specifics.  The Flemings burger on the happy hour menu is a winner.  The wife and I usually sit in the bar area.  The service seems to be better in the bar area, and we mix and match the happy hour specials with the dinner menu items.  I am not big on chain restaurants but this place doesn't feel like a chain.  Was reading someone did not like the halibut. This place is a Steakhouse. Martini, steak, creamed spinach, asparagus, baked potato, wedge salad and a dessert you don't need. Now that's the ticket."}
{"text":"It's restaurant week and it was the first place I chose. The total came out to ~$50 a person, and I was surely disappointed. The Steakhouse didn't live up to expectations.   Here's their 3 course meal:  1)Fleming's Salad: Candied walnuts, dried cranberries, tomatoes and croutons. Rating: 3/5. The salad was decent, but not memorable. I thought the salad was very simple, nothing to rave over. When I think of a good salad, I think of Wildflower's combination salad. This one was just average.   2) Lite Filet Mignon served with Fleming's Potatoes. Rating: 3.5/5. Maybe it's because I had Sushi Roku's Filet Mignon 4 days prior (which was superb and steak isn't even their speciality). The Filet Mignon was good, I just expected it to be a lot more juicy and tender since it is a steak house afterall.   3) Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse. Rating: 1/5. The first bite was OK, I had two or three more bites expecting it to be much better but it didn't get better. Our waitress even said it was her favorite... but it was a total disappointment.   Overall, they've got great service and its a classy restaurant. However, I do not think I'll be coming back. All I could think about was this was the most expensive meal I've had in a year and for ~$50 it's a plane ticket from PHX to SAN."}
{"text":"Oh my god! This place is amazing! First of all you have to know that I am French. I enjoy American food but actually this place could be an upscale French restaurant.  Great place to bring a date if you don't mind to spend so much money, but actually it's worth it...  I had a beer, a great IPA, rotator from widmer brothers. Very nice.  Then we ordered some appetizers, some seafood, shrimps and crab and lobster plate. That was beautiful, fresh and the sauces with it were so good. I was already full after this but we had then one of their suggestion. A huge piece of beef for 2 with a very long bone. I can't remember its name. Sides : the corn and mashed potatoes with garlic. Insane. Great. We also had some onions, so tasty! Amazing! I was so full after this but I couldn't resist to try one of their desserts. I had the creme brûlée, and god it was perfect! I tried several times before but that one is the best I had in USA. Served with fresh berries.  And then, the coffee. You guys don't know what is a real espresso, I'm sorry to tell you this. But actually Flemings espresso is great! Oh and, I forgot the most important... The bread. They give you a big piece with sauces, blue cheese and a whipped butter. Oh my god this is the best bread I had in the area. Even if it's not as good as French baguette, that was pretty good.  I will go back to that place for sure, expensive one but worth it so bad!"}
{"text":"Great experience at Flemings Phoenix.  I've wanted try Flemings for some time.  We have one in my home town of Walnut Creek, CA., but have not yet got around to it.  On a recent business trip to Phoenix our hosts treated us to dinner at Flemings. We started with an array of appetizers. All very good. For my entree I had the rib eye and I have to say it was perfection! Cooked as I ordered and seasoned perfectly. The mashed potatoes and green beans were very good too. Desert was carrot cake. I'm not a big fan of carrot cake, but as far as they go I'm sure it was great.  The server was attentive and very friendly. Also, I ordered horseradish on the side and he remembered without being reminded. I don't take that for granted anymore.   The location was a bit strange. It's located in a strip mall. I'm accustomed to a Flemings being in cool, unique locations. But maybe it's a Phoenix thing. Everything is located in a strip mall in Phoenix.  I've eaten at Morton's and Ruth's Chris many, many times. Flemings is my new favorite and will have my steakhouse business going forward."}
{"text":"We had the Steak and Crab special and it was delicious!  Best dinner ever!  Dessert was So good!  Everyone wished us a happy anniversary!  It was an amazing and Kerry our waiter was great!  Great great service!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was average.  Nice patio but the Happy Hour has gone to the waist side!  The happy hour is no longer \"Happy\" drink prices will leave you feeling pretty sad!  For a $60 steak in Chandler sitting in a parking lot with a view of parked cars, I'll have to pass and find a more reasonably priced steak house."}
{"text":"Consistently very, very good.   A bit 'spendy' but you get what you pay for in this world.  I've never had a bad experience - ever! Great steaks, nice mixed grill choices, great shoestring fries, great drinks and wine selection.  When it's time for serious steak - I head to Flemings.  Even dinner in the bar is a great experience.  The bar can get crowded but isn't that the idea?  My wife and I will go grab dinner in the bar, have a great meal, catch the game on the 2 TV's they have, do some people-watching and have a nice time.  I've been to Flemings in San Diego as well and had the same results.  They get it!  Try it, you'll spend some money, but you'll really like it.  Beats Maestro's anyday, better than Durant's (in most cases), and better than Drinkwater's.  Right up there with Morton's and Ruth's Chris but a bit more affordable.....but it will never be Erie Cafe!"}
{"text":"My family arrived to celebrate my moms birthday! The hosting staff did a great job of seating us in a minimal amount of time. We had an emergency change in plans and they accommodated us quickly. They also accommodated the temperature of the room for our easily cooled friends. Everyone enjoyed their food. And the server was great UNTIL......two spiders crawled up onto our table right between me and my son. When I complained, I got some half assed excuse that they had just sprayed the night before from the manager. My husband, not wanting to look douchey and not like we were just trying to get a free meal, told them not to worry about it. But personally, I think they still should have done something about it. When you pay for a $500 meal, you don't want to deal with bugs. I was in the service industry for nearly 10 years, I understand the prejudice that goes on behind closed doors. I understand that they probably thought I was lying, but frankly, I couldn't care less. That's gross. I don't want to pay for a meal with bugs."}
{"text":"Why 3 stars?? When I eat at somewhere like Fleming's and pay the prices that they ask, my expectations are higher than usual: I expect to be impressed. I have been to Fleming's restaurants several times over the years, although I think the last few visits have been to the Scottsdale location.   My wife and I came for a prime rib special. The set menu included the meat, two sides, and two desserts. We were able to get a reservation for 7pm, but ended up getting free earlier, so we stopped by to see if there were any walk-in tables available. It is worth noting that walk-ins are probably difficult to come by here: the dining room was booked solid until our reservation time. Curiously, though, the dining room was basically EMPTY. We were offered a seat on the patio, which was fine. We were told that we could sit in the bar. Sadly, the tiny bar was already full of people who knew how this works.  Service: I have to give props to the waitstaff. The people handling our table were great. Our water glasses were never less than half full, despite being on the patio and that requiring a special trip during the first part of our visit. We seemed to have come at a transition time for some of the staff, so we didn't start with him, but Casey was ultimately our waiter and he was great.  Meat: While not my favorite cut of meat, I have roasted several rib roasts and do enjoy it. I am accustomed to a more round than blade-shaped cut of prime rib, but you can carve a slice from different places on the roast, and they will have different shapes. We ordered the steaks medium, and they came out a bit more brown (well) than mauve (medium). I know, I know: medium rare is the way to eat prime rib and how we usually cook it at home. Out, though, I've had too many experiences where that comes out still bleeding, so I asked for something a little more \"done\" this time. It was not worth complaining about, since it was pretty close and I don't like wasting food. I chalked it up to learning how Fleming's interprets doneness for prime rib. The meat came with three sauces for dipping the meat into: a creamy horseradish, an au jus, and a third one that had a bit of vinegar and spice to it. That was nice.  Sides: We had the Fleming's potatoes and the grilled asparagus. The asparagus was cooked well, but some of the stalks still had the hard part on the ends -- you know, the part that you usually snap off before cooking? It is still asparagus, but I would expect a little more care from a high-end place like Fleming's. The potatoes that impressed us so much last time were a little flat this time. They were creamy and good, but not amazing.  Dessert: My wife had the cheesecake and I had the creme brûlée. The second was by far the star of the show. Unless there is a reason you can't have it, get that one. Seriously. I guess the molten chocolate cake is popular as well, but I'll take custard over cake just about any day. My wife said the cheesecake was nothing special and that I had definitely made the better choice.   I generally like Fleming's enough to give it 4 stars, and, overall, the meal was fine, but it wasn't spectacular as I feel it should have been at a place like this. According to the other reviews, I apparently need to order the filet. For me on this visit, though, the Yelp 3-stars = \"A-OK\""}
{"text":"While the service was great, the food was mediocre at best and the steak's consistency was more than off. Also, my party was never asked how the food was nor how they could improve. However, the front of the house staff is very kind - and felt like the kitchen brought them down."}
{"text":"We had such a delicious meal~!   My Hubby and I split a Bone-In Ribeye, Flemings Potatoes, Ceasars Salad, Bottle of Merlot, and Creme Brule for desett~!  We split it all and we left stuffed~!   They recorked and sealed our bottle so that we could finish at home.  We had a late dinner...we called and arrived 15 min to closing....and they said they would still serve us.....Our Server Zoe was Awesome~!   She never made us feel rushed......She encouraged us to enjoy our meal and relax~!   We only have good things to say about this place~!   People were dressed business casual to dressy so everyone feels comforyable~!   ;)"}
{"text":"I was craving a steak so here we came!  Been awhile since I dined here.   iPad is left at the table for viewing drinks. I did not look at it.   Some bread and two flavored butters came with. We ordered the aged rib eye. ($58). Medium rare. Cooked perfectly throughout. I do fear that one edge was spoiled. However the seasoning was perfect. Enjoyed most of it tremendously. We also ordered the creamed spinach. Simply delightful.    Service was odd. Polite and engaging...yet distant. Waiter failed to mention the daily special.   A good steak."}
{"text":"What an amazing night we had.  We were looking for restaurants tonight in and near Tempe (we're visiting from Los Angeles), we found Flemings!  And then I remembered I  had a gift card for $100 that a friend had given me.  The portions looked so huge that we decided to split an entree, a potato and a salad. We even split a glass of wine!  It was a wonderful decision.  As we looked around, we saw all male/female couples and we pondered and wondered if male/female couples were treated any differently than us. So Janet casually asked our waitress  if she were homophobic. She said, \"No, not at all!\"  We told her we were celebrating our anniversary - 2 years of legal marriage and almost 24 years of being together.  She thought that was great!  How wonderful, we thought.  We even showed her a picture of our 3 month old granddaughter.  So we ate our delicious meal which was excellent, everything cooked to perfection- we were too full for dessert.  The check comes and it's almost exactly $100... $102 to be exact. Great!  I took out the gift card and was about to pay when the manager comes over and extends his hand and says \"I hear it's your anniversary!\"  \"Yes,\" we say.  He tells us that they are very supportive of us and he is so happy to tell us that the whole meal was comped!  We were more than thrilled!  Not only for the comped meal but for the recognition that we are as legit as any other couple.  They even brought us some Godiva chocolates to take with us.  Please patronize Flemings whatever your relationship status! We come back here about once a year and will certainly come back again - for our next anniversary!  All because we decided to speak up and be seen as who we are - a couple, in love, celebrating with good food and a great atmosphere. And instead of prejudice, we were met with compassion, equality and legitimacy. Made us feel very special. Megan was our server who was great even before she knew about us. And Anthony was the manager who was so genuinely kind and generous. We were really astonished!  The whole staff was great.  Oh and when one of the male/female couples left (one of the ones we noticed were very sweet and close to each other) they came over to us and said \"We overheard it was your anniversary and we wanted to tell you our congratulations!\"   Amazing!!  How far we've come. Thank goodness."}
{"text":"I came because AMEX gave me a $40 gift card, but I stayed because I was totes hungry.  It was very fancy, from the moment I sashayed my pretty little self in, to the time I was escorted to my white linened table, with their newfangled iPad wine and dessert list.  The parmesan crusty loaf was accompanied by both a feta and sundried tomato spreads, but I like Firebird's bolero loaf better.  The water tasted chlorinated though.  I could understand maybe bleach, ya know, for whiter teeth  Once again, I chose the wrong venue to sport my lederhosen and ICP mesh half shirt.  This place was popping, at 9:30pm.  It's nice to see the older generation still having date nights... with what appears to be their granddaughters.  :/  My waitress, Megan was an old soul and classy delight.  I am nearly transported to the days of old Hollywood, when people had nannies and rode elevators.  This is surely out of my element, but tonight, I'm self medicating, without the alcohol or Mexican quaaludes.  The bone in ribeye was near sheer perfection, with a taste that eschewed my typical topping of gefilte fish with cream.  The Thai green beans were a lil spicy, and a lot of fun.  And I'm pretty sure my Spidey senses were tingling thanks to some green Chile in the taters.  You know... PO-TA-TOES... boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew"}
{"text":"Consistently good Happy Hour. Good burgers and drinks. The downside is how crowded it gets and that the happy hour is only good in the bar. It should be entire restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I have heard a couple times that Fleming's has a really good happy hour, and since we recently moved into the vicinity, we thought we'd give it a try at about 530 on a Saturday afternoon.  Our visit lasted exactly 5 minutes.  That was long enough to have a seat at the bar and have the snobby bartender treat us like lepers for deigning to ask questions about the specials.  Judging by his terse and unhelpful answers, you're either in their little Happy Hour club and already have the options memorized, or you're out, so don't bother him.    I don't know if the bartender is trying to apply the Jehovah's Witness Heaven Limit to the number of people allowed to enjoy Fleming's Happy Hour, or if he was annoyed that he couldn't carry on an uninterrupted conversation with a coworker about scheduling work hours, or if he's just a knob, but we were interested in having a nice little time out, not cracking some bartender-induced secret code of Happy Hour enlightenment, so we got up and left.  We went across the lot to another restaurant and were treated to friendly service, great food, and good drinks, at a real Happy Hour with happy people."}
{"text":"We went to Fleming's for our annual Valentines dinner only to learn our reservation was missing. After a few minutes and fearing that we would be turned away, Gigi stepped in, pulled rank and seated us. Gigi has always been very gracious every time we have dined their. I dont think she takes a day off as she is always there. We then received OUTSTANDING service from Christa who was very nice and engaging. Later in the meal Operating Partner Mr. Jeffrey came by our table and apologized for loosing our reservation. As always, the food was amazing and was served at the appropriate time between courses, no long waits. The entire restaurant was running like a well oiled machine on this very busy holiday. No wonder this is our favorite restaurant that we frequent often. My sincerest thanks to everyone one mentioned for not only saving our evenings plans but for also making it another great Fleming's experience!"}
{"text":"Actually a good deal for HH..$6.00 burgers and crispy fries.  burgers are huge and definitely will fill you up. Service was pleasant and quick and the patio has outdoor misters which are OK for curly hair but not a beautiful blowout..lol.  If I return would like to try something different next time and the martini."}
{"text":"We've been to this Fleming's before and have always enjoyed the steaks. Not sure if the holiday rush is getting to them but the medium rare steak looked more like tartar. Also both of the prime burger buns were burnt. Overall, the seasoning of the food was substandard. The highlight was the excellent wait staff. Special shout out to Eric who was attentive yet unobtrusive.  He made the experience special for an otherwise disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that if you come here, you should not allow anyone but Nikky (Nicolette) to serve you. Not because others aren't excellent, but just because Nikky is extraordinary.   We visited with a group of 4 - 2 of my colleagues, and a senior level client. We were exceptionally obnoxious, and Nikki was brilliant, walking a tightrope of give and take good humor and unrivaled customer service.   We all had an absolute blast and the food was wonderful. We had the seafood tower for 4, and two of us had the petit fillet medium rare and a lobster tail.   The fillet was cooked perfectly - slightly charred on the outside and pink, warm and tender in the center without being chewy.   The seasoning was right on, adding the right amount of savory while allowing you to taste the perfection of the quality cut of meat.   The lobster was cooked well - with a hearty substance while maintaining its tenderness.   The Mac n Cheese was some of the best I've had at a steakhouse.   The wine list was extensive and even impressed out super-wine-connoisseur client.   We will definitely be coming back, and Nikky will be serving us."}
{"text":"Great overall experience!! I took my fiance for his birthday dinner - and from start to finish - every employee we encountered wished him a happy birthday! At the end, the waitress brought over a box of chocolates and a giftcard to come back for $25 off.  It was truly a good experience.  The food was delicious - expensive but very nice for a special occasion. The steak was absolutely delicious - melts in your mouth. He had the ribeye and he said it was the best steak he has ever had.  I had the chef's featured  entree - 2 four ouce bacon wrapped filets, 2 scallops, and 2 shrimps.  I asked for all shrimps and this was no problem at all!! Mine came with some asparagus as well.  Both entrees came out perfect - from the cook temperature to the specific personalizations to each dish!  The complimentary bread and calamari appetizer  we started with was sooooOOO yummy and the portion size was great! The sides left a little to be desired - we tried the Fleming's potatoes and the macarroni and cheese - both were only okay and did not stand out.  I would invest some money and time into revamping those sides - they did not compliment or stand out like the steaks did!! Similarly...the desserts were only okay for us. We had the donuts and the cheesecake. Overall, a great experience. I would definitely come back - especially on a special occasion - this place knows how to make that person feel good and recongized! I would pass on the desserts and would consider trying other side dishes or passing on them altogether. $10-$13 per side dish is too expensive to be mediocre."}
{"text":"We came back to Flemings to give them another shot after we had a bad experience for Easter Brunch and it was fantastic. The service improved tremendously and the food was perfect. My fiancé had the bone in rib eye and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  We come here on our Tuesday veggies-and-booze night when we pick up our CSA.  I think their happy hour is five items for $6 each until 7:00.  There are also some cocktails and wine.  One of those five items is their burger which you can order rare plus, it comes out perfect this way.  Nice and creamy (instead of dry and chewy), full of flavor and juicy with nice thick pieces of bacon on it.  This might be our new favorite."}
{"text":"Tonight my wife, daughter, and I went for a nice dinner. We ended up on the patio because the restaurant was so busy and we hadn't made a reservation.   Long story short, our waiter told us he was the only one waiting on the patio patrons. The service was slow.  The food was amazing and when the manager asked how our experience had been, I was honest about our disappointment on the slow service.  He was world class and apologized immensely. He then offered us a complimentary dessert and comped our appetizers.  A world class experience was recovered because of his acute awareness of customer expectations.  Hats off and we will be back"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. They provided wonderful service, and food was correct to order. Cheap burgers from 5 - 7pm!!! Mature people that work there."}
{"text":"We had an amazing anniversary dinner. The wait between appetizer and main course was a little long but we had amazing service. The seafood appetizer was delicious, we had the rib eye special of the evening with crab legs on the side and it was amazing. They gave us a gift for our anniversary to come back next time. It was our first time there and a great experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for that ultimate Fleming's experience you've saved up months for - don't bother coming to this location. Please make the drive up to Scottsdale where the standard seems to be a lot higher than here.   It's pretty packed during Happy Hour but because of that, I get the feeling that the servers in the bar and patio area know they're getting shafted with probably lower than expected tips thus, lower customer service. I sat on the patio for dinner and was not expecting to spend my night constantly waving at the server like I was at dim sum - not here of all places.   Food is great and pretty much on par with other locations, but the service here is like nails on a chalkboard. We sat on the patio and if you order anything other than water, don't expect the server to come by and give you another refill. It's best you measure out your sips for the rest of your dinner. In the time it took to get another beer, you would have sworn they were self-brewing in the kitchen because that's how long it took. Asked for bread service but it never came, even after our entrees came and we asked a third time. What was pretty irritating was that all the other parties who sat down after us in the same area were getting great service, refills, bread, etc. They were all bigger parties and ordering wine glass after wine, so I had a guess as to why he would baby their tables and not ours. Regardless, never in my wildest dreams did I think that my childhood dream of being invisible would come true, but this server definitely made sure of it. Not as exciting as I thought it would be.   We told the manager what was going on and all he could say was that our server had 7 years of experience and was amazing at what he did. If only I had a manager that could say such amazing things about me while I ignored all my responsibilities at work and watched YouTube all day. The manager offered us free dessert, but it didn't really matter to me especially since I did not come for dessert. I came for the upscale ambiance and opportunity to wow the company I was with. I thought I was at Fleming's and left feeling like I was at Chili's."}
{"text":"The 5 for 6 'til 7 is so awesome and such a great deal! I wasn't sure the first time we went if we should dress up or if it was okay to wear jeans and a nice top but everyone was either in their business casual work clothes or jeans. I would recommend getting there a little early because it fills up quickly! We got there at 6pm and by 7pm it was pretty full.  I have recommended this to so many of my co-workers and friends to try out and so far anyone that has gone has come back to me saying what a great time they had and how surprised they were with the 5 for 6 'til 7 deal :)"}
{"text":"Always fantastic service! Everything on the menu is pretty much a la carte. So when we go, we order our own steaks and a bunch of sides to share. I always get the filet mignon. Absolutely delicious. The creme brûlée is also amazing! Creme brûlée is my favorite dessert, so it's nice to indulge here. I also can't stress enough how great the service is here. The staff is clearly well trained and everything during dinner here always goes smoothly. Can't wait to dine here again!"}
{"text":"What a special treat!  We were thrilled to attend the cooking demo that both Chef Garcia and Sous Chef Compton personally held at the Taylor Morrison's event.  Thank you for an awesome time!  Fleming's is one of our favorite restaurants and their people are the very best in the industry."}
{"text":"Great steaks. Great sides. Good wine. However, avoid the bar, oddly enough, especially during happy hour. The appetizers, while cheap, are not nearly as good as what I would have expected based on the steaks and other options I have really enjoyed in the dining room. The bar and the dining room just seem to operate on two different wave lengths. If that were not the case this place would be a solid four stars for me."}
{"text":"My wife and I were celebrating our 16th wedding anniversary and chose Fleming's for dinner.   From the time we arrived to the time we left we were treated extremely well. Our server Emily made our experience wonderful. From the drinks, to the meal to dessert, we were totally pampered for our evening. The food was stellar, the drinks were spot-on and the gifts provided by the restaurant were incredible"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a 2 star review but it wouldn't be fair because of one person: our server last night. The food was outstanding, Main Filet, Dry aged rib eyes, petit filet ... all cooked to perfection. Yet I feel like the service was that of a cheap corner restaurant. Party of four, and the server's attention was directed to only one person. From the wine to the food, Every time he came to check on the table only one person was asked, three of us felt totally ignored, it wasn't until our meals were halfway done that he asked the rest of the table how our food was, with a quick dismissive scan. I felt truly embarrassed with my dad, he was visiting us and we raved about this place, so we took him for dinner there. He is hard of hearing, so I had to ask him a few things regarding his dinner and instead of being sensitive towards this, our server just asked my boyfriend questions, as if he knew what we wanted or needed. Mixed feelings about this dinner - I have been there before and this is the first time it happens!!! I hope the server was just having a bad day, but come on! Is not like the steaks are $9.99, and even if they were you don't make a good name and expect the business out of past reputation. It's an ongoing process. Step up with your server training Fleming's!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lot going for it. We celebrated our anniversary here before seeing Phantom of the Opera, and they definitely kept the night classy. They fell short of five stars, but in ways that made 4 stars an easy decision.  It started with a reservation. Perhaps we just aren't regulars, but people would come in after us and be seated before us for the exact same reservation, exact same time. This is the moment I knew we'd have time issues.   However, we were wished happy anniversary by everyone as we sat, and they signed a card and gave a small box of chocolates. The service tried to be great, and nearly succeeded. The place was loud, but in a festive kind of way. Not quite romantic, but fun nonetheless.  The servers took great care of us, making solid recommendations and being generally humorous and engaging. Unfortunately, they also brought out the calamari appetizer AFTER the steak, and only after being reminded. Yet I can't completely throw them under the bus, because they took the calamari off the check.  And that calamari. Amazing. And that New York Strip. Perfection. And that chicken. Total win. Even the gnocchi was great. The salad sucked, but it was a basic Caesar. Just wish they'd used something other than hearts in there. But the rest was amazing.   Again, overall amazing food, and a solid recovery that kept this a four star experience even with the blunders. I still left wanting to come back. And come back we will."}
{"text":"Once again my wife and I made our annual pilgrimage to Flemings for our anniversary. This place is upscale and pricy, so we only go here for this special occasion. The food here is extraordinary. Why else would we go to a dimly lit high priced restaurant? We had reservations for 5:30 on a Sunday. We usually go on Sundays because that is when they have prime rib, (my favorite).   I started my meal with the French onion soup. The soup has bold beefy broth loaded with onions topped with melted gruyère and parmesan cheeses. Piping hot and gooey, the cheese compliments the onion soup well. Next I was served a salad of my choice. I tried the new wedge salad for the first time. This will be my standard choice in the future. The head of lettuce was quartered into a wedge hence the name new wedge. The salad was topped with slab-cut bacon, blistered tomatoes, crumbled gorgonzola, pickled red onion, toasted pepitas, danish blue cheese dressing. The salad was crisp and creamy, tart and tangy all in the same bite.  The main course I chose was the prime rib dinner with a side of Fleming potatoes. The Fleming potatoes are a perfect side to go the prime rib. Potatoes made with cream, jalapeños and cheddar cheese baked to perfection into a loaf. The creamy slightly spicy flavor compliments the salty savory flavor of the prime rib and any of the 3 accompanying sauces.  The highlight of the meal was of course the prime rib. Cooked to medium rare and served with a trio of sauces, au-jus, drawn butter, and horseradish sauce. The outside was crusted with cracked pepper. It was a generous cut of meat. I was only able to eat half. I wanted to save room for dessert so I had the other half boxed to go.  Dessert was walnut turtle pie consisting of homemade caramel, walnuts and chocolate baked in a chocolate pie crust. This dessert is rich and decadent, the perfect finale to a great meal.  Because it was our anniversary and we stated so on our reservation we received a $25.00 Flemings gift card which we put toward our bill. We still paid a lot for the meal, but it is worth it for the quality of the dining experience. Flemings will continue to be our anniversary tradition for years to come."}
{"text":"Great food, service is impeccable, never disappointed BUT wish creamed corn never left menu!"}
{"text":"Note that I went here for happy hour  I ordered their $6 happy hour burger and at my server's commendation the happy hour carpaccio.  Not sure if it was because of happy hour or not, but the burger I received was sort of small for one with a normal retail of $13.95. Lets break it down into parts.  The bun- fairly dense and hearty bun that soaked up the juices and didn't fall apart on you when eating it. Not really the most flavorful, but a good base for the burger.  The patty- smaller than the bun (not a good sign), seemed to be a coarsely ground and actually really juicy. Just the way I like it, except for one major flaw. I asked for the burger to be cooked to medium, and the burger I received was well done. Not sure I like that an expensive steakhouse overcooked it's beef. The patty was a little too salty too.   Toppings- 2 small pieces of bacon that probably would have made 1 regular sized strip. The lettuce and tomato were cheap though and there was no onion to go with the burger. (reviewing my photo there was onion,  it was just so small and thin that I couldn't taste it). This level of veggies I would expect in a fast food place. Cheese was nicely melted but wish it had a stronger flavor.  Sides- the fries were decent, but the portion once again small.  The carpaccio wasn't that good to me. I liked the toasted Parmesan bread they served with it, but the beef itself didn't seem that fresh to me with a pale color that was starting to turn grey around the edges. Maybe the beef was perfectly fine, but it just didn't look that fresh to me. Of course maybe I just didn't eat it fast enough either. I felt like I liked the carpaccio at Va Bene down the street a bit more.   So why did I give this place a 3 star review although I didn't really think the place was that good? Because I think the price I paid was worth the meal I got, no more no less. Not a value buy like I was expecting, but decent overall."}
{"text":"Love to come here for happy hour. The happy hour burger is delicious and an absolute steal. They have a ton of wines by the glass and have drink specials too. The iPad wine menu is kind of cool but I found it a little hard to find things... Might be because there is so much to look at."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great steakhouse with such a nice ambiance.  The wait staff is superb, very professional and taught very well.  They use technology and everyone is welcoming. They educate on each wine that they offer.  We had such a fun experience with Moscato and Moscow Mules but got down to business with the wonderfully enjoyable food they served.  I had the peppercorn steak with chipotle mac and cheese and sauteed mushrooms.  The dish was well done and its actually making me salivate as I remember how tasty it was.   Worth every dime."}
{"text":"When only a serious cut of beef will do, prepared and served by another (instead of your backyard grill)--go to Fleming's. Very nice restaurant with professional waiters, a great menu, and tasty wine list.  Although, I've eaten several fine meals at Fleming's, the reason for this recent review is a new discovery: the PINNACLE of hamburgers for $6 dollars at happy hour. A half pound Prime meat hamburger, with smoked bacon, and choice of cheddar, gruyere or blue cheese on a toasted challah bun. Damnation!! best hamburger I've ever eaten. Did I mention 6 bucks at happy hour? Phenomenal."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. I had the Chilean sea bass and Fleming potatoes, with a lava cake for dessert. Husband went for the lobster tails. Definitely a treat!"}
{"text":"A+ SERVICE and 5 stars! We love the steak (my fave is the RIBEYE). They have great wine selections and their service is always great too!"}
{"text":"I came here for one of those financial dinners, which allowed me to invite 3 friends.  I told my friends I wasn't gonna sit with them cos I see them up to 4 times a week, and I wanna meet new people.  i sat with a single lady, and a Korean couple.  The four of us had such a great time talking, that we are going to meet in another week for Korean BBQ.    We all had the 8 oz filet mignon medium rare.  i wish mine was rare as i asked for rare/med rare.  oph well, it was tender, quite gamey tasting, like Ruth Chris' filet, but oddly, filet mignon at The Keg is NOT gamey, not that I mind gamey.    i prefer the Ruth Chris filet because of the butter, ummmm smells soooo good, like frying in butter on your plate.  But the Flemings version was served to us with no meat juices or butter at all.  I thought the meat was rather dry, and wished for something to dip in.  We were given asparagus, which \"was not enough:\" and fortunately the Koren lady asked for more asparagus and they brought another plate, really hot!  Good!  Also had the usual mashed potatoes with the skins, which was quite sticky and gooey.    That caesar salad with crispy proscuitto, quite a small salad, can't believe it costs $12 on the menu.    Bread was not baked crispy enough, if I were not with these other people who already touched the bread i would have sent it back for more baking, or asked for extra crispy.   But our dinner was free to us by our host, so I can't be too vocal not paying for it.    The cheesecake was really really delicious, it was not so heavy and had light berry sauce on top and a dollop of whipped cream.  What is heavy?  TJ's brand of cheese cake is HEAVY TO MEEEEE.  I asked for my cheese cake to go, but ended eating half of it, just couldn't stop.    I really enjoyed the company I was seated with, and service was excellent.  We were in a small meeting room which was well-lit.  I would not have liked to sit outside this meeting room as I like bright lighting on my table."}
{"text":"I have to say that I fought going here tonight for dinner. I mean, I am in Arizona and there are Fleming's restaurants in California, so like any good yelper of course I'm going to want to experience the best and most unique restaurants that Arizona has to offer. However, this just so happens to be my brother's favorite restaurant so he won because this was our family's last supper, of sorts, before we leave him by his lonesome in Phoenix. Well off to Fleming's we went and it was fabulous. For a chain restaurant Fleming's does it right; nice decor, impeccable food, excellent service and over 100 different types of wine. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list and checked up on us at all the appropriate moments. The additional support wait staff was very attentive so much so that when (like the klutz that I am) spilled the last sip of wine all over myself, he quickly took my sweater to the bathroom where he blotted it with ice water and handed it back to me in a Fleming's handle bag and recommended that I take it to the dry cleaners and ask that they treat it with the spray that removes wine stains. What a sweetheart! We ordered the sweet chili calamari to start along with a bowl of roasted corn chowder soup with lobster, shrimp and potatoes. I ordered the petite fillet mignon cooked medium rare, my bro had the 20 oz steak and my mom had the Mahi Mahi. All of it was amazing. We finished it off with creme brule and our bill was about 2 bills. Overall it was a great experience and I'm glad my brother won this round."}
{"text":"Just ate the tuna tacos: this is a $10 plate of chips & salsa - a very very oniony salsa. My wife won't even kiss me now my mouth tastes like an onion. The \"tacos\" fell apart in the first bite. In past visits I've left feeling violated, like my mouth was forcefully overstimulated. My stomach vomitus with over seasoning. Lastly, no draft beer. Seriously?! Not everyone wants a $30 glass of Cabernet. Some of us like beer, and bottles just don't taste the same. Shame on you Flemings ~ I'm over your overpriced meat, over flavored dishes and over confident menu. You are off point."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and often wondered why this Fleming's ratings were so significantly lower than the other Fleming's. Think I found out why. Management. I called to make a reservation for a family birthday party of 8 and asked for the small semi-private dining room. The hostess confirmed that the room was available and happily booked our date. Twenty minutes later the manager calls and says unless I wanted to guarantee spending $1300, I couldn't reserve the room. After some discussion I said let me get this straight, that unless I guaranteed to spend $1300 I couldn't reserve that dining area, that no one else has asked for it, and that if no one else does ask for it, then you will just make it part of the main dining area. He said that's right. I told him to keep the room and we would go to Mastro's. He said ok - not even an apology!"}
{"text":"Have had some fine meals here in past times. Tonight, I feel ripped off. 4 mature adults with a great deal of dining experience. All agreed, prices went up, quality went down. I had the days special, halibut. For$50, a 6-8 oz. Portion of mediocre, tasteless previously frozen fish, with 4 stalks of grilled asparagus.  The$64 Bone in ribeye , supposedly prime... I don't think so. A bit tough, gristly. Wife's so called shoestring fries were a mess of limp ,lukewarm crap. Had them removed, replaced with nice baked potato. Wedge salads and onion rings pretty good.  Berries and cream dessert a real disappointment. Handful of grocery store berries and a glop of over whipped cream. 4 people, no booze, $360. Service was pretty good.  Overall, nothing special here anymore."}
{"text":"First review I've decided to write for a restaurant so far, but felt I had to after reading dozens of reviews prior to coming in, with certain expectations that were not met, and feeling that I wish someone had written what I'm going to write.   To start off, I'd like to come out and say we did not make it past a round of drinks here. This review is strictly related to the \"experience\", or in our case, lack there-of. We left after 30+ minutes, in large part due to the large gaps in time between the server coming back to check on us.  Our unfortunate experience was rather short, so I'll try to keep it to the point. It was the wife and I's 4 year anniversary. I made same-day reservations for a Friday night (9/5) at 7:15. We pulled up and used the valet out-front, which was nice. We walked in and were seated within a few minutes. So far, so good. We were seated at a 4-top in the middle of what I can only describe as a cattle yard. Everyone seemed so close together, with booths surrounding the room, apparently the only good seats in the house. The wife likes to sit next to me, so I thought I'd ask to switch. Upon getting up to request a booth, I was told they had already sat it... Oddly enough, said booth wasn't sat for another minute or two after I had returned to my seat. Not a big deal, as the experience I was hoping for could easily make up for it.   I returned to my seat in time to greet our server (40+ yo woman) who had only been there briefly. Rather than offering her name, all she said was \"Cocktails?!\". My wife said she was interested in a glass of wine, and asked for a possible suggestion. The server handed her an iPad to look through instead of, ya know, imparting knowledge that a seasoned server should do at a \"fine dining\" establishment. We told her we'd need a few minutes to look through the cocktail list, and upon her return she then asked us if we're interested in hearing the specials for the night. I wanted to cut off her butchered attempt at telling us the features, but didn't have the heart to do so.  Their beer/wine menu does not allow one to discern if the beer is draft or bottled. So, while I did not ask, I was not told how the beer I ordered would come, but at least my $7 bottled beer was delivered with a glass. My wife ordered a glass of wine, and at that point, I handed the server my card when she asked if we'd like to start with any appetizers. Clearly knowing something was wrong, she bleakly stated, \"Oh, just the drinks? But it's your anniversary! I hope it's not something we did.\" and walked away.  The way she said it, she clearly could not care less and seemed glad for us to be leaving. I'm under 30, so maybe she assumed we were cheap. Both my wife and I have worked before in the restaurant industry for a combined 12+ years. We left a 50% tip to dismiss any conclusion on their part that we are \"cheap.\"  While I am sure the food is great, as that's all the other reviews seem to cover, if you are looking for an intimate restaurant to visit with your significant other and are looking for a level of service that is on par with the price, then dine elsewhere. I personally am not willing to pay $50+ for a steak and $10 for a baked potato if the level of service I receive is that of a 2am visit to Denny's. I've only been in AZ a year, so perhaps the bar is much lower here for fine dining than it is in Seattle (El Gaucho, Palisades, Canlis, Daniel's Broiler, Salty's, etc).   Very discouraging visit for our first time. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I like to wine and dine at the fancy places for special occasions. I decided to take him to Flemmings in Chandler for his birthday because I didn't want to drive to Scottsdale, and I remember the Scottsdale one being really good with excellent service. This place, not so much. Half the restaurant was filled and there were like 3 servers walking around. We waited a good 10 minutes before anyone came to get our drink orders. The house bread is pretty good but the two cheese spreads it comes with are not very good. We asked for regular butter and that never came out. We got the calamari with sweet chili and that was pretty good. The presentation was really sloppy though, sauce all over the side of the plate and just played really sloppy. I got the Alaskan king crab legs and the husband got the bone in 20oz ribeye. The crab legs were smaller and the meat was dry in some parts, soggy in other parts, and just wasn't the quality we were expecting. The prime rib was cooked perfect medium rare but the flavor was just lacking. The spicy Thai green beans were pretty good and the flemmings potatoes were ok but really heavy. No complimentary dessert for husband's birthday but we got a box of truffles and a $25 gift card. Overall ok but will probably go to Steak 44 or Capital Grille before coming back here."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the Flemings near me, so it is always great to discover a new location.  Located in a shopping center, there is certainly plenty of parking.  We had reservations and were seated immediately.   I had the Flemings martini, and a glass of red wine, along with a daily special featuring steak and tempura shrimp, along with a wedge salad and my date had a scallops dish, along with red wine.   The wedge salad is amongst the best you'll ever find.  They will even chop it up for you if you request.  Savory and delicious.  The steak and tempura shrimp had better flavor on the steak side of things, although friend anything is not my favorite lately.  The shrimp did come with a delicious dipping sauce.   The wine list is amazing and something Flemings is famous for.  We even requested a dessert, which normally takes some time to prepare, and I was concerned, as we were there right at closing time.  But they were gracious and prepared everything to our liking.    The dining room is always elegant, although there was a very loud mouth gentleman talking at top volume about drugs and medical marijuana dispensaries that did not want to seem to quiet down.  At all.  The dining room was empty when we left, as we were the last ones there.  It is strange that this town closes so early on a Thursday, but truly it was a ghost town after 10pm.  Even the waitress was walking to her car as we left.     Overall a wonderful elegant dining experience, and I'd recommend any Flemings locations."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Flemings for our annual Valentines dinner. When we arrived we discovered that our reservation had been mysteriously lost! Overhearing our conversation, Gigi took over and immediately seated us, apologizing for the lost reservation. She is always so welcoming and friendly! She seems to be there every time we dine at Flemings. What a rare find Flemings has in her. She knows customer service and she uses it! Krista our server was incredible! Very friendly and engaging. The service we received was some of the best ever. Krista really seems to love what she is doing and it certainly shows. Everything was served with the right amount of time in between, never a long wait. And of course the food is incomparable and cooked to perfection.  Towards the end of the meal, Operating Partner Mr. Jeffrey stopped by the table to offer his apologies for our lost reservation. My heartfelt thanks to all the above mentioned names for making what could have been a disaster into another incredible meal at an incredible restaurant, Flemings!"}
{"text":"We like to go there after work for Happy Hour on the patio.  They have 2 Happy Hour menus and until tonight, we have ALWAYS ordered off both, with no problems whatsoever.  Tonight, however was a different story.  We were charged regular prices for most of our bill and when we asked about why, the waiter was dismissive and rude about it, loud enough for neighboring tables to hear.  He did take the bill and come back very quickly, saying that the bill was correct and just dropped it on the table.  I would have expected a manager to stop by and say something, anything, but evidently the managers there do not care if their tables have issues, they just hide in the back.  At no time, did we ever see a manager that night, but for 5 minutes (before we ordered) while she lit some patio heaters, then she disappeared the rest of the night.  I would expect them to do at least one table touch during the meal.  I guess it's not a \"Fleming's thing\".  All in all very disappointed with the service, the confusion regarding the bill, the menu and the way it was handled and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Wasn't a great experience. Sat on the patio, service was extremely slow (wasn't busy) and inaccurate. Appetizers (ordered about 5) were underwhelming, amongst other things, calamari was very soggy. Maybe skip this location."}
{"text":"Mostly good.  However, I went there one night and ordered the special which turned out to be a take on steak oscar.  Well the oscar part of the steak (i.e., the crab) was horrible.  Most other nights we've been there things have been good."}
{"text":"The food is definitely good, but I didn't think it was substantially better than other restaurants to justify the high price.  I had the filet with a side of the fleming's potatoes.  The steak was cooked how I like and was very good.  The potatoes were fine, although personal preference would be for a less creamy alternative."}
{"text":"I have been here and the one in Scottsdale many times before and it's been great. Tonight was mediocre at best. My crab cakes were gross and didn't taste fresh. My sisters steak was so undercooked it had to be sent back. My husband's steak could've walked off of the plate because it was nearly raw. I was really disappointed. The waitress did not tell us about any specials and I even asked about Monday funday that I had gotten an email on and she did not even describe the 3 course deal to us. Not impressed. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"For an up-scale chain restaurant, this place is pretty good. Service is excellent, the food was very good and best of all, what an extensive wine list!!   Flemings I think is grabbing onto the future and running with it! For their wine list, they will hand you an ipad which then you may procede to search their over 100 varieties and choose a glass or bottle to your liking. What is so neat too is the fact that each wine has a flavor profile description - so much better than having your waiter try to describe to you each wine or him guessing what you would like.   The food itself was pretty good, a bit peppery...but not overdone or anything (you better not get over done at a place like this) We went on a Sunday which turned out to be a good idea...every Sunday they have a special where you may have a prime rib steak with your choice of side and a salad and dessert for $29.99. Not too bad considering you will pay $25-40 per regular entree.   The ambiance is very classy, service is wonderful (the waiters even have their own buisness cards...weird, huh?) you can't go wrong with Fleming's for a special dinner or even just because. :)"}
