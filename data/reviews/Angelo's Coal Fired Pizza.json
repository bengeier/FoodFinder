{"text":"Saw that Angelos just opened up and thought we'd give it a shot. The hostess was not very welcoming however once the server arrived we had a great experience. We had an appetizer and two pizzas. Ended up taking a full one home."}
{"text":"The service here is very good, the staff are all very friendly and helpful and make suggestions about pizzas and other menu items. The pizza is good and the ingredients are fresh, I would recommend it if you are in the area :)."}
{"text":"Amazing thin crust pizza, best in the neighborhood by far! Will be back to try other options on the menu, manager very accommodating offered great service. Thanks Angelo's!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and have been meaning to try this place for awhile.  Despite the exterior,  which is a bit drab,  the interior is lively, warm, and cozy!  We came around 6:30pm on a Friday and the place was already buzzing.    With help from our waitress,  we chose to order the polenta fries and meat lovers pizza which was just enough food for 2 people. Both were amazing! Great mix of flavours and texture. The thin crust on the pizza was perfection.    Service was good and prompt. Overall, an excellent time at Angelo's!"}
{"text":"Came to Angelo's for dinner and had a great experience.   To start, we ordered a few cocktails. My girlfriend and I ordered a Manhattan and a Negroni, and both were well made, strong, and very reasonably priced for cocktails in the downtown Toronto area.  For appetizers, we grabbed the coal fired chicken wings and the caprese salad. The coal fired chicken wings were nicely toasted and had a big pile of caramelized onions sitting on top, giving it a very sweet taste from the onions. The caprese salad was very fresh and refreshing, and tasted great.  We ordered two pizzas for the table: a margherita pizza and the goodfella pizza. The unique pizzas at Angelo's are thin crust, and fired in a huge coal oven, which give it a nice toast on the bottom of the crust. This coal fired, thin crust pizza provides a solid crust that holds up well to the sauce and toppings on top of it, without being overly chewy or crunchy or soggy and weak.   Both pizzas were delicious. I did wish that I chose to be a tad bit more adventurous with my pizza selection because they have some great looking pizzas on the menu with interesting ingredients that I'd like to come back and try.  After the pizza, we got two pastas: a pan of orecchiette, and a pan of strozzapreti. The presentation of the pastas being brought out in a pan were quite novel, and really made it feel like we were eating in the home of a close Italian friend. The orecchiette was tasty, though the pasta was a tad overcooked and underseasoned, but the sausage was such a good flavour that I let it be. The strozzapreti was delicious, where the pasta and the veal ragu were so perfectly paired that I almost finished the entire pan myself.  For dessert, I grabbed a salted caramel and pear gelato and we shared a bombolone, which is like a fried donut filled with chocolate. I'm not a big dessert guy, but I absolutely destroyed that gelato, which I am told is made in-house, and I wanted to not share that bombolone.  Overall, fantastic meal at Angelo's. I can't wait to come back and try out more of their pizzas and pastas! In addition, they have a great lounge area and/or patio, that could be a great meet-up-and-drink spot."}
{"text":"Went to this new pizza establishment for lunch. Had a great experience. The pizza itself is thin crust and tastes amazing. The truffle pizza is one of the most memorable pizzas I've tried in recent history! Price range is from $13-$24 for pizzas. They also have some salads which are pretty good in the $12-$16 range and chicken wings. I was not a huge fan of the chicken wings as they were a little burnt but some people may enjoy it. The bathrooms are very clean & modern as well. They have seating outside and inside. Street parking"}
{"text":"I was recommended by a friend to try Angelo's and left with no disappointment. Service to start is very welcoming and considerate they had the most polite workers who are as friendly as they are courteous.   My friends went for the more common approach and ordered their Spapghetti and Lasgna both which are superb and better than your usual classics especially the Lasagna the flavour, balance, and textures were well above average.   However, I went on the liberty of trying their Carol Pizza, which is topped with Figs, Pistachio, Gorgonzola Cheese, Duck Confit and finished with Honey. The idea might be alarming to some but I'm telling you this Pizza works and I will definitely be back for more of the Carol and some others."}
{"text":"I was excited when this restaurant opened in the neighbourhood. My bf and I had such a pleasant experience. The place is spacious with a bar separate from a dining area. You can see the oven when you step in. It's a trendy place with modern decor. Our server was friendly, food came out quickly (perfect time gap between the app and the pizza), and most importantly the pizza and bruschetta were delicious! Crispy toasts were rubbed with a generous amount garlic and topped with fresh ingredients. Both dishes are reasonably priced too. We had three slices of pizza to take home because portions were big.   Overall, I am glad they opened it in my neighbourhood. It's a great place where you can have not-so-casual/fancy lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"We checked out this place after seeing images on instagram, and I must say the place was great! we ordered a pizza and spaghetti and meatballs, both were very large portions and tasted excellent! We also got a Cesar salad, which was average, but its hard finding a really really good pizza Cesar salad. For dessert we got the apple crumble, which I wouldnt recommend, it wasn't that great.   The service was great, very attentive and friendly staff. They also had a discount on wine bottles.   I would recommend anyone coming here for great Italian food. They also do takeout as well"}
{"text":"This review would've been a 1 or a 2 star review if their food didn't redeem them. I was looking for a nice Friday evening dinner spot and decided that I would check out Angelos since there were such great reviews on Yelp and in the neighbourhood. When we arrived, it was quite busy but got seated at a nice spot by the window. We got served waters right away but here is where it begins to go downhill.   We're sitting there waiting for someone to bring us a menu and no one notices our existence for over 10 mins. So I had to flag the hostess down to give us some menus. She was very apologetic and kind about it and I saw that she tried to flag a server down but more guests were coming and she had to seat them. Finally another 10 mins go by, our server notices us because she was serving pizza to another table. She takes our drinks order, app and pizza order which we said was okay for the app to come first and then the pizza. The wine we ordered, I asked for way more than what was served. I kindly asked the bartender and he apologized and topped it right up for us. The app took longer than usual but I was sympathetic because it was a busy night.   The chicken wings were good. Pretty overkill with the caramelized onions but I thought it was a solid dish. My friend pointed out that typically he wouldn't order wings at an Italian restaurant but it was solid. We waited quite a long time for the pizza after so I wish we asked for the app and pizza at the same time. When it finally came, they apologized that it took long because it was a \"busy night\". I'm sorry but restaurants need to manage the demand if they want to be successful. Being busy should not be an excuse.   After we were done we had to flag down our server again for the bill. That at least, came quickly. She again apologized and said sorry the food took so long, it's a really crazy busy night. I'm happy for the restaurants success but again, should not be an excuse.   Angelos has great potential. I felt the food was tasty. The service (and maybe hiring of more staff) needs to be improved. I think next time I would grab take out instead."}
{"text":"This place does the job if you're hungry and can't get in anywhere on a Saturday night in Toronto but it's definitely not been a consistent experience the 3 times I've been here unfortunately.   To start: I would not recommend getting their desserts. I am a foody and my friend and I try new restaurants all over the city including Italian (being Italian myself) and we had to return both of our desserts. This is something we never do! We ordered the Budino as this is something I always get at Terroni. It was covered with salt to the point it was inedible. We got our waiter to try it and he also agreed it wasn't edible. So we thought we can go wrong with the tiramisu so we got that instead. The second my friend tried it he grabbed his napkin to spit it out. I immediately tried it to see what was wrong and I did the exact same thing. It tasted like rotten egg yolk! The waiter came over to see how the tiramisu was and we felt so bad having to tell him it was disgusting and had him try this one as well. Again, he agreed it was inedible.   What was really unfortunate after spending $200 there (bottle of wine, pizza, pasta and 2 apps) he said the dessert chef said we had to pay for one of the two desserts even though we didn't eat other otherwise he would get in trouble. I couldn't believe that and am very disappointed the restaurant operated that way.   Lastly, the two times I ordered the same pasta dish for Take out the portion size was cut in half in comparison for what it is if you dine in paying the same price. It's a bit sneaky to do that because you don't see your portion size until you get home. The portion size shouldn't change for dine in or take out if the prizes doesn't change.   Advice to restaurant: if you want to have repeated clients (like I am to the Terroni's, Buca's, Dimmi's, Cibo's etc) be genuine and real. If your dessert chef isn't good, maybe look for another one than serving inedible items and expecting guests to pay for it even though they don't eat It. Also, an antipasto platter (which is a staple item at almost every Italian restaurant) would be a great thing to add to your menu.  Most restaurants also bring bread complimentary to the table, unsure why you make your guests pay for it.   Sometimes going the extra mile with the little things will ensure you get repeated guests and referrals. Unfortunately I haven't had the greatest experiences at your restaurant."}
