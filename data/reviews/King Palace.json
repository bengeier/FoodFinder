{"text":"The dishes are mediocre, but nothing is served fresh - everything is taken from a buffet and microwaved on demand. There is better Indian food to be found within only a few blocks. Also they will charge you for a 'combo' regardless of what you order. Skip it."}
{"text":"I remember reading about this place a few years ago and we were driving by, I needed water and so we stopped and I ran in. I saw the line up of amazing looking foods! I ran out, grabbed boyfriend and we went in and ordered food! I had a combo with the butter chicken and I think tikka masala (can't remember) now. Everything was great and the meal included naan! Know that you're eating in a fast foody feeling environment, next to a car wash, where you're surrounded by taxi drivers (who clearly know their food). Don't come here for a romantic dinner, come for the great food! Prices are pretty good as well! It's a quick walk from Yonge & Bloor or Bloor & Church streets! Great for late nights - they're open from 11 a.m. to 6 a.m! Mmmm..am hungry thinking about it!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Very delicious food with very great service. Some of the best Indian food I have found in Toronto!! I would do take out though, not a lot of seating and it seems to be where cab drivers hang out."}
{"text":"Awesome food, you just have to think of it as not your traditional restaurant.  I think of it as a place to get some great ready-made indian that I need to heat up when I get home (on a plate).  A good amount of spice, plenty of flavour.  I unfortunately don't remember exactly what I ordered, but everything was great.    You get a high end restaurant flavour at street prices.  On top of that, I've never noticed it closed.  Great for a post outing dinner.  I ignored the combos and just pointed, they figured it out for me and it was a decent price.  I will definitely go back.  My only critique would be the naan.  Sure it was good, but I would give this place 5 stars if it was like the naan at higher end places - super fluffy and with irregular puffs.  I agree with with most people that bringing it home and heating it up yourself is the way to go.  Also try to get them to put your separate items in their own containers, something about being human where you want your dishes on their own."}
{"text":"Terrible food. I don't know how to describe this food it was super sweet. Not Pakistani food that I love. None of the stuff has taste and it was bad tasting and not authentic. And the worst thing of all, is that none of the food is fresh and because all the food is cooked in the microwave. It was just plain terrible and you should never ever waste your money here."}
{"text":"SPICY Food! Tried the Kashmiri Chicken Combo. Came with Salad (without dressing), and (soft) Naan, plus a Coke. I don't know why there was no dressing on the salad (maybe the greens where meant to be put on the bread with the chicken?!) The soft Naan was really good, and the chicken pretty hot.  Fast and friendly service, the price was great (13$), and they are open all night! The interior is \"Take-Out\"-friendly but nothing more. The counter looks great with all the different dishes. At least 30 of them (ready cooked), so I understand why they have to microwave them - always the same problem if a diner offers too many things..."}
{"text":"Got the butter chicken with nan A lot of variety, butter chicken was not bad but Ive had better before They warm up the food and give a small salad, 2 pieces of naan with a drink for 13 The best part of the meal was the naan, it was large and soft Would visit again"}
{"text":"Let's be real for a second. This place is open everyday, from 11 am to 6 am and always has at least 30+ dishes. It is not going to be fresh and microwaving will be a reality of the operation. Because the food sits for a long time, the oil will float to the top this does not mean the dish has more oil than usual, you just don't see it in other places.  The food itself is ok. It is not great, but not terrible either. And they don't try and charge you more than it's worth either. There's a reason you see cabbies eating here, the food offers a god a value and tastes good enough.   Also, I wouldn't recommend eating there. Get take out, eat it at home."}
{"text":"5 stars purely because of the cult power and following of this place. Its an institution, most of the food is good but steer clear of any of the curries which are too oily because they may not be fresh. Opt for anything that is cream based (such as the butter of Kashmiri chicken). It's also a great place to hang out for some Chai and Pakoras or Samosas which are quite delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great friendly service, have been coming for over ten years.   Great value, ordering 3-veggie combo sometimes with fresh roti, sometimes with rice.  Free, ample parking.  ** Bread made fresh to order!! **"}
{"text":"I live somewhat nearby and I have been a loyal customer for years. The food is amazing here, and you can't beat the service hours, especially if you are a night owl like I am.  The ambience in this place is terrible, so if you are taking to go it's worthwhile to tell them you'd like it cold. Otherwise you will watch them microwave your food in the styrofoam take out box. Best to heat it at home.  That aside, the actual food is unbeatable and decently priced. Definitely suggest trying the garlic naan, mango lassi, and really..everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Great variety to chose from and they are very flexible in terms of being able to pick up to 3 meats when ordering. Service was quick, maybe because it was not busy when i was there. Store is relatively clean but the furniture is a bit old. Food was decent but very oily. They are open quite late for those who have late night cravings for curry. I would give it a 3 star but give one more star because of the variety you get to pick from."}
{"text":"Three stars for now, and I want to go back a second time as I think it has potential.  Since I don't like spicy hot (but never give up on it) I asked for something not spicy and they gave me a dish that was extremely hot and I ate only a small amount of it.  I found out later that Butter Chicken would have been a better bet, so maybe that will be worth a try.  I didn't like the salad, it was a bit of lettuce and cucumbers and a couple of carrots with a watery dressing.  The naan was excellent and plentiful so I did not go away hungry.  Couldn't stop eating it.  Service was friendly and helpful.  Interesting to watch the guys behind the counter walking aimlessly around in circles but getting it done. It's a few weeks ago and I can't remember if the cutlery was real or plastic.  They would lose a star for plastic and/or paper plates.  I think they used a combination of paper and real plates, again not sure.  They heat up the food in the microwave but I tried to ignore that.  The food on display was impressive and very attractively displayed, I just wish I could eat some of it without my mouth being on fire.  In case you've never been there, it is a long steam table with many items.  Unpretentious and comfortable.  Very clean though I did not see the washrooms.  Back I go one of these days for another try, there has to be something there for me."}
{"text":"A great place to indulge in Halal Indian and Pakistani cuisine. They freshly bake the Naan on premises with different toppings if ordered. Actually , the Naan is the only item along with the Kebobs that are not nuked up. Everything on display is heavily microwaved for re-heating purposes and at times the food sits too long on their shelves. If you crave beautiful Hindi music and dance videos , their TV will play the selections for you multiple times. Most are their dishes either vegetarian or meat dishes are nicely spiced and pretty decent. It's a hangout place for our hard working taxi drivers, an indication of clean and decent food."}
{"text":"Food at Kings palace is ...Unhygienic, Greasy, Stale, preservatives...  For god sake...all the people giving good reviews..please get a life. May be you guys never had a good food in your life or may be never went to a good place. All it is a microwave food...it is not fresh at all..!!! The food has too much color and very oily too. The taste might be good but that food is extremely unhealthy, Any Toronto food inspectors reading ? I am totally aghast how can people like this place. There is also a strange smell in the hall as well.. like puke...and i guess the curry prepared is used for 3-4 days. The food is not fresh and just the re-heated in microwave. The food may look good but it has got lots of preservatives and eating soda and color. If you care for your self then stay way from this place...worst restaurant ever in Toronto...!!! The owner Mr Butt...is only trying make big margin on his sales without caring about the quality..!! there are many other good paki restaurants in Toronto to eat..!! I will never eat at this place in my life..."}
{"text":"This is definitely the first and last time going there. I had the butter chicken and rice and despite the guy warming it up in the microwave (first red flag of NON FRESH FOOD and poor restaurant management) I could still taste the staleness of the rice which must've been at least 5-6 days old. I figured a good butter chicken sauce would still be salvageable with a couple naans but NOPE. It tasted mediocre, and as a foodie, I did not enjoy any of it, not one bit. Indian Pakistani food is otherwise my favourite and I hate wasting food but I threw the 11$ (overpriced) box of food after a few spoons in.   The 11$ is supposed to include salad and pop per the signs plastered all over their menu, but I got neither. I guess not looking like an Indian/Pakistani person they thought they could pull one over on me.   I would neither ever recommend this place, or go there myself. If I wanted leftovers from last week to be warmed in a microwave, I wouldn't pay 11$.  HORRIBLE FOOD."}
{"text":"Horrendous. Better to go hungry and save your money. You know that sound they use on Kitchen Nightmares when they open the fridge and the food is all rotten and there are roaches everywhere? That is the sound you should hear in your head when you walk in the door.  They use a microwave, for Vishnu's sake!  Avoid."}
{"text":"Too much color, no taste and not fresh food. They actually microwave what you order. I think its definitely not the place to have Indian or Pakistani food. The only plus is that its open till late night."}
{"text":"decent food resonable priced nd much more verity. chicken biryani is awesome. if u lyk spicy thing so then you go with chicken tikka massala .loved this place all the time"}
{"text":"Horrible food, cold,  and overpriced. Avoid and try a different restaurant."}
{"text":"My go-to place for 4am Pakistani/Indian cuisine. They're open very late and usually have a collection of cab drivers parked outside who are always fun to chat with. The atmosphere inside is very casual, with an \"order at the counter\" and \"seat yourself\" system and TVs that usually play Bollywood music videos with occasional news reports.   Our dishes of choice: palak paneer, tika masala, butter chicken and chicken korma with plain rice and naan."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh yeahhhh!! Now THIS is the real deal, none of that artificial stuff you get at other places (New York Fries Butter Chicken anyone?) I came here with a rather large group, probably about 15 of us? Yeah, we couldn't all sit down but nobody cared because the food was just mmm mmm good. The service was quick and friendly, and the place was small but cozy. The place kind of has a Chinese Fast Food Restaurant feel to it, except with much yummier food.  The nahn bread was huge!  The butter chicken was delish, and they even had those orange thingies.... the super sweet desserts that kind of look like little funnel cakes, THAT got me excited, not because of the sugar high, but because they're not that easy to find in Toronto if you don't know where to look, and especially if you don't know what they're called. I always called it \"that-super-sweet-swiggly-orange-thing-that-tastes-like-honey!\" I got my first taste at my Indian friend's wedding (home-cooked indian food ftw) and have been hooked ever since. I also like that you can actually see your food before they scoop it on to your plate."}
{"text":"I am not sure if he is the owner or the Manager; a particularly odious, uncouth, ill mannered and uncultured character. I have seen him curse and kind of abuse an employee in his native Punjabi. The other night I was there to buy some take-out stuff and while I am waiting to pay, he asks the cashier in Urdu; has the old guy (baba in urdu) been served? I guess some of these guys, doesn't matter how long they live in a civilised country, just can't rid themselves of their crudeness and incivility. You'll never hear in any Canadian food outlet, a customer being referred to as this old guy or this old woman. I won't be visiting this place ever again."}
{"text":"I have yet to taste better pakistani food in my life!  Lahore Tikka House is good, Ghandi Roti tasty but neither comes even close to the flavours served up at King Palace.  Give the ginger chicken a try (packs a punch of heat and complex flavor), bhaji kashmiri and and any of the curries.  We tend to order the 3 veg on rice and 3 meat with naan to go (both come with salad, yogurt dressing on the side and drink) and there is sooo much left over between 2 people even eating like complete pigs.    It usually comes out to around 20$, insane!  I am in love!  If you are eating in it's pretty no frills, more of a cafeteria style setting.  Parking out front and easy to walk to from bloor and yonge.  Make sure to get a plastic bag, that reddish oil seeping out of the containers is hell to get out of anything if it spills."}
{"text":"So tasty. So unhealthy.  A guilty pleasure if you like South Asian food.  Yummy naan, good paneer, all dishes we tried made for a flavourful fast-food experience.   Great for take-out or grabbing a quick lunch."}
{"text":"As a Pakistani born in Canada who misses home cooked meals I come to King Palace when I need a fix of south asian food. I am very selective in what I order. My first experience with the rice was not as good as my experience with their naan. I very much recommend the naan over the rice. My favorite dishes are the haleem, channa, and butter chicken. The daal looks good too but I have never tried it. The people behind the counter of course let you try anything if you are unsure of the taste or want to see if something is spicy enough. I know the idea of them popping it in the microwave bothers some but I always get mine to go and enjoy it at home. Many South Asians come here. As the reviews state many cab drivers come and let me tell you cab drivers wives usually cook AMAZING dishes so if they come the food has to be decent. I know it definitely cannot beat real home cooked south asian meals but it definitely satisfies my cravings when I can't get fresh cooked food."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Everything about it is dirty. I must have been wasted the last 5 times I went, but this time I realized how bad it really is. The food is extremely salty, I can't imagine people cooking like this in Pakistan, they would all be terminally ill from high blood pressure. The restaurant (if you can call it that) keep the tandoori chicken, kebobs and a few other meat dishes out of the fridge, I can't understand how they passed health inspection from doing this. The naan seems like it comes out of a bag when you go late at night (3am). The tandoori chicken tasted sour, like the yogurt went bad after being left out. How do they not know proper food handling basics? The washroom looks like it came right out of the slums, you need to disinfect your hands after washing them in there, eww. Someone please open a clean pakistani restaurant, please."}
{"text":"The food is okay. Nothing too great. But I liked their fruit cream. Unfortunately, the fruit cream i got for myself today was stale and literally smelled of curd. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Few years ago, this place was great.  Now, I'm disappointed.  Went last week and had the Chili Chicken with rice.  It was very greasy and didn't taste very good.  They put the food in the microwave.  Came out 1/2 hot and 1/2 cold.  There is much better out there."}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES Some of the best Indian/Pakistani food in the city. How do I know? Cabbies. All the time. Honestly, who would know better than the cabbies? Also 24 HOURS!!!  MENU RECOMMENDATIONS You absolutely cannot go wrong with the Butter Chicken. Creamy, tasty sauce and huge chunks of succulent chicken over rice. I finally tried the Mango Chicken and that was similarly delicious. And for those who prefer more \"authentic\" indian, there's loads of options. Basically there's a plethora of catering trays filled with meat and veggie options - probably 20+ different options. They've let us just take a container and mix and match until it's filled as well. As for the nan, they recently changed it and I really don't like what they've got now. Disappointing.  SERVICE NOTES There is one counter and usually 1-2 people people ready to take your order/fill your container and these guys don't exactly move fast. Once your Styrofoam container is ready they'll offer to heat it in the microwave. It's basically as sketchy as it sounds. If you're on your way home, just take it cold and heat it up yourself...on a plate.  LOCATION NOTES Located on Church, just north of Bloor on the south side across from my friend Neil's place. Just look for the cabs. Seriously. Parking in a small lot right at the front of the building.  HUMOUROUS STORY My friend Chicken Parm Phil uses Cetaphil because his name is Phil."}
{"text":"Food ***** Amazing flavours, selection, always fresh. Great place to test your spice meter. The salad looks lack lustre but save it for last, the creamy dressing does help if it gets too spicy. At first sight I was disappointed to see all the microwaves, but that's just the fastest way about it. The food doesn't need that much reheating. We tried just ordering take out and reheating at home-didn't need long at all, the meat was still super moist.  Atmosphere ** More of just a take out place, but if you can snag a spot to enjoy your naan hot and crispy then definitely do.  Service **** Attentive and friendly. With so many curries to choose from they were patient with me and my questions.  $** Great price for a solid meal, especially on super cold winter days."}
{"text":"food is okay. I doubt the hygiene and freshness of the food.i eat because parking is easy between jobs. i used to tolerate the stale smell of food but it has become worst in the last two visits. today the chili chicken and mix vegetables were rancid and sour. not going to stop here again."}
{"text":"Worst Indian place ever. Avoid at all cost.   $47 for 2 dish and all I got was microwaved food with shitty cashier attitude"}
{"text":"Very good Indian food. Friends and I stop here after a night on the town. Open very late. One thing I would say to the owners: I realize there are cramped quarters behind the counter but train your staff to wash their hands after cleaning off dirty trays and before serving the next meal. Lots of veggie and meat options"}
{"text":"Food is overpriced. For what it costs this isn't a good bang for your buck. Under $10 you basically get rice aka chicken biryani. Umm what chicken? After inquiring about it, guy looks guilty. I felt gypped.  For some reason, after paying, they ask you if you want salad or pop when it's already included in the combo. Confusing and sneaky. Not sure how long the food sits there for, as they microwave it. Get this... in styrofoam containers!! Cash only, machine is broken."}
{"text":"If you need a cab or late-night Pakistani/Indian food, then head on down to King's Palace.  Their donut-shop-like neon sign acts like a beacon in the night on Church Street, here you can find over 44 combos (veggie dishes, boneless meat options, and other).  I couldn't decide on what kind of chicken I wanted, so I ordered: *Combo #33 - Three boneless chicken combo  ($11.99) (comes with two naan, salad, and pop) * Palak paneer ($7 bucks)  They heat up of all the food in the microwave.    The microwaving part doesn't bother me... but the heating food up in Styrofoam does.  I'll still eat here, don't get me wrong, I just pretend I don't see it.    When you get your food take-out, keep in mind that the order of chicken is half sauce, which leaks out of the container they give you.  As for the food...  The naan was a pleasant surprise! Even after I had walked home, it was still really hot. Crispy with little charred bits, chewy and soft on the inside, and gigantic.  The chicken was tender and soft and only one piece of boned chicken snuck in.  The meat is smothered in sauce and oodles of oil.  Butter chicken was decent...sweet, creamy, and very mild. The curry chicken wasn't particularly spicy, but not bad..  The Chicken Kasmiri was super flavourful, but I can't say it was my favourite of the three.  The palak paneer was very earthy and citrusy.  There weren't very many pieces of paneer. I think I will go for a lentil dish instead next time.  There's something about this place that keeps you coming back! Greasy, convenient, and cheap."}
{"text":"Great family run joint with a regular truck driver following. Seems to open til 4am and it's the only spicy option in that area of yorkville besides pizzas. It's a deli of Pakistani food that can be kind of greasy. The combos can get confusing--just expect to spend 10-15 on an entree in the end. Each dish comes with 2 naan or a rice. And yes, it's a deli. They microwave to reheat the food. It's not made to order, but you get what you pay for and the portions are alright."}
{"text":"Don't do it! Having been lured by the good reviews at King Palace, I decided to give it a try. Big mistake!  The food was from the buffet and heated up in the microwave which is a big red flag for me. It was quite bland and lacked flavour in my opinion, and I didn't finish the majority of my meal.  Although this restaurant seems to be always busy, I won't be back in a hurry."}
{"text":"Indian/Pakistani food at it's best.  I knew this place was good when the Taxi drivers were all there at 4 AM.  24-hour service is a big plus.  Since then it has become my go-to place for Pakistani/Indian food.  The combos are plentiful, the options are many and the service is always very friendly and helpful if you are not sure what the dishes are.  I've ordered a-la carte and prices tend to be high - so stay with the combos and order a different one for everybody in your crew and then share to get a taste of everything.  Amazing.  I go back monthly."}
{"text":"I tend to get hungry at the most inconvenient hours.  King Palace is my hero!  There is so much selection I am always overwhelmed.  I also find their portion sizes gigantic.  I highly recommend their garlic naan and the lamb curry.  The rice is also delicious, as are any of the meat curries.  I have also tried some vegetarian dishes and have not been disappointed.  I'm not sure you can go wrong here!  Although there are a few tables, I have never dined in.  Partly because I come to King Palace at odd hours and partly because the ambience isn't 5-star.  The portions are so big that it usually lasts me a couple of days.  This food miraculously tastes delicious no matter how many times you reheat it.  (Caution: the naan is best consumed fresh.)  When you're angry at the world that every other kitchen has closed, don't forget about King Palace!"}
{"text":"Food tasted okay and lots of choices in food. Price was bit expensive and the food was cold so not sure how long it was sitting out.   Credit card machine was not working :( when I went in.. Cash only..."}
{"text":"i go to this place all the time. i really like. its open 24/7 and the food is always reasonably fresh and the service is not bad.  i usually get the chicken biryani, which is a great late night snack for me. most of there meat dishes are quite good and they have an extensive vegetarian/ vegan selection.  what you get for your money at this place is great."}
{"text":"The food is good, spicy but a bit too oily for my taste. I liked their kebab and the chicken curries. Perfect place to order in from at 3 am!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. You get your money's worth of food and it's fast and delicious. Best butter chicken in  downtown core in my book."}
{"text":"same review as some previous authors, food microwaived took it to go to have lunch ata park opened it it was stone cold, average taste , not worth 11 bucks."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place for all hours Pakistani food and was frequented by many taxi drivers who needed delicious food to keep them on the road. Centrally located behind Toronto Reference, it was a go-to spot for me in my first years in Toronto.   Sadly , the indomitable Mr Butt has left for a new place at Sherbourne and Dundas and the food at King Palace has taken a dive. The Buttee chicken and the aloo gobi were decidedly meh and the place was in a state of disrepair. Also there were no cabbies to be seen."}
{"text":"This is my regular go-to with my bros, because it's the only place we can all agree on when we get together for some grub.   Don't expect a fine dining experience, the atmosphere (especially at night) is definitely not first-date material...but the food is good, the options are plenty.   It's not cheap or very quick, considering the food is ready and out, I'd say average prices for a Pakistani/Indian restaurant. But, getting a good, genuine desi food experience downtown, though it's becoming more available, still, this place does it right.   There are always people there, any time of night, and there's usually some Bollywood film playing in the background. It's a very no-fuss kind of place, and I always leave completely stuffed and satiated.   I see this place being on my regular-visit list for a long time."}
{"text":"Late night- Street meat, Mcdonalds, Deli food ....hmmm...OH how about KING PALACE!!!   less then $15 you get yourself a three meat combo and they have such a large selection. Items are very spicy , which i love and at this time of the night when there are no other options. AMAZING!  Everybody that i have brought here have loved this place. The butter chicken is amazing, but has gotten more and more sweeter over the years. That is why I always get the chicken tikka masala as well.  I think that there may have been a change in ownership and the original owners opened up a place called King Place. I have not been there as of yet, i think that is on my TO do list."}
{"text":"RIP OFF!!!!! Rice and butter chicken for $28. And I only got 4 pieces of chicken. Not worth it. Although the food is decent, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Horrible customer service, it's disappointing."}
{"text":"I was here once and never ever did I want to go back. I seriously do not know why so many people like this place.  Half my co-workers hate it (Indian/Pakistanian and non-Indian-Pakistanian) and the other half love it.    So keep in mind, I am coming here sober expecting a good lunch.  I ordered one of their combos, which included a couple types of chicken and some naan bread.  It looked good on the counter.    However, then they put it on a plate and nuke it.  WTF?  Shouldn't the steam tables be working to keep the food hot? This immediately made me lose my appetite. Food could have been sitting there for over 24 hours for all I know!!!    I still go with it and then when I see it, all i see is one plate of rice with a mix of gravy.  I'm still hopeful though.  I go through all the food, and there is barely any meat! It's all oil and sauce.   So we get the naan and at least I have oil to dip it in (even though I only expect to dip bread into oil(olive) in an Italian restaurant).  The naan was pretty good.    So while I'm eating, I turn to the window and see how dirty the window sill is and I see flies and a few ants and am immediately grossed out.  Tried my best to finish it as I hate wasting food, but this food was just plain nasty (so I'm sure this is a great place when you are drunk).  I really wish I could give this place at least 2 stars as I hate giving one star reviews, but I was turned off Indian food for close to 1 year because of this bad experience.    Sorry."}
{"text":"I passed here many times, but never really gave it a chance until Saturday, July 5 after exiting the car adjacent car wash where my friend was getting his car washed. Entered the place and I was greeted by the cashier who made me feel right at home. Great selection of traditional Pakistani/Indian plates at your disposition, I ordered two Butter Chicken specials to go and was extremely pleased with the serving size, price, and taste.  Regardless of all the negative reviews on here (they're more like whiners than diners), I will definitely will be coming here more to try out more selections in the near future."}
{"text":"This place has 6 MICROWAVES. The food just sits out there cold, and they microwave your food right in front of you. How they have any customers at all is beyond me."}
{"text":"Decent food reasonably priced for the working man. Very greasy food. Not the bat customer service"}
{"text":"LOVE their butter chicken. The staff is super friendly and so kind. Plus the price for so much food, 2 naans (fresh baked!) included + drink + salad for $13. The place however could use a deep cleaning."}
{"text":"Had Butter chicken with rice there yesterday. The food was not fresh. Extremely overpriced for the quality. They should probably cut the prices in half there, because the service/food is not worth it."}
{"text":"Kings Palace was recommended to me by an Indian new comer (a few years ago) to the city as the closest thing to real, home cooked Indian food. Don't come expecting a nice sit down restaurant. There are places to sit but the ambience is lacking. On a regular day they will have loud Indian music video's or news blaring in the backround on the large television screen . But, the staff are friendly and bring your food to the table. This is a fast food joint that will have your taste buds longing for more. You will always see at least one cabby parked outside which I think is a sign to how good it is. The food is layed out behind a glass counter and you pick what you want to eat. They have combo's and the portions are large. I always opt for a vegetarian item (cheaper than the meat items) but am never sure what I am eating exactly (there are no names on the food items). I just know it tastes good. The nann is large, fluffy and buttery. Perfect to scoop with. I highly recommend you take a chance with this place even if the interior has you second guessing.  Note: Different Address to what Yelp has (it changed locations):  820 Church Street Toronto, ON M4W 2M9  (416) 515-8188"}
{"text":"So I got butter chicken, palak paneer (spinach and Indian cottage cheese) and chhole chicken.  Let me start by saying that the choice they have is enormous. Butter chicken was so sweet that I couldn't eat it. Butter chicken is from India, and the original recipe doesn't have any sweetness. I don't know who came up with the idea.   Palak paneer and chhole were not bad. Naan was mediocre. Service was nothing to write home about. Prices at least 10% higher than what other Indian Pakistani restaurants charge.   So given a choice of rather go to Gerard Street for Pakistani food."}
{"text":"Grimy late-night right here. This place was actually a little bit off putting because its kinda dirty and frankly kind of expensive. They also microwave your food right in front of you... With that said, the food selection here is ridiculously huge and the food is especially tasty at a time of day when there are practically no options besides pizza or burgers. At 14 bucks for two curries and one rice option as well as a drink and naan bread. The portion is massive and probably is a good idea to split with another friend"}
{"text":"Big selection, though a bit expensive. The taste is pretty average--I've had better tasting food, but King Palace isn't bland and it's certainly not bad.  Yes, the food is reheated in a microwave, but if it's not hot enough, why wouldn't you ask them to nuke it longer? To the dumbs who made comments about them being in the tables: the tables aren't meant to keep things hot, just to keep them hotter than the temp that allows bacteria to grow. If they constantly kept the food at a temp that would be fine for serving, what do you think this extremely overcooked food would taste like? Do you actually think they are going to make 40 unique dishes to order for 19 hours a day?  Anyway, the first time I ate there was a few weeks ago and it was perfectly fine. The food was properly heated and each meal had a nice taste."}
{"text":"Late night food run.  Unexpectedly a vast variety of dishes to choose from.    I simply asked for the spiciest dish of all and they sure delivered!    The Chicken Tikka Masala was good enough to take home and even eat the next day.  Reheated again, mind you.    Still yummy."}
{"text":"Last night, while the family opted for Pizza Pizza, I sauntered across the street to King Palace.   It is located next to a hand car wash, and surely does not win prizes for ambiance.  They feature a nicely displayed steam table with a wide variety of Indo-Pak specialties, with a wonderful fresh baked nan bread.  I randomly picked a nice chicken dish, a wonderful lentil dal, and the aforesaid nan. The chicken was served on a perfectly cooked rice, nice seasoned and cooked very well.  It took about 3 minutes to be served and walk out with a bag of goodies. I could have saved a few dollars if I had chosen on their combos, but the menu was so extensive that I opted for creating my own.  It is quick, available, good, tasty and millions of cabbies can't be wrong. And for those of you who look for it its Halal."}
{"text":"One of the best place to go for late night food and when you want to have a sumptuous meal! You should definitely go there at least once!  Good:  1. Timing (its open quite late at night - probably up till 4 AM) 2. Variety - I know very few places with such variety of food 3. Ambiance - Makes you feel like you are in either India or Pakistan and eating from a normal restaurant 4. Price - quite cheap  Not so good: 1. Taste - somehow I'm not a big fan of their taste - I'm sure you'd get a lot of other places with better tasting Indian and Pakistani food - but again, it's subjective!"}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food, loved the butter chicken and the fresh naan bread. They are open all night!!  Until 6am"}
{"text":"Ugh... truly the worst. I don't quite understand how they have the accolades or bragging posters on their window.  Yes the food is microwaved. In styrofoam containers, for your carcinogenic enjoyment. I saw 3 cockroaches crawling across the dirty floors which looked like they hadn't been swept or mopped in months.  I had ordered aloo gobi with naan but was so put off by the cockroaches and the two men giggling like school girls behind the counter over a cell phone, I just left.  Blech... don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Dishonest people working over there. The food is too oily I can describe all items as disgusting. No need to visit this garbage.  I did a mistake by visiting this place; be careful and recheck your bill since they charge the wrong prices.  When ask why they will edit and also give you another wrong price. Something stinky in this rubbish restaurant."}
{"text":"One word.. Microwave. If you don't mind all meals zapped; it's fine for you.  Food sits luke warm waiting for radiation heating.  Another word; expensive.  PASS."}
{"text":"The place is dirty, overpriced and they microwave all the food.  The microwaving is done in styrofoam boxes if you're getting takeout... hello cancer!  Took out 4 curries for family dinner... All tasted awful... Only the Naan was good."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for Indian food in Toronto. They're open till 6 in the morning and are a great alternative to a 24 hour Mickeys for those late night cravings. They also have parking right in front of the restaurant and so that headache is taken care of. The food is excellent although some dishes are really oily. All the food including the kebabs is prepepared and heated up in a microwave before being served although i don't think it reduces the taste of the food too much and everything is still pretty delicious. The chicken shahi is one of the extra oily dishes. While it tastes really good, the amount of oil in it is disgusting and makes you feel a bit sick. The chicken tikka masala isn't what you'd expect. Instead of chicken tikkas thrown into a butter chicken like gravy, it has a completely different gravy that is a lot spicier and a bit too harsh for me. The Kashmiri chicken has methi (fenugreek) in it and since i hate anything thats green, this is my least favorite dish on the menu. I usually get the butter chicken though which i really love. It is still really heavy but tastes really good and doesn't seem to have the floating oil problem that a lot of the other dishes have. They also have a lot of dishes that most places don't have on their menu like haleem and even brain masala which is exactly what you think it is. I did get the mango lassi once but wouldn't recommend it. It wasn't thick like its supposed to be and was a bit of a waste tbh. Overall though i have never left kings palace unsatisfied and i believe almost everything on the menu is really good. Kings palace also seems to be pretty popular with the cabbies of Toronto and there are usually a couple of cabs parked outside. Their food is priced really well and so maybe that is a factor in involved. The combo system seems like the way to go with 2 naans, a drink and a salad along with your food coming up to about 12 bucks. They also have an option to have three dishes instead of one for the same price which seems like a really good deal except they're all still put into the same bowl and so by the end of it you're eating something that has a little bit of the other two dishes in it as well. My only complaint with kings palace is the bathrooms which are absolutely filthy and unfortunately a must to wash your hands after the butter chicken. I usually try to sneak into the ladies washroom which is a bit cleaner for some reason. Overall a great place and definitely a better bet than lahore tikka house which i never liked to begin with."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by walking on the street and looking for a sushi shop close to WeWork on Bloor. I thought to myself why not try this. Food was good and the price was right. I had the mango chicken and the butter chicken with rice. A bit cold at first, the waitress gladly reheated it to my satisfaction. If your looking for something cheap with a good portion this is a great place to go to. on par with some great Indian restaurants. Enjoy, I know i did late at night."}
{"text":"The poor reviews of this restaurant are made by people who don't know their south Asian food. This stuff is fantastic Pakistani food with tons of spice and even more flavour.   I love rice but freshly made pita/naan is a must. For $10-$15 you get a generous portion of curry, 2 dinner plate sized naan, a side salad and a drink. Not as super cheap as you might expect a greasy spoon place to be but definitely still good value for money.   I docked a point here because all the food is microwaved and it can be a little greasy  but too be honest,growing up in a Bengali immigrant family. All the food I ate was microwaved, spicy and a little greasy. So I guess it almost feels like home. That probably explains the tons of authentic south Asian clientele."}
{"text":"Try the brain curry! Everything is good though and definitely well priced. My go to late-night spot!"}
{"text":"The down and dirty greasy spoon of Pakistani food, this place is popular with the taxi drivers, likely for it's drive up and take-out style (there is some seating)  Dozens upon dozens of dishes to choose from, and the food is OK, good enough for a late night Indian food fix at least.  But honestly, it's not spectacular, so I'm not sure why there are so many 5-star ratings. I assume it's because the sight of the large selection of food is overwhelmingly exciting, either that or they're just a bunch of wankers showing their lack of experience. Regardless, still recommended.  The only thing that really irks me every time I eat there is they insist on microwaving everything in the takeout Styrofoam containers they use. I like to get it cold and take home for warming.  Worst saag paneer I've ever had! Very very good, and delicious Naan. Need more Naan! Mango chicken is tasty, not greasy. Perfect for the reluctant ones. Lamb and beef were chewy. Not recommended. Curry is good. Daal is good. Butter chicken is ok.  Make sure you order as a combo, it comes with everything you need. Things get a little pricey if you start trying to order pieces of things separately."}
{"text":"This place is literally right around the corner from my office and I drive past it almost every day. My curiosity finally got the better of me and the weather was nice enough for a nice walk.  Their counter is one big display case, running almost the length of the restaurant, and showcasing all the cooked food in pans, kinda like a buffet but not self serve. The wall behind the counter was covered with signs highlighting all the combo meals that they offered.  After surveying the food and avoiding a few dishes that looked really oily, I chose the Butter Chicken combo with basmati rice, salad, and pop. The proprietor (who remained mostly silent during my entire stay) plated the food and put it in a microwave oven on the back counter. What??? That's when I noticed there were six microwave ovens back there. Huh? What's going on here? That triggered something in me to touch the glass of the showcase. It was neither hot nor cold. Room temperature? Should I be concerned about food safety? I had assumed, by appearance, that it was a steam table. Wrong!  While I was eating (I wasn't offered a takeout option), a few customers came in to order takeout. Their meals were put in foam containers and heated in the microwave. While this is not entirely unsafe, not all foam containers are microwave safe and it also depends on the temperature that the contents are being heated to. Hmmm, I think dining-in may have been the safer option.  As far as the food goes, it was fairly bland, and the butter chicken sauce was very runny, nothing like the rich flavour and consistency that I'm used to. At 13.50, it also wasn't cheap. I've been to less expensive all-you-can-eat buffets with far better tasting Indian and Pakistani food.  Unfortunately, with its bland food, lack of customer service, poor value, and questionable (in my opinion) food safety, I cannot recommend King Palace.  BTW, my plate could have used another two minutes in the microwave."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good. My bf and I work late so we used to come in at 12 am and get one biryani, half & half of the meat dishes, 2 naans & 2 drinks - for the price of $24. The price has always fluctuated $1-$2 but it's never felt like a rip off until yesterday! We came in for take out and ordered one plate of biryani and one \"large\" take out cup of chili chicken for... $24! When we were asking the lady how much the individual plates were costing, it's like she was making up prices in front of our faces. She said the large cup was $18 and the small cup was $14. That price was just for the chili chicken. And the \"manager\" who decided to ring us up just asked her how much she said they were and decided to ring up that same amount. We thought this price was off because we used to eat here a lot so when we asked him if it came with drinks, he said \"but I didn't charge you a combo\". Seriously? $24 - no naan (cos they were $2 each according to the lady) and no drinks cos it wasn't a combo. What a rip off! Go somewhere else! I think it's now under new management because we haven't seen the guys who used to serve us whom were all incredibly friendly. Now, the people here are cold and rude and throw your trays onto your table like they're bothered you're actually sitting in to eat."}
{"text":"When I cannot go to Moti Mahal on Gerrard Street, I will go here.   Chicken Biryani good, Chicken and Goat Kebobs good, Dessert selection good. They have a huge selection of food. Try it."}
{"text":"The midnight line-up of taxi cabs out front lends this place some credibility as a solid, late night indian place. As a 3AM munchies spot, King Palace certainly takes the cake as number one.  Don't let the 75-item menu board intimidate you. I'm not sure why they've decided to list every imaginable combination of rice, curry, meat and naan bread, but they have. You can just order rice plus a few proteins from their huge, colourful steam table. Cold steam table.  At King Palace, the food is kept at room-temperature on a defunct \"steam\" table and freshly microwaved to order. My chilli chicken, chicken paneer and lamb korma with plain rice was seasoned well. A great melding of spice, tart and sweet. But the nuke gave the food hot spots, cold spots and made the rice soggy. An unexpected side of naan bread was probably the best part, drizzled to the point of pooling with clarified butter; lesson learned, don't get rice next time.  If it's the middle of the night and you want more than poutine or a hot dog, and something more exciting than 24-hour breakfast, this is the place. If it's the middle of the day and you want good Indian, there's many better options.  A laggy YouTube stream of Indian music videos provides the ambience."}
{"text":"I remember reading about this place in NOW magazine years ago and we were driving by, I needed water and so we stopped and I ran in. I saw the line up of amazing looking foods! I ran out, grabbed boyfriend and we went in and ordered food! I had a combo of the butter chicken and I think tikka masala (can't remember) now. Everything was great and the meal included naan! Know that you're eating in a fast foody feeling environment, next to a car wash, where you're surrounded by taxi drivers (who clearly know their food). Don't come here for a romantic dinner, come for the great food! Prices are pretty good as well! Mmmm..am hungry thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Food is tasty, but a bit pricey based on its setup and location.  But more importantly, I got sick eating here half of the times. After last thunder storm in my stomach, I decide to come back no more."}
{"text":"Looks like these guys want to just have your money.  Placed a order by uber eats for biryani meal and butter chicken meal with butter naan. Got only biryani and butter chicken . No raita no naan no mint sauce.  How do a person eats butter chicken without naan at 3:30 am . Not even a single tissue with food . Got refund for just a naan by uber. Customer care is rude"}
{"text":"Primarily Pakistani in nature, with a TV showing newscasts in Urdu (I think it was Urdu).  Food is served from a steam table, but is very good quality and looks great.  We were not in a curry dish mood the late evening we stopped, so both of us ordered tandoori chicken.  The \"half\" chicken was actually two legs, but they were well seasoned and very well marinated so that the flavour penetrated.    We also had a side order of plain jeera pulao which was good.  Salads that come with the combos are noting special but not bad.  Naan is good and very generous.  This is a joint with no atmosphere to speak of but very friendly and a good place for late night service.  For such a little place, the selection is enormous.  All meat served is halal, too."}
{"text":"this is always a great place to eat either late night or when pressed for time. I always found the non-vegetarian food to be consistently well made with the right amount of spice. vegetarians might not like this restaurant as much, i find that the veggie dishes are hit or miss. The naan is quite good , made the traditional way (no eggs / yeast) menu recommendations: butter chicken, rogan josh, chicken kashmiri, brain masala (unfortunately only on weekends)  I usually end up paying around 13$ with naan and drink."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this taxi stop while geocaching around the Toronto Reference Library.  I've had a bad run with Indian fast food anywhere outside Little India, so I was pleasantly surprised when I dug into the saag paneer and naan!  Cheap, fast and lots of options.   Nothing gormet about King Palace, so not likely I'd stop here again unless I'm looking to fill up quick."}
{"text":"I am seriously dissapointed with the level of service/quality here. As a Pakistani, it is just difficult to find Pakistani places which maintain their quality.  And it is so overpriced!"}
{"text":"- Last resort if you want a hole in the wall Indian spot at 3a.m - Order only items that are prepared fresh (naan, paratha etc.) - Friendly staff, service is quick. The only positive about the place unfortunately. - A lot of variety yet almost all items taste similar - Microwaved food is usually terrible - Pricey considering the quality. Around $12-$18 per person."}
{"text":"The taste of the food is good but  there was more bones then meat in the lamb curry. A little bit expensive for microwaved  food. Fair prices if it was a sit down type restaurant."}
{"text":"Not bad for fast food take out in Toronto.  True to the Pakistani origin, and flavourful.  It's a bit pricey, but it's in Toronto, so I consider it reasonable without having to drive out to Scarborough or Brampton.  Food is microwaved to reheat, but it's all premade, most Indian/Pakistani food is better the next day anyways, akin to cold pizza, you like it or you don't. I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This place serves great food! Don't forget to try NANs.   So many options, quick service. Very friendly staff. I go there every-time I go to Toronto. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Such a great place to grab some food off of, late night. Price is alright but the food quality & quantity is amazing. This has to be my top indian/pakistani place to eat. Seating capacity inside is about 20 people. The service of the staff is very friendly and great. Parking is kind of tight but it works. Will be going here sometime this week!"}
{"text":"when i see a bunch of microwaves behind the counter, i get apprehensive.   i also read a few claims that the king palace isn't really authentic. not being pakistani, i can't speak to this. however, when i visited, the restaurant was full of happy regulars. like with chinese food, you rarely go wrong following chinese people.  i had the kashmiri chicken. it took a while, but it was delicious. but even more delicious was the naan. i loved it. i couldn't finish all the food.  décor screams hole-in-the-wall. service is brusque (at least to me), but efficient."}
{"text":"Finger Licking Grease Haven!! I stumbled upon this place while coming home from work one night. The aroma of spices made me go inside this HOLE IN THE WALL..( take out in full effect)but Boyyyyy was I glad I did.  I ordered 4 veg samosas (they threw in 2 extras), chicken biryani (which was enough to feed 5 and had a lot of chicken pieces in it as oppose to your usual pass me the magnifying glass and let's play \"where's Waldo\" containers), Nihari (beef bone marrow curry), Haleem (minced stew made of lentils and beef), and 3 buttered naans.  First of all, all of the above came to $35 with tax! And it was ALL Finger Licking Good. Can't wait to try other items on their menu during my next cheat night! Yes I cheat with food ;-)"}
{"text":"Positive: Open very late into the night, quick service, not too pricy, filling portions Cons: Food is microwaved and not at all fresh, very oily and unhealthy.  Overall, i still go there from time to time because ultimately food is tasty, and having that kind of food occasionally (once a month) can't do too much harm to me."}
{"text":"Can't say much for the atmosphere but the food is always one of the best places in the city. Could eat here every day! So many options and always so incredibly flavourful. Regular naan is great but go for garlic naan if you're feeling baller."}
{"text":"The food at this place is awesome! The kashmiri chicken is one of my favourite but everything else is just as tasty. For around 10 bucks you get two freshly baked naans and your choice of three dishes plus a small salad and a drink. You need to be very hungry in order to pile all that up. Now that's a good deal bitches!"}
{"text":"One word - wicked!  Yah yah... I know haters will say its not authentic and so on.  Maybe so, but it's the only fast food I would request for my birthday dinner.  I absolutely love the crazy amount of combos all displayed behind the counter!  And the very odd inefficient way the guys behind the counter seem to put together an order is also kind of fascinating to watch.  Seriously, their rice is strangely addictive and I love all their dahl dishes.  People have complained that it's too spicy.  No way!  It's perfect!    Generally I do take out.  It only makes sense because the servings are huge and I end up lugging home a lot of left overs anyway.  The restaurant itself isn't catering towards a fine dining experience... it's totally functional which is just fine if you're stopping by for quick eats.  I have a hard time convincing people to try it out because people are put-off because it used to be attached to a gas station in its previous location and now it's beside a car wash.  This is irrelevant in my opinion.  Decode the combos and you will enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just like the food I had here, I am only lukewarm about King's Palace.  Met a friend for lunch and we both grabbed a combo.  I had the mattar paneer on rice.  It came with a small side salad and pop ($10).  My friend chose the mango chicken, saag paneer on rice combo ($12.50).  As soon as I took my first bite, I though 'damn, should have ordered the naan instead of rice'.  The rice was cold, hard and clumpy.  I've eaten at King's Palace before and was blown away by their warm and toasty naans.   The paneer on this day was blah...no flavor, kinda greasy and only a few measly cubes of cheese.  I ate about 1/4 of the food on my plate and had no desire to eat more or take the rest with me.  I'm sure my meal could have used a few extra minutes in the nuker.  My friend, on the other hand, gobbled up her entire meal so she really loved her food or was just really hungry.  Next time, I will avoid getting the rice combo and stick with naan instead."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but it's just ok. I love hole in the wall looking places and absolutely adore Indian food.  Here are some quick thoughts: 1) PRO - Enormous selection. I've eaten a lot of Indian food in my life and there is still so much here that I didn't know of.  2) PRO - taste is super authentic, pretty well made. I enjoyed the food. 3) CON - Price is pretty high so a simple take out meal. I think I paid over 10 bucks for a few curries and naan 4) CON - they are quite stingy on serving. Lots of curry, little meat. I only got a 2-3 pieces on my order.  I think it's probably a great place to go if you are drunk but I likely won't be dying to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"It's very rare that I would continue to eat something despite a defect. Their food isn't cheap - $19 for a butter chicken combo with roti. Love their mango shakes but while I was eating my butter chicken, I literally bit hard on a solid chunk of plastic. I went to show them the piece of plastic and according to the owner, there was recently a construction project on the ceiling and some of the plastic or junk may have fallen onto the food. I mean, why aren't you covering your food in the first place?... I didn't get refunded but was offered more - at that point, I was too scared to eat anymore. I finished my plate of butter chicken (damn the flavours were good) but the price was a huge turn off and not to mention that chunk of plastic that could have chipped my tooth. I wish I had a better experience since the mango shakes and butter chicken were good but I'm afraid I won't be coming back ...."}
{"text":"My friends love this place. But let me be honest I did not like it at all. This place offers variety of food with lot of color in it. Also the chicken dint taste fresh. Well it was expected after counting the number of microwaves. I mean seriously \"6 microwaves\" to heat the food. This definitely explains why my food dint taste fresh. I am definitely not visiting this place again.  Price- Reasonable  Ambience- ok  Food- ok and not fresh"}
{"text":"Went in because friends told me to try it if working near it. Ask for the chilli chix paid for it . look at the menu said it's comes with salad& pop ask the lady she gave me the salad but she wanted money for the drink. I showed her the menu that comes with drink she looked over to the other person said something in there language. I left with no drink with a disappointment. The portions was little. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place for lunch very frequently when it was at the Richmond and Sherbourne area.  Then they moved and I was so sad not to get my King Palace fix.  Last week I had the fortune to come to the current location and everything was as I remembered it.  It was as if they picked up the entire building and moved it over.  Even the seating and microwaves were exactly the same.  The food,  as DELICIOUS as ever.  The herbs and spices they use really make the food here bursting with flavour.  I don't care that they nuke the food to heat it up, its still fannnntastic!  They are also open late, so perfect for a late night snack or full on meal!  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ok here we go!!  I've been eating from king palace for over 2 yrs and I have to say this is the best Biryani in Toronto.  Quality: it's the best! What I love about king palace is that I don't have ask if it's spicy or ask for extra spicy. It's just perfect how they make it. Full of flavor. Spice level is on point.  Portion: it's a decent portion and should be able to satisfy the average person.  Price: 10.50  The review is based on their Biryani only and the price of the Biryani is ok for the portion and quality. The curries are a bit on the pricey side but I've had the butter chicken and it's very nice as well. It's not watered.  End result: it's a great place for some really good Biryani and there is a variety of curries as well but the Biryani is addictive."}
{"text":"Take-out diarrhea! We came here to try the Indian food because we had hear it was amazing. We ordered the butter chicken and rice. Worst choice ever. Why do all these cabbies eat here? This restaurant is located at the rear of the Toronto Reference Library and is the pit stop for most of the cab drivers there. That same night, I had a huge bowel movement the size of Texas and let's just say that this was the first and last time I'll ever eat here. Don't eat here please."}
{"text":"Pro:  Excellent food!!  Good Service and a wide variety of options.  Absolutely Love their Butter Chicken.  Cons:   Once they mixed salt instead of sugar in the butter chicken i felt like i was going to puke, they replaced it with a new one and apologized :) Satisfied and happy.  Small Restaurant and chilly inside in the winter."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken/Ghoast Khari one of the curry type and I got straight OIL in my plate compare to meat quantity and I order some chicken leg BBQ and from the smell looks like BBQ last week and now they are still serving this and keep them microwaving it until I don't know when......... BAD food quality.  The food quality is one story and other thing during our visit one of the gentleman from the store looks like owner screaming at top of his lung on one of the female employee I am not sure what happen but I felt so bad for the employee everyone was looking at her..... I am hoping she is OK...... I have a message for that gentleman please treat your employee with respect no matter what and you can coach them in your office not in the cafe area no one deserve to insult like this. BAD MANAGEMENT   This restaurant should need to check by health ministry for people health safety and lastly with labour ministry for employee rights.  Dishes are way expensive as compare to quality and quantity....."}
{"text":"Just a quick update to advise against the combos listed on the wall. While they're a good value --hovering around the $10-13 mark for two or three items-- throwing them all in the same container is a disaster. By the time we got home our chili chicken, mixed veg and lamb curry were one. Still tasted good, but I wish we had got them in separate containers.  Other than that, keep calm and curry on, KP."}
{"text":"When I'm famished after a long night at the local watering hole, King Palace is a good place to head for a filling meal. The portions are massive and affordable, and the naan is cooked while you wait. The place is always teeming with South Asian youth and the parking lot filled with cab drivers - especially in the middle of the night (3-4am when the bars let out). Sometimes it's hard to grab a table but luckily the food lends itself well to takeout!  And yeah, it's true - they do always have the TV set to South Asian music videos!!"}
{"text":"Any restaurant that has 6 microwaves at the front of the house can't be good. I have not tasted the food, but microwaved food is definitely not something I want to pay this much for! And yes I noticed a lot of good reviews before coming here."}
{"text":"Terrible food. I asked the guy to give me his recommendation. The pieces of chicken were not good ones. Neither was the food fresh. I could tell it was cooked several hours, maybe even days ago. The best thing served was fresh naan bread. Service was ok. Maybe they had an off day. But I can't even think about the food."}
{"text":"Got the Kashmiri chicken with briyani combo. Pathetic food. The food was stale didnt taste good. The food is microwaved and served. For a combo, they charged me $17, extremely over priced for tasteless food. There are many other great restaurants to try Indian/Pakistani food. This places paints a really bad picture of Indian/Pakistani food."}
