{"text":"Fun little place! We stopped by for lunch, so it was fairly quiet. I can totally see this place rocking when there's events happening. The food quality was great. I had a burger with a wonderful remoulade on it, and would certainly recommend it.

The server/bartender and the chef were both highly personable and wanted to make sure we were happy with our food."}
{"text":"Stopped by for takeout during the week. Service was quick and staff were friendly. Best of all - the food was great! Love seeing this concept in downtown Cleveland. Ingredients were fresh and price was reasonable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had a great time at 2nd and High and the poke was awesome. Staff was very friendly and accommodating to our requests and order. We had two bowls and and order of the buns. Finding a local place with poke in Northeast Ohio is a challenge and this group delivered a great product. Will likely be our spot when we come in town for Tribe/Cavs games."}
{"text":"This is definitely off the beaten path... but worth turning the corner! 
We enjoyed several custom made (by us) cocktails! I found it fun and refreshing! It was hot outside and these Adult snow cones fit the bill! 
I suggest trying the cream soda in one... underused mixer, but so yummy! And the fresh fruit adds made me feel better about the booze! 
The kitchen was closed while we were there! Not sure why... it was 3ish in the afternoon during an Indians game. Too bad they missed out on us over ordering fried treats... perhaps next visit. 
Try this still secret spot... perfect for summer day drinking! 

Much !!!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a convention and went looking for sushi. 2nd & High came up as a close option (staying at the Renaissance). Very glad I chose it! Was able to build a poke bowl with all of my favorite bits and pieces. Plenty of meat in the bowl, and the champagne margarita was delicious too! Servers were friendly and prompt! I'd absolutely come back if I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Watch out for the cocktail prices.  I ordered a mid-level bourbon (Buffalo Trace - $30/bottle at the store) thinking it would run me $8 per drink.  Shame on me for not asking.  Got the bill and it turned out to be $11.45!    Way too pricey for what this place is.  Especially when a cocktail at the Q is \"only\" $11."}
{"text":"Ordered the Garden of Lucifer, I had the feedback that my drink was far too sweet and the head of the bar told me the employee made my drink incorrectly and had already told him he added too much agave. Neither one of them offer to remake my drink when I still had not even drank half of it. Disappointing for a brand new bar"}
{"text":"We (4 of us) were there yesterday about 4 PM.  We were the only folks in the restaurant, which is not indicative of the quality.  This was the first Poke experience for 3 of us and we really enjoyed it.  The server was terrific and the food exceeded expectations (I had the shrimp poke).  We stayed until about 6 and had a great time.

This place is worth finding."}
{"text":"Great experience! Service was exceptional! The poke was fresh. We really liked it! Tried a poke bowl and it was light and the steam bun 
was flavorful!

So happy to see that CLE is getting high quality poke places!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and really tasty. The staff is super friendly here too! The food is priced a bit on the high side, but that is to be expected since there arent many other poke bowl places around."}
{"text":"Our service was outstanding, as was the food. Our drinks (we sampled quite a few) were delicious AND fun! Snowcones for adults? Yes, please! Have the Manhattan! It was perfection!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I went to dinner here and absolutely loved it! The drinks were perfect, I got the Manhattan, which I highly recommend. I chose a poke bowl and did a build you own with tuna and salmon, multiple veggies and two of the sauces. We are looking forward to going back again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Really great cocktails and the poke bowl was BOSS! Very fresh ingredients and the taste was good with every bite...split a polka bowl with my wife that had salmon and tuna...also had a few of the steamed buns: glazed hoisin mushrooms, garlic shrimp and pork belly...lots of flavor in each one of them and a nice bite...Jenny our bartender made her own recipe margarita (super good) for my wife and I had a nice old fashioned...both drinks excellent...she was super informative for food recommendations and above all very nice...we also met Matt the owner who made our food and was also very friendly...my wife and I will definitely come back here in the future knowing you can have great cocktails and good quality food...place to go in Cleveland for poke!"}
{"text":"I really do not know how this place has 4 stars. I hate to write a bad review, but this place really needs to work out its kinks. My friends and I recently visited here with high hopes of a filling poke bowl, but we're all very disappointed. Firstly, you cannot price something for $12+ and serve it in a cardboard plate that is half the size of a chipotle bowl. Secondly, the pokerrito is literally an $11 sushi roll with barely any fish in it and tons of rice. Lastly, payed $34 for a bowl, a pokerrito, and a beer only to then have to buy food at the cavs game because none of us were even close to being full. Hope they can take the advice that other yelpers are posting on here- it would help a lot."}
{"text":"This place has such fun drinks! I always keep going back for the Mayan Surf!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving three stars is because I don't want to discourage this kind of concept - Cleveland needs more of this type of quick, healthy and fun food! I just had some issues with the poke. The tuna and salmon tasted fresh, but they were cut into uneven sizes and some of them were way too big. Same with the cucumbers. The toppings in general were delicious, though they did forget my seaweed salad which bummed me out. My biggest issue though - those little cardboard boats! How have none of the other reviews mentioned this?? You can't even attempt to get a bite with all the elements of the poke unless you knock a bunch of stuff on the table.

I wouldn't normally be so critical in a review if it weren't for the fact that I want to come back so badly! With a couple of tweaks this place could be totally killer."}
{"text":"Came out to celebrate my sisters birthday! Daniel and Alex were awesome! Party of ten and Daniel didn't miss a beat. Made great recommendations for food and beverages. Very personable. Even played photog at the end of the night for us. Funny thing was they guys at the bar behind him were taking a picture of his butt!!!! Made me laugh. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Update: this establishment reached out via a ranting comment on my opinion of their cleanliness. Let me say that if it wasn't for the fact that their green onions had dirt stuck on them still, this kind of response is the reason why I won't ever return or be recommending their business. I never leave 1 star reviews. It so disappointing because I really want to like it since there really isn't alot of options for poke bowls in Cle. 
I will also add that my order was a take out order and I'm not reviewing the restaurant itself. I can assure that it was in fact dirt and not sauce, I literally scrapped it off and rubbed it between my fingers then decided not to proceed eating after realizing it was clearly dirt and not pepper or sauce. And it was on several pieces of green onions.
I understand the hard work that went into starting a small business and appreciate that aspect but it's also customers honest opinions that help give new businesses feedback for improvement. I hope they take this into consideration and improve vs. spending that time to argue with patrons."}
{"text":"3.5 stars I think they may have some kinks to work out.  The quality of the food is decent but I need to offer feedback.
The poke is served in a like a box that you would associate fries or chicken wings with. This needs to be served in a bowl. 

The sauces are not easy to incorporate with the veggies/filler doe to it not being in a bowl. 

There was no spicy poke option. One of the best spicy poke bowls I had was from Whole Foods in Oahu. I called them up after my trip and they told me how they made the sauce. 

I was going to get the salmon bowl however I noticed that the salmon had that brown part of that stripe down the middle. To me that part of the fish smells like cat food, super fishy. I know some people are into hyper fishy tastes, however most Americans are not.

Tuna quality was pretty good."}
{"text":"Solid spot with good food and service. Close to the Q and easy stop before a game. Once they get fully going I think this will be a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"A gem hidden in the alley! The cocktail list looked delish, but I was there for lunch. 

Got poke bowl with salmon, avocado, sea weed and onion flakes! Was really good!

Mushroom bun was okay..maybe cook down the shrooms to bring out the flavor even more?"}
{"text":"5 stars for drinks! The passiontini is fruity and fun- not too sweet. The champagne margarita is a deliciously unique combination of the best drinks known to man. Atmosphere is cozy and cute."}
{"text":"Awesome cocktail lounge at the corner of 2nd & High, you can make your own drinks!! Service was great, really cute girls and good food. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"By far my favorite downtown establishment.  The staff is exceptionally friendly, the cocktails are well made, and the food is both decent and suitable for a wide range of dietary concerns.  Though the following by no means detracted from my experience, I would personally prefer a bit more standardization with recipes and glassware amongst varying bartenders as well as a few more craft beers on tap (not a big can fan).  Paradoxically, I wish 2nd and high fantastic success, yet selfishly desire the personal service that accompanies a less visited destination.  Best to you all!"}
{"text":"Husband and I were excited to visit this place yesterday, and boy were we disappointed.
Husband order the garlic shrimp rice bowl w/ garbanzo bean salad
I ordered the chicken Katsu  w/ garbanzo bean salad
1-pork belly steam bun
1-bar-b-q steam bun
1-mushroom steam bun
Order comes to the table - husband order was correct
Instead of the chicken katsu, the cook/owner decides to make me the garlic shrimp bowl just like my husband. 
Waitress said he was confused by my order slip
So essentially, we paid for rice with chili sauce mixed w/two pieces of mushroom and one slice of red onion and very small shrimp.
Steam buns had to be dissected b/c there was more lettuce than meat, seriously & they weren't even warm
Including my husband & myself there were three other guests at the bar, so our order should have at least correct. 
Taste wise, they have some work ahead of them if they are truly trying to achieve a the flavors of Hawaii. 
We were really excited about the drinks descriptions-but unfortunately disappointed yet again. 
As my husband put it - your not going to hit a home run every-time."}
{"text":"Great new place for Poke near Progressive Field and East Fourth. 
Food was excellent and creative.  Very reasonably priced. 
This looks like a rebranding of a game day bar (which is still open ). Very casual. Food served in paper bowls. This is a fun place with good food that is not common around Cleveland.  Don't expect upscale."}
{"text":"Super dope place!! Super dope vibe! I loved the customer service and the food and drinks were on point!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and attentive service (the staff remembered us from the week before from our first time in). I've had poke in Maui and this stuff is just as good! More people should eat here. But for now, it's a great spot if you're running low on time before a Cavs or Indians game because there are always open tables."}
{"text":"Hidden away in a prime spot in downtown Cleveland, this place is everything. 

I loved them before the new \"poke\" change. I love them even more now. The help is great, the food is fresh and the drinks keep on coming. I was so lucky to try their poke before their opening night and I must say, it's superb. So many different options, a \"build your own\" menu...and who has poke around here? No one! Such a great concept.

The bar itself is a great layout. Beautiful bar and seating. 

Just overall a great vibe of a place. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Didn't really know what I wanted so I asked the owner. He had suggested the Catfish poboy but I can't eat much bread so I went with the catfish bites instead and their 2 high fries (I think that's the name). I was actually pleasantly surprised with the catfish. I haven't had good catfish in a while and this was great. Cooked perfectly and didn't have that deep fryer taste that sometimes comes along with fish. The fries were amazing. Garlic Parmesan on them and it was great! Not soggy and fresh cut. Their sauce that came with the catfish bites was great! I don't know what was in it but it was great! The staff was great. The waitress was sweet and checked with us and even had a nice chat with us. The manager was friendly and checked to see how our food was. There are plenty of tv's if u wanna watch something while eating. The tables were clean and not sticky and all tables are fluffy people friendly. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Takes a bit of work to find, and I only knew about it because I had been a fan of 21 Lounge, the previous incarnation of this space. While that place's bar food was solid, it is nice to have something unique in its place. I really like the poke bowl concept, whether you build your own or go with a preset one; all of the ingredients are fresh and tasty, and it's easy to eat pretty healthy if that's your thing. Drinks are definitely a strong suit, and I've enjoyed a bunch of their cocktail creations. The beer list is on the small side, but there are some good options. Food service has always been prompt, but I have gone long periods with an empty glass in front of me."}
{"text":"I came to this spot when it first opened with a bunch of co-workers - but recently read that they are a Poke bar too so had to stop in for lunch. You place your food order on a sheet, and they have 4 or 5 set poke bowls to choose from or you are able to customize your own. All for $12. I went with a pre-made bowl with both Ahi and Salmon and LOVED it! It came with avocado which they do not skimp on - it was an entire half. Everything about our experience was awesome! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch after Cleveland International Film Festival. This place is tucked away in a corner near the casino--very convenient for a drink or bite if you're already downtown, probably not so much so if you're making a trip to specifically come here. 

Interior is clean and trendy with lots of wood and TV screens. Not many people inside for weekend lunch, but probably gets very lively at night. Service was very prompt and friendly. I tried the Hawaiian iced tea, which was supposed to be brewed with cinnamon and pineapple, but the cinnamon was a bit strong for my taste and overwhelmed the drink, even after I requested some sweetener (bartender cheerfully added simple syrup for me).

As others have mentioned, poke bowls are a bit small in cardboard trays. I've had poke in California, which is my gold-standard, and Denver (unfortunately haven't made it to Hawaii). Portions are small compared to most places in Cali. White rice is plain (not seasoned nor sushi rice) and mine was a little over-liberally laced with shoyu (soy sauce). Other options include for base include brown rice, squash noodles, or greens. I went with the Polka bowl (ahi, salmon, avocado, seaweed salad, cucumber, and tobiko) which was fresh and tasty, but next time I'll probably go with make your own--my dining partner really liked the pineapple--to see if I can find a different flavor combination.

Fish and toppings were fresh, but the combination of the soy sauce and aioli was not quite the flavor I expected. I'll probably stop in again if I'm in the area, but will remind myself to expect a different style of poke."}
{"text":"First time here and it was absolutely amazing. I love the idea behind the poke bowl and this place is extremely fresh from the veggies to the sea food. It is definitely a modern twist on any old bar or meal. It is definitely still newer and I feel like there will be many new and exciting additions to come, but it definitely is delicious and has much more potential in store."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted by the bartender with a friendly smile and a hello. The Pork Steam bun was as delicious as she described. The Ahi Tuna Bowl was refreshing and loaded with flavor from the toppings I choose. Close to the Q and Progressive field."}
{"text":"Okay.. so I have to start out this by saying 1: the server was super sweet and very attentive. And 2: the tuna was delicious, fresh, didn't taste fishy at all. 
The main issue we had is with the poke bowls. I ordered a brown rice base, hubby ordered white rice. For starters, both rice bases were massively undercooked. I'm talking crunchy rice. I don't mind that as much, but my husband did not like that. Rice aside, there were some issues with the toppings.... she brought out the bowls and I recognized certain things only I Had ordered (ginger, beets) but it was on the white rice (his) bowl. And then on the opposite side, we both ordered tortilla strips but they were only on one bowl. So I don't even know which one was supposed to be which! I ended up eating the white rice bowl while he had the brown. It was good, but not even close to all the toppings we had ordered and the portion size is very small compared to poke bowls I've had for the same price in LA, NYC, and even Columbus."}
{"text":"Though not visible from the Main Street, walk down 2 or high until you get to the back and you will this location tucked away. The charm of this place quickly was lost The potential to return quickly diminished after the lack of service, customer appreciation and overall experience that I encountered from my short time here.

The bartender had made a drink incorrectly and instead of making it again, the mentality was \"oh well, not my fault\" after he had vocalized it was incorrect. To further that, the same gentleman who had made that comment then proceeded to print out my check and talk to a person for over 3 minutes with it in his hand just to make me wait. I have worked in the restaurant industry for many years and have never seen such poor character displayed to a guest.

On the flip side, you can make your own slushy drink by choosing the liquor, wash etc., which appeared to be great, but I did not try it. This concept is very barrio style, br for drinks. Also, drinks are very expensive for the quality, be careful on what you get.

I believe this place has potential if they put their guests' experience first rather than their own egos. I hope to come back and change this, but until I hear other experiences we're better, it may be a while."}
{"text":"Purchased tickets for New Years. Worked with the manager and she was super friendly and easy to get along with. She accommodated my large party and booked us tables so we have somewhere to sit. Can't wait to celebrate Gatsby style!"}
{"text":"Can you leave zero stars? Made a reservation on Open Table. Went there and they were closed. Nice."}
{"text":"Poke was great - really fresh tasting!  Stopped in to try this place during Restaurant Week.  We each choose the make-your-own Poke bowl option and shared catfish appetizer and steamed buns.  The food and service were excellent.  The server explained how the menu worked and made some flavor selections.  Glad that we read about their recent major menu change to Poke.  The reviews from 2017 made no sense based on the current menu.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has great drinks and you can customize to your liking and also make to a snow cone as well if you wish. The bartender Alex for short has a great personality and makes you feel just at home I work in the service in history and I love coming to this place. The location is a little bit hidden but it's just by E. 4th St. in between the parking garage and the stadium. The food was great my girlfriend at the hamburger and loved it and I got the chicken tenders but they were freshly battered and grills there is no greasiest behind them and they had an amazing french fry they came with them. Highly suggested."}
{"text":"I came to 2nd and High Poke House + Bar on 4/7/18 for drinks and again for lunch on 4/10/18.  This place is great!!! It's located right at the intersection of East 2nd Street and High Avenue, conveniently tucked away south of Prospect Avenue and just a block west of East 4th Street for those that are not familiar with the downtown area.  The bar/restaurant is basically right near all of the downtown Cleveland action and a 2 minute walk to Quicken Loans Arena or Progressive Field.

Let me start out by saying that this place is very nice inside and well put together.  It's updated, clean, and the wrap around bar made of copper is gorgeous and very unique! All of the staff were super friendly and attentive as well, which is key in my book for any operation in this area and makes for an overall pleasant experience.

I tried the build your own Poke bowl which was delicious! The presentation was great and I was so hungry I devoured it before taking a picture!  I ordered my Poke bowl with white rice, salmon, avocado, edamame, ginger, mango, sesame seeds, scallion and a few other fillings.  Everything was extremely fresh and delicious!!! The quality of the salmon was excellent and I look forward to trying the Ahi tuna the next time I visit. 

The drinks here are also excellent! I recommend trying something off of the specialty cocktail menu. I had the Smoked Manhattan which was really unique as the drink itself was smoked in a glass chamber using apple wood chips.  This really added a unique flavor profile/aroma to the drink that I highly recommend.  It's definitely worth trying, especially if you enjoy Manhattans.

I also had the \"Billionaire\", which was a Bourbon based drink that was very good. This drink caught my attention as it had Absinthe in it, a spirit that is hard to come by in cocktails in the area.

Overall as someone who lives and works in downtown Cleveland, I think 2nd and High Poke House is a great spot to have in the heart of the city.  The Poke bowls are light, fresh, and delicious, and the craft cocktails are refreshing as well. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!! What a hidden gem!! Located walking distance from the Q and the Progressive field. 

It's an extremely clean and well-kept bar with friendly service!!

Great beer specials and the menu is simple yet diverse. Everything from Kimchi to Pork Belly steamed buns. 

They're known for their signature to go bowls. Give it a go!!"}
