{"text":"The Portuguese tarts were really delicious! Much better than the ones at St. Lawrence Market. Plus, the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!! be forewarned as a customer I order a tosta mista which is a toasted ham and cheese sandwich when it got to the table it was hard as a rock and burnt being Portuguese this is a staple for breakfast or brunch . After waiting over 10 minutes the waitress brings us our order which was burnt and hard so explaining this to her she abruptly replies to my boyfriend that it's not her fault he is in an unhappy mood this morning and that the sandwiches are not burnt ! Having worked in that industry myself that is beyond rude and not something you ever say to a client. Without even an apology she takes our plates comes back six minutes later with new sandwiches not burnt not hard and pretty much tosses our plates onto the table without saying a word and walks away. Upon paying we brought this to the attention of someone else and I need a complaint saying that I was going to call the manager she comes from around the corner and start saying that it's not her fault where in bad moods and we're bad clients so being  Portuguese we replied that if she does not like this industry maybe she shouldn't be working here.  Horrible horrible horrible service at this place ever since the original owner passed away Joe and his wife have taken over this bakery and they have a done absolutely nothing to bring this bakery up from the dumps that it is , the waitresses with the exception of Jessica are all unhappy miserable ladies walking around , they have tableservice which takes or 15 minutes to get a waitress to your table and then when they finally take your order it's like they're doing you a favor.   I regret The decision of having breakfast at all, bakery I should've stuck to my regular coffee shop which ever since it opened up I've stopped going to Alcoa!  There is an amazing little coffee shop around the corner at  davenport/Oakwood and thats my coffee place now ,services is always great , coffee is delicious & baked goods are always fresh and I'm hoping that Alcoa bakery clients open their eyes !!!!! Stop giving business to a bakery that isn't thankful it's still has business!"}
{"text":"Had a latte, special toast with ham and cheese as well as natta which is a Portuguese custard treat.  It was great and great prices too and I think that's why it's a local hangout.  I wouldn't come here for a Sunday brunch with the family but will come here to grab a quick coffee and a sandwich or a fresh bread."}
{"text":"One of Toronto's best secrets! Friendly staff and patrons make you feel right at home. Best cappuccino I've had in Toronto--and for a great price, too. Delicious pastries and breads, spicy deli meats, and the fish balls...oh, the fish balls!"}
{"text":"Their pastries are typical Portuguese pastries. They have varieties enough. I ordered custard tart and custard pudding as usual with coffee. They are good and they are standard. In this bakery, there are many male customers and they seem to be dating their waitress. It was strange for outsiders."}
{"text":"Brings you to a staple of portuguese coffee culture. Good portuguese tarts ( Pasteis de Nata) and selection of portuguese sweets and day to day products;)"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood of this bakery. It is a nice destination for a quick breakfast on the weekend (it has a sit down area and coffee stand) or to pick up bakery items throughout the week.  The selection of portuguese pastries rivals any in the city. I recommend the cream horns. It also offers other Portuguese food staples like specialty cereals.  It is a great place to get fresh buns and baguettes too at decent prices (baguette = 1.50). The deli section is small but all the important coldcuts can be found there. Also great fish cakes for a quick snack!  The only problem I see is that the pastries/bread section has a different line than the deli counter and therefore if you want to get stuff for a full sandwich and a sweet treat, you usually have to wait in two lines."}
{"text":"I first started coming to this place 15 years or so ago, i love it's simple straight forward attitude, portuguese style bakery / coffee shop where you can eat and drink their foods and watch portuguese TV. their coffee is great, their toasted sandwiches / panini style called \"Tosta Mishta\" are awesome. If you're looking for a quick coffee with a sandwich or maybe some dessert, bread or deli items check these guys out. it's worth it."}
{"text":"These custard tarts are so good, I may become an Alcoa-holic.  What to get: Portuguese Custard Tart  I did a \"Portuguese custard tart tour\" of Toronto and tried about 10 different places for this tiny little amazing item. This one was good, but not amazing, hence the rating. It was cheaper than some (under $1.20) but didn't taste as fresh or creamy or flaky as the best of the best. Still really good though and well worth trying if you come to this bakery.  I also got some Portuguese soda (Sumol) because I'm addicted to it, especially the orange kind.  Service was fine and they're open super late compared to other local bakeries which I appreciate.  Now I'm done with this review, Alcoand write another."}
{"text":"The best tarts and then much more. This is a wonderful little place where freshly baked goodies abound. I took a couple of my favorite ladies there and we had a wonderful little treat.  I had not eaten lunch, and I ordered a custom sandwich with dry salamis of my choice. I also had a capapucino and one of the absolutely most wonderful tarts which are their specialty.  The ladies each had a specialty coffee and shared a wonderful pastry.  For all that goodness the bill was under $13.00 all in! Good and reasonnable....what a combo....."}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to bakery until the management changed. Every week things are rearranged again, and staples like whole wheat bread are often hard to find. Used to get at least two loaves a week, now half the time they don't have it - just dessert-y breads with fruit in them or whatever.  And if you ask for it sliced, sometimes they slice it properly, sometimes in giant thick slabs. Feh. But now they've got a hot table, and a salad bar, and a breakfast special, and... basically so many things they don't have time to concentrate on baking. It's a shame because this place was such a great standby before! Hoping the new management recover their senses and get things back on track.  UPDATE: Alcoa has now closed. Real shame as it was such a neighbourhood standby for decades up until the change in ownership. Hope a new bakery moves in soon!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try another Portuguese bakery and googled.  Came here based on the Blog TO top ten list ...... and yelp reviews of coz......... This is more like a family restaurant.  Very friendly staffs.  Great coffee.  Less variety of pastries than Seara bakery, and their Portuguese tart is a bit sweeter.  I like their pastries over Seara.  It's more puffy....... very puffy fluffy............ One of the customers recommended the grilled cheese veal sandwich.  She said she has the sandwich almost everyday.  Will come back for the sandwich!  Tart is just a dollar and $1.75 for the pastry.  Great price : )   Had learned to say the tart and pastry in Portuguese, but had been \"digested\" together with the tart and pastry........ got to go back and learn again ........ lol :p"}
{"text":"The place is great; they are open from 4:30am to 10:00pm daily, and everything is fresh. Often, they are busy and you have to wait to be served. I do think they need to get faster toasters/grills because the one they have now is slow, and there's certainly room for improvement when it comes to customer service, but other than that, the food is great and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Get my bread from here multiple times a week. Delicious bread, decent deserts, the best espresso in the area hands down. The staff is very rude though and they talk smack in Portuguese to each other not knowing I'm actually Portuguese. I put it up with it because the espresso is so good."}
{"text":"Very nice people. Good coffee. Really good and cheap desserts. Decent veal sandwiches with light fluffy bread but without much density.   The service though is what makes this place. Dessert is very good though. Ordered a coffee to go with 3 milk and the lady behind the counter was like \"let me warm that up for you (the milk) it's cold outside.\"  Love this place. Very homie, warm, cozy, with nice people. Not the fanciest place, but simple, cheap, and reminds me of home."}
{"text":"I randomly stopped by Alcoa on the way to a dinner party and was pleasantly surprised despite not having great expectations. The bakery is set up as a very versatile shop that sells everything from specialty deli to items you would find only in a corner store!  Walk straight past these distractions to the counter with Portuguese tarts and here you will find a little bit of heaven. Alcosa offers great variety and the prices are more than reasonable at about 1.50/tart! I'd recommend trying the one with the brownish filling. The bittersweet taste of orange peel comes through in perfect harmony with other flavours making this one of my new favourite treats in the city.   Overall a good stop for tarts if you're on the block."}
{"text":"The moment I stepped inside Alcoa Bakery, I feel like I am transferred to one of the smaller village in Portugal...  The staffs all have this big smile on their faces, addressing all the customers by their first names. Older folks enjoying their coffee while chatting with everyone around them. TVs are tuned into Portuguese's CP24/Sportnet.  Double Espresso is for sure a great pick me up went well with my egg custard tart.  Great place to come in for a nice coffee break! Or just to pick up some baked goods: bread and desserts both looks and smell great!"}
{"text":"If you head north on Ossington -- all the way up -- you will find a Portuguese pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Alcoa Bakery is a spacious shop with a deli, delicious baked treats and for some reason a glass case sparsely filled with dusty, plastic-wrapped toys, each priced at $10.   I had the veal sandwich here and it's a beaut. It's positively stuffed with meat and peppers and the bread is soft and tasty. They've got a fridge filled with cold drinks so if you have a hankering for Sumol, you know where to go.  The service is super friendly here, an the prices are great. Three of us ate for about $20 total. Definitely worth the trek.  Obligatory Title Pun: This roomy bakeshop's no ALCOve.  Menu Readability: The staff will tell you what's what.  Need to mention: As far as I know they are not affilated with any aluminum producers.  What this place teaches me about myself: There is something strangely alluring about toys you to need a key to access."}
