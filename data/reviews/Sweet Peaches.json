{"text":"Delicious brunch!  From the starter hunky doughnuts to the blackberry French toast and latke.  Classic but with unique twist. Bacon was also savory side I'd recommend.  Cute place, with bit of a grandma's kitchen feel. Friendly, genuine staff!  Definitely worth going a bit out of your way to start your day at Sweet Peaches!"}
{"text":"My parents live in Mt. Washington and I discovered Sweet Peaches a few months ago.  When I returned to Pittsburgh for a business meeting last week I stopped by and tried some lunch there. I returned last weekend to visit friends, and I went again this time for Sunday brunch.    The place is great hidden gem in the growing Allentown corridor.  The owner Bek Hlavach is an established and successful caterer in the city and opened this restaurant as a side business.  They serve lunch five days and brunch on Sunday.  The restaurant is small with an eclectic feel to it.  If you're not into a big meal, the coffee, and teas are wonderful as is the freshly-squeezed juice.  Three dishes you have to try at the Sunday Bruch include their Lumberjack Omelet which includes bacon, sausage, mushrooms, broccoli rabe and smoked cheddar cheese; the Sweet Peach Omelet which includes arugula, red onions and goat cheese; and the Paris Twist sandwich which was smoked turkey, red onions and melted brie on a pretzel croissant--I think they sprinkled bacon on it which was not on the menu. but hey it's bacon and was a wonderful surprise.  I say keep it.  If you like independent restaurants that deliver the goods, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Went to sweet peaches for brunch, excellent service and the food was amazing! Lemon poppyseed pancakes were the best pancakes I've ever had! Everything here is just the best, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"We tried Sweet Peaches after reading about them in an article about best brunch spots in the city. We were not disappointed! The service was excellent the food was delicious and came out quickly and the Zekes coffee was amazing. All of this and the staff was attentive and friendly to our kids... Always a plus. This place will definitely be on our brunch rotation. Tip: the potatoes that come with the breakfast are to die for."}
{"text":"Sweet Peaches catered a wedding I attended and the food was a highlight of delicious diversity in flavors and textures. Just learned there is now a restaurant location. Yay!!"}
{"text":"Making the list for top brunch spots in Pittsburgh I had to give this place a try. I heard mixed reviews and with it not being located in the best section of town, I was a little skeptical at first.  We made reservations online through Yelp-very cool did not know you could do that.  I wasn't convinced they had the reservation when we checked in with the friendly host but luckily there was one table in the corner left for us. This place is small so I highly recommend making a reservation. It was busy for Sunday brunch but we got our drink order taken right away.  It is BYOB and wished we brought champagne for mimosas.  Regardless the fresh squeezed OJ is delicious but not sure it if worth the hefty 3.50$ for a small glass. They have a nice selection of entrees from your typical breakfast foods to sandwiches.  I went with the famous sweet peaches pancakes which came topped with a peach topping and whipped cream! It was decant and enough for leftovers. All the entrees came with a side of fresh fruit or salad which was an added bonus. Others in my party got the lumber jack omelet with toast and a turkey and Brie sandwich. These portions were a bit small but enough to not leave you hungry. The wait staff was very friendly and very proud of the entrees being served."}
{"text":"Seriously cannot say enough good things about Sweet Peaches. From the amazing looking and crazy delicious food, to the wonderful owner. This place is a hidden gem in Pittsburgh's Warrington/Beltzhoover neighborhood. Everything is made with the freshest local ingredients. The menu changes often. You can't go wrong with brunch on Sunday's from 10am-3pm. On this visit I had pancakes with a tequila lime curd and fresh berries. Simply amazing. I highly recommend an order of bacon. It's some of the thickest and most flavorful bacon in the city(locally sourced of course). If you want to treat your tastebuds to something really good, you've got to try the Cheese Monger Mac N Cheese if it's on the menu. So good!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food! My daughter and I dined there for brunch on a Sunday and I was completely bowled over. My daughter went for sweet and ordered the Boston Cream French Toast and the fruit starter plate. I went for savory and we were both super happy with our dishes. The juice is fresh pressed! My daughter said, \"mom! this tastes like an orange!\"   My coffee cup never went cold or empty and the service was very friendly. If you are going for brunch, assume you'll be there for about an hour or so. But it's brunch, why are you in a hurry?   I've had other occasions to sample lunch and catering offerings and everything has been exceptional.   I most definitely recommend Sweet Peaches and your next brunch there will be amazing!"}
{"text":"Sweet Peaches recently catered our wedding and I can't say enough positive things about the food and people there. When we were searching for a caterer and asking for suggestions recommendations for Sweet Peaches kept coming up again and again.   Joe, the event coordinator, was incredibly helpful and quick to respond to any questions that I had during the planning process. We were required to rent just about everything for our reception because it was not provided by the venue and Joe handled everything with the rental company, which took a lot off of my plate. I had complete trust in Joe and knew that everything for our day was in good hands.   Bek's food is fantastic and we received so many compliments from guests. Some guests seemed genuinely surprised at how flavorful and delicious the food was and that it wasn't the typical bland wedding buffet. Not only was the food delicious, the presentation of everything was beautiful. Sweet Peaches provided gorgeous wild flowers and runners for the food tables. They also incorporated sprigs of rosemary on all of the guest napkins, which in addition to smelling great, gave a nice pop of color against the white linens and fit in with our outdoor garden party reception.   The serving staff was incredibly friendly and did a great job of getting all of the food served and plates cleared promptly.   One of the things we really enjoyed about working with Sweet Peaches was the menu tasting we did with them a few weeks before the wedding. We took our parents and a few bottle of wine and tasted everything we were going to be serving at the wedding. It was such a nice way to go over any last minute details and put us at ease knowing that they had everything under control.   If you're looking for a caterer, I can't recommend Sweet Peaches enough. Also, their brunch is fantastic so if you haven't stopped in to eat on a Sunday, you should."}
{"text":"This is the absolute best meal I have had in my 8 years in this city.  That's a pretty steep statement. I've had incredible food in Pittsburgh, but this place is a cut above the rest. Everything is thoughtfully prepared with very, very fresh ingredients, artful flavor combinations, and an insane attention to detail.  I went for brunch and got the Chef's Big Breakfast so that I could try a little of everything. French Toast with Lemon curd, berries, and candied ginger, An omelet with several perfectly prepared meats and chard, Home-made potatoes in this indescribable horseradish sauce... EVERYTHING was spot on. Down to the tiniest detail. Even the raspberries blew my mind; they were the best I've had since I was a child and I could eat them right out of my backyard.  I need this in my life. This is real, genuine food made by real, genuine people."}
{"text":"I first tried Sweet Peaches several months ago at a Wizard of Oz themed event at Carnegie Library. Their offering was 3 different types of chicken legs. The one I remember had a Thai citrus sauce and was delicious. Their brick and mortar location is a small maybe 10 table restaurant with a nice down home feel. Upon entering we were greeted by the very friendly hostess/waiter. He offered water right away and also asked if we wanted coffee, tea, or juice. I went with coffee and my little man went with a freshly made carrot orange ginger juice. I could hear the juicer working in the kitchen as we waited. My coffee was smooth and tasted great. I personally like a very strong coffee with lots of creamer so my only complaint might be the coffee could have been stronger but I also could have ordered a cup of espresso or French press so my fault really. On the plus side the coffee is served with real cream!! For my main dish I went with their version of a club sandwich. All entrees are served with a salad or fresh fruit. I went with fruit as did my boy. The fruit was perfectly fresh and a great start to the meal. When my sandwich came out my first thought was my mouth isn't that big. The sandwich is quite large and came with a small side of potato salad. My favorite part of the sandwich was the honey mustard. It really made the sandwich. The bread is also worth mentioning. It was slightly grilled and very fresh. My son had s'more pancakes for his entree and I have to say they were also large and in charge and absolutely mouth watering. Maybe not the greatest for a meal but hay it's brunch. I love small local places like this. It's honestly in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood but I like that they're bringing business to a place I feel many would over look. Great job Sweet Peaches."}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation from a coworker and was pleasantly surprised! We had reservations for 4 ppl and based on the size of the dining area I'd recommend them. The warm Feel Better juice, zucchini bread with peanut butter, and french toast were amazing! Definitely will return for brunch!"}
{"text":"I went to Sweet Peaches for Sunday brunch with big expectations from what I heard and read... I had a reservation at 115pm and I arrived at 117 and they said I was late and gave away my table... As soon as I walked in the place I smelled an old smell... Idk if it was the building;because it is not updated) or the customers but there was a definite odor in the place.. To note my girlfriend didn't smell it... The servers also were not properly groomed and were not professional at all... The food was good besides everything else I had to deal with... The bulletproof coffee was unique,tasty and strong.. The breakfast entrees tasted good as well..."}
{"text":"Came into sweet peaches with some high exceptions. After word of mouth and reading reviews. And I was sort of let down.  There are some good qualities and some qualities that were just meh.  So here we go. The atmosphere and decorations are top notch. Love the whisk chandeliers!! However, service and speed not their strong suit.   The male server who we never got his name started us off with warm tap water. I have no issue with tap but come on man, gimme some ice. Especially since it's August.  When order I was pretty geeked that a monte cristo was on the menu.  It was also a nice touch that each entree came with fruit plate or side salad.  Well thank god we got the fruit plate and salad to start our brunch, bc otherwise I would of thought I was signing up for the monastery, and starting my fasting. It took soooooooo long for our food, and there was only around 14 ppl in restaurant.   So on to the food. Monte Cristo was filled with roast beef, turkey, & ham. The roast beef and turkey were a different enjoyable touch. But I'm not so sure I enjoyed the honey mustard replacement a fruit spread. Also the bread was soggy I was expecting at least a slight crust for a Monte cristo.   The wife got raspberry ricotta French toast. Same scenario. Soggy French toast. When ordering she thought the raspberry & ricotta would be a spread in between the bread. She thought wrong. It was just same raspberries (some of which were moldy) and what looked like some everyday store bought ricotta. Blah!!   So in conclusion, I would give this place another try, it seems like there are some interesting things. But hire some help in the kitchen so it doesn't take forever, and please don't send out moldy fruit."}
{"text":"This place might be the best new brunch spot to come along.  I mean my god, I think my knees buckled on the way out I was so stunned.  They take such pride in their food it tasted as if they whip their own cream for your coffee...which by the way was addictive(Zeke's).  I had the pork tenderloin breakfast which was heaven!  My girl had the peach pancakes...mmmmmm make sure you treat yourself.  It was one of those small diamond in the rough sunday morning finds that make the rest of your week a little brighter after the experience."}
{"text":"Like eating at your incredibly awesome grandmas house. Becky cooks from the heart and you taste it in every dish. Do yourself a favor and stop in!"}
{"text":"My family dined at Sweet Peaches for a Sunday brunch and it was wonderful! Most of them ordered the lumberjack omelet, which I tasted and it was delicious (they all loved it too).  I ordered the lemon curd and berry French toast and it was the best breakfast dish I've ever had.  It was a pretty large portion, but I could have eaten another one it was so good! The side of fruit was fresh and very tasty ...I don't think I've ever eaten a better pineapple.  The atmosphere was so nice and bright on a Sunday morning, I was happy just looking around the place even before my food came.  I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Do you think you've found \"the best brunch place in the city\"? Well if your place is any other than Sweet Peaches you'd be wrong. Because this is the best brunch place!! The sweet peach omelette is like an explosion of goodness with every savory bite. Granola Morning Crunch is as good as any I've had in NYC."}
{"text":"I've not actually had a great meal IN Sweet Peaches but I know they make amazing meals.  Having had their food at several events. Those experiences were exceptional.    So when my girlfriends were thinking of somewhere new to try for brunch, I suggested Sweet Peaches.   The first time I met my friends. We did not have a reservation. I was the one had suggested we try this location. Half the restaurant being empty, we were initially told that our party of three would be seated. Then after some hmmmming and hwwwwing, we were told that we should have made a reservation because we would not actually be able to be seated.    I was a bit taken back. If I hadn't been told we could be seated and then told it wasn't possible, it would not have stung the way it did.  It also felt that the \"advice\" to make a reservation was a little, I'm not sure how to put it, I left feeling scolded like a child.  The second time I met my girlfriends they did make an appointment. While they had additional time to sit through the slowest brunch in our history, I sadly did not. I did however enjoy a cup of coffee with my friends and the opportunity to catch up.   Sadly my French Toast took so long to arrive that by the time it did, I was limited in my time to stay. Which is probably good because it was soggy and not at all what I anticipated in presentation from this establishment. I have it a good poking with my fork and push around. With time running out for me, service taking forever, and the food just look eh, I gave my girlfriend my share of the bill and leaves out.   The restaurant location and experience seems to not match what I'd expect for a brunch spot with such a buzz. The restaurant is very small. Somewhat cramped.  And there is a sort of underlying unpleasant smell to the building.   Staff didn't seem knowledgeable of the menu. (Which is frustrating when I dine because I have food allergies to some very random things that are suddenly trendy to serve.) Personally, I think this chef has a lot to offer but the location and staff is hindering the dining experience from being phenomenal. It would be great to see Sweet Peaches expand and provide a faster, smoother meal service."}
