{"text":"I just moved to Canyon Meadows and Indian food is my favourite. Using Yelp I searched for the closest Indian food location and boom.   Absolutely delicious. I am pretty fuzzy with my indian food but the chicken was tender and the sauces perfect. I had chicken korma, Aloo Gobi, coconut rice and garlic nan bread. I had a great sized meal and still have more than enough for another meal tomorrow. So grateful to have this so close to home. Might be a new place because this is the first review!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Top notch service. Best Indian food in Calgary ... And I've eaten a lot of it here. Try the butter chicken , saffron rice, chickpeas and the lentil soup. You won't be disappointed ! I can't eat the nan bread because of a wheat allergy but my kids devoured it ."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this after reading positive reviews on Yelp. But then I checked their inspection report online. Five inspections since opening in December 2016. All inspections except last one say missing soap or paper towels at the staff washroom handsink (and/or the kitchen). Pretty gross if you think about it, right?  Still tempted though. I really want to try it. Their last report had no violations. I'll wait for the next inspection to see if the food handlers catch on about using hand soap after wiping their butts."}
