{"text":"Ma blonde et moi sommes tombé sur ce petit resto-bar par hasard. Le personnel est chaleureux, le service est rapide et l'ambiance est bonne. Pour un début de soirée un samedi soir, c'était assez tranquille. Leurs sandwichs sont délicieux et font un bon petit repas sur le pouce pour les gens qui n'ont pas beaucoup de temps."}
{"text":"Laika is generally delicious food and excellent service. I ordered the crepes with braised ham and aged cheddar. Yum!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food, great service. Nice cocktails and great atmosphere. A bit pricey but worth it for something different. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"J'ai découvert le Laïka lors du dernier Lunch Break à la Yelp avec Marie-Pier. J'ai souvent passé devant, mais je ne m'y suis jamais arrêté. Je dois dire que quand j'y suis rentrée, j'ai été bien surprise de l'endroit. J'imaginais que c'était un bar de l'extérieur, mais finalement c'est un chouette café sans prétention. Le Laïka a ce feeling très trendy : la faune est belle, le hipster originel de Montréal s'y trouve et on est pile-poil sur la Main!

J'ai pris pour le midi une quesadilla au poulet qui était appétissante : des gros morceaux de poulet, des fèves et du fromage sans que le fromage couvre le tout comme dans les quesadillas que l'on mange trop souvent. J'ai vraiment appréciée ma quesadilla. Leur limonade est excellente aussi (et servie dans un gros gros verre!)

Bref, c'est l'endroit parfait pour un lunch le midi ou encore pour travailler. Avec toutes ses belles personnes et son service parfait, le Laïka a tout pour qu'on s'y sente bien."}
{"text":"Been coming here since the bar opened during the 90's- always a good people watching place. Free solid wifi connection. Cuisine is always interesting and changes regularly.
You can spend hours playing one of these games: 'Spot the Plateau Hippie' or 'Shoot the annoying Hipster' or just talk to the artist hopefuls that their 12 year unfinished movie/theatre/tv script or book will eventually work out..."}

{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had. I want to move to Montreal for a number of reasons, but being able to have weekend brunches at Laika is up there with the most important!"}
{"text":"I love Laika for their awesome food menu, good music, and the fact that I can sit there working for hours and noone minds. I've been going for years and I've always felt good in there, whether alone, with friends, during the day or into the night. 

One of my favourite spots on the Plateau, hands down!"}
{"text":"Brunched here with some friends. While the food was good (nice twist to traditional breakfast fare) the service was atrocious."}
{"text":"J'y étais pour un brunch et j'ai pas apprécié : la nourriture n'était pas a la hauteur, le service non plus même certains ustensiles n'étaient pas propre. Vu les bons commentaires que j'ai lu sur internet, je me dis qu'on est tombé sur une journée ou toute lequipe n'était pas en frome p"}
{"text":"My favourite spot on St-Laurent!

Whenever I'm in town, Laika is my favourite place to catch the vibe of The Main, do a little people watching, enjoy a drink and listen to music from great DJs.

The drink menu is well chosen, the service is consistently good and they do some pretty tasty bistro-style food as well. But for me, the main draw of this place are the excellent DJs and the music lovers who gravitate to this little oasis.

There is wi-fi, and a small terrasse open in the summer out to the street, and a good seasonal menu as well. This is one of those places where you won't find a TV mounted to the wall, which is something I've come to appreciate.

If you're in town, check them out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are on a search for the city's finest Caesar (the drink, not the salad).  

One day after walking up the mountain we decided to sit outside along the Main and people watch and order a couple caesars.  Our waiter promptly came out and asked up how we'd like it, medium or medium-rare, which I thought was pretty clever.  We got sssspicy.  

It was pretty good.  7.5/10  I would have given it an 8 or 8.5/10 IF they had included a garnish other than lemon.  To me a Caesar isn't a Caesar unless it comes with something pickled, meaty or at the very least, y'all, a stalk of celery.  

We didn't eat, but my husband has tried the lamb meatballs before and mentioned them to me on numerous occasions, so clearly they were memorable to him."}
{"text":"Limited dessert menu and okay drinks. Interesting attempt at combining cafe / lounge / art gallery / tapas bar that doesn't quite translate as a whole. Attractive staff and bartenders serving to an older, 30+ clientele. More style over substance and recommended for a night of people watching on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this place has always been overrated. Service is often lukewarm, and the food definitely leaves something to be desired. The menu is generally unimaginative, and the quality is very inconsistent.

In general, Laika seems to subsist off of its location, being a convenient place for people to meet for a drink, quick bite, or casual brunch (I've *never* felt rushed by the staff to clear my table).

However, if you're really into electronic music, they often have a live DJ, which makes for a nice ambiance if you're into that kind of thing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in the city to mix eating and drinking with work. It's easy to stay there all day. It's warm and the music is nice - usually techno house beats. A really great spot for meetings, too.

Staff is nice - they don't bug you and they seem fine with you staying there for hours though they seem to wonder wtf people do on their laptops all day long."}
{"text":"Very booster spot but gosh check out their breakfast specials. Make the guy take the board of the wall and bring it to your table. You will love their breakfast creativity. Don't forget to stop by the international presse shop next door on your way out - I found Mongolian fashion magazines there, beat that."}
{"text":"Laika has always been cool. It's never had a decrease in crowd quality like most of Montreal's nightlife spots. When you go to Laika, you can expect consistency - up-beat electro music mixed by a live DJ starting around 10pm, a short menu of very decent food valid until 10pm, and tasty drinks made by a bartender that clearly respects his ingredients.

Laika is simple, and that's exactly what I like about it. It's not trying, it just \"is\". The waitress might not be the most experienced at opening bottles of Prosecco but she makes up for it with sweetness. The bartender won't make you the complicated drink that's currently trending around town but he'll make you a damn good classic cocktail. The DJ has fun doing his thing and moving to the music. People are hanging and talking over mixed drinks and beer (and, our case, Prosecco - $34) and there's likely someone tucked away in a corner typing away at a project that's surely super artsy. And that's all ok. Everyone's doing their own thing. And yes, it is a hipster hangout, but even the hipsters at Laika don't feel like they have to prove their hipsterdom to the world around them- they just seem to want to have a good time with their friends. Cheers to that.

I just have one criticism - the 10pm cutoff for ordering food is ridiculously strictly reinforced. I tried to order a cheese plate at 10:08pm and was told I was too late by what seemed to be a manager. Really? Relax, buddy. Have a drink.

Despite that surprising mini let-down, I like Laika. I'm glad it's only a fifteen minute walk from my place. And in the summer? Snag a seat on their fun and totally intrusive sidewalk terrasse to enjoy the great people-watching. You want a chill night somewhere that's more than just a relaxed bar? Laika.

{"text":"This restaurant is tucked into a larger commercial building.  The space includes a picture window opening onto St. Lawrence, and stretches into a long narrow space.  I sat directly at the bar, by myself, where the dishwasher competed with the music to see which machine was the loudest.

I ordered the roast beef sandwich.  The sandwich was piled up with thin slices of beef, roasted red peppers, and some cheese.  It was then squished in a panini press and served piping hot.  I asked for the mustard to be omitted, and it was.  There was a small cup of very tiny, very sour dill gherkins beside the sandwich.  I ate one, I am not a fan of dill pickles but the sourness was a nice accompaniment."}
{"text":"très bien et le manger est très bon tout en écoutant les DG"}
{"text":"I have only been here twice, once for brunch and another for a quick glass of afternoon beer while waiting for a friend. The set up its simple and it seems there is a lot of regulars. Young and hipster of Montreal that seem to know each other including the staff.
Brunch was great, the food is tasty and you can taste the fresh ingredient. I enjoyed it very much and would like to come back."}
{"text":"I've always loved this spot, its location on busy St. Laurent, its windows wide open in the summertime, its DJs spinning lounge-y, funky house, the free wireless, the good cafe lattes, the lunch specials, the sitting for hours and reading. I try to hang out here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town. Either for drinks with friends to the tune of any of the great DJs or for a little work session in the afternoon. The food is always very good, if a bit pricey. Try the soups if you're on a budget, they're always great. I love their grilled cheese remixed and the daily specials are always creative. The bar service is impeccable."}
{"text":"Laïka is a wonderful, eclectic place that can suit any mood, or any outing. I never really plan on going here; I always just end up popping in and I'm never disappointed.

They have wonderful brunch (poached eggs with lardons, potatoes, creamy béchamel sauce and buttery, crispy baguette toast, or eggs baked in an avocado half with a spicy tomato sauce, yum!), great cappuccinos (with sweetened foam and cinnamon on top, how did they know that's exactly what I like?), a great tapas, lunch and dinner menu, happy hour from 4-8, and a great, cozy, candlelit lounge vibe at night. 

Great electronic tunes emanate from the DJ booth all day long, suited to the vibe, atmosphere and itme of day (although I have been there in the evening working on my laptop, and experienced the strange transition from café hangout spot to more of a upbeat lounge via more upbeat tunes).

Not too pricy, always tasty, although I've never found the staff to be too friendly or attentive. The journey to find the bathroom is daunting the first time, as you adventure into the industrial bowels of the building."}
{"text":"We came to Laika our first night as we were walking on Saint-Laurent. With so many bars and choices, we landed upon Laika for its clean interior and the cool DJ playing music. 

DRINKS: Popular cocktails, but unfortnuately, my cocktail with Pimms seemed to be very light. Maybe that's how it's done here, but I do like a heartier drink for that price of $9. It was not bad by any means, but I was hoping for a stronger drink. 

ATMOSPHERE: Chill, laid back, and cool DJ playing at the right volume. 

Overall, this place is a for sure nice atmosphere. We did not get any food as we came in pretty late (around midnight to 1 AM), but the service was slower, but we did not mind as we were just relaxing. Maybe if I come back, i'll try the food, the pictures on Yelp sure do look good!"}
{"text":"Studied with a small group of classmates at this spot while enjoying some delicious food! 
This was the first place that came to are attention when picking out a meet up. 
The food was great, chill atmosphere and the music added to this experience. 
I recommend Laika to a lot of my friends!"}
{"text":"Parfait pour un verre et un morceau après le boulot. Staff sympa. Musique branché par dj sur place. Ca ne lève plus autant qu'avant..."}
{"text":"Un bon petit bar et resto de quartier, bien situé à l'angle St Laurent et Duluth, pas très visible de la rue d'ailleurs, il faut savoir que c'est là!
Ambiance cool et décontractée, beaucoup y vont dans la journée pour le travail ou étudier sur leur ordi, il y a aussi des rendez-vous d'affaires, et on peut aussi y aller pour prendre un café, en terrasse l'été
La bouffe est très bonne à chaque fois, j'y suis allée 3 fois et n'ai jamais été déçue :)
Les entrées et desserts sont aussi à tester! Ils valent le détour!
Parfois, il y a un DJ (le samedi soir il me semble?)
Parfois, la musique peut être un peu forte
En tout cas, c'est une bonne ambiance garantie, et ça peut être une place pour faire des rencontres!"}
{"text":"I liked it.

Full disclosure: all I ordered was coffee.  Black and strong, like my favourite civil rights leaders.  It was good.  But that's not really what this review is about.

My partner in crime ordered some crepe thingamabob.  She claimed it was good.  Service was sometimes non-existent but when it existed, was good.  However, if you intend on hanging out with friends, macking on someone, or just studying in here, this is your place.  We overstayed our welcome and stayed 20 minutes past closing time, even though we had long ago downed our non-alcoholic drinks.  The staff said nothing about it and were nothing but courteous.  I'm sure in their heads they loathed us, but the point is that they didn't say anything about it, and I'm going to come back because of it.

It's pretty comfortable.  A little dim at night, so don't worry, if you bring a date here they won't see all those craters in your face.  There was free wifi but I'm too poor to own an iPhone (let alone buy one) so I just watched other people use theirs.  For free.  Must be nice.  There are also a ton of weird, surreal videos playing on this giant screen in the corner.  It's really distracting when you're trying to have a serious conversation but also really, really, really cool.  I like-a Laika (yes, I just wrote that)."}
{"text":"This wonderful lounge based in what seems like the heart of the coolest centre of Montreal (st laurent) was always one of my favorite places....

I remember being there 10 years ago and enjoying its atmosphere and crowd.

Recently revisited there with a few friends over a few days of a  week in August. The place still has a great atmosphere and incredible food. 

We ate at bruncha and dinner and lunch. All the food specials were great. My favorite being the brunch menu with its inspiring avocado infused dishes/omelettes 

Great patio seating too right on st laurent. You can people watch all day while sipping on a Tom Collins or a Vodka and Soda"}
{"text":"Place découverte lors d'un Lunch Break, le cadre est vraiment agréable et classe sont pour autant être trop tape a l'oeil.

Le service a été rapide, j'ai pris un sandwich au vegepaté qui été bon sans être excellent. 

Pour se retrouver avec une bonne gang d'amis pour jaser c'est une bonne place, même si je ne l'ai pas testé dans ce contexte la (on était 3), meme si on a bien jaser tout de même =) ."}
{"text":"Accidentally stopped here and ended up having the loveliest afternoon. The food is delicious. Ambience pleasant. Staff most definitely attentive. The owner Phil might be the coolest guy in Montreal. We had espressos, coffee , cheese platter (delicious), champagne...to top it off it was our 1 year anniversary and kindly Phil obliged to play our wedding dance, The Very Thought of You. To say we spent a few lovely hours is putting it mildly. This place and Phil are gems. Thank you."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks after dinner. It's a bit loungy, but it was a cool atmosphere. We were seated right in front of a DJ, and I felt like I could hear the soundtrack of my life playing... because it was so loud. Still, good beer and good ambience."}
{"text":"Mon chum aurait mis 4, donc disons plutôt 3,5 !

Bonne ambiance (dommage qu'ils aient changé de place le DJ qui est maintenant caché au fond), et déco très vieille Amérique. Les tables proches de la vitre sont rigolottes : on est au niveau des pieds des gens :) 

Niveau repas, très original ! Un peu trop peut-être pour moi (pas fan des avocats chauds) mais bon et surtout, ce sont des plat que l'on ne trouve nulle par ailleurs !

Bref, un bon brunch original dans un endroit bien posé !"}
{"text":"Place parfaite pour une pinte de Cheval Blanc avec du Wi-Fi Gratuit. La bouffe est pas si mal en plus. Prix très abordable et en plein milieu de St-Laurent."}
{"text":"Très sympa. Le restaurant ne paye pas de mine de prime à bord, mais on finit par se laisser emporter par l'atmosphère vivante et animée. Les petites tables rondes dispersées un peu partout, entourées de petit fauteuil un peu vieillot, vintage, mais malgré tout assez confortable. Ceci mis à part, la nourriture y est excellente. le service est très bon, et très aimable, et j'insiste sur la qualité du cheesecake qui est divin ! C'est un endroit parfait pour venir y travailler la journée, prendre un café, ou déjeuner entre amis."}
{"text":"Le Laïka est un bar de la rue Saint-Laurent qui a cela de particulier qu'il est toujours ouvert, ou presque. Contrairement aux autres débits de boissons, qui ouvrent le plus souvent en après-midi, on peut aller déjeuner au Laïka à partir de 8h30, y prendre un café ou encore y diner. Établissement multiforme, le Laïka peut se prêter à un multitudes d'occasions. J'y suis allé souvent le soir, alors qu'il y avait des lancements et, d'autre fois, pour des rendez-vous le midi ou en matinée. L'endroit se prête bien aux rendez-vous, puisqu'il y a là une borne Wi-Fi fil et qu'on peut ainsi aller gratuitement sur Internet. Le café y est bon, les tapas aussi. Finalement, malgré que l'endroit soit toujours rempli de clients, le service est toujours impeccable."}
{"text":"Decent but tiny mixed drink. Priced ok, good beer selection. Cant comment on the vibe because I went on a completely dead night, but the environment seemed very nice."}
{"text":"Cadre sympa et bonne musique.  La cuisine a été juste correcte à mon goût. Je n'ai pas aimé la sauce avec mon tataki et la personne qui nous a servi manquait cruellement de professionnalisme et de tact. Dommage je serai bien revenu si je n'avais pas été decue"}
{"text":"Service is always spacey but sexy, food and beer are fine and reasonably priced, free wifi, nice sunken spot with giant windows on St Laurent corner  Duluth (lovely) with constantly great music from local djs. Bonus, sit here for hours drinking coffee or beer, no one will bother you."}
{"text":"I love Laïka. I have been many times at many times throughout the day and the vibe is always different. 

Most recently I visited for Nuit Blanche. It was a welcome respite from the snowy cold. Cool projections on the wall and good music with a dance vibe. It was an official Nuit Blanche venue but to be honest I couldn't actually tell the difference between the night in question and any other night at Laïka - other than the projections. Always cool. 

This an excellent spot for a lunch meeting with a colleague, catch-up drinks with an old friend, a coffee date or even a rowdy night out with a group. This bar is like a chameleon!"}
{"text":"Je viens ici surtout pour mes brunchs de fin de semaine. J'adore cet endroit pour les raisons suivantes (en vrac) : Menu inspirant, innovateur et de qualité. Bouffe savoureuse. Ambiance relax. Service rapide et courtois. Belle grande vitrine qui donne sur le boulevard Saint-Laurent et qui illumine l'endroit d'une belle lumière naturelle. Jamais besoin de faire la file pour déjeuner car on n'est pas sur le Platô ici ;-) Le Wifi gratuit. Le café est bon. Le kiosque à journaux juste à côté permet d'y acheter le journal avant ou après le brunch.   

Le soir, l'endroit se transforme en bar. Un DJ live nous fait jouer une musique à tendance Chill. L'ambiance est cool, la gente féminine est jolie et on arrive à s'entendre parler tout en prenant un verre relax. Je vous ai dit que j'adore ?"}
{"text":"Stopped by Laika there around 11pm one Saturday night went for an espresso after dining out with a friend. It was my first visit and definitely will be back as the atmosphere and espresso were amazing! 
The astmosphere is cozy, cool, laid back yet rockin at the same time and there are really great large windows up front that add to the ambiance 
The service was top notch even though Laika was quite packed at that hour on a Saturday night.


Looking forward to stopping by on a weekend for brunch as well."}
{"text":"I was excited for the brunch here as it looks delicious... But after 41 minutes of waiting I am getting hangry. Also, where is my Caesar??

UPDATE: The brunch was really tasty and well made... But the 1 hour wait for our food was really unacceptable.

 The waiter did not check in with us for so long and said that the receipt did not print to the kitchen - understandable but how long does a table wait for a check in/food? Surely not 40 minutes until we have to go UP and ask about it. 

A round of drinks was bought for us but... Would not recommend no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"So I went to Laika on Sunday for brunch not remembering beforehand that I've actually been there before. The fact that it was not memorable tells me it was neither amazing nor horrible. We sat outside which was nice on a hot summer day. I started off wit a mimosa followed by a bloody Cesaer. It took awhile before we got our drinks. I ordered the pailasson (Lardons, pleurotes, épinards, oignons rôtis et emmenthal).  It would have been really good if the two eggs were more runny but alas they were overcooked.
 :( I really liked the crunchiness of the dish though. I tried my friends mergez jalapeno omelette and although it was good we both preferred my dish."}
{"text":"Beau lounge/café, beaucoup de choix de bières et cocktails, grandes baies vitrées donnant sur le Boulevard St-Laurent, une belle place pour sortir entre amis ou travailler en journée."}
{"text":"It's a bar so for a drink it's really fine. However the brunch was disgusting. we paid 20$ each for a tiny plate and we got sick :( Worst brunch experience so far in Montreal."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service!!
We were specifically told it was because we ordered Montreal a table special menu we could actually eat there.

Food and music were A1 though..."}
{"text":"Bon assiette de brunch, bonne association des saveurs mais un peu fade au final.il y a l'idée mais il manque le petit truc qui fait tilt. Prix plutot raisonnable. Service un peu lent mais très sympa ! J'ai apprécié mais pas été transcendée non plus."}
{"text":"Vendredi midi, heure lunch, c'est le rush. En plus, il y a un assez grand groupe qui est venu luncher en gang. Party de Noël de bonne heure?

Je voulais venir m'installer pour travailler quelques heures et pour une petite réunion. Même avec la foule, on m'a trouvé un petit coin sur le bar qui est parfait. J'ai le bruit de l'ambiance en arrière plan, je peux regarder les cuisiniers travailler quand j'ai besoin d'une petite pause et on m'a servi mon repas dès qu'il était près puisque je suis juste là.

J'avais envie de sucré et j'ai choisi le pain perdu, pommes et cannelle. Oh mon dieu! C'est riche et dense, plein de fruits et super goûteux sans être trop sucré. Parfait pour prendre son temps et manger quelques bouchées entre quelques mots. J'ai hâte d'y retourner pour goûter aux autres plats que j'ai vu les cuisiniers préparer."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.
Beer prices are decent compared to other places in MTL. And keep in mind that there is a live Dj playing. So, thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Super solid choice for a chill evening with friends on St Laurent. Never overly crowded, you can be sure that you'll have a table. Great wine list and surprisingly interesting and delicious menu. Would be great for a first date or catching up with friends."}
