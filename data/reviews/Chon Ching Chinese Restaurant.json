{"text":"It's really appetizing to listen to the chef hack lung butter as he is preparing your food."}
{"text":"I frequent this place every few weeks for lunch. Great sesame chicken and fried rice. Good prices and big portions. I get two meals out of the lunch portion. The dinner portion is huge and gave me about 3 meals worth of food."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. The hot and sour soup had little to no flavor, tastes like broth. General Tso's chicken (supposed to be spicy) tasted more like sweet and sour chicken. 

The food was ready fast and staff friendly. If your looking for some basic Chinese food then it's ok. But looking for real flavor, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Good lunch deals and friendly customer service. I was greeted upon entry and they set right away to make my food. Would definitely come back here."}
