{"text":"False advertisement! They label themselves as \"All You Can Eat\" but we were cutoff after only a few rounds of ordering nigiri. We attempted to order more but the waitress said there was a 3 round limit. We questioned it because we definitely surpassed 3 rounds and when we told her this you could clearly see she felt uncomfortable cutting us off. The waitress was really nice but we think the sushi chef had her cut us off as it seemed like they were making up limitations on the fly. There were not sign posted anywhere stating that there was a 3 round limit on nigiri. All in all, the food was descent. Definitely had better but it wasn't bad. The soft shell crab was really good as was the Hot Crunch Roll. Probably wouldn't be back though."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I had In a while !  It took for ever to be seated and the drinks were so expensive and my sushi tasted old as if the fish wasn't fresh"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on the weekend so it was 27.99 for all you can eat with a 15% gratuity added. They explained it all at the beginning so it wasn't a surprise. The all you can eat includes at least appetizers and sushi (all we ordered) and is an hour limit. Sushi is pretty good quality and the rolls are interesting as well as your typical sushi rolls. Between two of us we had 6 , 8 piece rolls and a small apptetizer. Restaurant was clean with professional staff. Overall very impressed."}
{"text":"Try dropping a group of 9 post-college kids into Vegas after some tiring travel and getting everyone to agree on food... thank goodness for Rock & Roll. It's not a long walk from the Strip and the AYCE sushi is much better than most things you'll regret buying in a mega-hotel-casino.  The rolls are well sized for sharing, but they do skew towards being overly embellished. Maybe I should just say that if you like your rolls drizzled with sauce and fried, come eat here. Edamame, miso soup, etc. are included in your AYCE meal, but why fill up on that?  The space itself is nice, and the service is friendly and prompt. I might have preferred Sushi Mon, but as a tourist, I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"My son was excited when saw the sushi place for all you can eat($25.98 adult and kids same price),but there were different impression for walk in and after we ate the first around. The waitess star to changed face.   I'm agree with Saudra and Trina. This is the worst restaurent and bad service never had in my entire life vacation times. A waitress was very Rude Rude!!(I belived she is owner) Food not too good and you can't order the one we want.(what kind of all you can eat should changed for limited eater can eat) My son not even full she already give us bill for paid seem like want to kick us out to restaurent. Not even that 15% tip automatic add in bill (I will not mind give them more tips if there is good services!!!) For this kind of all you can eat.\"Too good to be true\" LOL  I will not recommened anyone go there. ever and ever go there"}
{"text":"This place seriously sucks. Service sucks, sushi owner is rude  as hell and super slow at making sushi. I've never heard of one hour all you can eat. This place os just bad, period. Gratuitt Is Included for parties of FOUR and more. That ridiculous. I will never come back here. Take it from someone who eats sushi all the time, this place isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I focus my reviews largely on AYCE sushi. My tip would be to pay the 8 buck uber ride and go over to Yama, Sakana or Sushi Way.  The quality and selection and freshness here is relatively poor compared to what you get just east of there. I was alone in there for lunch, and the staff was relatively hostile with me. Apparently, they took issue with the volume of my selections on the ordering card, scolded me and edited it to their satisfaction."}
{"text":"Incredibly poor service( , they don't tell you when AYCE menu items are not available, which were all my favorites, and the quality was below-average Midwest level taste - which should NOT be the comparable level when in Vegas.  But the rolls are creative and good, it's just that they are 12 pc rolls and if you order more than 1 you can't eat anything else you're so full.  For $30 total (mandatory 18% gratuity) it's not the worst I've ever been too, just know you are going to get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to give this place a try.  The sushi was just average.  I've had much better at places located off the strip.  My main complaint is that besides bringing me my food, the server never came back to the table.  My water glass remained empty.  She finally came back when she saw that we finished ( we didn't do all you can eat, it was a light lunch), she cleared the table, brought the bill and still didn't at least offer to refill our glasses.  I was completed insulted that she included gratuity on our bill.  I have no problems tipping and usually tip a lot more than the standard.  If you are going to add gratuity, at least earn it.  Won't be back there again.  There are too many other places in Las Vegas which much better and cheaper food, with great service and quality."}
{"text":"Chef was ok, server was bitch. She was wearing red glasses and little bit fat. We ordered sushi.. It was horrible and rice was too much so I told her its too much rice.. I'm Korean.. She's Korean and all of sudden she said I have a bad attitude...wtf.. Hahahahahahahahahahahaha I said how can you do this to your customer.. She said I don't care I'm in charge of this restaurant...wtf.. And then she charged 15% for the tip..it was freakin mandatory..wtf...  I never gonna go back because that fat and old lady (whose in charge) server.   ."}
{"text":"I happened on the first review and hoped for the best. After showing up around 10 pm for a late dinner we were slightly concerned to be the only patrons. But then again at a Sushi bar this definitely has it's benefits.  The fish was fresh the service was great and the price was reasonable. If you are doing AYCE for 25$ (dinner) skip the dynamite it was ok but the seafood/mayo concoction was served over salad instead of rice and detracted from the nigiri where your appetite would be better focused. Liked the albacore! Money well spent."}
{"text":"did not care for this place.....no one eating thnge when we arrived.   waitress had hard time understandign english and speaking english.....first she said it's all you can eat for one price  then we were charged for each item....  gratuity of 20% automatically charged .....never again...  food was too salty and not very generous portions.....  go to millers alehouse instead more food for less..."}
{"text":"I won't call myself a sushi snob, and since my work has taken me to many cities -- with that I have tried out many Japanese restaurants so I have some expectations on the food I get and the price I pay.   I'd say R&R has served up a pretty good selection of AYCE at a decent price, and I have been back a few times because the food is good. I'd skip the rolls and go for the nigiri and some special orders. So far my favorite dishes include sweet shrimp (can only order once), baked mussels, soft shell crab, salmon roe and albacore.  Gratuity of 18% is added to the bill though, and so far I am satisfied with their promptness of service. You can always spend more at the Strip for similar food, for me I'd take the short walk from Wynn to R&R to satisfy my appetite for sushi"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good. The rice could be a little tighter. Good service."}
{"text":"Customer service suck !!! I would like to give 3 stars to the foods , not too bad , price and foods are average ! But the customer service totally ruin it . Seriously the waitress just ruin it ."}
{"text":"We came in and sat down and got no attention from any of the waitresses. I attempted to walk up to the counter my self to get a menu and the main waitress was so rude and rolled her eyes at me when I asked to get a menu. Our friends who got their before us said you weren't allowed to order off the main menu you were only allowed to order off the All You Can Eat menu. Our friends said the food was terrible and the service while they were there was not up to par! Do not go to this restaurant, they are rude, roll their eyes and have no service qualities! If I could give a 0 star I would"}
{"text":"All u can eat. Fast service. Very good attitude from sever. Not best sushi but better prices then at hotel."}
{"text":"This place sucks. They make you feel bad about ordering and they watch you how much you eat. I was disgusted and will never return."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi. The service was prompt and the server friendly. Not the snazziest location as the strip mall it is in is a bit run down. I am from outside of Vegas but if I visit again I will come again."}
{"text":"We saw the sign advertising $20 for all-you-can-eat sushi and were a bit skeptical but decided to give it a try. Oh, yeah! Rock n Roll Sushi serves some of the best sushi I've had. I tend to go for the sashimi so I didn't try many of the rolls. Everything was good but the mackerel was incredible.   Rock n Roll Sushi is located in a small strip mall so parking is easy. It's right off The Strip between The Riviera and The Wynn."}
{"text":"I created an account just so I could review this restaurant and make it known. I'm a Los Angeles local who eats a LOT of sushi and was pleasantly surprised by Rock n Roll. It was deceptively empty, which we thought was a bad sign... couldn't have been more wrong! My friend and I both got the all you can eat lunch special which included everything on their sushi menu, a rarity since it was pretty large. You can, of course, order the rolls seperately but I will soon convince you otherwise.  The sushi chef, Kiyo, was not only very competent but also very personable, I love being able to chat and joke around with a sushi chef at the bar. He was patient when we asked questions about the rolls we were not familiar with, made very successful recommendations when he found out what we liked and was very accommodating for my onion allergy.   We sampled pretty much the entire menu... Honestly, we gorged ourselves and found every item served to us to be not only good quality, but pretty damn tasty. Even the simple items like the baked mussels and nigiri sushi were done well and not just run of the mill. My recommendations are the baked salmon roll and the self named rock n roll, which was a fresh, bright roll perfect for the desert heat.  Please note, that  Rock n Roll has rules for the all you can eat regarding charging for uneaten items, like most other \"all you can eat\"ers that I've been too, but it wasn't necessary since I was basically licking the plate right in front of Kiyo. Also, note that there is a minimum gratuity based on the size of your party but based on the service and good time I gave much more than the 15% for a party under 4 people.  I could not recommend this place enough and even though I am not a local we've decided that we're going to be going back there a few more times during our vacation. It's sad that my new favorite sushi place is not even in the same state. I did seriously ask Kiyo to move to LA, but for some reason he just laughed it off..."}
{"text":"When I was visiting Las Vegas for NAB show, someone recommended me to go this restaurant. So i went to the restaurant to have a dinner with 7 people, and we ordered some sushi and beer. It is \"all you can eat\" restaurant but they did not give us the menu, and even they did not answer it . When we finally asked them to get more sushi, they were acting like so rude. A korean woman kept saying things like they want to kick us out. I felt so bad about it so we decided to go out. REALLY RUDE ATTITUDE. I have never seen this kind of restaurant before. We ordered food three times? And it wasn't much for 7 people. We did not leave food but they just didn't want to serve it anymore. The Korean woman kept saying things until we paid the bill. We paid almost $30 each  for all you can eat sushi (but it wasn't ) and I didn't want to give them lots of tips but they gave us a bill already included tips (over 20%). I am not a person who doesn't pay tips. I usually pay around 20% or more. However for this case, they were almost kick us out so I didn't want to pay that much. I didn't want to argue with them so I didn't say anything about it.   Please DON'T GO to this restaurant if you don't want to eat food with the WORST service."}
{"text":"This place does not have curb appeal, or any appeal once you walk in but the sushi tasted really good with no complaints. I only gave it 4 stars because it has a lot to be desired as far as appearances go.  They have their A rating from the health department displayed.  The service was very quick. The Dragon and Vegas roles were huge.  The All-you-can-eat is AYCE within 3 orders and there is 15% added for parties of 4 OR LESS, to clarify a previous review."}
{"text":"Honestly even one star is overrating the quality of the food and service here. The food is honestly not that bad but the rice to fish ratio is ridiculous. We made a comment to the waitress who is apparently \"in charge\"  she was rude the moment we stepped inside. She talks back and she has no respect for the customers. She's Korean but she started talking trash about Korean people and stereotyping us making comments that was not appropriate or necessary.  I don't know why the own would pay someone like that to work. It was completely empt for the hour wee were there, probably because that lady is so rude and bitchy to all of the customers. Just e tone of her voice and attitude made me want to punch her in the face I never get so mad at a server to the point of having to put her on blast on yelp but for those of you who are interested in eating here so ahead and take a look at her pic she's about late 40s early fifties.  I don't know why ey charge a 15percent gratuity for people when the service sucks balls. The owner needs to get a new worker and train them to have better customer service because he just lost 12 customers.  This place deserves no stars"}
{"text":"The service in this place was excellent. The food was great and particularly Mia was amazing with her wonderful service and attitude. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible service and owner tried to double charge us on the items. Double check the receipt if you really have to eat here."}
{"text":"This may be the only asian restaurant that ive been to where the service is not horrible. I am totally shocked at the bad reviews about service. We go about every 2 months as soon as you walk thru the door someone from somewhere in the restaurant  welcomes us and comes over to seat us. It can get crowded on the weekends, we like to sit at the bar and just keep handing our orders to the \"sushi master\" our selves. The waitresses are very attentive from making sure our drinks & water stay full, which are canned sodas , i never understood that so its not free on the refills, and ready to take your next order if your having the AYCE .The food is very fresh, the red bean ice cream that we cant find anywhere else is delicious. From beginning to end our dining experience has always been pleasant."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price, nice alternative to the big names around"}
{"text":"I had seen some decent reviews on this place so I decided to hit it up. Not impressed. Was kind of expensive for the AUCE option, $25 a person as the selection looked like it was not very good. I went with ala cart and was not impressed with anything. It was all very sweet with sauces and just not high quality. Would not repeat and I should know better hitting a place on the strip like that! LOL.. worth a try.."}
{"text":"So, first things first, very very good sushi.  Two of us got the all you can eat deal (~$26/person).  It's not too bad as some of the rolls we got are about $13 each normally.  We got about nine rolls total (split between the two of us) and only made it to round two before we got full.   One waitress said it was all you can eat in three rounds and another said all you can eat as long as there isn't waste.  The service was okay to disappointing; one of the servers was a bit rude.  While tipping is traditionally a reward for good service, this restaurant just tacks on a tip (which in fairness they do tell you about before sitting down).  It's really no surprise that they do this, given the quality of service.  What is surprising is that their \"rules\" for tipping are clearer than their rules for \"all you can eat\"*.  The irony is that we probably would have ordered fewer rolls if it were a more traditional all you can eat where there is no pressure to order in three rounds.  While we did finish everything, apparently you get charged for left overs (like at other all you can eat sushi restaurants). Overall, not a bad place to eat, but consider this your informed consent :P  *Well, maybe \"all you can eat\", maybe \"all you can eat in just three rounds\""}
{"text":"What sucks the most about this place is that they include their tip, even tho they have shitty service they are rude and get mad if you ask for something never coming back! Lesson learned look on yelp first!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome!!!! The waitress was super nice!! Great little hole in the wall!! Will come again when in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"I had some mixed feelings at first about this place, because of some of the reviews. I was really happy with my service. This was my husband and I first time here and it was great. It wasn't crowded at all. We went around noon. The owner was friendly and suggested rolls for us to have. This place isn't expensive at all. The food was AMAZING!! Looking forward to our next visit to Vegas and to come here!"}
{"text":"Sushi is not the best. Very poor service and very over priced!!! Never eating here. We had not even finished the first round when we were asked to order the second round."}
{"text":"I am surprised about the negative reviews, my experience was largely positive. The sushi is a 4 star. The waitress could have been a little nicer.   The reason I give it 5 stars is that you REALLY get your money's worth. All you can eat for $26. Actually it is not really AYCE; you get 3 rounds of ordering which is more than enough for me. They add a 15% gratuity, which I would have tipped anyway.   Bottom line: for $26 you get a LOT of sushi, and I will definitely be back when I am in town next time."}
{"text":"Terrible place!  They need to find manners big time.  And there whole rule about all you can eat and if someone eats a piece they get charged.  Not a cool place."}
{"text":"I know people may get weirded out when they see AYCE sushi places that are not big name restaurants or connected to a hotel, but this place is delicious! I would eat here again! The service is great, the atmosphere is family friendly, and the food is so tasty. The lady is so motherly and sweet! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Worst possible restaurant experience I've ever had in my life! AVOID this place at ALL COSTS!! Do Not EAT Here! You've been warned!   I'm very honest and polite as are my friends.  So I'll start with the good.  Food wasn't that bad for expecting fresh Fish in the middle of the desert.  The Vegas roll was pretty good.  Nothing here was great or worth craving for - but not bad.  The bad- we sit down and chubby waitress (don't know their names) comes up and says buffet is $27 a person no drink included - that's pretty high, but we were pretty high and wanted sushi- ok let's go for it.    Red flag one- it's not a buffet - they make each roll one by one- although 4 people ordered - they only bring out one roll at a time. And take about 7-10 mins in between each one they bring out. We had munchies- these rolls lasted about 47 seconds and then another excruciating 10 mins before the next one arrives.  Mind you - other than for us there was just 1 other couple. For you simpletons out there quick math - 6 customers total - at least 8 staff working.  Speed should not be a problem when there is no cooking involved. Salmon meat was white, shouldn't salmon be pinkish?  Red flag 2: after 2nd roll and after Being there for 20 mins waiting for more food our waitress decides it's time for a \"shift change\" and makes us pay NOW instead of at the end of our meal like normal- okay weird but whatever- just get me more Sushi!! She takes our money and tips and waitress number 2 arrives.  Old Korean looking lady with evil eyes! Super scary and sketch, says \"l herp u now.\" But the first waitress never leaves- they just both start walking by and staring every 2 mins like we're stealing the salt or something. What happened to the shift change?? And they forced us to pay a 15% tip even tho our meal isn't done yet and definitely not going well so far! But we were hungry and thought being the evil money hungry witches that they are- they would some how give us better service now knowing we're not cheap and have already paid! Boy was I wrong....  Red flag 3: were done eating after an hour and have had only like 5-6 rolls total between 4 people and just dropped like $120 + tips ready to leave - the waitress says u didn't finish the last 3 pieces were going to need to charge you for that! How the hell can you charge for the same food twice?! I already paid for it.  I can't take it to go.  I don't want no more of your 40 min mid grade sushi and you already took me for over $120 and you want more money??? This place is a GIANT scam! Do not ever go!!  If that wasn't bad enough- they caused a huge scene and acted like we didn't want to pay for our meal! For leaving .49 cents worth of sushi!! And the old lady with the evil eyes starts yelling in her evil sounding tone and her bug eyes until the owner retrieves her witch. That lady alone is reason not to go here- haven't been able to close my eyes for 3 days.  #mighthaveplacedacurseonus #idonteventhinktheyrejapanese"}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about here.  Too much money for fair sushi. They add a 15% regardless of the group size."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  It has an AYCE option which worked well for me since I was starving @ the time."}
{"text":"AYCE for $21 lunch or $26 dinner. Decent sushi. Not the best quality but a large selection and friendly staff.  No one else in the restaurant for a Saturday lunch."}
{"text":"Similar to most all the other AYCE Sushi Joints around Vegas.  Same fish - okay quality.  This place had a bit smaller selection than other places as they were missing Tamago of all things.  Location is in a cheezy little strip mall area.  Dining room was stark and cold but not unpleasant as was the service.  They only let you go 3 rounds on the AYCE but that's more than enough for most people (they don't want people camping out which is understandable.)  I did note that she didn't bring the sheet back after round 2 but my stomach was hurting by then.    Cooked food menu is very limited and quality is no different than a Japanese Counter Service place but with table service prices of $13+.  I wouldn't come here for anything other than AYCE which does include appetizers, teriyaki chicken, etc. etc.    I would give them 4 stars but I think they put a little too much rice with their sushi to fill you up on rice.  It's the normal amount of rice.  But some places, like Sushi Twister over on the East side of Vegas give you close to the same size pieces of fish with less rice so you don't get full as quickly.  Overall, if you are in the North Strip area and really hungry, craving some Japanese food at a reasonable price, this is a decent choice."}
{"text":"Sushi all you can eat at Las Vegas Strip  Korean own but very good  Japanese sushi in reasonable price.  I will go back again."}
{"text":"I'm just here right now ! Never ever come back again ! Poor service !!! This is all you can eat and the price is fancy already , they auto include 15% tips!  But the most important thing is , we two people only order 3 plates first and finish them.  The lady come to me and ask us \" are you guys done \".  I said not yet but she already prepare a check to us already !!! My hubby still need to order , and her attitude is sooo rude , and tell us they don't have this they don't have that.  After we finish order , the lady told us she will make one plate after we finish one plate.  And we can see she don't want to make it.   She asked us many times \" are you done ?\" \"Do you still want it ?\"   My god , this is all you can eat , we only eat for not enough half and hour and seems like you come to ask us many times to leave.   Actually your store is empty and nobody coming.   Bad experience in this store !! Highly don't recommend you guys to come try it.  Btw , the food here is not fresh and not even taste like it is.   All the sushi the same taste even though they are from different kind of fish.  I don't even want to give one star."}
{"text":"On vacation in Vegas from Toronto (Canada). Good quality for the most part, but don't go expecting sashimi options. We're spoiled in Toronto, I suppose - since it's always a given that AYCE includes a full sashimi offering, rather than just rolls and sushi. Also lacks variety in cooked items. Lastly, be aware: they wait for you to finish each item before bringing out the next. ...missing AYCE sushi from Toronto!   Two adult AYCE plus a bottle of wine: $113 total, gratuity included (they force it)."}
{"text":"Ehhh it's a hole in the wall sushi place in the middle of the desert selling fish.... What do you expect? One of my biggest pet peeves is when a restaurant serves you soda in a can. I mean come on, pay Coke to get the machines. Other then that the sushi was actually pretty good, wasn't the best but wasn't the worst either. Staff was very attentive, almost too attentive like at times I felt they were hovering over me. But I guess that's better then ignoring us. Overall, wasn't really impressed but wasn't disappointed either. If you don't feel like spending a ton in one of the casinos for sushi this place will do."}
{"text":"After we were completely ignored at the Indian place in this strip mall (if I wrote one star reviews of places that I didn't get served it deserved it), my lady and I decided to check out this sushi place we have seen on the sightseeing bus the day before in the section of The Strip between the two batches of casinos.  I didn't have high expectations and, in the end, it's a sushi place in a strip mall.  But it's an acceptable, and more importantly, affordable sushi place in a world of expensive restaurants.  As far as Rock N' Roll, I'm not sure I get that vibe from this place.  Even in the middle of the day, it's dark but there's not especially rocking music.  I did notice a few large groups of day drinkers roam in as we sat there so I guess it must get wild with the drinking crowd at night.  The sushi was relatively rocking.  While they only have one vegetarian choice on the menu, off menu they are willing to make pretty much any kind of vegetable roll you can think of.  My avocado roll was not the best I ever had and I was a bit surprised by the small size of the roll but it definitely was high quality.  Combined with an order of fried rice, it hit the spot.  Honestly, the fried rice was better than the sushi and much cheaper.  While our server was rather aloof, she did bring us a spoon when we had trouble eating fried rice with chopsticks and she was rather jovial when we did see her.  And after another restaurant completely ignored us, it was at least good to get food.  Even if it was pretty average food in a city known for culinary excellence."}
{"text":"When you're in the Vegas, it's all about excess, whether it's gambling, drinking, clubbing, eating, or snorting coke. Uh. Yeah. I meant drinking Coke. Caffeine is essentially a major food group in the Vegas.  Anyway, if you enjoy other food groups and excessive eating, then Rock & Roll Sushi is as safe a bet as any in the Vegas. For $24.95 you get all you can eat made to order nigiri and rolls.   Here are the rules of the game: you have a one hour time limit, you order a round of sushi at a time, and you are charged if you leave anything on your plate.   I went two rounds. In round one, I had some miso soup, plenty of nigiri (salmon, yellow tail, albacore, tuna), a fried spicy tuna roll, and a rainbow roll with shrimp tempura inside. For round two, I enjoyed more salmon, yellow tail, and albacore.   The salmon was delightful. The albacore was tasty too. The yellow tail could have been better. I was not a fan of the tuna, but I have never been that into tuna for some reason, unless it is toro. My main grip with the nigiri was that in round one, the fish slices were very small. Look, I came here to eat and you're going to charge me if I leave food behind, so you might as well get my belly full early.  As for the rolls, they were good (especially the fried spicy tuna roll), but were sloppily made. For an all you can eat joint, they held back on the rice, which was nice.   The staff was cool. It was interesting to see a female sushi chef. I heard somewhere that you don't see many female sushi chefs because they have warmer hands than men, so it ruins the fish. I just think it's some urban legend that Japanese men spread around so Japanese women would have one less reason to wield a knife. I am not sure if my urban legend conspiracy theory is true, but I think other men in other cultures should try this too.   I am sure John Wayne Bobbitt would agree."}
{"text":"Rating based solely on service. In Vegas for a day and wanted take out sushi. Wow don't ask for take out here! The rude hostess told me it would be more than 20 min for the order. Mind you the place had NO WAIT. She tried to convince me to eat at the restaurant, so I told her there was no difference. If I stay wouldn't it also take 20 min for my food to arrive! Will update after I taste the food..."}
{"text":"A few friends and I came to this establishment for dinner one of the nights. We opted for the AYCE sushi special. Not really too much to say about this establishment. The all you can eat is about $27 before taxes and tip. The food is solid. The service is okay. I think there's some value in the AYCE.  To be honest, there isn't really anything great or horrible that stuck out to me about this establishment.  I would rate this establishment 3-4 stars. Nothing really special other than being AYCE and 24 hours. Would I come back? Yes. However, there are are a lot of other establishments I would prioritize before this."}
{"text":"We read the menu from outside $30/person all you can eat sushi. Then beverages $10/drink. Add tips that's a total of $100 easily for 2 persons.  For a place that's placed in a corner with screaming advertisement (AYCES), I can't justify $100.  So we didn't go in. I've had some bad experiences with below average & mediocre sushi restaurants which is why you should save your $100 and make a reservation at Nobu in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great prices for AYCE sushi. My favorite was the salmon and yellowtail. The salmon tasted so buttery and delicious! I liked the baked scallop roll too."}
{"text":"For Vegas (I repeat: for Vegas), this place is great value. $30 gets you all you can eat, made to order sushi from a chef who knows what he's doing.  Fish is solid quality all around, but I particularly like the salmon and albacore. Fried rolls also get the job done.  Don't be fooled by the crappy strip mall location - this place is legit.  Right across the street from encore/wynn."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on the weekend and they charged dinner price for lunch. On top of that they pre-added a 18% gratuity to our bill because our party was less than 4 people. (It was just the two of us). Disgustingly overprice for less than average sushi. This place is obviously a tourist trap; as a local I feel cheated. When we first walked it, it wreaked of beach. They are quick to greet/seat us. We did AYCE. When we placed our order, the waitress was overly concerned. They did not bring out everything we ordered at first. I understand that people waste, but we were extremely underestimated.  All the rolls were decent. There was nothing exceptional. What did leave an impression was the crunch roll. It was absolutely horrible. I am not a crunch roll connoisseur, but this was sincerely the worst roll I have ever had. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"The lady who seated us was very nice. My husband had the chicken teriyaki and loves it. I had the AYCE sushi. I order thee rolls and not one was good. Would never return to this place for sushi. The rolls he no flavor, even the ginger had no favor ."}
{"text":"Awesome, great service.  Soon as we stepped in we were greeted by the host and the chef.  $20 for all you can eat sushi, you get 3 rounds.  1st round, we ordered 12 rolls, we didn't have to wait long to get it... Hot and Crunchy Roll is a must.  There was 4 of us and we only paid about $90 but ate at least $200 worth, most definitely coming back to this spot on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Very poor service!! rude owner and waitresses!! Do not eat here!!  We went there at 9:30 when they close at 11, seemed  like they didn't want us to come. They didn't even welcomed us. As soon as we sat they told us they are closing soon so we have to order quickly. We ordered 10 orders of halibut but they only brought 5orders and made us order more again.  And sushi tasted not fresh.   Even though we didn't want to tip them but There was 18%mandatory gratuity. they knew no one will put any tip because of their poor service."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and decided to try it. When we walked up almost decided to find someplace else. An all you can eat sushi place scared us. We decided to try it and we were shocked at how good and high quality it is.  For $25 we got the best sushi  It was outstanding. If in town you must try this place."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is a must for the all you can eat! At first I was scared because I thought it was going to be like buffet style but it wasn't, it was made to order. I can't wait to come back to Vegas and make a stop here!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars to a place that serves all you can eat sushi, while you're buzzed, having a great time in VEGAS!  Was the food good? Sure! Everything tastes good and looks good after 8 beers!   But really, staff couldn't be nicer to us. I have no idea what we ate but we kept on eating and everything tasted so good and fresh.  The only thing i didn't like is that they add their tip on the bill."}
{"text":"food was ok...ive had better...i think the prices were a little on the high side for a place like this.  Something we really didnt like was the fact that no matter now many people you have in your party they automatically tip themselves 18%.  What really disturbed me was the fact that the waitress kept harassing us about how if the person getting the all you can eat share there food that we would all be charged for all you can eat prices. i explained to her at least 5 times that i DO NOT want the all you can eat and i wont eat that much.  I also ordered edamame and AGAIN she asked..\"who is eating it?\" obviously if i was ordering it i was eating it. and once again she said i will charge you all you can eat prices if you share your food! overall a HORRIBLE experience would NOT recommend this to ANYONE!"}
{"text":"Don't order a la carte, it's not worth the money, especially for the nigiris. All you can eat dinner is $25 plus gratuity and I didn't have to actually eat that much to get my moneys worth.  I did make sure to get my money's worth with 4 servings of seaweed salad in addition to soft-shell crab, and 6 nigiris. My co-workers got some rolls and they were also good. Fairly standard, but good. I recommend the Spicy Crunch Roll.  This fish is just fresh enough. It's not the freshest ever, but it's fresh enough. Looking at it, I wasn't concerned. However, on the nigiris, it seemed that the fish to rice ratio was way in favor of the rice which is why I don't recommend ordering nigiri al a carte, but I do recommend ordering a bunch in the all you can eat, and only eating half the rice on each one ;0 More fish for your money!   The Baked Green Mussels are also definitely worth getting. In fact that there is a limit of 3 orders of 3 per guest. Our table only had one order when we were close to finishing, I wished I filled up on them earlier.  Gratuity is included. Luckily the service was exceptional. I always had tea - my measure of service in any Asian restaurant. In fact it may be because of the service that I wouldn't object the next time my boss drags me here."}
{"text":"OMG! Yum yum yum I'm so darn full! This place makes rolls taste so darn good you wish your stomach was bigger.  At first we were thrown off cause when we looked it up it said all you can eat, but when you come in and see the menu, the prices are there. But the lady did reassure us that it is all you can eat. And we ate till our tummies were full. The staff were very nice and the place was clean.  Will I be coming back? Most def! I'm glad we came here. Gonna miss it when I leave."}
{"text":"Don't even waste your time .  Cons : over priced , small roll selection and all are similar, poor service , dark unappealing atmosphere , and they overcharge . Pros : fish was actually fresh .   When you get a bad vibe - listen to it !  The server / owner wasn't nice at all , we felt like a burden . When we went to pay we noticed they charged the tip already for a group of 3 . Which is fine but tell people so we don't tip twice because it's very easy to do that when you sign for your credit card receipt . WHO CHARGES TIP FOR A GROUP OF 3 ? It's the same amount I would have left but unheard of . Then one of the rolls they charged $1 extra that the menu stated price which I brought to their attention . It's set up this way in the system .... They do this to everyone i'm sure . The place is shady , over priced and definitely doesn't deserve to be in business ."}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat:  Lunch $21.95 Dinner $25.95  Ordered sweet shrimp, sea urchin, chicken terriyaki, baked mussel, calamari, soft shell crab, crunch & ninja roll. Crunch had shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, crab, crunch on top. Nothing amazing. Been to many other buffets with better quality. Service was fairly decent though"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place one star because it's unlimited but they give you a bad attitude when u start ordering more than two rolls  Unlimited means unlimited  Therefore if I want to eat 8 rolls I will eat eight rolls  Also when I asked for more lemons they told me they ran out  And it's okay I'm not going to so crazy if you run out, stuff happens, but they didn't run out because the people next to us asked for lemons and got lemons  (Damn right they heard me out, and I got my lemons) Anyways the food would have been a three and a half star but the attitude of the people running the place makes it unpleasant."}
{"text":"Best service & food, everyone was very nice and attentive. The family business is great, they make everyone feel at home. Very helpful with me when my phone didn't charge."}
{"text":"Great food and service! We were supposed to go to Chipotle but he missed the turn and we ended up here instead. We had the option of ordering al le cart style or all you can eat. It was pretty cool too cause the lady mentioned that we can order it ale cart style but if we wanted to, we can change it to all you can eat after. Obviously, we ended up ordering more than the price for the lunch buffet.   I absolutely loveddd the dynamite and seaweed salad. I also liked how the dynamite wasn't on top of California rolls like how other places do. However, we did  notice how they would add the brown, I think teriyaki sauce, on all the rolls though. Other than that, i'm so glad we ran into this place!"}
{"text":"Shockingly good for the location. Don't let the all you can eat scare you, it was made in front of me and very fresh. Service was fine. I'd go back."}
{"text":"My favorite was \"Hot crunch roll\" and on nigiri small amount of rice with thick cut fish too...i could just tell the chef. Nam was genuinely nice guy who actually has a common sense :) i had experienced a super friendly service!!! Price is reasonable considering it's located on the strip (the rent gotta be way higher than local sushi restaurants that do AYCE...) I'll b defiantly coming back soon again."}
{"text":"Very good food. Come hungry awesome sushi!! Off the strip but worth the trip. All you can eat, good service. When I first saw this I wanted to leave but trust me stay and eat!!"}
{"text":"BAKED SALMON ROLL.   Delicious. Seriously. I've never had one like the one they serve here. I'm about to go back and get a second one I can't stop thinking about it.   Also the wonderful ladies who run this restaurant are always polite and kind! I eat here a couple times a week and I've never had a negative experience!! Thank you rock n roll sushi for being AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"21$ for lunch AYCE. This is when we went. Walked in, not crowded at all. Actually a little empty, just parties of 2.  I was expecting a laminated menu where you order quantities. This one has the \"rounds.\" 3 rounds, check the things you like.   On the menu, I loved that there was tons of things to be ordered. Nigiri was available (better be for 21$ lunch) thankfully (i like nigiri you could guess) in addition to things like appetizers and hand rolls.   this chef had some fresh fish. melt in your mouth flavor. the albacore was so amazing i took small bites to make it last (yes that's what i did am i a fool or what)   the rolls were on the warmer side (but not too warm) which i liked and the rice, fish, everything was tasty and of great quality. better than the norcal ayce places 10000%. welcome to vegas!!!!! i know and heard there are places with a lot more fresh than this but im excited that this was a good impression for me for \"vegas sushi\"  service was friendly too, not the best however. but OK for the place you know.  ninja roll, blackjack roll, baked salmon roll - all amazing small rolls (not oversized!)"}
{"text":"Good sushi! Good service! Make substitutions on request for no additional charge! Great!"}
{"text":"The quality of the sushi here is not that great.  The fish itself was mediocre at best, not very fresh and kind of rubbery.  The rice was worse.  It was undercooked and had a weird after-taste.  Every nigiri felt like a mouthful of tiny pebbles.   I also don't believe the prices are that great.  We ordered a la carte, and a plate of nigiri salmon was $4-$5, but the quality did not match up to the price.  I've had way better nigiri for cheaper.  All of this was tolerable, but a couple things annoyed me.  First, they charge you dinner price for AYCE lunches on the weekends.  That was disappointing, since there was kind of no way of knowing this before walking into the restaurant.  The second thing was they stated that there was a mandatory gratuity on parties of any size, but they never told us that it would be on non-AYCE orders as well.  I understand if we were 2 people eating 20 plates each for AYCE, yes that would be a lot of work for the server.  But we were two people, ordering 4 items a la carte.  How is this different from any other restaurant that doesn't charge an automatic gratuity?  And no, the service was not exponentially better than other restaurants, especially considering there were only 4 other patrons in here.  To add insult to injury, they charged the 15% mandatory gratuity ON TOP of the tax.  It's not the money that bothers me, it's the principle.  If you are going to charge a mandatory gratuity on us, it should be on the price of the food only.  I normally calculate the tip on top of the tax anyway.  But when they make it mandatory, I feel like I'm not even given a choice, and that I am forced to pay a gratuity that is not based on performance of the service.  It also gives the sense that this business is shady and trying to pull a fast one.  Banquets and wedding receptions understand this concept; they calculate tax and tip separately, each on the same value: the price of the food (or per head).  If this restaurant really wants more money, they should just raise the prices on the menu.  The bottom line is, the only time this place MIGHT be worth going to is for AYCE weekday lunches."}
{"text":"Wow, once again learning the lesson to always check Yelp before  you go anywhere. Others have put it better than I could have. There are plenty of other places to spend your money - spend it with someone who appreciates your business and gives good value for the money.  And who in the hell nails on an automatic 15-18% tip?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"Stopped in here between flights on my last leg home from Spain and really enjoyed the little place. Nice decor, sushi wasn't bad, but the customer service was outstanding! $24.95 for all you can eat sushi, (or by the roll which is what I got) for anything on the menu. Down side no sashimi, but the baked lobster roll was awsome! Skip the miso though, the seaweed is a little too chewy!"}
{"text":"This is the very sucks place i ever seen. The manager is a bitch. She charged every fucking things that you tried to order like hot tea or lemon? what the fuck?! Don't waste your money on this restaurant I seriously said this. The manageris being so stupid as fuck! Charging 15 % for service ? Is it make sense?"}
{"text":"For an all you can eat sushi joint on the strip, this place is alright.  There are better places, but not walking distance from hotels at the convention center.  Prices are great, service is spotty.  But all in all a perfectly acceptable exoerience."}
{"text":"Disappointing! The only reason I came here b/c I was too hung-over to drive to Yama.   $25 for dinner, hot tea $2.95. Gratuity is mandatory and included in your bill. wtf? Food is mediocre at best, fish is not very fresh. I ordered two half rolls, but was informed by the waitress that the sushi chef is \"busy\" and can only make whole rolls. Um, there was only 3 people in the restaurant including me. wtf?   Besides the location (short stumble to the Wynn/Encore) and easy parking, there's NOTHING good about this place."}
{"text":"I loved it,  the sushi was fresh and brought out timely. The total bill was less then 33 dollars a person including tip.  The all you can eat is a great deal in Vegas on the strip.    We ate all the rolls and did not have a problem with re-ordering on a forth round.    The place was clean and they have a \"A\" rating.   Staff was good to us, little bit of language challenge but that made it fun."}
{"text":"Great Sushi!!!! Great Chef!!!!! Horrible service!!!!   Born and raised in these united states, I completely understand English and after 16 year of schooling I can definitely read a menu, for some reason I was treated by a server/ manager as if I couldn't comprehend... Lol  After leaving the nail salon in the area we decided to walk over to this place for a bit to eat. They have a special for \"all you can eat sushi\" for 25.00, so it was automatically assumed that we wanted the special..... So details about the \"all you can eat sushi\" were discussed right away, and that we had to eat everything on our plate before we could order more, and we needed to understand that an 18 percent gratuity is expected....and so on and so forth. I finally interrupted her and explained that we were not interested in her \"all you can eat sushi\" special, it was 1pm and we were just grabbing a couple of rolls (lady, please calm down).   We sat at the sushi bar and the chef gave a little giggle as we made comments about the manager/waitress being a lunatic. I ordered the dragon roll, it was sooooo yummy. My friend ordered the crunch roll and we kinda shared both of the rolls. My tab was about $14 which was not bad. We tipped the Chef and got out of there before she added a price to the water, pickled ginger and wasabi. Lol   3 stars for the Chef and the food only. My next visit to Vegas I will be sure to search for a place with better service."}
{"text":"Rock n Roll Sushi is a restaurant to be avoided.  They fail to surpass being \"average\" in any single category relevant to an individual's enjoyable dining experience.  The food and service at the restaurant is subpar.  Some of their portions are exceedingly small, which makes their nominally low menu prices relatively expensive.  I have definitely had better sushi at a cheaper price.  While the restaurant's decor and interior design may be described as surprisingly chic, it is only so because its exterior looks like that of an industrial factory.    The octopus roll I ordered was not fresh.  The tempura seemed like it consisted only of baked vegetables and fried dough w/ no seasoning whatsoever.  The vegetable fried rice, however, was prepared with plenty of wok heat, which contributes to its savory flavor and firm texture.  The food came all out of order; the main entrees arrived first and the appetizers arrived last.  The waitress seemed a little impatient with us, and we were automatically charged gratuity even though we were only a party of three.  My friend said, \"This definitely isn't the best sushi I had.\"  I whole-heartedly agree, and would go so far as to say it's probably one of the worst."}
{"text":"I love this place . First thing when i go to Vegas , I start off with an all you can eat sushi . YES I LOVE SUSHI and there's nothing more satisfying than an all you can eat. Rock and Roll sushi is located down the strip , not too far from the Hotel Encore. The staff was very friendly and welcoming , they even suggested  to eat sushi with their famous sake bomb.  For people who are trying desperately to find sushi not far from the Stirp , look no further , this place will make you fly to Heaven ."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is getting a star is because of the food. It was \"okay\".   Basically, a shitload of California rolls topped with different types of fish. Cool. Not worth $27 a person for all you can eat.  The service SUCKED. The lady was rude, gave us ONE menu to split between four of us and took it away before we had even ordered. Whatever.  The kicker? They charged us an 18% gratuity per check because we had 5 people sitting at our table but only four of us were eating. For what? She came by our table three times in the entire time we were there to drop off plates.  What's even more bullshit? The rolls we ordered amounted to maybe half of the total they charged us altogether. And she had the nerve to ask is if we're leaving a tip in cash or on the card? Yeah not likely.   Also, $3 for a can of soda?   Never, ever coming back, and neither is anyone else I know."}
{"text":"I was very surprised with how nice the interior of this place was, considering it was located in a seedy strip mall.  My friends and I were looking for some sushi and originally had decided on Sushi Mon, until we realized it was 6 miles away from our hotel. (The Hilton Grand Vacations Club on the strip.)  Anyway, I remember walking past this place and thought, \"I'll probably end up here after I get drunk\", but sure enough, ended up coming sober. (Which made me a little nervous.)  Either way, I was initially very shocked with the appearance of the inside, and impressed, considering.  I wasn't greeted by the usual blast of AC in most every Las Vegas building, but luckily it wasn't too sweltering hot outside so it was fine.  The sushi was pretty good for the price (about $22 for all-you-can-eat), but we noticed they added more and more rice to the subsequent rolls you ordered. I, however, kept a napkin on my lap, and kept removing the rice and placing it in my lap when our server and the sushi chef weren't looking.  Overall, we got our money's worth. Not the best sushi in the world, but worth it for the price. But the fact that they automatically add gratuity kinda sucks, but it is what it is."}
{"text":"They need to change there bullshit tip included system. Also need to swap the bitchy waitress.  Fish is good though."}
{"text":"Well...I think I could have done better with my $25 for AYCE sushi. I also probably should have known better when there were only two other patrons.   Most of the rolls are totally laden with mayo, making it hard to get down. The spicy tuna on the outside of the Spicy Crunch roll tasted funky and had an awkward texture that was anything but fish-like. The albacore is excellent though, so we loaded up on that before we rolled out the door all fat and sassy like.   I'd probably hit up Todai..."}
{"text":"Food was pretty tasty and the waitress was very nice and friendly... Overall, if I'm really hungry and in the mood for sushi, would probably come back..."}
{"text":"We wanted sushi so... we came here! The sushi was just okay... nothing spectacular and the fish was not that fresh. The waitress was nice and welcoming. I like that they have large tables for big groups. Obviously, this place isn't well known about since there were only two tables during lunch including us. I like that we got free icecream in the end! Yay green tea icecream!!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing! Very kind waitresses and sushi chef. Me and my boyfriend had an unexpected trip to Vegas for a family emergency and came across rock n roll sushi. We are sushi lovers and it hit the spot! Sushi was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great presentation of sushi with active waiter. You can eat how much you want. But still sooo much expensive.. I can recommend japan beer, which makes space in your stomach for big challenge (all you can eat sushi)."}
{"text":"I wish I could put half of a star . Excuse my language but the waitress is a complete and total bitch. Assuming that I've never eaten sushi in my entire life, (been eating it since I was 5) . They put way too much rice for their sushi. Was placing it on the side to eat later and she said \"please stop it no more leftover rice\" ( when I was eating it separately) excuse me?! I'm paying $25 I shld be able to eat how I please.AYCE states you can eat as much as you want with anything unfortunately here they don't do that which is stupid. The staff is staring at us excessively and when I pointed out they were being rude they started treating me even worse. They automatically  include tip in the bill so even if you didn't want to tip you have to -__-The sushi is good too much rice I will not come here again"}
{"text":"My wife and I live in Vegas and its a local favorite. Great quality sushi and its very fresh and expertly prepared, and its all YOU CAN EAT!"}
{"text":"We only came here because we were unfortunately too hungry to wait at Tacos El Gordo. The food was just ok and the service wasn't great either. First of all, the lady who greeted us only offered the AYCE menu ($25/person), which is not really AYCE as you are limited to only 3 rounds of food and given a set of \"rules\" to follow; it wasn't until we asked that we got the regular menu. After refusing the AYCE option, the waitress became a bit more rude...  A bunch of us ordered sushi rolls, and there was nothing to really rave over. I got the American Roll and was surprised to find that the salmon was pretty fresh, but the sushi rice was dry/undercooked. I wouldn't come back here. I'd recommend finding quality food and service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Bro.. They tried to change me TWICE. For less than half a roll I couldn't finish.. What in the world.. I already paid 35 bucks.. And they said you need to finish your food or you get charged twice. Thought she was joking.. But she started a whole arguments in front of the whole store because I didn't want to pay TWICE for food I ALREADY PAID FOR. I cannot believe the police haven't shut this scam down. She purposely collected our our first payment as our first roll came out because she knew this whole thing is a sushi scam. Wooooow never eating sushi again. Oh and they charge you a mandatory 15% gratuity"}
{"text":"Come here with so much hungry great and comfortable place to me. Sushi Is Delicious. High recommend"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and wonderfully warm people. Me and my husband came in with our 2year old and the women in the front were amazing! We got a baked salmon, ninja roll, dragon roll and Vegas roll all were delicious i was surprised there's usually one I'm not sure about, but not this time I loved each roll. We came from Oceanside for the weekend and we'll definitely be back here when ever we come back to Vegas  best sushi I've ever had. The consistency in the sizes, textures, and flavors was outstanding and OMG the serving sizes are way more than enough. I love sushi and usually I can finish 3 orders by myself easy, that wasn't the case this time. My husband was full after one serving and I got stuck eating everything my self lol. Definitely no need for the all you can eat title you'll be full from your first order."}
{"text":"This place is the worst!!! A bunch of scam artists!! False advertising rude bastards!! This place is. It all you can eat it is all they feel like giving you before they give you the check and ask you to leave.  I was there for 30 minutes and had 2 rolls when I was brought my check and told I was done because I \"broke the rules\" by not eating all of he rice in every roll.  Please do yourself a favor and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Disappointed is first word that comes to mind on my recent visit here. The moment you walk in, the cashier instantly tries to push you into purchasing the All You Can Eat special, which at that time, my crew and I werent THAT hungry.   With that said, the American Roll and Dynamite scallop is what I ordered. The roll was good, but I was very disatisfied by the scallops. It was severely watered down and submerged in \"juice.\"   Now the worse part, the bill came and I was shocked I was instantly charged 15% tip. The service and experience doesnt warrant a 15% tip. The staff here needs to rethink their policies."}
{"text":"The sushi here is really good. Very fresh!! $25.95 for dinner AYCE sushi. You get 3 rounds of ordering, but only 45 minutes of eating.  Only thing that knocked off 2 stars is they lurk over you as you're eating and constantly walk up to you to see how much you've finished. I guess that's because they don't want to make more unless they're sure you can finish what you have on your table, but they also charge you for food you ordered, but don't finish, and that includes food they have not made yet. Why would they charge you for something that wasn't even made? They also add an 18% gratuity on parties 4 or less, something they could've told us after I told the waitress it was our first time there. I don't remember the gratuity on parties more than 4."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean but there was definitely a weird smell.  Also its Vegas, and really hot, so you go indoors to cool off...not here.  It was su uncomfortably hot that it was not a pleasant experience.  The food is average at best.  I got the all you can eat, so value was good.  The service was deplorable!  I hadn't even finished putting a piece a roll in my mouth when the server took my plate...I wasn't finished.  RUDE!  I guess another pet peeve I have is the tip.  When they automatically add it, it ticks me off.  I always leave a good tip, she would have gotten more had they let me make the decision.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my life, let alone sushi. I was extremely disappointed and will never be returning.  Let me start by saying that Rock N Roll Sushi has been on my list of go to sushi restaurants for a while now and I finally visited. What attracted me were decent reviews, alcoholic beverages, and a professional website. Yesterday at roughly 4pm I called and asked if there was currently a wait and if the AYCE included EVERYTHING on the menu. I was told by a female that there was no wait and EVERYTHING on the menu was included in AYCE.  We arrived at about 5pm and the place was completely empty (told the truth about no wait). We are asked how many and we state 4. Immediately told there will be a 15% gratuity included on bills of 4 or less because they're \"on the strip\". Hardly on the strip and have ate at finer restaurants in casinos with no such BS rule, but I'm hungry so it's a go.  Once seated we're asked if we're doing AYCE or A La Carte. I state the 3 adults will do AYCE and my 4 year old daughter will do A La Carte. I was told the whole table needs to do AYCE or A La Carte, no exceptions. So I need to pay $28 for a 4 year old to eat some chicken and rice? I dispute it with the server because she's 4 years old and she gives me an attitude and says \"whatever\". While the server is getting our drinks I'm looking at the AYCE rules and it clearly states SASHIMI IS NOT INCLUDED. Upon her return I asked her if that was true and she said yes. I asked her why not even an hour ago she LIED to me on the phone and said EVERYTHING was included. She denied ever having the conversation with me and played dumb.  She was extremely disrespectful and didn't care if we left or not. We left without saying another word. I will never return and I hope others don't waste their time.  We ended up going to Doh Sushi on Spring Mountain. Go there! Absolutely delicious, great service, same price, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Rock n' Roll Sushi was ok. It was close to our hotel on the strip, so a group of us ventured over for dinner one night.   All you can eat (AYCE) sushi for $25 a person is definitely a good deal. You can order up to 3 rounds, but must eat all pieces or they'll charge you for whatever is left over. They have a ton of options on the AYCE menu, from sushi to rolls to dessert. The sushi and rolls were ok, not bad, but definitely not the best I've even had. What do you expect for $25?   As we ordered a variety of rolls, I found that all of them had fake crab salad inside. They must use it as a filler. The fried rolls are interesting, such as the sexy girl. Worth trying one! Also, we were not a fan of the baked rolls...warm sushi rolls = weird."}
{"text":"Wow. This place sucks. Service super rude. Food terrible (I forced down two rolls, my wife had tempura, disgusting, thick batter, more like bad fish & chips). Expensive drinks ($9 for a sapporo). Added a tip to the bill \"because that's their policy\". Just don't go to this rathole."}
{"text":"Worst sushi experience in 20 years, some have bad sushi but good service or vice verse but this place has neither for the true sushi diner. Just left because I orderd all you can eat and orderd four items, they were all typical thin slices of sushi but one was not good and they waitress yelled at me. Yes yelled at me, said it's the rules that if I don't finish it she will charge me and I can't order anything else.   Refused to tip. Paid my bill and said goodbye. Too many options to be mistreated by a restaurant owner.   The nigiri was not bad but not great, heading to another sushi restaurant now to get my fix $40 wasted on one all you can eat dinner!"}
{"text":"How do I start this review?  Simply put, outright disgusting service. The atmosphere was downright toxic and disappointing. When we called in advance to reserve our table. The waitress was incredibly kind to us. However upon arrival we were met with sheer lack of quality on the managements part. There was a obvious loss in translation in our situation. We had with us a diabetic friend who regulates his diet very carefully. Especially in regards to rice, originally we asked the waitress if we could order nigiri. She originally said yes that is fine. However we also brought up the discussion of our friend and his issues. At 1st she was ok with the idea of him eating some sushi. But every so often discard rice and just give the leftover rice to one of us to eat. By technicality he was eating all the food he ordered. But when the manager got wind of this. The management outright changed the entire mood and killed our will to eat there. Instead of coming up with a compromise for our friend. We were told by the waitress as a order from the management that our friend must order sashimi. They refused to accept our order continuously when we tried to politely explain the issue. We instead decided to just pay for our drinks and leave.  Normally I am a very reserved person in writing reviews. But its what the manager did that struck a major chord with me. During our final moments of sipping our drinks. The manager was hiding behind the sushi bar where the chef worked. Every so often I personally looked over at her. She had the most intense glare and it was at our disabled friend.  The pure and utter lack of respect for their customers amazes me. I'm shocked a place like this has remained in operation as long as it has. This is a PSA advisory to anyone wanting all you can eat sushi.  Do not visit this restaurant. Their ordering process is obscenely complicated to grasp. You are met with utter scrutiny and lack of respect. This is not worth any of their so called \"delicious sushi\". Me and my friends will not be visiting this area again."}
{"text":"Seen all the bad reviews. So i was worried. But i was already in the same area and hungry. And It wasnt bad at all! Wasnt packed out but it was busy, and they were fast to get my rolls out. Good place to get your fix."}
{"text":"Service is poor, sashimi is not included in all you can eat and they charge for left overs. And all you can eat has a 1 hour limit and you can only get 1 scoop of \"ice cream\". Food was average."}
{"text":"We stumbled on Rock and Roll Sushi. So, we thought we would take a shot.  Boy, are we glad we did! As visitors to Las Vegas it is very easy to overspend for a meal, or get inadequate food, but NOT here.   The All-You-Can-Eat lunch was just $21.95! The Sushi Chef, Kiyo, is masterful! Everything was delicious and visually stunning. Kiyo was skilled and friendly in making sure we got a variety of sushi. The fish is flawlessly fresh and flavorful.   Dinner is just $5.oo more. Don't miss it!  Get out of your hotel and enjoy this local restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great rolls, I'm no sushi expert but I loved this place. Staff was super nice, food was awesome and price was reasonable. You would pay 3xs as much for decent sushi in the hotels. Parking was easy on a Sat afternoon too."}
{"text":"Added a 15% gratuity for bad service for 2 people. Each order put in takes 20 min. Food was decent but takes way too long!"}
