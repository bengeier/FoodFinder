{"text":"Had breakfast at Fulton's this morning with a party of 6. Whoever wrote that bad review on this place must have been drunk, hung over, or po'd at the world! This place was outstanding in every way; food, proportions, service, whatever you want. Price in line with Vegas. If you like breakfast, don't miss this one!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, Noodle bar is good I had Shrimp Fried Rice, Pizza by slice expensive, salad bar, like Cafeteria and if you sit at tables away from noodle bar which seem like all others it's to go. Not really comfy."}
{"text":"Combination fried rice was legit. Pretty close to authentic except they had some lettuce as a filler. Had the Tokyo ramen. It was ok, I've had better but it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"I came here to try the ramen. The service was fast but the ramen was just average. The egg in the ramen was cold...it probably came straight from the refrigerator. I got the Tokyo ramen which was $13. The portion size was large enough to fill you up. Overall, it was pretty good for $13 on the strip."}
{"text":"Awesome little cafe-y type place. We got rolls here one day and they were great. The next time we were there I got frozen yogurt, which was really good, and my husband for cheesecake, which was amazing. Nice, quiet-ish spot, relaxing and calm for the middle of a casino."}
{"text":"Wow! I'd probably give 5 stars if this outlet was just slightly closer to a restroom to wash up before meals. All in all, my experience here was stellar. I was blown away by the fresh ingredients, the quality of the food, good portions, and LOTS of health conscious options. Every single one of the staff were courteous, kind, and helpful from the meal prep, to the cash register, to the bussing staff who seemed very pleased to see me bussing my own table...I mean, doesn't everyone? Either way, even he was very friendly and service oriented. The Victorian/Edwardian themed style reminiscent of old Market Deli's was a nice plus too. It's always good to see when Vegas remembers that extra spending on theming does not mean it is always appropriate to make everything look like a tawdry night-club or the set of a Hollywood game show. I will also say that having previously only really experienced the smaller Harrahs in Tahoe which was not up to my standards, this experience has me seriously reconsidering this venue."}
{"text":"We tried wonton noodle soup and Sichuan beef noodles soup. The material has good quality and the taste is nice too."}
{"text":"Fulton Street is convenient and easy to access. Great selection of desserts, food, coffee and yogurt. Open 24 hours, it's a great midnight snack. Also one of the only places in Vegas you get a fountaint drink you fill yourself...and can refill! Ya, that never happens in hotels! The desserts are amazing. Sandwiches are frest and tasty. Noodle place is also good. Next, need to try the pizza. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I just pass by and do not have big expectation on food, while the food quality is quite good for Tokyo Ramen and fried BBQ pork rice, comparing with Venetian, nice noodle bar and reasonable price"}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised! Beautiful atmosphere and pretty good food. Caesars really sunk some money in this space and it shows! You'll forget you're in Harrahs. I had the classic French toast with coffee. Both were head and shoulders better than the buffet versions next door. You might be tempted to go to the buffet since the price is about the same, but your one plate from Fulton Street will taste waaaaaay better than the five you'll eat at the buffet. And, your waist will thank you."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here.  The spicy tuna looked like ground beef, and was a slushy ground pink looking. I was afraid of eating it.  The won ton soup was not good. It was under cooked ramen noodles with mystery ground filling.   Don't waste your money here.  It's not worth the $$. when I asked for a cup they charged me $1. I  had bought the soda in a bottle there."}
{"text":"If you're craving Asian food, go to the noodle bar at Fultons!! My friends and I got some quick grub here in the middle of the afternoon and it was pretty darn good! It wasn't busy at all at the noodle bar. Only one other table. Noodle bar is also a sit down area where a waitress serves you. I didn't go anywhere else in Fultons, but the other places looked like you approach the counter and order there. I had the beef noodle soup and thought it was absolutely delicious!!! Nice tender beef with baby bok choy and yummy noodles! My other friend got the dan dan noodles which they made extra spicy for her. She said she loved it. I wouldn't get the HK pan fried noodles though. They were pretty bland. The lady that serves us though was super sweet too. Prices were fair. It's Vegas after all and it is located in Harrah's which is along the strip."}
{"text":"Make a beeline for the noodle bar. Ramen, udon , Dan-Dan all are first class. Stocks show slow simmering, the crispy duck roasted daily and fast and efficient service.   The bowls are at the goldilocks point: not too large, not too small   The sushi from the counter adjacent was also fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Breakfast smoothies are made from frozen packages. Limited fresh fruit available to add. Cheesecake is awful. Several breakfast items pre-made. Wouldn't recommend if another option was easily accessible."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Maria is the best server we've had in a long time. My 4yo daughter and her hit it off great. Chicken fried steak is a good way to start your day, and this is a good one. Will return before we go home."}
{"text":"This place totally surprised me. I was expecting cafeteria food and actually received a great breakfast. I ordered the Fulton Street Breakfast Skillet. It consisted of two scrambled eggs, roasted red potatoes, onions, bell peppers, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, pork sausage and toast. The skillet breakfast was bursting with flavor.   I also ordered hot chocolate topped with whip cream. It was delicious as well."}
{"text":"So many variety from breakfast to dessert. Their pizza and salad are amazing. Want more they have sushi and burritos. Their desserts are amazing from the cupcakes to their crepes. This place hit the mark."}
{"text":"I tried this place for breakfast in my hotel after trying two other places that had hour long waits.  The location is right across from the casino area. I am not going to lie, I was pretty hungover when we finally decided on this place so I did not really look at the menu like I usually do. I ended up with a breakfast skillet which included potatoes, grilled veggies, an egg and loads of CRISPY BACON!! The portion was a great size and it did the job for me in the morning. THE BACON WAS SOOO CRISPY AND THERE WAS SO MUCH OF IT IN MY SKILLET! The service was just terrible. We sat for a while and watched our server worry about other tables and checking for tips instead of at least greeting us. She just had a nasty attitude. My friend ordered biscuits with gravy and the biscuits were atrocious. They tasted like they were pulled out of a store bag and thrown onto the plate and then smothered in sad, tasteless gravy. Everything was reasonably priced and if I stayed in Harrah's again, I would not be afraid to go back down for breakfast, or order it for room service."}
{"text":"We walked through the Harrah's casino to catch some AC (lol) and we passed by this place. Generally, \"cafes\" in casinos are never too good but my bf wanted some sushi that they sold there. You can either be seated and served on the left side of the place or walk up to any of the 3 registers they had and just order to go. They had 3 diff sections, one sold Asian food (sushi, fried rice, chow mein, ramen etc), another sold stuff like (chips, coffee, tea, hot dogs, muffins, macarons etc) and the last register had stuff like pizza. It looked like a little cafeteria.  We ordered the salmon sushi, miso ramen and pork fried rice.  To my surprise, everything was delicious! The salmon sushi just had salmon and cream cheese, but they were big slices of salmon and it didn't have to much rice. The miso ramen was good for a café, although I expected different kind of noodles, and the egg to be more yolky (if you know what I mean) in the middle. And the fried rice had a lot of meat, pretty big portion and it wasn't oily!    Great experience!"}
{"text":"Walked past this area quite a few times exiting the Monorail & thought it looked cute with it's décor especially for a food court. This trip the hubs came down with the flu & I needed to get him some soup. He went for a soup & sandwich combo. The portion was big enough to share so we did. The clam chowder was pretty good. I don't think it was house made but it hit the spot for the hubs & the sandwich was on a soft ciabatta roll, chalk full of fresh veg, the roast beef was perfectly rare & the horseradish sauce was on point with it's creamy texture & slight kick. A little more kick would've been good for me but I realize not everyone likes their horseradish to punch them in the face like me. I saw a few fams eating the ramen from the Asian Café & I love me some ramen so I'll be back to try that next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast a few times. Its pretty sweet that you get to gamble while your food comes.  The last time i ordered the breakfast burrito, it was delicious...complimentary coffee since i was gambling...prices are good too (:"}
{"text":"I can't speak for all the different eateries but will review the Asian noodle bar.  I have eaten there for several years.  Reasonably priced.  Well cooked and prepared noodles.  The beef chow fun, won ton and Singapore curry noodles are outstanding.  The service is attentive.  I have also had a few of the sushi rolls as well.  Decent rolls.  Fish used was fresh and formed well.  I had the spicy tuna and fire roll."}
{"text":"Great selection of a variety of foods: sushi, pizza, sandwiches, soup, noodles, burgers, pastries, tacos, etc all in one space in Harrah's Hotel & open late. Clean area, convenient & affordable for Vegas. Had a late night snack: bagel overflowing with lox, tomatoes, dill cheese, & red onion. Could only eat half. The salad bar looked awesome (you choose the toppings & they make it for you). While most hotels have a eatery that stays open late or even 24 hrs, this is Harrah's version & I like the variety as a guest. Probably wouldn't make it a food destination if I wasn't staying here."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here this morning and will not go back!   We were seated fairly quickly,  but then it took forever for our waitress to come take our order.   I ordered the 2 egg breakfast and my husband ordered a breakfast burrito.   The couple next to us had to call the waitress over just to place their order.  They didn't seem that busy and it still took at least 20 minutes for our food to come out.   The eggs were watery,  my toast was cold, and their hash browns weren't hash browns,  but deep fried potato rounds.   My husband said the breakfast burrito was the worst he's over had.   $40 for nasty breakfast food just isn't worth it to me!"}
{"text":"Truly an amazing alternative to the buffet that used to take up this space. Not that I have anything against a buffet, but it's nice to have a choice and a setting that was reminiscent of Ponce City Market in Atlanta or Chelsea Market in New York City.  Things take a turn for the worse when you venture into the exotic world of Tex/Mex food like tacos and quesadillas. My beef quesadilla was basically a few scoops of stew meat on a flour tortilla with melted cheddar cheese. Imagine a slimy soft taco your mother made you when you were a kid and you've got the exact description. I ended up adding lettuce, pico, and sour cream and then eating the meat out of the middle.  The deli sandwiches that my aunt and uncle got looked a lot better (and apparently had an authentic vibe that was lacking from my quesadilla)."}
{"text":"Good variety of food; noodles, sushi, pizza, burgers, tacos, and salads. There is also some desserts that will hit the spot. Prices are high ($7-12 average per) but understandable  (Tourist =$).  BIZZBURGER: very interesting item that I had to try. It's a cheese burger with carmelized onions between pepperoni pizza. Crazy huh? But it actually was good. So the pizza (top and bottom) is round about 6in in diameter, giving the effect of a burger with the pepperoni and cheese inside facing the burger. I could taste the pizza with a the flavor of a burger with every bite. No ketchup or mustard was needed. The pizza sauce was enough to make it very flavorful. The only negative was that the pepperoni made it very oily. Maybe if it was a veggie or sausage pizza, it would've been less oily.   Cost: $12.  With fries and drink $19  Would I try it again? Definitely. You should too"}
{"text":"This review is for the waiter service breakfast served until 11:30.  Not bad! We wanted breakfast without having to the leave the convenience of air conditioning so we settled for the food hall.  I wasn't expecting much because it is an older casino but we were actually pleasantly surprised.    -country fried steak: steak and gravy were ok, eggs cooked just the way I liked but what really made me happy was their hash browns:  like someone took a pan and smashed a crispy tater tot and made it even more crispy.  If there's one breakfast item that I can't say no to its crispy tater tots. - applewood bacon  dipped in pancake batter so the bacon is embedded in the pancake mix.  Yum! And these aren't your flimsy pieces of bacon, there are thick cut pieces. What I didn't care too much for was the bourbon syrup that tasted a little too much bourbon and not enough maple.  Getting our food took about 30 minutes.    Experience was not too shabby."}
{"text":"Late arrival from Phoenix left us little to choose from for a quick bite so we decided to give the pizza a try.   Let's just say I don't believe it will be an option for me.   The people behind the counter were less then enthusiastic to be helping us and the pizza itself tasted like cardboard."}
{"text":"Huge breakfast and brunch plates!  We tried pancakes, egg Benedicte's and muffins  Its very affordable and reasonable pricing good for big groups"}
{"text":"I have to write this review right now as I'm trying to eat these tacos. (Taco review only.) dry chicken. Weird textured chicken. Cilantro, onion and salsa is great. Chicken is weird. Two tacos for $7 not too bad for the strip. #mysterychicken"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick bite. It's overpriced for sure, but then again it's on the Vegas strip, everything is overpriced. There's great variety to choose from here and tons of seating. We ate at the sushi place and while the sushi was ok, the noodles are awesome. Quite authentic considering it's located in a food court."}
{"text":"We ALWAYS eat at the Asian noodle restaurant in the Fulton Street Food Hall while in Vegas.  It used to be Ming's Table before; a Chinese restaurant.  The staff is prompt, friendly (he even offered to allow me to charge my phone up at the counter while we had lunch) and efficient.  Cashew chicken and a sushi roll is our usual choice, but we've had the wonton soup, chow fun, fried rice and a few other dishes before too.  Everything is up to par; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our international singing group spent the weekend at Harrah's in Las Vegas and chose to eat breakfast here last Saturday and Sunday Oct 15-16, 2016. Saturday's experience was great. The breakfast food was very good. I had a side order of bacon and the biscuits in country gravy. The servers were friendly, attentive, and we therefore planned to return the next day. Sunday was a totally different experience here. The manager's name was Esther. She and the waiter were very rude and unaccommodating in seating our group together. There was even a group of tables placed together from a previous large group which they broke down into small tables rather than seating us there. If we had the time to have gone to a different restaurant, we would have left. In response, we moved some tables and chairs ourselves to accommodate our group. Fortunately there was a very nice and competent waiter named Alberto who saved the day and was tipped accordingly. When he saw some of our group's food just left on a nearby serving tray without a word, he served us and took the rest of our group's orders. He was always there with coffee and made sure our group was well taken care of."}
{"text":"Stayed in Harrah's for a week with the family and time and again, one of us would get hungry.  Fulton Street was logically the first and best destination for a fill up.  My granddaughter got a box of cereal and milk one day.  I got tacos on two occasions.  My mother-in-law got a hotdog when she felt hungry one night.  Convenient, but since it's in Las Vegas and inside a world-class casino/hotel, you've got to be willing to pay the price."}
{"text":"There definitely were no bargains to be had here.   But that's par the course for Vegas.     What it lacked in bargains it made up in convenience since it was right downstairs from our hotel room.  The food we had was decent but overpriced.   $13 for my reuben for example.   A main negative is there wasn't any clear directions on the procedure regarding getting food.   The closest comparison we had was Chicago's Water Tower Place food court which actually gives each person a card and the food stations subsequently add your bill to the card and you pay after you eat.   In this case they give you receipts and you take it up to the cashier before you eat.   That caused some pretty heavy backups in the cashier lane, of which there was only one person working.    Water Tower Place has the backups too but at least you have a full belly while waiting to pay.   LOL."}
{"text":"Just paid 33 for two slices of pizza and two beers, way over priced and not worth it. What a ripoff!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was late night or should I say early morning pizza. It was a meat lovers & I asked for them to cook it well done, crispy. They obliged without a fuss and even went in search of Parmesan cheese for me. It was the perfect ending meal for a good night. Then I had the eggs Benedict for breakfast another day. Very delicious flavor. I just wish the muffin was crunchy, that would have made it perfect. Wish I had stuck with the food here instead of that awful Flavors buffet the other night. But do get the pizza."}
{"text":"the worst breakfast I've ever had got the bourbon bacon dipped in batter it was half fat the things they call hash browns or some kind of deep fried warmed over I don't know what my wife had some scrambled eggs that I swear we're powdered also had a string in the batter of my food avoid this place keep away unless you want to toss your cookies."}
{"text":"We had just gotten married and went out to the strip. We couldn't decide what to do so we got a snack and drink so we could sit down and decide where we wanted to go. We purchased a fountain drink and a huge donut! I joked and called it my wedding cake but I don't think it was a joke. It was a perfect donut. Enough frosting and light and airy. The cashier was an absolute doll! The pastries here are fresh made and well worth it."}
{"text":"I would come here again.  Walk up to different stations : sandwiches , pizza, sushi, salads, coffee.  Pay at cashier and find your own seat.  Quick, fresh the tossed salad was excellent."}
{"text":"If I didn't know any better, I'd think this food court was simply Harrah's twist on the casino buffet. You have different counters for various cuisines, none done especially well but a step better than they need to be. Prices are on par with casino cafes and unfortunately the sushi is grocery-store grade.  Coffee counter offers Lavazza and subpar baked goods, sandwiches and pizza slices can be assembled or heated to order, froyo flavors are predictable, asian station is slightly above your usual food court vendors (healthier option with fresh veggies!), and the aforementioned sushi counter does offer a prepacked sashimi plate. If you're only a little bit hungry, or with a group, this area is probably an economical option to satisfy all cravings.  Interestingly, the food court offerings seem to be careful not to step on the toes of other resident restaurants: this area does not offer any type of burger, instead signage reminds you that Toby Keith's is right upstairs if you simply must have one."}
{"text":"My favorite place at Happy Harrahs! Morning Menu, Latte, Chinese, and Japanese are just awesome!!  How come no Korean...  Food: Good Price: Good Service: Good Parking: Good"}
{"text":"Staff very friendly and efficient.  Place is clean,  spacious, and full of smiling employees.  Wonderful food selections.  I will definitely return again! (I need to since I can't eat it all in one visit and everything looks delicious)  This trip I had Mac N Cheese. Baked crust breaks open to a creamy cheese macaroni. Excellent comfort food after a long night drinking and gambling.   This morning I gave into temptation and had a cheesecake.  It is worth the calories!  The dense creamy texture is perfect. The graham crust has a nice ratio. The LavAzza dark roasted coffee is wonderful!   I added a little half & half and enjoyed the deep bronze color it turned into. A little bit of happiness in each cup.  My next visit is January 2015. I'm looking forward to what I'll try then. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is the best thing about Harrahs casino. We stopped in to grab lunch before we had to head to the airport. The guy behind the Salad counter sold us on the \"make your own salad\" option. He had to be the nicest person I encountered on my entire trip. He made suggestions on what to put in the salad and even let us try the different dressings before deciding on one. The salad was relatively inexpensive too considering the portion size and the fact this is located in a casino on the strip (I think it was like $10.79). I definitely recommend this place for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"With an array of food options, nothing here really stands out as something I would want to get again. They have pizza, tacos/Mexican, ramen, sandwiches, a bakery and sushi. Prices are on the more expensive side - a sandwich from the bakery, bottle of water and chips come out to over $17. The sushi was decent - not bad quality but not great. While the food court is 24/7, only about two types of food stands are actually open all day - pizza as one of them."}
{"text":"I'm usually quite disappointed with Vegas food courts, but the Fulton Street Food Hall at Harrah's was impressive! I was able to find a healthy vegetarian option -- salad bar -- at a decent price ($12). There is also an Italian coffee bar nearby and the food court itself was clean.   How does it rate on the environmentally friendly scale? Not so good. You'll def be eating out of plastic."}
{"text":"So much variety here! Yes, the food is overpriced but it's also on the Strip at the Harrahs. I've eaten a few things around here and I've had pretty good experiences.  Pizza- Open late night so you can come here and grab and slice or a whole pie. Order at the counter, then go to the cashier and pay, and then go back to pick up the food. The ordering process is not very streamlined, but I guess it works for them. Pretty standard pizza but they heat it up again in the oven so it's hot and has crispy edges if they do it right.   Salad- awesome salad bar. They make it for you, so you don't have to worry about other people contaminating the bar. You can choose your type of lettuce, and add toppings (extra charge for some, so be sure to ask)  Sushi/Noodles- located on the other side. I haven't had the sushi before, so I can't really say how fresh that is. I always go to the noodle bar which has reserved table service, and my favorites are the pad Thai and XO udon noodles. The fried rice is also pretty good too.  Pastry/coffee- your typical hotel pastry box and coffee bar. I had the breakfast burrito and it was alright.   Other foods I haven't tried: taco bar, soups, sandwiches  On the weekend, they close half of the hall and serve a cafe style breakfast. There's usually a line on Saturday and Sunday mornings, so plan your day accordingly. We ordered takeout breakfast and ate it in the room, which was perfectly fine with us. I think my expectations were pretty low, but this food hall isn't bad!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean.  It was easy to get seated and I didn't need a reservation.  I ate breakfast there and the food was fine. The hash brown \"rounds\" were not good: over cooked, not visually appealing and not tasty at all.  I usually love hash browns so I was very disappointed.  The eggs, bacon and toast were good. Standard for anywhere you can get breakfast. The final total with water to drink was $17 and change. Not a good value at all, but centrally located in Harrah's, so it was convenient.  I'm only giving an average rating of three stars, due to the hash browns and the excessive cost."}
{"text":"Not so hungry so we went to Fulton Street Food Hall..! We sat the sushi bar and Hong was our sushi chef we order my usual wonton noodle soup and his two sushi rolls...! Everything was good yes we had iced Lavazza coffee to finish off the meals...! We will be back...!"}
{"text":"Need late night eats that aren't boring? Come to Fulton Street Food Hall! At around 11:30PM, I was looking for food and came here because I wanted to try it out. There's a lot of variety here including tacos, pizza, and asian foods! I went straight for the noodle bar with the intention of eating pho but pho and ramen were not on the menu. No, but I got the pad thai which came out in a few minutes and it was delicious! It was hot hot hot but also quite flavorful. Great considering it's like cafeteria dining. Got my friend the Singaporean style noodle and she enjoyed it. My other friend got the seafood soup and enjoyed that too. Mmm. It's a pretty decent spot for hungry Vegas goers. The price is as expensive as any other Vegas spot but it's delicious and the hours are great. I don't know why they say they are open until 11:30AM on the signs around Harrah's while Yelp says it's open 24/7. I just know it's open until 1AM at least since I did go back and forth a few times. What are the hours? No clue but it's yummy so hit it up if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Fulton Street Food Hall is my favorite place to eat at Harrah's. It might not be a highly competitive award to get, but it matters if you are starving and happen to be at this location! It's like a combination of a cafeteria and food court. All the places inside belong to Harrah's and each of them serves a different type of edible. Everything I have tried has tasted much better than the average cafeteria or even food court options.   I tried the coffee counter for breakfast one day and was pleasantly surprised. I got a flattened burrito - I don't think that is what they call it but that is what it looks like. It had egg, potato, bacon, sausage and more! I added some hot sauce and got a coffee and was good to roll for the rest of my morning. Also - I was super full! It was pretty cheap too.   I went back today and sat at the sushi bar. I wanted to stick to something common - I didn't wanna waste money on something fancy that I may not enjoy. Therefore, I got yellowtail nigiri and a rainbow roll. It was far better than I thought to be. It wasn't the best sushi I have ever tried but in comparison to my expectations it blew me away.  It was fresh and the presentation was pretty! I would come back for this."}
{"text":"I come here a lot for lunch, at least twice a month, while working. It is cafeteria style but you wouldn't know it from the food. They have everything you could ask for. Such as, Mac&cheese, tacos, pizza, chicken parmigian, soup, sushi, sandwiches and salad. They even have a mini coffee and pastry shop and frozen yogurt station.   My go to is usually the salad station. For $11 you get to pick your greens and up to 6 toppings. I have never once finished the salad in one sitting. You definitely should get the dressing on the side and ask for a plate. The soup and pizza are always good. This time I ventured out of my norm due to an intense craving for Mac and cheese. They have a fantastic one with bacon and for a decent sized side of it, you only pay $4 plus tax. It sounds outra5,but let's remember we are on the Las Vegas Strip.   What is really great is that there are so many options that everyone would be happy. Also, the staff is very friendly and always smiling."}
{"text":"Fairly good sushi to eat in or take out at Harrah's Casino.  Other food available as its like a food court.  Prices are a bit costly, but if you have a player's club card, you can get a discount.  I had the tuna roll at about $9.  It was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Kevin at the Noodle and Sushi bar was so great. I embarrassingly didn't have enough for what I ordered. A horrible situation always. But my waiter Kevin was so nice and kind, still brought my food, and had a discount put in so I could cover my bill. And he did it all without making me feel worse than I already did. The Kung Pao chicken was really good. And the hot sake service was great. Definitely a great little foid court on the strip."}
{"text":"Overall I give it a four due to one issue that was quickly resolved but definitely give our server David five stars! He is excellent at his job, so accommodating, and knowledgeable. My mom and I loveddddd the croissant BLT and mine was even better with the added avocado. We ate breakfast at Fulton street three mornings. Definitely a must!! Big props to David for being so understanding of the mishap. He is an awesome employee!!"}
{"text":"I had the pizza burger. Forget what its called. But whoever came up with that idea is a genius! A man named Rigo the cashier was inviting, friendly, and helpful. The staff made the atmosphere friendly which makes the food that much better! Highly reccomend! Affordable prices."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review and I must say I'm extremely dissatisfied with my order at Fulton Street Grill, I went to the salad bar and purchased a salad 10:54am lunch for my salad and I get to home to finish my salad because it was a great portion you get what you pay for; and to my surprise I find a piece of GLASS in my salad!!!!!! You would think something as easy as salad, who would find piece of glass in a salad ! This is completely unacceptable FULTON STREET GRILL! Be safe this Memorial Day Weekend!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here right now eating a salad from the \"Salad Station\" & it is very good. This is a great idea to have a food court with no fast food chains. That's what I'm talking about. Great job, Harrah's!!!"}
{"text":"Yay! Due to my Total Rewards membership, I get comps at Bally, Flamingo and Harrahs all the time.  I like staying in Harrah's since it is smack in the middle of mid-strip.  See my review on it.  The casino itself is boring and the restaurants are not memorable.  A cafe use to be here and they replaced it with a food court instead.  I welcome the change.  First of all, the cafe was slow and bad.  2nd, the food choices are pretty good for a walk up counter service.  Many public seats and tables are set up as well.  Typically, the coffee counter is opened 24/7, but sometimes on the weekend, the back can be opened as well.  A 24/7 bar, coffee bar, pizza bar, ice cream bar, sandwich counter, salad bar and Asian noodles are some of the examples of food."}
{"text":"We stayed at Harrah's and got coffee and breakfast here every morning. Always yummy and satisfying for a quick breakfast snack and then walk a few feet into the casino for a smoke. I found their breakfasts flats and croissant sandwiches quite tasty. The workers were always cheery and friendly as well. I'm happy they had a light roast coffee available along with an assortment of pastries available in the morning. Next time I'll try some afternoon and night food/snacks. It just so happened I was never in the hotel around lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Stayed at Harrah's over the weekend and loved the convenience and abundance of options at this food court. It is hotel pricey but the food is actually not too shabby! I had their Tokyo ramen ($14) and it tasted good - the chashu pork was nice and tender, the broth had rich flavor, and there were plenty of firm noodles. The bowl was very filling. The next day, I had their Mongolian Beef ($16), and the beef was also super tender and made for quite a palatable dish. There's plenty more to choose from: crepes, salads, frozen yogurt, sushi, burgers, snacks, you name it. All my friends enjoyed their food. Fulton Street Food Hall is a very good option for anyone staying here.  Given that it's a sit-down food court (with to-go option), you're not going to get incredibly high-level service - we did have to wait a bit to get their attention when we needed the bill and whatnot when it got busy, but the service was perfectly fine overall. Food didn't take too long to come out either. 4 stars, hip hip Harrah."}
{"text":"Love the variety of food options! Sea food, pizza, salad bar, bakery, frozen yogurt and much more! It's reasonably priced and it's good quality food. It's nice to have a food court that actually has good food and a little for everyone"}
{"text":"I'm here right now with my girl at Vegas. It is Sunday at 2.30am. We are craving ramen , and this place is closed. 24/7? I don't think so..."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre at best, and the prices are outrageous. $17 for a 3 ingredient omelette? I understand that this is the strip in Vegas but really? I had the Classic Eggs Benedict and it was plated well but the hollandaise sauce was a bit too cheesy for my taste, I've definitely had better.  The hash browns are a little funky here too, instead of regular hash browns they have fried slices of seasoned potatoes. A little different but not bad. The omelette was fairly good, but I just can't get over that price tag. The saving grace here was the service, which was super stellar. Our waiter Alberto was attentive, kind, and quickly refilled our drinks before we even had to ask."}
{"text":"This food court is located in Harrah's Hotel in Las Vegas. They have a variety of foods such as pizza, sandwiches, coffee shop, hamburgers, mexican food and a few more stations I can't remember but a really awesome frozen yogurt bar. The food in this court is very good, except the pizza is a bit oily but many of the items are very good. I will not lie the prices here are expensive but since the food is good it is okay. I also love the convenience that they keep one area open 24/7 so if you are hitting the slot machines like me then suddenly realize you haven't eaten for like 6 hours you just literally walk a few feet and you are there. Or if your son can't sleep you go get him some awesome as much as you can eat frozen yogurt and you go back to your slots but you're close enough to see him and wave to him as he eats his endless yogurt and posts to his FB lol.  This food court is always clean they have someone constantly cleaning it 24/7. All the amenities such as forks, napkins and etc are available and well stocked as well as the area is very clean because it can get very busy. The employee's are all very friendly and professional and when you have a special request they do everything they can to accommodate your wishes. Also, if you  have a Total Rewards card please make sure you ask them to scan it because every time you purchase anything in the hotel it builds up points and you can later use those points such as I did to take money off your bill.  So if you are hungry and don't want to go far from your favorite slot machine or you just really want a good sandwich or frozen yogurt this is the place for you especially if you are staying at Harrah's."}
{"text":"Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict & American Breakfast.   The American breakfast was mediocre, but the smoked salmon eggs Benedict was really good! The salmon tasted as expected, eggs were poached well, and the English muffin was a good texture--not tough to chew on. Each dish came with thin slices of potatoes and to be honest, that was the highlight of the meal! The potatoes were crunchy and delicious, just the thing to have before going on a huge hike. I also enjoyed the side of cherry tomatoes and olives. I thought it was a good thing to have to cleanse the palate.   We got here at 8 AM and it wasn't crowded. Although they messed up our order the first time, we didn't have to wait too long for the food to come out.  If there is one thing that I wish was better about the food, it would be the temperature of the food. The potatoes were hot and seemed fresh, but the rest of the meal could have been warmer."}
{"text":"Last three times in Vegas, Boyfriend and I've hit up the noodle bar at the Fulton Street Food Hall.  We're addicted.  We've tried the ramen, the Szechwan beef noodle soup, and the duck noodle soup.  The broths are favorable, the noodle texture is great--they even allowed me to swap out the thin noodles in the beef soup for nice, thick, chewy lo mein noodles.  It's so. So good.  It's expensive, sure.  You know you're on The Strip, right?  Big portions.  Service is fine. Hours for the sushi/noodle bar are 10am-11pm or something similar.     Okay, so, then, after the meal, we decide we want a cup of coffee and head to the coffee bar across the way.  It's about 10 at night at this point.  1 person working, completely unable to multi-task, took 15 minutes to get our coffee to us.  We ordered two iced coffees with flavor syrup in it.  Pump, pour coffee, ice, done.  15 minutes?!  C'mon.  And like $7.  EEP.    5 stars for noodles, 2 stars for coffee..... 4 stars overall.  It evens out, I guess."}
{"text":"We checked in late after working all day.  I was hungry!  We wandered about the food court a bit and finally settled on the Mexican spot.  I ordered beef tacos and the nachos.  I got a little worried when I saw the tortilla chips already set up in plastic boxes and the guy started drizzling beans and then cheese on them.  Reminded me of what you get at the movies, except way more expensive.  The cheese sauce was luke warm as well as the liquid that passed for beans.  Took a few bites and moved on to the tacos.  This was the big mistake of the weekend.  Again, the meat was not kept at an adequate temperature.  They put on some raw onions and grated cheese and called it good.  I took one bite and sadly swallowed it.  I thought, \"this does not taste right\".  Put the plate down and went back to the cashier.  I explained that they might want to replace their meat in the taco bar and that I was starting to feel sick.  She said okay and got a manager to refund the tacos.  It took him over 30 minutes to figure out how to reverse the room charge.  Meanwhile I was standing there, getting sicker and sicker.  Finally he figured it out, and I escaped to my room.  Definately in trouble - I spent my first night in Las Vegas on the bathroom floor, doubled over in pain.  Thank goodness I only took one bite.  P.S. They never did pull the meat from the taco bar."}
{"text":"the bakery at fulton street food hall was a great choice for a light, healthy breakfast.  we were able to get a large fruit salad for $6 that was enough to share between 3 people.  another day, we stopped by for a few parfaits ($5 each) and coffee.  there's plenty of seating and the tables appear to be marble!  i walked around the food hall a few times and the sandwiches, pizzas, salads, and comfort food didn't look too appealing.  i probably could have been talked into getting a slice of pizza, but at about $5-6 per slice and a server with an attitude, i decided to keep walking."}
{"text":"Better sushi than I expected. Great quick bite. Shrimp tempura roll. Check this place out if you want something quick and good."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best roast duck in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs.  (This review is referring to the sit down area of the food hall.)  Came here for breakfast.  Got seated quickly.  With my menu turned over, it took my server 15 minutes to come to my table.  My table which was dirty and covered in food crumbs.  As well as the bench and floor.    Eventually, the waitress comes to my table.  Everything on the menu is extremely expensive.  Imagine a Dennys with ten times worse food with triple the prices.  This is that place.  $16 for 2 paper thin slices of bacon, 2 eggs (sunny side up, hard to mess up), toast, and the most disgusting freezer bag hashbrown \"nuggets\" you have ever seen.  One small bite and the rest were garbage.  Staff was unfriendly and uncooperative.  Don't even ask my why I ate here in the first place.  HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Very rude customer service. We asked for water and they didn't even give us water even though we purchase food at there stall. Some of the cashier are rude and wouldn't accommodate. They need you to dine-in rather than buy off the stall to be served."}
{"text":"As a vegan traveler, what I really want are healthy options and I do mean options.  SO on a 4-day visit where we decided NOT to rent a car but to do everything within walking distance, we were here 3 times.  Twice, we had asian food made to order, and once we had the BIGGEST salad I've had in a long time - fresh lettuce, and a selection of stuff of my own choosing and there was 3X as much as I could have wanted.. but here goes .. lettuce, beets, artichokes, kidney beans, corn, carrots, red peppers, mushrooms, walnuts, almonds, raisins, dates - I'm sure I'm forgetting something - and a good balsamic ..   The pics of the food speak a lot - sorry I didn't get one of this amazing salad - but other vegans, trust me - you can eat well in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This food court is not so nice. The food here just isn't too fresh. Had a breakfast burrito here and a mini donut. The burrito was really small and a little bit too spicy. Didn't taste all that fresh. The mini donut was super small, didn't have much flavor, and was also not so fresh.   Only drop by this place for a small snack if you have no other options. Not so clean either. Would rather get something to eat at Walgreens."}
{"text":"The chinese place is the #1 spot to try here. Fresh and authentic chinese and great quality food. A little expensive at $15 on average, but you can't find a meal on the strip for less than $10."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars, I would. We got food from the noodle and sushi bar. The food is overpriced and not even underseasoned,  just not seasoned at all. The mushrooms were canned, the service was poor, and it's just a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars if everything didn't cost a million dollars.  But for the most part it was decent.  It's a new addition to Harrah's and a good one at that.  It's a sort of fancy food court with all sorts of options.  A salad bar, sandwiches, pastries etc.  The first night I got a make your own salad and my husband got a reuben and some pizza.  All was good but set us back like $50.  But it's Vegas so whatever.  The tables are nice, there is ample seating, and lots of variety.  The next day we stopped there for breakfast and got 2 iced coffees, 2 waters, and 2 breakfast sandwiches.  $38.  Ouch.  I'd advise going to this place if you're real hungry and ok with paying a bit more than other places.  Everything was tasty and fresh, so there's that."}
{"text":"I love this concept.  Giant area with different walk up food places.  I ate at the Noodle place and it was excellent.  I was looking at the menu at the counter and a nice lady asked me if I wanted to eat in or to go.  I told here I was eating in and she asked me to take a seat and relax and she would bring me tea and a menu.  What service!  I ended up getting a big bowl of Duck Soup.  It was the best Duck Soup I have ever had.  I love the Duck soup at the hotel that starts with a V but this was even better!  Crispy skin cooked to perfection with a flavorful duck broth.  The lady said the duck was cooked fresh daily.  Duck Soup with noodles and tea was maybe $13.   I just wish I did not live 300 miles away as I would eat that soup every day!"}
{"text":"Only got dessert here, but still enjoyed the atmosphere and the dessert was delicious. Fairly priced, good food, would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a self serve \"food hall\" but a nice one. There are no chain restaurants just casino run food stations. They offer seating and there is a bar.  Coffee is good  with lots of delicious looking pastries and desserts. They have a nice breakfast menu. They offer burgers, pizza, dogs, soups, sandwiches, burritos,  noodles, sushi and more. But my favorite is the salad bar. They start with a large container of greens and than you pick the numerous items from the salad bar to add to your greens, fresh and lots to choose from. Service is fast and friendly. Throughout our stay we also had coffee, pastry, pizza, cheeseburger, hot dog and fries all were good (pizza was ehh but I'm a fan of NY pizza)  Open 24/7 but not every station is open late."}
{"text":"Not much for options at 2am, so we decided to grab a bite here. I tried the chicken burrito and my wife had pepperoni pizza.  The chicken burrito was overpowered with hot sauce that didn't really have much flavor. It had rice and lettuce, but you couldn't taste anything but sauce.  The pizza was OK. Not bad for the price (per slice). However, the couple in front of us ordered a full pepperoni pizza with jalapeños and when they left to pay, the cook took a pepperoni pizza that was already cooked and sitting out, threw jalapeños on it and recooked it.  They should have been made a fresh pizza."}
{"text":"This is such a great new addition to Harrah's. MUCH better than the downstairs food choices that used to be there. It is cafeteria style where you pick what you want, pay, then pick up your food.   I enjoyed a slice of pepperoni pizza. It was hot & yummy. A perfect little snack. Prices seemed fair for \"Las Vegas\" food. I think it was about $5/slice. They had all sorts of soups, salads, burritos, sandwiches and much more. There is also a whole coffee bar which I want to try next time!"}
{"text":"Super great place if you're staying at Harrahs. They have noodles, sushi, tacos, salad bar, crepes, pizza, comfort food (baked potatoes, soup, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes), dessert, and super great sandwiches. So like everything. It's a tad expensive but that's Vegas. I haven't even tried everything here yet because there's so much!!  Great place when you're staying or playing at Harrahs."}
{"text":"Oh where do I start. First of all, this would have never been our first choice, but we happened to be walking right by it when everyone was tired so we decided on giving it a try. We should have known better. The $27 veggie pizza, was nothing but a pile of bland vegetables with wheel size tomato slices thrown on top of soggy dough. Yes, the pizza was still soggy even after we specifically requested it well, well done and crispy. None of us four could even finish a single slice, so it ended up in the trash, and we had to walk over to the Venetian food court and buy Greek salad and gyros instead. The whole Harrah's casino experience has been nothing but a disappointment for us over the years, from the low quality dining( including buffet) to the old rooms, and customer service."}
{"text":"***review based on our food from Noodle and Sushi place****  My husband was hungover, and I thought we gave this place a try because of all the good reviews... BIG MISTAKE - shouldn't made the decision when I'm hungry... The food is horrible. I ordered the Hong Kong Wonton Soup, California Roll, Tuna Sashimi, and my husband order the Miso Ramen.    Both our soup was so bland, they did not provide any kind of sauce or seasoning to add. We took two bites and we were done. California roll was pre-made ( like what you get from Costco or Sam), Tuna was good (can't really mess up Tuna). Maybe other soup is good there but we are not coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, and you're at Harrah's casino and you hear your tummy rumbling, I suggest coming here!  The variations of food is so good! Their burrito is with the $8. Not only are they delicious, hearty and spicy but it can feel two people! Pizza slices are huge! Burgers are to die for! Oh and I highly suggest the Tokyo Ramen. My dad had never tried Ramen, and he was expecting the instant Ramen Maruchan flavor, but he was floured with how flavorful the broth was and the noodles were perfect or as he will say, \"al dente\"!"}
{"text":"My fiance is Thai and rice is a staple in our home. This fried rice was fresh and you got a lot for the price on the strip. We highly recommend the noodle place for something cheap and good."}
{"text":"Visited the salad bar and it's good. You get different choices of greens then 5 toppings including artichoke hearts, quinoa, cooked Brussels sprouts, eggs, garbanzo beans, and other veggies. Your choice of cheese and unlimited finishing (sun dried tomatoes, walnuts, almonds, tortilla chips). Add protein like chicken, Ham, or shrimps for extra $3. Yes $14 is a lot for a salad but portion is big and it's the strip. Server was friendly."}
{"text":"Quick, fast and cheap without sacrificing quality. Not many cheap places like this left on the strip. Definitely a good stop if your in the area.  I don't know that I would go out of my way to get there, worth a stop though for more gambling fuel."}
{"text":"We had a $35 hotel credit to use, so we used it here. Not sure how fresh the food is bc it is made in the morning and sits on display all day long. Once you make a selection they heat it up for you. I got the spinach and cheese Stromboli ($12). Upon ordering, they brush it with butter and sprinkle Parmesan on top. It comes with marinara for dipping. It was pretty good and very filling. It was a bit on the oily/greasy side, however. I also got a Ruben at the sandwich place. I shared it bc it was really big and was loaded with meat($13). Both meals were satisfying and we could use our hotel credit, making the experience even better. Without the credit, I would say the prices were a little high, but the convenience makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Brought back a caramel apple & it was black with mold in the inside. Good thing we cut into it and didn't take a bite out of it!"}
{"text":"I had 3 items: a slice of meat lovers pizza, Bizzburger, and a chocolate gelato pop.  The pizza was very cheesy and saucy, i swear all the pizza places on the Strip smell and taste good! the gelato pop was meh, it was noting special as it was like a chocolate fudge popsicle.  I wouldn't recommend the Bizzburger, it was so fatty and filling. I did not really taste anything but just having a bite of it, made me feel very unhealthy.  Customer Service was good like any other places i've been in Vegas."}
{"text":"My wife and I just experience the most rudest short hair elderly oriental waitress. She was very loud and would not accommodate our order of miso soup. We went there 2 times before and the gentleman accommodated my wife wishes of a bowl of miso soup. But this very rude and loud short hair elderly oriental waiteress would not accommodate our order. So I very loudly in front of everyone told my wife \"LETS NOT EAT HERE ANYMORE\" we stood up and walked out. I have a believe that in the food business if its some small and it can be accommodating then service your customers. Besides once you loose a customer it very hard to win that customer back. \"CUSTOMERS COMES FIRST BECAUSE IF ITS NOT FOR US WHO IS PAYING THERE WAGES AND BENIFITS."}
{"text":"Pizza = AMAZING. Huge, huge slices. Noodle bar was really awful. The beef was disgustingly chewy and the noodles were not good. Skip the noodle bar, get pizza or sandwiches."}
{"text":"I stopped for breakfast after checking out. It was busy but not as busy as the Starbucks down the hall. I had a regular coffee and egg, cheese, and sausage croissant. They heated up the sandwich in a small oven so it was crisp on the outside but nice and warm on the inside. The coffee was really good, too. Yes, it is pricier than what you would pay at a local coffee shop a few blocks over but that's the strip for you."}
{"text":"We stayed at Harrahs on the strip and was looking for a place to get a quick bite to eat. We stopped in after a show and had a quick bite to eat. The food looked really good and we decided to come back for breakfast in the morning. We had coffee and muffins and they were really good. The selection for breakfast included donuts, scones, other great items breakfast sandwiches. The prices were about average and the cafe was very clean. I'd recommend Fulton St to anyone looking for breakfast, lunch, or a quick snack."}
{"text":"Per the Harrahs website, this is a chef driven dining option. That's a big lie. Everything is pre-prepared and it tasted like microwave meal. I ordered the Tokyo ramen ($14)-- it's not real authentic broth, just salty water with msg. The ramen was stuck, which means that it's been sitting around for a while. The pork was dry. I also ordered a sushi (8). It was 6 little pieces. The rice was hard. Hubby ordered the roast beef sandwich ($11), which looked really delicious and big. It turns out that they use very fluffy bread. It only came with a few slices of roast beef.  Hubby also got potato skins($6); it was tasteless, chewy and sad looking. Lastly, we also got the bacon Mac and cheese($6), which looked really yummy. Wrong again. It was loaded with salty, and tons is floor. You could barely taste the cheese.  I also bought a bottle of naked juice ($5) We spent about $50.  Shame on us for selecting this place. Should have just lined up for a buffett."}
{"text":"This place is full of variety of food: Mexican, Asian, sushi, breakfast, frozen yogurt. The boyfriend and I ate hot dog, pizzas. For the price, it was not the best. However, on Sunday morning I had the breakfast omelette flat, aaaaanddd it was soooo goood! I loved it! I'm not a breakfast person, so it says a lot. Monday morning, I bought another one to eat before taking my flight back home. A plus to this place for being open early."}
{"text":"Visited in Sept 2015 & Aug 2017. Set up like a dining hall with several options. Food isn't bad, just pricey. You'd be better off to hit a buffet if you're looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This makes a nice \"go to\" spot when buffets or pricey restaurants are getting old. We had the sushi and noodles. Nice staff, good quality sushi. We also loved the baked goods and Lavazza coffee bar. Try the macaroons and cannoli. Fairly reasonable prices by LV standards, and better than a food court."}
{"text":"Ordered a whole pizza to go. Even tip them few bucks! I paid $36 for that damn thing!  so at least have the decency to put the toppings I paid for ON IT! Got 5 spinach leaves with 7 peppers, and crumbles of jalapeños! Ridiculous. When u order whole pizza, make sure the older black gentleman makes your pizza and not the white tall guy. Obviously, he doesn't give a sh*t. Every other time I ordered pizza here, the older gentleman provided excellent customer service and \"to die for pizza\"! He is an honest hardworking man who deserves respect and recognition."}
{"text":"My breakfast was what I expected. My two friends got biscuits and gravy with sausage and it was terrible. The biscuits were hard not soft, they were dry and the sausage was so fake. Our waitress was nice but another worker was very unhelpful when we were confused with the layout and how to be sat down."}
{"text":"Because I always stay at Westgate, I generally drive my rental car and park at Harrah's to enjoy being on Center Strip at least one night each visit to Las Vegas.  Sure, now I pay $7 for four hours of parking in that garage, but that's still not bad AND it is better than the roundtrip price to ride that shuttle to/from Westgate.  I've walked through Harrah's for years now and have seen the many upgrades to the main casino floor area.   Fulton Street Food Hall was one of them and always caught my eye, so I finally decided to stop and actually check it out.  I like the classic black/white clean look, all the different areas and the good variety available.  Yelp Elite Stefany V seems to have the right idea when she said it has all the look of a casino buffet, but you can just buy anything a la Carte at each counter based on what you want.  That and there's a very nice bar as part of the offerings in this area.  It always seems incredibly clean to me too.  While you cannot get everything when it comes to food options, it is perfect if you're hungry and not exactly sure what you want. Or if you just want something to hold you over before a bigger meal a few hours later at any of the various other options nearby.  Sure, many items are priced in line with buying food on the Las Vegas Strip. However, there's value to be found at the bakery counter as I enjoyed what they called a \"Mini Ice Cream Sandwich\" for just $3.  Look at the picture for yourself. There's nothing mini about it. I had my choice of four different flavors in cookies, two different gelatos and the finished product was more than enough to hold me over until dinner much later in the night.   The employee working that counter was incredibly nice and obviously made sure I got plenty of gelato. Just delicious.  Your mileage may vary on other items in the Food Hall, but I just like having options and this part of Harrah's gives me about as many in one spot as I'm going to find anywhere on Center Strip without paying for an entire buffet that I can't eat."}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing! Love the bacon dipped in pancake batter and cooked to perfection! Service was awesome, plenty of food. Perfect. Oh and the vanilla bourbon syrup was off the wall."}
{"text":"* Please note: This was intended to be my first Yelp in December, 2017 but I didn't sign up until a few days ago.   Here we were at the Fulton Street Food Hall again. In a place that seemed to have everything, we would head straight to the Noodle Bar every single time. This place has been an inviting spot where my hubby indulged in his favorite, the Roast Duck Noodle Soup.  Without even looking at the menu, hubby ordered the Roast Duck Noodle Soup once more. It was served in a big bowl full of firm noodles topped with aromatic roast duck and Chinese baby bok choy. Couldn't guess what the duck marinade was; it was simply fragrant. In addition, the rich broth was seasoned just right. Everything was fresh and delicious. Hubby thought this was as good as the ones from San Francisco's Chinatown. Yes, it was a little pricey, but why fuss about it? We were on The Strip after all.  Tip #1: The medium-sized roast duck pieces were perfectly cleaver-chopped. However, these might be difficult to manage if you're not used to chopsticks. It'll be helpful to ask for an extra plate, a fork, and a knife to start.  My choice was the Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodles this time. What have I tried before? Vegetarian Buddha's Delight, Ma Po Tofu, Beef Chow Fun, and Chicken Fried Rice. I liked them all, especially the fried rice.  The noodle dish looked and smelled so good but I was a tad disappointed that it came to our table already cool to the touch. Regardless, it was delicious. I love that the noodles were crisp yet soft on the parts covered with sauce. Chicken breast pieces were tender and perfectly flavored. And the baby bok choy? Richly verdant. Fresh and crunchy, the way we cook it at home. It was also priced a little high, but after a happy meal like this, who cares?  Tip #2: The Noodle Bar cuts its baby bok choy the usual Chinese way. That is, cut it lengthwise into 2 (or more) pieces. If using the chopsticks proves unwieldy, ask for an extra plate, a fork, and a knife.  Overall, this was a 5-Star dining experience for us. Attentive service, adequate portions, tasty food, and clean dining area. There was much to impress us. It's remarkable that The Noodle Bar managed to be consistently good in this fast-paced food hall setting. And, if you're into sports, just look up at the screens in front of you. No sound, but plenty of action.  We'll be back! Next time, I'll try to convince hubby to order something else."}
{"text":"Great addition to Harrah's!  Very well laid out self service food court with lots of choices.  We kept it simple for lunch and had a sandwich and a fresh salad, each about $10.  The salad bar is excellent.  We chose spinach and our 6 toppings and it was large enough for two people!  The coffee bar and bakery looked great, as did the frozen yogurt, noodle shop, sushi, and pizza!  Consider the cost of fast food, the prices for their freshly prepared food was very reasonable."}
{"text":"\"\" Unbelievable Presentation and Flavors ! \"\"  On our latest trip to Harrahs Casino in Las Vegas, my wife and I visited the brand new Fulton Street Food Hall. The variety of food items offered, and the presentation of the food was so impressive. They have a variety of fresh baked brick oven Pizza. An unbelievable looking and tasting Deli sandwich station. A Fruit and vegetable rack were you can also order Salads. Many types of freshly made Sushi, and delicious looking Breads, Desserts. The Fulton also has a wide variety of Drink items you can enjoy. A fantastic new addition to the Casino, which allows you the freedom to go to any venue, and enjoy what ever you want, in a beautiful setting with a large amount of tables and chairs to sit back and relax in. A must visit at Harrahs Las Vegas        Visited November 2014"}
{"text":"My five star YELP rating is entirely based on my SALAD experience.  This is probably my fifth visit to the Fulton Street Food Hall to meet a friend who works at Harrah's for lunch.  I am a clean healthy eater and was happy to discover their great salad station in the back.  I have only eaten at the salad bar portion of the food hall, so I cannot speak to anything else.    Now the salad is going to set you back approximately $11, but for that you get good quality ingredients and a sizable portion.  You communicate with the culinary salad staff your lettuce preference and then you pick six toppings, from red beans, to peas, to carrots, to beets, to tofu, to cheese to proteins (there are probably 25 options to pick from with your six)...over six items and there is an additional charge.  You select your dressing and toppings like nuts, dried fruits or croutons (no extra charge) and the staff tosses all together for you.  They then repackage for you a the giant plastic bowl (to eat there or also could be taken to go).    My salad experience at Fulton Street is always fulfilling to my belly and satisfying to my effort to eat clean and healthy where I can."}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast and couldn't have been happier.    Service for getting coffee was extremely quick, which is not what we have been encountering in the City.  The server came and took our order and food came in a timely manner.  I had the BLT croissant which came with seasoned steak fries.   The croissant was not all buttery and flaky which was a good thing because you could eat it as a sandwich.   There was plenty of bacon and nice crisp, fresh lettuce.  I opted for no tomatoes, so it was perfect for me.  My husband had scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage and toast.   The eggs were in a small dish which he really liked, and it looked like way more than 2 eggs.  The sausage patties were perfect and he is a huge sourdough toast fan, so he was a happy trooper.   He wasn't crazy about the hash browns which were silver dollar sized potatoes.   Only other issue we had was that the coffee wasn't really hot, but it wasn't a deal breaker and could easily be fixed.  Prices are comparable to other breakfast places, so close to $40 for us. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"The price you pay to eat in a casino, you would think to get the service included. This review is strictly for the service!   Maybe we thought wrong, my wife and I decided to grab a bite before checking out of the hotel. It avoided going out on the strip.   It wasn't too busy, which was a good thing. Our order was then taken but, without a smile. Maybe it was too early in the morning, who knows. The food then came out, she gave me my plate but seemed to have just slammed it on the table, I thought it slipped out of her hand but then she went on and put every other plate down with the same force as the first.   Overall, the food was delicious, maybe ordered a little bit too much then I was able to eat."}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible food. Would give zero stars if possible. Asked for a spoon and bowl and was told by the manager that I had to use the plastic ware because we weren't dining in.... but we were. When we pointed this out, he said it was \"too late, you should have ordered from me\".  the food was meh at best. wtf."}
{"text":"$8 for a frozen frappe??  This is one of those times when I knew I made a mistake before I even ordered but foolishly did it anyway.  It was late, starbucks was closed, and I needed a caffeine pick up to keep my night going strong.  First the cashier was not friendly at all and even copped an attitude when I changed my mind about the whipped cream.  Secondly it took forever for them to make my drink.  And lastly it was the worst frappe I have ever had  along with the most expensive. (tasted like bottom barrel coffee and super watered down)... a 7-11 $1.80 iced coffee tastes way better than this."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on a Sunday morning and got immediate seating for 5. I got the classic French toast and it was good. Good portion size. Someone else in my party got hash browns as a side and those were really good too."}
{"text":"Sushi was amazing. However, I can't find the business for their taco and burrito counter. I'm leaving the reviews here. Best Reto ever. And I'm from LA. Get chicken or steak"}
{"text":"Gave it three because the food is good which something is wrong if u screw up eggs, sausage and toast..well a slice of mines was slightly burnt but the other was good enough for me...it was just ridiculous to pay $60 for breakfast..we didn't have a choice cause nothing else was open...  At dinner we went back because we wanted to try noodle bar and this wasn't bad..we got the beef tendon noodles, Osaka ramen and pad Thai..two was bland but the pad Thai was awesome!"}
{"text":"Fulton Street Food Hall doesn't offer the best quality but they do offer a good variety of food. If you want pizza or tiramisu at 1:00 am you can conveniently pick that up at the food hall. There are various options like pizza, pastries, cakes, burgers and even sushi. The Food Hall is pretty much Harrah's own food court. I haven't tried the sushi but I did pick up a slice of pizza here earlier this week. After a few cocktails and no luck on the slots I stop by to grab a slice of Veggie Pizza.   The cost for a slice is $7.00 which is average for Vegas standards. To be honest, I had better pizza than this. I think the pizza at Costco taste way better than this. I guess they're hoping that the customers are way intoxicated to judge the freshness and taste of the food. All they're doing is just reheating the pizza. I have no idea how long that pie been sitting on the counter. The only reason I am giving them a generous three stars is because my enjoyed his cannoli and danish. I guess one bad and one good experience equals A-OK."}
{"text":"I had the sushi and it wasn't very good at all. Didn't taste very fresh and it was crazy overpriced for what you get. Service was slow and we were the only 2 people and not very friendly. Not sure I could say much more.   Note- I did later have a cannoli from the front display and it was glorious."}
{"text":"What are you craving for? They havhave his a variety of different foods. This place is located at Harrahs. They lost stars because they close early. I mean, atleast leave the noodle place open 24 hours! Definitely worth to try the Tokyo Ramen. Pizza is also good but it is GINORMOUS !!!!"}
{"text":"Fulton is located inside Harrah's and the only time I came was at 2 am when we were too lazy to look for places to eat. A pepperoni and sausage pizza is individual size and cost $15. Come on Vegas, I could get 3 medium sized pizza at Dominos for $15. But hey, when in Vegas you spend twice and three times as much. Luckily, the pizza was delicious and greasy. You have to order at the pizza counter first, they give you a ticket to pay and then you come back with the receipt to wait for your pizza.   They also have a salad bar to choose from, desserts, coffee, frozen drinks, frozen yogurt, sandwiches and a bar with its own menu. I would definitely come back here next time especially if I am staying at Harrahs again. It is a little on the pricey side but when your tummy is growling, you can't help yourself. Staff is very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"If your passing through Harrah's Casino from exiting the monorail and trying to get to the Vegas Strip and you want a sugar fix honey, this is the stop,  all the sweet treats your happy little heart desires! Loved all the lovely selections and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I wish we had found this earlier. Ate here on our last day on the strip, and I was so happy to see a SALAD BAR! There are several food stations with cafeteria-style walk up, where you pay at a register at the end. The sandwich place here was a great deal - a big deli sandwich for $10-12 that isn't Subway? For the Strip, this is a steal! I had a giant bagel sandwich with smoked salmon and it did NOT skimp on the salmon! There is also a taco bar, noodle bar, sushi stand, and aforementioned salad bar. The sushi looked kind of meh, but if you need a fix it will do. This is a great place for a quick lunch where everyone can get what they want and not break the bank."}
{"text":"It is allllll about the sushi here folks!  However I have yet to try the noodle bowls but they seem popular.  And the pizza is not too shabby.  The dessert bar is a great place to end your meal (the home-made gelato pops are the bomb).   I surprisingly crave this quick and easy sushi. It has been the same sushi chef every time I have gone; the sushi is SO FRESH and rolled perfectly tight, not over-packed with rice at all.  Best/most cost-effective sushi on the strip 100%   Yes it is a food-court BUT Harrahs is doing something right here and I love it."}
{"text":"Everytime we come to Vegas we come here to the noodle bar. Fresh delicious ingredients. We like this better than the great wok at MGM and the other Asian restaurant at Caesars.  You can order at the counter or be waited on; so it doesn't seem as fancy as other places , but the food is the best. Highly recommend the Hong Kong noodles with shrimp."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible food and service, they really don't care what they do or serve. Stay away place"}
{"text":"My daughter got tacos here and she liked them.  But what was even better was the Asian food.  Fresh fried rice, piping hot.  I ordered the shrimp fried rice.  Shrimp was okay, not the best quality.  The fried rice with egg and fresh veggies was sooooooo good.  I'm still thinking about it.  Will definitely get some more when I return in April.  Was not expecting the food to be that good and it was very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"For Las Vegas, I was not impressed with this hotel's cafe. I needed to grab breakfast quickly before my flight so we sat at the bar and was told the kitchen would be closing in 30 minutes. We waited more than 30 minutes before our food came out. When the bartender brought my food out, he had brought out the wrong dish. I ordered the breakfast skillet, however the bartender thought I ordered the American breakfast. My friends also asked me, \"Didn't you order the skillet?\" The bartender asked if I wanted to take it back, I told him it was okay because I didn't want to wait any much longer. I was really understanding about it too. The bartender apologized and walked away. The American breakfast comes with potatoes, eggs, and a side of meat. I choose bacon. Potatoes were bland, eggs were bland, and the bacon was soft. I felt that the only thing that was freshly cooked on that plate were my eggs. Potatoes and bacon were probably sitting under a heating bin. I love my bacon crispy..this bacon was rubbery and flimsy. My friend ordered the french toast, which was pretty tasty.  I would have thought the bartender would have given my breakfast for free, for his screw up, but he still charged me.. definitely not coming back here."}
{"text":"It was 11:30am and my husband and I were really hungry and we wanted breakfast. As we stood next to the bar a man (big guy) asked if we need help, and we told him we were wanting breakfast but they were closed. He said that's okay, have a seat we will get you breakfast. He was very very kind. We appreciate him very much. The food came quickly and the food was good. We like harrah's. Very nice people working there."}
{"text":"Absolutely surprised at how good this was. I was expecting typical Vegas Casino food in this restaurant but wow! We split the Classic Eggs Benedict between us and thank god because there was enough food for a meal for both. The hollandaise was light and lemony, the egg perfectly cooked and runny but th e best was the hash browns. Little round seasoned potatoes pancakes that had amazing flavor. Coffee and hot chocolate was myeh but otherwise great!"}
{"text":"Heaven on earth can be found smack in the middle of this \"food court\". After loading up on dinner, head to the 'Coffee & Sweets' counter. Abdul makes what may be the best cup of coffee and offers some of the tastiest treats you'll find on the strip! Huge Donuts, Tarts and Cookies galore line the treats counter.   Order a flavor shot with your coffee to kick it up a notch and lay low in the only \"quiet\" spot in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My experience was a great one and I would recommend going to Harrah's or it's affiliates you won't be disappointed. Loved every minute of my stay in vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Finding a decent place on The Strip to have breakfast is becoming more challenging every year! Yes, nearly every casino hotel has a buffet. However, if you prefer your food freshly made, with hot food items served hot and cold food items served cold, then you should look elsewhere.  Many of the major hotel casino's on The Strip have closed their Cafe's as the margins are thin. Harrah's has not yet close their Cafe and we are very happy about this.   Although nothing fancy, the restaurant hits all of the items on a good breakfast restaurant's checklist. Good food served hot, a varied menu that included lunch/brunch items as well as traditional breakfast food items. Prices are very reasonable, especially considering the location and service is decent."}
{"text":"Unpretentious Sushi place on the strip, next to it is a sandwich station, then there's the salad bar which is pretty amazing, you pick your greens, give it to the chef and pick your fav add on from grilled asparagus, variety of fresh veggies to your meats which includes seared tuna (add charge), grilled chicken, etc. Definitely had better salad offering than Serendipity (not that they're known for their salad but was half it's price, half the wait time and 10x better in taste!)... Lastly their coffee shop and dessert station - TO.DIE.FOR! I'm not huge on pastries but I tried the Neapolitan, mouthwatering! And it's big enough to share had it with cappuccino and I was set! Chef driven food hall! Highly recommended! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Visited about 10pm. Peggy at the noodle bar gave great recommendation. Great service and good food.  Pizza was not good though. I wouldn't waste money or calories."}
{"text":"Ate at the noodle bar. Very good service and the food was really good as well. There was plenty of seating so you don't feel cramped. Prices are a little high at about $17 a plate but overall I was happy with my meal."}
{"text":"I never review any restaurant,  but the Noodle Bar is very good for a Hotel Quick Bite. The HK Pan Fried Noodles with Shrimp was delicious.  Also the Beef Broccoli was fantastic. I will now always come to eat here while visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"It is inside Harrah's casino ground floor, has sushi, noodle soup, hot dog, pizza , soup & salad bar, Asian food menu, a full service bar, huge sitting area, big screen tv, I try their foot long hot dog & sushi, pretty good"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Harrah's for 4 days and nights. We went to the bar at Fulton Street and were greeted by Shawn, the bartender. He was so nice and welcoming that we continued to go see him the next few nights that we were there. Unfortunately, the last night that we were there, we didn't get to see him. So we hope that this review gets to him. We just want to say thank you very much for taking care of us. We will never forget you. And also a big thank you to Mitchell and the other bartender for taking care of us while Shawn wasn't there. You guys are awesome."}
{"text":"This is a semi food court in Harrah's.  There are several options:  pizza, sandwiches, Mexican food, breakfast, pastries, coffee, etc.  I went on a Sunday afternoon looking for a fresh fruit smoothie (it is incredibly difficult to find fresh fruit on the Las Vegas strip).  When I arrived, several of the spots were closed, but the location that has coffee, pastries, sandwiches, and Mexican food was open.  They had a triple berry smoothie for $6, you can add fresh fruit for $2.  But, the only fresh fruit they had was a banana, so I added that.  The smoothies are premade and frozen, so when you order they pull a frozen bag of pureed fruit out of the freezer and blend it up with some water.  The woman was not sure what else goes into the smoothie, but there was definitely some sort of dairy based product in there.  For $6 it was not cheap considering the ingredients but it was way better than the other smoothie options I found nearby, which were basically non-existent.  I will definitely give it another try.  The sandwiches/breakfast items in the case looked good as well.    Fulton Street is not going to provide you with an unforgettable meal, but you can get something quick that is not from a fast food chain.  So, it serves its purpose well."}
{"text":"Very nice stress to enjoy a good meal. I'm not a sushi eater. However I see everyone around me enjoying their sushi. So must be good. I ordered the chicken & broccoli. Very tasty. Just the right proportion to have enough and do not have left over.   The cost is reasonable for Vegas prices."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious! This was eggs with ham steak, hashbrowns, and wheat toast. My girlfriend and I split breakfast and just ordered one of this, but Linda brought out two plates and just cut the ham in half so I got a full breakfast! Such a nice gesture. Linda was very nice while serving us. I love having breakfast here because it's simple and right outside the hotel room. This was about $16."}
{"text":"There's no bones about it - the noodle bar is a complete shit show.  Their ordering process is confusing. Everything else in the food court is walk-up.  The customer assumes that to be the case here too. And it is. But you can also sit down at tables for table service.  But it's not clear at first.  After the confusing exchange at the counter I went to sit down for table service. Except I couldn't cause every single table was covered with dishes from people who had already left.  I found the least disgusting table and was more/less ignored for 5-10 minutes as two servers were \"in the weeds\" with 3-4 other 1-top or 2-top tables.  As the server greeted me, he asked if I had ordered. I said I had. Then he left to go back to the kitchen...to confirm my order with the girl at the counter.  He came back and informed me she had not taken my order and asked what I would. I said I would like for this table to be cleaned and then ordered.  The other tables around me remained covered with dishes, food, used napkins and just general filth for my entire meal. It was a bit gross.  I contemplated cancelling my order because if it's this nasty out front I can't imagine what the back of house looks like.  I finally got a drink! But...my appetite is pretty much gone so now I'm writing this review. About $30 for a Coke, mediocre pad thai and some of the worst service I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Had the chicken cashew nut was the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten they boiled the chicken very bad consistency texture and flavor don't waste your money eating your non-edible"}
{"text":"After a late night in Vegas, I stopped in Harrah's to specifically go to the noodle bar. I have heard great things from it and wanted to try it out. I ordered the mapo tofu and beef chow fun to-go. The cashier was super friendly and made sure we had everything we needed when we left. The food was ready roughly around eight minutes, and the portions were big. Vegas is known to have overpriced food, but this noodle bar had good prices in exchange for great quality service, food, and portions. I really enjoyed both dishes and would definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Now this place has the best egg white breakfast meal that I have had and the seasoned potato hash browns are phenomenal.. In the evening the sushi bar food is oh soooo delicious . I had the fried rice dish with no egg and it was way good and lots to eat..very good..this is our place for breakfast in Vegas.  Even better are the TV's that they have in full view to watch any sports and cooking channel stuff that is going on.  Of course, as soon as you step out of the place, machines are calling your name.  gotta luv it"}
{"text":"Located in Harrah's, this food court has lots of options. It's closer to the back of the hotel than the front, so the smell of the casino isn't as bad here. It's well lit and modern, unlike the rest of the casino. It's not a bad place to grab something to eat. They make everything fresh. I had a breakfast wrap one morning and also tried their like bowl.   They also have noodles, pizza, sandwiches, crepes, and coffee. If you aren't staying at Harry's, I wouldn't bother with walking through the casino to get here. It's decent if you are staying at hotel and want something quick to eat."}
{"text":"Fulton Street Food Hall is a very impressive food court located at Harrah's offering various selections throughout the day.  Some of the many selections are sandwiches, soups, salads, and Asian food (chow mein, Pho).  There is even a dessert bar.  Of course, there is a coffee bar.  I went here a little over a week ago after going to the nearby Strabucks, but finding that they were not open yet.  I ordered a medium latte. Excellent!  The service by the barista was exceptional. Very courteous and very friendly.  Most of all, there are plenty of seating.   Therefore, you should not have a problem finding available tables and chairs.  Finally, what sets this food court from the others is that there is even a bar.  Yes, there is a bar!  And there are several TV's which had sports games on.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Decent spot if you are staying at Harrahs but nothing special. I like the food hall concept which offers a variety of options. They have multiple sections including coffee, bakery, pizza, noodles and desserts. You can probaby find something that will satisfy you here but don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"WOW is all I can say, was expecting fast food style but this was great. The Ramen was amazing and so delicious. I took my 2 of my kids and their friend here for dinner while we were in Vegas for the night, they had never had REAL Ramen that wasn't instant. they were so surprised and loved every bit of it."}
{"text":"My friends and I were hungry and saw this was one of the only places open late at night around 2am.  We went to the pizza section and ordered.  My friends and I ordered the Supreme and Pepperoni pizzas.  We seemed to have waited in line forever.  The cashier guy wasn't smart.  Someone had given one customer a supreme pizza when she ordered a pepperoni.  My friends and I were watching him.  He later tried to give us the pizza the lady returned.  Ummm no you don't!  The other worker heard us bickering about it to the cashier guy and got the hint.  He gave us a fresh box of pizza.  Glad someone was smart and paying attention.  smdh."}
{"text":"I feel like this place is a bit underrated. Good balance between location, price, and quality. Will definite eat here again if I stay at Harrah's"}
{"text":"Looks nice. Friendly staff but took forever to get my food. Wish I never stepped foot in here. Bought a whole pizza because the lady said it was cheaper than buying 4 slices. Both me and my friend got food poisoning from this crap. I feel horrible. I know it was the food, because I haven't eaten much of anything else and we both got sick. I suggest passing on this one unless you like throwing up from both ends for days at a time. Just awful!"}
{"text":"This rating is just based on the food. I went to the noodle bar and ordered the Hong Kong Wonton Noodle Soup. The soup is bland and costs $13. Disappointing. Go somewhere else for noodle soup."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Soft Serve Samples - Southern Butter Pecan.

Using a well stocked gaming bar as one anchor while fanciful pastries glow behind glass at a coffee bar near the other end towards escalators to the garage the Food Hall cannot be fully appreciated in a single visit, but over the course of twelve-hours the full breadth of the spread offers everything from Noodle Soups and Sushi to Breakfast Plates and Pizza, the Soft-serve station another popular option while Salads, Sandwiches, and \"Comfort Foods\" each offer options for diners on the go.  Admittedly only taking looks at 3 of 8 stations, my predilection to sweets obvious in the ordering, a stop by the pastry counter may prove daunting to the uninitiated, but taking into account that all items are made \"once or twice\" daily according to servers the best bet is either arriving early morning or choosing items with less time sensitivity, the miniature donuts far too dry when sampled late evening Friday while a Frisbee-sized Jumbo the morning after was pillowy soft, sweet, and the slightest bit yeasty, albeit expensive at $7.  Not particularly taken by the cookies, all three more sugary than necessary which led to the flavors trending mostly 'same-same,' both the dense chocolate Ding-Dong knockoff and rich peanut butter brownie were a step in the right direction, the latter almost too rich for one person though an accompanying cup of coffee will certainly aid the cause.  Expecting it a mistake even before ordering the $5 Almond Croissant it took only two bites to confirm the combination of poor proofing and sticky Frangipane as a disaster and casting the rest into the nearest receptacle before sitting down to proper breakfast it was with good fortune that not a bite more stomach space had been wasted since both the Chef's Special Pancakes and Fruit and Nut studded French Toast were amongst the Strip's more impressive examples, each offered the beneft of completely unanticipated pure Maple Syrup.  Brought up on Soft-serve, but generally not going out of my way for the stuff, it was mostly the uniqueness of flavors that led me to order a $6 cup late in the evening and although samples of flavors including Island Candy Bar, Birthday Cake, and Moose Tracks were all quite pleasant the blend of Southern Pecan and Peanut Butter Cup entitled Butter Cup was absolutely exquisite, a flavor something like salted French Butter that mixed well with banana chips and crunchy housemade honey granola.  ***A touch more spendy than it should be, but trying far harder than need be, Fulton Street Food Hall goes to show that the Casinos are at least thinking about the quality of their food as part of the overall 'experience in 2015, a trend that both tourists and locals can only hope will continue to grow."}
{"text":"Inside Harrah's you'll find a food court that contains no fast food chains. For a quick bite that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, this is a great spot to stop and eat. We found it as we got off the monorail station located in this hotel. What impressed me the most was the healthy options here. They had a noodle bar, a sushi bar, pizza place, dessert/wraps place, froyo, and a build your own salad spot. We enjoyed the build your own salad spot, which included 6 toppings, and choice of greens for $10. Meat is extra. The ingredients were fresh and they had some interesting toppings, like fig. My salad was huge and I couldn't even finish it all, I was so full! They also offered baked potatoes which we tried on another visit as well. Since our hotel's food court only offered fast food like McDonald's, hot dogs, pizza and no late night eateries, we found ourselves hopping on the monorail for a quick, healthy and affordable meal.  Another plus? This place is open 24/7!"}
{"text":"Still giving it 5 stars. After a long weekend of watching football and drinking beer, it's safe to say we ate here about 4 times. It's easy, it's fast, it is soooo convenient. Most of all, it's good! It can be a bit pricey, but it's Vegas, everything is pricey here.   On the 1st day I had the Tokyo ramen. It was good!  2nd day we had breakfast. A breakfast crepe with bacon, cheddar cheese, scrambled eggs then drizzled with maple syrup and powdered sugar. My fiancé has never liked a sweet and savory combination, but he absolutely loved this. It was very good! The guys who were working were very nice.   Later that day we had their pizza. It was thin but still doughy. Just the right amount of both. We loved it! The guys who worked here were very nice too!  We also had a breakfast wrap with egg and cheddar wrapped in a flour tortilla. It honestly looked like a homemade AM Crunchwrap from Taco Bell the way it was put together. And it was soooo good. The perfect drunk munchy."}
{"text":"The overall aesthetics of this food hall is pretty welcoming. There is a noodle place, pizza, bar, bakery, and sushi spot located inside. I only visited the noodle section. It was really packed with people. i suppose the cold weather forced people to look for something warm to keep their energy going. The service was a little disappointing because there was not enough servers. Food was good though. My family and i tried the different noodles with rice. As for the other places, they seem appetizing."}
{"text":"We came to the noodle bar for a quick bite to eat. We were greeted by a nice waitress immediately upon seating ourselves. The food got to our table extremely fast, which took us by surprise. And everything tasted absolutely amazing. I got a vegetarian rice with vegetables and it tasted so good. Definitely would recommend coming here to eat. The sushi bar could be better, I think though."}
{"text":"I stopped here before heading to the airport to get some Pad Thai to go. They had a large variety of food stands/restaurants which is pretty nice especially if you're dining with a group of people with different tastes. I definitely like the open environment concept.   The Pad Thai want bad. It was pretty spicy which made it better, but overall, nothing to write home about.  As far as food in Vegas goes (which is generally unimpressive), this place is fairly good, but compared to restaurants in other cities, the food I had was just ok."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for a lighter lunch. They had a few different food options here and both we decided on the make your own salad. You can choose between 3-4 different green mixes, get 5 additional toppings, salad dressing, and even another free selection (like nuts) to add to your salad. You have the option to add protein for an additional charge.   The employee who put my salad together was super friendly and helpful. I would definitely grab another salad here in the future.  After you are done grabbing whatever food, you just pay at the end like cafeteria style and grab a seat in a food court area. It is great to appease everyone's palate."}
{"text":"***for Noodle Bar!***  Monique was awesome! Really helped to cater to our vegetarian needs! She had such an upbeat & bubbly attitude.   Loved this place. Will def come back here next time I'm in Vegas.   Ask for Monique!"}
{"text":"They have the best Reuben sandwich I've EVER ate in my life!! Always go there when I visit Vegas"}
{"text":"***BEWARE*** I have never had this happen before in all the restaurants and bars I have been in until coming here. I stopped by on 12/10/2016 @ 1:18 pm (server was Patrick) to buy 1 Michelob Ultra which was $7.00 and I tipped $1.00 on receipt. I always keep ALL receipts for anything and always write down on my receipt what I tip and the total. When I was doing expenses at end of month I saw that I was charged $15.00 for this transaction. Not sure how this could have been a mistake with these numbers but in any event it happened. I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else and whoever had to do with this has been caught and dealt with appropriately. This is an UNACCEPTABLE business practice."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have breakfast that didn't have an hour wait. Found this one near the monorail stop in Harrah's. Reason it was not crowded was because the food is bland and overpriced. We were seated immediately but the server did not come to take our order for 20 minutes. On the table next to us were 2 half eaten meals which were not cleared away until we were halfway through eating. The waitress finally came to take our order just as we were about to leave. She was very rude and abrupt with us and acted annoyed when we asked for clarification on the daily specials. I ended up ordering the specialty french toast with pecans which took another 15-20 minutes to arrive and was slightly warm and tasteless. The hot chocolate tasted like it came from a package. When we were done with our food I had to flag down another employee to ask for containers for our leftover and the check.I took another 15 minutes for the waitress to return with the bill.  We ended up at the restaurant for almost 1 1/2 hours. The service is terrible and the food mediocre. Never coming back here."}
{"text":"Shockingly good ramen & pad Thai! Pretty nice setting too, just inside the casino. Danny was an excellent server as well. I was a little surprised they didn't have lime for the pad Thai though, but it was still pretty tasty regardless. A Chinese beer with the meal was also a perfect combination. If you're craving some legit noodles, I highly recommend this place for a quick fix!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late at 10:30 p.m. for a quick dinner at the Noodle and Sushi Restauant. It was about $13-15 for a bowl of ramen. Dinner definitely hit the spot. Service was quick and attentive and the place was reasonably quiet for being located in the casino."}
{"text":"Located inside Harrah's, this is just a cafeteria with different food options. Knowing that, don't expect the food here to be stellar. It's simply a quick, easy option if you're passing through. There are stations for ramen, sushi, sandwiches, salads, pizza, and a bakery that serves coffee. Also, they are not open 24/7! Late at night, the food stations shut down, and the only thing that was open was the bakery. $1 off food with Total Rewards card."}
{"text":"Breakfast at 11am constituted of 5 minute wait to be seated, 10 more minutes to get coffee, another 5 minutes to get the menu.  We're already at 20minutes before ordering!  Then there is yet another 7 minutes to get order.  15 more minutes to get the food.  She forgets to drop off an item that's part of my order so I have to wait another 3 minutes to rectify that.  Of course they also mess up the order so they redo portion of the order.  That's another 7 minutes wait while my food gets cold.  So all in all, 52 minutes to get COLD eggs sunny side up, sausage, and potatoes.  They have a serious operational issue if they take this long during non rush hours.  Oh and bonus tip - the same people cleaning up the dirty dishes also serve food/coffee.  On the upside you can get free ketchup preloaded from someone else's left over when you get your food.  I suppose the food safety inspector in vegas is asleep at the wheel."}
{"text":"The salad bar here is by far my favorite in town, fresh and various, big portion and reasonable price. The pizza is good. The Asian noodles section is actually the previous Ming's Table team, authentic HK food, the XO seafood undon is awesome and beef noodles with tender is pretty popular, too. The sandwich bar has the very cool Caprese sandwich! And last but not the least, must try the cold caramel macchiato here, way better Starbucks."}
{"text":"I really enjoy visiting the Fulton Street Food Hall as it is a nice little gem. You really can get it all and is very convenient quality food that you can get fast and dine in to enjoy or grab and go. I come here late nights to satisfy my sweet tooth as their bakery is really good!  I am hooked on their black and white cake cookies. They are a white moist vanilla cake covered in white and milk chocolate in the shape of a jumbo cookie and they are ridiculous moist and good. I have made many of trips here just to pick up one of them as they are that good!  Everything is good that I have tried and the staff is very cool as well and the place is immaculate clean. They have almost every condiment you could want including packets of Cholula hot sauce for on the go!   I am a Fan!"}
{"text":"What a great concept and very well executed.  We stayed at Harrah's this trip and discovered this great food hall!  We did the \"Build your salad\" section.  Our builder, Sue, was so sweet, happy and helpful.  Full of great conversation, as she created our late night salads.  Honestly, what's nicer than someone so full of happiness while taking care of us?  Salads were freshly made with ingredients we chose and tossed by Sue.  Pricey, but it's Vegas, so that's expected. $8 each salad. $9 without a Total Rewards card.  Very delicious!  We took them up to our room and enjoyed!  There is also a pizza section, desert section, frozen yogurt section, freshly made sandwiches and coffee shop.  The entire Food Hall is bright and clean and seemed to always have quite a bit of business.  Eat there or take out.  Such a friendly atmosphere and very friendly staff to assist you."}
{"text":"2017 Yelp 100 Challenge 48/100  *** Review for the Sushi & Japanese Ramen joint ***  Service was a bit slow. The sushi guy behind the counter was mean. Customer has to remind/ask for EVERYTHING.  I don't want to give this place a bad review but goodness you are in Vegas! We had 7 girls and was hungry (for lunch). We each ordered our entree and yes! the fried rice here is good but dang it WHY SO SALTY on the Ramen?!?! I literally had to drink water rest of the day!  On a note, we were suppose to get \"spicy hot sauce\" NOT sriracha (the waiter totally forgot about our sauce)  Also, the rolls were cold (even the tempora rolls) and tasted stale. Maybe it was opened from the packaged prep and just placed on out plates??"}
{"text":"There is nothing open but this place... and even at the time only thing that was serving was over price pizza ($7 slice) and over price (warm) soda... I know things are over price but thing that makes you upset is, that they recook the cooked pizza and warm it up half way and serve it to you... I didn't have time or energy to go back down... the service was mediocre but I also didnt expect 5 star treatment... but come on..."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely terrible. We waited at the front of the line for a good 30 minutes. Finally sitting our server didn't come for another 15 minutes. Marcie our server, gave way to much attitude! When I asked her about something on the menu she tried to make me feel stupid by saying it wasn't there but it was in huge letters clearly on there. Our food took another 45 minutes. I wouldn't tell anyone to go here. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Harrah's hotel for a night and wondered around looking for food and stumbled upon this new dining place they built. It is nice because there are food options for the whole night which range from pizza to sandwiches to salads to ice cream. I was in the mood for a salad. I was very impressed with the salad bar. They let you choose the type of lettuce, about 8 different toppings, and a protein and all the fixings. Salad was huge and was like $12 which was totally worth it. So much so that I came and got it again two more times during my week stay in Vegas. Not only was it convenient, but it was also probably the healthiest thing around to eat and also the best option for a vegetarian friend I had visiting me while in Vegas. I will definitely be coming back here next year!!"}
