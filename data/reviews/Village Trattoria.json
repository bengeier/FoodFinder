{"text":"We eat there regularly and the food, service and atmosphere is always excellent. The staff are very helpful and friendly and they serve the best sea bass in the city"}
{"text":"Had dinner there with my Mom who is 89 and Italian background.  It's just OK.  Pasta was mush and veal parmigiana was so-so."}
{"text":"If you're looking for excellent Italian food in the Village of Islington, this is the place to come. The veal piccatta is amazing and wine list is quite good as well.  In the summer they open their street level front patio, which is a great place to enjoy a nice lunch or dinner with a glass of wine while people watching."}
{"text":"Very good Italian spot with friendly staffs. The islington and dundas area is filled with solid restaurants but not enough people in the area eating out it seems. I think this restaurant if opened elsewhere would be way more popular.  I always come here for lunch and always get the Trattoria Zuppa di Pesce for $12. A selection of fresh fish, mussels, shrimps, calamari in a Pernod spiced tomato broth. They are really generous with the seafood as every bite is full of seafood. I like that a lot about this dish. I've been searching for something like this since my experience at a hotel restaurant in San Diego.   I have also tried the 3 course lunch prix menu for $17 which was delicious as well comes with the ice cream.   Great spot, good friendly staffs and good food. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Decent food for a decent price. Casual atmosphere, good service.   If you are looking for a weekend lunch spot, this is where I would go. A couple of appetizers and a couple more wine glasses, and you've got yourself a fairly priced weekend lunch outing."}
{"text":"Came here with a group after looking for something unique, reasonably priced and close to Islington station (this place is a $7 cab ride or 5-10 minute walk). Happy to say the experience was a good one and everyone in the group had good things to say.  Mains with pasta, risotto, and items deemed as entrees are all in the $13-$20 range for the most part with a few items closer to $25. You get your choice of pasta or seasonal vegetables and roasted potatoes with the entrees.   Service was friendly, food was good and the place was pretty quiet so our group felt right at home and not fighting for attention. Worth visiting, but advanced notice for beer drinkers: bottle only, no draught taps."}
{"text":"A very solid four stars. Service is very friendly. Started out with grilled calamari that came with arugula, cherry tomatoes, garlic cloves and capers - very tasty! Would have it again. Then moved on to a seafood risotto - shrimp, mussels and scallops. Recommend asking for a lemon wedge to bring out all the flavour of the dish. Otherwise very tasty - rice was al dente, and the scallops were pan seared. Overall very pleased with the dinner."}
{"text":"I discovered this little Italian restaurant unexpectedly as my usual place was busy last night. There was a couple of large sized groups when we arrived but was still a very quiet night.  The caesar salad is big enough to share, perhaps even a little too big for an appetizer. You don't leave hungry that's for sure!  We ordered the veal parmigiana, and you can have it with any side, very easy going place. The penne was very nice, smooth tomato sauce but the veggies were lacking.. Maybe they were sitting around or overcooked?  The veal was huge! Like I said, you don't leave hungry. It fell apart easily, and was nice and cheesy!   Also, they bring garlic bread to the table which is a nice touch.  The sever was nice and friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"So RUDE!!! Lol I called this place to know their opening hours, this old man with a strong accent over the phone was like - \"It is SATURDAY\" and just hung up without saying anything, called back again to check if I was mistaken but nope, same old dude, I asked what times they are open and he's like \"AGAINNN???\" I mean come on, your website has no info on weekend hours and you get calls you get annoyed and just be rude over the phone with customers??? Wow. Never gonna think about stepping in your restaurant where you can't even be nice over the phone."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a couple of friends on a Thursday night and we were all very impressed with the ambience and the service. It's such a cute, quaint little restaurant that would be perfect for date night as well. Again, the service was second-to-none; very sweet, friendly and attentive. They also had smooth jazz and a lot of Sade playing in the background.   At the suggestion of the server, I ordered the Linguini Al Olio (shrimps, scallops, asparagus, roasted red peppers and garlic in extra virgin olive oil). The seafood was fresh and perfectly seasoned and the pasta was cooked el dente; however, I found the dish a bit dry. I did enjoy it though but would likely try something else on my next visit. One of my friends ordered the Potato Gnocchi (with bacon, green onion in a rose sauce) which looked and apparently tasted amazing. She said she would go for it again.  Again, beautiful spot in a beautiful neighbourhood. Hope I have the opportunity to return soon.  P.S. sorry no pics of the food but I forgot my battery was dead on my iPhone."}
{"text":"The village spot for Italian food, this is a cozy environment. It's not Buca but it's authentic.The lunch special is the best value for eating real good food. Salad and fish plus dessert for under $20 is amazing."}
