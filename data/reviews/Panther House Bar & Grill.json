{"text":"In the shadow of the cathedral of learning and within the historical echo of Tony Dorsett's Heisman streak lies the Panther House.  The owner is knowledgeable, business savvy and surprisingly handsome.  The sister property of the Campus Deli is known for its Tacos and signature cocktail; the Nittany Lion, with its mysterious contents, the taste of several National Championships are apparent.  With a health score of 101%, my only suggestion would be that the company logo include an anatomically correct panther.  When in town, make it a point to visit this staple establishment."}
