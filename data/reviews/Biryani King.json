{"text":"Best biryani in town for the price. Large serving which two can share if not too hungry. Use to be in the busy part of the plaza but with Indian consulate office now gone, much easier to access.  The kitchen was noisy like another yelper stated. I couldn't tell if they were arguing or just accustomed to making people in the front uncomfortable"}
{"text":"Ordered boneless chicken briyani. Omg so bland! And the Rita was bad as in spoiled with mold growing on top!  Never going back."}
{"text":"If you happen to be in the mecca of South Asian food aka Brampton, hop on over to Biryani King for biryani that will blow your goddamn mind.   Yes, I agree that is a heavy statement but when you hold this 3 pound brimming-to-the-edge styrofoam container of royal biryani in your hands, you will know what I mean.  Along with biryani, they serve a short menu of run of the mill karahis' and curries.  The seekh kababs are worth a try and this place might be the ONLY pakistani restaurant that has the triangle samosas with keema in it.   While waiting for your biryani, your eyes will constantly dart towards the display of kheer (pakistani rice pudding).  Give in to your inner voice and buy at least two (one is not enough trust me)  WOA: Biryani King is takeout only. It's better to roll down your windows on the way home."}
{"text":"Great biryani for the price. We also used them to cater for a birthday party (lamb biryani)- everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"i placed a phone order for EXTRA SPICY biryani i got there and paid AFTER CONFIRMING with the cashier its EXTRA SPICY when they brought me the food i CONFIRED AGAIN if its extra spicy receipt says EXTRA SPICY   I get home and i find it to be BLAND no spice at all (mostly PLAIN WHITE RICE) its like they went out of their way to make sure my request was not fulfilled (as if i was making an outrageous request)  take my money and give me crap i did not buy."}
{"text":"I have to say, their beef samosas are the best I've ever tasted. My kids love them so much they have me drive over 30 kms from my home just to have them. Their hot table looks awesome as well. The food is fresh as there always seems to be a line up to buy it."}
{"text":"Wow!  Portions are unreal...  10 bux got me a heaping mound of baryani and 3 of the best samosas ever...  nice and spicy, delicious and the chicken is amazing.  If you are on a budget, one order of baryani could fill up 2 people no problem.  No doubt the best value for money i have ever seen in all food categories.  Yummy x 1 million!"}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered one main dish from here, but their lamb karahi is just incredibly good.  The naan to go with it is also very good, as are the fish pakoras.  This place isn't fancy and although there is room for a few tables, two chairs is all they have.  The service isn't bad, but there's no small talk.  You order, you pay, you wait for your food.  I didn't expect much the first time I went in, and I'd wager that not everything on the menu is as good, but I'll keep coming back whenever I've got the craving, as long as the quality of my one dish keeps up."}
{"text":"I ordered a lamb biryani and was awful. It was extremely salty that no other flavors can come through. For a place to be named \"biryani king\" -- one would assume that they serve decent biryani -- no. not at all. far from it. And for a place to offer only takeout they forgot to put cutlery or napkins in my order."}
{"text":"Well its a take out or catering place so don't go in thinking to sit down as there are no seats. Before I get down to food lets talk about other stuff.  My order - catering for 35 people!  Service level - restaurants like this I am not expecting much as its a take out joint. But the lady did verify the order.  Restaurant - the restaurant looked clean.  Parking - not a problem as its part of a plaza.   The food isn't the top notch but some dishes are better than others and the pricing is a little easy on the pocket compared to other desi (South Asian) restaurants.  Veal Biryani (rice with veal meat) - 4/5 Alo Palak (spinach with potatoes) - 3/5 Tandori chicken pieces - 2.5/5  Chicken korma - 3.5/5 Bagara baingan (Eggplant masala curry) - 2.5/5 Gajar halwa (desert) - 4.5/5  Kheer (South Asian rice pudding) - 4.5/5   you also get rita, green salad, Pita naan. This place also serves halal meat!"}
{"text":"This take-out only gem is just giving food away. Well not giving it away for free but you pay next to nothing in comparison to other Pakistani/Indian joints. They are operating on India prices (I haven't been to Pakistan but I am quite certain it is similar price points). The average dish here costs $5 and some of the flavours and quality of food is definitely worth more.  Chicken Biryani - moist, flavourful and the take-out container is so full I have no idea how they even close it. Many restaurants will charge you $10+ for biryani and it won't be this tasty. They also have veal, lamb and shrimp biryani among others.  Keema Samosa - luckily they came out fresh when we arrived to pick up our order and we took 9! Moist, delicious and well packed samosas. Beautiful mince beef, thin and crispy pastry, deep fried, a must.   Butter Chicken - extremely sweet, honey sweet. Tasted like a dessert. Would never order again but some may like it.. only $5!  Lamb Karahi - delicious flavour but extremely oily. Still, would order again.   Nihari - The layer of oil on top was maybe an inch thick, would never order again. Probably the worst nihari I have had, but not a fair statement cause I've had mostly outstanding nihari's.  Chicken boti - a special for the day and although salty, super tender and tasty. Nice char marks from the tandoor.  Seekh Kebab - Nothing special to me. Lahore Tikka House has completely spoiled me when it comes to kebabs. These are crumbly and not how I like my kebabs. I prefer them smaller and cooked through better. I prefer tender chewy, not tender crumbly.   Dal - yellow lentil, on the thick side, well seasoned, would order again.  Channa Masala - I prefer darker curry bases and this was much lighter, maybe because many of the chick peas broke up. Very tender and seasoned well.  Naan - I've had much better but this does the trick. A little much on the thick/chewy/stretchy side but still a decent naan at the end of the day.  As I mentioned at the beginning, this is some of the best Pakistani/Indian cuisine you can get for the price, I can't believe how cheap it is. You can get a decent menu online if you google for it but when you go into the storefront the menu is much bigger. Another plus is they wrap the styrofoam containers with curries in saran wrap.  If you are on a budget or not, it is worth trying."}
{"text":"They are good but can be better in taste. Consistency matters, and this is where most of desi restaurants fail. Biryani is nice, and seekh kababs were OK. The intensity of taste in qorma and karahi, isn't there. The taste felt similar. Will suggest them to focus on a few items, and make them best."}
{"text":"Take out place, no sitting. Tried to call in advance but without response. When we got there, their excuses was because they were busy and was unable to answer calls. We ordered a chicken Bryani and an order of fish. Only 2 customers before me but still had to wait over 15 mins. Apparently they were making a fresh batch of Bryani which we got lots of rice, with 3 pieces of chicken. Pre-made fish was cold when we opened it in the car... If you don't mind waiting standing up, worth the wait.  Will try their other location next time."}
{"text":"Was home for a visit and craving some biryani so I swung by this spot one afternoon.  Straight off, the service isn't awesome.  I mean I stood there for at least five minutes before I was acknowledged. On the other hand, it was some of the best biryani I've ever had.  Nice and spicy, and there was A LOT of food in the to-go box.  The food on display, kebabs and such, looked so good, I had to talk myself out of getting one of everything.  Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"The biryani was below average. Believe me I would know I'm from India and I know when there is good biryani. The last at the front was a bit distant if not rude. I order biryani, samosa aloo palak and naan.   The potato is aloo palak was raw, literally. Samosa was made of phyllo dough. For good sake phyllo dough used for a samosa in a Pakistani restaurant??   I usually don't leave bad reviews but I would not go back."}
{"text":"Ordered Shami Kabab, daal/mixed lentils and a boneless chicken biryani   Was told it would take 10 mins so I told the lady that we would like to have the shami kabab while we waited. Totally ignored my request and I let it go because there were people after me standing in line.   Shami kabab was a little on the spicy side for me.   The boneless chicken biryani they got wrong, so check your order before leaving the store. Called the store to complain and guy that answered doesn't understand English. Lady that he put on said they would make good on next visit but wouldn't give her name.   Biryani tasted better than the one I've eaten from Silver Spoons.  Large portion of mainly rice.   We were too full after the Shami kabab and the large portion of chicken biryani, we put the lentils away for tomorrow's dinner and we still have leftover rice."}
{"text":"The beef Samosas are good. But the staff is rude. They constantly mess your orders and refuse to change them, blaming you, on top of that wait times are ridiculous. The lady working the cash has no idea what she is doing."}
{"text":"I got Biryani king to cater for a party I had. So I'll explain what happened below.   My little brother once farted next to me it was a smelly and unpleasant experience. This experience oddly resurfaced when I took my first bite of biryani from Biryani king.  I'm not saying their food taste like farts, but it is what I experienced after my first bite.   Was their food good ?   Courtney Cox played a chef in Friends and Biryani Kings food was worst than her acting!!!!!   Also the amount of leftovers and unhappy guest at my party told me that  \" Biryani kings rice wasn't cooping with their stomachs\".   In sum, I wouldn't recommend  Biryani kings catering for big events or parties."}
{"text":"A good take out place by the passport office. No fuss at all, just basics. There is one cashier behind the counter and the menu on the wall.   Got the order within 5 minutes and it was nice and hot.  Samosas are a little bit more than competitive pricing $2.50 for 3 but they were great. I could actually taste the morsels of meat and it had a slight kick of spice,  but wouldn't kill my non spicy eating friends. The dough on the outside was also thin,  so the meat to carb ratio was good. Chicken Biryani with bone was under $5. She accidentally rung up the boneless one for $2 more, but after I insisted I really am ok with the bone in one (I like the fatty pieces of chicken) she changed the order back. Huge take out box filled to the brim with rice with 2 big pieces of chicken and a nice chutney. Good spice again!   If I'm in the area I'd definitely swing by for another cheap lunch!    They also have a few curries I'd like to try!"}
{"text":"Place is clean, food was good and priced right. What more could you ask for? I have been here several times, and if there is one thing people should remember when going to a desi restaurant, is that you should have low expectations about service. You will help better luck! Enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"I love the boneless chicken briyani. But they never have it in stock and I'm not a huge fan of the chicken biryani  Don't forget to order the yogurt"}
{"text":"They got the name right for this one! This has to be the best biryani I have ever had. This is a takeout only joint. Their regular biryani, with a chicken leg and a thigh piece, comes in a styrofoam box filled to the brim (and I am not joking about this...it is completely packed!). Also, it is freaking cheap..just $5 without taxes. They have two spice levels: spicy and mild. I always get the mild since the spicy has too many chillies...and yes it is Indian spicy! I have tried out their other offerings...the sheesh kebab is just OK, the fish is meh. I wouldn't really spend my money on those. The lamb biryani is delicious too. The service at this place is a bit hit or miss. Sometimes the lady at the counter is in a good mood but sometimes she is just rude and impatient. It is worth the drive to Brampton just to eat the biryani though!"}
{"text":"The price you pay for the biryani you get is a steal. The portions usually come with a good amount of meat. The wait is usually never long. The selection of dishes is not great but the prices make up for that. They run out of a lot of the food which can be frustrating as only half the already condensed menu is available. The quality of food is average but you wont be hungry after. Great for a quick dinner idea. One night i was served chicken that was in fact a little raw."}
{"text":"This is probably the third or fourth time Yelp has let me down when it comes to picking a new place to eat. I went here during a relatively slow time and I probably wasted 30 minutes to receive my substandard meal. Regardless of that the service is absolutely horrible (but expected); the servers have no idea what they are doing and know nothing about the food they serve. I wouldn't recommend visiting this place as it'll be a waste of your time."}
{"text":"I love biryani, more like obsessed with it. i can eat it every meal every day. I love their biryani, goat biryani is my favorite. Rice is cooked to perfection in my opinion. And the portion is huge. $6.99for that is great. But also because of the portion and price, there won't be a lot of meat. Sometimes it's spicy but I love spicy food, it's not an issue. Didn't try much other food because Evey time my eyes were on the biryani. Definitely need to try if you like rice."}
{"text":"Came in twice. I asked them many times to make sure it's not spicy. Guess what it was extra spicy. Not sure if they understand English."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! I'm not sure if I had the same biryani that the people are raving about.  There wasn't enough meat in the lamb and boneless chicken biryani.  It was like digging for gold in the Klondikes. The taste of the biryani wasn't even close to the best I've had.  I'm from out of town and went to this location strictly based on the reviews left by customers.  I just don't know if I went on a bad day or if the people leaving good reviews just don't know what good food tastes like.  I'm guessing I just went on a bad day.  This was a one time try and I wouldn't go back again.  I wouldn't really recommend this place for biryani.  I didn't try anything else from there so I can't comment on that.  I hope this helps others who are looking to try this place strictly based on reviews on yelp."}
{"text":"Slightly less than 3* 'cause I waited like 10-15mins for a regular Chicken Biryani.  Don't they just scoop rice and plop a coupla pieces of chicken in a styro container??  Note:  Take-out ONLY!  Adjacent to Rona, this place is literally a counter, with some snacks, and a cash register on it.  With the exception of a coupla benches & chairs, there is no seating whatsoever.  Yes, prices are cheap.  A regular, i.e. \"with bone\", Chicken Biryani was $5.50, including tax.  Boneless/lamb/shrimp was more expensive, $6.99, before taxes.  Biryani was one of the better ones that I've had, even raita was good.  However, service is sloooow.  I stood in front of the cash for a few minutes before my order was taken.  (There was a girl grabbing some snacks out of the showcase, but she never acknowledged me.)  Actually getting the biryani was even slower.  Amongst the noisy workers in the back, I thought I heard one worker exclaim, \"There wasn't fresh rice!!\", so I'm assuming that they had to cook more.  Lady who took my order never said anything to me about the food coming soon.    If I was in the area, very unlikely that I'd be deep in Brampton, and I was craving biryani, I wouldn't rule this out.  Having said that, I wouldn't drive out of my way either!"}
{"text":"Note:  Just like their Brampton location, this is TAKEOUT only.  There is no tables set up.  I was really excited when I saw that a Biryani King opened up near me.  Not that I had such a wonderful experience at their other location - read my review - but because biryani is a quick go-to meal for me, plus it's relatively inexpensive.  Anyway, I finally had the opportunity to drop by today for a takeout at their new Mississauga location.  The set-up is basically the same as Brampton, but there were NO patrons other inside.  Admittedly, it was a weird time, ~3pm.  There was no one at the counter and no bell to ring for service which I thought was a bit odd.  How are they supposed to know that someone is waiting for be served?  After a couple minutes, a man finally came out from the saloon doors.  He appeared very downtrodden and stressed.  Even when I tried to small-talk with him, asking him when they opened (Oct. 11th), his demeanor was still sullen.  Not a happy person.  I guess the \"Help Wanted\" sign in the window was a bit of a tip off!  Food:  A Chicken Biryani takeout was $5.50, after taxes, pretty cheap for the amount of food.  It came with maybe 3 pieces of chicken (a bit overcooked), rice was more yellow in colour, and there was a blob of the spice mixture at the bottom of the styro.  So it was not mixed properly.  It was a bit spicy.  Raita was a minty green colour.  Not the best biryani that I have had, but certainly not the worst either.  If the man who served me was a bit friendlier/welcoming, I may come back if I was in a food bind.  However, his demeanor does not make me wanna go back...running.  Oh well, my search for the best Chicken Biryani, under $10, continues..."}
{"text":"This place is often a hit or miss, in fact, the only reason I come here is because of the close proximity to my house (I have probably been here at least 50 times). I actually think that Biryani King has potential to be a great place, however the customer service is SOMETIMES poor - having to wait a few minutes for someone to take my order; some dude talking to his friend on the phone and telling me to hold on a moment.   Now, if you don't care much about customer service you may actually like this place!  - The boneless chicken biryani is actually very good (4/5) albeit quite pricey - they do have a regular biryani as well but I never liked it - Their Chicken Kabab roll is AWESOME (4.5/5) - Their Behari Chicken is pretty decent (3.5/5) - I think they actually decreased the size of their naans this year, but they are just like any other restaurant's - This may come as harsh but I have tried many of the curries (Haleem, Butter Chicken, Chicken Karahi) and have NEVER had a positive experience with ANY of them  To conclude, a select few items are good, but this place is more pricey than other restaurants within its league."}
{"text":"So I always eat there with my family we always spend 50 more well today we went there again we eat there at least once a week  My husband and son walk in make a order while waiting they saw cockroaches crawling around we have reported this problem to peel inspection I am so disappointed! Now I don't know where to get good biryani when I called peel inspection these guys are already listed aswell sucks !!! You guys should shut down"}
{"text":"Writing this review with great sadness...I've been a loyal \"Biryani King\" patron for about two years where I've suffered through very poor customer service, inconsistency in flavors (sometimes bland, sometimes too spicy),  and why?  Cause I love their biryani!  Unfortunately, tonight is the last straw when I found a nice toasted roach in my box of boneless chicken biryani....  Prices are still decent and but I can't stomach the tag along \"bonus\" crunch.  Sorry Briyani King, we've had many good times."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and I went to this place for vegetarian biryani yesterday. I had called them in advance to confirm if they make veg biryani and they confirmed to me that they indeed make veg biryani separately than other biryanis. And when I was picking it up I asked again to confirm about it being vegetarian. But when I came home and transferred it on my plate I saw a big piece of chicken in it. I have no more words to describe what I felt...my recommendation- avoid this place like plague."}
{"text":"So people normally complain about how much they spend versus how much they get. Biryani king is very affordable and very filling! They have a variety between chicken, boneless chicken, lamb (i think goal and veal as well?). They also have other dishes like butter chicken and kebabs.   The biryani experience is kind of a hit and miss. At times the rice to meat proportion is more but otherwise there is a well balance between protein to carb ratio. By default it is spicy.  It is an order and pickup service, not an establishment where you dine in. there is also a bit of waiting involved at times after you order.  Service is also a hit and miss as well. At times the service is great but at other times your orders could come out wrong and you'd need to spend like a few minutes explaining to them but i haven't had an experience where they were full out rude.  It is a decent take out place. You get a filling amount for what you pay for and I'm satisfied most of the time. If you are in the mood for biryani and don't want to spend $$$ and want to be filled, i'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered goat biryani and chicken biryani both very spicy. Take out quantity was good but the chicken/goat qty was less. Also, spice was missing in biryani. It was mild biryani.. I would prefer it when I don't want to eat spicy."}
{"text":"I have never had samosas like the ones here.  They are full of spiced meat with just a touch of chilli pepper. The dude at the cash is nice and will serve you up what you want... Never had the biryani but I hear it's good and the prices are good.... Take away only."}
{"text":"I placed a relatively simple take-out order: 2 Chicken Tikka Masala 2 Butter Chicken 2 Tandoori Chicken 2 Fish (yes, it's just called \"Fish\") 1 Naan, 4 pieces  When I got home I discovered that I received: a) 2 Chicken Tikka Masala/Butter Chicken (they look exactly the same) b) 1 Mystery dish (had pieces of chicken and vegetables, no sauce) c) 2 Tandoori Chicken, STILL RAW on the inside. d) 2 Fish e) .75 Naan, 2 fresh pieces, 1 already cut piece  A few things: a) They should post either photos or descriptions next to their menu items to educate their customers. I was thoroughly confused as whether I received 2 Tikka Masala's or 2 Butter chickens. b) If someone could explain this to me, I would be very grateful. Are there different versions of Tikka Masala or Butter Chicken that do not contain sauce? c) UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN IS INEXCUSABLE. d) Fish is tasty but not fried fresh. Actually, nothing here is made-to-order. Everything is pre-made and just dished out. e) I was told that a single order of naan had 4 pieces. I was given 3 and one was not fresh, very disappointed, don't give me old food. I'm paying just as much money as the next person. - They should have an order tracking system. They have absolutely no way of matching an order to a customer. If all they do is take-out, you better make sure that the correct customer is leaving with the correct order. I very well may have been given an order that did not belong to me.  Based on a previous experience where I ordered Shrimp Biryani and Lamb Biryani each of which had less than an ounce of Shrimp or Lamb in it I will not be returning. I will be seeking out other establishments or be making my own to get my Indian food fix."}
{"text":"A great Pakistani restaurant locally. Really good biryani, a bit spicy for me, but still enjoy it. They have good kabobs, and karhai's.   Always packed with people catering food, or just picking up a single serving of biryani."}
{"text":"If you have even the slightest idea of how good biryani should taste like, you wouldn't miss out on this little gem. Be assured that your taste buds will thank you after you have finished the meal while the pleasure center in your brain will be wildly wagging his tail like a mad dog. I'm serious. Good food as it should be, no fuss. Handover the 5 bucks, take your box, say thank you, leave the place and you tell me what happened next.  Awesome job guys, keep up the good work. You guys are a slap in the face to all those overated and expensive places selling biryani that tastes like crap."}
{"text":"Garbage tasting food. People only like it because they are broke and get a lot, i mean a lot of bland artificially colored rice with very little meat."}
