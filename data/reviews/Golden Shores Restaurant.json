{"text":"Im a huge fan of Jamaican food and sometimes I go on quite the mission to get good quality and great tasting Jamaican food.  Well been living in my new area now for about 7 months now and I just recently caught Golden Shores at the corner of my as I was driving.  Here is the best part.  Its 5 mins away from where I live.  This was a great find and I soon as I found the opportunity I stopped in to grab some food.  A little disappointed they don't have jerk pork but that's ok because a lot of places don't.  I ordered a small jerk chicken dinner and a small ox tail diner because I was confused which I wanted to eat so I got both.  The jerk was very tasty and full of flavor.  Oh and very spicy just the way I like it.  The ox tail was to die for.  The ox tail gravy was sweet yet savory as it should be.  The gentleman working behind the counter was very friendly and easy to talk to.  Quick service and very clean if you decide to use the few tables they have.  Golden Shores you will be seeing a lot of me."}
{"text":"Oh wow! I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet. I only found this place by accident, but wow, was it awesome!!
This is a very small place with limited seating available. 

I've tried their white meat jerk chicken with rice lunch deal ($11!!) and the portion size and the very flavorful treat has me wanting to come back for more."}
{"text":"Rice and jerk chicken seemed pretty dry, portion for the large is good. Taste was really good but a bit spicy for myself. Need to try other items on their menu. Customer service was good."}
