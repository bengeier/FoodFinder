{"text":"Lived in the area for 12 years. been here around 2006 got a slice it was good. Today i wanted something from a local since i always go to local places now for my food. And let me tell you this place makes a great pizza. The chicken ways are very good too i was shocked the best wings i ever had in my life. The pizza is also great but the wings caught me by surprise they are really good. The prices are very good as well. Don't waste your money on chains this is a great local place!"}
{"text":"I seriously hope I don't offend the loyal patrons of Enrico's Pizza with the following observation's but here they are. I was once awed by the remarkable creations that sprung forth from this magical Kingston Rd. kitchen, but sadly ten years later the pizza at Enrico's ceases to amaze or even satisfy a churning stomach. 

Scenario: I had been bogged down at work all day and neglected to tend to the most base of human needs, eating. I hadn't ingested anything since 9:00am because I simply hadn't had the chance. I drove directly from work to a Softball game at Blantyre Park. we realized that we we were playing an hour later than we had originally thought and I decided that I would try Enrico's being that it was in the relative proximity.  I took orders and was on my way. 

I will save a lengthy diatribe about the utter lack of quality that I subjected my empty stomach to. But will say this, I seriously considered giving my second slice away and was seconds away from doing just that before a friend jumped in and offered me a trade, his slice for mine. Now I will say that his was better, but it still lacked the quality of the Enrico's of my childhood and now I only have past memories of the glory that Enrico's once held"}
{"text":"Was on my way home and was hungry! Saw Enricos haven't been here since I went to High School at BPCI! I should have kept driving. I walked in and it's like it hasn't been cleaned since 1997? I asked if thy had slices? Guy and girl both said yes and he asked if I wanted cheese? I asked what else you got? He said Pepperoni? I said sure! He pulled out the cheese slice and the lady placed some pepperoni on the cheese slice? At this point I was about to walk out. But felt bad so I paid and left with my so called \"Pepperoni slice\" I was gonna eat it in my car but once I folded it on the was I saw Greese/ Oil at the fold in the plate! I ate it standing outside my car! After the 1st bite I thought I should have just tossed $4 out my window as I drove! Never again!"}
