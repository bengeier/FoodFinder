{"text":"Awesome place! A bakery on one side, BBQ on the other...two great places packed into one location! 

My wife and I split a BBQ platter and it was more than enough to fill up and save room for a couple scoops of ice cream after! The chopped BBQ is pork and cooked over hickory daily. It was tender and delicious. It came dry (without sauce for you non-BBQ aficionados) but it was so moist! They offer two choices of sauce, both vinegar based; one sweeter and one worth more of a kick. 

We will definitely return when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Great stuff! I had the shrimp po'boy. Shrimp was cooked perfect, well seasoned. Get the tartar sauce, it's wonderful. Ice cream is great, and I thought well priced at 1.30 a scoop. I highly recommend this place. I'll be trying it again."}
{"text":"Well, I usually frequent the Varsity maybe twice a week.  Well, u really need to teach the younger girls how to work. In the past month, I've left with cold food cause of the line in the drive thru wouldn't move up, I've been giving the wrong food, I've had things out of my order and I do check before I leave.  The last time was this week when things were left out of my order.  I told the lady who brought it to me cause I had to pull up.  so another lady pops her head in the window and says  I  know u got the items because I placed them in the bag.  First of all, u don't argue with the customer and I gave her the bag back. and as I said...my items were not in there..got the WRONG bag....again.... and didn't get an apology from the snotty nose curly hair girl but did get one from the nice dark hair lady.  so time to train your younger ones how do do a good job !!!"}
{"text":"Well... if the owner's intent was to trade upon the Varsity in Atlanta's fame and reputation, they failed."}
{"text":"Can't stand this place. We went in to have just dessert and the guy helping us (may have been the manager) asked us where we had dinner. When we told him he then proceeded to slam the place (really unprofessional and made us uncomfortable). We went ahead and ordered some pastries and as we were waiting we noticed Fox News on every TV in the place. Majorly turned us off again. Then looking around at the people we noticed this one old guy with a NRA hat on.....another \"ugh\". Most importantly though is our food sucked. Cookies had an artificial taste, cream horn dry and the ice cream was very \"average\"."}
{"text":"Stopped in and got the jumbo BBQ sandwich fries and mac n cheese. Everything was fantastic! The food, service, and ice cream. For dessert I got a cookies n cream shake that was amazing! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"You will love this place great food and plenty of it. The servers are very attentive,fast and friendly.They have the best burgers in town.Every thing is cooked to order and fast. The price for a 1/2 pound cheese burger lettuce,tomato,grilled onions,pickles,mayo and mustard on a 5 inch bun, fries and pickle aprx $6.25. Can't be bet or if you fancy a Bar-B-Q plate with fries,red or white slaw & 3 hushpuppies aprx $8.25 ( Looked like about 1 pound of BAR-B-Q ). And also a plus they have a drive thru for call in orders and there fast. So if your in town give it a try you will be pleased. THE FOOD DUDE.  : )"}
{"text":"First stop here and I'm so so so glad I found this place !! Sister and I had the Shrimp Plate and it was wonderful - lightly battered, cooked perfectly and very tasty. Very generous portions on the shrimp, and sides. Price is low and service was super. It does have a cake/small bakery and ice cream section that I did not use, yet.  Really happy to have this as I grew up eating quality seafood in Florida, and now that I've moved here I can find the same quality and taste. The menu is extensive and varied, so it will be a great stop for anyone wanting great food, great price and service. Thanks Fieldhouse !!"}
{"text":"Brilliant BBQ joint. And when they say ULTIMATE BLT they mean it.  Family had Ultimate BLT, BBQ Sandwhich, Deluxe Burger  and we loved it. Service was tentative and kept drinks refilled.  

It's a small BBQ Joint and as most southern BBQ places it'd a seat yoirself, so be ready to wait a few for a table to empty out. We went at lunch and waited o ly 5 minutes...

HIGHLY recommend Varsity to others!"}
{"text":"My wife and I took our granddaughter and her husband for lunch to celebrate his birthday.  It was the first time I had eaten there.  We arrived around 1200, and the dining room was crowded with happy diners.  However, a table quickly opened.  I ordered the oyster Po' Boy sandwich with fried onion rings, homemade coleslaw, and homemade tartar sauce.  My wife had the flounder sandwich.  The quality of the food was impressive.  The seafood was fresh and cooked to perfection, and the homemade coleslaw and tartar sauce were among the best I have ever eaten.
Patrons have to walk by the bakery to get to the dining area.  Although we did not partake of any baked goods, I was certainly tempted to do so.  Perhaps next time."}
{"text":"Small American restaurant but, BIG on taste and quality!!!!!   This place is amazing.... from their burgers, hot-dogs, all the way to their wings!!!!  Definitely a favorite of mine!!!!"}
{"text":"No matter how \"good\" the food is sometimes, the customer service here ruins it all. The ladies that work here are always rude every single time I visit. I've been told the same from all of my coworkers who used to (we no longer give them out business) eat there and family and friends who used to visit as well. Before long this place will be losing lots of its business if it doesn't change the staff it has to more appreciative people."}
{"text":"Love this small town staple! Great menu, sweet staff and awesome owner! 
They have good specials and one of my favs is the country style steak, mash pots and green beans! Yummmm I believe that one is Wednesday's special. 
Only complaint is that the owner is a duke fan!!! Boooo haha"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time while I was in Ktown for a wedding. Good bbq and great waitstaff. Had to force myself not to indulge in the desserts."}
{"text":"A ton of delicious food for a very cheap price. Love stopping here on my way home from work!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars, the food is great. BUT, everytime I go through the drive through the NEVER EVER put any sauce with my 5lbs of BBQ! Then I get home and have to drive back ten miles just to get the sauce then drive 10 miles back home putting me 20 miles out of my way! I also love the Oyster poboy and the last three times I got one I asked for extra tartar sauce I got home there was no tartar sauce no lettuce and no tomato just bread and oysters thus putting me 20 miles out of the way again! My recommendation is if you're going to eat there, eat inside! Do not I repeat do not go through the drive through unless you plan on parking AND taking all your big bags of food apart every time...."}
{"text":"While the ambiance begins to hint at a football game, it stops way too soon.  I mention the ambiance before the food b/c the food is that lackluster.  Plain.  Big thumbs up for small business, local business.  Just not my favorite for the food."}
{"text":"Neat little down-home type place with generous portions and friendly staff.  I'll stop in again when I'm passing through"}
{"text":"The chopped tray and red slaw were great. The Sweet Daddy's Sauce was a little sweet with the right touch of heat. Hush puppies seemed really dry didn't care for them, could have just been a bad day. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good local spot for a casual no frills meal. Good burgers and hot dogs with crinkle fries. The burgers are fresh hand made. The place could be kept much cleaner though."}
{"text":"If you're just in town visiting for the night visiting this is absolutely the place to go. The only place in Kannapolis/Concord that you can order the best meal you've had in weeks and then turn around and have an entire bakery of fresh sweets at your fingertips. The atmosphere is extremely friendly and the owners even make their way around the place to visit with all of their customers. Don't be surprised if the place is packed when you arrive because it stays busy constantly. It's a local favorite that has amazing food as well as genuine southern hospitality and I would recommend the Varsity to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a bad dinner experience here. I had heard it was \"where the locals eat\" and was excited to give it a try. The management must have had an off night (hopefully) because the staff of two pre-teen/teenage waitresses was stressed to the max and simply not able to adequately service the volume of customers that evening. It was a full house, granted, this is a very small, too-tightly packed dining space.  Chairs and tables were rickety and not just in that charming nostalgic way-- closer to causing someone to fall due to a flimsy chair. All of this I was willing to overlook until our food arrived and it was mediocre at best. Certainly not worth the price and frustration of having to ask the wait staff repeatedly for something as simple as a bottle of ketchup.  What bothered me perhaps the most was not my own poor experience, but that a table of women were left to seat themselves and procure menus on their own only to have to wait an inordinate amount of time to even have their drink order taken while it appeared that other tables of what may have been locals received what seemed to be preferential treatment.  I'm from a small NC town myself and prize local establishments like this, but I hold them to the same standard that I would for any establishment serving the public; to treat all customers with respect and hospitality. After all, as a business owner, wouldn't you want those who are new to the area and to your restaurant to choose to become regulars? 

Again, perhaps all involved were just having an off-night.  If I do try this place again, I will try going at a less busy hour and hope for a better experience."}
{"text":"Asked for sprinkles on my cone and she picked up a little spoon and sprinkled them on the top of the cone so there were only a few on it. Everyone knows that's not how it's done.  Once I went to go pay it started to make sense. Little sign that says. 15 cents extra for debit and 50 cents for credit. Also notice there are almost no lights on the ice cream side. Seems like someone it looking to save money but at the expense of the customer and the experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the world!  Great hometown decor (especially if you like high school sports). Chicken tenders and BBQ are some of the best I have ever eaten. Attached is a great bakery you can access when Varsity is open even if the bakery is closed. Prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you get. Large BBQ sandwich is almost enough for two  Come hungry and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting little business, and one that can be a challenge to navigate.

On the right, you have a bakery - which is often packed with people either picking up orders they have already placed, looking for new goodies to take out or what have you. On the left is the Bar-B-Q, and you have to weave your way past those sweet-seeking folks to get into the sit-down area (or get something to go) from there.

The service is excellent, and quite friendly from both sides, it's just a bit of a challenge is all.

However, the best item on the menu isn't the barbecue - it's good, but not great. The burgers and dogs were much tastier. Even the other food looked good, and came out quick."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fish is purchased locally and is so good! My husband always gets the Varsity Deluxe burger. You can't go wrong with anything you order. Grilled chicken salad is great, fried squash, country style steak on certain days. We go at least once a week and it's always busy. They also have cherry lemon sundrop! Ice cream and the best cakes next door as well!"}
{"text":"Country Style steak lunch special with 2 sides for $7.15 was excellent! Great service and owner was walking around greeting everyone. Attached bakery a bit pricey so we passed. Too full anyway from large portions!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Bbq & ice cream p? Best combination. Lunch is crowded but that's to be expected in a small place."}
{"text":"What a cool, multifaceted place, small BBQ/Sandwich joint on the left side, an excellent bakery on the right side. The service in the BBQ area is fast food style, order and pay at the counter, and grab a seat to wait. Time for orders out of the kitchen is pretty good.

We tried a Chopped BBQ sandwich with regular slaw, and a Hot Dog, with M,C, & O. The BBQ here is solid, but probably not the very best in the area, but definitely worth a stop. The Hot Dog was outstanding, the chili meaty & full of flavor. I would order both again, probably 2 dogs.

The bakery side is amazing - great looking pastries, huge variety, nice service. We tried the Chocolate Eclairs, Oatmeal Cookies, and excellent Pound Cake. The Chocolate Eclairs were super, as well, but the Oatmeal Cookies were a disappointment. Next time through (and there will be a next time) we'll try the Cream Horns, they looked fantastic.

Great little place, with a variety of great food options."}
{"text":"Nice little place that gives you a lot of food for the price. Everyone was so nice. I didnt get anything from the bakery but everything looked good. They had some good ice cream flavors too but I did not try any. I would like go back when they cook ribs and certain things they cook on the weekends."}
