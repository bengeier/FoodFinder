{"text":"Stopped for lunch. Very tasty food, good service and a very clean and friendly place. Only downside is no Alcohol sales. Had more than I could eat for $9.95!! Having the rest tonight. Will be back next time I am in Madison"}
{"text":"I had a 30 minute window from time of submission to pick-up. I arrived about 35 minutes later and food was ready for pick-up. It took about 5 minutes for me to get service when I arrived but there was only 1 staff worker and it was relatively busy for lunch. There was a large group of about 15 people dining and several other tables of 2-3 diners.   First of all, I'm not well versed with Cambodian Cuisine so I don't know what's authentic and what's not but the menu seems to be having an identity crisis. They have your typical Southeast Asian offerings (Pho, Curries, Larb, Sticky Rice, Banh Xeo) but then the other half of the menu looks like your typical Chinese-American menu. It was difficult to identify what was Cambodian and what wasn't (except the Chinese-American foods). I assume Cambodian cuisine is a mixture of Lao, Thai & Vietnamese foods but I still don't get the Chinese-American menu items.   I ordered the Pork Thai Larb w/sticky rice, Duck Clay Pot and another side of Stick Rice.   Pork Larb portion was rather small but since it was listed as an appetizer and only $4, I can't really complain. I wish they gave more larb because 3/4 of the container was lettuce and cucumbers. Taste - it wasn't too bad. I like my larb more sour with a stronger lemongrass flavor. This was very lightly sweet and not much lemongrass. It was also supposed to come with sticky rice but it was not in the bag :( I only received 1 order of sticky rice when I should have gotten 2.   Duck Clay Pot: mine did not look as yummy as other photos on yelp and I did not get a fried egg either. I would have preferred the baby bok choy over the broccoli as well. Again, 1/3 of the bowl was broccoli & duck and the other 2/3 was rice :( Taste - it was a tad salty. The meat kind of tasted like duck seasoning but I think it was chicken and not duck.   Overall: I'd give them another try if others want to go and I'd try dining in vs take-out."}
{"text":"Had a great meal, the Clay pot was amazing and stayed hot the entire meal, we tried the duck, it was good. The soups are quite different, we tried a sour eggplant soup with noodles, it was more like a Pho, not as flavorful. The other soup was a fish and coconut thick soup with a platter of veggies to dip in, very beautifully presented and some of the veggies were outstanding. Our 11 year old had the Pad Thai and tofu, it was great, served piping hot. The server was very nice, very attentive. Almost would give a 5 star but they just opened and had some imperfections."}
{"text":"I think Angkor Wat \"deserves\" two stars based on my experience today, but I'm rooting for them.  So I'm bumping up to a 3.  I called for lunch takeout around 12:15.  I ordered Thai Rolls (described on the Yelp-linked menu as fried egg roll) and Pad Thai.  I was told to come get it in 30-45 minutes.  That seemed like a long time for Pad Thai, so I asked if I had heard correctly.  The person taking my order said they had just opened a few minutes ago and needed time to get set up.  (OK... but your door and Yelp both say you open at 11, and I'd think you'd be well into lunchtime by 12:15?)  It wasn't a great start.  The real problem came when I went to pick up the food.  There was some confusion about where it was, but that was resolved fairly quickly.  I was initially charged the wrong price, but the server quickly apologized and corrected the bill.  She was awesome (I think she said she's the daughter of the owner), but she seemed a bit overwhelmed.  As far as I could tell, she was the only server, and I heard her apologizing to multiple tables about the wait.  Some of the diners looked bored and/or annoyed.  She also said she wasn't scheduled to work that day and had been called in last minute.  Once I got back to my office, I realized both parts of my order were wrong.  I'd wanted vegetarian Pad Thai, but I was given shrimp(?)  Almost any other protein would've been OK, but I hadn't wanted shrimp and these particular ones seemed overcooked and unpleasant.  I picked them out, but realized then I was pretty much left with noodles and mung beans.  Underwhelming.  I hadn't previously realized it was possible for something to be bland *and* spicy.  I appreciated that there were hot pepper flakes of some sort in the Pad Thai because I like spicy, but other than that there just didn't seem to be much flavor.  Not much discernible tamarind, not many peanuts (I discovered later they were on the bottom.)  In fairness, there was some fresh cilantro and that was a nice touch.  Maybe it was missing salt or something?  Hard to say.  I went for the egg rolls and realized I'd actually been given summer rolls.  I like summer rolls, but I just wasn't in the mood for them at all.  I offered them to a coworker.  She said they were OK - she liked that there was a lot of fresh basil and cilantro.  She said it just seemed like there was an ingredient or two missing, which was more-or-less exactly how I felt about the Pad Thai.  To be fair, I ordered a Thai dish and they're really a Cambodian restaurant, so for now I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and may give them another try in a few weeks.  Fingers crossed they can resolve a few of the organizational issues (more servers?  clearer hours?) they seemed to have today."}
{"text":"Like the other prior reviewers, this is a modestly inflated star rating as I really want this brand new place to get better and I'm hopeful they're just working out \"we just opened\" kinks.   The restaurant was about half full on this Saturday evening. The ambiance is nice, good lighting, lots of windows, & white tablecloths.  Our server was friendly enough but seemed to miss a few key service points (i.e., entrees for different people coming out with big time gaps between them, just dropping off the check aon the table towards the end of the meal, before we were even finished & not asking if we wanted anything else, dessert, a box for leftovers, etc).    My initial disappointment happened as I perused the menu and realized the lack of vegetarian options.  Out of perhaps 10 appetizers only two were vegetarian - sticky rice and thai spring rolls. The spring rolls were okay but seemed to be missing some flavor/veggies, heavy on the clear noodles. They also came out on one plate with a dipping sauce but we weren't given any individual appetizer plates to accompany this.  For entrees, there also weren't a lot of vegetarian options, which I think is unusual for a Thai restaurant. There were several different versions of pad thai (different noodles seemed to be the major difference) that could be ordered with tofu and then there was one curry you could order with tofu. Besides that, everything seemed to have meat in it. If you wanted to try to get a special-request veg dish made, there were \"chicken\" and \"beef\" menu headings that listed things like \"beef & mixed vegetables\". I asked our server if we could replace the meat with tofu and she seemed to think this could work but it was clear it hadn't been a consideration in menu creation.  The entrees were ordered were good (the curry) and ok (the pad thai). The curry was flavorful and was a nice portion and chock full of veggies & tofu. The pad thai was ordered spicy & came out mild and seemed to be heavy on the noodles.   All in all, it wasn't as good as I'd hoped for but I'll wait a few weeks/months and give it another shot. I just hope they work out the service kinks and recognize that they need to either add a vegetarian section to the menu or at least more options and perhaps split the menu so it's clear what is Cambodian & what is Thai."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to Angkor wat when I read they were opening up. Authentic Cambodian and Thai cuisine but alas I can't say that it is.   I stopped in for lunch and was geeked by a staff who may be the owner's daughter. I like family owned restaurant as they usually do a good job. I was shown a menu and when I couldn't find the lunch menu, I asked if they had one. Yes they do. Why didn't they show it to me, I have no idea.   Lunch was ok. I had their pad Thai to see what it is like. She asked me how spicy and I said mild. Usually I don't get that question for pad Thai, oh well. A bowl of soup cane first and it was fragrant. I can't pin point the smell but taste alright. I thought I was getting a spring roll too but that's not the case. You see, the normal lunch cones with a spring roll or soup but I wasn't asked. There's another type of lunch option called the deluxe that came with soup and spring roll. I had to ask for the menu again to confirm that. I was told the normal lunch menu cones with soup only. They are changing their lunch menu and maybe that's why I wasn't given a lunch menu prior.   The pad Thai was not as authentic.  I thought authentic pad Thai had peanuts in it but this one doesn't. The color was pale and the chili sauce is quite obvious. In fact I thought the chilli sauce used reminded me of the typical chili oil that a chinese restaurant would use.   I also overheard mandarin spoken between a lady and someone in the kitchen leading me to believe that the food is more chinese than Cambodian.   Anyway, I might go back to try other dishes once they settle down but for the near future, I would pass on."}
{"text":"Can't give an accurate food review; tried to eat here for dinner and they were closed with no explanation.  Hours posted on the door and online said they should be open (around 6:30 pm), but lights inside were off and no one was there..."}
{"text":"Look I am not going to inflate my star rating.... it was just barely OK and I will only go back in a couple months (if they are still open) because I want to see more successful restaurants open on Park St. in order to support businesses within walking distance of my home.  The thick wheat Pad Thai noodles were overcooked and mushy - I ordered it as spicy as they could make it and Marissa (who orders here food as mild as possible) could eat it without any problems....Good thing they had a bottle of Siracha on the table (of course if I wanted to add Siracha to my Pad Thai I could have made it at home and dumped it on) so I guess I am less than impressed.  I have also been eating vegetarian for the last couple months and they simply do not have the menu designed with vegetarians in mind.... :(  and to top it all off our waitress simply was not familiar with the menu or the food in general...  Well here's to hoping that they can step up and make it happen!"}
{"text":"I agree with the previous review. Based on my experience yesterday, this review is really a 1.5 star review in disguise. But when I went for dinner, it was their opening night, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that they will work out their issues and run more smoothly. Otherwise, I would not come back.   The decor has changed little from the previous Inka Heritage incarnation. We sat down with menus, decided to order a duck clay pot, Phnom Penh curry and a pho deluxe. It wasn't clear who our waitress is, and after a while when nobody checked in on us or even asked if we wanted to order drinks, I notified a staff member that we were ready to order and she then sent someone over to take our order. Not a good start, but I was already getting the distinct impression from the faces of the other patrons in the restaurant that service was going to be a real issue tonight. We put in our order around 6:15pm. At 6:30, I wondered to my dining partner whether we'd be able to get out of here before the Packers game started at 7:30pm. Spoiler alert: we did not.   Because of where we were seated, I could see right into the kitchen. While we waited for our food, I watched 6-7 staff members stand around in the kitchen while the chef held a bunch of tickets in their hand, all trying to figure out what had been ordered or what needed to be fired. I watched our \"waitress\" stand around in the kitchen, holding a bowl of fried rice, looking lost, deliver it to the wrong table, then went back into the kitchen and stood around some more until the chef came out and told her which table. I'm sorry, but front of the house staff should never require the chef in the back of the house to come out and tell them how to do their job. Maybe some training for the staff before they start? I then watched a woman show up halfway through the dinner service, take a menu and a piece of paper and proceeded to write things down. It was curious because it didn't look like she was taking somebody's order. I had an idea of what she was doing when the other hostess/waitress said in Chinese, \"You can't write it like that. He won't understand it.\"  Sure enough, at one point the chef came out of the kitchen with a ticket and asked, \"what is this? show me on the menu.\" \"Ohh,\" says the chef after the woman pointed it out. It was clear that there was no system of communication between front of house and back of house, and possibly even an language barrier. I watched a table next to us order two orders of spring rolls. When our \"waitress\" brought out two orders, but one saucer of dip, the patrons asked for another one. The \"waitress\" actually suggested that they just share the sauce before conceding and going back in the kitchen. The rest of their order came out before they had to ask yet again for that second saucer of dip from another \"waitress\".    So what about the food. At 6:55pm (40 minutes after we ordered), we finally got our bowl of pho. The rest of our order then trickled out one by one. It baffles me that it took 40 minutes for a bowl of pho. I mean, I get it, pho is a slow process, but presumably, the broth should've already been made. The curry came next, and was very under seasoned.  Salt helped it out. The duck clay pot was tasty, and I liked it. It had a fried egg on top with a still runny yolk, and had a szechuan spice. We liked the pho too, though it wasn't quite your typical pho flavors.   Given how incompetent the wait staff was, I waved them down and asked for boxes and a check while my friend was polishing off the pho. Boxes came, but no check or even a \"I'll be right back with your check.\" We decided to just go up to the register to pay. It then took 3 people standing around to figure out how we can pay our check. They lost our check because the waitress set it somewhere, never gave it to the person ringing up the check, and it got lost under a pile of menus. Time we finally got out of there was 7:35pm.   Here are some friendly suggestions for the business owner. Have an established system of communication between front of house and back of house. Your menu items are numbered, use that if necessary. Train your staff before you open so they learn the system of communication, where they should put a ticket after they've taken an order. Make sure your staff has specific tasks so they know who's responsible for what. Put less tables in the dining space. If your kitchen can't handle that many tables at once, don't seat that many tables. You'll lose customers and your business if anybody has to wait as long as we did for their food. Wait until your kitchen staff and wait staff is running smoothly before adding more tables. Plus, it may be worth your while to have fewer tables but turn them over faster."}
{"text":"The clay pot is SO GOOD, and that is the only reason I'm giving a 3-star. The staff is sorta a mess. Slow service and the food took forever to get out. The pho was ok, nothing special. My biggest problem with this restaurant is the TV. It was so loud and the whole staff (even the cooks when our food was out) was sitting in the dining room watching it. Tip for the owners: get rid of the TV, turn on some nice, soft music, and teach your staff to bring out ALL the food out at once."}
{"text":"I stopped for lunch and there were 2 curry options. One was $12.95 and the other was $15.95. I don't know why they don't have a lunch menu at lunch time.   Someone who worked there was at a table paying bills with his phone on speaker. That was very annoying. It was also so cold in there that me and 2 other customers had our jackets on.  I got the curry and it was ok. It had a lot of potatoes in it which was fine but there was about 3 times as many potatoes as there was meat. I ate about 6 bites of pork."}
{"text":"What I appreciate about this place is that it is true to the spiciness as it would be if it were in Cambodia. We were warned and I didn't expect it to reach the traditional level of spiciness. But it did and I was impressed.  Unfortunately, I was looking for more authentic Cambodian dishes that we haven't already seen in Madison's Thai restaurants. Some flavors were hit or miss. I'd like to give this place another try, maybe a bit later once they figure out the menu a bit more."}
{"text":"I loved the food. I was little skeptical seeing the low star reviews on Yelp, but as all other restaurants were fully packed thanks to Badger-vs-Gophers game, we end up going there. We had Pho and BaBow, both tastes really delicious. The Pho was one of the best I had in town. The server informed they have worked hard on improving the menu after the initial bad reviews. I would definitely recommend this place."}
