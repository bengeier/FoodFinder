{"text":"I don't know where to begin with sweetDee's bakeshop: the staff is friendly and engaging, the food is delicious, and the drinks are unique and refreshing. The design of the shop manages to create a feeling of familiarity and comfort while simultaneously demonstrating an effortless mastery of modern ambiance. The aesthetic of this coffee shop is on-point and they flawlessly deliver. If you're in the area, stop by. If you're not in the area, it's worth the drive. The drinks in the picture are an espresso-tonic (tall cup) and an iced lavender latte (short cup)."}
{"text":"I work just down the street and stopped in with a friend. SO HAPPY WE DID! The pinks and green decor is beautiful and chic. The baked goods and lavender hibiscus tea is dreamy! I will be sending the \"Dee's Nuts\" donut boxes as gifts 100% lol! Such a cute spot!"}
{"text":"Firstly I love the sense of humour they have going on here, \"Dee'sNuts\" are the perfect mouthful! and with a share size package there's enough to take home for the family.  Presentation, design and execution is unbelievable, you can't stop looking around as soon as you walk in. From the simple yet visually stunning design of the store to the impeccable detail and artful creation of each baked good Sweet Dee's is a treat for the senses!  I tried quite a few different \"Nuts\" and each one so light yet so uniquely flavoured but I still have more to try so to announce a favourite would be unfair (standby for more).  My advice to anyone going would be to bring friends as this will allow you the ability to try more of what Sweet Dee's has to offer.  Great job and I look forward to stopping by again soon :)"}
{"text":"most delicious pastries-as good or better than ones i've had in europe! Coffee and sandwich were delicious too. Super friendly staff. A must try in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This cute little bakery/cafe just opened up and is already bustling. Their bakery selection is diverse and keeps all sorts dietary concerns in mind. With their large array of light flavors, stopping in for a quick bite didn't leave me heavy only satisfied. But for those wanting a bit more, they do offer larger food options for those with an appetite.  The atmosphere is more Parisian and while I usually like my coffee shops warm and cozy this place is nothing but welcoming. This place's only slight in my mind is the lack of seating but it's not enough to lose a star over.  If you're nearby I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
