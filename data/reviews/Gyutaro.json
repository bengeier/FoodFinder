{"text":"It's honestly one of the best Japanese restaurants I have been in Toronto, everything - including the sides, are perfect and tasty! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was average but very worth the price! The customer service is exceptional! I'm a huge fan :)"}
{"text":"don't order the curry noodles. they literally just slap a bunch of curry on a bowl of udon. food was pretty shit but the serving girl was so nice i broke down in tears."}
{"text":"Dont think they know what they are doing. The service is nice but the food is terrible. The chef is like 20 years old and dont even know how to use microwave. The food is salted. For sure they have added MSG. Im really sensitive to MSG and my mouth has been dried for two hours now. They definitely do no deserve 4 star rating. Won't return and won't recommend to any of my friends."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but this food was so horrible I had to say something.  Just ordered Gyudon Beef Bowl with Egg, Noodle with Egg and Fried Dumplings through Fedora.  The only thing i could eat were the dumplings, and they were okay, but you could get better dumplings in the frozen food isle of a grocery store. The other two items consisted of boiled noodles with no sauce, a hard boiled egg, and boiled beef with no seasoning on white rice.  Absolutely no flavour."}
{"text":"I had the Takoyaki and Gyudon. Really good with reasonable price. Be sure to add a raw egg to make it even better. Deserts are really good too, specially the mochi ice."}
{"text":"We got the chicken katsu combo, beef bowl on rice, and creamy croquette.   The beef tasted pretty good although the beef to rice ratio is unbalanced in that there is so much more rice compared to beef.   The chicken katsu tasted good and I find the meat to rice ratio is a bit more balanced for this menu item.  The creamy croquettes were good."}
{"text":"Ordered the gyudon with a raw egg. It was delicious. Making your meal a combo is so worth it. (Soup, salad, and mochi) very student budget friendly"}
{"text":"Got the gyu don with extra meat, the beef was just a paper thin layer. Lack of flavour too for the beef. Donburi makes way better gyu don with more generous portion size.   Takoyaki is nothing special either, definitely will not eat here again"}
{"text":"Food: Curry Udon: the curry was too watery. I also added fried chicken on top, and fried chicken was super small and nothing special. Beef Bowl: the beef was overcooked/over minced. Not very flavourful either.  Service was always very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from this place at least 3 times and the quality of the food gets worse and worse! I was so excited for this place when I first tried it because the food tasted so good for the price! But the latest time I ordered from them (beef bowl and Unagi don), the rice for both bowls were undercooked! Maybe it's time to look for a place for gyudon given the inconsistency from this place... So disappointed..."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. Seen a lot of places come and go in this area but I want this one to stay!  I tried the fried chicken with rice and it was delicious, and for $7 including tax how could you go wrong. Got my food to go but interior is nice and modern and staff were polite and efficient.  Not much else to say except try it yourself. I might actually try the beef bowl tonight so if this review is unchanged it means I enjoyed that just as much as my first experience!  It'll be a sad day if this place doesn't last but I know competition is fierce in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed when we ordered dinner here using the Uber Eats app.  We got 2 orders of the tofu don with rice, 1 order of the tofu don with noodle and curry, and a side of seaweed salad.  The tofu don with rice was pretty much flavourless, the tofu don with noodle and curry arrived with barely any curry sauce, and finally the seaweed salad was literally only 2 small spoonful.  Will definitely never order from here again."}
{"text":"I read about this place on BlogTO but was disappointed with the food. I had the chicken curry, takoyaki, okonomyaki, and kimchi fries. The prices were decent but I would not go back."}
{"text":"The price and the quality ratio is just unbelievable. $7.00 including tax for a meal save my day, no more heavy change on my pocket. For this kind of price you can't find anywhere to beat that"}
{"text":"Not only did the food come extremely late but I would have appreciated if the manager had told us the truth from the beginning. Although we were told they were understaffed and there is a huge delay an hour and a half into waiting for our food. We were told multiple times that the food is coming out within 5 mins. It took a 30-45 mins to receive our full order, so in total we had waited almost 2.5 hours. By the time we had received our last order, most people had already finished their food.  We did have a bigger group and yes, we would have probably left if we were told they were understaffed from the start. But it would have been for the better for both parties. We would have been a lot more understanding and this would not have spoiled a chain of events we had planned for the evening.   Not to mention the udon was served with the server's finger in the soup.... For extra flavour? No thanks.   Lastly, a friendly suggestion, if your customer had received such terrible service on their first visit. I don't think a free stamps card  to free ice cream and 'special accommodations' on their next visit would convince them back. Yes, we did have to pay FULL price but hey... We CAN get free ice cream if we come back.   All in all, I am very disappointed that the manger did not make better protocols and judgement in this situation."}
{"text":"We waited for a good 20min in a nearly empty restaurant for bowls of thin, heavily salted broths and udon. The selection is so limited that your udon either comes with veggies or protein, but not both together in one bowl. Very dissatisfying experience."}
{"text":"The service was really good. The prices also isn't that bad. I always get the fried chicken with rice, which is $7. The fried chicken is so good, like really good. Also for some reason it isn't that busy so I can work there while I eat since the noise level isn't too loud."}
{"text":"I tried the Okonomiyaki ($9), and the Ginger Pork Rice ($7).  I was impressed with both the quality and the value. The decor is fresh, clean and modern.  I am definitely recommending to my friends."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of fast food chain restaurant where food are served on the go and at an affordable pricing. The dishes were mediocre at best and the gyudon which is the store's signature dish falls short of expectation. The beef were a bit on the salty side and there were too much rice with too little beef. By the time we worked through half of the bowl, there were only rice left. I've had much better gyudon at other parts of the city."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0  Ordered the gyudon and beef udon noodle soup. Both items were pretty decent in terms of flavour.   However, the gyudon could have a bit more beef and onions as there was quite a bit of rice, and the udon noodles could have been a bit more al dente. Both are easy improvements which would put them at 4 stars if they decide to make that happen.  Service was very attentive and welcoming. Would drop by again for a quick and easy meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and let me start off with good customer service, the man who works there (not sure if he's manager) but he always has a positive attitude. The food was good too and the price is good! The menu has a fair amount of things you can choose from, for one portion it costed only $7 (tax included) everything on the menu is tax included which is great. He also offered this stamp card which was nice.  overall the place it's self is a nice place with good food and prices.... I also spotted while looking around they also had game boards, I'm assuming it's for the customers to play with. Anyways I will be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Location There is a Green P parking lot right behind this building. It is also TTC-accessible, you just have to walk like 2 minutes from Bathurst station.  Service This is not like a fine dining Japanese restaurant; I would say it's more of a fast-food place. Unlike McDonald's, you can order your food and sit at a table waiting for someone to deliver it. It's not a very big restaurant so the waiters/waitresses can spot you. Kira (manager) is very welcoming and gives really good recommendations on what dishes would fit your taste.  Food Ladies and gentlemen, this is by far one of the best gyudon I've had in Toronto. Gyudon originates from Japan and it is literally beef on rice, maybe a few changes with the sauces and toppings. I ordered the gyudon topped with cheese and holy cow, it is phenomenal! The cheese topping is not overwhelming so you can still taste the meat and it mixes so well! Anyhow I was extremely impressed, got to give them a thumbs up for this dish. Not many Asian dishes incorporate cheese very well into their food but this one, damn son! I would also recommend the milk and green tea as drinks. Their dessert is average, with the classic cheesecake fairing as the best choice out of the bunch. At a low low cost of $7-9, you can fill your tummy for the night."}
{"text":"It really is as good as it gets Imma take this time to go about all the reasons I love this place   I was really excited to try this place out because honestly the red just was screaming in to me,  and when i walked  I felt so at peace. this place has a really chill atmosphere it's a nice place to hang out too the staff here are extremely friendly.  RIGHT AFTER THAT, THEY HAVE ALL THE PRICES INCLUDING TAXES AND THEY ARE EVEN, no 6.99c Bullshit (honestly I hate carrying too much change around)  Another thing i like about this place is that they have a good menu, have you ever been with someone and they can't make up there mind because the menu has too much options. You wont have that problem here. I can't wait to try other things on the menu Even BREAKFAST  For me the food is exactly like comfort food But the curry was something I'd come back for It wasn't to spicy and was very savoury, the potatoes and carrots were well cooked and would easily mash in your mouth with the sweet and nutty flavour of the curry, personally i like my curry with heat but they have sriracha if you need it. The chicken in the curry was well cooked stringy and had moisture in it (so it wasn't dry and hard to break apart)   their takoyaki is well done i love how the nicley put the mayo on it and seaweed. the karage is crispy I also love it with hot sauce"}
{"text":"Their food was okay, but came out far too slowly. Even instant noodles would taste amazing if you have to wait 1.5 hours for a beef noodle soup.  Once again, I would like to emphasize that Gyutaro is super.......slow."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner with my friends during my 20th birthday - keep in mind we had several events planned thereafter.   We arrived at the restaurant at 8:20, placed our order by 8:30. Throughout the next hour, the side dishes would come one at a time every half hour - and our main dishes would come in pairs of two bowls at a time. This is the type of restaurant that will serve main dishes, and your friends will finish before the next person receives theirs (we are a considerate group as well - we usually wait for everyone to receive their food before we begin to eat.)  Furthermore, there were still main dishes (curry beef udon, unagi rice) coming to us at 10:15 - absolutely ridiculous as we got there at 8:20. It seemed that they cared more about meeting their delivery requests on time than satisfying customers inside their restaurant. Incomprehensible and completely upsetting.   The only thing the owner offered for an UNHEARD of TWO hour wait was three stamps instead of one on their loyalty card. Free ice cream with three stamps for two hours of time which literally ruined our other plans (no exaggeration, at all, we finished watching the second half of the Celebrity NBA All-Star games on their TV and the ENTIRE Rising Stars All-Star game).  I would definitely not recommend coming here; the food is average at best but the wait time is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"I work in the neighbourhood and choices for quick, good takeout food are sometimes abysmal (\"PIZZA FROM WHICH OF THE SIX PIZZA JOINTS? SUSHI FROM WHICH OF THE FOURTEEN?!?\").  This place is amazing. I call ahead to order my food and the customer service is so pleasant.  I've tried almost everything on the menu and yes, their gyudon is amazing but I'm addicted to the Ginger Pork rice bowl. It's just the right amount of ginger mixed in with a generous heaping of warm pork over rice, it's great. 7$ tax included! I also once splurged on a 3$ slice of green tea swiss roll, and while it was amazingly yummy, I felt it was a bit pricey.  (and just a heads up, their Seaweed Noodle is a COLD dish of their seaweed salad mixed with cold udon.)"}
{"text":"I ate there today and order the gyudon with curry and egg, along with edamame. It is very affordable at 12 dollar, and most importantly, it taste fabulous.   The gyu don, beef don, remind of yoshinoya i had in japan. Very thinly sliced beef, with what I believe it is cook in its own broth. The combination of the broth and the rice is beautiful, it is very savoury and packed with umami. The additional raw egg simply add another dimension of flavour to it.   The curry is also very delicious, i won't consider it to be spicy though. Its a very thick sauce that goes great with rice, u get the sweetness from the carrot, the savoury from the onion and the thick texture from the potato. Its quite a traditional taste but on a slightly sweet side. I suggest the curry on the side though, both the beef don and the curry have a strong and distinct taste, so by doing so, you can enjoy it as two dish on its own.   Only complaint is the Edamame(basically is bean with salt,) was slightly under salt, but its a subjective thing i guess.   And price, almost everything is under 10 dollar, tax included, tips no expected. I mean, if you are broke, its a pretty solid choice. If you are not, still go try it, happy dining~"}
{"text":"Thanks to Gyutaro for a nice lunch today! We had the signature gyudon (beef rice), fried chicken and lava egg. All tasty with a really good price point. Had a bit of trouble checking in with Yelp but still got the nice combo offering. Thanks for adding another yummy choice for the Annex! :)"}
{"text":"Good place overall but could use improvements. The food was good and we got the free combo from checking into yelp which was nice. However, they seemed a bit understaffed which is kind of a shame.  The area near the washroom also had a strong garbage smell and its a bit unappetizing to go there and get our drinks.  However its a good place for lunch and the price is very reasonable. They ran out of green tea ice cream and gave us mochi ice cream which was very nice of them. I hope they can make some improvements and this place could be solid."}
{"text":"This new Japanese place just recently opened and I was excited to try it out. The atmosphere is quite casual and hip: they have a walk up and order method, the decor is very modern, the menu is plastered onto large TV screens...The overall vibe can be compared to a modern Japanese food court/fast food chain.  We ordered the beef gyudon with curry and fried chicken and rice combo to share. With the combo (extra $3), you get miso soup, soft drink, and mochi covered green tea ice cream. The miso soup is pretty bland compared to other places; however, the mains were unexpectedly delicious. The fried chicken and rice comes with a sriracha mayo sauce drizzled on top. Although the overall dish was a bit dry, the chicken was crispy and juicy. I was most impressed with the gyudon with curry, a combination of Gyutaro's signature dishes. Everything was tender and flavourful, but know that Japanese curry is quite different than other curries. Finally, we were able to share a piece of the mochi they served to us after our meal, which was the cherry on the cake albeit a bit melted.   I was utterly impressed by the quality and price of the food here, and would most definitely be back to try some of their sweet treats (green tea smoothie, latte, cheesecakes, and other desserts)."}
{"text":"A new favorite! If you love Japanese comfort food, Gyutaro is a must try. Definitively make it a combo; refillable drink, miso soup, and ice mochi can't beat."}
{"text":"We just had dinner here tonight and.... It was o----kay. Nothing really was special about it. Our first thoughts were, for a Saturday night, this place was empty. It was just me and my 3 other companions. We were first intrigued by the looks of the previously posted pictures because it looked like Yoshinoya so we gave it a shot.  We ordered the following: Beef Gyudon, Beef Gyudon with Raw Egg, Beef Noodle Soup, Takoyaki, Fried Chicken, Fried Dumplings, and Unagidon. Since we used the Yelp check-in, we got the free upgrade combo which came with a miso soup and an ice cream.   First - service. The server who attended to us was very pleasant and very helpful. He explained how the food is to be ordered. Being the only customers there, he was obviously just focused on delivering good service.   Second - serving sizes. The sizes are relatively small. The rice bowls were REALLY small. Almost like an oversized ice cream bowl. Portion and proportion should also be considered. The beef bowl lacked in proportion with beef to rice ratio. Too much rice, too little beef.   Third - value for money. This is debatable because the prices ranged from $6-9 a bowl. But again, that's cheap for a downtown meal. But the value you get, to us wasn't worth it because we mainly got rice. The beef bowl should have had more beef in it or the bowl itself should've been bigger. The unagidon as well. The beef with noodles was okay but not great.   This place has potential but hopefully they work on it. Add more moisture to their beef bowls too. When presenting their food, make sure it looks like the pictures displayed (i.e. chicken should have dressing drizzled on top and not served on the side - believe me, sometimes presentation is all it takes to take a first time guest to becoming a returning customer)."}
{"text":"Very modern little restaurant on Bloor. They have a very large selection of different Japanese delicacies, and are very very fairly priced. It's like a little take-out joint that will serve you your food too! You have to check this place out."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I enjoyed the quality of the food--Gyutaro's got some tasty stuff--but DAMN, the rice/protein ratio is just terrible. My unagi don (grilled eel bowl) had two modest pieces of unagi for $10 bucks. Of the 3 bowls that we ordered, the chicken curry don had the best ratio. The curry was decent enough to scarf down the excessive rice. (1)  Okonomiyaki is decent but I'm not a fan of the $9 price tag. Skip the fried chicken and dumplings - not much substance for your dollar.  -  (1) On the topic of Japanese curry, I'd encourage you to try Kaiju."}
{"text":"Good food and helpful staff. What more do you need?  They even serve the food in real reusable bowls. Wish they did the same for the tea - but it was good tea."}
{"text":"Great new little place on Bloor!  Their menu isn't extensive, but all the items are unique and interesting.  And best of all, the food TASTES REALLY GOOD!  Staff is friendly.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Years ago, you couldn't find much variety of Japanese food in Toronto besides sushi. Since the Ramen boom a couple of years back and all the izakayas started popping up, now we have a bit more representation and authenticity.  When I lived in Japan, more than sushi, or ramen, or izakaya food, there was another type of food I relied on: gyudon (beef bowls). For the equivalent of $4-5, I could get a quick, delicious, and filling bowl of rice with meat to last me through the day.   When GyuGyuYa opened last year in Toronto I was extremely disappointed. A bowl of gyudon should NOT cost $12-13 with tax and tip. That is ramen territory, which even then is a bit more expensive than in Japan, but that can't really be helped.  Enter Gyutaro. For only slightly more than what you would pay in Japan ($7, tax included and no tip necessary), you get the same authentic taste. And not just gyudon, they offer other things like Japanese curry, udon, karaage (fried chicken) and lots of desserts. The atmosphere is open and relaxed, the staff are friendly, and the food is cheap and delicious.  Why am I so passionate about this place? Because unfortunately, not many people know about it. I only found out through my connections in the Japanese community a month after it opened. It's not ramen or cheesecake so there's no hype, and for many people Japanese food still = sushi. It doesn't help that this place faces some stiff competition from other great restaurants at Bloor and Bathurst.   If you've read this far, I urge you to come and try it! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the store's design & the menu iPad selection. There's always Japanese music playing & a neat TV playing anime. The servers are exceptionally friendly. The rice:food ratio is a bit off as there's way too much rice and not enough food. I love the appertizer menu though and will come back for that. As a review noted before their food bowls are barely the size of their mugs. It's pretty cool to drink fountain pepsi off a neat glass mug though!   I checked in on Yelp and received a free combo upgrade that comes with a fountain drink, miso soup & ice cream"}
{"text":"I was happy to see that this wasn't yet another AYCE Japanese food place on Bloor (because there are about 6 of them now). Not only that it's actually owned and run by Japanese people (BONUS!)! The decor is modern, funky, a few tvs around (mostly streaming cp24 and another with anime w English subtitles). They have the often loved, but not easy to find Tatoyaki (fried balls of octopus goodness) on the menu, Japanese curry (also good, mild but fairly flavourful). Today I had the fried chicken special on rice (if you spend more than $7 during certain hours you get a free seaweed salad or miso soup). You go up and order at the counter - both owners were super helpful and friendly, offering suggestions when asked. Then you sit and one of the hard working cooks in the back brings it to your table. Be patient, it appears that they make everything fresh, so I had to wait a few minutes but my chicken and rice and salad were brought out to me with a friendly smile and greeting. THIS FRIED CHICKEN IS AMAZING!! I think I've only possibly had something similar (fried properly so it's not greasy, not many places are able to achieve this). Mouthwatering pieces served on rice. I could eat it again right now! I'll definitely be back. They have coffee time (afternoon) specials and the service couldn't be better. Be sure to pick up a free copy of Bento Box (Japanese Culture) magazine. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"This place is decent for cheap price.  The food is good but nothing too special but will definitely fill you up.  I went during lunch and not much people at all.  I think it's not close enough to the subway that's why there's not enough traffic."}
{"text":"Ate their food a couple of times dining in and delivered by Just Eat. Their prices are really good considering the rice bowls are tasty and a good portion.   The raw egg mixed into the warm rice (the egg would not be cooked) could cause some discomfort depending how sensitive your stomach is. Their seaweed salad was tiny for $2 when I ordered delivery, it's like $1 per bite a total of 2 bites. But overall, the beef combined with rice and onion was so hunger satisfying that they get a 4 star.   For dessert, their cheesecake is worth mentioning. SO good. Maybe because of the super small slice for $4 that the marginal utility for it it's still increasing as I finish it.. Really wish it was bigger. And their icecream mochi which was part of the combo when I ate it was homemade which was yummy too.   Great quality for simple Japanese food. Would come here more often!"}
{"text":"3.5/5  *The restaurant is more of a fast-food place where you have to order at the cashier and a server will bring out the food for you, so don't expect a fine-dining-ish service here.  *A quick glance at the menu, I was surprised to see that all their prices included taxes! Almost everything was under $10 except for a few, but even their most expensive dishes were only at $13, thus Gyutaro is a very student budget friendly restaurant.  -Spring Roll: I don't recall that the filling contain any meat at all, I believe it consisted of vegetables, mushrooms and glass noodle (?). These weren't greasy and had a nice golden brown crispy crust. I liked how the vegetables were not overcooked inside and still had some crunchiness to it. The filling was well seasoned, salty enough to not taste bland with a nice kick of white or black pepper.  -Lava Egg They were exactly how a ramen egg should be. The egg white was softly firm while the golden yolk was creamy and just slightly runny.  -Takoyaki  too doughy and I couldn't find any octopus pieces at all.  -Ginger Pork rice bowl Don't let the word \"ginger\" scare you, the ginger taste was really minimal and not overbearing at all. The pork was tender and succulent, and nicely soaked up all of that sweet soy based sauce.  -Gyudon - Beef bowl with raw egg I thought the beef was a bit too dry so I definitely recommend getting either a raw egg or cheese for an extra dollar to solve that issue. Otherwise the beef was thinly sliced and marinated in a mildly sweet sauce flavored with daishi, soy sauce and mirin."}
{"text":"I had the curry chicken noodle bowl. It tasted like what I imagine Indian cat food would. Revolting."}
{"text":"Went in on a cold day and was one of the three others there. Price for food was super!   I ordered the gyutaro, the beef bowl. Food tasted authentic. We had a great time and the service was great and accommodating.   We watched anime while listening to anime opening music which catered to me and my girlfriend well."}
{"text":"A small little place just a short walk East of Bathurst station. The staff are Chinese so it's not an authentic Japanese place but it's still good for what it is.  You go up to the cashier to order for take-out or dine-in. If you're dining in, you can take a seat and they'll bring the food to you. There's five big television screens in the place, generally playing kpop music videos.  The staff are still in training so they may make some mistakes but the owner or manager I presume is very nice and corrects the issues when you bring it up.  I had the curry chicken noodle and it was yummy but the portion size is a bit on the small side. With the combo, you get a small mochi with ice cream in the centre and a cup for soft drinks (unlimited refills). Their cheesecakes on display are also very small."}
{"text":"I had the beef soup and my dinner date had the chicken bowl. Both were excellent. Flavourful and light. The restaurant is very clean. The service was excellent. Open late. The baseball game was on! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Gyutaro reminds me of the fast food Restaurants in Japan. It's super cheap (around 6.50-9$ a dish), but unfortunately the taste and proportions don't match.  You order though a tablet, which is a horrible experience, the servers were nice about it though. I recommend they cut it out all together. Dishes are hard to find, and the tablet lagged on us twice. The environment is pretty cute and clean.  Food wise, I got the beef don(6.50), despite it being so low cost, it was not great. The meat portions were so small, and taste wise was mediocre. The curry don also tasted really mediocre. We got the kimchi fries which was nothing special. The okonomoyaki and Takoyaki were the only dish I'd say is pretty good. As part of the Yelp combo deal (check in for deal), we got free dessert which was matcha ice cream - you can't go wrong with it."}
