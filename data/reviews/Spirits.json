{"text":"My sister and I were harassed by the bouncer. 

Last night, around 1:00 AM, a group of about 8 of my friends and I decided to go to Spirits Cleveland on W 6th. Seven of us had our IDs checked and walked in. But he wanted a 10$ cover charge for the last man in our group. Wondering if I had somehow just missed the other guys being charged, I gave the ten dollars. We went in and find out he was the only person charged.

We went back to clear it up with the bouncer and he responded by accusing the rest of the men in our group of \"sneaking in.\" Which they absolutely had not. We were obviously upset by this and decided to leave and take the rest of our money with us. 

However, on our way out the bouncer proceeded to yell at my big sister and I that the reason he charged our friend $10 was \"that he didn't look like could suck a good dick.\" He didn't say it once, he repeated it over and over again. Insinuating that we all looked like we could \"suck a good dick\" and that's why we got in for free. 

There was a Cleveland Police officer standing by on post at the bar right next to us. My sister and I were being told to leave by the officer. When we were telling him about the disgusting sexual harassment that just occurred he actually looked right at us and said \"Okay... What do you want me to do about it?\" while the bouncer stood behind him flipping us off repeatedly. 

NOTHING that we did warranted that kind of treatment from the bouncer or the officer. It was an appalling and unfair experience. As sad as it is, the man handling and harassment that comes with going to W. 6th is expected. But what we experienced was too much.

Spirits Cleveland has lost my business and I hope, if you're reading this, they've lost yours too."}
{"text":"Awful. The employees and cook are awesome but owners are the worst. They sit there and watch over the employees which is awkward for customers. While I was there an \"owner\" (maybe?) yelled at an employee in front in me which probably should've happened behind closed doors. The owners are arrogant and don't know how to run an establishment in America obviously. The food is bad which makes me sad because the cook was really nice and came to check on my food to see how I liked it and I said it was good just because he was so nice. My advice is that the employees should find work elsewhere because they are too good to work for people like that."}
{"text":"Great new bar in downtown. I was in town for the night and use Yelp to find the next hole in the wall.  Yelp led me to a dive bar that was closed, so we stopped at Spirits because we were parched from our walk. Stephanie welcomed us to this wonderful new establishment with a smile and a little bit of feral cat.  Just down my alley and the Reuben sandwich was way up there in my top ten list of sandwiches."}
{"text":"It wassss a good lunch and happy hour place to go, but without notice he raised his Daily $5 food special to $7!  The cooks are excellent but the kitchen manager needs to go to training.  The food specials are worth $5 really and should have stayed that way. By the way the owner still advertises $5 for the specials to get you in there to drink and maybe you won't notice your bill."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with Spirits. 

I came here last night with a friend and the service was quick and the beers were good. It wasn't very crowded at 10:30p on a Friday night, but maybe we were just early. The lights are pretty cool & the music was good but it just felt weird sitting in a room with a buncha laser lights going crazy around you. 

We saw there was an upstairs so we went up to check it out and someone came and yelled at us saying we can't be up here because it's closed...ok then block of the stairwell?...Sucks too because the upstairs looked really awesome. 

I heard good things about their food so I'll probably be back for a happy hour & to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"We peeked our nose in and a friendly gentleman shouted \"Come in!\". We were from out of town, waiting for a Brown's game, and it was cold and rainy. The gentleman made excellent french fries; we would have eaten more, but of course we're vegan. I would've given it a higher rating for at least one plant based option on the menu. Game day drink specials were good. I'm sure there are better places to drink, but when someone is so friendly and welcoming..well, they get our business :)"}
{"text":"Miserable experience. I will never go back. Bouncers are rude and intimidating. They harrassed my wife asking her what her bra size is and if she likes anal sex."}
{"text":"Spirits is still in their soft opening stage. My friend and I decided to check it out last night around 9pm. It was a slow night because of the poor weather. The place looks really nice and fits in well on W. 6th. I must say that being a black female, it's kinda iffy when you walk into a downtown establishment. You never know how you're going to be received at some places. The first thing I noticed about Spirits was the music. Hip hop/R&B/Top 40. A great selection. So we sit at the bar and the friendliest bartender comes over and greet us. I believe her name was Stephanie. She was so welcoming. Teresa made our drinks and she was JUST as nice. We stayed a little over an hour and decided that we would definitely be back. The entire staff was friendly and upbeat and appeared to love being at work. Quite refreshing. To the owner...great job at bringing something new to W. 6th and having a great staff even down to the security guards at the door that told us \"Good luck\" when we walked out into the rain. LOL.  Now,  My only suggestion would be to get a larger variety of tequila and possibly flavored Bacardi. That would be awesome"}
{"text":"Our whole night here was a disaster. First, they missed the Cavs ring ceremony because someone changed the channel and couldn't work out how to change it back. They proceeded to play music over top of the commentary. Then everyone missed the start of the World Series because they forgot to change the channel even though everyone on the bar was there for the game. Then they couldn't get the sound working for 20 mins. They were not that busy, staff were not interested, on their phones, and our waitress would just disappear. We ordered food, waited for an hour, didn't arrive. Asked the waitress, then it arrived cold 10 mins later. The burger was actually the highlight of the night when it finally came. We will never come back here. Be warned there is a reason why it's the last bar to fill up on a busy night."}
{"text":"Our favorite bar in Cleveland! Very clean, fun environment, amazing and friendly bartenders. Wish we had a bar like this in Seattle. Hope this new bar will be around the next time we visit town."}
{"text":"Someone stole my wallet and used my credit cards here. Spirits didn't realize that a man was using a woman's credit card and let them get away with spending 700 dollars on my credit cards in 1 hr. Trashy place. I'm glad I've never been there, I'm just pissed they let someone use my credit cards for such a big purchase. Every time I call this place no one answers as well. Sketchy stuff go on here, I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"We made three separate visits to Spirits during our 48-hour visit to Cleveland from Seattle! Plenty of choices to drink, a disco ball the size of a baby elephant, and a cute jukebox photobooth were some of our favorite features of the bar. We'll be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"This place is back open. At least it's open for Browns games. I don't know who owns or manages the place now, but having one of your barmaids wear a Steeler jersey during the Browns Steelers game in Cleveland is not a good look. We left and took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went to Spirits during the soft opening, so please take that into consideration when reading this. I understand that they hadn't received a lot of things on their menu, since they had just opened but some of the things Spirits has doesn't make sense. I'm actually not sure what it's trying to be as it seems it wants to be all things to all people. It's a cigar bar and hookah lounge, a restaurant, a hipster bar and a nightclub, and they have a popcorn machine. They also advertise a healthy menu, but in reality it's typical pub fare with a selection of sandwiches, burgers and apps--not exactly the healthiest. 

Having said that, the food was delicious. I very much enjoyed the turkey burger I received (one of the most healthy options they offer). Although the service was rather slow (it took 10 minutes to get mayo), but I will again chalk that up as \"just opened\" jitters. 

I think the thing that perplexes me the most is their salad bar. It's very tiny and hidden away in the back next to a small soup warmer. It's on a portal unit, I'm guessing so they can move it at night along with the tables and chairs to turn the space into a nightclub. But it just seems unappetizing to me. 

All in all, I'm not sure what to make of Spirits. I will certainly be back at some point down the road and then I'll be able to edit this review after garnering a full experience, but as of yet I'm just not sure what to make of it at all."}
{"text":"Bartender had a huge attitude on a Wednesday night- had my card but refused to serve my friends and I (group of three in a bar of twenty). She was a brat who only wanted to serve men who gave her attention. Thank goodness for sonia. This place won't survive."}
{"text":"I don't think my rating is really legit because I think it is a night club and I went here during \"happy hour\" time...lots of daylight outside lol. There was a few people there, maybe 95% empty. Bartender/server was okay...I was acknowledged lol. Got a cider and some poutine fries (not good), meh.

I should try this place at night, maybe my review would be totally different."}
