{"text":"Really cute Swedish style coffee house. The owner went on student exchange to southern Sweden and fell in love with Swedish coffee culture! (according to staff when I asked)  I lived in Sweden for 6 years and this is the closest thing to a Swedish coffee shop I have experienced outside of Scandinavia.  Scandinavian language speakers seem to frequent Fika too, giving the place an authentic flavour! The coffee is good too and the cinnamon buns are delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy backyard. Their signature fika iced coffee is espresso with milk and mint. It's so unique that worth tasting once. But I don't recommend as usual drink. The taste of black coffer is smoky."}
{"text":"Four and a 1/2 stars for sure. We went today [Sunday] and not surprisingly, Fika was pretty crowded, but we managed to squeeze in next to some backpacks and coats and bags. No problem.   My companion had a latte, as did I [mine with soy ~ of course] and they were really really good.  Hot, rich, creamy, delicious; one of the best lattes I've had on the Indie Coffee Passport.  Along with the latte my companion had a cranberry scone which he said was okay, but not earth-shattering.  I am not a scone fan, so if I were hungry I might have ordered their Quinoa Salad or Grilled Veggie Wrap.  One of the customers had the Mortadella Sandwich and you could smell that Gruyere two tables away.   Tiny samples of baked goods were laid out by the cash and I just had to try: a small bite of butter tart; a section of chocolate-caramel-coconut bar; a segment of a chocolate cookie I think was filled with ganache ... each one oh, so good! The desserts are baked at Splendido and brought over every day, and I would absolutely go back for a full size portion of any of them.  Or all of them. And another latte.  Mmmmm."}
{"text":"(actually the review should be 3.5 stars) Everytime I come back to toronto this Swedish cafe is my go to place for getting work done especially if I need :  a. Good cozy  vibes / cute cutlery / cute everything  b. Good coffee  c. Good food (?- read more below)  d. Space!! And outlets!  Ive tried their spiced cardamom latte and cinnamon roll which were divine especially on a cold winter day. But today I opted for a spiced rose cookie paired with an almond milk cappuccino. The cappuccino was good- no complaints.  However I was a tad disappointed by the cookie since it tasted stale and was difficult to chew on- which was a letdown considering how impressed I was with fika from my previous visits :(   Nonetheless maybe they do other bakery items better - (ive already locked in on their Jam oatmeal cookie the next time I visit! )"}
{"text":"I took my italian friend here for coffee, and she actually liked and enjoyed the latte here!  Approved!  Pastries were amazing too. :)     Nice cute atmosphere, great for chatting with friends."}
{"text":"Great place, so quiet and peaceful. Great coffee and amazing pastry.  We had a wonderful brownie, kardemom latte and kardemom bun."}
{"text":"You can't find a more creative cafe than Fika in Toronto. I first heard of this cafe because of all the instagram posts of their infamous wall covered with books. Upon my first visit, I was greeted by their manager kindly and we had a small chat about how this cafe first started out. Apparently the owner did an exchange in Sweden when she was a student and decided to open Fika after working as a photographer for years. I also had the pleasure to meet the owner the same morning and we did a spontaneous interview for my food blog! The back room is a space where she lets her creativity runs wild and the current book piece is done by a local artist.   Drinks-wise, I'm a huge fan of their lavender white hot chocolate. I usually don't like white chocolate but this one is worth having over and over again! I asked the barista to make me a less sweetened one and it was perfect. Would I come back again? Oh yes."}
{"text":"I just love Kennsington! And this place has awesome patio! I had espresso ( as usual) and I just had to have avocado bread. It was roasted slice of french white bread  with smooth spread made from avocado, then on top sliced tomatoes, pickled red onion and cilantro = another version of guacamole.  I totally fell in love with their cups! Amazing and veryyyy stylish washroom!"}
{"text":"Just love this place. Great service great food and unbelievable service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The coziest and Pinterest worthy coffee shop I have every been in. Staff is generally friendly for a hipster coffee shop. The cardamom latte was delicious, and a very interesting flavor combination that was perfectly foamed and adequately sized, and although I didn't try the baked goods, they looked delicious. A great place to park and recharge for travelers with accessible outlets, plenty of cozy seating, free wifi and clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Ordered the lavender white hot chocolate. It was a very nice comfort drink, drinking it in winter makes it even more amazing. My friend ordered their iced coffee but we were not very fond of the spice added in it. The ambiance was great, wi-fi available and there are power plugs!"}
{"text":"Not only was the coffee amazing but the staff was incredibly kind. They kindly let us change our coffee order without any hesitation! +10 definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"Friendly service who will gladly tell you:  \"Find a seat and we will bring your order to you.\"  The menu is small but very well executed. Their $ 5 lunch sandwich and beverage is probably one of the best values in the city.  The place is certainly not lavish but it is scrupulously clean, even in the bathroom.  Who would not like the back patio? It is surprisingly quiet and even has a nice hammock to lounge in."}
{"text":"Loved it! I would give them 5 stars but it is kind of pricey (for a student at least)"}
{"text":"This place is so adorable, and the warm drinks are perfect for a chilly day!! :) I absolutely love the book wall; it's such a unique idea, perfect for photos!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place through the Indie Coffee Passport.  The passport menu offered a cardamom mint latte that was DELISH - thanks Fika for not offering your crappiest drinks on the passport menu.  I also loved the avocado sandwich, whose coriander, lime and pickled onions elevated the humble vegetarian sandwich to new levels.  How cozy is this coffee shop, like being in a Swedish living room:  I settled right into the throw-covered wingback chairs in front of the fireplace and frankly didn't want to leave.  There is a charming, calm, minimalist Scandinavian decor.    Service is great too!  Will happily return to this great little spot."}
{"text":"Went here for Brunch with another person and had a decent time.The place is nice but the service is lacking especially during the busy hours, this makes enjoying brunch hard if you come with someone else.   Basically you need someone to go sit down and reserve a spot where you can actually eat and someone else to sit in line and order. It becomes awkward when you have to wait in line 10+ minutes to put in an order and another 10+ to get your coffee, and only after you can go sit down and keep talking to your friend. Sure, you can just both wait in line to order but good luck finding a place to sit down after, the place is 100% first come first serve.   I'm sure this is not a problem during regular hours or when it's not busy, but I'd stay away from the place during brunch. Which is a shame since it's the only real thing that differentiates this from any other proper coffee shop (hipster or otherwise)  The coffee is good, high quality, fresh and overall what you'd expect for a proper coffee shop here in Toronto. The food is simple, delicious and looks inviting but I have a hard time justifying the price and wait time. Two Eggs Benny and lattes cost over $40 with a modest tip, so you be the judge on value.  Overall, it's a great place if you live near Kensington and avoid the busy times. The coffees are a bit more expensive than usual but the quality is worth it. I have a hard time recommending that you go out of your way to visit though, Brunch seems like a good reason to go but the haphazard nature of the service kind of ruins the experience."}
{"text":"Cute place, fun atmosphere. One $ sign is very inaccurate. Still hungry after a $11 sandwich which was a lightly dressed piece of crusty bread. A lot of potential and nice people, but wouldn't come again for food."}
{"text":"I splurged on a cardamom-bitters infused chai latte today. I'm glad I did because it was incredible. The tea lattes are a hidden gem here!"}
{"text":"The cafe was a nice, quit, air-conditioned break on our tour of Kensington Market. The Fika iced coffee with mint and cardamon was brilliant, if pricy."}
{"text":"Ordered both the cardamon spiced latte and the lavendar white hot chocolate because I couldnt decide between the two (both popular recommendation by both baristas/public crowd). after tasting the two i must say hands down lavendar white hot chocolate sealed the deal. Ive never tasted a hot drink where the lavendar did not taste like potpourri. just absolutely delicious! the cardamon latte was just okay. i would love to go back to try their food menu and other hot drinks."}
{"text":"I checked out Fika for the 2013-2014 Indie Coffee Passport and I can say that out of the 6 cafes I've visited already, it's easily my favourite. They had no set menu for the passport so I instantly ordered the Lavender White Hot Chocolate without hesitation. The bottom was a bit too sweet for me but overall it was delicious. The cafe itself is wonderful too. Very minimalistic and well-decorated with jazz music playing in the background. I snagged a comfortable armchair and spent a few hours away, happily working away. (The cafe does have wifi.) It's a great spot... if only it were closer to my house!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and coffee at a Fika are both great and how I wish my house was. The coffee was made well and my friend had the cardamom latte which she enjoyed. The choc chip cookie was delicious and soft in the middle. I would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place. Great coffee, delicious cookies and cinnamon buns! The decor was very cute; kind of french meets indie."}
{"text":"The baked goods here were on par with those served at much fancier restaurants (not cafes).  I understand the store doesn't look like a bakery but you'd do well to stop in and pick something up to go.  After eating these you can't go back to a coffee shop with regular baked goods.  They were the best desserts I had at any restaurant, cafe, etc. in Toronto.  The fancy iced coffee seems reaching a bit to justify its price.  It's better than a normal iced coffee but seems to require 2x the labor.  I enjoy watching people work too; sometimes I just want an iced coffee to sip.  The brunch was only 4.5 stars (a bit overpriced and spare) but who said I'm averaging these things?"}
{"text":"Cozy and clean coffee shop In Kensington. Order the white hot chocolate with lavender! So good."}
{"text":"HUGE FAN OF FIKA! I am a regular here and it's my favourite espresso in the area. It is the cutest place and they have AMAZING outdoor seating at the back. It's like a little oasis. Cardamom fig cookie is a really interesting and tasty treat. Breakfast sandwich is delicious! But go early because they sell out! I love fika you will love fika."}
{"text":"Absolute four stars.   Kensington is my must-go place for relax. Thanks for the super convenient neighborhood. I could easily city-hike from china town to Spadina delight: Kensinton.   And Fika, is the delightful stop-by for quick coffee or afternoon break. They have my favorite scone, which always make me miss it when I have to take Timmies tea biscuit.  They also serve very nice espresso.   Find a sunny day in September before leaves all gone , knock in with your favorite books, enjoy treasuring moment in Fika's backyard."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  I came across an article on Condé Nast Traveller, it stated that the world best iced coffee is right here in Kensington Market and had to try it.  From the moment I stepped inside Fika, I felt in love with the Swedish-stye décor, clean, minimal, homey and inviting.    Fika Iced Coffee was very different from other iced coffee drinks I have tried. It was amazing!   There were hints of sweetness and a floral aroma from the coffee.  The freshly crushed cardamon with fresh mint took this drink to another level.  Friendly staff.  Awesome patio (have I mentioned it?).  With the World's Best Iced Coffee title, it's a place I don't mind making a long trek to satisfy my thirst."}
{"text":"The cardamom latte was spiced to perfection with just enough warmth to brighten my day! I wish I had realized they serve brunch, another time for sure."}
{"text":"Sarah was very friendly and made a delicious soy latte.  Cool atmosphere with beautiful artwork."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SO CUTE.   A turquoise gem in Kensington market, FIKA is treasure. Literally, this place place is bright in colour on the outside and bright with natural lighting on the inside.  I've been here for brunch on the weekends and it is also a tasty treat. The plates always look very pretty, like they know they're waiting to be photographed. I'd recommend a benny.   It's slightly difficult to get a table out front, but they have a large communal table room in the back and some space outside. As far as #views go, any space is a score."}
{"text":"World's Best Iced Coffee. Literally.  If you happen to be in the area or just want a really great iced coffee then grab it from here.   The cafe is long so when you walk in there's a good few seats for people right before the beverage and food bar/register. Right behind it is a white room with a light wood coloured community table surrounded by a white wall of written pages from a book that looks like it was fairly well written. The whole feel is very European inspired. So back to my reason for loving this place. The iced coffee is made with cardamom and mint leaves which happen to be on my list of favourite ingredients. The backyard set up with the hammock is almost too perfect for a lazy Indian Sunday kinda chill spot.  The bathroom downstairs is neat and clean. Well done FIKA. Not cutting any corners ; cafe done well :)  xoxo M."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered FIKA Cardamom Spiced Latte and Tea latte.  We also enjoyed Fig Chocolate Cardamom Oat Cookie and Vegan Carrot Date Ginger Muffin with Walnut Streusel and they were very good and the treats were very tasty.  We loved the decor with a whole wall with books as wallpaper.  A lot of great places down at Kensignton and it remains a happening place. Definitely a gem at Kensignton Market."}
{"text":"My favourite cafe i've ever been to in my life:) best place to chill.  Love the ambience and decor at this cafe! Really cute and cosy place:) super affordable menu as well! The staff are really friendly and helpful too. Gonna head back there today:)"}
{"text":"Interesting place to hang out or just to get coffee and walk through during weekends. I didn't know where to go in the China town area and Dark horse was packed. Glad google found me this place so I can enjoy a nice cup of coffee and get some work done."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quiet patio in Kensington to take a call when I happened across FIKA's patio. Ordered the FIKA iced coffee with cardamom and mint and thought it was very different but tasty! If you're looking for a  more traditional iced coffee, this one is not for you. I will be back to try their other drinks and nibblies...   The patio is lovely to sit in and enjoy. FIKA  has a buy 9 get 1 free coffee card. Ask for it and they will keep it on file for your next visit."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend their cardamom latte, it's delicious! Plus the staff was super nice about me forgetting to tell them I needed lactose free milk and fixed my order. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ice cardamon coffee is very delicious.. too much crowded on Saturday, but the out door tabels (infront and back graden) are better choise if weather is good"}
{"text":"LAVENDER WHITE HOT CHOCOLATE?   OK. SOLD.   Most places around the market have grown this sort of pretentious vibe to em, but this place is an exception. The atmosphere is beautiful - simple, comfortable, colourful but not overwhelmingly distracting. Beautiful is a good word methinks.   I stopped in here because I'm doing the indie coffee passport adventure, and I was stuck deciding between the cardamom latte (which sounds delicious) and the lavender hot chocolate (which also sounded just as delicious.) I ended up getting the latter, and they had soy milk available, which was a total win because regular milk makes me nauseous and yeah. all around good stuff :) But the drink itself! It was the perfect temperature, not overly sweet, super yums and served in a solid blue mug that wasn't teeny tiny (i.e. not a rip off) and was simple, but still really nice. Everything about this place seems beautiful in how simple it is.    I would definitely come back. I like."}
{"text":"I love the exterior of the shops and cafes in the Kensington area! Fika is for sure one of the most artsy places I have ever been to. There's a small patio outside and nice cushions and tables inside. They also have interesting paintings and decorations on their walls. When you go further down in the cafe, there's an area where an entire wall is covered with books. Then there's an exit to the \"backyard\" where you'll find more seats with small little tables and a hammock ! For exteriors and interior, I would rate this place 4 stars ( if you love taking pictures, come here !)   When I came here for brunch, I ordered a ham and cheese wrap which came with a salad ( I choose quinoa ) and my friend ordered a breakfast bagel which came with a salad and baked potatoes. I think I would recommend hers over mine because her portion was larger and  cheaper.My wrap was this seaweed looking wrap which I didn't particular love .. but it wasn't bad. On the other hand, the salad was very good and filling.  Perks of eating healthy : leaving your stomach full and satisfied when you only ate a small portion :) I would rate my overall experience a five , I was pretty satisfied ( but then again , I don't think I have very high expectations when I try new places ! )   I need to come back to try our their drinks! Many yelpers recommend the white lavender hot drink, mmmm"}
{"text":"One of my favourite cafes in Toronto! Located right in Kensington it blends right in with the colourful houses. Their iced coffee ($5) is so good and unique (they add cardamom) and is topped off with a mint sprig! Super refreshing on a hot day.   They have 3 separate seating areas, the front has smaller tables and a cushioned area, the back has one huge square table perfect for studying or doing some work and their backyard has a hammock and outdoor furniture!"}
{"text":"I went there for the fist time last weekend. Cute little cafe with a lovely backyard. It felt like we were having breakfast in our own backyard. The staff and owner are very lovely and friendly."}
{"text":"The pistachio ice cream sandwich is gone :( Now they have other flavors but not the same anymore. Just like most ice cream sandwiches and not unique anymore... Bring the pistachio one back guys!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst brunch food I've had. The egg in my breakfast sandwich was overcooked and rubbery. The ham was salty and gross. My cousin had the smoked salmon breakfast taco and it was equally gross. Wasps swarmed the outdoor area which made the gross food even worse."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee here, and with varieties of lattes/drinks I've never seen before (mainly a heavy dose of cardamom with other ingredients).  Their baked goods are also cardamom based and tasty.  I can see why this place is popular, and could see myself coming back."}
{"text":"I have only been to this Little Kensington cafe once, but immediately I fell in love. Right when I walked in I felt like I was at home. The decor is so well done and it instantly gave me a cozy feeling. Also after talking with the owners I found out they had a hammock in the back patio which is just way too awesome.   On to the actual coffee I'd have to say it was 10/10. A good cup o' joe is the key to my heart and they locked it down!   I really have been meaning to try their food as I have heard nothing but good things so I will have to add that to my to-do list for sure.   If you're big on atmosphere and you're looking for somewhere to get coffee I would 100% recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Quaint, cozy shop in Kensington Market that seems to attract the hipster crowd. Space is tight, so if you're looking to tuck in, kick back, and enjoy the free wifi... well, you may be out of luck. I admit that I was one of the jerks who took up an entire table with my laptop and sat there for about two hours with my food and drink. It was never \"packed\" while I was there, but it was busy. Every table had a laptop on it, and every person looked lost in their screens. Overall, a decent choice for cafe work.   The food sounded better than it actually was. Maybe I should've opted for breakfast. I got the fig, prosciutto, and gruyere grilled cheese with the beet and kale salad. The beet and kale salad was 90% beet to 5% seeds/dressing and 5% kale. I didn't taste the mint, but I did taste the citrus. It was okay. I expected more of a balance of the flavors. The sandwich was the LOUDEST, CRUNCHIEST SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I kept getting dirty looks every time I took a bite. Again, the description sounded better than the real thing. It was just okay. Pass on both.   I smelled all of the teas. I ended up with the sakura rose because it smelled the most balanced to me. It was pretty mellow, but nice. The girl behind the counter was very friendly and offered me some honey to go with it. The tea was the highlight of my trip.   Stick to the beverages and you should be okay."}
{"text":"While on a trip to Toronto we decided to stop in here and take a break. My wife ordered the iced coffee and I just had an americano it came to 8.43 mostly due to the ice coffee as they charge over 5 bucks for that with tax. After my wife decided to take a bathroom break the server came over and bussed our table????? I was done but before I had the chance to react she was pouring my wife's drink down the sink. I could not understand what just happened? My wife came back and said \"Where is my drink\" I looked over at the server who was singing a song that was playing out loud like nothing just happened and said she took it. This was the strangest feeling. I would suggest if you order here you clearly tell the staff to not bus your table under after you leave."}
{"text":"Read great things about their homemade ice cream sandwich and great nibbles and was excited to try out FIKA. My friend from Tokyo and I popped in one lunch time and they had no ice cream sandwiches and only enough food for one of us. We left. Very disappointing. Looks like they're happy serving only coffee or hot chocolate to people sitting with their laptops. Certainly not a serious place."}
{"text":"I came here as part of Indie Coffee passport 2013. There are quite a few cafes in this area which cover two extreme i.e. poor to very good. This place falls into the later category thankfully. The setup is nice and clean with  an open inviting seating area with bright light adding to the ambiance on a cooler day. They advertise that their scones are one of the best in the city so had to try one of those. The scone was decent. They seem to have spared no expense in certain area, how often does one see mugs/cups from Le Crueset at a cafe! On to the main event of cappucino.  Here is the verdict Espresso: Medium/strong flavor Crema': Just gorgeous  Milk: Frothed very well with nice microfoam. Latte Art: Good High marks here folks as this is a cappuccino done well. The size is your traditional take so if you are expecting an over sized version of this drink you have been told.  4 Stars. Update I came here to try the highly rated Iced Coffee with cardamom (sans the mint as they were out) it is quite good so worth a try if you are into cold coffee."}
{"text":"I like the interior of this coffee shop and the outdoor seating area. I was intended to try the Fika iced coffee, but they ran out of mint. So I had their Cardamon spiced latte. Unique taste, but the spice was too strong for me.  The grilled sandwich looked good. Might return to try."}
{"text":"Really cute place for a coffee break or light breakfast/lunch!    The decor is so clean and so fresh!  I didn't want to leave.  Soothing music playing in the  background.....  I had a toasted (panini pressed) ham and cheese croissant.  It was flaky and light and perfect.    Great patio in the front too."}
{"text":"3 Stars.  What a great spot in Kensington Market. There are a few more coffee places in the market, but those seem a little grungy and have an edge to them. Fika is clean and simple. The brightness of the colours they used to decorate are great and the big window in the front lets a ton of natural light in.  The coffee meets the expectation of good coffee. I had the cappuccino and it was nice to have a REAL cappuccino, not a latte called a cappuccino. The taste of it made you wanting more.  They are a coffee shop; this is what they do. Some places have ok coffee with liquor, food, and so much more, but they don't have an identity. This place has an identity: they make good coffee. They have minimal food options available, which I like because the food doesn't define them, the drinks do.  For those who like a little spice their Cardamom Spiced Latte is the drink of choice.  The place is just great and is the place I will come to in Kensington. Very clean, very nice.  Well done Fika!   That's it."}
{"text":"Delicious treats (recommend the cardamom white chocolate bar) and drinks (all must try the lavender white hot chocolate) in a homey environment. Shout out to the amazing staff!"}
{"text":"Great food taste, great coffee, and friendly people.  Would have given 5 stars if not for the dirty tables and dirty stained upholstery."}
{"text":"This a cute cafe in Kensington market. Definitely insta-worthy but people and FIKA need to realise that some people would like to come and sit there to actually drink their coffee. Most people are there working and have no plans of leaving the place. Honestly, people would like to enjoy their coffee and company at the location. I ordered the Lavender White Hot Chocolate. The lavender and cardamom quantity made it quite bitter."}
{"text":"Very nice place but the service is slow and you would hope the waiter/waitress here would have gone to Starbucks for some efficiency training . Or they are trying to create a I'm just an art student who is starving and serving coffee is only my side job so sorry I don't know what your order - vibe.... The food is ok and the coffee is ok ..."}
{"text":"Come here for the atmosphere and the instafamous book wall! The latte was average and we didn't order any food but the lady beside us did and it looks sooo good. It's a pretty good place for relax, read or study! Lots of tables including a large one at the back where the book wall is! During the warmer months it's super nice to relax on their patio. I also love their choice of music.   Such a charming coffee shop! I love it"}
{"text":"There's a Danish concept called \"hygge\", which \"in essence...means creating a warm atmosphere and enjoying the good things in life with good people\". Fika embodies this concept of coziness to a T.  It has all the hallmarks of my favourite type of cafe: excellent natural lighting, homey decor, good coffee and light fare in case you're peckish. Bonus features: their instantly Instagram-worthy paperback wall and those shelves upon shelves of dainty vintage teacups.   I first tried their famous iced latte with mint and cardamom bitters. Now I'm totally enamoured by cardamom in my coffee, so only ever come here for either the iced coffee or spiced cardamom latte. Though I have found my absolute favourite cardamom soy latte in this city elsewhere, I enjoy the ambiance of Fika, especially when I have a moment to sit and enjoy the hustle and bustle of Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Probably my most favourite cafe in Toronto. Cozy, comfortable and charming -- just my sort of aesthetic with pastel colours and cute little cups. Service is amazing, the WiFi works just fine, and the food and drink has excellent taste. The wall lined with books with the large communal table makes it one of my favourite spots to get quiet time. I definitely recommend the FIKA latte and lavender hot chocolate!"}
{"text":"The most \"un-Kensington Cafe\" in Kensington, reminds me more of a cafe I might find adorning the likes of Queen East, and that's a good thing in my books. I loved how the more I walk in the more I realise just how much seating there is, from the front patio, main area, communal back table all the way to the back patio which had some wicked looking seating spots (all occupied during my visit). Bonus points for having a kickass \"book wall\" in the back! And yeah, \"cute\" would be what I would use to describe this place.   I ordered a latte and a vegan nut and berry bar, the latte was ordered with almond milk, but I didn't really taste any difference, but the highlight was definitely the nut and berry bar, they had free samples at the counter and I knew it was the perfect thing to munch on with my drink.   I still really enjoy the coffee at some of the other Kensington coffee spots, but Fika wins for being the type of cafe I would want to visit if I was having my coffee \"for here\"."}
{"text":"really good coffee and friendly service. one of the best cappuccino ive ever had outside of italy"}
{"text":"Their iced coffees and espressos are delicious! We live in San Diego, and an iced coffee at Fika is a must stop, have to have one when we're here! It's so cute and clean inside, everyone that works here has always been so friendly, and the pastries look incredible, too. Really like this place :)"}
{"text":"I really liked my visit to Fika. It was a quiet and clean cafe, much like many around Toronto but the atmosphere and simplistic decor made it different.  I would say close to a Scandinavian feel, Fika is a Swedish coffee shop that serves good coffee and offers front and back patios which make it perfect for the summer. After speaking to the barista, she informed me that 'Fika' meant 'to take a break' or 'coffee break' in Sweden (Used like, lets go for Fika).  While the front patio had a squared picnic table for communal seating, the back patio was more like a backyard with a porch (actually, that's what it really was). Finished with patio furniture and a hammock hovering above the grass, it was a great setting just to relax and chat. The inside was very modern/contemporary and if you can just imagine an IKEA kitchen or cafe, that's exactly what you step into.   Overall I liked the patio seating, the backyard atmosphere, the friendly service and good cappuccinos. It was a new experience with different vibe than any other coffee place I've been to in Toronto."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches in the city!  Small, simple and  delicious.   Salmon Benedict cooked perfectly.   Coffee was excellent.     Service was warm and welcoming.     Really nice patio in the sunshine was full at the front so we sat in the garden in the back.    See you again next Saturday!"}
{"text":"I'm hooked on the Lavender White Hot Chocolate, but who isn't?!  Fika is the first place I stop by when visiting Kensington.  The wifi is strong, and the Lavender White Hot Chocolate is amazing - it doesn't get better than that.    Would visit this place more often if it weren't for the overall lack of space and seating.  Not complaining, I still adore this place, but it is a deterance."}
{"text":"Love their FIKA iced coffee (tastes like cardamom and mint, like an iced chai) and cardamom bun. Gone back twice just for the iced coffee. Their patio is pretty too. Love it!"}
{"text":"Do you ever go to a place and it just reminds you of a different world?  I was in Stockholm in August 2017, and visiting FIKA on a sunny Sunday afternoon just brought back all the good memories from my stay in Sweden. The laid back afternoon vibes, the cinnamon buns I would eat during my morning commute as I traveled through the old town, the subtle but beautiful design that I found in every shop.   As I sat in the back, surrounded by cute plants and with The Pixies playing in the background, it felt like I had stepped into a different world, enclosed within the confines of this cute cozy coffee shop.  Maybe I've been reading too many books involving magical realism and parallelism, but there was definitely something poetic and whimsical about my Sunday afternoon at FIKA. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to work or hang out with my friends in Toronto. The ambiance is beautiful.  I usually get the Breakfast Wrap (i believe that's what it was called) since it's gluten free and it's amazing.  It's ultimate place to go when i have nothing to do, or just want to catch up with my friends.n"}
{"text":"You've probably seen their book wall on your Instagram feed, but did you know about their signature iced coffee spiced with cardamom and mint? The iced coffee is comparable to Philz for anyone from San Francisco. They've got a great patio for the hot summer days and a communal table in the back that's great for doing work. Only issue I had with the place was that they don't offer wifi on weekends during the summer months... so maybe avoid this place if you're trying to do work."}
{"text":"A super quaint coffee shop selling an assortment of baked goods, self made chocolate and hot/cold drinks.  It's a quiet place to get some work or reading done, as they even have an outdoor patio with cushioned furniture to sit on.    The face of one of the walls in this cafe are lined with old books, making it a stunning work of art as well as a useful way to recycle old paper.    I got an Earl Grey Tea, a drink that warms the stomach as well as the heart."}
{"text":"Located right in the middle of Kensington market, this coffee shop is the perfect midday coffee spot. There is a patio out front, but once you walk in you realize there's many seatings for 2 or for groups of 2 or more. Then you walk past the baristas and there is a big table, the perfect study spot! But the best part is the patio outside that is shaded by big trees, and there is a HAMMOCK! Yes a hammock you can lie on and take a little nap! The coffee is delicious! I had the fika iced coffee and it had this spiced flavor to it that made it stand out from other iced coffees i have ever tried, something I definitely would recommend! I also had their oatmeal cookies, and omg I want another one right now!  Overall, I think I found my new coffee spot!"}
{"text":"[26/100]  (Instagram photo opp alert! Their book wall is insta-famous)  Located in an eclectic neighborhood, I have yet to visit a place that equals to Fika. It's in an adorable house, turned coffee shop.   The vibe is welcoming, the decor is minimal with plenty of natural light shining throughout the cafe. It's a little narrow but on my visit, there was just a handful of people so it was spacious! There are two rooms. The main room has the coffee bar and the second one has the book wall.   I had their cardamom latte, a recommendation with a savory scone. The cardamom latte was delicious! It had a little sweetness from the milk but there was flavor more than anything. It was served in a medium sized glass, not a mug which was different. The scone was balanced and different from the spice of my latte. It was crumbly, not too dense. I finished both with ease.   Pros: - Free Wifi - Free Parking (but limited) - In a great neighborhood to explore - Friendly service - Outdoor patio area  Cons: - Staircase to the restroom is narrow - Some chair aren't as sturdy  Tips: - Weekday mornings are less crowded - $5 minimum for card - They sell super cute Fika pins!  - They sell both coffee beans & loose leaf teas - They bake all their pastries!    One of my wishes, they open a location here in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"Used to love coming here -- but I guess they have changed their menu and added new staff, maybe under new management not sure. Food used to be some of our absolute favorite in the market.  Kind of rude, gave us the wrong order - and even wrong, the food was not good. Plain kale leaves, stale bread chunks, and a dried out, burnt egg sandwich.   Not a great experience..."}
{"text":"A little touch of Sweden on Kensington.  Bright, cozy. kid-friendly cafe.  We had a chocolate chip cookie and the lemon curd ice cream sandwich. Both were light and tasty. Good Illy cappucinos. We loved the Le Creuset mugs. Friendly staff.  They also have ginger snaps, macarrons and crossiants but didn't try them .. yet."}
{"text":"Pros: - The cafe itself is adorable - I love the white, airy decor and I especially love the wall of books! I also like the fact that there is a patio out in the back. Would love to eat out in the back when I come back here again.  - I really enjoyed the FIKA iced coffee. Very refreshing, especially with the added mint.  - For my second visit, I ordered the grilled chicken salad. They didn't have any grilled chicken at the time but they were willing to substitute the chicken with smoked salmon, which, in my opinion, is even better! - Very relaxing ambiance.   Cons: - It took a while for me to get my drink and it wasn't even that busy the last time I was there.   I would definitely be coming back again. If you're ever in Kensington and you need to take a break, I recommend stopping by FIKA for some iced coffee and pastries!"}
{"text":"So cute! We got the FIKA iced coffee, lavendar white hot chocolate, granola, breakfast sandwich, and vegetarian sandwich. They were all super delicious. The hot chocolate was the best!"}
{"text":"Very good coffee, sweets and ambiance over all. Highly recommend the combination of cardamom spiced latte with their cinnamon bun. The interactive wall makes for great insta pictures if you're into that.   I don't usually like Kensington Market, but this place really seems to weed out all the potheads and weirdos that are usually present at other locations in Kensington.   It has a unique design, coming very close to Swedish interior design. The food itself also resembles Swedish food very well, even though it is not the EXACT same.   I have multiple friends who just go there to grab a snack and study all day, which is even better during warmer days, when their backside patio is open. Prices are just a bit higher than Starbucks per se but the overall quality is worth it."}
{"text":"Since I discovered this lovely Cafe in Kensington I am a happy person. Starting with the place, I love the decor, very minimalist and pure, the walls are all white (but the wall that it's full of open books glued to it, which is so cool) everything it's always clean, upstairs, downstairs, the washroom, everything it's clean!  Their back  patio it's beautiful, very relaxing, perfect to take your friend and have a chat or get some inspiration and write or read a book, it's just lovely.  If you have to work on something this is also the place to do so, lots of small tables in the front  where you can work and a big table in the back as well.  My all time favourite it's the FIKA iced coffee, I love the taste of the cardamom bitters, very fresh and different. The magic bars are amazing, made with dark chocolate, coconut.   This is my favourite little coffee shop, I love kengsinton market and every time I'm in the are FIKA it's a must."}
{"text":"In terms of brunch, would forego this place. Between the FIKA breakfast and the eggs benny with salmon - no real standouts and not really worth it for the price. There are better places to spend your brunch money. But hey, if you're chillin' here and feel like getting some food to substantiate the baked goods yer havin' - go for it.  Otherwise, real cute cafe - front patio, couches in the main section, large communal table in the back + back patio (with a hammock!). Decor adds a nice ambiance. Feels like you're hanging out in a nice house full o' strangers, hah  DO TRY: I'd say FIKA's got a nice touch on their \"FIKA iced coffee\" - cardamom and mint are interesting ingredients to include. The coffee goes down real smoothly though, it's really more of an iced latte.    Raisin scones are served with fresh apple jam (love!) and are extremely fluffy. Not your usual bready texture so give 'em a try.   Also, eyeing the cinnamon buns - man, those look good."}
{"text":"Mmmmm cardamom iced mint coffee for the win! This was a lifesaver when we were navigating the heat on our Toronto vacation. I asked for my coffee slightly sweetened and it was perfect! I much prefer this mint iced coffee compare to the famed Philz mint mojito. This cardamom in the coffee wasn't overwhelming but gave it a slight spice that reminded me of a dirty chai.  My boyfriend wasn't a fan of his cold brew though. It came in a can poured into a cup with no ice so it warmed up pretty quickly.  The cafe itself is gorgeous and I'm glad we got to find it for an afternoon pick me up."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, instagram friendly and good food but EXTREMELY slow and annoying staff. Ordered the roast beef and horseradish sandwich with bean and kale salad, waited about 25 minutes with only one couple in front of me."}
{"text":"lovely place tried lemon ice cream sandwich ;)"}
{"text":"This place really belongs in Kensington. It has the feel of Kensington market: local, unpretentious, a bit hippie, but now in trendy white.  It's quite hard to get to if you were searching for it. I find this specific street in Kensington a bit hard compared to other streets because (by car) it can only be accessed in one direction from one street.  I really like the decor, seems relaxing. The service staff, they are super nice, pretty, offers a nice quick chat as they prepare you order and they are funny.  Came here for my Indie Coffee Passport drink and found they offered a Hot Latte with Cardamon and Mint, except the hot drink actually has no mint. They quickly let me know and it's cool with me. The drink itself was really relaxing because of the cardamon. It tastes just like the Indian rice pudding I had night before with cardamon.   They were just about to serve some free samples of their food before i left; too bad I was on my way. I think I'd come here again to get a drink when in the area."}
{"text":"I guess in the spirit of the Swedish concept of 'fika,' the folks of FIKA at Kensington Avenue went all-out to make this place feel homey. It's a starkly clean and bright, dramatic contrast compared to the grungy bohemian feel of the rest of Kensington Market--from the open kitchen to the famous wall of books, and even the backyard hammock, you feel like you're really in somebody's house (it's technically housed in a typically Toronto bay-and-gable house), or an IKEA catalogue page. Do I take off my shoes when I step inside?  It's a hip folksy minimalistic cafe straight outta a hipster folksy magazine with a variety of different Scandinavian-inspired spaces to fika. What I did not expect is weekend brunch service. Menu looks to be basic brunch fare (eg. eggs benny) priced at the mid-$teens (but smells damnnnnn good), but not here to eat. Despite so, every order is processed on a first-come-first-served basis at a pace slower than a Starbucks, so even a cup of tea takes bloody long to make. And maybe that gives you time to watch the cute (though feel kinda snobbish) hipster kitchen staff elegantly prepare brunch meals, or see what furniture and items in here are from Ikea (lol).  I did try their much raved to an hyperbolic high special iced coffee (which they refer to as the Fika iced coffee; $5) as i write this. The refreshing minty hints and mint garnish makes it feel more like drinking mojito. I can taste the excitement; it's a must try on a cool summer day as you let time fly on the hammock. Cool.  Some complaints include their policy of inexplicably disabling wifi access in their weekend brunch service hours (first time I have encountered public WiFi provided by Facebook for whatever reason), and my sister reporting staff indifference to a broken toilet I felt compelled to fix it myself.  With so many cozy spaces to pick from, Fika is fine for hanging out over a cup in their mix of spaces offering endless Instagram-friendly moments (see kids, in the old days we would call it 'Kodak moments'), for it's quite a chill place for being left alone or a civilized meet with a friend atmosphere-wise. The refreshing interior design novelty of the cafe, absolutely compared to most other indie coffee shops in Toronto that are hipster-heavy in reclaimed wood and exposed brick, seems to be the main draw here.  {TTC: Dundas streetcar to either Spadina or Augusta Aves}"}
{"text":"My friend never got her brownie and unfortunately realized this after leaving. I on the other hand, agreed on a discounted sandwich without the salad it comes with, yet they charged me full. Although my friend and I had a good conversation/time, this service is disappointing."}
{"text":"Quaint cafe perfect for grabbing a mid afternoon coffee and snack! The lemonade is delicious and so refreshing!"}
{"text":"Very delightful coffee shop, whose upscale decor betrays its location. You will find people hogging up tables with their laptops. A big communal table in the back. A patio with more tables, but doubtful it will be functional during the 9 winter months mother nature visits upon us.  I ordered a cafe latte. Nothing fancy to it. But it was so sweet and the pleasant milky taste masked I was drinking caffeine. I have found my favourite latte in the city.  My girlfriend ordered a lavender, hot chocolate milk made with almond milk. She also enjoyed her drink."}
{"text":"It is really cute cafe. Had earl grey latte was really good. The decoration is really cool. Probably will come here again."}
{"text":"Great decor and style, delicious drinks, and very nice breakfast sandwiches. Be sure to check out the lavender white hot chocolate--so good!"}
{"text":"My second time here and I love it. Atmosphere here is pretty laid back - great quaint cafe if you want to get some work done or for quick meetings. The almond butter avocado toast is a must try. Also recommend trying their potato salad."}
{"text":"Who's ready for a FIKA?!   FIKA as used in Sweden means \"having a break\", most often a coffee break (Wiki). And, let me tell you, FIKA is one of the cutest places to be for a coffee break! They turned a house into a coffee shop, but kept a house's charms. They have a patio in the backyard with a hammock for you to lie on with a friend/partner. It's decorated beautifully with a very homey feel. I loved how they put book pages on one wall. A very creative artistic piece. A word of caution, there is only one bathroom.  I ordered the ice coffee (their specialty). While, I found it a bit bland, it was still a unique drink. I think it would be good if they made the flavor stronger. I was there on a sunny Sat afternoon so it was quite busy. I had to wait about 5 minutes for my coffee. Wifi is turned on at 3:00pm on sat and sun as per the barista.   I will be back to try other items on their menu and to hang out!"}
{"text":"This is an adorable coffee house in Kensington! I had the Cardamom Spiced Latte which was perfectly lightly spiced with Cardamom. There's a really cute back patio as well as a front patio. The mint green color scheme is an attractive choice, although it is beginning to look a little worn. There's plenty of space inside for meeting or working"}
{"text":"Amazing cafe, incredibly cute and cozy with a open patio (the hammock at the back is major key). The Fika ice coffee is a must try!"}
{"text":"CUTEST CAFE EVER!!! Great location- right inside of Kensington. Their service was amazing, food was amazing, interior was amazing ! AHH Amazing !! LOL  I really enjoy their chic and modern vibe with the way they decorate their menu, and seatings.   they also have a bit of a common room with a big table where there's a wall full of book pages. I think it's for group study there.  P.S Also very insta worthy"}
{"text":"Small little cafe with limited seating. It seems like they transformed the first floor of a house into a cafe. The food here is pretty good and unique though there are limited options. Since it is a small shop, it can get crowded. If you're sitting in the front on cold days, you'll pray no one opens the door to let all the cold air in. Luckily, there is a small section in the back with a few seats. In this backroom, there is a cute little facade of old books with pages exposed. Great for photos."}
{"text":"Great little place! Starving for a brunch or late breakfast we stumbled in. I was also missing my morning coffee. Excellent Corrado. I had the flourless lavender brownie and it was very rich but went well with my coffee. My friend asked for a sandwich and they made it special for him, which was great! All in all I would definitely return, would love if they added more food though. :)"}
{"text":"Such a sweet and homey tea shop!   Immediately when you walk in the adorable interior will put a smile on your face. The shop is divided into three seating sections, one at the front (it's where I like to sit and study sometimes) and the back area and backyard. They serve a good variety of food, sweets, and tea/coffee, and my favorite thing to order there by far is their hibiscus tea which is absolutely heavenly and unique!   The only issue I've noticed is that it does get pretty crowded on certain times, I've come across occasions where I had to order my stuff and leave because it was so full, so keep that in mind when visiting FIKA! Overall amazing teashop with great service/food/ambiance."}
{"text":"The good: good coffee, great atmosphere, and super nice staff. I had the cappuccino my first time here, I would recommend it and try it again.   The bad: the hot chocolate here wasn't great :/ wasn't a fan. They unfortunately ran out of the lavender white hot chocolate, so I didn't get a chance to try that.  The ugly: nothing ugly here.  Neutral: there are settings for 2 at the front and at the back there is a huge table for bigger groups or those that don't mind sitting with strangers. Their baked stuff is pretty good. They now have the pilot cold brew if anyone is looking for that."}
{"text":"Free wifi!  Cool coffee spot in a cool neighborhood.  Clean bathrooms downstairs and friendly staff.  Awesome seating outside on a summer day.  Too bad it was hella cold when I was there."}
{"text":"Although there are already a ton of cafes in Kensington, Fika sets itself apart with the Swedish-influenced design and vibe. I could see myself easily spending a relaxed afternoon here reading. It's quiet and not too claustrophobic (compared to Moonbeam for example). The coffee is decent, but for a hot summer day, I definitely recommend the Fika iced coffee. It's flavoured with cardamom and fresh mint and tastes amazing!!   Other details make Fika special: fresh flowers at your table, picnic blankets, a serene back patio (complete with hammock), kid-friendliness (crayons and paper, a change table in the washroom)...   I haven't tried the food items yet, but they looked delicious (croissants, cookies, ice cream sandwiches). Prices run a bit high, but the quality of the experience is worth it."}
{"text":"Very cute cafe in Kensington, a nice place to rest after some aggressive thrift shopping. Decor was adorable - little flowers in tiny jars, minimalist design and muted, pastel colors. The interior was definitely very sleek, with the whitewashed walls and white on white tables, but in a very refreshing way.  They had a good assortment of pastries, but none of them really on display. And they had this awesome lemon egg tart.   Adorable, cozy cafe! Would love to spend a rainy day here with a cup of hot mocha."}
{"text":"Love their simple, clean and vibrant decor, I tried their Americano, meh.. but friends iced coffee was quite tasty. Great place to hang out with a friend."}
{"text":"Love the wall of open book pages. Didn't love how I couldn't get a seat to enjoy the view! This place looks so hipster, it hurts. I got the lavender infused white hot chocolate and it was great. I believe it's made in-house with vanilla bean, cardamom & steamed milk. It has a light floral flavour that's not overly sweet.   Definitely coming back to try their food and other drink items."}
{"text":"I come here for my lavender white chocolate.   The foam to creaminess consistency is just perfect!  Cute space and I really love their horse logo.   If only they had more seating space.  It can get super busy on a Saturday.   Darn, why can't a place this good have a spacious interior?  It's a bit cramped and probably is the only reason why I would just order the drinks to go.     Anyway, I can't wait till their patio opens up in the summer!"}
{"text":"Super cozy place with tasty coffee and nice people!"}
{"text":"I read about this place on NOW Magazine- what hooked me in was reading that they had lavender white hot chocolate! Sounds yummy!  My visit was on a Friday morning, so the place was quiet.   Service: Excellent- my lavender white hot chocolate($4) and a coconut granola bar($3) were brought to me.   Food: My lavender white hot chocolate was amazing! The scent of lavender reminded me of when I was in France. The drink was not as sugary and sweet as I thought, which I really liked. This is not one of those sugary hot chocolate that you buy from big-chain coffee stores.   The coconut granola bar was excellent- it was crunchy and smooth. It was very filling and it was not as sweet as other bars that you buy in a cafe.   I can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I love FIKA's outdoor back patio space. It is the ideal place to have a nice chit-chat with a friend.   Although what ruins it sometimes, is the loud boisterousness of others, totally out of the control of FIKA,  even if you were to tell the staff there, there is only so much they can do... And some people don't take it all that well, but what I have to say to them is BE CONSIDERATE of others that are there, by themselves or with some of their friends and can barely hear their friend sitting next to them, or themselves, think... I mean, c'mon respect is respect and I'm sure you'd appreciate the same!  The food was good. Although somewhere along the way my friend's order got mixed up and I must have not read the menu fully to know that the sandwich I ordered was open-faced, tartine style; that kind of disappointed me, but then again, what I had, came out to be the proper amount of bread. Especially with smoked salmon. Unless there is going to be A LOT of smoked salmon packed in there, one doesn't need a lot of bread because then the flavours (of the smoked salmon) will get lost.   The tartine I had was tasty, I didn't like the crème fraîche.... I personally thought it was far too thick and it didn't taste like the amaZing crème fraîche I know and love, I don't know what brand they use and that has an IMPACT. It also came with a side of kale salad. I LOVE kale... seriously one of my favourite veggies! Unfortunately, FIKA's recipe calls for extreme dousing of the kale in oil. Whether or not that is extra virgin olive oil or not was unclear to me.... I can't remember tasting it. EVOO has a distinct flavour and I don't recall. I understand that kale almost requires a finer pallet, or one that is more accustomed to the flavour, because not everyone loves kale, but when you pair something that is meant to be highly nutritional, with something that is not; however good the kind of oil is than it detracts from the point of consuming nutritious food.  I'd possibly go again, I mean the bread is by Blackbird's up the street and is excellent and FIKA changes their menu daily, so writing off this place because of one time seems unfair.   The cookies are from Splendido and I enjoyed my chocolate chip cookie immensely!   The service was polite and kind and unpretentious, which is always a good thing."}
{"text":"I visited pretty early in Fika's existence but it left me wanting to go back. The space is clean and uncluttered. Coffee was good and service was very friendly. Not a huge selection of tasty treats the day I visited which is probably a good thing. I've been eating far too much lately and it allowed me to make my trip about the coffee.  Washroom is down a narrow stairs but was super clean and quite cute. For some reason, they didn't have the patio furniture set up the day I visited but it's a great space for summer coffee and chats. Will return!"}
{"text":"3.5/5!  I love the simplistic, all white and airy decor of this place. The patio and front seatings are more for individuals who love to enjoy their brunch and quick coffee break. Whereas at the back there is a communal table, a chalkboard wall and a wall fill with book pages, very quite and comfortable. If you want to enjoy some nature and get away from the loud noises of the city, there is a private garden at the back with a hammock!  *FIKA only offer free wifi after 3PM and you have to ask the waitress for the password.  *Friendly and efficient services.  *They keep the space very clean.   -FIKA ICED COFFEE - $4.40:   Initially I didn't like it, as the mint and cardamom were quite an odd pairing with coffee, but I grew to love the flavor. The drink itself was very aromatic from the cardamom and not too sweet. I didn't think the mint was needed as the cardamom already added a spicy and herbal kick to the coffee.  -Scones:  I can't remember what type of scone this was, as they have different choices for the day. I remember having another scone with a raspberry jam and they were just the average scones.  On both occasions, the scones I got were cold, hard and very dense, however they weren't too sweet and went well with a cup of coffee.  -LAVENDER WHITE HOT CHOCOLATE - $4.00: The lavender white hot chocolate was another specialty of FIKA, and it wasn't my favourite as I find lavender is too strong and artificial. Also, white chocolate isn't chocolate lol, it's pure sugar so this drink is very sweet."}
{"text":"Delicious cappuccino (try the cardamom spiced version - it's amazing!), great ambiance, and tasty baked goods.  Pro tip: for those of us who are gluten-free, they usually have a cashew-butter based coconut and fruit bar that is sinfully delicious."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars! Today was my first FIKA experience, and although I just popped in to get a coffee and take a quick look around I left really impressed. I ordered an Americano and let's just say it might be my favourite in the city. I will wait until round three or four before I make that an official title.. Customer service was great and each employee I crossed paths with smiled at me which I always appreciate. Inside is beautiful and really well done, I look forward to coming back to enjoy more of the atmosphere. The cherry on top for me is that the logo is a unicorn... it warms my heart. Obviously some things never change."}
{"text":"Saw this as a suggestion for patios to check out and enjoy some rays. FIKA didn't disappoint. The set up is nicely laid out, and although not a big location, the seating is ample. There is a low hammock in the back which I suggest you try and get to before anyone else! I forgot I was in the Busy noisy city.  As for their food and drinks. I got an iced latte with almond milk. They don't have soy. I would suggest this or their special in-house spiced iced coffee with cardamom. It's summer in a cup!  Their poppyseed spinwheel cookie was delicious we got another one! Their vegan date and carrot muffin was also nice and tasty with the walnut crumble ontop; you could see how bright the orange of the carrot is so you know it's fresh!  FIKA in my language means stay, and this is one place you'll want to do that!"}
{"text":"Coffee house in a super charming building in Kensington Market.  Purchased their iced cardamom spiced coffee. It was sweet and the cardamom was the perfect addition.  I couldn't get over the aesthetics of this place - their book wall was beautiful and their outdoor patio/garden is super cozy.  Seemed like a calm house party with friends and everyone drinking coffee.  Friendly environment with friendly staff and great coffee!"}
{"text":"Such a cute and cozy cafe in the heart of Kensington! Too bad when I went there was no AC so it was helllaaaa stuffy! I had the BRIE + BLUEBERRY JAM GRILLED CHEESE and FIKA ICED COFFEE and they didn't quite hit the spot. The grilled cheese was a bit bland and just had a little bit of sweetness to it at most. I guess it was my first meal of the day so I was really craving for something flavourful so i don't blame them. The presentation was good though! The fika iced coffee was not that enjoyable to me either and i blame it on the cardamom bitters! My friend had the lavender white hot chocolate and that delishhhhhh! Having said that, if i was in the area, i still woudn't mind coming back for other items on the menu just cause this cafe is supahhh cute!"}
{"text":"A hidden coffee shop that would probably be one of the most unique places you'd go to. Came for coffee and got the iced coffee. All the food and coffee tasted good but I wouldn't call it extraordinary. Prices are average with 2 iced coffes and 1 latte totalling $14.  Go for: the very homely and unique decor, two patios in the summer (1 in front, 1 in rear)  Don't go for: full meals"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Fika if you're in the area! First of all, the interior is gorgeous. It's minimal and bright but cozy and cute as well. If I lived nearby, I would definitely be a regular customer.  My bf liked their Americano, and I had a seasonal rose lemonade type drink (I don't remember the exact name) which was delicious! Reminded me of a rose-infused mojito.  They offer pastries as well as small breakfast and lunch menus. They have outdoor seating in the front and the back."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend after lunch hoping to just sit around and digest our food. We sat down and got an Americano and a London fog. The drinks were pretty meh, but the lovely atmosphere makes up for it.  Overall I think Fika is definitely a good place to relax and catch up with a friend. I wouldn't suggest studying at Fika because the tables were too small and the place can probably seat only 15 people. Gotta say I loved their book covered wall, although it was packed so I didn't get to sit near it :("}
{"text":"I absolutely love this cafe! Their concept of hygge is adorable and a perfect haven on those gloomy Toronto winter days. My favourite dish was the open face smoke salmon sandwich on the lemon thyme ciabatta bread (this is one of the softest breads I've ever had!). Unfortunately they're taking that off the menu as they're making the menu totally in house and no longer getting supplies from previous vendors (which includes smoked salmon). Though I'm bummed I'm excited to see what their new menu has and what my new favourite dish will be!  As a work place this place has limited seating and can sometimes be crowded and noisy, but at certain times it's only occupied by other people working creating a perfect work/study environment."}
{"text":"Decent coffee and desserts. Nothing spectacular. Tables at the front of the cafe sit close together. More comfort and space are provided in the back. There's even a hammock, which is cool. It's the joint for hipsters. Cafe tends to close early."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  VIBE  What a lovely spot in Kensington Market! Though not a fan of the guy having a skype call in the back room while I'm trying to read. Common courtesy, people! I would like to see more sturdy chairs in the back room as opposed to the variety of neon lawn chairs but yes, it makes for an eclectic space. Staff are friendly.   I DRANK  It's all about the lavender, white hot chocolate. The flavours in this are delightful. A truly unique drink!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Fika is Swedish for break. I'd gladly take my breaks here when I'm in Kensington Market next. A nice addition to Kensington market. Can't wait until the front and back patios are open in the summer."}
{"text":"Fika is still one of my favourite cafes in Toronto. I can't help but appreciate the beauty of a clean and simple space. I had a wonderful cortado in the fall. We sat in the backyard on a bench. Most of the outdoor seating was put away. In the summer, people chill on the hammocks and read outside. It was quieter this time of the year. Students were studying in the backroom and people carried quiet conversations in the front. Everyone was very mindful of each other."}
{"text":"Cozy cafe with delightful treats! Try their cardamom latte and semlor (if you're in around April/shrove Tuesday)."}
{"text":"I have never actually dined here, but have hung out here a few times with friends. They have two great patios, and a hammock! I tried to get my boyfriend to swing in the hammock with me, but alas, I seem to be the only \"rebel\" in the relationship.   My friends have ordered their hot and cold coffees, and it was a hit and miss for them. For example, one friend ordered Fika's signature coffee, made with espresso, milk, cardamom bitters, simple syrup & fresh mint - which sounded delicious to me. But according to my friend, \"it was an interesting taste at the beginning - one that I thought I would like. But by the third sip, I was over it. The flavor combination did not do it for me.\" Those that ordered the less fancy coffees had no complaints. I also heard great things about their pastries, specially the bun (not sure if it is cinnamon, or another spice). And both times I was there, I noticed that most of their patrons were eating items from their food menu - lots of sandwiches covered their tables. So they must be good, right?!  If you find yourself in Kensington Market, and want to get away from the hustle and bustle, Fika is a great place to escape to."}
{"text":"I'm glad that I found a gem in Kensington Market! Their coffee was great and I love the ambience of this place. I'm going to this place whenever I am around this area :)"}
{"text":"After a stroll through other coffeeshops in Kensington Market, none had the unique offering of the cardamon spiced latte. My friend got a chai tea latte elsewhere and came back within the hour to get this. I'm not a fan of the spiced drinks so I asked if they could do a lavender latte since they offered a lavender hot chocolate - and they could! It was delightful. Very cute spot with the book covered wall in the work/study room, teacup display behind the coffee bar, and small fireplace."}
{"text":"I think I might have found my favourite cafe so far in Kensington Market. Fika Cafe is a Swedish-styled cafe that is all about minimalism. I am very drawn to simple and clean-styled cafes with a nice space and this place definitely hits the spot. I learnt that it was opened by the owner of Splendido, which is a contemporary Canadian restaurant near Harbord and Spadina. I think it's pretty cool to own a restaurant and a cafe.  The cafe has a nice back room with a large table for people to sit together and do work. I like how Fika Cafe has small tables in the front and a large one in the back to accommodate to the number of customers. The space is available for rent and since the owner is a photographer, there will be future crafting and tech workshops.  I quite enjoyed my Fika Cardamom Spiced Latte. It was a unique taste but it reminded me a bit of cinnamon as well. I wished I had the opportunity to try out their Lavender White Hot Chocolate because it sounded quite amazing.  I think I would like to come back here again when the weather is nicer and I'm around in Kensington Market. Oh! And the cafe's business card is way too cute. You can remove the pony from the card and Instagram the journeys of Dala, the Fika Pony, with #FikaKensington."}
{"text":"Fika is Swedish inspired coffee shop that sits among the busy and crowded streets of Kensington.  I would have figured it be a peaceful reprieve from the hippie crowd... annnd it wasn't.  Inside it is ridiculously busy with some seating but you'll find people just sitting nursing a drink for a table for 3 themselves. So for an actual hang out or coffee spot, it's not a great spot but it's probably the best in Kensington aside from Jimmy's.    So the space is quaint, small, and packed ... it has the most amazing wall in the back area.  There isnt a lot of spots around TO that makes an immediate 'ohhh wow' impact.  That wall of books would be one of them.  It's very cool.  We did find the service here quite chill, friendly (they smiled back!), and fairly quick especially considering the constant flow of people coming in for a coffee.  It's buzzing here.  They do offer a small collection of baked goods that run with the Swedish flavour preferences...  cardamom seeds, cinnamon sticks, orange peel, dried whole ginger root and whole cloves are normal spices they use and it's definitely represented in their baked goods here.  Flat White Almond Milk - Smooth and well balanced with the almond milk, this flat white was very well done & kudos to the barista for making clear lines on the design.  Not many baristas can do that with almond milk.  I did find they had more microfoam than just a minimal amount of fluffy foam on top which makes happy that these barista knows the difference.  A good cup to be had! 4/5  Cardamom Spiced Latte - I've had cardamom spiced coffee when I'm in Dubai and found it a nice compliment but with this particular cup, it was more enjoyable.  I detected another spice (cinnamon?) in addition to the sugar syrup to make a nice tempered sweetness that compliments the espresso.  It was a nice taste and a decent alternative to my favourite flavoured espresso drink Lover's Latte from Strange Love.  4/5  If you're in Kensington and dying for a good cup to go, I would recommend Fika as a solid choice.  It might not be a place to chill... not cause its a bad place necessarily but you'll find the tables hogged up by people oblivious to others and take up the entire 4 chairs by themselves & their bag."}
{"text":"This cute shop seems small initially but has a variety of cozy spaces to linger. Its hidden backyard (complete with a hammock) is best enjoyed during patio weather - it's a relaxing, breezy space shaded by large trees with comfy seats for lounging. I like that this cafe is more quiet and understated, both in its decor and its visitors. The drinks are good and reasonably priced ($2.50 for loose-leaf tea) considering I stay here for hours. I don't recommend the meals though as they are expensive for what you get.  Stopped by recently on a warm afternoon and they ran out of ice. Not cool!"}
{"text":"Cutest little coffee shop in the heart of Kensington market. Awesome location with a good amount of outdoor seating and lovely minimalist/hip decorations that make this a very relaxing place to sit for a quick bite or coffee. Take note: this generally seems like an awesome place to hunker down and get work done, but they do not provide free wifi between the months of May to October, presumably to keep crowds moving.    Be sure to try their signature Fika Iced Coffee - particularly in the summer - as it is very refreshing with cardamom and mint flavors. Great take on a classic. There are minimal food selections, but the Bacon Breakfast Sandwich I had was flavorful and tasty."}
{"text":"Love their cardamom iced coffee but it's really exp for the quantity you get :(  I do love their wall covered in books but it's always packed in that room so I've never had a chance to sit and read/work there  It's v busy especially on the weekends but cute cafe"}
{"text":"I'm just posting this to rave about their lavender white hot chocolate. It was absolutely delicious! It had hints of lavender and cardamom, and the white chocolate actually wasn't overpoweringly sweet. At first I was very skeptical of the cardamom but it turned out to be very subtle and added some interest to the drink. I definitely recommend it.   Their space is clean and minimalist. They have a couple small tables inside filled with people lounging around on laptops and some spots outside on the patio."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the laid back atmosphere, but wasn't a huge fan of the iced coffee. There was a bit too much lavender flavor for my taste. The barista was very nice and I did enjoy the bacon breakfast sandwich I ordered.  Although, there wasn't much consistency in the four sandwiches our group ordered.  If you are a big fan of lavender, go for the iced coffee...otherwise I'd stick to the latte or espresso"}
{"text":"Love this place. I had gone to the NYC location a few years and always wanted to go back, so I was pleasantly surprised to see a location in Toronto. This is a cozy Swedish cafe located near Kensington Market. It was quaint looking spot located in an old house. I tried the Cardamon Spice Latte and Lavender White Hot Chocolate and both lived up to my expectations and were amazing. Perfect blend of flavors in a cup."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with a very hipstery-homey feel. I absolutely love the decor. There isn't much seating, but the communal table in the back is good for quiet cafe dwellers while the front is more chat friendly.  I got the iced coffee which contains espresso, milk, cardamom and mint. As a former barista, I just want to clarify that this is not an iced coffee but an iced latte. The drink itself had a very strong cardamom flavour and was sweet, but not too sweet. The mint was literally a sprig of mint placed on top, so it was there but the flavour wasn't.  The lavender white hot chocolate is sweet with a mild lavender taste. At first, it does taste like soap for those who aren't familiar with lavender, but after a couple sips you get used to it.  I'd definitely recommend stopping by for the lavender white hot chocolate. It's just one of those things you gotta try at least once."}
{"text":"Simple White and Clean...  I came to Fika with no expectation. All I know was I suppose to try their Iced Coffee, namedd by One of the articles in Conde Neste's Traveler as the World's Best Iced Coffee. http://www.cntraveler.com/daily-traveler/2013/08/photos-toronto-canada-iced-coffee-sights_slideshow_item0_1  I was impressed... really impressed after my visit. I have to say the Iced Coffee is good, an excellent version with the addition of cardamom and mint. Great and light for the hot summer days...  But I was wowed by the patio! Seriously, a hammock at the corner in this private patio?! I was tempted to just jump on it and lay there and take a power nap.......   Splendido's modern Canadian kitchen team produces Fika's food which I need to come back for some healthy Scandinavian dessert and food."}
{"text":"Omg cannot believe this cafe uses Le creuset cups and plates!! The decor was awesome and so was my cappuccino"}
{"text":"A dramatic difference from the rest of kensington's warm, rustic feel, Fika is minimal, open, bright.. which isn't really my idea of a perfect cafe, but I can respect them for what they have created. I too was here for the indie coffee passport, and opted for the dark chocolate mocha. It was rich and creamy (full fat milk, but i swear he added some cream to get it that rich, yum) had a nice chocolate flavour, but it was lighter than I hoped when I ordered a \"dark chocolate\" mocha, and the balance of coffee to milk felt off.. was there really espresso in this drink?  Maybe I ordered the \"wrong\" drink, bit if you cant do it right, don't serve it."}
{"text":"Only been here once but this is definitely a hidden gem. It's quirky and hipster, and they have an amazing wall at the back to take pictures. It was cool that I did not come here looking for this wall, and it wasn't until after I went home to the U.S. that I realized this place is Insta-famous! The wall is decorated with books from floor to ceiling, with a farmhouse table in front - I LOVED that - I wish I could have that in my own house.  Then their other quirk is that they have a llama (?) as their mascot. I don't really get it but hey, maybe that's just the owner's thing. The name Fika is apparently Swedish for having coffee along with pastries. Now that is my kind of theme.   Their coffee also was awesome. Mine came with a mint leaf and it was something I had never tried before. It gave a freshness and a kick to the coffee and that is something I will venture more into in the future!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to try any of the food at FIKA, but the iced coffee itself was enough to warrant a review! Apparently Conde Nast magazine named their iced coffee one of the best, and I would agree wholeheartedly. Being a coffee lover, I'm pretty critical about how my coffee tastes, preferably a darker, less acidic roast. The iced coffee at FIKA comes with cardamom and mint, which adds another dimension of spice to the drink. I loved that they gave me the option of using almond milk with no extra charge as well! My only complaint is that the coffee taste could be stronger, which could be easily fixed with an extra shot or two. FIKA is the type of cafe that I love discovering when I'm traveling, and that iced coffee is going to be the standard to which I compare any other iced coffees to in the future!"}
{"text":"Their iced coffee is to die for. The cardamom and mint leaf takes this ice cold drink to another level. The atmosphere of the coffee shop is chill and tranquil with the endless seating throughout. Prop yourself on the front outdoor patio, side tables, community tables, or the rear outside garden oasis and stay awhile to enjoy the beverage of your choice."}
{"text":"Cute spot in Kensington. Great fresh food for brunch. A bit pricey for portions but overall really tasty."}
{"text":"The coffee here was good and there's free wifi that's easily accessible. However the space is very limited and there was a wait for seating. The tables are very small and not really great for studying. The washroom was also out of service which was very inconvenient at a coffee shop.   All in all, this place is good if you want to catch-up with a friend but bad if you're planning on doing some work/read/study."}
{"text":"I knew this place was hip and happenin' and surely it was. There's a patio out front, a lot of seating inside with the Instafamous wall. I didn't know there was a hammock so another visit is due.   I ordered the ice coffee. It was a little pricey at $5 but very very good. They pull the espresso right in front of you and then shake it with iced milk. You can switch to soy/lactose free/almond for an extra $0.50. The secret though is the mint sprig and cardamom. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place is such a cute little café. Definitely one of those \"Instagram worthy\" places, and I'm guilty of coming here for the pictures.  My girl friend had suggested we stopped by to see the infamous book wall - which was totally worth the mini photo shoot. This little place is in the heart of Kensington Market, so driving down and finding parking is a little annoying, but nothing out of the ordinary seeing as you're in downtown Toronto.   The seating is somewhat limited, definitely not a place to bring fifty people (it is a small café anyway). They serve coffee, pastries and lunch as well. Unfortunately I didn't get to try any of the food, but we did have one of their coffees, and I must say it was pretty good.  The \"backyard\" is adorable.  Some seating outside as well.  The people working there are SO incredibly friendly, it really makes you rethink how you are towards other people lol. We lost our parking pass outside by the hammock and didn't notice until about an hour and a half later when we tried to get our car, and one of the employees found it and kept it, knowing we'd end up coming back! How sweet!  Thank you for your honesty!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing place to have a cup of joe or lunch!"}
{"text":"What makes a house a home? Cardamom.   Fika is a mint green house turned cafe and restaurant on the main strip in Kensington Market. She is mint green brick and equal parts cozy and chic. I sipped one of their enjoyable designer lattés on their communal patio, it was a heavenly people-watching and cardamom-y experience.   I checked out the insides to use the facilities and came face-to-face with a breakfast sandwich I plan on returning for in the near future."}
{"text":"My Swedish roots loved everything about FIKA. It's a simple, clean coffee shop in the heart of Kensington Market selling northern European inspired coffee drinks like their cardamom latte (amazing!). They also sell a variety of pastries and light sandwiches. Log into their free wifi and stay awhile! There are plenty of seats for all."}
{"text":"I won't comment on the \"quality\" of coffee (I enjoy it!) because I am no connoisseur but I do know that I have not had a bad experience here. I've been 4-5 times now and I will note the following:  1. Food tastes great, is fresh and creative. (the salmon breakfast wrap on the weekends is my favourite) 2. The staff are super nice. 3. The back patio feels like an escape from the city. 4. Little hints of Sweden are a nice touch.  My favourite cafe in the city (other ones I like/tried: Le Neuf and Jimmy's)"}
