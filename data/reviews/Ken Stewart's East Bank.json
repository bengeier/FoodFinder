{"text":"Stopped in around 8 on a Friday night with 2 friends.  No problem getting a table.  Service was excellent!  We were actually greeted by Ken Stewart at the door.  Steak was perfect.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed! Ken Stewarts in Fairlawn is a favorite of mine. I was so excited when I found out that he was opening a store in Cleveland. I've been there now at least five times. My first visit was outstanding. My friend and I had drinks at the bar and share the cold seafood tower. Unfortunately, it's been all downhill since then. Approximately one month ago when I was there I ordered a medium rare steak that came to me medium well-ish. I made the mistake of not saying anything to the server and it went away disappointed. 

On my last visit on Thursday night, the disappointment never ended. It started with my waiter's reply to me when I asked if they had Skyy vodka, saying that's a lower end vodka, I don't think we have it. Needless to say, I didn't know being insulted was part of my dinner experience. I tend to drink what I prefer, not what a magazine say is in. Comically, they did have it and it was a top shelf price. 

I then ordered the macadamia nut crusted tuna. This dish was one of my favorites at the Fairlawn store. I ordered it medium rare and it essentially came to me raw with the top being burnt. I'm guessing they used a torch to attempt to brown, yet blacken, the nuts on the top. No part of my tuna was warm. I did send this back and it came back to me medium well with very little pink left.

I will say that the manager very graciously attempted to give me another dish, but I was so irritated by this time it was time to go.

Not sure I'll be back. There is a time when you cut your losses and realize enough is enough. What a disappointment. 

I love the view, location, and the Decor, but the waitstaff is arrogant and when it comes down to it, it really is all about the food."}
{"text":"5 stars for service, food, cocktails, and ambiance. Great view of the flats from the bar and dining room. Ken and  Lori are the nicest owners. They made us feel like we were part of their family.......Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow. Ken has done it again, it's about time he took his talents up to Cleveland. From the ambience, to the food, to the drinks, and the amazing staff this is an all around five star restaurant, you really feel like you're dining in New York City or Los Angeles. The food speaks for itself, everything from the taste to the presentation and textures, over the top amazing. Must try the tuna tartar appetizer and the Waygu beef entree, some of the best cut of meat I've ever tasted. And they even have live music once a week I believe! So happy to see this revitalization of the flats with this iconic northeastern Ohio restauranteur."}
{"text":"This was a great experience! Great food, great wine pairing, great sides just an all around pleasant dinner.  
The waitress, while very attentive, was nervous, maybe new, nevertheless, she had great backup and overall did a great job taking care of us. 
Prices were comparable to other \"nice\" restaurants. We enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"The most consistently amazing restaurant in Cleveland! Their salmon is always on point and their oysters are to die for! Service is impeccable .. I would go every day if I could!"}
{"text":"I have been to every Ken Stewart restaurant when I lived in the Akron area. I was quite happy to hear that the Ken Stewart's East Bank was open and in the downtown area.

The server was great, explaining every part of the menu, letting us ask questions, and did not rush us considering this was our first time. Their meat selections looked amazing, but we decided with the mussels as an app, Wild Salmon and the Tuna.

I really enjoyed all three of the plates. My Tuna was cooked perfectly and the Salmon was full of flavor. Our server was attentive but not overbearing, making sure we had plenty of water and our cocktails were replenished. 

The inside of the restaurant/bar has a great atmosphere and modern decor. However, this location seems so odd until the rest of the Flats starts to regain some momentum. Looking out the window you see the dirt, port-a-potty's and the parking lot.

I know one day this will be a key location but I would recommend blinds or curtains of some sort to make the view outside not visible until it is cleaned up better.

And upon entering it had that \" new\" smell of clean carpet, paint etc... Not the best aroma when eating fish. Again, I could have just been there after they did a wall touch up or severe clean so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.

When the area develops a bit more I'm sure I will be there again."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today, the restaurant has been open for a few weeks at this point. Lunch was in the $10-$20 range, generally, and offered a variety of sandwich and salad options. They had a number of vegetarian and vegan options, which was excellent. There were some larger plates in the $20-$40 range, but seemed too heavy for midday. We were in a rush so we didn't have time for appetizers, but there were several I was interested in trying from the small plates menu. 

I had a chicken club which included a fried egg, bacon, field greens, and flattened chicken breast. It was topped with some sort of aioli and served on grilled bread. The bread was really light, but so light that it was difficult to eat, so I had to cut the sandwich halves into quarters. Not a huge deal. The bread was pretty greasy, which didn't help. The andwiches came with a side of fries. Other orders at my table were Cobb salad, hummus (small plate), wedge salad, and turkey sandwich.... Everyone seemed pretty happy with their meals. The wedge salad was huge, and I was pretty envious of it when our food arrived. The restaurant had an interesting take on the Cobb, too.

The decor was great, and since we were there at lunch, it was very bright from the large windows that line the front of the restaurant. The view wasn't great, but hopefully it will get better as the area gets built up.

The waitstaff seemed to be still getting into their groove, bless their hearts. i.e. the waitress tried to upsell their fruity specialty tea, but I asked for a black tea, and she didn't know what I was talking about so I just got water. Really? You don't know if you have a brewed black tea? We were their at lunch rush, so it took a few minutes to get our order, and the hostess tried to take our menus before the waitress returned with our drinks. It seemed like alot of it was figuring out the rhythm of working with other people, and there was nothing really egregious, they just need to work out some kinks. I'll definitely go back, I'm dying to try the turkey sandwich.."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting Ken Stewart resturant in Downtown Cleveland Ohio East Bank of Flats on Friday 03/14/14..... The experience was amazing...... from the moment you walk in you are caught up in this unique ambiance.... From the bar to the booth..... The food was absolutely deelish......I had the mussels and the burger.... Simply mouthwatering..... I ordered to what I now know was the last batch of mussels and I'm so glad...... since I'm not a big beef eater why not try the burger.... So glad I did... ..I do recommend!!!  The malbec wine was just what my palate of taste buds needed.... Order a glass you won't be disappointed...... . on top of that Ken Stewart himself stop by our table to ask how we were enjoying our food and to introduce himself..... When I asked for more bread be said let me get it for you......what a first impression the owner..... Also working. .... I met one of his daughters who was working the hostess stand.... Very pleasant like her dad...... I can't forget our waiter Josh and I didn't get the bartender name who put the order in for the mussels as it was their last one!!! But I'll be sure to get his name next time......I highly recommend you won't be disappointed no way no how.... Way to go Ken!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. We made a reservation a month in advance for a large group and the restaurant called two hours prior to confirm and then an INCOMPETENT manager called back five minutes later to cancel us. Never did anyone apologize or give a reason why. If only you could give negative stars, that is what this waste of space truly deserves. Hopefully something better and more professionally managed takes it's place soon! If you want a great meal and/or drinks check out The Wileyville or Lago just next door, we sure are glad we did!"}
{"text":"Everything was great.  Small and intimate dining spaces.  Not too loud.  Great, attentive staff.  Apps, salads, entree, and desserts all excellent.  Menu is nicely varied too.  Not just a steak house.  Great for special occasion."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED AND PRETENTIOUS SERVICE.  We popped in to this establishment while we were downtown after an early evening show.  Initially we really liked the buzz of the restaurant as well as the atmosphere but once we sat down and were greeted by our server Marcus, everything went downhill from there.  He was not friendly or personable at all and once we made it clear that we didn't want to order the 145 dollar steaks he actually seemed rude.  The food we did order was very good as well as the crafted cocktails, but for a high check like this, I would expect Ken to be a bit more selective about the servers he employs.  No one wants to go out and spend hundreds of dollars only to be waited on by a snobby server who only caters to those willing to spend hundreds of dollars on an entree.  This place is trying way too hard, and it shows... just provide good food and service, the rest will follow.  I really have to wonder why they charge these prices for food and bottled  wine.  Do people actually think their food tastes better because they paid way too much for it?  Again: trying way too hard guys."}
{"text":"Just about as good as it gets. Yes others have mentioned it has some high prices-but you do get what you pay for. Went with a group of 6 - we all had different entrees and not one complaint. The ambiance is  extraordinary for Cleveland. The place just has some nice touches. The owner stopped to check in with us during ours dinner, which I thought was good business.  This won't be your every night  hang out. But when you want something extraordinary you should try it."}
{"text":"Attended Ken Stewarts with a group of three couples. Others I had spoken with had really built up their Ken Stewart's experience in Akron, so I was prepared to be blown over. I wasn't. My Ken Stewart's experience was similar to one had at Flemings. Not saying it was a bad thing but I wished I tempered my expectations of \"best steak I'll ever have.\" The table split a bunch of apps and side dishes. The calamari and mussels were great. The creamed spinach was fantastic, the Brussels sprouts and garlic mashed were good, and the grilled asparagus was all right. Most of the group got the East Bank Mixed Grill and all thought it was wonderful. In hindsight, I really wish I followed suit. Another at the table got a special of quinoa incrusted scallops and was not overly impressed, saying the scallops seemed over cooked. I ordered a bone in rib eye, medium with added shrimp. The steak was a beautiful cut of meat, with a great sear with two little shrimp on top. Now I wasn't expecting a mountain of shrimp added to my plate, but two 26-30 size shrimp for $10 was a disappointment.  Unfortunately, they also weren't very good. They tasted bland and were a bit cold. The ribeye was unfortunately cooked rare, not medium rare, but rare. I have no problem eating a rare cooked steak but my wife had looked forward to trying a piece or three and wouldn't try it as I had asked for medium. The steak was good, but not great. It didn't set itself apart.


The service was top notch. The server, Erica, stood out from the experience. She was on the ball, accommodating and had a personality. She was not the normal fine dining server with a robotic demeanor and killing you with kindness.  The location is in a growing community, in a few years it may be great. Currently you look out the window at RTA tracks and a developing frame of a building. The best way for me to describe my overall experience is to say Ken Stewarts won't be put in my dining rotation, but I won't say no if someone wants to have dinner there."}
{"text":"Ken Stewart's East Bank is located in the revitalized section of the Flats. It is the cornerstone of the aLoft hotel and Ernst and Young building. 

When you walk in you are greeted to a decor that is something I would expect from New York, Chicago or Los Angelas. Very chic and contemporary yet warm with lighting and music. The attention to detail is unparalleled in Cleveland, even in the bathrooms. The men's room even has a big screen TV and I understand the ladies room has make up mirrors with the \"perfect\" lighting. (Not sure what that means lol)

The next thing that I find amazing is the staff. They always make you feel special and they are truly glad that you're there. Lyndsey Stewart the GM (Ken's daughter) is amazing. She always greets me with a smile and a hug and genuinely cares about your experience. Most of the nights you will see Ken and his wife shaking hands and making jokes. 

The food... the menu is so different than anything around. I would describe it as American fusion. With steaks, fish, crab, lobster, and vegan options (The Lobster pot pie is AMAZING). I have had almost everything and it is always of the highest quality. I will not say that every meal was perfect but when it wasn't they addressed it on the spot. 

I normally sit at the bar and interact with the locals and travelers staying at the hotel and I feel like the bartenders do an amazing job of making everyone feel welcome. They are extremely knowledgeable and seasoned professionals. You have to try one of the Moscow Mules (in the copper mugs of course). I am always struck by the selection of the massive bar which looks to have close to 600 bottles on the shelves in front of you.

Once your dinner is complete I would recommend going up to the main lobby of the hotel and check out WXYZ the bar in the main lobby. The bar manager Justin is ridiculous and makes the most amazing martinis. Everything from traditional, dirty all the way to Reese's Peanut butter martinis. The guy's a star!"}
{"text":"If half stars were available, I'd probably jump this up to a 2.5, but that's about as high as I can go. 

The short version of the review is that there are a lot (a LOT) of amazing restaurants in Cleveland where you can get amazing food and an amazing experience and this place just isn't cutting it. 

Longer version: I can't tell of they have high prices just to seem exclusive and build up a reputation, but the dining experience we had doesn't justify the price tag. 

The service was fine, but certainly not fine dining quality. Frankly, it took away from the experience and made the high price plain insulting. Of three diners each getting a drink, appetizer, main and dessert, only one entree and one dessert was deemed really good. Everything else was burnt, underseasoned, bland, misrepresented or otherwise disappointing. 

Thankfully, there are dozens of other restaurants in town that really know how to provide a diner with a positive experience."}
{"text":"This is an upscale and pricy restaurant, but the \"$$\" rating (indicting \"Moderate, $11-$30\" including meal, tax and tip) is way off.  Our group of 6 had appetizer, entree and some shared dessert.  Yes, we had maybe 2 glasses of wine per person, not 1, but we ordered the house wine (Ken Stewart label).  We were modest on selection of entrees, with one 12 oz fillet but otherwise selections in the lower price range.  Total bill including tax and tip was just shy of $100 per person.  $11-$30 would certain not buy a dinner of any sort here!

The ambiance and situation are pleasant and fresh and the food is good, but I have had many more memorable meals in Cleveland / Tremont / Ohio City for far less.  Very over-priced for the result, in my view, and my guests all thought likewise.  A nice place to go if someone else is picking up the tab and doesn't care about cost. Otherwise look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I brought my office here for dinner. The service was poor.  The Greg Norman Wyagu was grizzled and inappropriate to serve.  Overall, a very disappointing meal.  And then they added a presumptuous 20% gratuity onto the tab.  This is my last visit to KSEB."}
{"text":"Very good.  I made a last minute Open Table reservation and they were ready when we got there.  We were seated outside on a very warm, pleasant  night. The service was prompt, and both the food and drinks were excellent.  Overall, the menu seemed pretty pricey, even for its location. But, you often get what you pay for, and everything was better than average.  The only downside to sitting outside was the noise from the trains going by constantly - only about 50 feet away.  I have to give the service five stars. We weren't exceptionally hungry so we split an appetizer and an entrée, and they split both plates for us at no additional cost.  I would definitely consider going back again."}
{"text":"First time dinning and had reservations for my wife's birthday...great food ( a bit pricey) for the quality of steak..great atmosphere and a very attentive service..we def be back."}
{"text":"This was our final stop last evening as our small group explored the new East Bank. We enjoyed a great bottle of pinot noir and a couple of snacks off the late night menu, the cheese plate and the truffle fries.  Everything we consumed was fantastic, but what really launched Ken Stewart's above the other two restaurants in the Aloft complex was the incredible service and cozy atmosphere.  We sat in a living room style couch area in the bar, and were attended by a waiter who exuded that confident, knowledgeable, but friendly and conversational air unique to truly fine dining establishments. It was an excellent, luxurious end to the evening, and will certainly be where we begin next time."}
{"text":"It was a busy Saturday night. I was greeted several times by staff performing various roles. My order arrived timely and as requested. When asked did I enjoy my meal, I mentioned everything was delicious except one part of my entree was over done and it was received from the bill proactively.  Overall great dinner just be prepared for the bill lol!"}
{"text":"Nice vibe. Tasty steak and appetizers. 
Would definitely come again next time I'm in town for business. Have to try the bone-in RibEye, which one of the bartenders gave me and my friend a couple of pieces to try. It literally melted in my mouth. Some of the best meat I've ever had.
The mussels w/curry and cilantro, peppers were delicious as was the tuna tartare. My friend and I both had the steak salad which was served on a small plate; not so great but ok. Nothing special. Overall food was yummy. Would rate it 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great Service, but food is over priced and not really that good. 10$ for fries with Parmesan cheese covered yuck, was way to much. Better off going elsewhere for the money you pay."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that is billed to be \"high end\" - this truly disappoints.  

The atmosphere is inviting.  You are greeted quickly and kindly as the hostess offers to take your coats.  We were walked over to a cozy table nestled into a corner that gave us a great view of the restaurant and the kitchen.  I loved being able to watch the team of chefs prepare the meals, and I also loved that the tables weren't packed in too tight.  

The staff was great.  Kind, warm and efficient; we had no problems with our service.

The food however, was another story.

Disclaimer - we came here for restaurant week.  We look forward to RW every year and use it as an avenue to check out multiple restaurants as a reasonable price.  For those not hip to the RW scene, each diner pays $30 - at Ken Stewarts we each got an appetizer, entree, and dessert from a limited menu.  I did include prices off the menu - unsure if the size of the entree remains the same.

The waitress brought us over a pan of complimentary fresh baked rolls... the problem was that they were rushing to bring them out and therefore did not give the rolls time to fully cook.  The middle of the rolls were a gluey, gummy, mess.

The boy started off with a Sazerac ($12).  It is his \"drink of choice\" and we often use it to determine the skill of the bartender.  This Sazerac was spot on.  If you're not familiar with it - it's a more labor intensive cocktail that requires a delicate balance of ingredients.  A little too much of this or that and you end up with a disgusting, overwhelming, mess of a drink... trust us... we know from personal efforts to perfect our home version.  We highly recommend their artfully prepared cocktails after this drink.  

For appetizers we tried their crispy calamari served with spicy vinegar ($14), and truffle fries ($11).  The calamari was okay... it didn't \"sing\".  There was nothing truly special about it.  Enjoyable but not great.  The fries were hit and miss... when we had the full balance of truffle oil, fry and other goodness they were tasty.  But some of them were not as well seasoned.  I would not order either of these for an appetizer again in the future as they weren't truly special.

Our entrees were a little bit more promising.  The scallops with sweet potato puree, brussel sprouts, crisp gaufrettes and pomegranate molasses were good, but again, nothing extraordinary.  For a $38 price tag I expected a bit more.  We have had much better scallops at other local restaurants for a better price.   There is nothing \"wrong\" with this dish, but we think it was far from incredible.

I tried the Wagyu & Wild boar meatloaf with sweet potato risotto, and roast tomato-soy barbecue sauce ($28).  I had high hopes for this item... I kept coming back to this menu item and eventually decided that I had to try it.  The meatloaf itself was okay, but it was smothered in a spicy barbecue sauce that was off putting... I ended up only eating one bite.  I did enjoy the sweet potato risotto, the flavors were mild but the rice was cooked well.

For dessert we tried the peanut butter bomb and the chocolate tiramisu.  Neither of the desserts were very good, and we ended up leaving most of it on the plates.  The peanut butter bomb was similar to warm chunky peanut cookie that was cooked in a ramekin and topped with a bit of ice cream.  It was overly sweet and had a texture that I didn't care for.  The chocolate tiramisu also left something to be desired... I would have loved it to have more flavor, especially raspberry.  

Overall... I would pass on this in the future, even at RW prices.  The food is decent, but not exceptional.  And for the price - it should wow."}
{"text":"I went to Ken Stewart's Saturday and was completely impressed. We had a 6 top, and I was dining with some finicky people, and Ken Stewart's didn't miss a beat.  The decor is nautical and edgy at the same time. The service is very good as well. Three people at my table ordered the ribeye with two huge scallops on top. I tasted the steak and it was delicious and cooked to perfection - medium. I ordered the Dover sole, that was prepared meuniere style. The server said that it would be deboned at the table which it wasn't. Another elderly  diner at the table ordered it and couldn't eat because it was filled with bones. The GM came to the table and attempted to debone it, but it was impossible without making a mess. The fish was delicious, bones and all. One person ordered the Sea Bass, it looked a little dry and it's an extremly small portion. DO NOT order the Sea Bass if you're starving, it will not be enough. The tiramisu is very good, and has a salted carmel taste to it. The cassata cake was tasty, but a little dry. All in all, it was a great experience.

Even though they don't have a dress code, I would adhere to the following:
Men, wear a jacket
No flip flops and t-shirt
Dressy jeans
-smart casual or casual elegance"}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience at Ken Stewart's east Bank last night along with my wife,daughter and son-in-law. I say experience because it all came together in terms of atmosphere,food,service and friendliness. 

We started with lobster bisque, crab cakes and the tuna sashimi. We would recommend each dish. The bisque has a deep lobster stock flavor,something usually missing. Crab cakes were prepared from Alaskan King Crab which was a different take on Maryland style but it worked well. The tuna was delicious . Even my wife ,a non-sashimi person, enjoyed it.

We then went to mains including the meatloaf, steak sampler, seared tune and the burger. Each was very good. The meatloaf was probably the best my wife has eaten. Ask for the barbecue sauce on the side. It's great but a little goes a long way. Son-in - law loved the four different types of steak on the generous sized sampler plate. They ranged from dry to wet aged versions of Japanese beef. Really good! My daughters seared tuna was excellent. The burger also very good.



The topper is the friendly service in a very cool atmosphere. Charles waited  on us with friendly service and very clear explanations of the food. Ken also was there and stopped and checked on us several times. 

While prices are on the higher end this place is worth it and is recommended . Check out the bar as well."}
{"text":"Had a business meeting lunch on a Wednesday at noon.  First off,  I was pretty devastated by the underwhelming atmosphere.  I was really hoping the east bank project would finally be something to brag about in Cleveland.  None the less they managed to miss the mark once again.  What really kills me is that we get seated front and center behind a gorgeous floor to ceiling window that looks out at a slightly elevated train track running the RTA along with a construction site.  Really?  We parked literally on the other side of the building where there is a stunning view of the lake and would have been better off ordering are food to go and eating in our cars.  In short, no lake, no river, just construction, shocker.

The service was attentive but not overwhelming.  Overall service gets an A.

French onion soup was standard, above average quality ingredients.  Wagu burger trio sliders were way overdone.  I mean down right crispy.  The presentation was slick, picture worthy perhaps.  Overall food was disappointing given the price.

I don't see any reason to go back for lunch."}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had.  Cooked to perfection with amazing outer crust. Ken Stuart greeted the table and could not be more appreciative of our business.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night snack and received superb service. Crab cake and champagne, Yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ken Stewart must be the Comeback Kid of modern day Cleveland.

I initially hesitated going here because I've been to the Ken Stewart's locations in Akron and they are such a disappointment that I had little hope that things would suddenly change if he opened a location farther away from home. After several friends had a positive experience, I decided to take the plunge.

I decided to check out brunch. I was impressed beyond my wildest imagination.

The interior design is great. There is a small bar which is well stocked. Whether you want a glass of wine or a cocktail, they will do it well. We had two different dishes and both were excellent. I suspect that everything on the menu will be as well executed. I anticipate that this will quickly become the restaurant of choice for business dinners in Cleveland.

Here's hoping that some of the learnings here will return to Akron and create a renaissance in that city."}
{"text":"I love this place! Ambiance is really cool and laid back. Staff is so very attentive.  Took my Mother for her birthday Saturday and Marc, our server was pretty spot on! But then, he was at XO Prime, what what did I expect!
Megan, the bartender, knows the gift of \"shaken not stirred\" but then I met her at Hype Park Beachwood years ago! So she's learned all she needs to know to deliver a Devine cocktail. 

We had a nice table where as the sun set, the warmth beamed in the room.  It was a cool enough evening that you could sit outside and sip a crafted cocktail.

Make Reservations, however and if you want a certain table, better state it! I made them about 3wks in advance and my table choice could not be accommodated. 

Quite pricey, but delicioso!  A little more crab and lobster in my Pasta dish next time, Chef.. It was a little slim."}
{"text":"First the steak was overdone and then they cooked it again and it was frozen and they cooked it again and it was burned on the outside. The owner's daughter thought making the steak free was the answer opposed to having the steak cooked correctly! #mediumwell. BUT they make good fish . So # good atmosphere but bad service. #kenstewarts #kenstewatscleveland
My recommendation is that you go to Red Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Just had a damn near perfect dinner last night at Ken Stewart's new place. Having grown up in Akron and celebrating all major life events at Ken Stewart's Grille, and making semi-frequent forays out to the Lodge and Tre Belle, I'm familiar with Ken's oeuvre. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area now and have dined at some of the best restaurants around. East Bank can hang with them. 

The decor is upscale with a \"Cleveland maritime\" feel and a gorgeous bar. The service was enthusiastic and personable and the pace was just right. As far as the food goes, I went for a lighter seafood dinner to pair with a dynamite Meursault. Oysters on the half-shell, Chilean seabass and a side of creamed spinach. The seabass in particular was exquisite. I finished with a sea salt caramel ice cream, which the server told us was from Jeni's, a local favorite. That, paired with a Chateau d'Yquem, was lights out. 

My only issue is with the pricing. Kind of over the top. Even without the French wines, you're going to pay a lot here. I don't think he could get away with it in SF. But since there might not be anything on this level in Northeast Ohio, perhaps it's worth it."}
{"text":"Wow - what a surprise! Had not anticipated my dinner to be that delicious and the ambiance that appealing. My Niçoise salad was excellent - the tuna seared to perfection. And it's rare that I comment on the bread, but I have to now - the bread is lightly coated in butter with a bit of sea salt ... melts in your mouth. I was seated by the fireplace, ideal on this cold, windy evening, esp after long day at work. And I only landed here because my hotel is in the se building - lucky me!"}
{"text":"A two-star review for Ken Stewart's East Bank may seem harsh, but given the price tag for what may very well be the current most expensive restaurant in Cleveland, the sub-par grade is more than justifiable.  I gave Ken Stewart's a chance to reach for the stars, getting the \"True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef from Kagoshima, Japan.\"  (With that many guarantees of authenticity in the title, how could you go wrong?)  I've only had imported steak from Japan once before, at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Prime in the Bellagio Las Vegas, and it remains one of my fondest steak memories to date.  Ken Stewart's failed to provide even a shadow of that previous wagyu experience:  While the fat content is there, the marbling was not nearly as evenly spread throughout the cut.  And instead of that unreal feeling of the dispersed fat melting on your tongue, you're left with just sad, thinly-sliced cross-sections of fairly fatty but rather unremarkable meat.  Similarly disappointing, while the menu lists a lobster add-on for $20, the server politely explained that the add-on was simply some cut-up chunks of lobster put on the plate, but a lobster tail add-on was available for $40.  I would strongly discourage any future diners from taking up this offer--the tail came out overcooked, destroying any of the delicate sweetness of the lobster meat.  On top of that, the tail was served without any clarified butter, a pretty glaring omission for a high-end restaurant.

What makes the Ken Stewart's experience even more egregious is that less than two weeks later I visited the new downtown Red location ordering many of the same things (substituting a USDA Prime aged ribeye for the Kogashima wagyu).  In every respect, with every dish, Red was superior--particularly with the larger, tastier, and substantially more reasonably-priced poached lobster tail add-on--at what amounted to two-thirds of the price of Ken Stewart's."}
{"text":"Had some dear relatives in the CLE  last weekend and decided on visiting the Cleveland version of Ken Stewart's famous Akron restaurants. Really enjoyed the \"industrial/modern/freighter design of the restaurant. Very cool use of indoor/outdoor fire pits, lighting and window views that will only get better when the East Bank of the Flats returns to its glory in the next few years .Our server couldn't have been better. You appreciate impeccable timing when dining as a group. World class- Stuffed banana pepper appetizer, the small filet mignon and the sea bass. Had better-20 oz bone-in ribeye and edamame hummus app. Don't let the latter stop you. a great dinner awaits and the opportunity to have Ken and his beautiful wife (who happens to design the restaurants) stop by."}
{"text":"I went to Ken Stewart's last weekend for dinner with my parents. I was impressed with the location, and like that this new construction is revitalizing the area.

The interior of the restaurant is sleek and modern, with a cool \"downtown loft\" ambience. The restaurant itself was beautiful and clean, and they even offered mouthwash in the bathroom. The service here is good: our waiter was very polite, friendly, and knowledgable about the food. He was also more than willing to answer questions and make recommendations.

My main disappointment with Ken Stewart's is the mismatch between the premium food prices and the average quality dishes. Let me explain:

When we received the menu, I was initially struck by how expensive everything on the menu was. This restaurant has one of the highest price points I've seen in Cleveland! For example, the entrees were generally between $35 and $50, with the highest price being $145! With prices like that, you would expect the food to be both outstanding and flawless. However, in my experience, this was not so. As an appetizer, we shared an order of fried calamari and edamame hummus. Both were tasty, nothing special. They offered us house-made dinner rolls, which were again average. 

Then we got our entrees. The three of us ordered fish dishes. When they came out, we could tell that our fish was definitely fresh. But there were notable problems with the execution of the dishes. I ordered seared tuna, rare. My tuna was a bit overcooked, probably about medium. It was served on top of edamame rice, which was average. But this dish had a huge problem: it was covered with quite a large amount of miso paste as well as a miso-soy reduction, both of which were incredibly salty! Of course I understand that a person's salt tolerance varies; however, this was at an inedible level! This seems like an egregious error for any dish, and especially one that costs $43! I wiped it off and continued eating. Besides this, my mother ordered the bronzino, which was a bit overcooked and crumbly, but tasted pretty good. My father ordered the whole yellowtail snapper, which was the best dish of the night. It was very fresh and lightly fried. It was laying in ponzu sauce, which my father found to be on the salty side too (but was nothing compared to the tuna!). Again, neither of these two dishes were above average in creativity or taste, which is disappointing for dishes that costed $38 and $42. Lastly, we ordered a side of truffle fries to share. The fries had a nice crispy texture, but they were so overly greasy that we could not eat them. I suspect that they either didn't drain the fries, or poured an excessive amount of truffle oil on top. Whatever it was, our basket returned looking like it hadn't been touched.

If the prices here weren't so high, maybe I wouldn't have been so bothered by those errors, and maybe my hopes for outstanding food would not have been so elevated. I resist comparing cities, but having lived in Chicago for four years, I found prices that high only in Micheline-stared restaurants, so I was expecting more from Ken Stewart.

That being said, I really hope that was an \"off\" night, and I would be willing to give it another try.

My conclusion is that Ken Stewart should lower its price point or improve its food quality so that it can become a Cleveland standout!"}
{"text":"I've been blessed to date chefs that's travel the world and also I live in VEGAS so I am blessed to eat food at some restaurants with the best chefs in the world .... Let me tell you this .... BEST WEDGE SALAD of my life and BEST CRAB CAKES EVER!!!!!  Sat at bar to watch cooks do their thing and Ken himself came and sat with us!!!! AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We went to Ken Stewart's East Bank for Downtown Cleveland restaurant week since my dad was in town visiting.  We both ordered off the Restaurant Week menu.  I started off with the calamari appetizer, which was a very generous portion.  The server brought some flavored vinegar to dip the calamari in which complimented the appetizer really well.  The calamari was light, crispy and delicious.  My dad got the porcini mushroom soup which he really enjoyed.  We both got the Wagyu and Wild Boar Meatloaf served with sweet potato risotto and a touch of BBQ sauce.  The risotto was delicious with a twist since it had the sweet potato mixed in.  The meatloaf was a bit spicy and could have used perhaps a little more BBQ sauce but was otherwise very tasty with a nice savory flavor.  For dessert we both got the Peanut Butter Bomb.  It was like a warm, soft peanut butter cookie baked in a little round cake pan with vanilla ice cream.

The ambiance and the restaurant environment is wonderful. It would be a perfect place to celebrate a special occasion.  They really did a great job with the décor, including the warm, cozy fireplace."}
{"text":"One star at very best! My first time at Ken Stewarts was shortly after they opened.  While they may have had kinks to work out the food was average at best. Brings me to tonight. If an establishment has average food but excellent service it will remain noteworthy and memorable in a positive light. . Tonight I walked in party of one. I was hoping to sit in the bar but the only thing available was a hightop. Unfortunately I was told I could not sit there. I am a party of one.....how long could I linger? The rest was barely hustling but a decent crowd. This created a frenetic energy that consumed the entire team. The hostess completely frazzled pointed to counter at kitchen and said I could sit there.  Looking down as she spoke I asked her to repeat herself. Meanwhile two managers commanded her attention all the while cutting me off mid sentence. Finally she walked me to the counter, removed a sport coat from the chair and said here. I asked if someone was sitting there she replied \"just the manger\". Awesome his computer was still set up with his blackberry....maybe I could get work done. There were actually three other open spots for the record I was just given the used one. Say there for 11 minutes and not one person acknowledged me....even the manager!! At every turn it just got worse! Touché for providing such a negative experience that I have popped my review writing cherry! The experience was not only a major disappoint for me but brand damaging for Ken Stewart."}
{"text":"I had a work related dinner at this place and our dinner was served with a buffet style. We had drinks at the patio area and that was a really nice touch~

The superfood salad was really good. It's tossed but the greens were not drown in dressing. Our entrees included grilled chicken breasts and pan seared salmon. The chicken breast were not dried and the salmon were not over cooked (score!). The chicken breasts were ok - nothing extraordinary. The salmons were cooked properly and surprisingly they did not become too over cooked after seating out in the buffet station for a while (and they were still warm!). 
The mushroom \"risotto\" was probably the star of the night. It's super flavorful. But I'm not sure if it's really a risotto - the rice was not cooked down as much as a typical risotto would be. But it's a yummy side dish for sure. 

The weird thing was the dessert - the mini cheesecake was crust-less (maybe they were trying to offer some sort of gluten free dessert...?) Anyhow. The dinner was nice but it's just an ok experience. But I do wanna come back and try other stuff on the menu and hopefully it'll be a better experience!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Saturday. Everything was delicious from the drinks to the main course. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice and welcoming.

We had the shrimp appetizer, house salad and the Austrailian Wagyu. All very good and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We conducted a pretty neat randomized controlled experiment at this restaurant.  

I came here with coworkers for a sponsored dinner.  We were given a choice of entree.  Every single person at my table ordered the strip steak.  They told every person that the steak was medium rare, is this okay?, and every person said yes, they wanted their steak medium rare.  Hypothesis: Six medium rare steaks.

My steak was a clear well done.  Not pink at all on the inside, no juice when I cut into it.  The person to my right, also well done.  The person to my left, medium.  Next to him, medium rare.  Next to him, well done.  Last person, well done.  So, six orders of medium rare turned into four well done steaks, one medium, and one medium rare.

Conclusion: They could really work on their meat temperatures."}
{"text":"Great restaurant-one of the best in Ohio.  Interesting, varied menu.  The Lobster Pot Pie is \"to die for.\" Professional, friendly service.  Expensive, but worth it.  You don't feel ripped off.  Ken Stewart is the master of restaurants in this area.  He is a real maestro."}
{"text":"Ken Stewart personally greeted me the second time I ate here.  Honestly, after introducing himself he looked like he was preparing to autograph something for me.

A legend in his own mind... and in Akron, this restaurateur is taking a crack at Cleveland's limited, high-end market.  Good thing he's at a posh hotel, because I don't think he'd make it with the locals.  It's a more expensive and pretentious version of XO.

I've eaten here approximately ten times.  Seven of my visits were good experiences.  Great French Onion soup, interesting lunch sandwiches, and well-prepared steaks at dinner.

The other three visits...  French Onion Soup with the wrong cheese slapped on top, a Lobster Bisque that I swear was spoiled, and a \"grilled cheese\" sandwich that was nearly inedible.

Now, should a patron forgive a 30% failure rate at a brand new restaurant, especially with really nice servers?  Well, maybe if the cooks didn't bark their objections over the line into the restaurant when food is returned.

It seems at Ken Stewart's the customer is always wrong.  Sorry, but I don't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"ken stewart goes north
to awaken the east bank
river renaissance

The Powerhouse is on the west bank, but the east bank stirs to life after all these years with none other than its own powerhouse, Ken Stewart, veteran restaurateur throwing down hard with a new spot in the flats.  And it takes a veteran pro to come out this strong from the gate. Personally, I have a lot of respect for that, as opposed to places that open with excuses of being \"new\" and still charge full prices.  For those, I have no tolerance.  

Walking in, we were greeted by the entire Stewart family.  Nice!  Ken, big personality and consummate professional, showed us to the bar area.  The bar is a stunner.  Colorful, comfortable, and a solid inventory.  No soda guns, but small bottles of soda, ginger ale and the like. What a HUGE difference that makes.  A very nice cocktail list, and well trained bartenders to make them. A hat tip to bartender Molly, who made me a perfectly balanced bourbon/lemon/basil cocktail that was truly a delight. Full flavor spectrum, with the basil top-note being a nuance, and not a hammer. Also, the herb was not muddled into an oblivion that gets all caught up in your teeth.

We had a few appetizers that were exceptional, along with a small, cast iron pan of traditional \"Parker house\" rolls that I could eat all day. Our mussels came in a light curry broth that those rolls proved a perfect vessel for.  Very, very good.
We also had Hamachi sashimi that was fresh, and all in all, outstanding.  I wished for a few more slices, but it is perfect example of quality over quantity.  Actually, it was just the right amount.
My personal favorite was the steak tartar.  Actually, a simple dish that when properly executed is beef heaven. If it is on the menu, I usually order it. I've had it in NYC's Le Halle, and it made me sad.  I had it in various Chicago restaurants, and when I found a good one, I could not get it made the same way twice in a row. The Greenhouse Tavern here in Cleveland does a rock solid tartar, and that makes me happy.  
But the tartar at East Bank is special. Coarsely ground prime beef topped with a perfect egg yolk, served simply and traditionally, with toast points, capers, and onions, this was, by far, the best tartar I ever had. 

I'm looking forward to dinner here.  I don't think I'll be ordering a steak anywhere else, as the beef here starts with U.S. Prime, and works its way up to Japanese Wagyu, complete with individual steer certification. Get this.  The certificate of authenticity includes a nose print.  On the certificate. And probably a full DNA profile as well.  

This place is a game changer for Cleveland Steakhouses, and can hang with any of the heavy hitters anywhere. 
Bravo.

Carry on..."}
{"text":"The food is average here but you have to take a second mortgage to afford it. The only view you see is over the railroad and a construction in front of it.  

The owner greeted us and is very very arrogant."}
{"text":"After 24 hours of meetings over two days, my work team definitely needed some cocktails, wine, and great food.

Our esteemed leader decided to take all of us out to Ken Stewart's and it was the perfect venue.

We gathered at the bar to celebrate the end of a lot of hard work, and I ordered their special Manhattan.  Wow!  Smoky, smooth, and sweet, with the perfect big ice cube and marinated cherries.  The bartender was warm, friendly, and quite skilled and efficient.  A real plus with over a dozen of us in attendance.

On to the dinner.  Excellent server and fantastic wine list.  A variety of starters including shrimp cocktail, calamari, stuffed peppers, and other warm delights paired very well with the warm and fluffy rolls.  

I opted for the pistachio crab cakes and they did not disappoint.  The crunchy nuttiness off set the rich savory crab cakes (the size of tennis balls!) nicely, and the shards of fried taro were a nice little textural surprise.  I couldn't finish it, a rarity for me.

An assortment of cool, creamy, and sweet deserts followed to share.

What a great place!  So very accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"Wish I could be as enthusiastic as the other reviews but we (4 in the party) were disappointed.  

After hearing so much about Ken's in the Akron area for so long I couldn't wait to have a special dinner at the new location in Cleveland.  None of the 4 of us will go back as there are just too many other great places in Cleveland to dine.  Only 1 in the party had a meal that was satisfactory.  For the rest of us, one or more of the courses was either cold, tasteless or poorly presented.  For our money we'll hit Flemings, Mortons, OX, Lola - you name it.  

Decor is ok but I would like to suggest they tone down the TV monitor in the main dining room.  It displayed a ship on the lake (very cool) but it was a day time picture and with the room lights being low for dinner (very pleasant) those of us facing the monitor were blasted by the bright light of the day time sky in the picture.  I night time shot would have been better.

Sorry Ken & Company."}
{"text":"We recently went to Ken Stewart's and our waiter Josh made the experience great.  We had the Lobster Pot Pie, Wild Boar Meatloaf, and the side of Au Gratin Potatoes. The meatloaf was great and loved the flavor and risotto it sat on.  I am only rating them a 4/5 because we frequent Flemings in Akron and I had to compare Ken Stewarts potatoes to Flemings and Flemings pulls it out for us."}
{"text":"Restaurant week is the best week. At a place like this, you can beat the prices for what you're getting. 

Our experience was wonderful from start to finish. Our bartender and waitress were both polite and sweet, going out of the way to make us happy. We were very well taken care of. 

I had a classic daiquiri. It was mild and foamy and a subtle complement to my meal. 

We got the calamari and the mussels for appetizers. I think the mussels won, with their spicy sauce, but both were great. We had the chicken and the filet for our entrees. Again, perfection. Small portions but perfectly cooked.  And we both got the peanut butter bomb for dessert - melt in your mouth amazing. And I am not even a peanut butter lover. 

This is probably not the best fancy restaurant I've been to in Cleveland, but it lives up to its name and is a lovely experience."}
{"text":"The food was divine!  I had the scallops and shared a dish of the yellow snapper.  The seafood tower and lobster bisque were heaven.  Dessert was just OK.  The wine list was extensive with many great choices. Ask for Sean, to be your server.  His attention to detail and knowledge of food was delightful."}
{"text":"Although I've heard the name for years, this was my first foray into a Ken Stewart establishment. The restaurant itself is really nice. Modern, sleek and classy. Good sized bar on one side and the dining room on the other. They had a good selection of beers on draft, and we're not talking Miller Light--more like Duvel. They had a list of cocktails as well which were quite yummy. Didn't look at the wine list, but I expect that was high caliber as well.

The food was pretty darned good. I wanted to hate it so I could write a review about how it's way too expensive, but you know what....it was worth every penny. Steaks were perfectly cooked, sides were amazing. I had the wagyu/boar meatloaf and absolutely loved it. And for dessert...salted caramel ice cream. There's really no better way to end a good meal.

So would I go back? Yes. Will it be frequently? No. Even though it was stellar, the prices really keep it from being a weekly staple.  Definitely consider it for a special occassion though."}
{"text":"Visited Ken Stewart's on Valentine's Day.  The overall dining experience was great and I was in excellent company.  However, considering the price tag, there are far better choices elsewhere.  

Service: 
My date and I were greeted at the door and quickly shown to our reserved seats.  The waitress was cordial, knowledgeable about the menu (including wagyu beef grading system), and imparted a warm feeling to a subjectively biased, already pleasant Valentine's Day evening.  Coat check personnel was slightly awkward as she gave us our coat and abruptly looked the other way to greet an entering group of guests.  

Food:
Oysters for appetizers, U.S.D.A. prime aged petite filet mignon + lobster tail for me, \"true\" Japanese 100% wagyu beef from Kagoshima + lobster tail for my date, sides of brussel sprouts and creamed spinach, and a chocolate cake for dessert (which came with a complimentary chocolate-covered strawberry).  

Ambiance:
Dressy.  Lots of old white men in suits with their dress-up dates.  The occasional smattering of middle aged/youngsters (perhaps dining here on this special occasion).  

For a price tag well above 3 digits, I expect to be treated only slightly short of royalty.  And as for the food, I expected it to be AMAZING.  Who knows, maybe my expectations are too high?  After all, how amazing can food be?  Maybe there's a saturation point and things taste pretty much the same once it hits the $40+ mark.  Well, by that logic, then we would all be fools for going to places that charge beyond that amount right?  I've seen more plump oysters, tasted better seared and flavored filet mignons, and definitely had better lobsters.  The lobster tail was a $40 add on and it was pretty dry and tough.  I tried the wagyu, pretty good...but $130 good?  Was my mouth dancing with joy, was I transported to Japan on clouds, did I want that moment to last forever?  Nope, not at all.  Brussel sprouts were undercooked (unless you like the bitter crunch) and spinach was overcooked (unless you like mush).  Dessert was just your average 'ol dessert.  Can't really go wrong with chocolate cake.  No idea what small amount of fortune it was though.

So if this was an episode of master chef and I was one of the judges having to put a price tag on this meal, I would say my dinner should've been $70 tops ($200 total including what my date had and what we shared).  And those are generous estimates.  But instead, I'm pretty sure the bill was well above that.  To make things worse, a couple of days later I bought a T-bone USDA choice steak from Dave's supermarket.  Pan seared it in butter and olive oil along with a butter poached lobster tail (ordered frozen from internet!).  And both my steak and lobster was FAR more delicious.  In the end, either Ken Stewart's deserves no more than 3 stars or I should quit my day job and open up a competing steak/seafood restaurant!"}
{"text":"The bartender, Danielle, needs a little refresher on her customer service skills. She blatantly ignored us at the bar while introducing herself to everyone else that happened to come in. The food and drinks are extremely overpriced. $15 for a Bulleit Manhattan? No thanks, especially when your bartender has the personality of a wet bar towel."}
{"text":"Ken Stewart's East Bank is brand spanking new.  After visiting Aloft Hotels, we stopped in for a drink so our experience is limited.

The decor is dark with chain chandaleirs and fire pits surrounding nicely sized mini booths.  Behind the bar is a wall of lit up liqour bottles, which though done before, is always colorful and themeatic...I mean, it is a bar!  

The drinks all include hand-squeezed juices and even their Moscow Mule is served in a copper cup (although not a Moscow Mule cup, which is strange).  Thing is, these drinks, though well made, are not cheap.  Expect to pay $14 for a cocktail.  

I can see where as this place is built up around, it will be a great restaurant, but as it is now, I don't see it worth while as a destination on it's own.  Then again, I didn't eat there."}
{"text":"They have a great patio and great food.  

Their bar menu is very good and substantial so you can eat delicious food for a reasonable price.  

I also really enjoy their wine list.  You can get many great wines by the glass and they also don't mark up their by the bottle prices either.  I have never had a bad meal and the service is friendly too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try during Restaurant Week.  We were seated with a perfect view of the sun setting over the Flats. Staff were friendly and our server Barbara was helpful, efficient and pleasant. 

We both ordered from the $30 Restaurant Week menu. I had the mushroom soup, chicken and chocolate tiramisu -- all were very good. My husband ordered the wedge salad, scallops and peanut butter bomb.   He enjoyed the salad and scallops, but his dessert was just too sweet to eat. Our waitress warned us that the portions would be smaller than their regular menu, but seemed adequate for both of us. I am not sure if you had a big appetite, it would be enough.

In looking over the regular menu the prices seemed out of line, more like NYC prices. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience and food was good, but think I would return only during RW because of the prices.  

The three stars is based purely on the issue of prices as staff and ambience was four stars."}
