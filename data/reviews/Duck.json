{"text":"Duck has great pork.
Seriously.

BBQ pork, tender bok choy, and rice.
Sometimes simple is awesome.
Price is right and taste is even righter.
And it's a feel good bonus, that you get to support a local mom and pop shop.

Eat here."}
{"text":"As the store name suggests it makes good Ducks, I had bbq pork + roasted duck on rice, total comes to 9.50. It would've been 7.50 for duck only or 6.50 for bbq only, if you opt for just one kind of meat. The portion is huge, it's the same taste you found in Hong Kong, very authentic !"}
{"text":"Roasted meats in a food court and its reasonably price! 

The only draw back I have is they close too early for me to pick something up for dinner. They're usually out of their before 6:30pm."}
{"text":"I had an underwhelming experience eating their noodle soup. Although the meat was okay, the soup base was very bland and flavorless just like the veggies. 
Still, the quality is okay, for a food court. The personnel was nice but be aware that , they only take cash. 
It's a 2.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Ordered BBQ duck with rice, tastes very good!  It comes with good portion of duck, veggie and a huge portion of rice (with some kind of sauce in it).  I'll definitely ask for half the rice next time.  Don't forget to ask for plum sauce, it makes the duck tastes better."}
{"text":"I ordered BBQ pork on rice from a fairly gruff and unfriendly man who I understand to be the owner. He pushed his overpriced and very old tea eggs, and was angry when I politely declined. The meal came with bok choy, and in the folds of the leaves I found a dead German cockroach. I brought this to the owner's attention, and requested a refund. The owner snatched my tray away and inspected the leaves, shouted something in Mandarin, and whisked my tray back into the kitchen. 

While waiting, a fellow patron of the food court related that she too had found cockroaches in her meal and had been refused a refund. The owner emerged from the kitchen and thrusted the container back into my hands, having replaced the bok choy. I explained that I didn't want to eat from his establishment, and that I'd like a refund. He emphatically and loudly refused, causing quite a stir in the food court.

I would highly recommend that this establishment be avoided until their cockroach infestation is adequately dealt with."}
{"text":"I have only ordered roast duck from here, and I have been back many times, but only for the duck. They sell the roast duck as a whole duck for $19 or 1/2 duck for $10. It is pretty good value, for downtown and the duck is usually pretty good. It is not overcooked and nicely seasoned. I was super happy when I discovered that this place serves decent roast duck, no more biking to Chinatown for duck!
They also have chinese BBQ pork, roast pork and soy-sauce chicken. Visually the BBQ pork looks good but I have never tried it, so I can not say for sure. They are CASH ONLY and closes at 7pm on the dot."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been coming here ever since I discovered it a year ago. Where else can you find BBQ meats in a food court?

Their roast pork is amazing - super crispy skin and not overly salty. They also have roast duck, spy sauce chicken, and BBQ pork. Take your pick or rice or noodles - I generally prefer noodles for lunch, but if you have a big appetite, the rice portions are huge! Sometimes I'll get a rice for take out and there's enough rice for two people. 

The soup broth tastes like it is duck based and very flavourful. Add in some leafy veg (usually bok choy or shanghai bok choy), ginger scallion sauce, and bean sprouts, this is a very satisfying bowl to consume."}
{"text":"All that needs to be said is get a pound of BBQ pork."}
{"text":"Definitely my go to lunch spot for cheap bbq pork and rice. don't expect anything nice from the dragon lady cashier, but it's super quick and pretty good and cheap for being in College Park. I hesitate to give it 4 stars, because the quality is just alright, nothing to write home about except for the price, location and convenience."}
{"text":"With a name like Duck, it's pretty easy to guess what is served.

Located in the College Park food court, this fast food joint doesn't disappoint!
It's probably not actually a 4-star place, but compared to the other lunch options nearby, it's one of your best bets.

Ducks hanging from a display, BBQ pork, soya chicken... it's like getting an authentic Chinatown meal with slightly inflated prices.

The BBQ pork meal is around 6 bucks, a good serving of meat, rice, and overcooked bok choi... it's pretty tasty!

They have lunch specials and most meals have a noodle option.

The selection here isn't huge, but if you want your BBQ meat basics, Chinese curry, or wonton noodles, you'll find these items here.

Duck is one of my favourite quick and cheap lunch spots!"}
{"text":"i just had their vegetable soup and found a cockroach in my soup.  it was nasty!!!! i have lost my appetite for the rest of the day. do not go to duck they are so dirty."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at how satisfying my meal was here.
In the food court at College Park, next to the entrance to the College subway station. 

I came on a Sunday around 2PM and sadly they only had one option available: #6 Beef noodle soup or rice for $7.50. I wanted to try #2, which was the BBQ duck noodle soup for the same price but I will come by earlier next time. 

They put lots of things inside the clear plastic bowl: soup, lai fun (thick rice noodles), beef brisket, bok choy, crispy bean sprouts and grated carrots. Was this the beefiest soup I've ever had? Of course not. But it still had the beef flavour. I was very happy about getting lai fun because a lot of restaurants don't even serve this type of noodle anymore, and it was cooked well. The beef brisket was tender, but still some chew to it. All in all a great meal and I will be back. 

Only recommendation I would have is that they should provide Asian style soup spoons as well.
Cash only."}
{"text":"I always get my soy chicken and BBQ duck here, and I'm never had any complains about it. Unfortunately I decided to try the beef noodle which was a huge disappointment because the beef taste like plastic, and the vegetable (I believe is the shanghai book choy) was stale. Bottom line, if you're going to order from a place call duck, stick with duck."}
{"text":"Cheap and good portion! Tastes like what you would get from a restaurant but in a food court. Super fast! Good spot for lunch"}
{"text":"For a food court Chinese duck place, this really is as good as it gets.  I first found this place when I worked in the building.  It was quite quickly my go-to lunch place - and a perfect location to take food out.  You can buy meals for lunch just like other places, as a combo with rice or noodles, or as soups, but you can also order meats by weight.

I'm particularly fond of their BBQ pork - I love it and regularly buy a pound to take home and serve at dinner. Despite the fact that I no longer work in the area, I make effort to get visit this food court just for Duck."}
{"text":"Considering the fact that this place is in the College Park which is nowhere near china town, Duck is quite decent. Food tastes great and price is not too bad."}
{"text":"I'm truly disappointed in this place :( after growing uptown in Markham where Chinese BBQ is everywhere, I wanted to find a Chinese BBQ place near me so I wouldn't have to go all the way to Chinatown to satisfy my cravings. I ordered soy sauce chicken on rice and I got a huge serving of white rice which is expected, some steamed veggies and the smallest chicken leg I have ever encountered. It was also super dry with little flavour."}
{"text":"Ok so kudos for them being a Chinese bbq place in a food court. But the duck over rice i had was the worst I've ever had. The duck was dry and tasteless, the sauce just way way too sweet without any depth of flavour, the bok choy was cold and hard. So I actually didn't eat it, went someplace else and ate something else."}
{"text":"For a food court restaurant, Duck is pretty good. I had the BBQ Pork, which was quite tasty, but the meat-to-rice ratio was not the most ideal (aka I had a lot of leftover rice). However, for the price, I really shouldn't complain too much.

The owners were very nice. They talked me into ordering two tea eggs ($1 each). They were delicious and made me miss home cooking.

While I think Chinatown has many better options, I will likely return due to the convenience. It's nice to have a decent Chinese food place right at the downtown core. Looking forward to trying their soup noodle dishes."}
{"text":"IMO probably the best BBQ pork in Toronto! I work in the building and love going there for lunch to get BBQ pork on rice (comes with some Bok Choy too) for about $6. U also have option to get it with noodles and soup instead of rice."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this duck. Placed my order and didn't quite understand the server that they only take cash and no cards. Told her that I'd be right back and she rudely pulled my order away. Returned from the ATM with cash and reordered once my turn came back up. The male server began to have my order filled but the female server came up and pulled my order out from under the counter. The cooled off dark meat duck was extremely over fatty and greasy. Couldn't even save it with the sriracha sauce. The greens were limper than my u know what  Pretty much needed a towel rather than the napkins."}
{"text":"Good pork meal, cheap economic and fills your stomach. However, their duck is above average and deserve some attention. As other comments have mentioned, they close quite early so sometimes I had to rush there after school. Their spring rolls are worth a try as well."}
{"text":"Had a really bad day so I decided to head here to get some comfort food. I paid 6.95 for soy sauce chicken noodle which was better than I expected though the chicken was slightly overcooked but the taste was good they were generous to give lots of toppings like sliced red carrot, chopped ginger and leeks. The chinese owner was nice to customers and it's really big plus."}
{"text":"This place sucks not only the duck skin is not cleaned properly there is still some duck hair on it also they dont know how to cook rice its so dry and almost crunchy. For the tiny portion its overpriced and super disappointing. I was just craving for BBQ duck but i would rather trevel a bit further to get better one next time. Plus its in downtown core the duck most likely sit on the counter for a whole day. Awww"}
{"text":"LOL I ordered the cha siu rice with veggies it was really fast like no wait time at all 

plus they all speak canto for a second it feels like home but the cha siu is really bad imo it tastes like pork chop... but i guess that's my only choice cuz I'm too lazy to go outside college park 

cheap and fast chinese food!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for 7 years already. My go-to order is the chicken with soup noodle (I forget the name, it's pieces of soy chicken with a generous serving of green onion and ginger sauce, in soup with noodles). It's delicious and the price can't be beat either. For the food I will give 5 stars.

Here is where I'll take off a star. The owner is extremely rude. I commented once as I was paying that their food is delicious and I've been coming for years. He just scoffed. I wanted to show him how much I like his food and he scoffs? Perhaps he didn't understand what I was saying, but a smile can't hurt."}
{"text":"Soy chicken on rice is always decent here.  Not a fan of the BBQ pork, as it is a bit tough, and once you have had tender and tasty versions in Markham and Richmond Hill, it's hard to settle for inferior Charsiu.  But the soy chicken is good here, I think it's a dish that is difficult to mess up.

They add some Chinese greens which seems to be the standard at Chinese BBQ places.

It's a quick and handy option and for the College Park crowd, much closer than Spadina.

Even though it's called Duck, I have never had the Duck, maybe I should try that next time!"}
{"text":"A perfectly good lunch option in the busy College Park food court, undermined by their \"cash only\" policy.

I work in the area. I love Chinese barbecue. And noodle soups. 

Duck sells these items, and per other reviewers they do a pretty good job of it at reasonable prices. 

I'd think they were more reasonable if they took credit cards, though."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Some of the better BBQ meats are no longer in China Town!

You would never expect to find this gem in, of all places, the College Park food court. It's been around for about a year or two, and simply put, the BBQ meats are surprisingly good, the service is lightning fast and the prices are rock bottom ($6 for a rice box, tax included!).

The business model is simple: offer quality BBQ'ed duck and pork, then throw it on rice and fresh bok choy. Their meats are tender, flavourful and not overly fatty or burnt. I'm surprised to say that I think they beat out most of the places I've tried in China Town - both in quality and price! Folks, this place ain't reinventing the wheel, but damn, you owe it yourself to stop by if you're ever in the 'hood and have some BBQ meat cravings."}
{"text":"This place has by far the best duck and BBQ pork that I have EVER had. Good stuff. Prices are decent. I honestly didn't expect this quality from a joint in the fast food court. 

That said, their specials aren't so good. One was a curry dish and the other was a plop of cut up pork in sauce. I forget the names but both were a disservice to an otherwise great place to eat."}
{"text":"I finally made the trek out to Duck a few weeks ago! But because I was craving crispy bbq pork more than duck, that's what I had.  

It was pricier than I expected - a plate of crispy bbq pork over rice was just under $8.  Better than Goldstone (see my review), but still higher than I thought.  Maybe the reviews I came across about $6 meals are older, though.

The rice looked dry, but it actually had a generous amount of sauce on it, which I really, really liked.

The crispy bbq pork itself was...okay.  The top was crispy, the portions were very decent (unlike Goldstone), but some of the pork belly tasted super sinewy.  I chewed and chewed 'til the cows came home, and still I couldn't swallow some pieces - I had to spit them out, gross as that sounds.  But the pieces that weren't sinewy were good, and I really appreciated that the insides weren't overseasoned.  Most Chinese bbq places put a ton of salt and spices in the inside of crispy roasted pork, and I usually discard those parts.  Duck's was seasoned very well.

I'm still on a hunt for my go-to Chinese bbq place, though I will keep this one as a back up in my mind or if I can't find better!"}
