{"text":"We visited on a Monday lunch. We were a group of three mommies with three strollers. Honestly, not a group that is appealing to any restaurant but all the servers there were very helpful in accommodating us. Thumbs up for that. Food is okay. I had a landing burger. It was a bit dry. I would be better if it's more juicy."}
{"text":"We are four friends that like to go for dinner on a Saturday night. We live in the beaches and thought we would try Carter's Landing. Beautiful Saturday evening, and we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner in a lovely location, watching the sun set over the lake, enjoying good friends and food. NOT the case, we were seated at a table and once the server came we order our wine only to be told that both the red and white were take off the menu. We ordered our food and I was told that they were out of the two items we wanted - It was only 7:30 pm.....Placed our order and when present the food - it was all mixed up - 3 steaks - 3 different ways and none of us got what we asked for and I left a napkin filled with fat and grizzle on my plate. For the price of the steaks, they were not cooked to our order and the fries were cold. I had asked for salt and finally after watching our server 'chit chat' with other servers , I had to get up and get it from another table. I asked for ice water and after several requests, finally she got the message. It wasn't that she was a bad server, she wasn't trained properly as a server. The food was not her problem, however, she should be aware we are being served and pay attention to our needs. The food however , is the chefs problem. There was absolutely no care in preparation, the steaks were all different sizes, they were bland and I am so sorry that I agreed to dine there.  You have a great location and that is about all that I can say - the service - from the front of the house - no welcome and no thank you and goodnight, come again.  - to our server, that either had to many tables or very distracted and who knew we were very disappointed - did nothing, to the bad food at a high cost. I'm going to pack my own dinner and sit on the beach to watch the sun set over the lake in future. This is the first and last time I will visit Carter's Landing and frankly from the reviews I have read on your page - I'm not the only person unhappy. 0 Stars"}
{"text":"After an initial terrible experience I returned hoping for a better experience. Unfortunately service continued to be terrible. Our waitress did not know the menu, took incorrect orders and made four mistakes on the bill. This was similar to my first visit and will not make a third."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Carters Landing on Friday night. I really enjoyed the patio, food was great and the service was very friendly. My husband and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This places has beautiful views (it's right on the beach) and looks very nice, but that's where it ends for me. I showed up looking to have lunch. The hostess was friendly and sat me down at a table. I sat there for 10 minutes and no server ever said hello. I got up and left. That being said, I did take a look at the menu. 

Draft beers at $6-$7, which sounds fine, until you see that you only get a 14oz glass. A pint is 20oz. 14oz is 70% of a pint...for $7! Effectively, this place is charging $10 for pints and they don't have a great craft selection (all InBev corporate pseudo craft beers). If I'm going to pay $10 a pint, I'll just go drink at the Air Canada Centre or the Skydome."}
{"text":"I came here with six friends after playing volleyball on a recent Thursday evening.

While the staff were overall friendly, I couldn't help but think it was because they were so disorganized and were trying to make up for it. It took a good 15 minutes or so after sitting down for a server to come to our table and take our orders. At that point, other servers starting coming to us and asking us what we wanted. We told them that we were already being served.

One server came to our table to give us the beers we had ordered. They all looked the same, and impressed, I asked her if she was able to tell them apart. She replied in a somewhat condescending tone, \"Yes I caaaaan.\" Sure enough, we all got different beers than the ones we ordered, and they had to take them back.

Great location if you're on the beaches, but that's the easy part. Ensuring that customers' orders are being tended to is what really makes the difference in a bar/restaurant, and our recent experience wasn't evidence of that."}
{"text":"Super slow service.  Disorganized greeting area. Calamari terrible. Burger ok. Pricey."}
{"text":"Just like the other Landings; great ambiance, decor, and atmosphere but pricey drinks and mediocre food. The wings were good though."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday last night. The decor was great, and the hostesses were wonderfully nice and helpful. The FIRST (this is key) server to come over was fine. I just ordered water, as I was waiting for my party to arrive.

The SECOND server to come over was also perfectly fine, ordered a cheap beer, which was perfectly fine as well.

The problem started with the THIRD sever, who unfortunately was with us all night. He was extremely short with everyone, snapping at us and scowling the entire time. We were in the process of ordering, and one of us ordered a pizza. His response was an angry, snappy 'No pizza'. That's it, not 'I'm sorry, we're not able to make pizza right now' or any explanation or apology. My friend who was ordering for her child, blinked, looked at him and questioningly said 'Oh, it's not on the kids menu? Or....?' and he responded deadpanned 'No pizza'. 

After that we ordered some drinks, and our meals. Two wrong beers came, and were quickly sent back and replaced with the correct ones. Our meals come out, or do they? Nope, someone brought our table the wrong food meant for another. When our actual food does come, one of our party had ordered a chicken cesar salad and got a curry chicken. When she brought it to our sever's attention, he looked at her and said 'No, you ordered the curry chicken'. She had to insist that he take it back and replace it.

The food was great, well-priced, and the drinks were fine. A good selection of craft beers, ciders, etc.

At the end of the night, we asked for separate bills. Instead, we got a single bill with items grouped to our 'assigned seats'. However, every one of the groupings was incorrect, with items all mixed up. Our sever brought the debit machine, processed the first individual's order, and promptly left us to pass the machine amongst ourselves and process our own payments.

In short, despite the food being alright, I don't think any of us will be going back due to the poor experience."}
{"text":"Service is awful. Beer was warm, we asked for cold beers and did not drink the warm ones but they left them at the table and of course charges showed up on the bill. Wings were super large and unpleasant. No cutlery or napkins served before or after we received the meal and we had to ask for them. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Orded a stake frites here and it was perfect. It was grilled exactly how I requested it and the sauce was marvelous. Strangely enough it went really good with my tea aswel, which made the waiter and me giggle."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed by this new resto...despite the controversy had heard good things about it. Let me start
off by saying that the people are friendly and nice...decor and large patio are great...food was good too...nothing outstanding but well prepared and tasty. And then there's the service...our server took our order...left the menus behind and disappeared.  After about an hour we asked someone else to find our server so that we could ask about our meal.  After about another 20 mins no server but someone else delivered our meal. We asked for salt, pepper and ice...nothing'. Then we asked someone else for same...nothing. Finally a complaint to management who apologized and brought the ice...still no salt and pepper.  Finally our sever who apologized profusely and hovered...not cool.  We ordered coffee...and we only wanted cream...but she brought a lot of milk and we had to explain which colour container was cream. Then she disappeared again. Will never return."}
{"text":"We just spent 15 min waiting to be served. We were seated in between two tables who were both served multiple times while we were seated. We just got tired of waiting and left. Terrible service. 


NB. I was wearing a camouflage jacket so maybe the staff couldn't see me."}
{"text":"Ambiance, location, decor, menu selection, prices and hostesses were great.

On the other hand, food was average and might've been better had the service not been so disappointingly deplorable.  We sat at our table of 9 for 25 minutes unattended then I went to find a server, during the whole meal we had to ask for everything 2 or 3 times (water, condiments), our table was never cleared, sat around waiting for the bill for 20 minutes, then had to go find the hostess who tracked down our server who finally brought the bill so we could leave.  Entire time in the restaurant was 2 hours & 45 minutes.  90% of the time we sat at our table 'waiting' and/or 'looking for our server'."}
{"text":"There's a bit of controversy around having chain restaurants at the Beach, but I for one, am a fan! It's a beautiful venue with lots of indoor and outdoor seating, and there's some seating around fire pits which will be great in cooler weather. 
Our server was really friendly and helpful and let us taste the wine before we decided on a bottle. My friend and I ordered the cheese and meat platter to share, but it was definitely big enough for 2 with some left over. I suspect the cheeses were bought from the processed cheese section from the supermarket and the meats were pre-cut deli slices, but if you're not fancy, it's good enough!! The quantity makes up for the quality."}
{"text":"Was visiting the beach in Toronto while visiting from NYC. So stopped by here for lunch and a drink. The restaurant is very nice loved the outside and the ambiance. The waitress was very sweet. Obviously the location was perfect. My friend and I ordered a turkey burger and sweet potato fries to share. Everything was so SALTY. I mean, I eat pretty healthy regularly so my tastebuds might be a bit sensitive than most. But goodness.. We both couldn't finish our food because the salt situation was serious. I gave it 3 stars for service and location alone. Overall not the worst maybe we just came on an off day."}
{"text":"Nice location close to Woodbine beach. Summer patio has high chairs and umbrellas (very important in summer heat). We were here for lunch and I had jerk chicken sandwich which was absolutely delicious and my partner had a cobb salad was looked pretty good."}
{"text":"I have now been sitting at my table now for over 35 minutes, took 15 just to get a server and a glass of water. It's now been over 15 since we put in a drink order. I am a server and this is horrible. I'm looking at tables that have been waiting to pay since we sat down. They always seem to be understaffed, as this has happened before and I was giving this place a second chance. People are now walking off your patio and we are close to doing the same. It is the holiday Monday, by the beach and you guys can't even seem to staff properly for what would be a obviously busy day. This will be my last visit to Carter's. Where are your managers? Where is any support staff? Just awful service"}
{"text":"Great spot by the Beach for a Corporate Event! 

We brought down 70+ employees for a company engagement / social event and booked out the indoor area overlooking the patio.  The Restaurant Manager (John) and day-of serving team (Donna, Lisa) did a fantastic job taking care of us.  Getting a menu, pricing, and the additional snacks / fruit plate orders set up was really easy with John.  

The group lunch pricing was great, the Carter's Landing staff were very flexible and intuitive in accommodating our needs, and all the employees really enjoyed the food (most important!).   Even though the meal was mass-catered, the kitchen did a fantastic job ensuring every dish that came out was hot, fresh and delicious.  I heard great feedback especially about the Tomato Bisque soup, chicken pasta and the Landing Burger (and Yam Burger!).  

My only improvement point was about the speed of getting the food on the table - would have given us more play time after lunch before we had to bus everyone out.  To be fair, we came in late from our team building activities on the beach which likely stalled the kitchen, and each dish was very well prepared.  Perhaps we should look at buffet style next time... 

Great experience all around and we will certainly look to do this again in the future!  This is a great place for a group Beach outing - with the comforts of a beautiful, contemporary and well air-conditioned space. Parking was also free at this time of year so that was a bonus! 

Thanks again!"}
{"text":"I was hoping it was the growing pains of recently opening and finding their mojo, but unfortunately the service at this place has a lot to be desired. We've been at different times of the year, of the day, both when it was busy and quiet. It really doesn't matter, seems this place is just badly managed overall. 

Servers are slow to take orders, orders are slow to come out, some staff wander aimlessly while others seem overworked, management is sometimes simpatico, most times apathetic. What a waste of a great location. I actually dread going to Carter's Landing when someone suggests it since it's been consistently bad during my last few visits."}
{"text":"We loved it! We had visited carters landing twice this WEEK. The first time was for our anniversary day out at the beach and the second time with family (a group of 6) BONUS: they offer gluten free and vegetarian options!!

Our 1st visit: we were greeted at the front right away by a hostess, we were pleased with the decor and the views were like being on vacation! Got a table on the patio and enjoyed the views of the beach, we enjoyed a wonderful lunch,  our waitress was friendly and sociable, the food was served fairly quickly, But I noticed  my steak was over cooked although I still found it was delicious, when our waitress came by to visit and see how our food was,  we mentioned it to our waitress and right away she offered to replace my dish with a new one or anything else,  I chose to keep it. With some things;  she was a little forgetful like our water refills, which we received after requesting it from another server,  in the end she had taken my whole meal off the bill admitted to seeing that my food wasn't as I had requested and offered an apology.. after paying our bill she mentioned to show it at the parking lot and we received our money back for parking! Which was great  
With the nice make up it made us want to return for the second time, which we did  today...
Our 2nd visit: we were greater right away and were seated in the dining room, this time for dinner- a table for 6. Everyone received  their orders quickly, no mistakes were made. This time the food was a 10! Every single person was super pleased! Well made and delicious!
The kids meals were a typical $10 which included a drink, an app which includes a veggie and crackers plate while they wait, and the  main with a side of fries and desert. Although we felt the main should have been a larger portion as we're used to in other restaurants, but possibly due to the appetizer many childr n might leave leftovers). Our waiter Paul was great, very professional and easygoing. Got all our orders just right and visited us just enough times and was pleasant.
Minus the minor hiccups, the overall experience was good, the children's portions could be a little
Larger, other then that- We will definitely be returning and recommending this restaurant to our friends :)"}
{"text":"Came here for New Years Eve. Their menu was pretty fairly priced for it being NYE and close to downtown. Wasn't very crowded that night. Waitress was very friendly and helpful, and accommodated some off-menu requests which showed good measure. 

They gave us a free glass of champagne for the ball drop in a back room which had a DJ, although the music was just ok. They made it seem like it was going to be a crazy dance party, but it kind of looked like when a wedding is winding down and the chairs and tables are starting to get packed in on the sides and clusters of people are sparsely scattered around the tables before they leave for the night. I actually didn't mind because I didn't want to be in a crazy, packed environment for NYE this year so the entertainment level was fine and worked for the situation.

The place overall is nicely decorated and sets the ambiance well with dimmed lighting and an outdoor seating area with those outdoor area warmer things. I don't think that area was open that night. 

The upstairs looks very new, almost like a loft, and had very pretty marble-looking finish in the bathrooms, and very clean. The food was very good, we got oysters, fish tacos, salmon with ancient grains and lobster fettuccine. No complaints on the food and drinks, Their sauces for the oysters and fish tacos are awesome. I think they have great food, from what I experienced that night. I'd definitely return for dinner"}
{"text":"I wanted so bad for this to be a good restaurant because as we all know, the beaches is lacking in the food department. Alas, this will not become a restaurant I will go back to eat at. 
Drinks on the patio in the summer though? Maybe.

It was slow service from the beginning, no one at  the hostess station when me and my partner arrived. We picked a table for two near the bar, as soon as we sat down we noticed the table seemed like it had not been wiped down properly, nothing glaringly horrible but noticeable just the same. Our server didn't notice this on her arrival and put the menus down on the table, we didn't say anything as we picked the table ourselves and we could have easily moved had it been that big of an issue. We started with the fried cauliflower which is served with a blue cheese dip as well as a hot sauce dip. It's was fine but not crispy enough for me, the reason being is I think it had probably been sitting for a bit before it made it to our table.. definitely could have been warmer. The dips were good, but not special by any means. My partner ordered the steak frites, with the steak ordered for medium rare. He was happy with his meal, steak was cooked properly, the red wine jus was seasoned well, he even loved the french fries, which is saying a lot because he doesn't usually care about fries at all (blasphemy I know) I ordered the brisket mac n' cheese that also had roasted squash in it. I had high hopes, unfortunately it did not deliverer on them. This dish like the cauliflower was not hot enough. I heard the service bell from the kitchen ring multiple times for food pick up, yet it didn't seem as though anyone was trying to get to the food quickly.. The cheese on the top of my pasta had hardened a bit and was in a clump which is not really appetizing as it doesn't pull apart when being picked up with the fork. Underneath that cheese was a watery sauce that was pretty bland, the roasted squash added absolutely nothing to the dish except maybe more moisture to the already soggy pasta, as well as an unpleasant hard crunch in every bite. It seemed like the squash was frozen and had not been roasted at all. The brisket tasted fine and was well cooked and shredded throughout, I wouldn't say they were generous with it though. I took half to go as it got pretty cold and I just wasn't enjoying it. We moved on to desert, my partner had the chefs choice cheese cake and I had the chocolate s'mores pie. The cheesecake was a maple with some sort of nut, my partner said it wasn't bad, but the cookie base was extremely hard, like it had been in a fridge for a long time and had dried out. My chocolate s'mores pie was frankly horrible. It most certainly had been in a fridge/ freezer far too long and tasted old and full of other fridge flavors - gross! My pie crust was nearly impossible to cut into with my spoon as well and the chocolate portion was thick and grainy with a fake chocolate flavor. I had expected this dessert to be warm like a s'more usually is, but no, it is served cold. The marshmallows should be gooey and toasted.. they were neither and It was just mini marshmallows on top that were very hard and chewy because they had been refrigerated. This was one of the worst desserts I've had at any restaurant, I only had two bites and gave up. 

Overall this dining experience was extremely mediocre, the dishes in my opinion were overpriced for what they were and definitely on the smaller side. As for drinks I had two six ounce glasses of Shiraz and those were twelve dollars each.. this would have been a fair price if they had have been eight ounces, but in my opinion too expensive for what it was. We chose to come to Carters Landing because we had a fifty dollar gift card that worked at multiple restaurants and we had been waiting to try this new place in our neighborhood. The gift card brought the price down, but I still ended up paying 66 dollars after that with tip. So without the card, this meal was over a hundred dollars and it absolutely wasn't worth it. I wanted to believe that a chain restaurant could hold its own here and be impressive because the location is fabulous. I also try to support local entrepreneurs so I am really sad to say that I won't be returning for a meal. I possibly will return for drinks on their beautiful patio in the summer though. We'll see.."}
{"text":"Ths is my review for brunch. I struggled with the number of stars to give because most of the brunch items were good. However , the eggs Benedict were sitting around for a long time and hard and stale.  I  was so excited for the crepes and waffles with different types of jams and nutella.  I was so dissapointed when I tasted that it was not nutella, it was store bought chocolate  icing...yuck!  There's were some delicious fresh cheeses, hand carved beef and trout and pork. There were also yummy salads and fruit but I still felt duped by the damn fake nutella! brunch is 22$ and includes juice tea and coffee. there is a beautiful patio but damn it. get some REAL NUTELLA- you think we can't tell the difference??"}
{"text":"The beach is a bit of a wasteland for good restaurants. I guess that's why none of the restaurants there ever make it to any \"best\" lists, which is so disappointing! There is always hope a couple of new ones, this and an Italian one, La Sala, that are worth trying! 
 I think this restaurant, Carter's Landing, is a great addition to the area, although I kind of didn't want to like it for some reason...bad press maybe? Should I really care so much about the lease agreements and big chain businesses...look at the LCBO, Shoppers Drug Mart, 2 Starbucks, another Tim Horton's, St Louis Bar and Grill all in the beach? The fact is that Carter's Landing is right at Woodbine Beach, easy access location, and has plenty of free parking! Bonus! It is one of the very few restaurants in the whole of the GTA that has waterfront views too, which is a huge plus! We decided to try it for lunch. 
 Well, we really liked it!  It has a great interior with lots of quality,  spacious, well planned seating. We shared nachos, which were made with quality ingredients and we each had a Caesar salad, which was really good too (panchetta!). Service was friendly and fairly efficient although the usual large chain \"up sell\" training was included...oh well, no pressure, just say NO! Drinks were a little slow in coming but hopefully they will iron that out.
 Yep, we will happily visit again and hopefully the quality, cleanliness and atmosphere of this fabulously located restaurant will remain consistent.
 Oh, and by the way, it would be great if they had food and drink specials!"}
{"text":"This brand new resto is well on its way to five stars in my book. Strongbow Cider not only available but on tap made my hubby a very happy camper right from the get-go. 
Add to that an excellent wine list by the glass, red, white and a fabulously dry & flavourful rosé including a knowledgeable server, that's definitely a recipe for success.

Menu is quite eclectic with \"gluten-friendly\" and vegetarian-vegan dishes highlighted.  We opted for the burger with fresh-cut fries (to die for) and the salmon fillet with rhubarb compote on a bed of quinoa with many vegetables. Burger is reported as being very tasty. 
The salmon was excellent, done to perfection but the quinoa was rather dry. Requested some olive oil which came with balsamic vinegar. A little of each resolved the problem. 
My rosé was closer to room temperature and required some ice cubes to chill it down. 
Service was also excellent and attentive. 
Looking forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"Two stars only because the Jerk Chicken sandwich had some redeeming qualities and the atmosphere doesn't suck. We ordered the calamari ($13) which came out under fried and tasteless. We left it to the side of the table and our server did not clear it until we had finished our entire meal. We each had two drinks a piece (and noticed ours were not served on a coaster like everyone else) and those glasses stayed on the table until the end. Water came out without ice and was only half full. The server only served from one half of the table consistently reaching over my girlfriend to serve me (including when presenting the bill and accepting payment via terminal). She must have been having an overall bad day as she would \"drop and run\" when coming to give our table any food or service. The patio is beautiful, the decor inside is great and generally speaking the \"landing\" series of restaurants are very good for service but this visit was lacking. Hopefully the ownership and management doesn't expect something for nothing just by being in a great location."}
{"text":"We went on a fri night and placed reservations for 2 and sat on the patio. We were immediately seated and had a great view of the beach. The nachos were good for 3 people and the whole lobster pasta was prepared the right way according to my gf. However, it did take 20-25 min for the food to arrive and they forgot to include chicken on the nachos. Our server Melissa was definitely attentive and helpful when we brought it up to her attention. I work in the service industry as well so i can appreciate how she handled that situation. 

Would I come back next time?

Yes, I'd like to give this place another chance and try out other things on the menu. Comparable to Joey's or Moxies. It's a bit pricey but try it once to judge for yourself. Tip: make reservations and catch the sunset from the patio."}
{"text":"I'm here on a Sunday night (I have to say it's Carabana weekend so the unbearable noise from the private party on part of the patio may be part of my low review).  But I simply cannot fathom why the service is so slow,  Our first order of drinks (a pint and a bottle) took 20 minutes.  Then our food came - simple burgers and fries.   And an hour after we were first seated, our second drink came.  Long after we had finished our dinner.  I can see 12 empty tables around me, so it's not because it's busy.  This is too bad, as originally I had come here and it was a very enjoyable evening.  Will never come back on a weekend."}
{"text":"Pretty solid new place with a patio that fills a need for one in this area. 

Agree with earlier review about the drinks being pricey for their \"less than a pint, though disguised to look like one\" size. The wheat Hefeweizen type beer I had was refreshing on a warm summer day, and not one I commonly see. If this place had a happy hour or the occasional promo on drinks, I think it would do exceedingly well. 

For eats I had the fish taco appetizer (very good), and an entree salad with beets and fruits - healthy and filling, but not super inventive or original (mostly greens). If the other menu items are similar calibre as the tacos, this place has great potential. 

The attendant in the parking lot (conveniently located directly in front of the entrance) said parking was free with restaurant receipt, so that's a bonus, and kind of subsidizes the high prices of the beers."}
{"text":"Great service, fantastic location and good food. (try the house burger or fish tacos)
Our service was fast and friendly, and the dishes we  had were packed with flavor. I can't comment on the drinks as we just had water."}
{"text":"Great bar bistro!  Open on the Thanksgiving holiday!  Good bar food
  Burgers are the best.  Salads so-so.  Wait staff very polite.  Haven't been called \"Miss\" in a long time.  Good for an extra tip!
  Very nice casual place.  And to top it off it's close to the boardwalk for a little stroll."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate Canada Day with my pal. Since it's new, I suppose the renovation was not fully completed (there was an huge empty space at the entrance). However, Carters' decoration and atmosphere were still very elegant. I really like the direction where the restaurant is going. Keep up the good work.
The servers were very caring & friendly. They are very attentive to our needs & orders. The service itself made the dining experience very delightful. Great job!
Last but not least, we ordered a pound of chicken wings (BBQ). The order comes with a side of coleslaw. I personally really enjoyed the wings - it was very nicely seasoned, and the skin was very crispy even though it was coated with the sauce.

Overall - the dining experience was pleasant. I'll definitely come back this summer to try the other options on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday buffet with a chocolate fountain!
I always sit at the bar and share a burger with the hubby and look out at the water.
Love riding bikes here."}
{"text":"It's not open right now. No idea when it's going to be reopened. They're renovating and there's no listing of this location on the website."}
{"text":"We decided to try this very nicely located restaurant right by the beach. The ambiance is great and service was good. Unfortunately, the food and drinks were terrible! We had the fish tacos, which were dry and tasteless. The edamame was okay, although I think edamame is fine just salted -- Carter's is very peppered as well. We had piña coladas, which were so sweet that we couldn't finish them. We had asked for \"slushy\" drinks (it being a hot day), and this was all they had. Not slushy, just thick, over-sweet juice. The price for two appies and 2 drinks was $57, before tip. We really wanted to love this restaurant, but won't be going back. Fish tacos are much better at Murphy's Law and Lion on the Beach."}
{"text":"After a day at the beach this place was perfect. The drinks are amazing and the food is tasty. Would go back"}
{"text":"Been here more than a few times because quite frankly it's the only restaurant by the boardwalk. But I have to say, despite being in an awesome location with a great patio the customer service is really terrible. 

Last night, my friend and his wife came to visit from out of town so we thought we'd take them here after walking along the boardwalk. 

It took over 15 minutes before we were able to order drinks. When the first round of drinks came, it came after our appetizers. The server didn't smile once, we never got her name. Also, they ran out of lemons which sucked since my friend ordered fish and chips. My wife ordered a piña colada in the beginning, and turns out they ran out of it but they didn't come back to take her until the first round of drinks came so she basically didn't have a drink for over 30 minutes. 

The food itself was okay but the customer service was just terrible. So much waiting and felt like we were being served by someone who hated her job. 

Such a waste of location and patio. It's a shame."}
