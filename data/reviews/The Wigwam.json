{"text":"It's a beautiful hotel, most definitely. The recent renovations are gorgeous and simply wonderful. The grounds are lush and well manicured and the staff was polite, friendly, and very helpful. The rooms were pretty adorable  in terms of the architecture and surrounding areas. They are spacious and comfortable, but the bathrooms are VERY dated. As in, 1970's fantastic here! Funky beige tiles everywhere, dark dingy shower with frosted glass window that really doesn't let much light in. I know they're trying and they're so so close to being amazing in every respect, but the rooms could be improved upon. The pool areas, common areas, poolside bar, and convention areas are gorgeous though!! You instantly feel right at home in these areas and it was beyond pleasurable just hanging out at the hotel! Really perfect for group gathering and family away-time. And did I mention everything is gorgeous?? Because it really is!   Only other negative is that they charge a ridiculous amount for wifi, which is in ADDITION to the daily resort fee, and don't provide complimentary water bottles, which you would think would be a no brainer for a luxury resort in the middle of a desert state."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service. Had the full Wigwam experience here -- Red Door spa services, dinner at Litchfields, and brunch at Red's. The rooms were spacious, clean, and updated, though we spent very little time in the room. We really enjoyed the live music at The Wigwam Bar and the Oasis pool."}
{"text":"The scenery at the wigwam was very elegant and there were plenty of beautiful butterflies around. The wigwam is said to be a \"pet friendly\" resort but that is where the \"friendliness\" stops. We brought our two dogs to the resort and they are extremely well behaved. We received a call that they were incessantly barking in our room and it was bothering our neighbor who was trying to sleep. Mind you it was 4 in the afternoon and still completely light outside.  The security asked us to quiet our dogs but we were 30 minutes away attending a wedding so we politely asked them to call us back if they would not stop and we would come take care of them. They called us back TWO MINUTES later and told us if they had to call us one more time then we would have to speak to a manager. Anyone that has a dog knows that they get excited when someone is making noise around them but they quiet down if given more of a chance than 2 minutes. We were forced to leave the wedding and come back to tend to our dogs. When we got to the hotel, our dogs were not making a sound. We waited outside for over 20 minutes and still never heard one bark. The wigwam forced us to miss a part of our friend's special day. Safe to say I was VERY disappointed with the way they handled the situation and I do not believe this place to be very pet friendly or respectful to pet owners."}
{"text":"What is happening at the Wigwam?  The last couple events I've attended there have left me scratching my head.  The staff are not as graciously friendly as in years past and there are not as many helpful folks around to greet you and direct you.  Getting lost at Wigwam is EASY.  GettIing help is not easy anymore.  The resort is still beautiful and is aging graciously.  I've been visiting the Wigwam for more than 20 years and am delighted it is still here, nestled away in the heart of Litchfield Park.  I want to preface this comment by saying I attend several charity dinners each year at various hotels around the valley.  I have been to events at the Wigwam in the past and have always been amazed by the great service and great food. They've always been a cut above the rest.  This year I have been to two events at Wigwam and both left me a little disappointed.  Last night, however, I was more than disappointed, I left annoyed enough to come here to Yelp and write a review.  We attended a sit down dinner event at the resort last night.  I was astonished in a not good way at several things.  First of all, the temps inside the ballroom were very warm, too warm for mingling around a congested drink station area.  The cash bar was too expensive ($4.75 for bottled water - even in the desert that is ridiculous).  The restrooms were beautiful but oddly lacking in soap dispensers.  Maybe someone stole them?  The worst part of the evening was not only the food but the serving staff.  Dinner was a slab of meat, perhaps sirloin, resting on some broccoli and carrots which were seated on top of a large scoop of potatoes.  All of this was rather thrown in front of the guests by the harried staff.  The servers were abrupt and all business.  No time for discussion of any kind, no time to ask for anything.  When I was able to get my knife through the hide of the beef I realized it was bloody and red - probably cooked to no more than rare inside, although the exterior was seared nearly black.  I am no fan of slabs of beef and even less of a fan of bloody slabs of beef.  After about 5 minutes I was able to attract the attention of our server.  I asked her if I could have my meat cooked \"well done\" and that resulted in my plate being grabbed away from me and the server loudly announcing to another server \"they want this cooked more\" - not nice, not polite and not professional.  While the rest of the guests at my table sawed away at their beef with their dull knives, I waited with napkin in lap for more than 15 minutes while my meat was cooked longer.  When everyone else was done with dinner, a waitress walked throughout the dining room with my plate of food (uncovered, by the way) looking for who it belonged to.  Finally with the aid of my tablemates and their pointing fingers, the plate was delivered, along with this comment \"The cook wants to know if this is done enough for you\" as the plate is tossed in front of me.  I never had a chance to cut into the meat before the waitress was gone for good.  I cut the meat only to find it red inside. There's no way I am going through the shame of asking the staff to have it corrected again!!!    I gave the slab away to another diner who likes bloody meat.  So now, some 20 minutes have gone by and I am going to eat my $60 plate of mashed potato, two carrots which have barely been warmed, have absolutely NO SEASONING, and are covered in meat blood, and two stalks of broccoli which are also not cooked and also not seasoned.  Again with the knives - they were so dull I could not cut the vegetables.  Terrible.  The dessert service was just as bad and the cake was horrible.  It seemed to be a frozen amaretto flavored tiramisu with a dollop of Hershey's chocolate syrup on the plate.  I have had better dessert at Village Inn.  Coffee service was unprofessional as the unpleasant and unhappy waitress had no clue how to serve coffee without making the diners feel like it was a punishment to her.  I left without eating the cake or drinking the coffee.  Not a good meal.  From the reviews on this page, I'd say it might be time for Wigwam to hire a new chef, one who likes to cook things from his/her own recipes and who understands the value of impressing guests at a catered meal or at a lovely brunch.  Our family is staying at the Wigwam for the July 4th weekend and I can only hope that things improve by then."}
{"text":"My family and I went there for Mothers Day brunch and I was very disappointed. The food was decent but nothing to write home about. Especially for $42 bucks a head. The dessert table was awful. Basic tasteless pastries and sprinkle covered marshmallows made to look like cake pops. I was only given one mimosa and our server never came back to ask if we wanted anything else to drink. Our total bill was $134.00 (gratuity incl.) for two adults and a six year old child. Ridiculous! I love the resort and will consider staying for a fun staycation but will go across the street to eat rather than spend my hard earned money for mediocre food...I do not recommend the brunch...obviously."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to 4. They did reach out to me and helped rectify the situation. I'm going to give them another go and won't let one bad experience ruin the potential future fun we have at the Wigwam.   We were there for Easter Brunch yesterday. I thought after a day I would be 'over it' but I am still mad about the whole experience. 1. I called in early April to make my reservation. We went over it a few time, 5 adults and 2 high chairs, for a total of 7. When we were brought to our table yesterday, there were 5 chairs. It then proceeded to take 4 servers and 10 min to figure out how to get us two high chairs. 2. On the phone with the reservation woman, she suggested we sit at 9am, so that we could take our little boys on the Easter egg hunt at 10am. I thought great, we didn't come last year because the boys couldn't walk yet but this year was going to be really exciting - their first egg hunt. WELL, the Easter egg hunt was on SATURDAY, not SUNDAY. So why the hell did she have me schedule our brunch time around an egg hunt that wasn't happening? Not to mention, if I had known it was Saturday - well, we could have brought the boys. 3. When we arrived for Brunch, they were running behind and didn't even seat us at 9am, our reservation time. Probably about 9:10.  4. We had not 1, not 2, but 3 server changes in the first half hour of being there. They were lazy, they never took our plates - I brought dirty plates to a tray I saw set up, they screwed up our drink order of 2 teas and 3 coffees (HOW EASY). Their speech was extremely unprofessional and after dropping off the drinks we hardly saw them again.  5. There was a 20% tax for the piano guy? We couldn't even hear him, we were outside.  6. The food was MEDIOCRE. My prime rib was dry. There were NO egg dishes except 1 person running an omelet stand - which I didn't want to wait 20 min for. How about just a warmer with some scrambled eggs or quiche?? 7.  I was also told if we sat on the patio it would be covered. The umbrellas out there were a joke. We had to drag our own table to try to get most of us in the shade. I explicitly asked when I made the reservation if the patio was covered because we had little ones and elderly in our group.  Overall, I will never return here for Easter Brunch again. Very disappointing. I'm disgusted in what we paid, for this experience."}
{"text":"I haven't actually stayed at this hotel, however, I was planning too stay there in April.  The problem....DOGS!  They do not have separate hotel rooms for people with pets.  So if you have athsma or allergies this probably isn't the place for you.  Deep cleaning a room doesn't rid the room of dander.  They should have select rooms for those with pets.  Not all people like to sleep where animals have slept or maybe a select number of rooms that animals are never allowed in.  So while my friends will be staying at the Wigwam I will have to stay elsewhere."}
{"text":"I do travel and move a lot. I spent a weekend there few months ago with my husband..nice place, check in went smoothly and fast, staff is very nice, rooms are clean.. TV did nt work the first night, however after that they were able to fix it the next day..I liked the location.so many things for the kids to do. We used valet parking which was a little bit expensive, but over all a good place."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Wigwam resort for 3 nights. Each time we called in the front desk, the helper was rude and unprofessional.  To make things worse, I left a pair of hearing aid at the nightstand and when I came back, it was nowhere to be found. We called the front desk and we were told that the housekeeping will be calling us at their convenience. They never called.  In fact, the operator hung up before we finished our call. It appeared to be the same operator during our stay (7/27-29); we usually called late afternoon, the last time was at 8:30 p.m. on 7/29.  The Wigwam maybe wise to better train their phone operator. We would NEVER return to this so called resort."}
{"text":"World Class Entertainment on Saturday Nights!!  In town visiting friends a few weeks ago and found ourselves @ The Wigwam Resort for drinks.  Was pleasantly surprised to discover regular Live Music on Saturday Nights by 2 guys..Larry Keen and Bob Sheade. You never know what to expect anymore but I must say that the \"duo\" were just Great!. Both are first class musicians and Larry especially is one of the Best I have heard in a LONG time. A real Professional.... Vocals Wonderful and Precise, Guitar Playing top notch and Bob does a fantastic job backing him up on keyboards. Larry is one of the true Singer/Songwriters types (i.e. James Taylor, Loggins/Messina, Eagles, Fogelberg, etc) that we all remember from \"back-in-the-day\" and love.  He does great originals as well as all the favorites...60's, 70's, 80's you name it!  If you have a chance to to see theses two guys perform..DON'T miss out!  I will defiantly be back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Was here for a week for work. The resort is okay. It's an old golf resort in the desert, not my cup of tea but it was nice. I had a very nice large shower and wet bar in my room with a patio and outdoor furniture outside. The staff at the bars and that served us our food during the days were EXCELLENT! The food was also very good.   Where my one star comes from is the front desk receptionists, cleaning crews, and security.   On our first day at the resort we were in one of the conference rooms. We were told that we would be back in the same conference room the next day so I left a bunch of work stuff, along with my portable charger and only iPhone cable I had, in the room over night. Upon returning to the room the next morning all of my stuff was there, except my portable charger and iPhone cable. I've worked with and known all of the people in this room for many years, none of them would have taken my charger. In fact many of them offered to loan me there's after I told them the only one I had brought was missing.   I approached the front desk receptionist later that afternoon and told her what happened. She checked in the back and it had not been turned in so she called security. Security was busy so she told me to check back later. I returned again first thing the next morning and explained to a different receptionist what had happened. She had to check with security also and sure enough they were too busy again. She asked for my contact information, I laughed and said \"ma'am my phone is dead, I cannot charge it.\" She phones security again and then comes back to tell me that no one has turned it in. I explain to her how I know everyone that was in that room with me except her employees who were there after my company had left. Her solution was for me to go buy a phone charger at the gift shop.   So my only suggestion is don't leave anything that is small and \"insignificant\" around because their cleaning crews or whoever will have no problem stealing it and the receptionist and security don't care at all."}
{"text":"Beautiful grounds, great help with the wedding i going in. Helped getting wedding party members to and from cars to get ready, and helped getting everything to the Bride and Grooms suit at the end of the night. The  Wedding coordinator we had at the beginning of our day was amazing, the wedding went late so she had another gal come in for the later part of the reception, no big deal it ended at 10-11ish and we started at like 8 am. But the Second Gal she had come in and said hi and disappeared for a while, I had the job of finding her so the Bide and her groom could get set to end the day. 45 mins later , Found her at one point eating the food from the reception during the reception, at the time the bride was NOT OK with since we had been trying to find her. She finally showed  and tried to tell me oh we don't don't a, b or c, In the contract for the wedding a,b, and c were in there and when it was to happen and why, Thank god for Gentleman who i believe was Security( was in a nice suit and had a Wigwam tag on) he called a bell boy had him take care of moving things to the room and were supposed to be moved, The bell boy even went and got the suitcase's that had not been picked up yet from the wedding party room. On my way out(@ 12:15am) I went out the front and my car was near the back with the room, Thank god for the guy with the golf cart, dropped me right at my car door so sweet, Thank you."}
{"text":"Went to the beer bacon and Bbq festival and it was horrible! Last year we had so much fun, there were a bunch of different local beer vendors and food options. This year it was a third of the size, food was more expensive and I didn't see one person with a smile on their face. Very disappointed! We will not return next year."}
{"text":"We came to AZ because my son was playing in the USA Baseball tournament. With the fields scattered throughout the metro Phoenix area, location was very important to us. We used Booking.com because that method provided the best rate. Little did I know that this third party would have to be involved in any changes I would need to make to my reservations. More on that later.   We looked online and saw pictures of the accommodations and chose the queen room and checked out the floor plan online. We were surprised when we got in our room that the layout was different. The important difference is that the bathroom has an open floor plan, meaning that everything is in one room. That means that, for most instances, only one person can use the bathroom at a time. There is no door separating the commode, as pictured in the floor plan. My daughter is not really comfortable watching my son brush his teeth while she is going to the bathroom. Not good. The bathroom itself was very clean, and big. The shower was spacious. D+ (because of the layout and online misinformation)  The beds were comfortable, with lots of pillows. No fitted sheets, though. I ordered a tool away bed, and it was delivered very fast. The only problem I had with it is that is was a child's bed, about 5'6\" long, and my feet hung over the end. B+  The location was convenient, located between Dysart and Old Litchfield, a couple miles north of the 10. Quiet neighborhood, very safe. Albertsons and gas station located very close in a little shopping center nearby. A+  My room was located on the second floor which can only be reached by climbing the winding staircase. No elevators. Pity. My suitcases were friggin' heavy! F  The TV in the room was a flat screen, but old. The only inputs on it were RCA's, which is a dead giveaway of its age. There was no way to connect my Amazon FireStick, Apple TV, or PS4. Your only option is to watch cable. Who does that anymore? I should have brought my VCR (my bad). The room had a mini refrigerator. It was old and kept food and drinks cool, not cold. The room was conspicuously missing a microwave, which, for the price, should have been there. D  The staff was very friendly helpful. The only hiccup was when we tried to leave a day early. Then we got the runaround. We spoke to the hotel operator twice, once got routed to the reservations desk, only to get rerouted to the front desk. Then the people I needed to speak with were in a meeting. Oh, and we were told to call Booking.com because we made the reservation through them, so they had to approve it. We called Booking.com, they put us on hold because they had to get permission from Wigwam to waive the $125 fee (\"It's OK with us, if it's OK with them.\"). After waiting for 10 minutes while the rep from Booking.com got bounced around and put on hold, he came back and told us that we had to speak to in house reservations and that only they can waive the fee. After sitting on hold, and calling back again to speak to a human being, we were rolled into a voicemail queue. We decided to walk down and speak to a human being face to face. So, we walked down and were warmly greeted at the front desk. They are really nice people, but once I explained everything I was told, \"Oh, the fee is hotel policy, and we never waive it.\" Nice. They should have led with that in the first place. We ended up staying because they would not waive the fee. Anyway, the wait staff by the pool were excellent. There are people in golf carts everywhere, and they are very helpful. B+  The food was excellent (room service). My wife and daughter ordered Beef Tacos, Filet Mignon, and Chocolate Mouse Pie. She raved about it, and knows good food when it crosses her pallet. My daughter ordered several smoothies, and loved them all. The bartenders made them and were very hospitable. A+  Parking was ample, although most were located by the main entrance. A  There are two pools, both on the small size, considering the number of guests and the hot weather. The water was very warm (it was 117 degrees out), and I can't understand why the pool was not equipped with a cooling device. Plenty of chair and towels were available. Cabanas cost extra. THERE ARE NO LAUNDRY FACILITIES. It is important to note that this is primarily a golf resort. Oh, by the way, you will be charged a $25 resort fee per day, not including golf fees. B+  Overall, while not a bad place to stay, there are better places to stay in the metro Phoenix area that provide much better value for the dollar. I will not stay here again because I can have a better stay elsewhere for a lot less."}
{"text":"So I found the Wigwam on a groupon and as it was the wife and I's anniversary it looked pretty good considering it had the golf resort, adult pool, bars, etc.  I can say I was not disappointed in the least.  From the extremely large size of our \"Oasis\" room to the customer service, porters, etc. I was extremely impressed.  The resort is a little but older admittedly but it has been renovated and seems very well cared for.  I will definitely stay again my next trip down."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing.  They surprise you with a daily $20 resort fee  plus taxes to park and use the internet.  The room was nice, comfortable bed, but it took 2 days to get hot water for a shower (was lukewarm), no tv guide-only channels, and no one knew how to set the clock alarm???  The bar happy hour food was very over priced for taste and portion.  I was so excited to stay at a resort cheaper than the local Holiday Inn, but it was more disappointing than a Holiday Inn.  The front desk clerk had no desire to handled any of my concerns.  NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Never again.  The only reason I give it two stars is the fact that the service staff was wonderful.  The front desk staff was condescending and totally unaccomodating and could care less about your business.  Stuck my family in upstairs room, right by all the noisy restaurants, sinks were backed up, faucet broke, air conditioning broke, never got the microwave I requested weeks prior to arriving.  The front desk has no customer service skills after you check-in.  We stayed for 8 nights although our original reservation was for 9 nights.  They charged for the 9th night anyway because that's what I agreed to.  No one told me at check-in about early penalty.  There were other issues too and also have friends who had similar struggles with front desk staff.  My advise, stay away.  There are plenty of other hotels to choose from in the local area.  Hotels that don't nickel and dime you and penalize you for checking out one night early.  I guess they need to collect all the money they can to repair the rooms!"}
{"text":"Good hotel. Recommend this place to anyone who loves beer and to chill. #goodplace and also one thing that got me triggered was that you had to pay for the gosh darn water it was 5$ per water smh. s/o to yung chop R. I.  P Deja'neke"}
{"text":"Thank you to Kellyn -the reservations manger. It was my first time there and she was very helpful in making my reservations and explaining room choices. Even though there was a small hiccup at check in desk, she immediately came out to personally resolve  it. I appreciate her excellent customer service.  7/14/17."}
{"text":"Very simple...   -Big Rooms (Adobe Traditional) -Great Golf -Amazing food -Quiet!!!! -Pools are superb -Friendly Staff  Really, what more do you want? Look every so often, someone has a bad experience. There are things that really shouldn't F up your vacation. Old TVs, Outdated furniture, Price of drinks and food, etc shouldn't keep you from enjoying yourself. The bar is exactly that, a bar. Don't expect waiters/waitresses, it's not how it works. If you want to be served hand and foot go to the restaurants. I will frequent here (especially in May when school is still on) because it's all that you can ask for from an inexpensive resort."}
{"text":"I am writing this review from my wife's account.  My family has stayed at this resort for 4 generations.  I had fond memories of this place as a child, and brought my wife and son here in hopes they'd have fond memories as well.  What a disappointment.  The hotel is poorly staffed, and at every turn there was bad service.  We sat at the Red bar and grill and ate our entire buffet without a single waiter asking for our drink order or checking on us.   We had to search for someone in order to pay.  The main restaurant didn't even open before dinner.   A room service tray stayed outside our room for 2 days.  But the worst...the absolute worst part was the fact that they made a booking mistake and put me, my heavily pregnant wife and 2 year old out on the street at peak rush hour traffic to try to find a new place to stay.  We extended our stay for 2 days due to car trouble, but the front desk screwed up and only booked one.  On the second day we get a phone call saying we have been locked out due to \"late check out\" and the hotel is fully booked.  On a Tuesday in late February.  We were shocked and in disbelief.  We actually believe this was a lie and the staff deliberately decided to be \"booked\" when we got upset at the lockout and booking error.  The place just isn't that crowded.  We had been there for 4 days.  I have many other small complaints about our stay but I've said enough.   Please do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere.  No one cares about you here!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised this place has such high ratings. The room I stayed in was very dated. The bathroom was dark and funky. Internet did not work the first day. The clerk at the pro shop was very rude, and we never saw the refreshment cart. The restaurant/bar near the pool seemed understaffed. The people working were doing their best, though. There is no lobby shop so if you forget something you are out of luck. There is no minibar or snacks in the room. Just weird almonds, H2O and coffee. If you want a diet Coke you will be disappointed. There are no vending machines, either. Room service didn't answer, and I tried for an hour. The front desk clerk offered to call on my behalf. I followed up with room service myself and over the course of an hour had no success. This place looks good on the outside but there seem to be systemic issues that are beyond the abilities/responsibilities of the customer-facing employees. It's like a fancy prison. I feel like Tantalus. And I'm hungry."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for a day pass by the pool. Not even 5 minutes in the manager approached us to go to the other \"adult pool\" basically because someone complained about my bathing suit bottoms. Mind you I was wearing cheeky bottoms from TARGET. We were pretty much forced to leave to the adult pool, which was closed off and hot with no breeze. We ended up leaving and are awaiting a refund."}
{"text":"We have stayed a few times at the Wigwam and always have excellent service.  We like the elegant rooms and gorgeous lawns and flowers.  We ate for our anniversary in the Arizona Kitchen and liked the southwest flavors and open room.  We just heard about a new steakhouse they are building that will be steaks plus pool tables and a place to relax too."}
{"text":"We had an early flight and arrived at the Wigwam resort before noon. We were heading to the 49er/cardinals game. To our surprise we were able to check in early, and also told that they had a free shuttle that could drop us of at the game. I was thankful that we had our room to freshen up before the game. The rooms are a little dated, and one of our patio chairs was completely broken.  After the game we headed back to enjoy the lovely pool. All in all it was a quick, but nice stay."}
{"text":"My husband and I are checking out today after spending the weekend here. We have been so pleased with everything from the large size of our room and bathroom, to the beautiful pools with water slides for our kids. The staff has been everything that is courteous and indulgent. The atmosphere here at night is also very pleasant and upscale. At poolside last night we were treated to live guitar music and singing from the Wigwam Bar area. To top it off we just finished a delicious breakfast served to us outside at the same bar. We have never received our food so promptly, we had settled in for a long wait and were pleasantly surprised. Stay here, you will love it!"}
{"text":"I stayed at this resort for business.  The LM site was just down the street in Goodyear, AZ.  I have to say, this place was better than I expected.    First, I came with a group of 8 people.  They were able to accommodate us & have our rooms near each other.  The front desk also took note that I had services booked at the Red Door Day Spa (which is on the resort) & upgraded our rooms to be on the fairway.  This way, I was near the spa when I had my services.  The resort itself is well manicured and the people are GREAT!  Anything we needed, they were right there.  The amenities were fabulous as well.  There were 9 tennis courts, a fitness center, 2 great restaurants, & a kick butt pool area!  I have to say, the pool was my fave.  Especially since the weather was ~108 everyday that I was there.  I also ate at the Arizona Grill and Grill on the Greens on the resort.  The food was really good but on the pricey side.  There was nothing really \"Arizona\" about it, just good food.  What I thought was pretty neat was the history that surrounded the Wigwam Golf Club.  Apparently, its a hot spot for avid golfers.    The gripes:  It looked like nothing was upgraded.  I know this place has a lot of history, but I like things upgraded.  Some people appreciated the originality, which is fine w/ me!  Also, the food was pretty pricey.  THE SPA!!!!  I'll review the spa separately because of the fiasco I had there."}
{"text":"This resort is a gem. Friendly and helpful staff, impeccable grounds, renovated and very spacious rooms. The golf course is beautiful. Will definitely return for all future visits to central AZ."}
{"text":"Living in Litchfield is amazing! The Wigwam is the perfect place to unwind with great company and awesome service.  The staff in the Wigwam bar is established and a couple of them have been there for 14 plus years.  Katy, Jacky, Sandra, Melody always make the Wigwam experience more personalized as they get to know the regulars.  The live music is an adds to the experience. Only area of growth would be to have the Friday entertainment update her set. The same music is played every Friday in almost the same order with no changes. She is a great artist but her songs are repetitive and have little variation."}
{"text":"This may not be the most expensive resort in Phoenix, but I think it is my favorite!  It has more charm and personality than the larger, more well known corporate resorts.  This is the best value for your $ in the Phoenix Valley!  The service was phenomenal and the food at all the restaurants and thru room service is great.  There are plenty of activities for children, and opportunities for quiet romance too.    Some of the rooms have a microwave and small fridge, but I believe most do not.  Last year I stayed in a room that did.  This year I was in the Oasis area which was lovely.  We had a large terrace overlooking the pool with a beautiful large soaking tub in bathroom.  The Wigwam continues to be my favorite staycation resort!"}
{"text":"I recently stayed here on a military trip to Luke afb.  The room was huge and very comfortable, the staff was superb and the facilities are top notch.  I will definitely come here again.  The only complaint is that the bartender was from New York and a Yankee fan.   Being from boston originally, the wigwam should make her change to a Red Sox fan."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at Wigwam. Huge party kept us & kids up for hours, finally they kicked then out after 5 other complaints. WiFi in the room was weak and unusable. Pool wasn't open during the specified hours which led to disappointed kids. The pool is really nice and kid friendly that was the best part. Very hard place to navigate, we were  lost upon arrival and were offered no help finding the room. Got locked out of the room and security arrived with shampoo, when asked about keys we received a blank stare. All in all our trip was a disaster, won't be returning. They did credit us $100 off the stay so bumped the review to 2 stars."}
{"text":"I love how relaxed this resort is and customer service is great. My only issue was with the hotel room housekeeping - it was obvious the bathroom floor had not been cleaned due to the marks and clumps of hair on the floor. Plus, there was old pizza left in the refrigerator. Other than that, our stay was great."}
{"text":"Appears to be family friendly but really isn't.   Nice location, very good rooms and a fun pool for the kids but a management that was essentially unwilling to enforce basic civil behavior. An outdoor party with music so loud in the main courtyard surrounded by rooms that went on till 10:15 pm.  The clincher? An obviously drunk guest who got a hold of the microphone and kept using horrific profanity ridden language screaming over the loud music. An f bomb followed by an MF bomb, yeah that bad. But wait it gets better, despite repeated calls to the front desk and assurances that security was on its way I was told that it is the guest's free will to say whatever he wished!! Can't even fathom saying that to a family with small kids having to listen to that.   Sticking with the Phoenician next time."}
{"text":"I really can't think of how they could improve the place.  It is what it is.  A classy, old school resort that makes you feel like you are vacationing like your grandparents did.  Beautiful southwest style lobby and furniture everywhere.  Landscaping was perfect.   Every room is a casita that seems to invite company and drinks.  The place is made for socializing.  I had a great time here for a few days for a work conference. Food was excellent and the staff always asked if you needed help with anything.  Huge recreational facilities that included pools, workout rooms, and (gasp) 3 18 hole golf courses."}
{"text":"A sequence of many errors, and lots of \"new\" staff made this weekend not very enjoyable. I booked my reservation directly with the hotel and booked 2 upgraded suites for my family. I looked at the floor plans on the website, and asked questions to the reservation agent. We were traveling with a toddler, and needed a quiet room with a bath tub. Upon arrival, we were given a room right next to the check-in roundabout and bell desk- not quiet. So, second room offered was  \"much up-graded suite near the pool\" but with a $45 upgrade fee. The room was right off the tower pool. The building has peeling paint, old windows, and NO bath tub. The music by the pool is loud and lasts until 10pm. So... Room 3 was an oasis suite. Very nice. Very quiet. In the morning we wanted to take advantage of the balcony and have room service breakfast. 50 Minnie's after ordering, we had food arrive. The attendant put the tray on the table and stood there waiting for gratuity. The tray had no water, no cups for the coffee, and missing pet of the order. So, he left to get the rest, and returned 25 minutes later with no coffee cups, no water, but an English muffin and a plate. No apology was made for the amount of time it took, or the incomplete order. The food was decent, but the coffee was terrible. Oasis poolside was nice. Server told us the bartender wasn't good, so not to order any mixed drinks.:: We stayed and had dinner at Litchfield's restaurant. This was a very nice dining experience. Good food, great wine list, good service. Outside saying was very nice."}
{"text":"Relaxing getaway with comfort and charm. This resort captivated me as a child and still does, 20 something years later. Set in the tranquil environment of Litchfield Park, it is great for those visiting AZ as well as those needing a staycation. Whether you are into golfing, spa days, or want a day by the pool with food and drink, the resort has plenty of amenities. The privacy of the rooms, the uniqueness of the decor and the scrumptiousness of the bed/bedding make it worth it too! Walking through the front, you are visually greeted with pictures showing the transformation of the Wigwam over the years. It is full of culture and everyone you meet seems to take special pride/care in making your experience there a wonderful one. During a special week long conference we brought our small dog with us and even the housecleaning staff was so kind to him, asking if we would like him walked during the day. I urge you to see for yourself what I consider one of the best kept secrets of the west valley."}
{"text":"We stayed for a week and enjoyed every minute of it  We stayed in mid August. We arrived super late from New York on a Saturday and there was five of us in total.  We were checked in promptly by a super nice gentleman and taken to our rooms.  It was a little tricky to navigate in the dark but we made it.  Our stay was super comfortable, the staff was so very nice and polite.  We shall return within the year as we had a fantastic experience.  The pool, the fitness room and the kids camp were great amenities.  I would recommend to many friends.  Great little town nearby in Goodyear also close to Scottsdale and a day's trip to the Grand Canyon. Can't wait to return Also pet friendly which is a plus  I personally would prefer healthier menu choices but overall that's a minor detail  We had a really great experience"}
{"text":"Was not expecting such a nice layout of both the facility and the room.  The staff was extremely polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Fantastic resort! We have made this our family's reunion spot for Thanksgiving - nothing compares to the wonderful service and comfortable rooms. Most outstanding is Barbara the concierge- gracious and helpful - she makes co-ordinating activities for people coming in from all over the States  very easy. Big thanks Wigwam!"}
{"text":"I came here for a conference and wasn't overly impressed with the resort. It does have a nostalgic feel of the old west but there are some details that have been overlooked. My room was pretty old and had that musty smell, which is less than appealing at a resort like this.  My room seemed to have some stained towels and pillows while the shampoo seemed to have been partially used prior to my arrival. The other thing that is quite odd is that when I booked this hotel I was required to pay a deposit i.e. my room rate. For a four star resort this struck me as very odd. The staff was attentive, helpful and friendly.  Probably wouldn't stay here again.  I think there are enough other resorts in Phoenix to choose from."}
{"text":"The pool was dirty, and you can't see underwater with goggles. The waterslides are dangerousluly fast and I banged my head on the final turn on the open one while I was lying on my back. Same thing with the closed water slide..There's even more about the water slides. When you get there, you check in at 4PM, and you find your room. The room isn't TERRIBLE, it's just that I thought they could do better. There wasnt a lock on the door to the bathroom, there was only a lock to the ENTIRE bathroom and closet. After you get to your room and settle, you decide to go to the pool. You get to the pool at 5PM. You find a seat. Its 5:15. The water slides close AT 6:00PM! You hardly get time to ride the water slides. I only got to ride the waterslides 3 times. Not 3 times each. I expected better of this \"resort\", my family won't be coming back here for vacation for a LOOOOOOOOONG time. I hope this review helps you decide if you want to visit Wigwam. Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"My only complaint is the \"patio fee\", which seems like a scam because I did not see a single unit without a patio ! I also had a hard time staying connected to the internet and spent too much time trying to log back in. Otherwise, I loved the quiet , clean, spacious room with wet bar and fridge, and the very family friendly as well as pretty grounds and  pools. The pool area is big enough to be exciting, but small enough to be charming. Beautiful historic lobby is worth taking time to carefully explore. Really a very lovely place; relaxing and fun for a family."}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL!!  Had a few issues with our room (to NO fault of the hotel), smoke alarm chirped because battery was dying, they were out to fix it in less than 2 minutes.  Then the next night we tried getting in the room, key wouldn't swipe, had new keys made, didn't work...that's when we noticed the lights didn't even show on it (red for error).  Front desk had maintenance out before we even got back to the room (we were only a few steps away), the worker verified the name registered to the room and checked id...we were thrilled that he did this (means our safety and our items are also safe!!!)  Like I said..these issues were totally out of anyone's control (unless you have esp and can predict a battery is dying).  Grounds were gorgeous, all staff extremely friendly, and their food is AMAZING.  Small play area for the kiddos, as well as two pools.  One pool has a water slide, and they bring pitchers of ice water to where you are sitting!!!  LOVE THIS PLACE.  Worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"**Absolutely hot garbage and overrated**   Please spend your hard earned money elsewhere.  My room smelled like cat urine and the sinks and shower were slow draining, great place if you like cold showers in the morning time.    **I would rather stay in a Marriot Courtyard any day of the week.**"}
{"text":"I just stayed at the Wigwam resort, what a treat, beautiful grounds, clean spacious and updated rooms and friendly staff. We arrived to an easy friendly check-in, we were delighted with the spacious clean beautiful room with a back patio we loved.   The pool was great, clean, big, fun and  the poolside service was great - and priced for food and drink were very reasonable. I love a beer or margarita by the pool, but love the $6 price vs. many resorts that get you for $12-$15. And, they are so nice and friendly.  We strolled the grounds and heard music, and were delighted to find a live band outside the Wigwam bar. Great for families and singles. Love the food, drink and band.  Everything was delightful, I usually do not review, but this is the best resort for beauty, friendliness and value. I will recommend the Wigwam resort over and over."}
{"text":"We were there for Happy Hour this weekend. The food and drinks were good, however our service was terrible! Mitzi was rude and acted output having to serve us. She was also mia a lot. Put a damper on our night. Sad."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at The Wigwam on New Year's Eve 2017.  We were upgraded to a suite.  The suite was clean, large, nicely decorated, and the bed was very comfortable.  We had dinner at Litchfield's. The food was awesome. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I come to this place every year for summer and this time I was very disappointed first there is dead cockroach in my bathroom they're spider webs and spiders everywhere the sheets are all dirty and the worst part about it is we reserved a cabana for a specific day and they said we did not have any reservations for that day so I don't know what's going on with this place but me and my family are very disappointed"}
{"text":"I decided to book this place due to the fact that it was close to camelback ranch where the dodgers spring training is taking place. The resort looks beautiful on their website. We traveled from Valencia CA to here driving! When we came up to the resort the grounds looked nice and the people who welcomed us were very nice as well. The receptionist seemed very neutral. Not the A+ customer service I expected based on the amount of money we spent on the room. Any way, we parked our car, grabbed our bags and walked into our room. Upon entering the room it smelled very musty and dirty. The bathrooms were outdated. The kitchen didn't even have a microwave. Very small awkward kitchen. When we went to bed that night we could not sleep. The mattress was the worst I mean worst mattress I have ever slept on. Very old or super cheap mattress. So think about it. We were sleeping in a dirty, musty, room with a mattress that felt like I was sleep on a lob sided mountain. We did call the front office. They replaced the mattress but same issue. We spent a lot of money here. I wish it was better for what we payed. Next years spring training will not be spent at the wigwam."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Wigwam for 4 days in one of their \"Adobe Traditional Suites\". I booked the hotel through hotels.com and paid $100 per night. When I got to the resort, I was stunned at how well maintained the facility looked. There was some construction going on near the receptionist desk but everything else was spotless.  The receptionist was very friendly and let me know all the facilities that I could take advantage of and gave me a map with directions on how to get to the room (the resort is very large). Once I got to the room, I was amazed at the size of the room, all of its amenities and how inexpensive it was compared to other hotels I have stayed at in the past. The room consisted of a queen sized bed, the bed was very well made with close to 10 pillows on it and a small blanket that was made to look like a bow on the corner of the bed. The room also had a recliner, and a large desk. The bathroom had a stand up shower and a bath tub. The complimentary bathroom products included shampoo, conditioner, bar soap, shower gel, body lotion, and q-tips. The room also included a patio that had two lawn chairs, a table and a lounge chair for your use. I was saddened that I did not have any free time to check out everything the hotel had to offer but again, for $100, the room was worth every penny.  Subsequently, I went onto the Wigwam's website to try and book a room and I saw that the rates were going from double to triple what I paid. I doubt I will find a rate like that any time soon for the place but always shop around for the best price."}
{"text":"Sheeeeeiiiiit- to paraphrase dem boyz Kris kross (RIP Kris), wig-wam is wiggidy wack! Like straight booty wack  First off, this location is horrible. Only go here as an alternative to hospice. My granny be in a. Rising home in ATL that's more happening this this piece  Next they property layout. It's like the property designer wanted to mimic the suburban sprawl of Phoenix but on a (slightly) smaller scale. Building numbers have no relationship to room numbers. The lady at the front desk tell me I'm mm 367. So I'm like, building three right. She's all, \"nah T. Building 8\". Wtf?? Plus she gave me some f ed up durations   Anyway, you boy did get bit turned around. Maybe it was the bad directions or maybe the Hennessy but took me damn near 20 mins to find my joint. What a broke ass room. Thought I rolled in the trap by mistake. Straight 90:s. Stains all up the bed and the tile on the nasty counter. AC was weak and louder than the twin 16s in my trunk! And, no minibar in the joint. How I supposed to get lit now?  Whatva. Just popped a few Xans and was out. Woke up. Hit gym which was actually real tight. I ain't play tennis but they had some serious courts. I was hoping my girl Serena would be our stretching that fine booty. But nah, just some old broke housewives. Oh well. Everyday we wake up we winnin?? Maybe not this one."}
{"text":"We've been here 7 days now with two left.  It's impeccably clean, furnished with big beautiful comfortable pieces.  The room is spacious with very cozy couch and chair.  The lodge/pool/bar/restaurant/entertainment area is invitingly warm in decor but kept cool in this desert heat.  The biggest plus is the service.  Quick, seemingly genuine friendliness.   Every worker I've passed has greeted me.   The food has been surprisingly healthy and very tasty.  For that I'm really thankful because we've been able to  eat every meal here at the resort making our stay easy.  I love that they use Tazo chai as I'm addicted to my very specific Tazo chai lattes.  Only one thing they're missing for long stays....a washer and dryer.  I'm not going to pay their laundering prices, I could buy all new clothes by the time I paid for each piece laundered.  My kid is here playing ball.  I gotta wash that uniform every day.  I have to go sit in a laundromat when I'd really rather be by the pool or bar waiting for my loads to process.  Plus one of the laundrymats I went to was a really sketchy neighborhood.  I've been in a lot of hotels and resorts.  This is the only one I've ever been in that didn't have a least one washer dryer shoved in a corner somewhere.  But this place is very worth staying at.    Overall,  my son and I are very happy here."}
{"text":"We stayed here last year for the 4th of July.  Wonderful!  We are booked for 2016 and hope to make this an annual ritual.  2015, ordered room service for breakfast.  Everything we ordered was excellent.  We didn't hit the water slide pool, but did spend time at the pool for adults only.  Lovely area, quiet, clean, comfortable.  Front desk check in staff were busy, but professional and courteous.  When checking in they escort you by golf cart to a parking spot near your casita.  Great experience over all.  Try it, you can't go wrong for the price on summer rates!   Pet Friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent vacation!  I still dream about sitting at the fire pit with a glass of wine!"}
{"text":"TO WIGWAM OR NOT TO WIGWAM... STAY HOME! My son is getting married, so I thought to throw my new daughter in law a bridal shower at REDS GRILL at the Wigwam Resort in Litchfield Park. We have not gone there in a few years and I thought it would be a lovely place to hold it. It was close and conveniently located.  Unfortunately that is where it ended. Close and convenient. Not only was the service unacceptable, but it was dirty from the moment you walked into the restaurant. The entry way was filled with leaves and dirt that blew in from the front door, and remained that way the entire time we were there. By the end of the afternoon, I was ready to get a broom and start sweeping it up myself. I was horrified that no one thought to sweep it up considering most of the staff had plenty of time to sit and chat by the soda machine in the back. More so, when I entered the private room we had reserved, dead flies coffined in old dust filled crevices were hidden behind all the wood shutters that appeared to have been there for quite some time.   When it was time to order, there were no menus because they were not printed up and ready to go for our pre ordered four meal selection. And after all the ladies did order their meals, the menu's remained and were never picked up.   Most everyone ordered Southwestern Salads, I got a burger and my son ordered a turkey club. My burger was filled with so much liquid smoke (of which was not stated on the menu,) I couldn't eat it; and you could get a better turkey club at fry's deli. This was a very easy crowd of women. Four meals to choose from, a drink and a Sprinkles cupcake for dessert. Easy!   After we finished lunch, it was gift giving time, but the only gift that kept on giving was the non-service of the staff of three in an empty fifthly restaurant. The mother of the bride and myself had to clear the table ourselves as there was no one in sight to pick up the empty glasses and used plates that were pushed aside.  Let me finish by saying, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. When I was trying to book this party of 15 originally, I had to chase the Manager and the Catering Manager down for my business. Trying to get a call back and confirmation for this party was extremely stressful. I should have gone somewhere else, but chose not to. So Shame on Me. I did ask my son at one point why we stopped going to The Wigwam. He said, because of the service, remember?"}
{"text":"I had posted a pretty negative review concerning the customer service here, as well as a list of unfortunate circumstances. However, the General Manager (Katy Powers) was very responsive and gracious. In light of this, I have removed the laundry list. Is this place beautiful? Absolutely. Would I stay here again? Not sure. I would however, consider it. If you are planning a large party here, that part of the stay was excellent. I will end things there, as I too would like to be gracious."}
{"text":"Stayed here a few nights last week and the grounds are amazing! The pool was really nice and relaxing, just a great time to unwind.  They guys golfed both days and enjoyed it.  Food was super.  The only complaint I have is my friend and I got pedi's at the spa for (172$) for both of us.  It was exactly a one hour treatment with a half ass massage and one of the nail ladies with short hair was actually rude!!! Other then that great trip."}
{"text":"My wife and I planned to spend a day at the Spa for my birthday today, she booked a couple of massages and we were told we could have lunch and drinks by the pool... when we got there we were walked to the changing rooms and left to figure everything out on our own... luckily after walking around aimlessly another guest let us know where the robes were and how to use the lockers. Our massages were great... so that was nice.... afterward we were excited to hang by the pool (we couldn't get in cause the heater is broken) and maybe grab a bite and some drinks... but again... we walked around aimlessly... we decided maybe the girl (Adrianna) at the desk in the changing room was there for more than just looking pretty... we asked her how and where we could order something... she was so rude and short... and handed us a tiny menu and said \"but I will need a card or something\" ummmm ok? We weren't interested in a beer or margarita so she pretty much told us we were shit out of luck... we decided to leave and try to find the restaurant on site... we shared our experience with the lady up front who said... \"oh, I can give you a day pass to come back and enjoy the pool area and spa and you can find lunch and drinks across the street, sorry we are short handed today\" .... well... considering we are leaving because they were impossible to enjoy, I think we will pass. This is so disappointing as we just moved to Verrado and were hoping to find our new spa.. I guess we will be taking the hike down to the Tapatio Cliffs where we can enjoy our time for the amount of money we spend getting massages etc..."}
{"text":"The staff is simply amazing. All of them. We stayed there for a conference and it was good fun. The food is really good. Because they have an array of smoothies, juices and salads without forgetting their incredible guacamole, I managed not to completely smash my diet! The rooms are clean but with a tendancy to mold. The fitness area is FANTASTIC with a motion studio featuring all necessary equipments for yoga. The fact there are 2 pools - one for kids and one for adults -  is definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"Wow! I am a four seasons girl but had to stay here as it was close to my boyfriend's out of town work. From pictures and reviews, I prepared myself for a dismal hotel. Definitely not! We stayed in a beautiful suite. The resort is huge with two pools and beautiful grounds. It takes a lot to impress me and I am impressed. Plus, everyone was super nice, helpful, and attentive. The only thing I would suggest would be more signage (I got lost a few times) and a little coffee shop. Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful venue and to say a 'find' in the desert is an understatement.  The staffing as well as amenities were exceptional.  If one is wanting to relax and be pampered with non-stop service - this is the place."}
{"text":"My company held a post golf outing and Welcome Reception for a conference group. We had it on a green under the Teepee. Everything about this event was fantastic; the golf pro's participation, the catering and audio visual teams input and efforts, the unique menu and even the pricing was most reasonable.  Allison exceeded my expectations and the event was a huge success. Best of all, we all watched the fiery sunset together!"}
{"text":"This was a great stay cation!!  First off it was a great deal!  The staff was wonderful and wen out of thier way to make sure we had everything we needed. Rooms are clean and big. And ours was right by the pool.  It is on the older side for a resort but it has some great character too. The bar was great, drinks were on point.  We made smores over the fire on our table.  Pool was awesome.  We will be back"}
{"text":"This is classic desert resort at its best.  Mellow and yet with full amenities.  I stayed in the \"Oasis\" area on the 2nd floor--not a casita--but really liked it.  It was quiet and had a beautiful deck overlooking the Oasis pool area.    Karen at the front desk was terrific too.    Only criticisms were 1) the lack of readily available info on the fitness classes held which I would have liked to have gone to if I had known 2) the water slide at the second (main) pool was out of service.  Internet is now included as part of the $18 resort fee.  I would stay there again."}
{"text":"I am 6 days into a 10 night stay. I came to AZ from San Diego to help my Father, a long-time Litchfield Park Resident (and former Mayor) arrange my Mother's funeral. It seems as though in my absence the resort has begun attracting a clientele closer to Eddie Griswold than Clark Griswold. I was expecting some commotion over the Fourth of July Holiday but was not prepared for SUVs blocking disabled parking spaces, MAGA chants and hoards of unattended teenagers in all common areas of the resort day and night.  From the pools to the walkways & lawns every moment spent outside our room has been like an unruly homeroom class. I chose the Wigwam for its secluded location within the quiet and classy Litchfield Park neighborhood, but have been thoroughly disappointed that the ambiance is more frat house than quiet and healing summer retreat. I'm quite embarrassed to have booked an additional 9 rooms (2+ nts ea) for out-of-town family this coming weekend."}
{"text":"just got married here, and it was wonderful.  From the event planning, to the restaurants, to the catering staff, the rooms and the grounds themselves the Wigwam is wonderful.  Allison the coordinator is so helpful, very quick to get back with answers to questions and runs the actual big day perfectly.  The catering staff is excellent, glasses were always full, and the entire party seemed to be served at exactly the same time.  Justin the banquet captain deserves praise specifically.    The resort itself is very unexpected, we live very close by but as soon as you are through the gates you wouldn't even believe you were in Phoenix, it is so green and calm that it seems like a completely different state.  The pools are super clean and the water slide is even more fun than you'd expect.  The rooms are massive, and not over crowded with furniture.  Seems like a lot of hotels just pack small rooms with too many pieces of furniture, the Wigwam has huge rooms and plenty of floor space so that you do not feel like you will walk in to something all the time.  The suites are huge, I'd have to guess we were pretty close to 1000 sq ft, not including the two balconies.  If it had been colder maybe we would have started a fire in the two fireplaces!    An absolutely wonderful experience in every single way...and I'll be honest, not nearly as expensive as I would have guessed....real value for a wonderful wedding, let's hope the marriage is as good :)"}
{"text":"My family and I were so looking forward to having Easter Brunch at your resort.  Our family consists of 4 adults and two children so this was a simple party of 6.  I was looking for an experience that was relaxing and enjoyable.  I must share with you that our experience at The Wigwam was extremely disappointing and embarrassing.  Our reservation was for 1:30 pm and we arrived promptly at 12:35 pm only to find an extensive line in order to get into the ballroom.  Then when we arrived at the front of the line after waiting for 40 minutes-- we were directed to get out of the line and return to the end of the line because it was only 1:20 pm.  The customer service was extremely poor to say the least.  The female who was taking names at the front counter failed to even take my name and I had to get someone else to assist me.  I explained to her that I would not return to the end of the line after already waiting 40 minutes.  She then directed me to wait off to the side where we were herded alongside three other groups of families who had been treated in the same manner.   The experience made me feel like I was not a valued customer.  We then proceeded to wait another 25 minutes before we were seated in the ballroom.  The entire process felt like we were cattle being herded.  I had to remind two different customer service representatives that we were still waiting to be seated and no one apologized or made any attempt to address our concerns.  I wanted to leave but did not want to disappoint my family.  When we were finally seated at our table-- we had to try to find a waiter that was willing to get drinks for us after waiting for 15 minutes.  When our waiter finally arrived-- he had sweat dripping off his face and explained to us that he was extremely busy and had too many tables to serve.  We saw chaos everywhere.  Again-- the entire experience was extremely embarrassing to me as I had hoped to treat my family to a nice Easter brunch that was filled with great food and relaxation.  We would have been more satisfied had we stayed home and ordered pizza.  When we finally were able to taste the food, it was another disappointment.  The potatoes were rubbery, the salad area had flies all over the place, and the desserts were still frozen.  The shrimp had a weird after taste.  We also didn't have enough plates and had to secure our deserts with coffee saucers.  The total bill for this disaster was over $280 for a family of 6.  My family members were also extremely displeased with the service and quality of food and were in shock of this sub par experience.  I felt like crying because of the extremely poor experience this was and feel like I ruined our family's Easter because I recommended going to the Wigwam for an upscale brunch experience.  When we finally left the Wigwam, no one even greeted us or thanked us for coming.  We continued to see stressed out staff and managers who were talking amongst themselves rather than addressing customer service and thanking us for spending this holiday with them.  The Wigwam has really missed the concept of appropriate hospitality.  I sincerely hope that you will take this feedback and improve your customer service and experience for future guests."}
{"text":"Was there for a wedding recently and later for a corporate function.  The faculty and staff provide great service.  You can tell that a bunch of money has been spent on this place recently.  Meeting/dining rooms very nice.  Everything on the interior and exterior is perfectly clean and immaculately manicured."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. Very spread out. Nice resort though and you can catch a golf cart to get around on hot days or if arthritis has you down. Would've given 5 stars but given a cold 'unwelcome' by a young desk girl who did not want to be bothered answering any of my questions. Consequently I had no idea where to go or what to do and spent entire first day in my room."}
{"text":"I stayed at the resort recently and was impressed, my room was better than I expected and the service was great. After check in the bell staff will lead you to your room, just follow the golf cart to a parking spot and they will help with bags, ice, anything you need. The bath products were very nice and the bathroom was big enough to play shuffleboard in. Starbucks coffee for your in room coffee maker and a nice patio to enjoy the morning on.    I called about golf and got a tee time and pick up by the bell staff, dropped off right at the pro shop. The staff at the course put my bag on the golf cart, I hardly had to lift a finger. I felt spoiled. The patriot course was very nice and I really enjoyed playing.    Reds bar was a lot of fun and had great food, nice place to stop for a round of drinks after a round of golf. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family for Easter and we had brunch at the Wigwam.  The place was busy, but we were able to get seated quickly.  The food was great and I enjoyed the wide variety they offered.  Our waitress made time to answer our questions and made sure we had a great meal.  I would definitely come back again if given the chance and try to enjoy all that the Wigwam has to offer."}
{"text":"The Wigwam gave me and my husband exactly what we were looking for in a stay-cation.  We arrived and were greeted by the bellmen; guided to where to check in.  The front office was pleasant.    Off to our room - a bit dated, but there are plans to update within the next year.  The property was breath taking.  Even though we are in a desert, you would never know with all the green everywhere.  We woke and ran around the property...stopping at the Farmer's Market...had no idea that there were so many local farmers :)  After breakfast, off to the spa to relax by the pool and for treatment...just awesome.  We came back relaxed and ready to start our week."}
{"text":"I recently stayed a night at Wigwam during a conference for my husband's job. We didn't order any food, but all of the events were catered through the hotel so I'll review that too.  Grounds: The first thing you notice are all of the beautifully manicured green spaces. Each path is lined with flowers and palm trees. The smell of fresh-cut grass and roses filled the air. There was a downed palm tree in the middle of a lawn, but they cut it up and hauled it away before lunch. The pool areas are also very nice and adults are allowed on the water slides!   Food: At each event there was a buffet of fresh fruit, canapes, and assorted beverages. These were always delicious. I especially enjoyed the beef kebabs. The conference also included a three course dinner which was great. The dessert was just okay but I'm not much of a dessert person.   Accommodations: The rooms were nice and comfortable. They stayed cool during the day and offered lots of privacy. I do have to knock them down a star because our bathroom was dirty. Really the only thing to complain about."}
{"text":"There's certain hotels and properties that give off a relaxing feeling without even trying. Or maybe it's that they try so hard that they make it seem easy. This is one of those places. It's just so incredibly comfortable to stay there in every way. Great location. Historic. Beautiful. This is our second time and and it was even better than the first."}
{"text":"I loved it!! Was a huge property, very well kept and the staff was awesome ! Brought my dog and she loved it too. Our room was huge, very quiet and great place to relax. It was 117 degrees and the air conditioner was amazing in the room. Super fun place. Traveling though for the military and can't say enough about this place."}
{"text":"The Wigwam is amazing! The customer service is top notch Lisa the Front Desk Manager went far out of her way to fix a booking we made through a online room search engine. She was amazing, we stay here every summer and never are disappointed! Thank you Lisa!"}
{"text":"Stayed here about 5 nights on a convention.  Beautiful grounds, but that's about it.  Sub-par restaurants across the board, although we did have a fine meal and excellent service at their one nice restaurant. Room service breakfast order was wrong every single day. Room was dirty.  I could actually see the dust bunnies piled up on top of window frames, and door frames."}
{"text":"***The Wigwam is a huge and historical golf, tennis, spa, and hotel resort just outside of Phoenix; it is not an incredibly luxurious destination, but room rates here seem to be reasonable during non-peak times***  Phoenix is a true value option for leisure travel.  It is not as expensive to live in Phoenix as other major U.S. cities and the good thing is that Phoenix's hotels and dining for business and leisure travelers are not too expensive either.  I stayed at the Hotel Palomar in Downtown Phoenix and it was a very nice hotel with a room rate that was 2 times to even 3 times less than what the same quality hotel in San Francisco or Chicago would go for.  The Wigwam, which is a hotel, spa and recreation resort just outside of Phoenix, also offers reasonable room rates if you are visiting Phoenix during non-peak times.  The quality of the Wigwam is definitely not at the same level as Downtown Phoenix's Hotel Palomar.  The Wigwam lacks that hotel's mixture of luxury with contemporary design and amenities.  Still, The Wigwam is a comfortable space with a few nice touches to elevate it above many hotels.  The grounds are where The Wigwam shines the most.  Lots of greens and desert appropriate plants and such.  Lots of palm trees too.  Decoration is very well done with well placed lights to make the bocce court, trees and outdoor lounge areas pop more.  The golf course also looks impressive and the attached Red's Bar & Grill serves satisfying gastropub food.  Other activities available at this resort include tennis courts, spa and a fitness center.  I did not try any of the recreational options at The Wigwam, but just walking around the resort was nice and relaxing (if you find the resort too spread out, free golf cart shuttle service is available upon request).  The lobby area is also upscale with lots of stylish and classic furniture and decoration.  It has a great historical vibe and Southwest feel that makes The Wigwam seem like an ideal place to stay in this part of the country.  The rooms are where The Wigwam fell short.  There were definitely highlights.  My room and closet were very big.  The bed was comfortable and it was outfitted with upscale bedding and pillows.  The room temperature was good too though the thermostat seemed a little old.  The room was definitely clean; however, some of the room decor felt dated.  The bathroom was nice (as were all the soaps and such).  My bathroom was equipped with a nice glass shower though I think shower/bath options vary by room.  The spacious living area had a nice table for dining as well as a big desk for working.  Unfortunately, there were no power outlets close to the desk, which felt a little odd and inconvenient.  During my stay, I also tried the hotel's catering and found it to be underwhelming.  Breakfast featured good pancakes, but the scrambled eggs were a big baked quiche-like concoction in a buffet serving dish while the bacon's fattiness resulted in an unappetizing burnt fat flavor as opposed to excellent bacon that was both crispy and chewy as well as meaty and fatty.  Dinner was a mixed bag.  Dinner featured high-end ingredients, but I felt the ingredients were not really cooked to the right temperature and texture one night while they were under-seasoned the other night.  Service throughout the resort was pleasant.  As mentioned, room rates can be reasonable if you plan ahead and stay at The Wigwam during non-peak times.  The Wigwam is a satisfying and not-too-expensive option for a hotel or golf stay in the Phoenix area.  There are definitely times of year when it is pricey.  We were there around Pro Bowl and Super Bowl timing and rates can get high when Phoenix is holding these major events (The Wigwam drew all kinds of sports personalities during this time including Dan Marino and Rich Eisen).  However, if you are staying in Phoenix during a non-busy time and want a more resort-like experience, I think The Wigwam would please many.  I am not sure what the parking situation is.  It might be free.  Valet and self parking are both offered."}
{"text":"Really really good hotel here are some things that would make it really really great:  -fitness center locker rooms should have sauna, steam and whirlpool exactly like Biltmore - would encourage more community memberships and resort guests would value it -litchfields should have a higher-end Sunday brunch thank reds (just how wrights has vs frank/Alberts) at Biltmore.  People with money in west valley have no where to go in west valley for nice Sunday brunch (guests would value same) -reds wait/bar staff need to be much better at customer friendliness.  Better service at local Applebee's.  But food is really good. -manager of litchfields very awkward and some management issues I've been surprised about.  Would value someone that can work the room and get to know (and take care of) regulars/locals.  Chef is amazing tho.  Food great and groupon deals really building buzz.   -pool cabanas subpar for price.  Put TVs/misters in them and I'll get on and sip drinks all day long -improve CRM system for locals.  Know who they are and take care of them.  Marketing to them should be different than to hotel guests.  Perhaps discounts if 85340 resident  -pool movie nights w screen would be neat.  Charge small fee for locals"}
{"text":"Beautiful resort. Stayed here for a few days during Spring Training and it was very close to Camelback. Rooms were big and comfortable. Nice big flat screen TV. Comfortable beds. Rooms look like lil bungalows from the outside. Great bar in the resort with great prices. Very clean resort. Great service. Valet is complimentary and very fast and efficient. I took one star off because of housekeeping. They don't replace the toiletries in the bathroom such as qtips or body lotion. Housekeeping took the trash (small bag) out and left it by my front door all day and today Monday at 8am the Gardner with the leaf blower"}
{"text":"Love the \"Wam!\" This is our second stay, again from last year (2012) & this time we requested a suite by the poolside, so we had a great patio area overlooking the main pool space! Wonderful and courteous staff... & there are always kid-friendly activities for the little ones. The fancier on-site Lichtfield Restaurant has an amazing menu featuring local produce and farmers market-type items, while the executive & sous-chef cook up your meals in the open area kitchen in the middle of the dining space. Don't miss the chance to grab a spicy Bloody Mary from Jeffrey the bartender... Can't wait to head back next year with my family!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! So friendly and safe for the kids (7, 9, 11) to go to the play area without us for a few minutes! The staff is friendly, rooms are clean and the chorizo breakfast burrito is amazing!! Will stay here everytime I visit our family in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Stayed here last week with one of my teenage sons. Reserved a room for two nights overlooking the Oasis pool. Had a few bumps in the road yet everything was taken care of promptly by Stephanie. The bumps in the road were due to mother natures furry of a monsoon, so it was not an issue with the resort itself. It is an extremely pretty property. A lot of private areas to sit and be by yourself if you want.  Will be here again over Labor Day weekend with my hubby. Happy we only live approx 10 miles away, yet feels like much further.  Thank you to the front desk and housekeeping staff....love this resort."}
{"text":"The Wigwam Resort is Stellar. The staff is accommodating and gracious. We can see why our friend recommended staying here. We will be back! HDIGABTT"}
{"text":"4.5 stars rounded to 5 for service. Staff was awesome. They direct you to your door with a gold cart when you arrive. We booked a king and we were upgraded to the suite!  The grounds are beautiful. Well designed and well maintained.   The room we were in was massive. One weird thing is the room was completely upgraded and modern except for the door knobs. Don't know why they didn't spend the extra money to make the finishing touch. Maybe they aren't done yet.   The price for a king room is reasonable.  The pools were also well maintained and we had the 20+ person hot tub all to ourselves.  I would go back!"}
{"text":"Updated review:  Thank you Wigwam for the help in trying to resolve and make peace with us. We really truly appreciate your efforts in resolving the problems after they were voiced. We look forward to our upcoming stay again"}
{"text":"This was our first time staying here for a dance festival. It was an absolute pleasure! We will be back next year. The staff was friendly and professional from check in to check out. The pet policy is amazing!!! I brought my son Rocky with me and he enjoyed staying in the room (pic included). Thank you for everything Wigwmam!  P.S. Hannah at check out was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Thanks for your help Hannah!"}
{"text":"Slightly 1980's decor, but definitely very large rooms and great service.  The golf courses and resort are very well maintained.  There are two pools and a few restaurants in the area.  It is located pretty close to I-10 which made it very easy to get to other places.    My favorite course was the Blue- and they also have someone pick you up from your room and will drive you to the club house.  The pools are very clean and we saw a lot of families staying here.    I would say I wish they had nicer tv's but I did like the touch screen thing they had in the rooms where you can get information on the resort and local attractions."}
{"text":"Great summer deals made us be able to experience this incredible resort. Great for singles, families and everyone in between. Beautiful rooms, grounds are gorgeous, pools areas are paradise. Staff are friendly. Have quite a bit of \"rules\" but didn't seem to be strict on enforcing. Be prepared for resort fees. Red's on the golf course has a great happy hour and breakfast. Hope to make this be our summer kickoff family vacation for years to come."}
{"text":"We stayed for an anniversary weekend and were very impressed. We usually go to a resort in Vegas and this was on par to superior. Service was a highlight with absolutely no missteps. Very high beginning to end.   We recommend one og the original bungalows called \"traditional adobes\" here for a Ricky and Lucy vibe, you can easily imagine the atmosphere in the heyday 1950s.   The lodge pool was immaculate and poolside service was fantastic. Prices were reasonable for a resort, much less than you'd spend in Vegas. If you want a pleasant weekend in a well kept resort, look no further. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awesome. We have friends who live in Litchfield and decided to visit.   If you're familiar with the Parker Palm Springs, imagine that without snobs and you get the Wigwam. Great service everywhere and luxurious grounds.  First off, the beds are magical and I wish every hotel had such nice beds.  Secondly, their Wigwam bar staff (at night) were fantastic! They accidentally forgot to remove chicken in my quesadilla and brought another one out promptly.   Thirdly, only $15 pet fee! Our little dude loved the grounds and had a blast.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We stayed for a three day conference in July. The rooms, grounds and facilities were very nice. Everything was well organized.  Nice food and drink options available. We had a minor issue with a tab at the pool side bar.  We brought it to managements attention and they immediately took ownership. They listened to our concern, thoroughly researched the issue, maintained communication and corrected the error.  We were very impressed.  Active and involved leadership like this helps maintain their great reputation."}
{"text":"Just stayed here for 4 nights. Shortly after I made my initial reservation I went to add another night but was told they can only just make a new separate reservation for the added night. I did not realize that because of that we would have to go back over to the main desk to get access back to our room after being locked out since we were suppose to check back in. The grounds are kept nice especially since they are always working on it so it does not make for a quiet relaxing resort. The room we stayed in was very dirty with stains all over the floor and the beds were so old we both had back pain and could not wait to leave. There was also food on the floor that was not from us. For management purposes it was room 648. It needs help! Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I was a bit dubious because this is an older hotel but we had a lovely time.  We opted to bunk here for the weekend because we had back-to-back concerts in the west valley.    Our room was huge and poolside.  The fridge was empty - THANK YOU!  I so appreciate having room for food and drink.  Beds were comfy and the bathroom was nicely appointed.  There was even a nice little bar area where we could keep our drinks.    We only ate the Tower Bar and it was a light lunch but it was fabulous.  Daiquiris, greek salad and hummus.  Delish!    I didn't have much interaction with the staff but the folks I encountered were nice and very helpful.    Be forewarned that it is a large property and it's easy to get lost.  When you check-in, the bell staff will have you follow them in a golf cart to take you to your room.  They also seem to have random staff roaming the property probably for maintenance purposes but they'll also pick you up and take you to your room if you get lost.  :)    Summer rates are reasonable and it was a nice little getaway."}
{"text":"What a great place to enjoy a wonderful and relaxing vacation.  Great service, great people and a wonderful environment.   If you want to relax this is the place!"}
{"text":"This review is for their golf course, and let me preface this by saying, I am not a golfer. I don't play the game, I attempt to play it. And, when I attempt it, I do an awful job at it. Let me put it this way, I am a pro at NOT hitting the ball.  I could win championships with my skill for hitting air.   That being said, this was a great course. I haven't been to too many courses in the Valley, but of them, I'd say this is one of the best I've played. There was a nice layout, with some easy shots and some pretty difficult ones. Not that it mattered for me, but for the other people I was playing with it was a nice mix for them.    With a great course, great scenery and, on this occasion, great weather, I definitely had a great time. And, if the occasion arises again for me to show-off my awesome air-hitting skills, I'll definitely do so at the Wigwam!"}
{"text":"This has nothing to do with the Wigwam but a little situation that happened regarding one of your staff:  I have always LOVED the Wigwam.  such a historic resort.  My 1st time was about 40 yrs. ago.  I have always lived on the west side.  I have gone for drinks, ( great entertainment), a few dinners, farmers mkt's.... etc.. one of your staff leaves a lot to be desired.   My husband & I came a Long Distance to go to your farmers mkts which I love going to.  But we must've come right before they stopped for the summer.  It was in the paper that the farmers mkt was still going on....  well, we were quite Angry getting there.  Nothing was there!!    It was NOT taken out of the paper.  I understand it was the business that should've not entered it in the paper.  Your gal at the front desk never once apologized to me.  Usually the resort apologizes for the business, etc. If she has any class at all she would've apologized.  All she said was...'right\",   'right', \"right\"  -  she has no social graces!  She needs to be taught to sympathize with the customers.  Last year before the winter, the same thing happened but my 85 yr. old mother & I went to the farmers mkt. and nothing was set up for the farmers mkt...  my mother was also angry to be driving all that way!!!!! I suggested to the gal to perhaps talk to the business who sets up the markets.  She said nothing at all!   a friend of mine who also lives on the west side said she did the same thing - going to the market and nothing was there.  So Please, delete it from the paper!!"}
{"text":"Ok. This is review is long over due,  but necessary.  We live in Tucson, AZ, and decided there were plenty of great resorts in the Tucson, and Phoenix area where we could stay and play, relax, frolic in the great pools, catch some rays, a cocktail, and go to a baseball game. We have two boys, 13, and 10...so a great pool was important.  We decided to buy really great seats at a Diamondbacks game on July 4th . They have a great Fireworks Spectacular at the end of the game. It did not disappoint...sooooo fun...a great big slice of Americana indeed. Tip *buy a churro dog* mmm.  Anyway,we settled on The Wigwam because my husband is a law enforcement officer, and they offer 50% discount for LEOS and military.  Wow! We thought...super generous.   Upon calling to book, we were told that all military/LEO discounted rooms were all already reserved for the dates we wanted to stay, 7/2-7/5. We were told to book and keep checking back each week (we did)as people's plans change and reservations open up. We went ahead and booked because to be honest it was a nice idea to stay somewhere,  and spend our money at a place where police officers were honored and welcomed.  Upon check-in we were told that,  \"Oh! Sorry. You got wrong information.  We don't honor the military/LEO rate on 4th of July anyway. \" The website implies something different.   So my husband was checking back each week in vain, and each front desk person he spoke with never told him that the discounted rate was not offered the weekend we were trying to book. Horrible communication and ultimately customer service on that piece right there. In fairness,  I realize this is a very specific problem...specific to our family and not everyone will have this experience. ..but nevertheless annoying,  and worth mentioning.  Our room was near the Oasis pool. Large rooms,  clean.  Its a historic, resort...older style, not rustic, but not modern. Grounds were well cared for it seemed. Kids were digging the sand volleyball,  and the Bocce ball. Parking not convenient.   Resorts in hot temps during a holiday weekend, with sooo many other resorts in the area competing for your dollars need to be ON POINT. I'll say it again, it's the 4th of JULY...people are coming to use the pool. People in Phoenix are waking up at 7 am to 95 degree temps and are headed to the pool.  That being stated, The Wigwam could not have been more off point for such a busy, hot holiday weekend. It was almost unbelievable. We arrived on a Thursday.  Check in time was 4:00...slides closed at 5:00. Sun goes down at 9pm...okaaay. Kids majorly bummed.  So, the next morning, we hit the pool early to get a good spot, kids chomping at the bit for slide time.  Lines already forming for slides, but  slides don't open til 10am! Wait. What? On 4th of July...they don't have earlier hours for slides, (like retail places accommodate customers at Christmas time?) Kids really bummed this time. 10:00 rolls along and no life guards. Correction, there was one life guard, but they needed two to open slides.   To make matters more annoying, their \"snack shack\" doesn't open until 11:00 am! You've been up since 6am in sweltering temps, you can't even  get an ice water until the snack shack opens. This was a strange phenomenon for a holiday weekend. Kids are running around with low blood sugar, starving, and adults are waiting in line for a beer, just one lousy beer. Hey, we've got money to spend...but The Wigwam doesn't want your money out at the pool!  So, the one responsible life guard that clocked in when she was supposed to casually galavanted around the pool letting us know she was off duty due to the fact that she had an extra large coffee thermos in her hand, and due to the very casually nature of her stride.  By this time it's like 11:15. Slide still not open because the key that unlocks the gate to one of slides gets stuck. Is this for real? This is like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch that I am stuck in, but it's not funny because I'm spending all my hard earned money on a sub-par pool experience. Maintenance comes and figures out key debacle....but then makes us wait again as they have trouble putting in the buoys that separate swimming area from slide area. Heart palpitations? Oh yes.  Kids get on slides and I start noticing all kids running around pool with red welts on their backs from the slides uneven seams digging into all of their backs.  Cool. I will say that my kids still having fun despite the bruises forming in the middle of their backs.  Next morning on the 4th similar pool experience. ..sweet concierge gal heard the sadness of our experience and gave us a resort voucher.. $50. Gave 3 stars instead of 2,  because of concierge kindness.   This review is far too long, but intensely cathartic. Also, I realize these are 1st world problems. ;)  Hope it helps for whatever it's worth."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Started out in a room which was huge. Kitchen area, ton of space it was great, until we noticed the little ants or bugs crawling around the counters. We did complain and got moved to a smaller room which wasn't that bad either but at least no ants. Turned out to be a good stay. Very beautiful at night around the pool area. I would definitely stay again."}
{"text":"Took my 94 year old mother to the Wigwam for Easter Brunch today just like we've done the past several years.  Today a mistake was made causing a forty five minute wait to be seated.  The staff apologized profusely & comp'd the meal for all of us. I made no requests or demands, just waited patiently.  It's Easter, they're busy I thought. Totally & completely unexpected.  Brunch was spectacular as usual.  Their service recovery showed a lot of class, five star service.  That's what keeps people returning! Kudos to the management team.  See you for Mothers Day!"}
{"text":"First time staying, and it'll be the last. For the amount of money you spend you'd expect a little more....everything.  Room service goes to voicemail.....no breakfast available during the week. A/C units sound like semi trucks.....which actually wasn't so bad, since it drowned out the sound of non stop sex from the next room. You can hear everything through the paper thin walls. I'm all about having fun, but at 5:38am I'd like to still be sleeping. I'm sure the family upstairs has already had to have some awkward conversations with the kids about the group next door. So glad we didn't bring ours.  Room conditions were also pretty sad. My wife went to open a drawer and the handle came off. On our first morning housekeeping came in as we were leaving. When we came back, she hadn't taken the dirty towels and left a room service tray on our front patio. There were spider webs, complete with actual spiders, on the ceiling. We have seriously stayed in better room at better prices in a Holiday Inn, which is terrible. If you're coming for the golf, then you'll have fun. If you're coming for romance, or literally anything else pictured on the website, save your time and definitely save your money. We will definitely be staying somewhere else next time we are in AZ."}
{"text":"Did not stay here but attended an Art Auction hosted by Park West Galleries.  Although the facilities were very good, clean and well maintained, the highlight of this trip the opportunity to meet both Peter Max and Tim Yankee and enjoyed listening to them discuss their work and to participate in the auction."}
{"text":"Everything as far as appearance goes was very pretty and our rooms were clean, however for the price we paid the beds were very uncomfortable and we actually got air mattresses on our 2nd night that were more comfortable. The mini fridge kept everything room temperature at best. The HDMI ports on the TV are also completely inaccessible. The TV is also at a very awkward angle compared to where the bed is, and it's nailed to the wall so you can't adjust it at all."}
{"text":"Resort was beautiful staff was awesome from the valets to the check in. Now  to the meat and potatoes for this review, after checking in we decided to go and relax at the oasis pool when we arrived at the pool around 1200 there was your normal group of people having a good time then within 30 minutes four families with around 12 kids between them ascended on the pool to enjoy the area the only problem the parents sat up in the bar area enjoying adult time while the kids ( about 10  12 year old boys / 2 little girls ) played in the pool, now you would say what's wrong with this picture well I'll tell you they were rude loud and was throwing a football and ball in the pool. I may sound like a kid hater however that is not the case we have four kids of our own ( all grown ) and love to see families having fun unfortunately that is not the case here we even moved away from the kids only to have them migrate to the area we moved to. We weren't the only ones that felt this way people in and around the pool were also complaining about the kids some even left the pool area now this is the icing on the cake while all this was going there was a resort employee watching the whole thing happen and didn't say a word..... Last but not least I would say to anyone wanting to have a little get away at the wigwam stay away and save your money, I can say without a doubt I will never be back and I will tell everyone I know how our experience was !"}
{"text":"The facility is incredibly clean, the staff is friendly...and I am referring to everyone I came across. A quick hello and a smile is the norm at the Wigwam. The Room was large and comfortable. The bed is incredible....big and fluffy....I slept like a baby!  The only negative thing was that they charge for everything. Like WiFi access and the use of computers in the Business Center. That became annoying.   The food was impeccable and the wait staff was very attentive. Check out the pool and especially the Water Slide. Great location for a Business Meeting and very Family oriented."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this resort for the past 5-6 years during presidents weekend for a kids golf tournament. We absolutely love coming here. It's a great resort to meet up with friends and feel relaxed. Our boys play Bing ping, bochie ball, baseball or football on the large lawn and also enjoy themselves in the pool with slides. There are fire pits through out the resort that give you a warm and comfortable ambiance to sit around and enjoy your company. There are minimal things I noticed that needed attention but if there is a concern the staff is very quick to respond and correct the problem. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. It is great for a family and a relaxing get away."}
{"text":"The Wigwam is down the street from my house so I often frequent there and I have had family stay there. I love this place - especially after all the renovations. It is beautiful and the staff is so professional and courteous. The history of the property is very interesting and the pictures and picture albums throughout the buildings is a very nice touch. No one is perfect and stuff happens so when it does these guys go out of their way to make it right. You can tell they love their jobs and appreciate your business. The pool is awesome and the new outside bar area with the new bocci court is wayyy cool to hang out by the fire pit. You can even roast marshmallows and make s'mores. The farmers market on weekends is a fun place to find some local produce too. The Wigwam is a true gem on the west side; adjacent to Blu Sushi and Taps - two other highly recommended establishments. To all the locals: check it out- the bar is a cool place to meet friends for drinks and have fun in an upscale but non pretentious atmosphere- something missing in the west valley."}
{"text":"Attended a trade show at the Wigwam Resort for a three night stay.  Was forced to return home early (already stayed two nights) and the resort did not allow me to cancel my last night (keep in mind this was before check out time).  Considering the fact the resort was almost empty, and we spent a lot of money at their restaurants (each night) I find it surprising that they would not provide me with an early departure.  All other hotels/resorts that I have stayed at provide flexibility . . . I guess the Wigwam stands alone.  Also, keep in mind they will hit you up for a $20 resort fee on top of their inflated rates."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, I have never had more employees be so disrespectful and unaccommodating especially when they are in a field of hospitality. I am completely turned off which is disappointing, as the grounds are very nice. The best part were the bell hops who were more than gracious but the front staff and restaurant staff were completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful staycation here this weekend!  The rooms were amazing - very clean and spacious- we stayed in the Fairway suite with adjoining rooms and it was the perfect set up for our 3 families with 6 small kids to run back and forth between rooms and play. The pool was a blast- Christine took great care of us.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet at Red's Saturday morning- and such a special treat for the kids to meet Ariel and Cinderella.    We can't wait to enjoy another staycation here very soon!"}
{"text":"I stayed their for a stay-cation. It was pretty good for the most part, except a coupe of lame things. We went to the Oasis pool and their were no towels. We order from room service 2 drink and a app and it was way over priced. People were very nice and the tennis lesson was great. Overall good but their are a lot of stay-cation options I may consider otherwise."}
{"text":"Originally booked a room for 3 night in which I was given the \"special\" rate because I was there as part of a wedding. A week later added a 4th night and told them that according to the web site's standard rates the 4th night now offered a 35% discount which was cheaper than the \"special\" rate and was told it would be taken care of. Didn't think twice about it until I checked out and saw that I still had the higher, \"special\" rate. Contacted reservations, eventually speaking to a supervisor, Karen, who informed me that I had signed a paper when I arrived that had the \"special\" rate on it so I was obligated to pay that rate. When I arrived no one reviewed the rate with me, maybe because there was a line and they were in a rush, I don't know. I shouldn't have signed it without reading it more carefully, but I didn't think I was getting taken advantage of and I thought the rate adjustment was taken care of already.   To top it off I found someone else's tow nail clippings on the carpet in the middle of the room the second night there. Seems they didn't vacuum before I arrived, or even the day after.   Pool was nice, bed was comfortable, TV reception sucked, room and bathroom was big, towels felt like sand paper, parking was terrible, food was good but pricey even for that place. Wedding was done well and that experience was nice.   Room was pricey, then they added a $22/night resort fee, then they taxed both of them at over 12% adding another almost $14/night.   I wouldn't recommend to anyone just because of the way they handled my rate, both before and after the fact."}
{"text":"We arrived for a small wedding. The environment was very nice. Well kept grounds, nice outdoor patio for cocktails and appetizers. The staff was very helpful and unrushed. The highlight though was dinner. The food was simply excellent and far above par for banquet facilities. I'm a vegetarian and usually you get something barely edible for dinner when you're vegetarian. But here we had a lovely salad, rolls, and something I don't know what to call but was delicious. I would describe it as a ratatouille stuffed empanada with a spicy tomato sauce. On the side was a beautiful presentation of stacked scalloped potatoes. Overall the effect was one of care and concern for the enjoyment of all guests."}
{"text":"I went here last night with my boyfriend and his two adopted sisters (ages 2 and 3) to look at Christmas lights on their front lawn. I know, it sounds a little weird, but for kids that age, it was pretty fun. And the toddlers we brought loved every second of it.   The Wigwam had fake houses set up to look like the North Pole, Santa's workshop, and a giant tree out front. They had so much fun wandering from set up to set up looking at lights and seeing all the lit trees. There were a couple other families doing the same, but their kids were all about 6 and older. I'm not sure they enjoyed it as much, but our group enjoyed it as they're pretty much amazed with ALL the Christmas lights we saw on the way home as well.  We even went inside and wandered around the lobby area as my boyfriend and I have done many times before. We sat infront of the fireplace they had going (the girls had never seen that before) and warmed up. They had several trees set up all over the place and being that the older girl is only three and knows how to count (albeit only to 15 or so), we had fun counting all the trees we saw.   They liked it enough to ask if we could go through it again and almost refused to get into their car seats, but I don't think older kids would like this set up as much."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! This is our 2nd stay and the 2nd time staying in room 646. I was so happy with the location that I requested the same room a year later. It's right by the Oasis pool which is now an adult pool Friday thru Sunday which makes it really nice. Last year the room was a little dated but so large and comfortable. I was so surprised when we walked in this year and the whole room is updated and beautiful! The bathroom is HUGE as well as the room. I will defiantly book this hotel again!!"}
{"text":"Loved this resort!! The grounds and amenities were awesome! The staff were extremely customer focused and helpful. The food was great! There were a ton of fun options for all ages all located in the property. I was only about 45 min. away from my house. It felt like I was truly on vacation (minus the business meeting I was attending).   There is a water slide/park for the kids. Two pools. Cabanas and outdoor food and beverage options near the pools. A bocce ball and horseshoe court. Outdoor seating all over the property. A large fire pit to sit around at night. Little shops and restaurants throughout. The rooms were more like one bedroom apartments (minus a kitchen). It was also very quiet and peaceful.   This resort is definitely worth it! Bring the entire family or come alone and relax!"}
{"text":"The Wigwam use to be a five star resort (the only one in the West Valley), the rooms now are equivalent to a three star hotel. We stayed in two different rooms during our stay (started in a double queen room and moved to a king when it became available), both rooms had carpets covered in stains and both door frames looked as if they had been damaged. I will admit that the staff for the most part was superb. Easy and efficient checkin by front desk personnel and very helpful bellmen. A note for the lawn maintainers, it's November...you don't have to do everything by 9am, how about not using leaf blowers near rooms that still have the Do Not Disturb on the door. On a side note, the only noisy area in the whole complex is the southwest corner facing west...avoid this location."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for 3 years straight now!  I have nothing but good things to say about the property.   The staff has always been extremely accommodating, and friendly.   Having 3 golf courses keeps me busy everyday if I choose.   Definitely play the Gold and Blue (Patriot) before the Red.    They are much nicer courses.   The rooms are nice and ROOMY, we love the fairway casitas becasue they're right on the course across from the practice facilities.   If you're bored, just hit some balls (they're free), or practice some putts!"}
{"text":"staying here was a reminder of the adage: you get what you pay for.    ROOMS: i'm reading other reviews that rave about the modern, recently renovated rooms and wonder if we stayed at the wrong hotel.  our room was stuck in the 1980s and in terrible need of modernization.  i'm sharing photos of the horrible sink in the wet bar, the bird-turd covered patio chairs, the ugly furniture and waste-of-space wet bar.    their TVs are small and old.  oddly, they have a fancy touch screen monitor to replace the traditional room service guide and other hotel information.  seems silly to go all out on an unnecessary item, but be frugal when it comes to necessities like a TV.    PRICE: we called one day in advance and got a great rate of about $160 for a double-double room.  i agree with others, the resort fee is ridiculous, especially since they don't provide you with much.     POOL:  the kids loved the slide but they are heavy-handed on the chemicals, so if you have sensitive skin, don't stay in too long or you may get a rash, as a couple folks in our party did.    GROUNDS: the grounds are lovely and well-maintained, giving the illusion of a luxury resort.  i fell for the architecture and all of the individual bungalows.  unfortunately, the outdated room interiors undermine this effort.  ROOM SERVICE: we ordered it once and were told it would take 30 minutes and it took 1 hour and a half.  we were grateful we didn't have to catch a flight."}
{"text":"What a lovely resort for a staycation in the West Valley!  We took advantage of an $89/night summer rate and really enjoyed our stay.  They upgraded us to a lovely ground level room that was comfortable and spacious.  The staff was so welcoming and friendly.  I enjoyed taking fitness classes and we ate and drank at the bars and restaurants onsite to truly get the Wigwam experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I were married at The Wigwam in March and we couldn't have been happier with our venue choice. We cant say enough good things about the wedding coordinator Allison - she made everything easy! The Wigwam grounds are beautiful, the ceremony site is wonderful and the staff are very accommodating and friendly. My husband and I would recommend The Wigwam to anyone wanting to get married or get away. We cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you are ever in Goodyear or on the west side of Phoenix. Stay at the wigwam. It has great swimming pools and kids love it here. The rooms are ok, but they beat the rooms from any other hotel in the area. Overall would recommend staying here and having a mini-resort like experience."}
{"text":"We really loved our stay here. The staff was friendly. We thought the food at the restaurants was excellent. There is a starbucks in the lobby, which i loved. There are a couple reasons why I didn't give them five stars that were just minor details: 1. The layout of the resort is pretty confusing. I got lost a couple times, and saw many people who seemed lost. 2. The resort fee seems a little questionable to me if you want to be able to use the internet. 3. The resort fee includes a daily paper and the front desk staff was unaware of that and had us bring them proof, which was in the booklet in the room.  These were all very minor issues and probably wouldn't be make or break if we traveled back here."}
{"text":"This hotel was the perfect spot for our family Spring Break! The service was top notch and there was something for all ages. From the waterslides, basketball hoop, sand volleyball court and many dining options, there isn't a better spot. The location was perfect for Dodger Spring training. We loved the complimentary shuttle on the weekends!   Reds was great for kids and adults. The patio seating was perfect and filled with many activities while the kids waited for their food.   The circuit classes in the gym were top notch and the instructor was amazing!  We loved how spacious the rooms were and that they were single level.   We can't wait to visit the Wigwam again!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean. Beautiful part of town. Rooms were well equipped and large. Service was friendly and efficient. It was during the week when we stayed and it was super quiet and hardly anyone at the Oasis pool each day. I would stay again."}
{"text":"My husband and I are staying here for the weekend for a little getaway. So far we love it here. They upgraded our room for us and it's a great room with a balcony and view of the pool. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The staff are very nice and accommodating. We enjoyed lunch at Red's and can't wait for dinner tonight at Lichfields. I would recommend staying at the Wigwam to anyone. The resort has everything you could need. We would stay here again"}
{"text":"Been staying here for years!!  Coincidently ... Stayed in the same room this time .. Unfortunately time has shown its age in this iconic desert beauty.. Maintenance staff overwhelmed .. We had leak from ceiling and cockroaches ... They responded quickly .. However...  I have noticed over the years basic cleanliness and improvements have been lacking ... Hoping they can increase staffing and maintenance.."}
{"text":"Stayed here for 5 days in March, and the family had a wonderful time! The staff was pleasant, the grounds were well taken care of and there was plenty to do right at the resort itself. In the words of my 8 year old... \"this is the MOST BEAUTIFUL hotel I've ever seen!\"  The kids loved the pool and waterslides. The pool was great for all ages, especially love that a step goes around virtually the entire length so that little kids can hang out and sit on the step pretty much anywhere. Decent amount of umbrellas but those chairs tend to get claimed pretty early in the day. There were bocce courts, ping pong, tennis, corn hole, fire pits etc.   Most negative reviews talk about how the resort is old and run down. I'd somewhat agree and if you're the type of person that wants brand spanking new tile and is put off by older (but generally clean) carpet, this might not be the spot for you. Things were well kept but could probably use a once-over. But, that's not the kind of thing that would affect my impression of a hotel so still maintains the 5 star review.   Thanks Wigwam for a great trip!"}
{"text":"A Gem Right In Litchfield Park  A out of town friend stayed a few mights at the Wigwam Resort.  I have to admit I love the wigwam.  The Wigan is a  Historical hotel that has modernized but has been able to retain the historical past beautifully.  The Wigwam has magnificent restaurant, beautiful golf courses, day spa,  places to walk, pools, bocce courts, and volleyball.  When you stay at the Wigwam you never have to leave the resort because the Wigwam has it all."}
{"text":"My wife has serious disabilities so we asked for an ADA room.  The room we were assigned was in the middle of the building away from any handicap parking.  The tub was about 2 feet high with handles bolted on either side of the tub.  There was no rail mounted on the wall to facilitate standing up or sitting down.  This required me to stand in the tub while helping my wife in and out of the tub.  The bathroom was not cleaned and had a narrow walkway making steering a walker difficult for my wife.  Due to my wife's disabilities we decided that we would put up with the room since we were leaving the next day and moving my wife in the heat was something my wife did not want to go through.  The Wigwam seems to live on past glories.  The rooms are literally 89 years old with a strong 50's feel to the decor.  There is a small walk in closet, and a cabinet under the television with two shelves (approximately 2 feet wide) for clothes (pack accordingly). For a double occupancy room you get one padded chair with foot rest and a typical desk type chair.  You need to be careful with the television so you don't incur a $10 fee for listening to music.  When I was checking out, the desk clerk was is such a hurry to close my account, he never asked how I liked my stay (or I would have told him all this).  I have traveled the world on business and am sorely disappointed with the Wigwam."}
{"text":"I am staying at this resort right now. It is gross. When I got in my room the floor in the bathroom was not clean. The toilet was dirty, the fridge is not cold and the room smells like mold. For the price this is not worth it. DON'T STAY HERE IT IS VERY DIRTY AND UNKEMPT.  The management really needs to invest more into each unit. REMOVE THE OLD DIRTY CARPET AND STEAM CLEAN OR REPLACE THE FURNITURE. YOUR PLACE IS DISGUSTING! Take pride in what u have and manage  it better."}
{"text":"Absolutely First Class, But EVERYTHING is extra, wired Internet $10 for 24 hrs, no microwave or fridge.  The Wigwam is without doubt gorgeous. The word is it was recently purchased and many upgrades have apparently been made. The room could use a few more chairs there was a vanity with no seating aside from a luggage rack."}
{"text":"I loved my experience at the Wigwam! Stayed here with my family this weekend and we had a blast. The room was so nice, it was spacious with comfortable beds. There was a nice little balcony overlooking the pool. We loved laying out by the pool and enjoying our drinks. I loved all of the old photos in the lobby. Just walking around the lobby was fun! I loved all of the decor. Really awesome hotel, good staff. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Old style golf course that is in better than average shape for an affordable public place.  The hotel on the 18th hole is nicer than one might think and the people that work there are very nice as well.   You can't go wrong for the price and the course is perfect for beginners or those not quite on their game."}
{"text":"Except for the spa, avoid this place.  The grounds are pretty, but everything is dated and poorly maintained.  The staff is rude, the food is awful.  My room wasn't clean, my room service order (when i finally got through) took forty minutes are was the wrong item.  My husband paid $53 to surprise me with a treat when i arrived in my room...it wasnt there, and when i got it it was 2 pieces pieces of whole fruit and about two bucks worth of granola and some water.  Not only all this, but when i checker in, they precharged my credit card for $200 more than the room charges...they must be used to people skipping out on the bill.  Too bad, a beautiful historical setting, but you can hear traffic all the time too."}
{"text":"I will definitely stay at the Wigwam again. The room we had was spacious, up to date, and very clean.  The bar also makes a very good Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"We just went to a wedding at the Wigwam and had an amazing experience! I think what impressed me most was the staff. Every single person that we came in contact with that worked there was happy to go out of there way and do anything to make your stay more pleasurable. The food was also fabulous at all of the restaurants on site. The beds were comfy and the rooms were clean. There are also lots of activities on the premises...bocce, volleyball, ping pong, and of course golf and swimming. I would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"Had an amazing stay at the Wigwam.  The grounds are beautifully maintained.  The staff was very accommodating; thank you to Erica at reception who welcomed us so warmly.  Our room was clean and well maintained.  We will definitely be back for another staycation soon."}
{"text":"We stayed here our wedding weekend. I'm not going to go into the myriad of things that went wrong, but I wouldn't recommend this resort to anyone. And I used to work here. If you want a nice room, stay at the Hampton Inn down the road."}
{"text":"We had a little stay-cation here during the summer and it was great. I'm sure during the busy season the room rate would be out of our price range but during the summer we only paid $82 a night.   The room was large and clean.  It had a rear patio with chairs.  They even gave us and our relatives adjoining rooms.  I was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality if the room and bathroom.    We had to pay the $22 per night resort fee which was worth it as we enjoyed the pool and bocce courts.  I will say that with a $22 per room, per night charge they could keep the bocce courts and cornhole set ups in a little better condition.  Besides that, the grounds were clean and well manicured.  The pool area was a blast.  They had a water slide for kids and a bunch of lounge chairs setup all around the pool.  They didn't have enough umbrellas for all the stands they had which seemed rediculous especially in AZ in the summer heat.    They had servers in the pool area that would bring food and drinks upon request.  They were organized and attentive.    We had a blast and will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"We stayed two nights at the Wigwam in a king Adobe suite on the gold course! We did get one of the remodeled rooms. It had a wet bar, and patio on the front and back.  For the first time in forever, it was just my husband and I. So, we came with the mindset that we would just enjoy ourselves, no matter what. The room was cute. And, honestly, you get a little bit of CA bungalow feel when you walk it. I can't seem to wrap my head around a few things though. 1. Why is the room decorated like an empty apartment? There are two small photos on the wall, and a chair awkwardly in the corner. These little spaces have the potential to really wow guests.  2. Why in the world are there $5 bottles of water in the room? I understand the concept of making money, but, you charge a Resort Fee. Why are you charging you valued guests $5 and not offering any complimentary water in the room. You're in the desert.  I will say this, RED DOOR = AMAZING!! All in all, it was a nice stay. The guys who pick you us on the golf carts are by far some of the friendliest staff ever!!"}
{"text":"The Wigwam resort is an oasis located in a beautiful spot in Litchfield Park. The property is wonderful and the main building is full of great photo opportunities and places to relax.  I was just there this past weekend for a wonderful event in the main ballroom. We had such a great time we decided to stay the night.  We enjoyed everything, we stayed in a beautiful Casita just off of the mai pool. The Casita is more of an apartment than a hotel room. The only issue I had was the walls in the room were so thin we could our neighbors conversations as if they were in the room.  Other than its a great property with great service. The room itself was gorgeous. It was difficult to leave!"}
{"text":"I was invited to a wedding here at the resort.  I had such a good time, it was so beautiful.  The well manicured landscape added to the romantic setting.  I did not visit the pool but everyone in the pool area looked like they were having a good time.  I tried to make an appt for me an my sister at the spa but they were all booked.  So call ahead if you plan on having any spa treatments.    My room was very nice and clean. The beds were very comfy and I slept really comfortable.  There was no refrigerators in the rooms, but they have these monitors that tell all about the resort.  My opinion they should have spent the money on refrigerators.    On Sunday they had what they called a Farmers market in front of the resort but it was more like a craft fair.  Not like the certified farmers markets that I am used to in California.  Still it was fun to look around.      I received a government discount for my room, this made the trip even more fun.  They charge a resort fee of $18 and this includes wireless internet.  Overall I would stay here again."}
{"text":"I have always come here to visit Red Door never stopped in for their restaurants.  We ate at the bar area.  It was not bad, but the service was so SLOW!  The burger was good.  We went to check out the room my friends were stay, it was nice and big!"}
{"text":"My first time at The Wigwam was on Friday, June 9th and Saturday, June 10th for a board meeting with AzSCA (Arizona School Counselors Association). We had our meeting in one of their meeting rooms called the Palm Room. Outside of our meeting room there was a light breakfast of pastries, yogurt, granola, fresh fruit, muffins, Starbucks Coffee, and tea. Inside the meeting room there was ice cold water. Everything was fresh and delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the two days.  Our lunch on Friday was served in another room called the Arizona Kitchen. We started off with a colorful salad of greens with grape tomatoes and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. A freshly baked roll with two pads of sculpted butter sat near the salads. Ice cold water and tea were in front of each plate. After the staff cleared the salad plates, chicken fettuccine was brought out in bowls. Each serving had one boneless, skinless chicken breast sitting on top of the fettuccine with cheese. The staff was timely in removing everyone's lunch bowls to make room for a cheesecake dessert with a sculpted piece of chocolate on top and a large strawberry on the side.  Towards the end of our meeting, right outside our door, fresh chocolate coated thick cut brownies were brought out with pretzels for a snack. The staff was efficient with removing dishes in our meeting room and making sure everything was perfect.  On Saturday, June 10th, we had the same breakfast items as the day before, but it was fresh as the day before-- and just as delicious. The Wigwam is a five star resort with friendly staff, clean restrooms, clean meeting rooms, clean and neat property. I had a good experience while there. Their parking is free and they offer valet parking as well. They use golf carts to shuttle people to their rooms or restaurants on the property.  I would like to return in a different capacity next time with just myself and my husband for a stay cation in the future."}
{"text":"Loved our stay here. The staff was friendly and accommodating.  We will definitely be back!  Room was huge with an awesome bathtub. The Oasis pool was right outside our back patio. The restaurants were an easy walk away. But if you didn't want to walk, the front desk sent a golf cart to take you wherever you needed to go."}
{"text":"The resort is very beautiful. The pools were very nice and the restaurants in the resort were great. Unfortunately, there were a few turn offs about the room. There was a smell of \"mold\" throughout our room and dead bugs everywhere. I understand it's a resort & the type of climate attracts bugs, but you hate to have that in your room. Also, the water temperature was freezing this morning in the shower, not sure why. Other than that everything was great and customer service was superb. For the price & what you get for your money, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Considering some of the reviews, I was pleasantly surprised  Check in went smoothly Main lobby-subdued, with very nice art work. Conf rooms clean with excellent lighting and AV Pools kept clean and warm Food buffet style for our meeting.  surprisingly good for a buffet Bellmen very friendly and delivered you and luggage directly to the room Golf cart ride piloted by the bellmen.  No driving on the grass! Concierge friendly and accommodating Historic  Old pictures of what it looked like in the 1940's everywhere."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place.   We stay here when we come up to Phoenix for the Cardinals games.  It's a bit dated, but this is an excellent place to stay on the west side of town.  The restaurant and bar close too early when there's a Sunday or Monday nite game, which is something they should reconsider as people will return to the resort for something to eat or a nitecap as they are all wired from the game, especially if the Cards had won.    The food is good and be careful of which rooms you stay in.  Some need a major rehab in terms of windows opening or the locks working.   The room we have had for the past couple of stays was so good we could have moved in and never left.   The gym is good, but a bit snooty from some of the local residents who obviously have memberships in the facility."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed for one evening at the Wigwam in May 2018. We enjoyed our stay, our room was spacious and really lovely with beautiful furnishings. We didn't eat at Litchfield's restaurant, but we did have breakfast before check out at their casual bar dining area. The food was good, and we loved sitting outside among the beautiful trees and chirping birds. The lobby is absolutely gorgeous, so much history and they have done a great job preserving and sharing history with photos and albums, and old marketing literature framed on the wall. The grounds are lovely too.   I disagree with other reviews that the rooms are \"gross,\" I think people expect a posh modern hotel but this is a historic dude ranch basically. I personally think the room was a perfect blend of comfort and rustic. I'm not going to freak out over a bit of rust on my shower head, that's ridiculous.   We did not have a smooth check-in experience. We were told at the check-in desk that the Bellmen would help us with our luggage, but the valet / bellmen did not offer this when we went outside to talk to them. They just told us to drive to our room. The communication was not good, we drove around lost for about 20 minutes trying to find our room. The signage is not good. Also, the oasis pool that we swam in was filled with dead bugs and debris. We ordered a piña colada at the pool phone bar (no service there at the pool, just a phone), and it took 35 minutes to arrive. The history and preservation of the hotel made it a great experience, but the customer service needs improvement."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a week for a business conference and across the board I was very impressed with the extremely attentive service of the hotel staff.  I don't think that I opened a door myself, lifted a buffet warmer, wiped off my own exercise equipment or looked for a conference room without an escort.  One evening we were having a reception out on the golf course (not the best plan in AZ in the winter) and the sprinklers went on.  Hotel staff literally dove to position their bodies in front of the sprinklers so that we wouldn't get wet - now that's customer service.  Overall the rooms and grounds were well maintained, but starting to show their age, with dated colors and patterns.   With the growth of Phoenix as a city, the resort no longer has a secluded feel - as it's now surrounded by miles of strip malls and chain restaurants.   I'd definitely return to the Wigwam for a conference.  I wouldn't return for pleasure, as, unless one played golf every day, there wasn't much to do at the resort and exploring the surrounding area would mean a trip to Chili's."}
{"text":"The hotel is outstanding.  Great grounds, the rooms are very large and spacious, the staff is very friendly and the food in the restaurants is great.  I would recommend Litchfield's, as the farm to table is the best in the valley.  I always love coming back to this hotel."}
{"text":"This review is only for their banquet staff and meeting space.  I participated in a golf tournament recently and the pairings party and post-golf awards luncheon was held in the ballroom of this hotel.  Both events were executed well.  The food was very good and fresh.  For both events, it was served banquet style with carving stations for the meat and live cooking stations for the pasta....very cool.  The VIP media reception in the pre-function area was a little crowded.  There was around 100 to 150 people there for that and I think the space can only handle about 100 max...it was a little uncomfortable.  However, the wait staff serving passed hors d'oeuvres handled it well.  The hosted bars were serving high quality Wine, Beer, and Liquor and the bartenders were great.  Overall, I was impressed with their ability to put on a high quality event.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Really nice resort. Little individual condo type units. Beautiful golf course out the back door. A very nice place to say the least but a little expensive for all things considered.  The layout of the property is in it self the most interesting thing about this place. We were here for a conference in the waitstaff for the event was absolutely phenomenal. They took great care of our group."}
{"text":"We are currently staying here.  Grounds are fairly nice.  We've attended events here indoors before and really thought it was nice.  Thought we'd try it for a \"staycation.\"  Staying here as a guest in a room is a different story.  As others have said--rooms are worn out.  We actually have a bar area in the room with fridge and sink but no glasses or bottle opener?  Had to request that and what they sent were very unclean looking glasses with handprints all over.   Wifi is absolutely unusable anywhere we have been.  You can connect but no pages will load.   Not staying here again.  Wifi that works is a must in the modern hotel industry and I just can't believe how some places can't figure that out. This is definitely not a \"resort\" but more of a nice restaurant area with motel rooms attached."}
{"text":"The room was very nice. It was a good size and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in while traveling. The facility was clean and well kept up over all.   The only negative, and this is a big one for me, is the \"free WiFi\" was essentially non-functional. I could get on, but the speed and the signal strength were just not much more than old \"dial up\" connections. I did contact the front desk, and they forwarded me to the IT people, but they tried and tried, and never really got it working for me the whole time I was here. Normally, this would not be an issue, but I had a family emergency while I was here, and I just could not do anything via email about it. It cause a great deal of frustration and marred my overall stay in what could have been a fantastic experience.  My suggestion is that if you can't provide high speed WiFi, and only hard wired with a data cable, please provide a data cable in the room or one at the front desk that can be borrowed. When I called the front desk, they said they did not have these cables/cords. If you are not going to provide a satisfactory internet experience, make it known up front. I would have chosen another hotel.  It's too bad that I could not really get past this and enjoy the whole experience here at the Wigwam Hotel and Spa."}
{"text":"The resort has potential. Hospitality greeted us and checked us out with a very friendly and courteous manner. We had a special rate so we were satisfied overall with what we got but would have definitely asked for a credit had we paid the full rate. The grounds are beautiful and the rooms are nice but need upkeep. Housekeeping also needs a refresher on cleaning.  Regarding the upkeep: One of the shades in our room was broken and kept opening up. Additionally, the AC wasn't very efficient.   Regarding the cleaning: Our bathroom was dirty on arrival. There were hairs on our towels and on the shower wall and the grout had mildew all throughout the shower. We called to ask that it be cleaned and the person that came, showed up with a set of fresh towels, which she just planned on handing to us. When we let her know that the bathroom needed cleaning, she came in, with no cleaning supplies, and just ran water to remove the hair from the wall and replaced the towels."}
{"text":"This review is actually for the Arizona Kitchen.  Went here for a Sunday breakfast. The place is very purty. When we arrived there was only one other table that was occupied, so we were seated right away. The menu is small and we knew what we wanted right away. I got the eggs benedict and the husband got a similar item , but it contained salmon and a different type of sauce.  The husband ordered some coffee and said it was some of the best coffee he has had in a long time. Our food arrived very quickly and was very pleased overall with the the eggs benedict. The only complaint that I had was that the sauce was cold..not even warm, cold. I had to take a bite with the egg and ham to make sure that i got a warm bite. My husband was pleased with his as well,but his sauce was also cold.  our server came to see how we were doing and I mentioned that the sauce was cold, instead of addressing the issue she just turned around and left and a few seconds later a lady came over to say that the hollandaise was supposed to be served cold. Hmmmm...I am no chef, but I have never had a cold sauce before. She never apologized, it seemed as though she was almost mocking me...like I obviously did not about food...whatever. She was not the perfect hostess, but I would not judge the place on her alone. The place is very quaint and I may go back to try some other items besides breakfast. I have heard that they serve a great dinner here, and I will definetly go back to check it out."}
{"text":"One of the most relaxing and enjoyable vacations, ever! This is thanks to top notch staff and a beautifully maintained resort. We felt comfortable (not pretentious or overly foo-foo) and well taken care of. Thank you Wigwam."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful 4 night stay at the Wigwam & loved it. Everybody was attentive and helpful, and the room we had was fantastic, and extremely clean (though a bit old, it didn't bother us and just seemed to add to the charm).   Food could be a bit better (to be honest, the pizza we ordered via room service was albeit flavorful), but what's to expect with any hotel cuisine.   Will definitely back, and I'm kind of wishing I was by the Oasis pool (which I wish they would regulate to be a bit less kid-friendly. Isn't is suppose to be the adult pool anyways? Why am I having to swat away 4 year olds doing handstands in the pool?)"}
{"text":"We decided to spend the weekend as my husband was playing in a golf tournament. We were also celebrating our fifth anniversary and my pending graduation from ASU. Let me start with the positives: 1. The Red Door Spa 2. A very good burger at Red's 3. Free dessert for our anniversary at Litchfield's. 4. Very nice staff at Litchfield's. 5. Plenty of pillows and towels in our room. 6. Delicious cinnamon almonds and large bottles of water were worth the $5 each charge.  7. We enjoyed the jacuzzi and Oasis pool. We found the pool area to be clean and well maintained. I agree with other reviewers that the towels need updating.  The things that make the Wig Wam just okay: 1. Your valet staff are your resort's first impression. They are very loud and mouthy among themselves.  2. We weren't interested in waiting an excessive amount of time to find our room while waiting for valet staff to escort us. Again, this is your resort's first impression.  3. The resort is adjacent to an elementary school. There is no illusion of escaping the real world when staying here.  4. The room itself is an odd clash of 1970s and updated. Grout kitchenette counters are really unsightly. I will stress though that the room was clean. The air was somewhat stale. The bathroom update is nice and the shower is okay: the rainwater shower head isn't particularly strong or adjustable. An old circular water stain is noted on the ceiling (this can evolve into mold if left unremediated). The carpet is ugly but appeared clean. The air conditioner unit is LOUD. The second night we opted to turn it off and crack the windows. The windows suffer from dirt on the sills and a very sloppy,bad grout job. The air conditioner caused my husband to have a bad night's sleep. It's room 385. Maybe you guys should get it serviced?  5. Five star resorts have real bathrobes. Your robes are thin, coarse and have short sleeves/ ill fitting. There were two of us and only one robe. Other resorts are on top of this.  6. Do you guys use manure to fertilize your gardens or is there farmland nearby? Friday night it was warm and on the humid side. The air smelled unpleasant. It may be out of your control but it also keeps your resort on the mediocre side.  7. Many issues with our dining experiences that contribute to your resort's mediocrity will be covered in my reviews of Red's and Litchfield's.  *Walking on your expansive property was akin to walking in a large apartment complex; not a resort."}
{"text":"How fantastic to have such a great getaway this close to home! I was frustrated that when booked in a group block, the reservations department can't view or alter reservations. Changes could only be made with group reservations during banker's hours. We ended up just keeping our reservation the same, for an extra night above the event...and we were glad we did. The king room was clean and spacious. The mattress was super-comfy. I need this mattress! Locally made snacks for purchase were a nice bonus. The staff was wonderful...except for the banquet employee at the open bar of the event we were attending. She embarrassed a friend by blatantly asking him and his wife if they belonged at the event. They went and retrieved their place card and ID to be served. This was asked of no one else. The room service and Red's menus were lacking on variety, but the fare we did have was great. The pecan-crusted tilapia at Red's was amazing. The steak was flavorful and seared to perfection. The service at the Wigwam Bar was also wonderful. Drinks were strong and abundant. The pool was a bit too MTv Beach House for us, but the kids would love the tunes and the waterslide. We will be back for a staycation soon!"}
{"text":"Traveled here for business. The wigwam is a VERY pretty resort and I stayed for 5 days. Some rooms seem not as worn/new than others (600 section seems to be a more recent addition?) I stayed in 241 which was nice but felt a little dated. I did like the size of the room and the patio area is a nice touch. I could hear the other people in the room adjacent (entire convo) to mine and the air felt stale in my room. The safe batteries went dead but I didn't inform the staff as I was leaving that day. I forgot a toothbrush and when I called, someone rushed over and gave me one and toothpaste to get by. I enjoyed the toiletries offered and they seemed to be of good quality but my room had no tub whereas some others did. My room was always picked up daily.  Late room service is non existent and there isn't much near by. The breakfast offered at the bar was surprisingly good and not too pricey. We ordered the BF sandwich, burrito and pancakes.  All good eating.  Check in/out was easy with no long waits. They offer a tray of oranges each morning in the lobby which I thought was nice touch.   My only complaint was the staff at the bar (Melody).  One in particular was VERY rude and impolite to our group. She acted as if she did not want to be at work or serve us. Not sure if she was having a bad day but my team and many other patrons were not happy with her actions."}
{"text":"Beautiful grounds. Amazing time during the holidays. Santa. Hot chocolate. Ice skating. Train ride. So much fun for the kids."}
{"text":"I'm a Arizona native that recently moved to San Diego. My family and I recently returned to AZ to visit our family for Easter. I booked a four night stay at the Wigwam to be close to our family that lived in the area.  The resort is beautiful but I was quickly disappointed once I got to my room. The faucet was broken and the tub had black stains. The beds were extremely uncomfortable with no support. On the second night all of our backs hurt and upon inspection of the mattress I could understand why. The sides of the mattress were bowing outwards leaving that sinking feeling in the middle of the mattress.   The high nightly rate that I was charged is not worth staying at this resort. I'm very disappointed and will stay at another resort in Scottsdale for the amount I paid."}
{"text":"Currently here for a conference. Attaching the word \"resort\" to this facility is nothing short of a criminal act. I will spare you the litany of incredibly poor service. Wrong room. Wrong keys. Wrong relocated room. Wrong keys. The facility is incredibly dated but unlike some older Phoenix facilities (the Clarendon comes to mind) this joint fails to overcome with good service. To the contrary. If you are planning a conference here, STOP!!!!!  Don't do this to your attendees. I am happy to detail this in excruciating detail but spare yourself. Plan your conference elsewhere."}
{"text":"Since I've spend most of my life in the Valley, I can tell you most things about most resorts and here in Arizona we have plenty.   The Wigwam has a long history and it shows if you're a guest in the casitas! Ugh, never again.  The porch light stays on all night and the blinds don't do a great job at keeping the light out so we had to hang our Terry cloth robe over the door to block the light! Seriously? The rooms were spacious but the age is noticeable.  The breakfast in the morning was super pricey and just okay, its a very limited menu.  The pool was fun for our family and the bar and snack service was super friendly.  The dinner restaurant wasn't open when we were there so we had to scramble to find a place to eat.    Gorgeous grounds and lobby, friendly staff (except the ones serving breakfast-they were a little too zombie-esh for me), but I don't see me running back. (For a business event they're a five star)."}
{"text":"Just retired from the military and stayed here several times.  Nice staff who are very helpful, nice rooms, great amenities, and great location.  4 stars.  The only negative that I can think of was slow WIFI."}
{"text":"Worst experience for any \"resort\" I have ever stayed.  Took advantage of the AZ resident rate - what a mistake.  Room 289 was only fit for shade from the elements.  Tub did not drain, carpet worn out and frayed, live bugs, etc.  Drove back to Tucson to take my shower - it was that bad!  Water slide locked and unusable, hot tub broken, bar and grill not open; the list goes on.  Wrote General Manager about condition of room and offered photos - NO RESPONSE!  Highly recommend you stay anyplace else!"}
{"text":"Such history and charm in this place! It's a HUGE campus with multiple pools, golf courses, restaurants, and sitting areas. If you're looking for a golf getaway, or a relaxing vacation, this place looks like it'll fit the bill.   Kid friendly, live music, and good food await you. Litchfield's, their fine dining restaurant, was fantastic.  I haven't stayed in the rooms yet, but I've been in one of them and it looked great."}
{"text":"I love the charm of this place, yet the Wi-fi needs a little boost! I had to balance fun with work on a recent trip, and there was no work to be had, or maybe that is part of their plan?"}
{"text":"Back again for our annual staycation 2 miles from home , This time the wife had 4 friends from Chicago here to visit for 4 days , stayed in 318, 319, 320 ,by the Oasis pool,  everyone really enjoyed themselves , staff very friendly , rooms clean , and cool , just a couple of concern s they had , apperantly people can't pick up after themselves , the Oasis pool had cups and other things around the pools edge a couple of times we went there some of which I kicked in the pool not seeing it, also if you order room service watch for the service fees off the menu especially by the pool if it's dark , You won't see it , again otherwise very nice stay again and by the way I like the white color scheme your going with on the building s  Thanks again"}
{"text":"Great resort. The rooms are very nice with a little extra room, which is nice when you are staying with kids.  The main pool is great for kids and is generally very crowded, but kids like it.  The backup pool is relaxing, but kids prefer the main pool.   The staff is very helpful.  They have a great happy hour."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the Wigwam and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a low-key vacation spot. The grounds are beautiful and the service is exceptional, including the knowledgeable concierge who went out of her way by calling her personal contacts for advice on a hiking recommendation and then call me back with a wealth of information. I went in mid December and we practically had the whole place to ourselves, which gave us ample opportunity to explore the amenities and beautiful rose gardens, fountains, and the interesting layout of the resort. The pool areas are just beautiful! I came for a getaway from Chicago and it really felt like I could relax here and just get away from humanity for a few days.   The only thing that could make the resort better is if the rooms were a wee bit more polished and updated. However, for the price I paid, I got a great value and a large, clean room, so I really can't complain.   I will most definitely be back to the Wigwam : )"}
{"text":"Played the Patriot.  Stupid name, being AZ it's obvious why they changed it.  You need a road map to navigate this very poorly laid out course. No map on scorecard.  Decent greens.  Thin fairway with lots of bare spots.  Yardage markers almost non-existent.  Very friendly staff.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"My husband and I have loved coming to the Wigwam for the last 5 years. It's our favorite staycation resort in the West valley but after our stay last night that is no longer the case. We decided to book a room this time around for my husband's birthday and brought our 4 year old son with us. We were doomed from the get go. We arrived around 1:30 p.m. and I was told that our room was ready even though they have a 4 p.m. check-in. We got there early to enjoy the pool.   We were given the keys for room 245 and were horrified by the condition of the room. It was really, really bad. There were dead bees all over the window sills and floor in addition to live bees flying around the room. The room was also not cleaned as there were dirty towels lying on the floor, a bed that looked slept in and a dirty cupcake wrapper on the dresser. To us, it looked plainly obvious that house keeping had not been there in some time and based on the number of dead bees there were I can't imagine anybody had recently slept in the room either. My husband called the front desk and we were told the Bellman would arrive shortly to put us in a different room. We decided to wait outside due to the live bees still flying around and the overall disgusting condition of the room.   As we were waiting we noticed on the exterior wall of our room there were two areas where honey was seeping out from the wall. One area of honey had 4 baby birds stuck in it, 3 were still alive and one was dead from being cooked in the sun (mind you it was 114 degrees outside that day). Not only were my husband and I really disturbed but our 4 year old started to get upset.   The Bellman arrived fairly quickly and escorted us to room 260 after we showed him the condition of room 245. When we first walked in there was a weird smell in addition to a dead roach on the bathroom floor and a bug in the tub. My husband and I are very laid back individuals and usually have no problem letting most things go however; given the state of both rooms and the fact that we now have a horrified 4 year old, we deemed it necessary to notify management.  So, we walked to the front desk and asked to speak with the Manager on duty. The woman we talked to was very pleasant and informed us that the Manager (Bitsy, I believe was her name) was on the phone. We waited for about 15 minutes and the Manager finally came out to talk to us. We explained our situation and asked to be moved to another room. She appeared to be very understanding and told us to go enjoy the pool while she got it all worked out.   So that's what we did. At this point it was 2:30 p.m. The service at the pool was less than adequate from what I remember during previous stays. The attendant took forever to get us water and would disappear for long periods of time in between drink orders, but our son did enjoy his time swimming. Around 5 p.m., we went back to our room, changed clothes and went to eat dinner at Red's. As we were halfway through our meal, the Manager called us to inform us she had another room available and to come to the front desk when we were ready. I first agreed but after hanging up and discussing it with my husband we decided to stay put because it was already almost 7 p.m. at that point and our son wanted to go swimming again.   The level of quality was definitely not up to the standards we've been used to during prior stays and it definitely appears something has changed. It's with a heavy heart that we'll be going elsewhere for our next staycation and will no longer recommend the Wigwam to others like we used to in the past."}
{"text":"The resort is beautiful, however, I wasn't very pleased with the service we received.  Our room had two doors to the outside.  One of the doors had a 2 inch gap that didn't seal.  The service was extremely slow in both restaurants that we dined in and the food wasn't that good.  I was disappointed because the service didn't live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"I went to this property with my BF for a wedding. Not the greatest experience. Which I was very disappointed.    From the beginning - I made the reservation (over the phone) - the first two people I talked to wanted to down grade me without even asking me what I really wanted. I wanted the nicest room close to a pool.  Once we checked in - we got there early maybe 10am - they said 4pm was check in. We were absolutely fine with that. We decided to go the pool and get a cabana, which we ended up spending over $350. (Which was more than the room rate).   We went back to the front desk around 2:30 simply to follow up on the room. The girl, completely robotic, kept saying \"check in isn't until 4pm!\" Over and over.  She didn't understand we were just checking to see if our room was ready since the rest of our group easily checked in already.   Our room was ready around 3:30 - thankfully for the concierge being so great and simply following up with the housekeeping. The front desk didn't want to tell us anything. She was on her a-game. Her name was Eddily! Big thanks to you!   Finally getting into our room. It had an issue with the air conditioner which we mentioned to the bellman, who called it in to stop by our room to get it fixed. Remind you!!!!! This weekend was 119 degrees outside! Painful I know! So they never showed up. The whole time we were there they NEVER showed up.   When we checked out - the girl was super sweet offered us a discount for the inconvenience but we declined. We didn't want a discount we SIMPLY wanted good experience overall... we are reasonable people. We understand how businesses work. But we'd appreciate an honest response from a person and getting a job done. Especially when an AC goes out in a room. That's the worst!  We even did the interval survey - gave a direct contact. NO RESPONSE back.   We know people in the Travel industry and we have advised them to avoid this place. Too bad because we could have brought them some good business."}
{"text":"The Wigwam is the classic Southwestern resort hotel. My wife , daughter & I went today for the Easter Brunch. We could not believe how incredibly busy the place was for this event. We stood in a line to check in for 15 minutes or so, which wasn't too bad as they had a Mimosa & Bloody Mary cash bar ($7 ea.) strategically placed near the line.  They even had two hostesses checking folks on. I can't imagine how it could have gone any faster. The ballroom in which everyone was seated was packed.  The food was ample in diversity and serving stations. A couple of surprises though. The beef carving station was of a thick top sirloin, not the typical prime rib. One type of fish, pan seared salmon on an Israeli Cous Cous bed, was available. There were several pasta dishes, an omelet station and various salads, breads & cheeses as well. There was a nice dessert bar as well. All for around $45 per person.  I was somewhat surprise when the bill came & a 20% gratuity had been included. Not that the service was bad, because the young lady taking care of our table did a fine job picking up the 3 or 4 used plates and brought us water quite nicely. But 20%? We had to fetch our own food.  Anyway, it was nice, just not that nice."}
{"text":"The grounds are beautiful and the patio areas are just beautiful!  My complaint is with the Wigwam Bar.  The food was probably one of the worst meals we've ever had.  We dined there on Easter and perhaps it wasn't the regular or most talented staff due to the holiday, but service was not good and the food was barely acceptable.  We all enjoyed a finely made cocktail and I believe each drink was $9 which is acceptable and comparable to other places.  Our youngest daughter had a virgin strawberry daiquiri which was $6.75 and seemed a bit over-priced, but still acceptable.  We all enjoyed the chips with salsa and quacamole which was good.  I had the quesadilla which was okay.  Somehow not as flavorful as I had imagined from the description, but decent.  Another person had a shrimp and chorizo plate that they felt was okay.  The problem was with my husband and daughter's burgers.  They ordered them well-done, but they were quite pink throughout.  My husband managed to eat approximately 75% of his although he reported that it really was not enjoyable.  Our daughter took one bite and stated, \"It tastes like a dirty diaper.\"  Yes, we're all wondering HOW she knows what a dirty diaper tastes like.  She didn't eat any more of the burger but did eat her fries.  My water glass remained empty throughout the meal.  When the waitress inquired as to how we enjoyed our meals, I did inform her that our daughter's hamburger was quite uncooked in the middle.  She did offer to have it remade, but at this point we all were finished with our meals.  I asked if she could remove it from the check and she did, including the fries that our daughter DID eat.  I was grateful for that.    I think we would go back for the happy hour which I believe was 5-7 daily and had certain drinks and food items for $5.  I don't think I would pay full-price again for the food.  Honestly, we've had better fast-food or quick-service meals, but, certainly the atmosphere at the beautiful Wigwam Resort can't be beat."}
{"text":"pros  1.  the people here really put an effort to make their guests feel welcome. 2.  the pool was nice.  they even have a slide for big n small kids 3.  rooms are spacious 4.  starbucks coffee u can brew in the room  (i believe it\"s free) 5.  tv selections were great.  don't think u have to pay. 6.  u can get starbucks coffee at the lobby (not for free) 7. u could actaually drink from the pool 8.  pool closes at midnight  cons  1.  they mow the lawn n cut the bushes as early as 8am in a friday.  hard for guests to stay asleep. 2. the front door of our room seemed like someone had kicked the door.  the condition was not too bad, but not good 3.toilet room needs to be completely separate from the changing or make-up room for guys who need to go stright to the toilet 4.  gift shop sucks..small..don't bother     my rating = 3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Every time I stay at the WIgwam, I never want to leave.  It is such a beautiful hotel with amazing gardens and grounds.  The staff are friendly, the service is great and the brunch is fantastic! A little retreat in the desert, I always leave super relaxed! A great place to get away on a staycation in the valley!"}
{"text":"The Wig Wam Resort is a sprawling complex west of Phoenix in Litchfield Park. It has old school charm, with adobe inspired architecture. There are 3 golf courses with 18 holes; there are 3 pools, tennis, a conference center, and 3 restaurants. It also has a full Elizabeth Arden Red Door spa,  The rooms are large, probably big enough to fit 8 King size beds side by side in a 2 x 4 format. The bathrooms are also large, with his and her sinks, separate shower cave fully tiled with a seat, large tub (but no jacuzzi spouts), and a walk-in closet. The furniture is large pieces of oak with a darker stain, and the colors are neutral sand and light cactus colors.   Most rooms have balconies or patios that usually face into the pool areas. The property is well manicured and maintained.   Wig Wam is a Starwood property (Sheraton, Westin, W Hotels, 4 Points) , and part of their higher end Luxury Collection brand. It is also an AAA 4 Diamond resort. However, this time of year (early June), it is very affordable. The conference rate I was attending was less than $100, but even the general best available rate was less than $150. I am sure that high season for snow birds the rates jump to over $300.  As a full service resort, service is very good and everyone is very helpful and friendly. Parking is a little problematic, as you have designated areas and then walking to your room maybe a little distance. Of course they have full valet service, but self-parking is free.   There are a lot of Spa and Resorts in the Valley of the Sun, literally hundreds of them, like golf courses, too. But if you like old world charm with a southwestern flavor, in a relaxed subdued atmosphere away from the show-off upwardly mobile wanabees of Scottsdale or Phoenix, this is a good choice, especially if you like golf."}
{"text":"Very classy, friendly, and helpful resort staff. Beautiful grounds, well kept. Two pools so that you don't have to be around noisy kids if you want a more serene setting. Delicious breakfast at Red's Bar & Grill. Overall, a great place to get away and enjoy the Arizona sun."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Wigwam during my firm's recent retreat.  The grounds were immaculate and it was so cool to see and hear so many types of birds on premises.  My room was huge and immaculate.  The service from the valets to front desk to maids were all incredible.  The food on site left a little to be desired, as most hotel food does.  Overall, definitely worth a stay!"}
{"text":"truly lovely resort.  i had the pleasure of being a guest here during the holidays (25th-27th). Super low season...we pretty much had the place to ourselves :D and though, as a so cal girl, ive sadly never had the privilege of a \"white christmas\" i was thrilled to bask in a 70s clear sky xmas, just like home, throughout this very novel holiday experience.  part of me regrets not getting more out of the resort since i slept in so late the 2 days i was there. i recall starting the first full day around....2 pm? ha. but minor fake regret is evaporated since it really meant i utilized our uber massively cloud-like bed with equally magical silky egyptian cotton sheets and melt into oblivion down pillows. in my opinion, the distinction of a classy place is largely defined by the bed, and this place passes that test 10-fold. ahhh bed. thank goodness i recently invested in a good bed of my own or i may have suffered some withdrawals leaving here.  we stayed in the adobe-style suites along the golf course. most of our party was in the interconnecting rooms, but due to wanting previously spoken of awesome king bed instead of a 2 queen room, we were located further down the row on our own (resort was very accommodating of that last min change, btw). huge comfortable space with kitchenette (no fridge though), and back patio overlooking the golf course.   highlights include:   - awesome bed (redundancy to drive my point home). i like to focus on details and i fell in love with the red-orange throws the provide on each bed. - wonderful showers with classy toiletry amenities - complimentary starbucks coffee to use in provided coffeemaker (even starbucks cups!) - well-maintained tennis courts. probably the most enjoyable aspect of the stay...though i LOVE tennis and it had been years since ive gotten to play. they provide coolers with water and cups, always stocked it appears - multiple pools and a hot tub. i luvs me some hot tub.  - outstanding service. i happened to endure a freak \"toe-stubbing accident\" playing tennis that split my big toe nail in half at the top, bleeding all over. they sent someone over to our room with first-aid asap and this minor injury was treated like i broke a bone or something. really impressed.  only gripe: not much is complimentary in addition to your room. There are lots of things available for use, like the resort gym and wifi...but at an added cost. I think the gym is $15/day. cant remember the internet cost but its def not free."}
{"text":"Nice, older, historic property.  It is old, but very well maintained, with modern amenities.  I like the original buildings and single pane windows, but they can be a bit loud if you are near the pool.. which is a nice pool.  Overall, this place is a neat place to stay. I recommend it."}
{"text":"An amazing resort, although we didn't play tennis or swim, and we just stayed for one night. The Wigwam is a beautiful place, on the Historic register. We had a delicious breakfast out on the patio. The central building is full of wonderful Indian and Southwestern art. Make sure to meet friendly Jim who will give you a tour and history of the interior, and Ray who will give you an encyclopedic tour of the grounds, buildings and history on his golf cart! Lovely, we will come again for a longer stay!"}
{"text":"We stayed here in June, 2011. We had a wonderful experience. The staff was friendly, worked with us to give us a good rate (comparable to nearby hotels) and the resort provided much needed space for the kids. The property has everything you need for your stay - swimming pools (waterslide to boot), restaurant, fire pit outside to roast marshmallows and relax by, and large rooms.   Tip: Walk across the property and out the gate to the Old Pueblo Cafe. They have good food at reasonable prices and live entertainment on the weekends!"}
{"text":"My review will be a two part process. I first went to the Wigwam resort over 18 years ago to run a conference and it was perfect, accommodation, staff, services and grounds. Coming from the UK I was not used to such surrounds, the mountains/dessert/cactus (bigger than me). Such was my experience that having moved to the US and lived here for 16 years on the East Coast I was delighted to see the Wigwam on Groupon at a great deal and purchased a stay which is coming up June 12th... I have been so looking forward to my walk down memory lane. I'm kind of wishing I hadn't read the reviews, but also glad I did...decisive eh...I wanted to bring my husband here as I told him so much about my event and activities I wanted to share those for his birthday... June 12...I have to say there seem to be less enthusiastic responses and much more disappointment with the resort than I had anticipated. I really hope I am pleasantly surprised, and will post on my return around June 20th my verdict. Victoria G"}
{"text":"First the hotel is nice. Two people of the entire place were helpful and I wish I could remember their names. I rented out a meeting room. I've used several places. Nobody greeted me and nobody checked on me all day. Hundreds of dollars to use their projector and extra fees to use their WiFi. Overall customer service was a 1 star. The room wasn't thoroughly cleaned. I was bitten by mosquitoes and killed a black spider. I usually reward staff with generous lunches or gifts but I didn't see anyone. I have great relationships with the hotel staff but my customers nor I were happy with this place."}
{"text":"Here's my comprehensive review after spending 8 nights here during spring training:   PROS: 1. My deep tissue massage care of Joy at the spa was by far the best I've ever had. We typically stay at 5 star resorts and spas (Ojai Valley Inn, Terrenea, Ritz, etc) and she could definitely hold her own. Great job. The spa itself leaves a lot to be desired (see CONS).   2.  Good wine list but overpriced.    3.  Only \"resort\" in the area so you take what you can get.   4. Friendly staff.   5. Free oranges in the lobby.   6. Pretty grounds that smell lovely and are well-kept.  Fairly quiet.   CONS:  1.  The rooms. I expect more given $$. Rooms don't have windows or sliding doors (those are \"special\"?). We both got sick from all the central air and fans since we couldn't have fresh air in the room. Our shower was clogged and there was typically 2 inches of standing water during / after each shower. Yuck. The light in our bathroom was broken and the toilet ran. The linens are not 4 star quality. Our first room (in the 300s) smelled awful. We moved to the ones near the golf course. A bit better. Try to get a room near the oasis pool (\"adult\" pool - more on that later).  Refrigerators are not cold enough. Eh for rooms.   2.  Food. Not good except maybe the daily happy hour. Eat offsite. We had the chicken chowder which was bland and full of fat. The drunken bread was greasy.  Both times we ate at the bar, we had to hunt down a server. What appeared to be the manager ultimately helped us.  Waitress admittedly had a cold... Maybe send sick staff home?   3.  Amenities.   The oasis or \"adult\" pool is not. No one watches so teenagers are everywhere. There was a 2 year old in the hot tub. I prefer \"adult\" pools as young folks are loud (beer) and kids are not always clean in water (if you know what I mean). If they advertise an adult area, they need to monitor it better. Plus no one is around for beverages or food.   The spa hot tub was dirty!! I've been to any many spas in my day. This one lacked cucumbers for your eyes, fruits, nuts and the little niceties that make luxury spas. Considering the $$ I would have thought this was luxury.  My experience suggests otherwise.   The staff do not seem to have a full grasp of what's going on at the resort. There are so many events no one seemed to know when Litchfields was open or closed. We were told 5:00, then walked into what appeared to be their staff meeting. A lot of general confusion just trying to have wine at the bar.   Gym was fine.      Overall since there are no other options it was an okay experience. I'm nit picking given the cost and expectations that are set based on what is presented on their website.  If it was less costly and advertising was a tad but more honest, I might have been happier."}
{"text":"My family and I stayed over night for the Wigwam Resort for their free 4th of July celebration. Amazing firework display over their golfcourse.   Pool area gets quite busy at this time. Lots of pool staff and they try to keep the area as clean as possible. They also have an adults only pool.  Summer rates as low as $89 but expect to pay more on Holidays.  Tons of activities for all age groups.   Rooms are a bit older but very clean and comfy."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to do a little staycation at the Wigwam - just 2 nights.  We had never stayed there before, but had attended a seminar and an office function in the past and we thought it was a pretty cool place.  Lots of history, which we really love!  When we arrived on Monday we asked for a room over by the adult pool, and the person checking us in said, \"Oh, the Oasis Pool?\" and we said yes.  I had read on their website that it was an adult pool and she confirmed that with her statement.  So we were off to our room and I had lovely visions of laying by the pool with nice music playing and a cabana bar nearby where waitpeople would come by and bring us fruity rum drinks.  So we got our suits on and ventured out to the pool.  There were only 3 other people there, and two of them were teenagers.  No big deal.  They were being quiet.  So we looked around for the cabana bar, and there was one, but it was closed (and there was no music).  I was disappointed, but thought maybe it would open a little later (it was 3:00pm).  Well it didn't open and it was pretty obvious that it would not open anytime in our lifetime.  So my husband found a phone over at the bar with a sign that said you could order over the phone and they would bring the drinks/food to us.  We ordered a Bud Light and a fruity rum drink.  It took about 20 minutes to arrive.  The bill was $24.00.  $24.00!!!!!!  The beer was $5, fruity rum drink was $8, a room service fee of $7 and a delivery fee of $4!  Was it our fault the Cabana bar wasn't open?!?  I asked the server (who could barely speak English) when the Cabana bar would be open.  She said in broken English, \"Only open on special occasions\".  What?!?  So off she went and then here come the little kiddos all excited and immediately doing cannonballs off the side of the pool!  Woo hoo!!!  OK, now I'm upset.  So I call the resort on my cell and ask if they have an adult pool.  I'm told the main pool is separated by a bridge and one side has the water slide, etc, blah, blah.  Then I say, I heard you have an Oasis Pool that is for adults.  And I'm told, well, most of the kids are at the other pool, so you would only occasionally see children at the Oasis Pool (as I'm being splashed by the latest cannonball).  He says, children are allowed at all the pools, however.  I thanked him.  Ok, so they don't have a specific \"adult\" pool.  Just another disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, I love kids.  I just don't want to put up with screaming and cannonballs while I'm attempting to enjoy my $12 Mai tai. Our room was nice, but it seemed a little odd that they would have this high tech touch screen computer on the desk touting their resort services along with an old fashioned TV in the old fashioned entertainment center.  And by the way, the picture links on the touch screen didn't work.  Our bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very large with lots of towels and toiletries.  Very nice Mexican style glassware and the usual coffee maker. We decided to try the other pool (the one with the slide), because it did have a bar and music.  We thought if we stayed on the non-slide side it wouldn't be too bad.  And we were right.  Not too many kids.  We enjoyed our time there and had lunch by the pool which was served to us in our lounge chairs.  I had another Mai tai which was minus the delivery fees.  My husband brought his own Bud Lights which we secretly stashed on ice in our beach bag.   The resort was clean and well maintained.  We didn't have breakfast or dinner there, but lunch by the pool was very good.  Probably won't go back due to the lack of the adult pool, but overall it is a nice resort."}
{"text":"DO NOT -- I REPEAT - DO NOT trust these people connected to Litchfield's, the restaurant on site at the Wigwam. I married my childhood sweetheart on New Year's Day in our home. The Wigwam (Litchfield's) made us sign a contract to have our wedding dinner there, and then decided to close the restaurant for the day (New Year's Day) 36 HOURS before my wedding. There is no excuse for this. The very first thing we asked was whether the restaurant would be open for NY Day. The answer was a resounding \"Yes\" , next came the contract and this was months in advance. However, they had no problem ruining my wedding dinner. They shipped us off to Red's BAR & Grill for the dinner and the ambiance was in the negative category. They assured us it would be great. They did not decorate the table except to plop a poinsettia left over from Christmas in the middle. They used 3 of the 24 roses we bought them to decorate the cake and kept the rest. When we asked for them to be brought out, the manager brought the roses in the original plastic wrap and plopped them into a bucket on a side table - - UGH! It was unbelievably disappointing. It is so inappropriate to have a wedding dinner in a golf club bar, however we had no choice. No one offered to compensate us in any way. Bad show Wigwam -- you ruined my wedding dinner. PS - Then we stayed there on our wedding night in a boring, cold room overlooking the pool - nothing cozy about it. YUCK all over the place. This joint is good for conferences and that is it! Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for 20 years but this was my first stay at the Wigwam. I attended a 3 day conference at the resort and I was pleasantly surprised how nice it was. The rooms are modern, clean and the beds super comfortable. I enjoyed the pool area ( they have 3)  they have a water slide for the kids and a poolside bar for the adults. One evening we went to Litchfield's restaurant located in the resort. Absolutely wonderful food! We enjoyed steaks, seafood with a great atmosphere and great service. All of the staff was super friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend a stay here."}
{"text":"My friends are I were up at the Wigwam for a concert at one of their ballrooms. The resort was surprising. Per its namesake, one expects some sort of tacky Wigwam-type lodging, but to our pleasant surprise, it was a spacious resort on beautiful grounds.   Membership has its privileges, so lucky for me that the Wigwam is a  Starwood property and me being Platinum member - it was a perfect marriage! We scored a 2-bedrroom suite - it was almost like having our own house on the property.   Each room has it's own walk in closet, double sinks and 24-Hour Room Service.  The grounds were impeccable, you can always see a gardener working on the lawns or the beautiful roses that define this resort. Big plus is that they have an excellent steakhouse and an Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa is on-site and right next door to our building. (see my separate reviews on those!)   I look forward to coming back next year. I enjoyed the photos taken circa 1920s displayed in the hallways. The room was spacious, the beds very, very comfortable, the staff is very friendly and housekeeping was attentive to our requests. I'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"My dad got a really good deal on this hotel so they stayed here for 2 nights for a staycation. He invited me to come and visit them and swim too. It was very nice. The pool has a kid section 3 ft. with a water slide and 5 ft. deep for adults. The pool was heated but I'd rather have the water a little bit colder during summer because it was really hot when I came, 116 record breaking temperature. I also went inside their room and it was nice and big. My dad mentioned that he got a room upgrade, I checked out the bathroom and it was big too, it has a tub and a separate shower. I will watch out for good deal and stay here."}
{"text":"This review may not accurately portray the resort because it involves a planned event/conference. We stayed here last year during the same period and it was excellent. The grounds are nice - a large, sprawling complex that can be a little confusing at night. Two nice pools, a life size chess site and spacious rooms are all very impressive. The catered meals were great last year and we were able to check into our rooms early. This year, not so much. Our meetings were finished at noon, but the rooms originally would not be ready until 4pm. Later it was changed to 2pm. Some reservations for our group were not made correctly and resulted in issues. When we called about our room the day before check in, there was a long delay in actually reaching someone. The evening of the first night I attempted to place a wakeup call, but no one answered. The food this year was weak. The first day breakfast was a small continental breakfast. Lunch was a house sandwich - slices of bread, deli meat, tomato and lettuce...I would have made that in my refrigerator at home. The swordfish and nice vegetables of last year were replaced with hors d vores this year. It felt like bar food at happy hour. I didn't stay for lunch the next day - it was a sacked lunch with what I heard was a wrap. Dinner was descent with made to order pasta stations, but really it was mostly just the pasta with very little side dishes. Housekeeping was unpredictable. Day 2 it was after 1:00 and they still hadn't been in our room, but Saturday they were knocking on the door at 8:05 am.   The internet access is $8 per day; the fitness center $15.There were hardly any items in the gift shop, which last year was full.  I know our total bill was high and compared to last year I had high expectations for another great weekend. The resort is in bankruptcy and being auctioned in the next few weeks. Comparing the stay this year to last year, it appeared they were cutting corners. I did not use the spa or the golf course to see how those services compared, but the services such as event planning and housekeeping were a come down from previous years."}
{"text":"We loved it so much we booked our second stay before leaving!   I'm surprised to see any negative reviews for The Wigwam, I just find it absolutely impossible not to love this place with excellent customer service and accommodations.   We are beyond floored with Wigwam. From the moment we pulled into the resort to the very second we sadly had to leave, the service and friendliness was extraordinary!  Our check in took all of two minutes if that, the staff members escort you to your suite, settle you into your room and truly go over and beyond their job! We had a list of requests for our stay and all of them were met plus more!   Amenities: Fitness Center: Very clean and machines are in good shape. Two things that were ekky was guests leaving towels and water cups on the machines.  Pool: Beautiful!   Wifi: Free and fast despite the windy mornings.  Pet friendly!: Our pup received the same welcome that we did! A little pup treat, bottled water and baby talk. Which our dog loves!   There is also plenty of parking steps away from your room. So much to do on site that you really don't need to leave the resort.   I have an app counting down the days till we are back. We miss The Wigwam!!!  Thank you to all of the staff for always being so friendly and for making our stay so enjoyable. You guys rock!"}
{"text":"The real Arizona deal. At amazing prices. Red Arden spa is incredible. Take time to spend in the lobby - talk to Les the historian. Let me show you around. Look at photos. Breathe the fresh air and history. Food at Litchfield's is superb. Eat at bar. Happy hour even. $4 glasses of good wine. Pools and relaxation. Who needs Palms Springs??"}
{"text":"I just visited The Wigwam for the first time and will never stay anywhere else when visiting Arizona. The staff is top notch! They are friendly and on top of every thing. The grounds were impeccable! The pools were gorgeous and the courtyard bar was perfect for all ages. Our teenagers loved being able to watch live music! The rooms were super clean and the beds very comfortable. I especially loved the one story rooms. To be able to walk out your door and be outside on your patio enjoying the weather was amazing. We played bocce ball and watched football and swam and sat in the sun. The Christmas decorations were beautiful. Overall, a five star stay and I can't wait to go back. Thank you to all who work at The Wigwam!"}
{"text":"Review for wedding reception: when looking at venues I called to make an appt but was told no way without the bride.  She said look online at info. I did but asked to see the party rooms and was told to just look myself. Ok I tried that but after walking forever past locked ballroom after meeting room after conference room the resort was just too big and confusing and I felt guests would be all scattered and not at the wedding! I've been to nice events there like the Diamond ball and Corp xmas parties and the resort is lovely but I was turned off. We went with Wedgewood Weddings at Palm Valley golf...more intimate, great packages and two more reasonably priced hotels right across the street."}
{"text":"So clearly I did not get one of the pictured rooms. The rooms are spacious, quiet, comfortable and have a cool little patio out front however, some are clearly still in the queue for revamp. That said, it was abundantly clear that people do not stay here to camp out in the rooms.  The pool area is very family centric during the day has tons of activities to keep them entertained just in case you might have something else to do (golf?).  At night, the grounds come to life in an entirely different manner. A lively bar area, a little band.. all cool but the sitting areas scattered about the property are what really appealed to me. Most of them have fire pits of various design drawing you in with a warm glow. (I found myself drawn into several) Whether I wanted to be right in the middle of the action or off for a little quiet time, I had no trouble finding exactly what I wanted.  The place is a little pricey and for that, the rooms should present better but overall, I had a great experience.    There were issues at first and those were quickly addressed by the staff. The first room had a strong smell of a futile attempt to de-smoke a room. They moved me straight away to a room just a couple doors down sans smokey smell.  I had already written a relatively scathing review based solely on the condition of the room and price paid that did not adequately reflect the overall experience at the resort or with the staff once given the opportunity to deal with the issues. Ask first, yelp later. This is a very cool place to hang at night.   In full disclosure to follow yelp guidelines, my room was comped leaving me with a moral dilemma. I had already tried to rewrite my review before I knew that but was not allowed to post it for some reason."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to stay with years of fabulous history! Entire staff was super cool and friendly! We stayed an extra night because we loved the hotel and grounds so much. Rooms are large and beds were MOST comfortable. A big  thank you to Lisa, front desk manager for making our stay even better. Red's bar has great food and service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a bunch of pre-madonnas on here...i had to pos after reading about \"horrible\" experiences and having syayed here recently.  If you all had a truely horrible experience then you have lived a priveledged life and should try living out of your comfort zone where life can really be \"horrible\" at some place and for some people.  Wigwam is beautiful. Clean. Pools are great. Staff is at least pleasant. Food id better than average. It beats stauing at a hampton inn for a few dollars less. Rooms are clean...ill come back anytime...get off ur high horses people...u need a really check of what truly is and is not horrible in life."}
{"text":"Stayed for an overnight girls staycation. The Oasis rooms are great, easy access to the adult pool. Plenty of loungers and shade. (The only negative was that the adult pool bar closed at 5pm... on a Sat!). But we survived with our own beverages. The front desk was very accommodating. I believe the gentleman's name was Jorge that switched me from an upstairs room to a downstairs room without a problem. The next day I asked for 12pm check out and a pool key so we could hang out a bit longer and they were happy to accommodate us. Also, the breakfast buffet at Red's was delicious! We had a great stay! Will staycation here again for sure."}
{"text":"Beautiful, well manicured property.  Serene and scenic.  Food is delicious and there are serious golfers."}
{"text":"I would never suggest this resort to a friend.  The rooms were old and gross.  The carpet was crusty when I walked on it, the conditioner bottle was half used, and the bathroom tile grout was missing/dirty.   The amenities sounded nice, but they were all booked.  No pedicure, manicure, cabana, pool chair, etc. even when calling ahead.  There is a resort fee, so plan on paying it if you want internet, use of the fitness center or even to park your car.  So you are paying a premium to stay at a resort, but you can't use the amenities and even if they were available you have to pay for them again.  Definitely not a four star resort.  Maybe half a star, it had a bed."}
{"text":"Review of our stay this past spring training - March, 2014.   For some perspective, we are a family of 4, me and the wifee, a 4 year old boy and a 13 month old boy...  So many good things about this place, but on this trip here (our second), there were also some surprising and negative experiences. Its amazing how black a mark one scour or ugly face or shockingly negative attitude can make on an otherwise wonderful experience.   Like I said, this was our second trip to the Wigwam, having stayed her two years ago, almost to the weekend (we come for all the spring baseball).   Most importantly, so much praise and thanks go to Christine out by the pool. She was lovely to us from day one, and even managed to salvage one of the negative experiences we had over the weekend single-handly, and after people that I'd guess were her superiors failed to even show that they cared. Thank you.    To sum up our negative experience, just avoid everyone at the front desk at all costs. One female in particular seemed to think I had asked for her first born child, instead of a ping pong ball. Also, wifi, really guys... this is severely lacking.   On the positive - and there are many, full disclosure - again, PING PONG! Outside in the courtyard, and bocce ball, and oranges... just in a basket, refreshed every day. and they sell smores kits for the fire pit! YEAH! And the pool is wonderful, with a great slide and a smaller water-play area for the very young. And You can get a DVD and rent DVDs for you room for FREE! Bye-bye VOD! And a DJ that was totally family friendly.   I started this review right after our trip, and I had it at 3 stars. I give it 4 now because of (a) Christine, who should be the damn manager of something there, and (b) the sum of the good parts is greater than just them together. This place really has some magic to it. Just be ready for a less than perfect experience."}
{"text":"We were here for the Mother's Day Brunch.  We enjoyed the very nice crab claws and prime ribs, there were no hot gourmet meat or pasta dishes or veggie options other than mashed potatoes, steamed asparagus/carrots and simple lettuce salad. We were not greeted with by flustered greeters and the overall service was less than stellar and they added an automatic 20% gratuity on the bill & gave us the bill w/o asking if we even wanted coffee or anything else.  To being, our waitress gave us some water and was leaving until we asked where do we begin bec there was no introduction of herself or the buffet.  She did not know to familiarize us on their setup... when asked, she didn't think they had starters/appetizers at all until I gave her examples of what that meant and she did speak English, ....just poorly trained holiday help probably.  It came up to $135 for 2, no alcohol included.  I thought it was obnoxious for them to automatically added the 20% gratuity which is not the industry standard for self service buffet for a party of 2 and for below par service by untrained staff?  The 5 star Short Hills Hilton (1 of only 22 in the US with this rating) does not do that and they treat u like royalty, I guess there is no stiff competition in AZ and that is horrible that they get away with it!  The place needs updating for sure bec the paint just looks tired!  Lastly, one of the staff members kept squeezing herself behind me 3 times between my and another diner's seat which was positioned too closed together when the staffer should have gone another route w/o disturbing us our dining experience; she appeared very annoyed by us that we caused her to slow down her very busy job; very unprofessional wait and service staff!  I was appalled by this as I've been to many fine dining 5 star hotel resorts esp in the NY/ NJ area and never ran into such poorly trained staff as what I found here.  The counter serving staff was very nice on the other hand."}
{"text":"the rooms are a bit dated and could use a refresh. The grounds are beautiful, the food very nice. This is a great place for a business conference, but I would find a resort closer to the action if I were on vacation."}
{"text":"This place is definitely geared towards retirees and businessmen, but is very clean and well appointed.  The rates are competitive, as far as resorts go.  The room was extremely spacious and comfortable.  The bathroom was larger than my bedroom, complete with oversized standing shower, spa tub, and seperate toilet area.  Overall I was extremely pleased."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Hotel and convention area.  Had a conference there for 3 days.  Nice facilities."}
{"text":"The room we were originally assigned was in no way what I would expect from a 4-star resort. However, we requested to be moved and our new room was exactly what I was expecting when I booked the hotel. The room overlooked the Oasis Pool and was quiet, clean and large with a huge bathroom and high ceilings. It was very comfortable, except the couch, it was pretty firm to sit on. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"In the area for a business meeting and our host reserved our rooms here, as well as a meeting room and a couple of meals on site.  The room was comfy, and check in went fairly easy.  The majority of our little group was placed in the same general area, which was nice since the property is massive.    The pools were easy to get to, although the hours seemed off since it was early September and in the high 70's that week... those of us coming from cooler climates would have enjoyed being able to use the pool until dark, or close to it.    Staff was pleasant and friendly.  We utilized the bar a few times, as well as the on-site restaurant.  Everything was very well prepared, garnished, and accompanied with the appropriate sides.  There were staff *literally* everywhere you looked.  Landscapers on golf carts, housekeeping on other types of carts, 12 passenger carts ferrying guests from one end of the resort to the other... its a busy place!    We wouldnt complain at staying here, again... but it isnt our first choice, either.  It is in desperate need of updating through most of the property yet you will pay a premium charge for your time there.  Oh, and I had forgotten a swimsuit so I went into the little store on-site to purchase one (fully prepared to pay more than the suit was worth considering it was a resort shop) but all they had were some childrens suits, and some that were clearly for a crowd much more mature than I (and I am almost 40)... and those that were adult sized and ugly they only carried in a Large or Xtra-Large.  So a childs XL is clearly too small, but an adult L is also clearly too big... nothing in-between.  Not even mens shorts in a small, or childs boy shorts in an XL."}
{"text":"My family of five stayed here the weekend before my graduation. Every single staff member was beyond kind and gracious. All the staff treated my three children with respect and not annoyance. There was so much to do, the rooms were clean, pool areas were incredible and well maintained, the room service was timely and food was better than most. Litchfield's was exceptional. Red's Bar and Grill was not to our liking. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the Wigwam! Friendly staff, amazing rooms! I fell in love with the history of the resort. I highly recommend checking out this resort especially if you are looking for a wedding venue."}
{"text":"Spent two nights here for a family event.  Since I love older resorts and historical sites this type of hotel was a perfect choice. Check in was quick and getting a roll away bed was no problem. The grounds are well kept and the style Territorial or SW is so charming.  The pool we visited was the kid-friendly one that has two waterslides.  The ONLY exception to the stellar customer service however occurred at the pool. Our server was a very young (16?) girl who took our drink order and disappeared for 25 minutes. Keep in mind that it is at this point 103 degrees in the shade. And she didn't seem to be busy at all as we could see her from where we were sitting.  My husband noted that many hotels and resorts now include a 20 percent gratuity automatically and that it was unfortunate because servers aren't incentivized to provide a good customer experience.   Finally he got up and walked over to the bar and simply asked the bartender for his drink. The young girl seemed to disappear as he walked up. A few minutes later my husband had his  drink and returned to our spot at the pool when a more mature server (Christine maybe?) greeted us and apologized for her coworkers lack of service. She was from Chicago as is my husband and they chatted for a moment. Later we confirmed that the 20 gratuity was not included but that younger server was probably not well-suited for her job."}
{"text":"We recently stayed here for 3 days. While it's a little dated, this place has great character and was definitely a good get-away. The grounds are spectacular and the staff seemed on top of their game. I'd definitely stay again!"}
{"text":"Welts on entire body from being bit by ants and bed bugs in the bed.  Stolen property and hotel refused to replace.  Rats in restaurant closeby.  Jets in Jacuzzi did not work near room 638.  The stonework near pool is too slippery and doesnt seem safe.  The hotel was very unprofessional.  Refused to switch rooms in middle of night without an investigation done at 6am in the middle of my sleep by security which is ridicilous and lasted 45 minutes.  Ants crawled all over bathroom towels, every crevice.  Avoid staying here.  I was ordered off property after calling repeated times expecting a resolution of replacement for stolen property.  It was my worse stay anywhere.  Ruined my relationship with my friend.  They refuse to pay to have my clothes cleaned from eggs of bugs from the room or for my stolen property.  Worst stay anywhere.  I had my luggage treated by a pest company that confirmed the welts were from bed bugs.  A few were found on my bag.  Hotel refuses to pay the pest company.  Says reports they took are priopriatary.  If you stay be warned.  They will not honor if something goes wrong.  Swarthy people."}
{"text":"Considered a Historic Hotel of America. Built in the early 1900s, and originally owned by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber company. It is said it was built to house the sales executives of Goodyear. Company president Paul Litchfield (the city named after him and he a descendant of the mayflower occupants apparently) was supposedly convinced to make the location a winter retreat and the Wigwam resort was open for business in 1929. 440 acres, very beautiful. If you golf there are 3 courses for you.   Found this Gem through Hotwire.com. It has been fun picking a 4 or 5 star and not knowing where you are going to end up. The Wigwam was a pleasant surprise.   We got here around 7pm but it was dark so it was hard to see the resort and all its glory. When we showed up we were greeted by someone and was pointed into the direction of the reception area. When we entered I noticed free oranges on a table that some dude decided he wanted them and took them all. Not sure why he was being so greedy. It was late so maybe he figured there wasn't going to be anyone that wanted them but it was still weird and tacky.    I rushed to the bathroom since I had been holding it during the drive and noticed SportsCenter in the bathroom mirror. How awesome is that. Of course I took a picture!!  Originally was given room 355. Was driven there in a golf cart. Valet parking is free. Of course, it is common courtesy to tip though. The Valets always seemed surprise to get the tip. Maybe it isn't so common??.  Weird old antique musty smell to room. I was hoping it could be aired out. Never had the chance to find out because we had to switch rooms. We reserved two queens but the room had only one king. (have kids so need two beds)   We were moved to Room 348. Took a while since the golf cart battery ran down. Waited outside a bit and eventually went back into the smelly Room 355 because it was a crisp 52 degrees and felt even colder. Room 348 had the same antique musty smell too, just not as potent. Luckily overtime the smell got better, or I just got used to it and didn't notice it anymore. Looked up smelly hotel rooms and read that it is caused by mold, humidity, and a lack of ventilation. Whatever.   The beds have 8 pillows 4 were decorative. The room looked fine. HDtv with HD channels (a thing for me. no standard definition on a High Definition TV. Just makes no since.)  On the dresser there were 2 water bottles and 2 bags of trail mix $5 a piece. We left them alone. A bit pricey, we just got our snacks from the Walgreens around the corner. Called the front desk and had a mini fridge and a microwave brought to the room. Still tipped and still got that startled surprise. Maybe they were doing it because I don't look like a guy that would tip. lol  I noticed strangely that the doors do not seem to fit in the doorways. Not just the regular doors but all doors. Cabinet doors, closet doors, even the shower door didn't fit its frame. It was as if someone choose the door but didn't measure it probably. Wasn't a big deal but still seemed off.   The bathroom was cool. The shower had marble looking tiles and a large square shower head from Delta. It felt like showering in the rain. It was wonderful actually. I didn't want to leave the shower, plus while you are in there you can't smell the room. I am going to the Home Depot to find this shower head!    The rest of the bathroom had a nice modern style look. Definitely upgraded.   Woke up in the morning and was able to see the resort and all its beauty. I know what lush greens mean from walking outdoors. Just a really pretty place. While walking to the main office I noticed gingerbread houses. Got closer and what do you know they were Real Gingerbread houses!!!! What tipped me off? The hundred bees that were feeding off the gingerbread houses. Not a smart idea.   Small Rant* Not only was the smell bothering me for a few days (I stayed 4) But I started itching the first night too. It was just weird. It did get better and it didn't effect the way I reviewed the Wigwam. (I think I grew accustomed to the smell).  End Small Rant*  There are 3 pools on site. The Oasis (I am guessing the older pool that has been upgraded.) I was told it is unofficially the adult pool. The other pool site has a section of it for children called the kids corner which has water slides. It has a booth that serves kid type foods. A nice touch. I am told by the locals that this area is new. There is a bar off to the side and a bit further they have The Wigwam Bar. Very nice for adults. There is one other pool called the Spa pool. I have seen pictures and it looks nice. You can only enter the site if you pay for the spa. Maybe next time. The pools are heated by the way.    The Wigwam has an app on App Store and Google play. Very helpful if you want to get around and not sure where things are. There was another bar closer to the spa pool that I didn't get to see. Maybe next time. A+ Staff. Good job Wigwam!"}
{"text":"I came here for a much needed staycation I bought on groupon. Only to find out when I checked in I bought it for the wrong dates and I was almost in tears since I was looking forward to this night. the hotel staff was quick very helpful and able to get us a room last minute close to the adult pool :):) the service was really good at the adult pool and later we wandered to the wine bar where the service was just as fabulous. Don't forget to ask for a az resident discount when you check in. Thank you for making our staycation great!"}
{"text":"Played the Wigwam golf courses during my stay in the valley.  They are by far in the worst condition I have ever seen a course.  The locals have nicknamed it The Pigwam, and members I spoke to are outraged by the new ownership/management's apparent lack of interest in the courses conditions.  The greens were not puttable, punched and sanded but not rolled or cut.  Very little grass in the fairways, and the rough is nothing but weeds of varying heights.  One of the courses is so wet, mowers and golf carts have left huge tire ruts in the muddy rough.  Tree limbs down for days.  Grass growing in all the bunkers.   Large areas of dirt around the greens.  I played several other courses in the valley during my stay, and all were near pristine, with only minor seasonal issues.  Save your money and play elsewhere."}
{"text":"See my review on trip advisor. I came for business, brought my 4yr old and 2yr old. Never a dull moment.  So many activities for the kids. The property is amazing. I have no complaints.  My kids did not complain at all during our week long visit. Ate at Red's,  flavors were on point! My daughter woke up wanting to go to the pool. Everyone was helpful and smiling.  I felt comfortable and safe here. They have holiday lights up through the the resort. I took my kids on a walk every night.  I really enjoyed myself here. Tim and Christine were two people who took the time to stop me and ask about my stay and if there was anything they could do, of course there wasnt!  I was having a blast!! Thank you and I can't wait to come back!  Take the time to explore inside and out. You will not regret it. Wish I could of ate at Litchfield s but, with the little ones I didn't get a chance. Maybe next time.  Forgot to mention i was traveling from California i was very tired and so were my little ones. I arrived at 1 pm and tried my luck to see if i could check in early. Yay i was able too! Not a problem. Also after eating at some great restaurants including reds on site, I had left over and requested a microwave which was brought promptly.  Staff is so friendly."}
{"text":"Went to the bar near the pool and Litchfields. Sitting at a table couldn't get anyone to wait on us, went up to the bar to order food and they never put our food order in. Had to ask multiple times and ended up waiting over an hour for food, while we saw others around us get their food before us. Management knew...not concerned."}
{"text":"Normally this place is a nice place to stay however our most recent stay left me extremely disappointed. First of all they didn't have our reservation when we arrived. My husband and his friend(who frequents the place due to season cardinals tickets) took care of this while my girlfriend and I went to the spa. We arrived over an hour early intending to get a glass of wine and a snack before our 90 min massages. They were not able to accommodate this request. After 45 mins of waiting I tracked down someone, who was not friendly at all. She told me she would send someone over to help me. I was told nicely by this person that there were several weddings going on and that the kitchen was super busy(also she said i should have allowed 30 mins to get my order, which I most certainly did). I then asked if we could at least have the wine and she said that this couldn't happen either. The massage was great but paying for it wasn't. I treated my friend to the massage. I paid this easily. I stood along side my friend as she was purchasing some makeup and The lady ringing her up tried to charge her for her massage. I let her know I already paid for both of our massages her immediate response was \"no you didn't\". She was rude to me and it just added to my already bad experience. The final straw and the reason why I'm writing this review is that we looked at our credit card statement last night. We were charged twice for our one night stay. My husband spoke to accounting today and was told our friends card that they had on file for their stay was declined. The wigwam then took the liberty of charging our card for both rooms! Mind you both rooms were not in my husbands name."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try out the place, it's so beautiful.  So when my sis and hubby came to visit, I suggested we try it out for breakfast at the Arizona Kitchen.  We were a little late for breakfast and got a lunch menu but we really wanted breakfast.  Seeing as we were the only patrons in the place, the chef agreed to turn around the kitchen back to breakfast prep.  If you've ever seen how a kitchen runs, you know it's not just flipping a switch.  I ordered the eggs benedict and was greeted with a scrumptious duo of canadian bacon, just-right eggs, and a hollandaise sauce that could make the Queen mum cry on fluffy english muffins.  But something was missing.  The black truffles that were promised...where were they?  The hostess again remedied the situation and brought back a generous helping of the decadent treat and all was good in Margaret's world.  I think I licked the plate clean.  They didn't even have to wash.  A little pricey, but what do you expect from a resort?  The truffles made up for it and especially the service.   We asked for the chef to the table so that we could offer her our compliments.  Big frou frou expensive looking chef?  NO!  LIttle Chinese woman.  Grandma!  She was more than grateful for the praise we showered on her and I think the three of us were stuffed happily to the gills.  Can't wait for another morning like that!"}
{"text":"Celebrating 30th wedding anniversary and we were SO delightfully surprised and impressed by our stay at the Wigwam.  We had a room located right on the greens of the course with rose lined walk ways.  Wifi signal was good.  Food choices all within a 5 minute walk.  I didn't understand why anyone would take the cart shuttle around the resort and miss out on all the beautiful plants, cactus, birds and sights while walking around the resort.  Housekeeping kept our room pristine.  We swam in the beautiful pools, relaxed and drank our frozen drinks.  Loved sitting out by the Wigwam Bar, listening to great local musicians perform.   A great get away.  Next time we'll bring the whole family.  All positives for our May anniversary visit.  Thank you Wigwam!"}
{"text":"The room was booked through a third party and as many reviews have suggested, when you book through a third party you are given a sub standard room.. Our room was full of cockroaches, and the front desk refused to refund our money.  The room was worn out, and the carpet was dirty.  The shower door was broken, and I was bitten by a brown spider at the pool area.  To boot, a child required paramedics at the children's pool after being found unresponsive in the water in spite of having two life guards present.  All in all, I would never recommend the Wigwam to anyone.  It is unsafe and dirty.  Management is arrogant in their replies and want people to come back in spite of the complaints.  If only management would fix the complaints and compensate people who have had a poor experience adequately."}
{"text":"We booked a room last minute, for a concert nearby. Awesome room at a great rate. The pool is pretty neat, with water slide. The property is very quiet, clean, and laid out with plenty of privacy, more like mini apartments. The only drawback was the lack of close parking. That is mostly made up for, by the awesome attendants with golf carts, who are eager to help with any luggage or walking. Beautiful place, and a historical gem."}
{"text":"When I entered our room I was impressed by the size.  It's very large but I thought the decor was very odd.  Looking toward the bed the room looked very nice.  There's a sitting area and desk. However, when you look at the opposite side of the room, all you see is a large expanse of wall, no artwork, just a too small dresser and television set.  It looks as though they ran out of money to decorate both sides of the room.  Above the bed was a very large, ugly brown beam (a bit unsettling).  The bathrooms were nice except for the fact that the lighting was way too dim.  I had to put my make up on in the closet because that was the most well lit area in my room. Our room also had a very odd smell.  It was something in the carpet.  My first morning there I was awoken by the gardeners mowing the lawn.  This was after a night of listening to the loud music coming from somewhere in the hotel, I think it was the restaurant. The second morning I was awoken by the gardeners talking loudly right outside my room (they were working on the garden).  When you open the door you are in a garden setting with walkways, so you can hear all the noises from outside.  My advice to the hotel would be to tell your staff to have a little consideration for their hotel guests.  Think about the fact that people might be sleeping when they are working right outside their rooms."}
{"text":"Really nice property. A bit traditional in design - furniture is heavy & rooms are dark but comfortable. Nice big bathroom & HUGE shower - loved that.  Staff are very service oriented & friendly. Conference facilities & catering were terrific.  Food (catered & room service) was very good.  I'd definitely stay again."}
{"text":"Never been here, but it is a great place.  Quiet and clean.  Fun pool for the kids.  Great service.  Huge suites to stay in."}
{"text":"The Wigwam has a long history. And a lot of nice people on the staff. and that's it for the positives. Everything is overpriced. The facility is OLD, hence the long history. Minimalism was applied heavily when upgrades were done.  The nostalgic pictures on the wall do nothing to make the place relevant to anyone younger than 50. The A/C units (pretty important in the Arizona desert) are so loud! They are above-window units that make such a racket it wakes almost any sleeping individual up every time they kick on. When trying to enjoy some TV, once they are running the rattling vibration is so loud the TV volume must be raised to a level that one begins to be concerned about disturbing their neighbors. Way overpriced for what a person gets.  WiFi is another pain point. Constantly having to rejoin the network after taking two steps outside the room door. Slow speeds even while in your room which is where WiFi is most often used.  Not a happy camper here. - yeah, almost feels like camping."}
{"text":"We had such a great time! I'm a mom of 2 special needs boys and decided this year we were finally ready to go on a little staycation- this really was a milestone for my little family and I wanted everything to be easy breezy- and fun! The Wigwam welcomed us warmly and we didn't have to lift a finger to get to our room! We enjoyed quite a few meals in our room which were fast, convenient and delicious! We loved having cheese pizza on speed dial for the little ones! Pool side service was friendly and attentive and the food and drinks were delicious as well! The kiddos had a blast swimming and going down the water slides! Also felt the lifeguard was very sweet with my kids! The game arcade came in handy and my boyfriend enjoyed the golf course and staff so much that he played again on Sunday! The room was clean, the beds were comfy and the kids just loved all the activities! Especially seeing all the animals from the Wildlife Zoo!   We will definitely be going back to the Wigwam for more family time!"}
{"text":"I have stayed in Phoenix for work on several locations, The Wigwam is by far the nicest place I have stayed.   Spacious clean rooms, comfortable beds, quiet surroundings, great bartenders and staff. Several places to eat, a fantastic gym that allows you to really sweat!   My favorite place, I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Big fan of The Wigwam, primarily due to excellent golf courses.  Very well maintained, I enjoy all 3 courses immensely.  Staff are friendly and conscientious; looks like they got a new fleet of carts recently, which is nice.  Worth a stop if you're making the rounds of the Valley's courses.  Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"Huge room.  No divider in the room.  But nice!  Food was lame.  Service is great.  Beautiful grounds.  Way too many people in the pool.  Salt water pool was nice but the kids (11 and 16) could not enjoy it.  Glad they shut down the pools at 10 I believe bc we were right next to it.  Great Mexican food joint within walking distance.  Old Pueblo Grill.  Fantastic food in contrast to the overpriced hotel food.  I asked for no egg on their burger for my son.  They gave him the egg.  He did take it off but still didn't like the burger.  My salmon was over salted.  And my husband didn't get salad dressing for his salad.  Lol.  We ate out after that.  Overall, a very touristy place with beautiful grounds."}
{"text":"Wife and I stayed here the other day, and even though we had to leave early, it was a great experience. The bathrooms were amazing! The steak I had at their restaurant was pretty good too. Only downside was the TV. Seemed like a 28 inch crt style tv, but I wasn't there to watch television so it wasn't a big deal. Guy at the steak house suggested a great place to stargaze as well."}
{"text":"Recently stayed at the Wigwam during our vacation to see some Spring Training Baseball. Although the resort is a five star I was not impressed with the rooms. I could have stayed at the Springhill Suites for half the price with the same size room. The rooms were also out dated and are in need of a makeover. Next time I visit Arizona I will select a different hotel."}
{"text":"What can I say? How sweet it is to have this amazing resort within 5 minutes of home. My wife and I could not get out of town for our anniversary due to work stuff, so went with a little staycation. Had a GREAT time and felt like we were hours away from home! Ate dinner across the street and chilled at TAPS for a while. Great place to grab a drink and some light dinner.   Will return often!!"}
{"text":"I stayed here in January when my wife had a business conference to attend.  I loved the throwback, southwest decor and theme of the property.  The rooms were nice and spacious, especially the bathroom.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  The property sprawls a little so there are 4 pools.  We visited 2 of them and were fortunate enough to have warm weather during our stay.  On top of that, the pools are heated nicely, probably to somewhere in the mid to upper 70's.  Some random notes: there are no elevators for the second story rooms.  If you are handicapped or just have a ton of stuff to lug, ask for a room on the first floor.  Along the same line, you have to find parking near your room.  When it's crowded, this may be difficult.  I personally did not see any handicapped parking near our room.  The walk to the main pool was a little trek for me.  To their credit, they do offer golf cart rides if you call.  Lastly, the water slides are turned off for the cold months.  I was told that they don't function until February or March.  I'm not sure when they shut them down."}
{"text":"I loved staying at the Wigwam.  We had stayed at the Clarendon not too long before (read the Clarendon review) and we needed a totally different experience.  The staff was very courteous at check in, and asked if we were celebrating anything important, which we weren't (just a little stay-cation), but my wife did explain that we had a horrible stay at the Clarendon earlier.  I think this prompted them to go out of their way to make us feel even more welcome. They gave us the rundown on anything we needed and insisted that we call for anything at all.  Our room was in a duplex type villa on the far side of the property by the golf course, but the staff made sure to let us know that if we needed to get around the property they would send a golf cart for us.  The room was spotless and the bed was something I could sleep on forever, with luxurious bedding.  The grounds are beautifully kept, and the pools are amazing.  Poolside service for drinks was wonderful, even if you just want some water.  Just an overall amazing experience, with too much to actually write down.   What kills me is that we have lived on the West Side for 10 years now, and had never gone to the Wigwam before that.  Well, I think that trend is over now."}
{"text":"WIGWAM, cookie cutter responded do nothing. Historic doesn't mean unsanitary last I checked.   So, what is your offer? Do I get some type of refund? Offer for complimentary stay with a better room?   Did you see the pictures I posted. What is your response to those?"}
{"text":"The Wigwam resort really was a gem in the west side of the Valley of the Sun. The pool is beautiful with amazing cabanas that light up at night and an array of fountains that just make it all the more enjoyable. The food was high quality each and every time and the front desk service was amazing. I would love to go back and I recommend this place to anyone looking for a retreat with Southwest Charm and ambiance. Enjoy yourselves!!"}
{"text":"Booked a room last minute for our anniversary.  Very disappointing. The room was outdated and uninviting.   The service at Litchfield's was bad.  The food was even worse. Will not go back"}
{"text":"Staycation's all I ever wanted.  Staycation had to get away!  And Happy happy happy I did.    I stayed at the Wigwam for the AZ Jazz festival this past October.  One of my most memorable experiences about this resort was the fact that I arrived after dark on the first night.  I went to the first concert that night and enjoyed the evening.   I didn't think much about the property at all.  I woke up the next morning to take a walk around and see what I could grab for breakfast.  I walked out of my casita to find that that resort is a green lush of beauty suitable for the most discerning eye!  I was WOWed by how well kept the property was.   The property is well manicured with beautiful huge palm trees everywhere.      I was very pleased with the quality of service I received at all the various points that I interacted with the staff of the Wigwam.  From the housekeeping to the bar/restaurants to the bell hops who shuttled us around in their golf carts (yes, you can call the bell hops to pick you up or drop you off).  The staff was catering to thousands of people on the property there for the AZ Jazz festival as well as the hundreds of patrons who were actually staying at the resort.  I think that everyone I encountered handled that influx of people well.  Albeit, the rooms are somewhat outdated, you're not staying in an actual wigwam either!  The rooms were fairly large.  Actually, in comparison to a standard hotel room, these rooms are pretty large.  All of the casitas have these wonderful patios and my friends and I sat out there and chatted in the AZ sun!   Keep in mind that this is a historic hotel.  There are a lot of fun facts to learn when you are walking around the hotel about the hotel and the city of Litchfield and Goodyear.    There are several food options on the property and several that are right outside of the gates of the property on Old Litchfield Rd.  Since I never moved my car the 3 days I was there, I did eat at all of the resorts restaurants and some along Old Litchfield.    I realize this is getting long!  But there are a lot of things I loved about this place.  I loved the fact that the main house/lobby of the resort has all these little conversation nooks all over the place.  The lobby, if you can call that a lobby as it is huge, is so cozy and has a delectable southwestern theme to it.   Property - 5 Stars Rooms - 3.5 Stars Food Options - 4 Stars Quality of Service - 4 Stars. Golf  - ?? I'll try to do that when I return."}
{"text":"Had an amazing stay at the Wigwam, near the Dodgers/White Sox spring training facility at Camelback ranch.  All the amenities, pool (there are two), gym, entertainment where great.  The room was spacious and clean, and in keeping with the adobe western theme of the Wigwam.  The rooms are booked solid - way in advance this time of year.  I will be back, if there is a vacancy."}
