{"text":"The quality of food surpasses Kanda and Sushi St.Jean hands down.  We were impressed with how fresh everything was. The staff were friendly and attentive and the service was fast.  The only downside is that they don't have tablets as yet so there was a bit of confusion.  Still give then a five star. They are still fairly new so hopefully the quality stays the same in the future."}
{"text":"Food was really great especially for an all-you-can-eat place, the service was excellent despite being tremendously busy. A really great value with an excellent variety including some very good tar-tar. Will be back."}
{"text":"Bad service. Rude employees. Our fried sushi was cold and returned to us microwaved. Ask for wooden chopsticks, theirs are not clean."}
{"text":"Just wow. I was really impressed with this all you can eat sushi place. I went with people who have experienced a lot of all you can eat sushi places and they also liked it. The food, mostly the sushi and the lamb skewers were simply incredible.  Another thing to note is the speed of the service. Usually in an all you can't eat place, you order and in between the time they bring the plates you have time to finish the first one and digest before they bring the next one. Not here. The service was so fast we were not able to finish the plates before the new one got to our table. At one point we did not even have enough place on the table for the plates."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Sunday and were pleasantly surprised.  The place is clean and the service is quick (with the exception of our last order of dessert which took way longer than expected).  Food is good for AYCE sushi.  By 1h30 pm there was a line up so get there early if you can.  Tip for restaurant management: The quicker you serve the desserts, the quicker the table will clear for new customers.  Please pay close attention to this.  I would definitely come back here for good AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of these all you can eat but we tried once with wife and kids and I have to admit it was the best one I've tried. You have a little tablet to order, and once you press confirm the food literally appears on the table 4 seconds after. Never seen food go out this fast. It was good, nothing to write home about but good. If you're into that kind of offering, try this one I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi place so far in mtl. We were really hungry and my friend brought us to this place. The quality of the food is better than other AYCE. While we were ordering on the tablet, the waiter asked us to move to another table because people already reserved a table. We didn't mind, but he came back with the drinks menu and told us that we could ordered any drinks (on the house). We didn't expect anything but it was thoughtful of them! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm picky, especially when it comes to seafood and sushi. I've always loved the \"all you can eat\" styles and love that it actually satisfies me. I do prefer \"a la catre\" for reasons of freshness and taste... but after trying this place.. they got me.  Going to kanda and sushi st jean many many many.....many times. I wanted to change and find a place where I can try new sushi from a different style.  The place looks really nice and modern will spaces for big parties or just with your significant other.  The food is really good and seems to be at it's best when the time counts (dinner time rush). Spicy tuna, salmon and their variety of hot dishes and raw fish where good! Cons. Now I don't usually say this but service was a little bit everywhere... I know all you can eat can be very hectic but I feel that they should have 1 or 2 waiters per section to avoid asking the same question to 5 different waiters and getting different answers from all of them.  Over all I loved my experience and can't wait to go back!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went to Matsuno last week with two friends since one of us heard about this place and wanted to give it a try.   I must say, the interior is quite elegant and simple.. It stands out better than other all you can eat sushi restaurants, it also looks clean!   The service is quick and the staff were very helpful. I did like the menu because it has more variety ans better choices with more cuisine and seefood options :) Mussels done with wasabi sauce are a beauty!   It is in West Island, the land of nowhere .. But well I go back there or do I recommend it to someone else? Certainly, I would :)"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat sushis, especially at dinner time because the options are nicer. Would definitely recommend the salmon tartare, really good !!! Service is ok, a bit slow."}
{"text":"Came in for a big supper after a long road trip. The service was fast and the food was good. A surprisingly wide range of food, with some great maki rolls."}
{"text":"One of my new favourites all-you-can-eat sushi! I've been to tons in downtown, and this one tops them all (Zushi, Sushi Crescent, Kanda, Sushi Sainte-Catherine). Everything tastes fresh here. Though some dishes are of smaller quantity than other sushi buffets, the quality here is much better. Would def recommend."}
{"text":"Well that was a lot of hype for sure.  We went for lunch so it's a slightly smaller menu I think. The sushi was limited in scope and looked and tasted about as average as every other AYCE place really. The non sushi items were generally just ok however the sesame beef was quite good.  The beef ramen was disgusting though. Maybe it's as I didn't expect a weird soupy thing. The peanut butter dumplings were more spic than peanut butter as well. The service is fast and they tell you what they're brining but it was mumbled. What brought it down is we got there about 2 for lunch. They sat us down no problem and we ordered,  they forgot a couple of dishes which was fine as I don't stress on that in an AYCE place but when I tried to order more they asked if that was it as it was last call.  Perhaps tell people that before sitting down to begin with so they know they're on a clock?  Was decent but won't be running back."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place, so my family and i decided to give it a try today. We arrived at 12:30 and the place was full. The hostess told us there is a 30 minutes wait, so we decided to be patient. While we were waiting, i noticed that there was customers who were eating there alone or with another person on tables made for 4. Also, there was a big group of people sitting on joined tables made for two. I guess if they organised that in better way, customers wouldn't have to wait too long to get a table. Anyways, after 30-35 minutes, we got our table.  Food: very very good! We really were surprised by the quality and the presentation of the plates. They don't toss the food on plates and bring it to you, they take the time to make it look nice. They have many choices and you can feel the freshness in everything.  Service: Pretty good service even if they were really busy. They have a lot of staff and they are really kind. They are very fast and don't leave empty plates on the table for too long.  The restaurant is very clean, i am totally giving it another shot, i'll just probably make sure to have a reservation next time to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and I found that the food was good. The place got crowded very fast. We showed up around 11:45am for lunch and we got a seat right away but 30 minutes later, there were people waiting to be seated.  Unlike Sushi St-Jean a few blocks away, there is plenty of parking in front of Matsuno.  Matsuno is an AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi place where you pick your tickets from a piece of paper and they bring the items to you. I found the food to be good but I wasn't overly impressed with the service since we had to ask for our items (soup at the beginning and ice cream at the end) a few times before these items were brought to us.  I found that the food was very good. Excluding the fact that we had to ask for our soup (at the beginning) and our ice cream (at the end) multiple times, I didn't have any issues. If they were better with bringing the items, I would rank them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty awful sushi to say the least. Watered down soya sauce. Everything looks old. Brown avocados in my sushi. Dried out brown wasabi. Waiters constantly hovering over the table made me uncomfortable. I work in the service industry. I understand the need to give good service but to be constantly being looked over and interrupted while eating is not enjoyable. Also the sushi is lathered in mayo making it impossible to grab with chop sticks and makes for a strange texture in my mouth. You can't taste the fish. All you can taste is mayo. Don't order anything with tuna in it the tuna is light pink and translucide. I thought it was salmon at first. Just all around bad. There are so many better sushi restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"One of my favourite west island spot for all you can eat sushi. So fresh, clean and good service. Shrimp tempura are to die for, not too oily just made to perfection. Very good selection!!"}
{"text":"Another AYCE sushi joint in West Island!   I've tried many all you can eat sushi places all over Montreal, and this would be one of my new favourites. Their fish (especially sashimi) tasted pretty fresh and their sushis were delicious and the perfect size. What surprised me the most was their fried chicken katsu, which was quite flavourful and not dry. Their teriyaki's may not be the best, but their other menu items make up for it. And lastly, they have a good variety of ice cream, even offering fried ice cream for 5$ extra.   Coming on a Saturday evening, ofc will be packed but the wait time for a seat didn't take too long. Despite other reviews, the waiters were pleasant but were all over the place, so it took almost an hour just to pay and leave.   Overall, this place is a good AYCE sushi joint in West Island to try out! If you're a group of 4 or more, reservations would be a good idea."}
{"text":"When they first opened, the food was incredibly to die for. You could order on an iPad whatever you wished and there were endless selections. We went again today and they samsung pads now, which doesn't bother me. However the menu on it is extremely limited. You can't even get avocado rolls, or cucumber rolls anymore. There are no tempuras in that \"tablet\" menu either. The staff is very friendly but I do wish that they went back to their old menu. I was a bit disappointed tonight."}
{"text":"One of the best all you can eat sushi I've had in the West Island. Great Service and staff. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"honestly maybe it's because i received so much hype about this place but i was disappointed after eating here especially comparing it to other AYCE sushi places in the west island, i find there wasn't many options for actual sushi rolls and they didn't taste that good and i found it took a while to receive my food it was so awkward i kept bumping my chair into the people behind me but she was kinda cute ngl but forreal forreal there are better places to eat foo"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's very nicely decorated with a modern look. It's clean as well and is decently sized. You order on tablets which make it a lot easier to browse the menu and order.  FOOD: This is my go-to spot for sushi. They have the freshest fish in the West Island and probably any other all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant that I've ever been to. They also display their sushis as if you were in a higher-end restaurant as well. I do find their fried sushis too greasy though compared to other restaurants. At dinner time, you can order salmon tartar (which is delicious) and you can order torched salmon sashimi which is honestly the best thing I've ever had. My mouth waters just thinking about it!  PRICE: Lunch time and dinner time prices are the standard prices compared to all the other all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants.   SERVICE: It's a little bit hard to grab a waiter's attention at times but I understand it's because they're so busy. Overall though, their staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Yes! It's true! It is the best all you can eat sushi in the west island, possibly in Montreal. Great selection. There's something about the rice! Some of the sushi looks and tastes like what I ate in Japan. Warm meals are excellent as well. Green tea and mango ice cream was delishisly refreshing. Overall service and quality of food worth the extra few dollars.  Enjoy!"}
