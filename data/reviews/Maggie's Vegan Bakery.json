{"text":"Unbelievably delicious! The sweet potato pecan bread, blueberry bread, double chocolate chip muffin filled with cream cheese! Even the whole wheat bread is special. Of all the bakeries I have been to, this by far is my favorite, considering both vegan and non. Don't pass up the opportunity."}
{"text":"What a gem of a find.  The owner/baker is such a lovely person who truly enjoys what she does. Nice selection of baked goods, and so moist and tasty you would never guess they were vegan.  In the hip Ohio City downtown district, just down from Great Lakes Brewery.  If you are in the area, be sure to stop in and say hello.  You won't be disappointed.  Apparently the phone number is wrong on Yelp though - it is 216.396.8228."}
{"text":"I really wanted to dislike the cupcakes I had from here because to be honest, I roll my eyes pretty hard at vegan lifestyles most times. But the coconut cupcakes were HOMIGOD the BEST! Moist and delicious with tons of awesome frosting. So so good. It's hard not to crave them. I honestly would have never thought they were vegan! Great job! Wow!"}
{"text":"I love the cookies! If you don't have a nut allergy definitely grab an everything cookie or the vegan walnut chip. The zucchini bread is so moist and delicious. The sweet potato muffin was yummy!  The owner is such a doll!"}
{"text":"Started buying Maggie's cupcakes at Constantino's (they have more consistent business hours than her bake shop on W. 25th... ) Anyway, the Vegan Chocolate Cupcake is great.  If you don't get them the day they are baked they will be dry and crumbly.  I could eat the chocolate frosting by the truckload.  The Vegan Vanilla Cupcake and Vegan Red Velvet didn't taste very good to me. They tasted like dry fish food.  The strawberry cupcake was SO good.  Now keep your dirty dish pan hands out of the Constantino's case or I'll knock you out for one of those cupcakes..."}
{"text":"These cookies are amongst the better ones I've had from a bakery; moist and chewy in the middle, but crusty on the outside.  I'd recommend the everything cookie, and the ginger cookie. The proprietor was very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Went looking for it on a Wednesday afternoon. Google led to a residential house and called the number listed from a previous reviewer and it was a strange men's voicemail.   Assumed it's shut down and out of business."}
{"text":"Whole Foods has an okay vegan baked goods selection but it all has a massed produced taste to it (I can pretty much guarantee that their cookies come in frozen and then they put them on a tray and bake them).  You want to know why this place is so awesome?  Because everything has a homemade taste to that you can't get in chain stores.  I've only had the muffins and the cupcakes but if they are any indication of the rest of the products you will not be disappointed.  The muffins and cupcakes are HUGE were talking you need a fork and chances are you won't finish it all huge.  The owner Maggie is usually there and she is really nice.  They almost always have samples out which has gotten me to buy more than what I came in for on more than one occasion.  The one thing I highly recommend is the pumpkin and chocolate chip muffin.  It's like a religious experience. My only complaint is that they don't really have a social media presence.  All they need is a facebook and a twitter to post what they have available for the day.  I'd probably patronize this business more if they utilized those tools."}
