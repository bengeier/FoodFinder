{"text":"I made the mistake of reading the 50-food-and-drink-items-you-should-eat-in-2012 write up (along with delicious pictures!) on cleveland.com.  One of the items that caught my eye was the potato pierogi pizza from P. Jay's Pizza.  The name instantly brought back very fond memories of eating \"pizza skins\" at Pizzeria Uno which I LOVED but can no longer get locally.  Since this pizza shop is right around the corner from my house, I decided to give it a try tonight.  

Ummmm.....YUM!  I liked it a lot.  Of course, I was starving so maybe I liked it more than I might have if I were just merely hungry.  The pizza is made with butter sauce, mashed potatoes, sauteed onions, butter, and cheddar cheese.  I was concerned that this might be way too buttery and greasy but they use just the right amount of butter/sauce to make my taste buds happy without overpowering me with grease.  The layer of potatoes was just the right amount and creamy smooth.  Onions were soft but not mushy and not overpowering.  Just enough cheese topped it all off.  It's served with packets of sour cream.  The crust was one of those good not-too-thick/not-too-thin local pizza shop crusts.  It wasn't the BEST I've ever had but still good.  All in all, the pizza was flavorful, filling, and warmed up my belly.

The people in the shop were pleasant and on the ball.  I noticed quite a few of the employees on duty this evening appeared to be high school age.  I like that - kids need jobs and a pizza shop is a great place for them!  One note, they do not accept credit cards so have cash handy.  I made the mistake of only having cards and had to run to the ATM next door.  My fault for not paying attention when ordering.  

I'll be back P. Jay's.  You pleased my taste buds and my tummy.  I'm happy to be supporting a neighborhood shop (across from another fav - Sittoo's!)"}
{"text":"Crap disguised as award winning pizza......raw supermarket dough crust...generic pepperoni...bland sausage....wake up Cleveburghers....guy has a great game going here...doesn't take charge cards but invites you to use the ATM that he owns right by the register at 2 bucks a pop.....Ka-Ching!!!"}
{"text":"The best meal for the price. spaghetti and pizza was perfect. Finally another great pizza shop in parma. They came recommended by a manger of pizza hut and he was right"}
{"text":"This place is a family go to when we are in Parma. Bulk sausage formed into large medallions, perfectly cooked golden brown crust. My only complaint is more personal preference cuz I always forget to get an extra side of sauce.  Not sure what the other reviews are complaining about with rude staff? We have been ordering from this place for decades and have yet to encounter that kind of behavior."}
{"text":"Years ago this place was decent. Recently it has gone to the wayside. I ordered a stromboli and a dozen garlic wings, the cost was just under 18$. The wings were obviously recooked and tasted more like chicken jerky. The stromboli was soggy but edible. I've noticed lately they like to precook their pizza, then recook when ordered, very bad idea. I think at the price point the food should be more then just edible. I'll be steering  clear of this place."}
{"text":"Giving this one star bc the people that work there are some of the most rude ive ever met in my life. Pizza is good but it isnt a very inviting place to go"}
{"text":"Cannot understand why there are not more reviews on this place. They have prompt service answering the phone and prompt delivery service. Their employees are personable and reliable. They have specials during lunch time on the sandwiches. I ordered two meatball sandwiches one for my son, one for me and they were delicious with fresh bun. There were plenty of meatballs. I have also had their pizza which is very good and I like it with light sauce and pineapple. It is one of my favorite places to get something to eat. They also have dinners which are also good and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Pj's has consistently had our vote as one of the best pizza places in town. Their crust is to die for.
We usually get the sheet pizzas and they have always been awesome no matter what toppings we get. Ingredients are always fresh. Just love that they use bulk sausage instead of those strange little kibble like sausage!"}
{"text":"Meh. That really does sum up my entire experience.

The large salad (~$5) has a ridiculous amount of cheese, 4 tomato wedges, and lettuce that was wet. They make spin driers for a reason. Great that they do the sanitary thing and wash their lettuce. Most don't.

Got a black olive half sheet pizza (~$16). Pizza was nothing special. In fact it was better cold the next day. It was almost a poor Convenient Food Mart pizza clone. Maybe their normal pizzas are made differently? Doubt we will be back to find out.

Redeeming the experience was the hot wings (~$9/dozen). They actually had a bit of spiciness, which is lacking in the area. This might bring us back. 

Breadsticks (3 for $2.50) were pretty good - light and airy.

Other pluses are the staff is very courteous and this is the only place we've encountered in the Parma area that includes their menu with orders (take note competitors)."}
{"text":"Ordered a large sausage and pepperoni .. excellent pizza in both preparation and flavor. Took away 1 star do to size vs cost.. it was more like a medium compared to the local competition vs the cost"}
{"text":"The customer service at this place is horrific! The manager I dealt with, I believe his name was Chris, was extremely rude and unprofessional. If that is what I can expect from the management at P Jay's then I will most certainly take my business elsewhere. Also the food is only mediocre and definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"My parents wanted to order pizza Friday night and they didn't want to dine in. So I ordered a large mushroom, sausage, and black olive for my parents. I ordered a large stromboli with hot peppers for me, and a small cheese pizza for my kids. Delivery took 45 minutes as indicated.

The pizza was hot and fresh. The sausage and mushrooms were large and very tasty. My stromboli was very good. The peppers had just a hint of heat. I was hoping for a little more kick there. The mozzarella and ham were tasty. I grew up eating oily stromboli and this was dry by comparison. 

We haven't eaten PJ's pizza in a long time, so we were due. We liked it and we would order it again."}
{"text":"Big Money for Small Pizzas. If what I got was a large, I could only imagine that a small would be the size of a DVD. 

Pierogie Pizza: Just normal pizza crust, layer of mashed potato / onion, and a slight sprinkle of cheese. A very small \"Large\" pizza for 14 bucks. For what you get (mashed potatoes and bread)  I think this one needs to drop a few bucks.

Wing Prices are competitive, and very good. I would not hesitate to recommend the wings to a friend any day!"}
