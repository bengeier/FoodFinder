{"text":"Went here two times while I was in the area. Food was good to average depending on who you would have asked in my group, service could vary depending on your server. Sat out on the patio the first time and our server Erica was very helpful &  very friendly since we didn't speak french. the second time we went in and sat at the bar, the bartender didn't speak more than a few words of english and really didn't help us that much, couldn't even order an ice t from her & there were bar backs that could speak english that cold have helped her. On the plus side, the waitresses here are very attractive, and so are the female customers that are all around, so sit out on the patio if it's nice & enjoy the scenery even if you can't order what you want."}
{"text":"20,000 square feet of cavernous warehouse space dotted with red lights suggests this place totally devoid of character, until you see the patrons - strippers and guys with tribal sleeve tattoos and Tapout shirts that make you think you're stuck in Vegas circa 2005.   The waitstaff are friendly but the food is totally hit or miss. The sliders were dry and rubbery, but the shrimp salad was excellent. The burger seemed OK, but the ribs looked like a lump of loose stool.   Overall, not much else  to say. This place is part of a suburban strip-mall-complex designed to jam as many people in and feed their gaping maws as they watch hockey games and listen to J. Lo and Pitbull at full volume. As a dining experience, total crap. If you live in Laval and just want to relax and have a burger, it's perfectly fine."}
{"text":"Vraiment déçu!!  Après 1.5hr on à finalement reçu notre entrée, une trempette Kale et artichauts un peu petite, mais heureusement délicieuse.. un autre 20 min d'attente pour des plats tiède.. Des côtes levées (5) trop peu pour le $$ et le burger Huston .. plutôt ordinaire .. un erreur petit à la cuisine pour changer l'accompagnement.. pas très fort.. elle aurait dû nous laisser l'assiette et apporter l'accompagnement .. depuis le temps qu'on attend !! service donc pas très attentionné surtout lorsque tu sais que tes clients attendent depuis si longtemps .. les gérants auraient CERTAINEMENT pu alléger l'attente en distribuant des trucs à grignoter !! Je ne crois pas que nous y retournerons de ci-tôt dommage !!"}
{"text":"It's a cool restaurant that's sorta like a mix between a club/bar and restaurant. You'll dine like a restaurant but they have a DJ spinning throughout meals but doesn't make the place overtly noisy, can definitely still have your conversations without needing to scream at one another.  Did I mention the waitresses are HOT? Dam...  Food quality was definitely good, we had the NY Striploin and it was up there with the best of steakhouses.  It's definitely not a quiet place so if you're younger and love the club vibe than this place is definitely a great place to hangout. Crowd's mostly working professionals and with quite some beautiful people hanging around so I'd recommend you dress up a little or might feel a little out of place.  Did I mention the waitresses are really hot? :)"}
{"text":"Worse service I have ever had. I have been to several restaurants and this one beat them all. Got in on the 19th of January at 530. At 7PM Still no food. At 8pm we were done but waited for 30 minutes for bill!!!  Had to get up and walk to front reception. Got our bill and for the first time ever I left $0 of tip!!!  Bad. Verrrrrry bad. Never ever going back  Too bad since it had nice potential to bring our sales team and customers over for business meals! There are a lot of other choices near by so we are ok  DL"}
{"text":"Giving airport food the typical bad name.  Waited for 20 mins and never approached by wait staff (arrived a few mins after husband ordered).  Wait staff lingering in back staff area despite a full house & very busy.  His burger came out charred, dry, over cooked, and cold, and well undersized in relation to the bun.  Wait staff very slow, not friendly.  Fries undercooked, mealy texture.  Missing water service and utensils.  Worst food in all of Montreal. Never will return."}
{"text":"Our server was wonderful. Food was on the pricey side, but decent. I also enjoyed the fact that, without asking, I received a side of mayo for my fries.  Went with the chicken sandwich. Arugula was not the best choice of greens for the sandwich, and the mango mayo they claimed was on the sandwich was nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"Food & service 5 stars. Ambiance is More a club ambiance even in the dining room. Not enough privacy, but overall excellent!"}
{"text":"We came here after buying a gift card at Costco. The waiter was super nice and did a great job serving us except that he was kind of slow (e.g.: it took him 10 min to serve us our water). We had the calamari as an entrance and it still tasted a little bit of flour and it was kind blend. The quantity was also not generous. After that my mom and I had the cote levee au jus and my side was the all dressed baked potato and she had the house salad.  The meat was also rather blend and the texture was not that pleasant. I asked for rare but it tasted more like medium rare and the baked potato tasted like complete shit. My mom salad did not look or tasted fresh and it was for some reason extremely oily. We wont be coming back but it is kind of a shame that the taste doesnt match with the excellent service."}
{"text":"Giving it two stars for our server, who was super efficient, and for their creative menu. But for the price I paid, I could have experienced better. I started out with the calamari. They were okay - kind of bland and too greasy for my taste, but they were calamari and I firmly believe there is no such thing as bad calamari.   As my main dish, I had the Bison Burger with a side of sweet potato fries. I was really, irrationally excited for this burger. It sounded so deliciously amazing on the menu, but when I got it, I was underwhelmed. Maybe I built it up too much in my mind? Either way, I found it to be super tasteless, bland. It was almost like the meat overpowered all the other flavours - but seeing as the meat lacked flavour too, you were kind of just chewing textures.  At the end of the night, my bill came out to almost $40 and I was left full, but unsatisfied. I've had much better for much cheaper, and for what I paid I expected better."}
{"text":"The waiter was slow and we waited almost 30 minutes to order our food. I had the onion soup as an entrée, it was good but there was barely any broth in it, mostly cheese. I had the steak with fries for the main meal, the steak had no taste to it. The prices on the menu were also really expensive. Definitely not going back here"}
{"text":"Go if you want to pay 25$ for literally 5 tasteless and dry ribs. Will never go back ! Go spend your hard-earned money else where!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh... le Houston à Laval. Lorsque l'hiver s'en retourne, que les jupes raccourcissent, que les tattoos et lunettes soleil apparaissent, que les tuques deviennent un accessoire modes et non un réchauffe tête, l'intêret pour le Houston reprends.   On s'entends, on n'y va pas seulement pour la nourriture mais bien plus pour la terrasse et les 5-7 du jeudi avec des copains de bureau.  Oui, le menu est pratiquement un copier coller des Firegrill, Zibo, Maddison de ce monde mais bon, c'est correcte. Il est toujours amusant de voir les amis de bureaux, s'extasier devant les jolies serveuses ou les gentils barman. (ok ok, il m'arrive quelque fois de le faire en secret). Le pichets de sangria à défaut d'être bon sont de bonne taille et le service et toujours sympathique.  A aller quand il fait chaud!"}
{"text":"Went on Valentines day!! Got a tulip right away as we entered. Im pregnant so cant eat any red meat. The waitress was so helpful and friendly really made our night extra special with my picky eating habits. Long story short they made us happy. Much absolutely get the brownie dessert. It comes with this caramel ice cream and fried bananas with whip cream and pieces of maple crunch on top. Delicious!!! Great portion of salsa and sour cream for nachos very generous! Husband enjoyed his rib steak and baked potato."}
{"text":"Nourriture moyenne. Les côtes levées sont bien meilleurs dans d'autres restaurants du genre (Baton Rouge). Le menu est dispendieux pour ce qu'ils servent."}
{"text":"First I thought this was Houston's, the prime steak house I've been to in other cities.  No worries though, they had steak which is what I was looking for.  Servers were very nice and as mentioned in another post, very pretty.  Ambiance was nice, has a contemporary, open feel.  Service was good, it was a Monday night with a few holiday revelers in the bar area.  I got the steak which was good and served medium just as I requested.    Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"If anyone has been to Earls out west or Moxies then this is definitely a \"Quebec version\".  Mostly all young attractive women wearing some kind of \"business sexy\" black outfits in heels and mostly men 40's + crowd as patrons.  It was business lunch so I ordered a Thai Chicken salad which was very nice!  The person I was with ordered a Red tuna salad.  His came out with a nice huge piece of Tuna.  The catch was his salad was $24 and mine was $18.  Bill was a healthy $60 as my friend ordered a few beers.  Food was okay- good but pricey especially for lunch!"}
{"text":"Efficient service, but would expect much better quality for the price paid - food was rather bland. I wouldn't recommend the calamari, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Glad we had a gift card!"}
{"text":"Decor is very nice and appropriate for a steakhouse -- but the 37\" plasmas all around are more Cage Aux Sports territory. A big, thorough cleanup is needed as you can pickup dust on the cubicle sidings easily, and fingermarks are all over. Service is great and very friendly. I would prefer seeing a hostess a little bit more appropriate (ours was 16 and was never told to \"stand up straight\"... Typical youth), could change the overall impression we get of the place. Food was excellent-- I chose ribs (half rack) and though the cooking was awesome, they were a little bit too fruity for my taste. Would be an excellent idea to have a choice of sauces. Fries were awesome. A bit on the pricey side, but compared to a lot of places, Houston's is on the right track. 3-1/2*."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable. We had oysters as our appetizers. They were reasonably priced for a dozen. The oysters would taste better without the specs of salmon tartar on top but that's just my personal preference. The main steak dishes were slightly disappointing. We took a chance to order the prime rib steak at 9pm.  The meat wasn't as tender , in fact it on the tougher side, but our server quickly provided us another suggestion and replaced it with a rib steak which was better.  I had the sirloin with seafood topper.  The steak was good but needed more seasoning. Was not  a fan of the seafood topper which has lobster bisque flavour with small scallops and tiny shrimps.  I did not enjoy the potato gratin, there was too much cheese . Overall the ambiance was nice. I would probably come again for the traditional steak dishes. Our bill with two cocktails, two glasses of wine, oysters and two main steak dishes cost us about $170."}
{"text":"Typical American style steakhouse comparable to a slightly nicer Outback Steakhouse. Food took quite a while to come out but the drinks were quick. The ambiance is some mix between nightclub and restaurant. Food portions were adequate but somewhat repetitive as the same aspects appear in many dishes."}
{"text":"First time here and it was a nice experience.    Where to start?   Well, first off, the servers all look like French models.  Wow. Very beautiful.  And they wear revealing dresses which look classy.    The meal was good (salad with seared tuna) and the atmosphere was perfect.  We ate outside and the weather was a perfect 75F.    I want to come back for the steaks and appetizers as they looked great but I had too much for lunch so I opted for one of the 8 or so salads.     Prices are mid range which are just above the popular chains but less than a specialty chop House by far, but the quality doesn't look to be much less.  I am here all week so hopefully I'll be back soon.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went there for a family supper. The waiters were really nice and efficient, and answered all our questions about the menu. For starters, I ordered nachos and spicy fried chicken. They were both good, but the nachos were a bit burnt and the spicy chicken was really similar to general tao, but it wasn't bad. For my main course, I had a rib steak with a side of potato puree. The steak and the sauce given with it (pepper sauce) were too salty. Usually, when I order a rib steak, I expect to really enjoy the steak, but this time, I was underwhelmed.  I also tried a drink, the peach sangria. Tasted more like water with some artificial peach flavour."}
