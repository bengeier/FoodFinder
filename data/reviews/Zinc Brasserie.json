{"text":"I stopped at Zinc because it appeared to be the higher end restaurant in the Southwest section of the airport. I ordered the Zinc Burger and a Mountain Dew. I took one star away because the waitress brought a coke out at first. The second because I asked for medium rare, but the burger was clearly medium (no pink whatsoever). The third because the fries were very oily and overcooked. I'd give it another shot if I have another long layover at Phoenix."}
{"text":"Bottom line is that it's still airport food. I had a chicken baguette and the bread came out tough and chewy as well as my pieces of weird looking chicken. The place has potential and I would probably enjoy a few drinks here but I don't think I could come back strictly for the food."}
{"text":"I overlooked this place several times due to the yelp reviews. So glad I made it here on my long layover. The food is good and healthy, the staff are accommodating and worthy of a true restaurant, the wine selection is right up my alley, and I don't feel like I'm at an airport! Yes, the food is on the pricier side, but that's true for all airport food."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see Zinc at the airport!  They had the omelette available and I love it at Zinc Bistro so that's what I ordered. Big mistake. After the first bite I realized it tasted seriously off.  Tried the crispy potato and it tasted old and just bad. Talked to the waitress. She came back, apologized, said she spoke with the manager and there wouldn't be a charge. He was cleaning tables all around me but never stopped by my table!  Really!  He's leaving it up to the waitress?!  It would've taken just a moment of his time to let me know that I, as a customer, mattered. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Decent food. Terrible staff the hostess literally didn't speak or greet us and the waiter Ty just couldn't be bothered to actually be a decent human being. Took the order and then basically disappeared until time for the check.  No thank you for coming. No have a nice day. Get a different job."}
{"text":"Was surprised to see so many bad reviews because my pork belly baguette with fig and apple was warm and delightful. Pretty good for airport food. Then again, mine was fresh from the kitchen because I dined in. Maybe the grab 'n' go should be avoided?"}
{"text":"Fast ( for busy location) and reasonably priced ... Patron and omelet not my usual combination but it's good anyway"}
{"text":"Zinc house salad: $13 not including tax and tip for a bag of lettuce with flavorless dressing. The one crunchy piece of bread with tiny schmear of goat cheese was good. Service was busy but good. All in all I say go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wow 32.00, my problem wasn't the food, anyone can cook a piece of hamburger.  My problem is seating area, community table.   You should ask if people are eating or drinking.   You put me on a table with a bunch of Danone employees, so close one of them was on my lap.  Loud and must have been there first trip anywhere, was so uncomfortable for me, I had two bits and I was out of their.  Remember if you're interested in eating here make sure you tell the host or hostess not that table."}
{"text":"I was at Sky Harbor for a layover so I decided to stop and get something to eat due to my flight being delayed. I stopped at Zinc. I was greeted by a hostess and sat at a table with a view of Phoenix. I was told I was looking at Camelback Mnt in the distance. I ordered a nice glass of wine and the Pork Belly appetizer that was recommended by my server.  It was wonderful!!! The restaurant was clean and friendly. I was there in the late morning/early afternoon. I have read a few of the other reviews from other customers before I decided to post this. I understand that this is a new location at the airport, however, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food and service that I received. I hope to have a reason to return to Phoenix to enjoy another meal or snack there. I guess it may be luck of the draw as far as the time of day you visit. As for me, I was very happy with my choice to stop there!!! Hope others have as good of an experience as I did. Good Job Zinc!!"}
{"text":"If you have enough time to sit down at a full service restaurant while on your layover in Phoenix and aren't looking for a cheap and quick place, stop in to Zinc Brasserie. The menu is a bit pricey, but hey you're in an airport, but you will find really yummy French food. I recommend the Ham and Gruyere Cheese sandwich on a baguette. Perfectly toasted and warm + the mustard on it... oh my! Yes so tasty. Makes traveling all the more comfortable. Am I going to France? No. But a nice mini break from traveling was lovely! And whatever sauce they serve with the fries- YES!"}
{"text":"It is not the cheapest place, $16.00 for onion soup and $10.00 for fries but the food was good.  Not as loud as some of the other restaurants.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Awesome!  2 hour layover  in Phoenix.  Just wanted to sit down and eat something.  This place was amazing, great service great food, forgot we were in an airport. Made  the layover enjoyable."}
{"text":"$$$$$ most over priced restaurant I have been too. $14 cup of soup should have been $5 or $6 .  Sandwich was $16 should have been $6 or $7. Soup was French Onion one of my favorites but this soup tasted of wine or sherry that had not been cooked enough. Save your money. Eat at the taco place across the aisle."}
{"text":"Had the pork belly sandwich here and it was awesome!! Best sandwich I've had in a long time and by far the best airport food I've ever had. Would give it five stars but the fries were under salted and the seasoning they use isn't that great."}
{"text":"Walking the entire airport looking for good food my last hope was this one, and let me tell you that there is no other option like Zinc inside the airport. Food exceeds my expectations. Service was very good as well. Would love to eat again next time being there."}
{"text":"I had a 2 hour layover and wanted a sit down place for breakfast. Sat down at 9:50 and was told breakfast ended at 10, so the only eggs available were a French omelet. Four eggs supposedly and billed as coming with shoestring fries. It was 3 eggs at most, more likely 2 eggs with a couple of tablespoons of brown shoestrings that were garnish. Nothing else. Cost? $14 plus $3 for coffee. I know an airport meal is generally way overpriced, but this was out of line even for an airport.

Walk a bit and go to Barrio in the D gates."}
{"text":"The shave chicken salad for $15.50 bought on June 14 at 6:30 PM, three hours later I was violently ill on a plane, not fun, so be careful on your order. I'm sure their food is usually good and I tried to call to warn them.  However, they do not have a phone number listed and I tried many ways with no success."}
{"text":"Overpriced, lousy food. Two entrees along with one kids meal added up to more than $70.....no appetizers, no alcohol and no deserts. The food was only passable. Save yourself a bunch of money and grab a meal somewhere else....McDonalds would be an improvement."}
{"text":"My husband's only criteria for airport food is eating something that won't make his stomach hurt. That goes to show you how horribly bad airport food generally is. Zinc has totally bucked this trend. It's like a real restaurant, guys. The food is excellent. The fries are crazy delicious and my burger came out perfectly. They have an extensive beer and wine selection as well, which is such a nice change from the typical house wine and nasty water beer typically found at airport restaurants. I'm just passing through Phoenix, so I doubt I will be able to enjoy Zinc again, but locals flying out should definitely hit it up.

Oh and bonus! Outlets for charging electronics are at all the tables!"}
{"text":"If you are familiar with the original in Scottsdale, don't bother.  Menu is similar, but that is where the similarity ends.  Corporate ownership has messed with a beautiful thing. Stopped here while delayed, and having been to the original Zinc Bistro dozens of times since it's opening decades ago, I was excited by the chance to experience the airport version. Uh, nope. Service was eh, with no real recognition of being in an airport (i.e., there might be time constraints).  Ordered the omelet, which was overcooked and puddled in a fair amount of \"lube\" from the grill...took me back to my Village Inn days!!  The real topper - I asked for bread (remembering the as-close-to-Paris-as-you-get-in-Phoenix version at the Bistro) and got the following: \"we don't have bread, but I can bring you some for $3\" - what?? Curiosity piqued, I received some \"grilled\" slices of \"baguette\" that the kitchen miraculously found, served with two foil packages of butter.

I get this is the airport, but if you're gonna use the name, at least get a little close - Barrio, Matt's and L'Orangerie don't seem to be having the same problem. I hope the payout for the corporate ownership was worth it, Matt and Terry!"}
{"text":"Horrible sexism experienced in Zinc this evening when manager on duty refused to play women's FIFA and instead changed bar televisions to basketball regardless of several customer requests. He called me \"little lady\" and \"girl\" several times. I'm 40.

Women are the main consumers of wine in America. Not in Phoenix. 
Phoenix: the friendliest airport. Not for women."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly. I ordered the Zinc Croissant, add avocado and bacon, it was delish! A bit pricey but tasty and a bit fancy."}
{"text":"I ordered the oatmeal, which looked good and the first bite was good... Then found a hair in it. Honestly wasn't super upset- I told the waitress and she took it back and I said I didn't want anything to replace it. My boyfriend got his burger after that. From that point on she never checked on us and I watched her purposely walk around the other way to avoid our table. I've been a server and have had this happen to my table- I know its awkward but if they have hair in their food you should do your best to turn around their experience, not avoid them. The hair thing happens. Customer service determines how things go from there. Took forever to get our check. Next time we'll make the walk to four peaks."}
{"text":"I must have caught this place on a bad day.  The shaved chicken salad was remarkably bland, the service consistently slow, and the prices way too high for what you get. (i.e., $22 for a salad and a beer, and I left the place almost as hungry as I arrived).  Service:  waiter was slow to arrive initially, then I had a 5 minute wait for a beer.  When the food came, it was wrong.  They quickly fixed it, and it was at that point I realized there was almost zero taste.  I went for the salt and pepper, and, of course, they are too pretentious to actually have that on the table, so I have to ask the waiter for it.  Five minutes and another \"I'm sorry\" later, I have salt and pepper.  I then witness the bartender spend 7 or 8 minutes trying to figure out which checks were open and which were closed so he could go home (it was 7:20) - all the while ignoring the two women who sat down.  Admittedly, he did look up once and say \"I know you're here, I'll be right with you\".  Seriously, make sure you cash out before pouring that drink - nobody at an airport bar is in any kind of hurry or anything.

Anyhow, I'd never go back based on my experience. Maybe they had an off night, but..."}
{"text":"Most expensive croissant i've ever had. Ended up paying close to $20 for a tiny sandwich. The single slice of tomato was $2. Crazy"}
{"text":"Great fries. Tiny \"portion\". 
Quick service. 
Above average prices. 
Muzak is also above average."}
{"text":"I just witnessed a very unprofessional manager loudly berating his employees right in front of customers.  I was embarrassed for them....it was very uncomfortable!! He was definitely someone that should not be s manager.  He was very negative and threatening them with write ups for not selling enough bottled water.  The staff is amazing and a very upbeat nice restaurant.  But this manager has got some kind of power trip going and needs to be educated in professional management of his staff."}
{"text":"Cold beer and amazing green beans - shiitake mushrooms
And the full French name to boot!  Good people watching when you are spending some time in PHX!"}
{"text":"Good food for an airport restaurant! I usually find it really hard to get decent food at an airport restaurant. And the service is usually lacking as well. This place had neither issue. The food, french onion soup and the ham sandwich, were both great! The service was extremely attentive. I was really surprised by this place. I will be visiting again on my next trip."}
{"text":"Do not make the mistake of leaving the main terminal and being subject to this place as the only option to dine. If you do; go back!!! First off a $17 martini. No real gripe there. But the $20 steak salad pictured here was abysmal.  Clearly made by morning staff and sitting in a cooler all day.  Wilted iceberg lettuce, a few bleu cheese crumbles and thinly sliced tasteless steak.  Oh yes, some green beans sliced to imperfection. The only saving grace; wish my name were Grace, was the overly friendly liquor pushing bartenders which makes sense as an overcompensation for the flaccid and forgettable food. As a biologist, I know that Zinc prevents the corrosion of iron but in this case, given its namesake, it also contributes to the erosion of good food. God bless the staff; and tip them well."}
{"text":"What a great experience! My flight on Southwest was delayed so I searched for some liquid courage and found Zinc. Was able to get a seat at the bar had a FABULOUS waiter. I don't remember his name but he was tall and talking about triathlons. 
I ordered a Rose and a pork belly sandwich - absolute heaven in an airport. I can't wait to fly again and hope to be delayed! (Not really.)"}
{"text":"Amazing Food and Amazing Service. Thanks Zinc for coming to Sky Harbor Terminal 4. My server Nicole and Manager Jeff truly know the meaning of \"Genuine Customer Service\", Thanks guys. I will be back.."}
{"text":"The food was good and came fast. I had the Zinc croissant. Too bad I didn't get my coffee in a timely fashion. First, the espresso machine was broken, so no cappuccino. So I ordered a coffee. The waitress didn't bring it until I asked a second time, so it was a good ten minutes after I ordered that I got my coffee. Not that they were very busy.  She was just not very attentive."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here today. Cheese plate appetizer and Flat Iron Steak Salad. Very nice food. Great service."}
{"text":"Awesome Gem in the aiport. Food is to die for. Was in PHX for a 2.5 hr layoever on my way to SF and decided to stop by this place. I got the best pork belly ever and my neighbor's palte of cheese looked equally delicious. My jaw was about to drop. Music and ambiance is awesome and above all staff is really genuinely friendly and efficient. My waitress Jessica was not too invasive and made me feel at ease after a hard day of traveling and gave a sincere (I hope) compliment on my watch! Small things that make a big difference and that customers do appreciate. I also got convinced into trying their chocolate bread which was to die for ... Other restaurants in this country should really follow this model!"}
{"text":"Very expensive and painfully slow service. We stopped in here while waiting for our flight this past Friday. It was towards the end of the night and you could tell everyone was more interested in getting out of here than serving customers.  We waited a solid seven minutes from my wife's glass of champagne, followed up by another five minute wait for me to get my drink. This is inexcusable at an airport bar.  We have no intentions of ever returning here."}
{"text":"Save your time and money. Very overpriced for such small portions. My wife ordered a breakfast sandwich and was still hungry afterwards so we stopped at Paradise Bakery, also because I had ordered oatmeal and they were out of it. My wife liked her sandwich, it was just small and overpriced. Service was extremely slow, even though it was not very busy."}
{"text":"Nothing beats Zinc Bistro when in Scottsdale EXCEPT Zinc Bistro when you're at Sky Harbor with 2 hours to kill before your flight! I had the pate plate with two big slabs of pate, 4 halves of bread, an interesting mustard/egg mix and the biggest caper series I've ever seen. Add a delicious glass of Côte de Rhone and I won't mind if my flight is delayed!"}
{"text":"Wow, I was shocked to find this gem in an airport! I would actually choose to use Phoenix as a hub because of this restaurant...it's pretty authentic in its attempt to be a Parisien bistro. That's hard to find anywhere outside of NYC let alone an airport! We had the burger with arugula and truffle cheese and it was perfectly cooked and juicy. Our server was lovely and attentive. Fantastic experience making our transit through PHX so pleasant!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Waitress has an attitude. Didn't bring ketchup, as I requested with my order. Didn't bring butter or jelly for croissant until I asked for it, it was brought dry.  No coffee refills offered until after I was done eating.  Wouldn't suggest and won't return.  I will stick with pretzels"}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious food especially
For an airport! My only complaint is it's expensive.... 17 for a delicious warm chicken sandwich and fries. But honestly I'd come here and pay for it again. So yummy! Staff is on top of it and super nice! Manager is taking care of orders that get taken out, nice place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pork belly appetizer before my flight this afternoon. Super rich with fig/mustard butter. 

I will order next time I'm at PHX. 

F"}
{"text":"Good for the airport. Fun and attentive staff. Steak salad w lots of Roquefort was great. Wish I opted for the smaller wine pour. Took a little long. Friend liked his omelet mucho."}
{"text":"Not very friendly on your wallet. Save you $$ and skip the burger. As a burger aficionado, I was disappointed by the burger. Medium is medium and not well done. The meat had very little flavor which is why I assume the mix garlic in with the meat. Still not impressed."}
{"text":"Been to the airport location of Zinc Brasserie twice.  First time was a couple weeks ago.  Sat at the bar.  Served quickly by the young lady bartender.  She was good, witty, very personable.  I only had time for a drink and I had the proseco.  it was good, light, fruity. Just what I wanted at the time.  The espresso martini looked good.  WIll have to try next time. 
Second time was this afternoon, skipped lunch so i can try their warm dungeness crab crepe, which did not disappoint.  Very pretty, very tasty.  light by hearty. the peppercorns added some heat.  Lots of crab, mushrooms.  good portion for 1.  Will have again.  And now the service...got seated quickly, like the first time, by the requested electric outlet.  however the service by the booth was slooow.  There were a couple young servers who didn't seem to know what they're doing or what they're supposed to do.  just milling around.  had to flag one down for a drink as he served the person next to me.  Thank goodness a more experienced (i.e. older) server arrived and took charge.  after that, she was attentive and got my crepe out quickly.
quick tip, sit by the bar, order the crab and any drink.  they're all good.
update: server Michelle was great.  almost upsold me to get the beignets and the pudding.  Heart set on pudding which was very good.  have to love French food.  it's rich.

ambience is like an upscale bistro.  Tin ceilings and flat screens by the bar."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best airport restaurants we've ever found. Love the food, the wine and the bartenders."}
{"text":"If your in a hurry stay away...
Zinc burger ordered Medium well, came out Medium rare...flat iron salad decent...service horrible..."}
{"text":"$36 for an 8 oz glass of wine and a ham sandwich. Seriously.

Even for airport food, that's really pricey. I buy bottles of wine for less than I paid for the glass. The ham and gruyere sandwich was good, liked the touch of cranberries. The fries were dusted with paprika, but not as hot as I would have liked. And the wine was delicious. I really didn't have to wait 15 minutes to be seated. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The place was definitely airport loud and airport busy. I just think it's incredibly overpriced."}
{"text":"Drinks were good, and so was the ham and briguere baguette sandwich, but way overpriced (on layover at Phx Int'l Airport).  Service was great, and our server was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Not sure what this restaurant thinks it is but not fine dining at all. Inspect to pay more for food and drinks in an airport, but this is airport prices inside an airport.  Paid $17 for a double jack and Coke and was pretty watered down.  Go down past C13 for better dining.  This place charges twice what you'd expect."}
{"text":"Pricy but what you can expect for an airport, right? Food was good. Shared a chicken pesto sandwich on fresh baguette which came with fries lightly dusted in smoked paprika & salt around $18. Side of a nice spicy mayo & an interesting \"ketchup\" salsa. Decent pinot $11 for a 5oz. Service was quick, and our server (whatever his name was) was attentive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service, stupid expensive. When you name French Fries...'Frites', you can charge ten dollars. They are accompanied by fancy ketchup and mustard."}
{"text":"Worst service ever - the host is suffering from little man syndrome and ruling the line without any justice. The food was moderate at best; drinks overpriced but mixed well; the whole event was marred by the host and the situations he was creating with waiting guests"}
{"text":"Ordered the grilled chicken salad and there was hardly any chicken, but lots of romaine salad. Expensive..."}
{"text":"Exceptional dining option for an airport.  Lunch was excellent, and it was hard to believe I was eating in an airport, and not a stand alone restaurant."}
{"text":"This place gets three stars for service! Terry was great and checked on me often :) some of the other employees were  dressed very unprofessionally... I work in restaurants so maybe I'm being too harsh but it was a strange experience.  I ordered the short rib baguette... Wish it had a delicious sauce or something !! Lacking flavor.  The fries were pretty good !"}
{"text":"I usually fly into PHX for a layover pretty frequently. I have never stopped into this joint before, but I was feeling an appetizer and beer. Selection was a little better than average for an airport. The service was good, not above average. The bartender told me to go with the mac and cheese, in which i did because he said it was the best option. He was wrong. The uncured ham in the mac and cheese was phenomenal, but that was definitely the only highlight of that dish. I was not pleased with it and due to that i will not be eating here again. As for drinks if the other alcohol serving establishments are busy then I will definitely give this a try again. I don't like to be to harsh from one experience, unless the overall experience was awful."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink before my long business flight to Cleveland. Did not eat breakfast but just had drinks.  Yes I said it breakfast. So yes it was early haha but drinks were needed.  

The ambiance is pretty great. Middle bar with plenty seating around. Friendly staff. And the food that was coming out looked pretty good. However, the gentleman next to me ordered one thing and got another.  He didn't care, still ate it but he got the wrong thing. The waitresses response was oh he's not awake yet haha. 

Anyways on to my flight now. Overall I would come back to check out what breakfast I would get when ordered."}
{"text":"Omg - probably the worst airport sandwich I have had in the last 20 years.  They call it a \"baguette\" but don't be fooled...it is about as far as you can imagine from a baguette.  More like a leaden hamburger bun with overheated meats and mash of other shit in there, greasy, hot, gross.  

Do yourself a favor and get a burrito elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I had 1 1/2 hours before our Southwest flight. Lots of time for a relaxing nice French experience. And although the food was excellent, the service was awful. We ordered a wine and a cheese plate to start and a gourmet burger to split. It took 15 minutes to be greeted and have our order taken... And it wasn't busy. The cheese plate came with no crackers and a small serving of bread.... So we asked for more bread-- FOUR TIMES! A 2nd server came finally and said the bread would be right up... But it never appeared! The burger finally came but there was no mustard, mayo or salt/pepper and we COULDN'T GET CONDIMENTS. Now it was time to get in line for our boarding priority AND NO SERVER TO PAY. Of course there were servers standing around everywhere but not ours. We needed the check! Now! So I finally found the manager, asked for a credit for the uneaten cheese plate (he refused but gave us the stale bread that had been sitting there waiting to be served), we paid, no tip and ran to the gate. AVOID!!!"}
{"text":"The place is nice and let's face it, we're in the airport so anything beyond grab and go is certainly welcome.  So my flight was delayed and wanted an old fashioned and was recommended the rye direction which for a knockoff of an old fashion is pretty damn good.  The food is a bit on the pricey side though.. Fries are like 7 bucks and I went for the flat iron steak which was cooked good but lacked in flavor.  As I'm writing this the waiter comes over to notify that I gave him too much money for a tip... So originally this place got 3 stars but now it gained another two for the waiter being honest.  Food is good but pricey, drinks are good but hell I'd pay 20 for a good drink."}
{"text":"Le petite you might say? A buttery croissant with a egg over hard and gruyere cheese was delicious but a little over priced for $10 for something I could easily make myself. Additional $2 for tomato, avocado or bacon. Their other menu items also looked yummy but just had a stomach for some breakfast food. Overall decent for the stomach."}
{"text":"I ordered a bloody mary and a ham and gruyere bagette. However my sandwich arrived on a panini rather than the baguette. Not cool since the sandwich itself is entitled 'Ham and Gruyere Bagette'.  Husband ordered a zinc burger. Each were served with cold pom frites. The ketchup had tomato pieces in it. All in all it was tasty except for the cold frites. Expensive food and drinks: cocktails were $13 each, burger was $17.50 and my so called baguette andwich was $15. I realize this restaurant is inside an airport but too costly for a fast lunch."}
{"text":"Zinc is the BEST airport food I have ever had! We had a Southwest layover during late dinner hours and found Zinc a perfect place to relax and grab a delicious bite. We LOVED the red wine braised pork belly starter, the grilled chicken paillard, and mac and cheese. I'm honestly bummed that this isn't a chain restaurant that I can find in Cali!"}
{"text":"Review is for breakfast. Zinc is one of the fancier places to grab a bite in an airport: shiny wood furniture, decorations adorning the walls, and yes, the cuisine happens to be French too!

The food is okay, but very expensive relative to the portion size.  I tried to order the savory crepe but they ran out.  Mon Dieu!  That's like a bar running out of beer!  I got instead the breakfast croissant with bacon - decent, a bit petit, but definitely not worth the price.

My wife ordered the French Omelet - nice, fluffy omelet filed with ham and gruyere and topped with fried potato straws.  This dish was actually pretty good.  I've been watching you-tube videos of how Jacques Pepin makes French Omelets and the form and texture looks very similar to Zinc's."}
{"text":"The food is good but the portions are tiny. it's over priced like all restaurants in an airport. Staff is good. it's also clean. skip this place and walk a little further down."}
{"text":"Good food and poor attitude. 

So, we ordered a steak salad, a chicken salad and 1 iced tea. The bill was 40 bucks.  I'm not surprised at the extreme cost since it's at the airport, but for that kind of money you would not expect the waiter to be lame. 

This dude was was grouchy, never smiled and was not friendly at all.  In fact, when he swiped my credit card and he forced me to put a tip into his machine (which I gave him a nice one), he handed me my receipt and walked away. He didn't say thank you, he didn't say have a great day, he didn't say a damn word.  Myself and my buddy who is a pilot, and was dressed as such, looked at each other in a strange way.

If you get back to me I have his name and I'm happy to supply it to management. It's waiters like this which cause patrons like me not to want to tip and the waitstaff suffers.

Good luck with your business. I'm going to Burger King next time."}
{"text":"I just now picked up a salad here. Pick up & go right at beginning of A gates Actually 4 stars for good salad selection. More than just the usual Caesar & Cobb, snacks include protein bars & sugary items, drinks & more I'm sure, I just looked for what I wanted. 

One star for surly 20 something at the counter. Seriously, grow up. You have a job which requires being somewhat friendly & nice. If you hate it that much, quit. Didn't even bag my stuff. Just put bag on counter when I had to ask for one. Wouldn't be a person I would hire for customer service. Would be a person I would fire tho."}
{"text":"There was a dog at the bar, nothing was done. Even if it was a real service dog (it wasn't) it should not be up near and on surfaces where people eat. See photo for the pug service dog. The staff did nothing and allowed this nonsense to continue. Really, how sanitary could the place be with this complacency."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero.  Other than bartender Todd who was professional and friendly, terrible management.  $20 for a bowl of soup with probably 7-8 small mussels.  Upon comment that they were \"light\" not even a visit from manager and told both kitchen manager and manager said simply company policy.  No offer of anything.  Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Onion soup is great, but the smallest serving I've ever seen and the most I've ever paid.  Bar service was really inattentive. Had to ask for a spoon, sugar for my Luke warm cappuccino, and for a refill on my club soda.  Waitress was Mediocre at best.  
So, great food, high price, average service.  One data point."}
{"text":"The Grilled Chicken Paillard is the best meal I have ever had in an airport, and well worth the $18 price tag.  Zinc makes connecting through Phoenix a treat!"}
{"text":"My meal was oustanding, extremely quick, and the service was great. I had only 30 minutes to eat and get to my gate and the staff made sure I wasn't late."}
{"text":"I think Zinc Brasserie will get better and better. I visited the restaurant only 6 days after they opened. 

The good:  The food is amazing.  I had a sandwich and dessert.  I can't remember what the sandwich was called but it was a pork sandwich. It was cooked to perfection.  Dessert was great too!  (Creme brûlée). 

The atmosphere is lovely!  Much more comfortable and elegant than other airport restaurants.  

The bad:  I noticed some issues with cleanliness (staff practices, dirty dish ware, dirty tables).  The staff also was somewhat unfriendly and borderline rude.   


Love love love Matt Carter concepts. The Mission, Zinc and House Brasserie are among some of my favorite restaurants.  I can't wait o try this location again and see how staff (and cleanliness) is settling in and improving."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a quick breakfast during our recent layover at the Phoenix Airport.  We've both eaten in lots of airports and expect a slight jack-up in prices over regular, on-street restaurants.  However, the prices in this restaurant are exorbitant--AND, the serving sizes are quite diminutive!  My husband ordered an omelet with shoe-string potatoes.  When the meal arrived, my husband looked at his plate and said to the waiter, \"I ordered potatoes with the omelet.\"  The waiter said (with what must be his poker-face), \"There they are, sir.\"  What was \"there\" was a slight sweep of whitish-looking strings set over the omelet--a paltry garnish topping an omelet which looked like something ordered from a kids' menu.  I had ordered a bowl of oatmeal with fruit.  The oatmeal was tasty; however, the fruit was -- again --  more like a garnish (a few slices of fruit set on top of the oatmeal) rather than a side-dish.  The only positives in the restaurant were the waiter's friendly attitude and the good coffee.  Thus, I would advise eating elsewhere while at the Phoenix Airport."}
{"text":"Prices off the charts high.  If this was an on the street restaurant it wouldn't make it a few months.  I had an onion soup and a few beers.  The onion soup was $15.50.  Really!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went based on favorable reviews in comparison for other dining options.  Don't be fooled, this isn't high end airport dining.  The quality of the food is very poor and insulting when you factor in the prices.  I've had Trader joe's $4 salads that were better than the $16 salad I ordered.  The salad was soggy and watery, you know how no amount of dressing or toppings can save a salad that was improperly rinsed and dried?  a simple cocktail will run you $16-18. 

Service was good, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Stopped for a nosh while waiting for a plane out of PHX. Located at the beginning of the SW gates. A nice oasis in the airport. Has an upscale bar feel. Decent beer on draft. Nice food choices on the menu. Yeah, it's industrial, but a decent job never-the-less. A nice place in the airport to get away from the airport."}
{"text":"Had a massive layover in phx trying to get back to Oakland... The southwest terminals are under construction and the C gate area specifically had nothing but a news shop and a no name pop-up bar in front of \"coming soon!\" barriers. So since I had about 2 plus hours to kill I walked down to the B gate area and stumbled upon Zinc Brasserie- nice big inviting bar & sit down restaurant plus a to go platform adjoined. The minute I sat down I was greeted & served. The $16 steak salad I ordered was excellent- fresh, filling and great! Assembled and cooked to perfection. The food at the restaurant takes a little bit to prepare so if one is in a rush, being in an airport, it will be disappointing if you are trying to rush, eat, leave. However the staff is very vocal about the timing- ie this is going to take about 20 minutes etc. This locale is raising the bar high for airport food & prep. Many are set up for super quick turnaround and fast casual dining experience- this means most plates are pre-prepped to be nuked, or quickly assembled from frozen ingredients to be served up super quick. If you have the time it's great! I'm actually looking forward to going back the next time I have to fly out of there..."}
{"text":"I ordered to go but found out right after I paid that my flight was delayed. So I told them I wanted to sit down instead. They had to consult a few people if that was okay. Then they directed me to the bar. I asked if they didn't have a table bec I see a few of them available. They said oh we didn't want the kitchen to get mixed up. Really???? You call this service??"}
{"text":"What is up with everything closing so early at this airport? Food service ended by 7:30pm. Last call was at 8pm. Bartender was irritated with al who arrived after 7:45pm. Not friendly at all. Apparently, it was quite irritating that I ordered a water and a coke to go with my wine. He was not pleased indeed. Wish I had gotten to try the food. Menu looked promising for an airport location."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service could be better. Bartender did not offer water nor did she bring utensils when my food arrived... I probably had better luck at subway."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre. Food is poor. Steak salad is all ice burg lettuce and a few strips of steak. Lots of money, cheap food."}
{"text":"I was on my way to catch a Southwest flight out of Term 4 gate C-18 and noticed this place. I was seated at the bar, and my order was taken and the food in another 10 min. I ordered a shaved grilled chicken with \"gem lettece\". It was iceberg lettuce with chicken, some shaved cheese for $16.50 + $3 for a quarter of an avacado.  It was iceberg lettuce which costs $2 a head. While the salad was delicious, I found it a bit overpriced for a salad with iceberg lettuce. I also had a cup of coffee for $3.29 which was weak and lacked flavor. Lunch was $29 including tip. No booze was ordered."}
{"text":"There aren't many airports where you can find a nice salad (mixed greens - not iceberg or romaine) AND a decent glass of wine. I mean they have Sancerre for heavens sake. I'm healthy but a girl likes a nice glass of wine sometimes too. I thought this place was an airport winner."}
{"text":"Not to our average airport food. Very creative and fresh fare.
Pork belly sandwich is outstanding!"}
{"text":"2 hour layover. Guess I'll findsomething to eat!
I was going to try Humble Pie, but ended up here instead. 
Frites, fries... Whatever, they were just okay. I broke the cardinal rule by eating them last. They got cold and squishy quick! Not much crunch, but loved the aoili dipping sauce.
The pork belly sandwich was okay. The fig jam paired with green apple, little pieces of arugula gave it a nice sweet savory balance. I was a little indifferent about the bread. On one hand it was stable and didn't get soggy with all the sauce and junk..... Then it got to a point where it was just too much to handle. I started taking the contents out of my sandwich and ate it piece by piece. 
My waitress was great and even made a comment 'bout the picture of my husband and I on my debit card. Kudos for that ;) 
Otherwise.... I thought the food was mediocre for the price."}
{"text":"I have been here about a half dozen times in the past year. You will forget you are in the airport - the food is consistently very good. Favorites include the chicken paillard, Mac and cheese and the burger. Service has always been friendly and reasonably speedy. Only down side is drink prices - that will remind you you are in an airport!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: it's in an airport so it's not the best ambiance but it's fine for where it is. 

Service: our server was attentive and knowledgeable. 

Food: my mom had the ham and cheese sandwich she said it was very good and the ham was very good quality ham. I had the mac n cheese no ham and it was really good but a lot of mac n cheese with nothing else so I ate some of her fries."}
{"text":"Nice place, good bar.
Captured a nice moment in a comfortable eatery. 
Ordered the chicken sandwich added avocado, (thankful for that!). Bar was great. Solid bartenders good service, but the worst $17 sandwich I've ever eaten. I was in a hurry &  ate the chicken & Avo, took off the thick & way too hard panini grilled bread roll (not a good choice). The fresh green beans were delicious, I enjoyed most of those. I did ask the waitress if i should have been able to see the shiitake mushrooms & brie that were listed in the menu.  She said 'yes', they definitely forgot them. I only added avo but had not removed anything when I ordered. The waitress looked over evidence( the bun) and it was obvious there were none. She offered me a complimentary dessert, I declined. & then complimentary drink, I graciously declined as I needed to get to my gate to catch my flight.  I appreciated her effort, i hadn't complained, until it dawned on me that it wasn't a good sandwich. The service was thankfully very good, 'my' sandwich, the absolute worst $17 sandwich to date. But hoping yours will be better, its always nice to find delicious food during the long hours involved in airline travel. But I do recommend the Service & cold beer."}
{"text":"We stopped here at the Phoenix Airport and I am glad we did. I got a chicken melt and it was delicious. My co-worker got a steak salad and we shared creme-brule. Everything was very unique and hand crafted. Took you away from the airport. It was great for our obnoxiously early planning. The food was really good, but maybe a little too good. It is a very specific crowd that is going to like this restaurant due to a very narrow upscale, but tasty menu. Just an advisory for those looking."}
{"text":"My server Matthew was amazing BUT, when my food came out my fries were ice cold and my sandwich was hot, I asked for warmer fries and by the time they came they were hot and my sandwich was cold. I told my server while he was exceptional I would like to discuss my food with the manager who took his sweet time getting over to me and when we did he shrugged it off and told me \"we are an airport restaurant\" like it didn't matter. He then discounted me a grand total of $4.56 on a $20 sandwich (w tax).
Save your money and go eat somewhere the manager actually cares."}
{"text":"Service absolutely sucked, and beer and food are not up to their marketed image. Bad even for an airport."}
{"text":"Very poor service. 25 minutes to get fries and vegetables. Ordered wine and coke. Only got the coke. Reordered the wine. Still waiting for the fries and green beans. This is my second visit to this location and it has not improved since my first time here 2 months ago. Again, very slow on food delivery  Much better service at Kierland. Too bad. I expected better.  They have enough servers to do better. Management needs to be more present and observant. It took 25 minutes to get my order of fries and green beans. The server said '\"sorry the kitchen is really slow today.\" Had a flight to catch so asked we for it to go. The fries and green beans were cold when delivered. Also the green beans were very greasy. I won't go back for the food or service."}
{"text":"15$ mimosa.  Mehh. Decent service for an airport bar. Menu was limited at my early Arrival. I opted for a liquid breakfast."}
{"text":"I ordered the red wine pork belly & it was good. Next, I tried the Duck Pate & it was ok. I played with the fig that was served with the pork belly & put some on the pate since I'm not too crazy about the mustard & it complemented the pate somehow. The toasted slice of bread was good and toasted the way I liked it. Service was good.  If I'm Phoenix bound again, I will return to sample the other food in their menu. I give this place 3.5 stars for now"}
{"text":"great spot for a really good meal in Term 4 at the airport. Full bar, dining area and a togo bar if you got tied up at the TSA checkpoint (it happens). Across from gate C11"}
{"text":"Super pleasant surprise to have breakfast here! Excellent menu, delicious food, awesome service. This place is outstanding for an airport bar/restaurant!! Made our PHX layover way better than most--thank you!!"}
{"text":"Only had drinks here, but service is excellent and they have power outlets next to every seat. Kick ass!"}
{"text":"while stuck in PHX and hungry get some Zinc Brasserie.

I was in for a lay over at 10:00 am and desperately desperately  eggs!

Other spots were switching to lunch but they were serving until 10:30 YAY!

I got the amazing ham, cheese, omelette with shoe string potatoes on top, passion fruit tea, Americano to go.

Omelette had a cheese blend that reminded me of cream cheese and swiss.  very French.  Very tasty.  Perfect portion size.  Hit the spot.

My server was so very very nice and attentive to my requests I was so thirsty and filled me up every time quickly.  Food was great.  Service great.  Yummmmmy."}
{"text":"While the quality of food is good at this post TSA restaurant at PHX, it is dreadfully overpriced.  No wine went below $10.00 per glass (even if that same bottle was less than $10.00 per bottle of the supermarket.  No dish went below $15.50.  For this reason I ordered the Pate Maison (couldn't bring myself to order French Onion Soup for the same price).    If you have deep pockets, this is the place to eat at in PHX."}
{"text":"Good stop for a sit down meal at the airport. Not too loud, like many restaurants today. Decent meal and nice people. A little over priced, like any restaurant in the airport. Only negative was that they seated us next to the servers' stand. No restayrant should seat anyone in that location."}
{"text":"I had the croissant and ham with two eggs fried while on a lay over flight. The croissant was so buttery and fresh, lightly toasted that it melted in my mouth. The service was prompt, food hot and fresh. I wish I could go more often. Totally loved it"}
{"text":"Laying over at Sky Harbor, so my husband and I decided to get a bite to eat. Although Zinc Brasserie was a little pricey, the service was prompt and pretty much wonderful !  
My husband had the iceberg salad which he enjoyed. I ordered the flat iron steak salad with added slices of tomatoes and avocados. It was amazingly delicious and quite large, so my husband helped me finish it off. 
We will definitely eat here again. #keto"}
{"text":"Service is fine, wait for the upsell, it comes every time. Menu is small and the food is overpriced even for an airport. $16 gets you a big salad with $3 worth of meat and a giant pile of iceburg lettuce (which adults know has almost zero nutrition). This is place is all about profit margin. Aside from the bloody mary I ordered, I actually regret not going to McDonald's instead (and I hate mcds)."}
{"text":"This is a very good place to hang out if you are stuck at the Phoenix airport. Ty was our waiter and did a great job! Witty and prompt. Heard a couple next to us arguing about splitting the meal because of the condiments, he split the burger snd gave them the condiments on the side. Bravo."}
{"text":"Why have the pretense of a wait list if you give tables away to people who walk in & sit down wherever they like?   If service matters to you spend your money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times while connecting in phx. Several good meals here, always great service! 


Although my last time was the most disappointing with the food. $11 for a piece of crap breakfast sandwich that I got to go and didn't open until I was on my plane."}
{"text":"The menu was not too large, but the food was excellent with appropriate portions.  I got the French onion soup, which was very good, and a house salad which was also very food.  Service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop before my flight and got the Ham and Gruyere Baguette. Great taste, though the bread seemed a little to big and fluffy, but the caramelized onions added a nice sweet touch. The fries were seasoned with spices and tarragon, and were accompanied with ketchup and some type of aioli. At $14 it was pricey, but isn't all airport food pricey? 
I was just glad to get a decent lunch in an airport and this place delivered."}
{"text":"$7.00 frites cold and could have been from a fast food restaurant. Save yourself $ and walk to a burger joint! Service fast"}
{"text":"How does one arrive at PHX three hours early for a flight and miss it? Well, you stop into Zinc Brasserie with your love, order up charcuterie, salad, sammies and Champagne and lose track of time. 

What do you do when this happens? Stop at US Airways service desk and get booked for next flight, call your love to meet you at Zinc again, and laugh! 

This Scottsdale institution has a surprisingly lovely  -- tin ceilings; cool lighting -- outpost in the airport, serving up some of their signature dishes and beverages with the same hospitality and flair as the original location. 

You can take away food for your flight, but I'd definitely dine in with time or a layover. Anything but typical airport food and dining experience. 

* extensive wine list, including by the glass * 

** salads are super fresh and creative ** 

*** delicious onion soup ***

**** many dishes feature high quality cheeses, for fellow turophiles ;) **** 

***** our server was super, from the OG location: he has sabred more than 100
bottles of Champagne! *****"}
{"text":"I travel frequently with Southwest and super glad that Zinc is located in the Southwest terminal! If I'm waiting for a flight, I'll swing by and have a glass of wine or beer, the flat iron steak salad and a side of fries. You'll love the flat iron steak salad if you love bleu cheese because of the dressing and tons of Roquefort crumbles! I don't even love bleu cheese but this is such a good salad!  The fries are delicious crispy shoestring fries, too.  The service here is always great even when they're busy. I look forward to going here every time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Meh. Food was ok but way over priced for what you get. 4$ for avocado is a little extreme. But, this is the airport so you're swindled no matter where you go."}
{"text":"Seriously? $3.50 for a loss cup of coffee, $13.00 for a marginal breakfast. Even for an airport, this place is one to stay away from. The two stars are only because the server was nice."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, lots of seating, nice bar area.  Really like this place because its reliable and the food was great.  And the bartenders are friendly, fast, and attentive."}
{"text":"Review based on the food only******

Don't come here for the anticipated service and fine dinning atmosphere. Come here for the fine wines, cold beer and the red wine braised pork belly. It's simply amazing. Don't be tempted to order anything else but a nice glass of wine and the pork belly. The pork belly here is some of the best I have had. You wouldn't expect this type of food in the middle of an airport in phx. I have many choices were I can spend my money but when I am stuck in the phx airport I choose to spend it here. Simply awesome."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast! Timely and friendly service. Enjoyed my crepes with fruit garnish and husband's French toast. Both were delicious! The paprika frites were quite tasty too!"}
{"text":"On the far end of Terminal 4 where the Southwest flights depart from the C gates, there exists one final dining opportunity, at least one that doesn't require you to stand and eat with one hand and down a beer with the other. As if you are strolling on the Champs-Élysées in April, it's a small but bustling French brasserie that serves standard dishes like crepes, baguette sandwiches, and onion soup gratinee, as well as higher end plates such as steak frites, mussels mariniere, and pâté. I have to admit I don't come to Phoenix thinking I want a French classic meal. Chili maybe, burritos sure, escargots?...jamais!

I was trying to eat smartly before my flight home and ordered the $16.50 Shaved Grilled Chicken Salad, which was quite s pile of gem lettuce and torn basil almost completely covered by focaccia crisps and Parmesan shavings with bits of chicken barely visible underneath, and all of it somewhat overwhelmed by the Parmesan vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/2EW3gGG). It was marginally disappointing, so it was a good thing my colleague shared a $9.50 order of the House Frites, which were plentiful and crispy with a smoked paprika aioli and house ketchup for dipping (photo: http://bit.ly/2BoCOWu). Even on an expense account, I still felt it was pricey for airport dining.

FOOD - 3 stars...just a bit much for a pre-flight meal
AMBIANCE - 3 stars...it's the airport...duh
SERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty fast because they have to be
TOTAL - 3 stars...if you really need fine French dining at the airport after security"}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant where people actually have somewhere to go, the service is painfully slow! No water refills even though I drained mine in the first 30 seconds, no asking if we need anything else, It was a slow and painful experience. 

We had omelette, crepes, and zinc croissant. I am a fairly light eater but found myself still hungry after my zinc croissant (even after including the offensive FOUR DOLLAR upcharge for a single tomato slice). My husband was still hungry after his omelette and so both of us foraged on the ample remainder of our kids' crepes. The crepes were not good, but we were still hungry. Way too strong cinnamon flavor and just a funky taste with the creme fraiche. Will I be back next time I'm wasting time in terminal four at Sky Harbor? Sorry, no, this restaurant is a huge fat fail."}
{"text":"OMG - I don't normally review unless I've had a complete experience - however what's giving them 2 stars is total price gouging. My wife and I were going to purchase two ready made chicken sandwiches on wheat bread - nothing special - sure they looked good enough to eat... but for $12 each - $24 for 2 sandwiches that were plastic wrapped, made who knows when, refrigerated... $24 really??? That's totally crazy! We ended up just a few doors down at Cartel Coffee Lab where for $7 each ($14) we bought two made to order sandwiches on ciabatta bread. That's more like it..."}
{"text":"I was delayed for the first time in a long time in my home airport #PhoenixSkyHarbor and decided to try Zinc. In all fairness it's airport terminal food so the expectations are not the same. I ordered the Red Wine Short Rib Baguette and a Paulaner Hefi-Weizen. The cost again airport terminal food was higher than expected and the value did not equate. The Baguette was more like a Panini and had maybe 2oz of meat. The presentation was very good with a touch of sophistication but not for the cost. There are many options in #terminal4 but this one I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Most airport food sucks, let's all agree gang.  But this place was really, really good for food you ingest prior to running down the airport concourse!

I had the Shortrib Sandwich and fries, hubby had an omelet.  Both were really good, the shortrib was very tender, and not at all fatty.  We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were friendly and efficient.  

If you are flying in or out of Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor, I think you will get a decent meal."}
{"text":"I usually stop over here for lunch or dinner before my flights from PHX. I've tried different entrees here, including the zinc burger, the grilled chicken paillard, and a few other sandwiches. Food quality is average here, and as most airports, these guys are overpriced too. $17 burgers should really good in my opinion, and this place doesn't meet my expectations in that regard. Their entree options are quite limited too. An average overall experience."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would. If I could go back in time and choose a different location to go spend my money at in the airport I would. Corey H (13066) was our server (unfortunately).  I ordered a Jamison chilled, no ice. Well I'm not a liquor expert but I know what Jamison taste like. When Corey H brought me the drink it didn't not taste like a Jamison. When I asked Corey H if it was really Jamison he explained to me that it was chilled and watered down and kept going with that's why it tasted the way it did. I excused it. My friend ordered food and we got some beers. Well it took Corey time to check in on us. Which was disappointing as the bar was basically empty. So I let it go and I ordered another beer as I was disappointed in my order. I did order a shot of Jack chilled. When it came it did not look like a true jack shot. I tasted it and was not able to tell what it was. I then asked my friend who was with me to try it and see if it tasted like jack. Well my friend who has ran a bar. Worked in the bar industry for the past 10 year even agreed it wasn't Jack. At that point we're over it and ready to go and board our flight. We sat for about 10 minutes until I began playing with my credit card in my hand and another worker saw and went to grab Corey. At that time Corey brought us out bill. Even though I spent $48 and some change  on two water down shots and two bottle beers rounded my card up to the nearest dollar and was going to leave a cash tip. I signed my receipt and was going to give Corey an additional tip in cash. Corey walked up and took the receipt before I could get in my wallet as I was finishing my beer and announced loudly \"thank you for my dollar tip\" which I found to be rude and very unprofessional. Especially when I was about to give him cash. I have never been so embarrassed for someone more in my life. I would suggest going to a different restaurant/bar. Especially if Corey H (13066) is you're server. I think he need a different career as I had a cash tip but he decided to make excuses about the poor drinks and be rude about the card tip. I always round of my card and leave cash tips. Well due to his rudeness he didn't get the cash tip, I've never in my life had a server say something to that extreme... please train or hire better people when I'm paying $48 for 2 shots and 2 beers to have a little more class."}
{"text":"I just had a couple adult beverages before my flight today and paid. I honestly didn't leave a 20% tip, mainly because $30 for two drinks always pains me before a flight. Even though I only tipped about 10% the bartender figured out which flight I was on because I neglected to put my credit card away. When I boarded, the gate agent gave me my credit card. I could not have been happier and unexpectedly surprised. I wanted to go give him an extra tip but unfortunately this review was the best I could do since I was already boarding."}
{"text":"I am a frequent flyer and have found that is getting rare to find a good place to grab a bite before a flight, this place included. I had the burger and it was over cooked dripping with grease.  The frittes that came with it work half undercooked and half crunchy straws. My server came by only three times; once to take my order, once to grab my credit card and lastly to drop it off. I came at a slow time where I watched the servers gather to talk and not take care of their customers. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"We came here while waiting for our flight. Our beers came quick and we were grateful for that. However, the first dessert we ordered was sold out, and the second we ordered took 22 minutes to arrive. Creme brûlée. My wife said it was tasty. The manager of the restaurant said that 20+ minutes was a normal time when busy. However, the restaurant is dead. Few folks at the bar. Like us. Just waiting for dessert. Not a fan. The nice folks behind the bar deserve multiple high fives and they tried to make up for the managers poor nature. Brian the manager has the worst customer service I could imagine for someone in his position.  Proceed with caution."}
{"text":"I was definitely surprised and happy to find this classy of a restaurant in the Phoenix airport. I started with a glass of Penfolds Cabernet/ Shiraz which was outstanding. The menu has small selection of main courses, which for an airport when you're on the run is perfect. I ordered the Flat Iron Steak Frites plate (minus the Frites, I'm in a low carb diet). And I had a dinner salad with Parmesan Vinaigrette dressing. I've never had that type of dressing before and was actually very impressed, it's now on the \"checklist\" of salad dressings now if you know what I mean. Now I have to talk about the steak. This is an airport, and airport restaurant so I really wasn't expecting much; well I was more than pleasantly surprised! I ordered the steak medium and they cooked it perfectly. The cut of meat was red, moist and extremely tender! I never would have expected this for airport cuisine! I am a steak aficionado (in my own mind , lol) and I would put this up against any steak I've ever had in Arizona!  Why is this restaurant not in my hometown, Tucson and why is it at the airport?  Lastly my server was Kaitlin and she was amazing! Fast, courteous and informative!  I highly recommend this establishment if your ever in the Phoenix Airport, Terminal 4!"}
{"text":"Early flight out and needed to feed my face so we picked this spot.  Going in we knew it was going to cost more than it was worth - hello!!! Airport food.  But we wanted to sit someplace for awhile other than the gate.  So let's break it down shall we:

16oz diet Pepsi - $3.29
cup coffee         - $4.00
1 omelet            - $15.50
1 chicken salad - $15.50
Slow lackadaisical service - priceless

We got tired of waiting for our server to come back so we raided another table just for some salt and pepper!!  The food wasn't bad tasting but as we are in and out of that airport often we will either stop someplace before we hit there or try a different over priced place in the airport."}
{"text":"Stopped in here back2back weeks wth travels for food.

Pro
Pate plate is good but cheese plate is home run.
French onion soup is super legit.
Burgers and omelette are big and good!
Deep wine selection. 


Cons
Only beer and wine, no hard. 


Meh:
No bathrooms, gotta walk into the terminal
Hostess was ok, server was good!"}
{"text":"One of the best airport restaurants anywhere.  You'll get top-quality food and fast service here, unlike most in-airport restaurants.

The menu has a decent variety from simple to high end.  There are some neat sandwich options like the ham with Gruyere and some other unexpected ingredients (forgot them all now).  If you're keeping it light there are several very good salad options.

Price...well it's upscale food at an airport, so it's not cheap, but I didn't feel it was out of line either."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the decor for being at an airport.  Overpriced wines with limited selection (didn't even have a cab available).  Ordered a steak and salad... steak was refrigerated cold... overall, not impressed."}
{"text":"I will pay the best compliment I can give to any eatery in an airport: I would eat here even if I wasn't in the airport. Delicious food, and I have received very hospitable service in both of my visits. The staff knows the menu, the ice tea keeps coming. Poker belly appetizer with cinnamon and fig and a burger cooked a real medium per request were both fantastic."}
{"text":"For airport restaurant food, not bad. Was waiting for a flight today so tried this place for lunch. Nice healthy choices as well as the standard burgers and steaks.  Manager and staff seem to be on top of things.  Don't rush the dishwashing; manager knows what I am talking about.  Next time I am in Phoenix and at the airport will try again for a possible upgrade in this review."}
{"text":"Who the f*ck reviews a restaurant in the Phoenix airport? Food/booze while traveling is meant to be purely utilitarian - you consume some unhealthy item, quickly, which enables you to drink more. Yeah, that's what I thought too, but then I tried this joint and liked it so much I actually sought it out from the D gates, months later, when on a similar layover.

Being on the west coast and a frequent Southwest customer (and one of those people who loves to be on the first flight of the day), I'm generally skirting through PHX before 10am, which enables me to have the breakfast sandwich. A buttery croissant with a fried egg and gruyere. So damn good - enough to make you temporarily forget about the inconvenience of flying through Phoenix. The Bloodies don't hurt either.

The bartenders and servers are also super nice. To be fair, this is early in the morning when things are relatively uncrowded.

In short, I am this person: http://www.theonion.com/article/frequent-flyer-knows-out-of-the-way-airport-bar-th-1378 and you should trust my airport recommendations."}
{"text":"Arriving to the airport several hours early landed me here in this lovely restaurant. All the seats, from booths to bar stools, have electrical outlets. Was the menu slim and overpriced? Of course, it's in the airport. But the quality and flavor of the food itself was fantastic! Their French fries and aioli sauce could have been a meal on its own, I loved it. My waiter, Tarry, was so attentive and sweet. It's a wonderful hidden gem away from the chaos of PHX."}
{"text":"I purchased a Grilled Chicken Curry Sandwich to go to take on the plane. I do have to say this was the best airport food I had so far and have never given any airport food 4 stars before. The filling was delicious and enhanced with sherry soaked raisins. The bread was a good quality made with grains and had a slight sweetness that paired well with the sandwich filling. My sandwich stayed neat and never got messy to eat. The bread stayed dry and didn't get soaked by the chicken salad.
 
This sandwich did cost $13.00 but I thought it was worth it. 

My husband felt different and enjoyed his $5.99 burrito from somewhere else."}
{"text":"It was fine.  Not great.  Very few veggie options.  And, my salad and Bloody Mary cost my $25 before tip.  In a pinch, yes.  Otherwise, No."}
{"text":"If you like inattentive service than this joint is for you. 
You want your burger to look like it got into a brawl in the back than this joint is for you.
You want to wait  10 minutes after you sit down for your drink order to be taken then this joint is for you?

Oh no? run away then and hope the other resturants opening up in terminal 4 open soon."}
{"text":"Sitting at airport for breakfast, had to oatmeal, huge bowl of steel cut and few berries. It's good but way too sweet and runny!!!! Too much vanilla in it.
There are only a very few customers at bar and service is awful.  She keeps seeing my coffee cup is empty and not once asked to refill it, very annoyed! So if you want more coffee, you have to get her attention or just grab it yourself. She's a mean one!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by during my layover in Phoenix hoping for a place to enjoy a drink and charge my phone. I was seated quickly and the server came over right away. He was very gluten free aware and helped me navigate to the steak salad with the mustard champagne, instead of blue cheese dressing. 

I enjoyed a couple of 11.00 house glasses of wine while I charged my phone and ate. There are chargers all around the restaurant, pretty much at every table, which was awesome. The salad was ok, iceberg lettuce can only be so appetizing. The steak and dressing were tasty, it wasn't till I was almost done with the salad that I realized they hadn't put the crumbled blue cheese on it. Apparently they assumed if I couldn't have the dressing the cheese itself was also off limits. They brought me a little and I enjoyed it with the remainder of my salad.

Salad was a good portion and about 16.00. Overall portions were good on both wine and food. Service good and very prompt. Price expensive, but hey, it's airport food. 

Atmosphere is nice with comfortable booths, high top tables and a bar with tv. Also lovely windows overlooking the runway. I'd certainly stop in here again on another layover."}
{"text":"When hungry for alittle something in Terminal 4, stop and try the Mac and Cheese ... Yum yum :-)  They offer it with Ham - i had that served on the side ... delish :-)  my compliments to the Chef !!"}
{"text":"Best food in an airport I have had.very good appetizers and entrees Beer and wine selection very good"}
{"text":"I decided to have the crepes for breakfast during a long layover this morning. The food was good, but not my favorite. The crepes weren't super sweet, but just sweet enough.

Service could use a little work... I had my order taken by the manager, then water brought by one waiter, my drink brought by another waiter, the crepes brought by a third waitress, and then a fourth waitress took care of my check. Wow!"}
{"text":"Service was just alright, staff talked about how much they were ready to go home though openly in front of customers.

I didn't get a receipt for my meal there and there is no phone number to call as airport assistance told me no establishments have phones(!?) in the airport.  Not sure how I'm supposed to contact anyone at the restaurant."}
{"text":"The Grilled Chicken Paillard is exceptional. The chicken, chutney, gravy, and potatoes combine to create a savoury comfort meal at a quality that is gourmet. This is the best meal I've ever eaten at an Airport."}
{"text":"Provender: the food? Meh. Don't order the fruit, unless you're a vegan and have no other option. This is more like a 2-star but the staff makes it better.

Prices: pricey, but hey . . . it's an airport restaurant.

Parking: N/A.

People: weary travelers arriving at or departing from Phoenix.

Perks: it's located near the C terminal."}
{"text":"I got 2 perfectly made drinks (double jack and coke!) while sitting at the bar and the pork belly starter was REALLY delicious!  It came with sliced green apples on top, arugula(I think?), and some fig spread that made the pork belly dish perfect.  Went great with a whiskey drink!

I will return!  It's worth the walk away from your own concourse if you have the time."}
{"text":"The worst breakfast I ever had.  I had two pieces of crispy bacon, a spoonful of scrambled eggs, burnt croissant, and had to get a latte from down the hall because their machine was broken.  It was just a sad, sad, sad breakfast.

However the waiter was nice but that didn't make up for the bad breakfast.

Also, because the latte machine was broken I got to have an amazing latte just down the way.  Shame I forget the name!"}
{"text":"This place is great, the service was quick and friendly unlike a few other places in PHX. We were quickly seated even though the restaurant looked packed.

Our server promptly came over and grabbed our drink order and brought us waters. We informed him that we were being delayed 2 hours and he was extremely accommodating and told us to please take our time.

We had a few rounds, my wife wines and myself across the board which I love to do. Local beers, imports and great drinks were all amazing.

We finally decided what we wanted to eat and our order was taken, our food came out quickly and was perfect. Both of us got the Flat Iron Steak, awesome for airport standards and up there with a good restaurant which you would go to for dinner around town.

The steaks were done to request, Medium Rare and Pittsburgh/Black & Blue style. Tender, juicy and filling.

We asked for our check and it was actually lower than we had planned on which was a pleasant surprise. A very reasonable dinner while we waited.

Go here and bypass the other restaurants as the service and promptness alone make it worth your time."}
{"text":"Better than average airport food.  Decent prices.  Normally I never even review airport restaurants.  but the service and food are above par."}
{"text":"This is the best food I have ever had at an airport. I ordered a basil chicken baguette. The baguette is very warm, soft and the chicken is very tasty.  Katlin, my server, is friendly and professional. I know where I will dine from now on at the PHX."}
{"text":"Service could use a little work, the waitstaff and hostess were obviously scuffling. 

Ordered the zinc omelette on a 45 minute layover in Phoenix after traveling from the east coast and overall, they were very fast (got to my gate 20 minutes early) and it was the best version of a ham & cheese omelette I've ever had. Decent amount of ham and nice cheeses. 

I'd go back next time I'm in Phoenix  Sky Harbor!"}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time in airports so I understand the difference between airport box meals and restaurant cuisine and this restaurant did not live up to any standards. I was there on St. Patricks day and by that evening there were only a few items left on the menu and the bartender did not seem apologetic about it. I ordered the short rib baguette and could not finish it because the taste was so bitter that it was disgusting on top of it the bartender never asked me about how my food was until after 20 minutes when I told him to take it away because it was unsalable. I had originally wanted the soup but they were out, then I asked for the crab cakes and they were out so I settled in that sandwich. The service was poor and I was disappointed since the restaurant was recently opened the expectation is that the food would be better to attract a clientele. Finally, when I ordered my drink they were out of limes, how does a bar run out of limes.?"}
{"text":"Everyone who gives his place bad reviews seems to be based on the price. The menu is right outside the opening. You can see the prices before you decide to eat here. The food is really good considering you are eating at an airport restaurant. If you have sometime to kill at the airport. I recommend eating here."}
{"text":"It seems when you cross through airport security the terminals become a desert of food choices, a wasteland of fast food and Starbucks.

We chose this restaurant because it was the only sit down near the terminal. The wait staff was either very good or just phoning it in. Fortunately we had the good.

It's not very often that hubby and I order the same thing. This time we did and it was good. We had (drumroll please) the pork belly sandwich. The sandwich was served hot but the fries were lukewarm. The sandwich was accompanied by a suitable serving size of a delicious spread. 

The missing star is due to the disconnect with the serving staff. Some of the staff stood in a huddle reminiscent of a kindergarten soccer team. The huddle moved from area to area. A table near us was not attended. A server learned of the situation and instead of stepping up and handling the problem he called out to another server to let another server know. That's annoying."}
{"text":"The Alastian Tart was amazing and unlike anything I've ever had. Service was great. It's located near C13 in terminal 4."}
{"text":"I went here a few months ago and ordered their shaved grilled chicken salad.  The description said the dressing was a 'Parmesan vinaigrette.'  It was more like a traditional creamy Caesar dressing.  There was so much cheese on top, it felt like I was eating cheese with a little bit of lettuce and chicken thrown in.  It was definitely not a healthy salad, so I was disappointed (I'm not interested in eating salads that are 800+ calories- if I want to consume that amount of calories, I'd rather eat pasta or dessert).  I wouldn't go back the next time I have a layover."}
{"text":"Asked the server for menu.. he said \" one minute please!!\" After 15 minuets still NO one bringing us the menu.
Went to asked the manager in charge... \" why so hard to have someone bring us the menu???\" He replied \" What's menu??\".   WTF.  This was on Jan 25th around 8 pm.  I hope Zinc management read my feedback and fired that manager duty......Sad!!!!"}
{"text":"Rating four stars bc it's nice to see a restaurant like this one in an airport!  The food is tasty & they have lots of power outlets around many of the tables to plug in and charge up.  Convenience of outlets alone is making me think I should have given it 5.

Service still has some kinks to work out as I was initially served the wrong sandwich. However, I took two bites and the pâté baguette (which I would never order) was pretty yummy.  Ultimately got my sandwich & the waiter grew on me...especially when he gave me a new drink to go on my way out.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but not awesome. I guess I expected more out a $15 omelette. My wife's sandwich was good, not amazing. The bottle of wine and the service were really great though. I probably wouldn't go back until I tried some other places first."}
{"text":"This place was great for a quick drink and bite before heading to our flight. Food came out very quick, especially considering the bar was basically full. Our bartender, Todd, was very accommodating and really knew what he was doing! Great bartender! Will definitely visit again anytime we're in the C gate area at the airport!"}
{"text":"Been in the restaurant industry for over 15 years. I must say this place is a overpriced disaster. Take the extra 5 minutes and walk to the other C or D gate restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is extremely over priced. I expect a $17 burger to be cooked to order, it wasn't. And there's nothing about the burger that justifies such a ridiculous price. The staff are clearly bored and have better places to be. Save your money and eat ANYWHERE else when at PHX."}
{"text":"We had a 2 and one half hour layover in Phoenix on our way to Seattle.  Since we had lots of time, we decided to eat at Zinc Brasserie for lunch.  My wife had the basil chicken baguette with brie cheese and I had the French ham and guyere cheese baguette.  Both sandwiches came with French fries.  The fries were sprinkled with paprika and were served with chunky ketchup.  Definitely a notch above most airport food.  Service was excellent.  Cost of meal a little pricey."}
{"text":"For all fellow Mac n cheese enthusiasts: This could be the best Mac n cheese in town! Had the Mac n cheese and a glass of Malbec (Pascual) for lunch. I'm a fan of the menu and the awesome choices for an airport option. Food is well done, atmosphere is great - though the Kierland site is far superior, this is a great option for the airport if you have time. 

Had an hour to kill before our flight and they used every bit of it. Would only caution that you check before sitting down to make sure they can turn a quick meal."}
{"text":"Nothin like a 17$ hamburger and 5$ glass of tea at the airport.  Very nice atmosphere, yummy, but expensive."}
{"text":"Low ratings for service and pricing.

Tip: they only serve breakfast items and a few of the starters before 10am. No salads before 10am.

Tip: the classic breakfast with ham looks more worth it than with bacon

I was seated at a high countertop with outlets which is pretty convenient. I was not asked whether I'd prefer table or countertop. 

When I ordered the classic breakfast for some reason the server assumed I wanted bacon. Instead of asking \"with bacon or ham?\" He just asked \"with bacon?\" Which would make sense if the bacon was more worth it and what more people ordered. 

When I finished the meal my server was nowhere in sight. It took 15 minutes to get my check. When I got the check the server stood there waiting for me to pull out my card and handed me the card processor and told me to follow the instructions on the screen then left. All the instructions were was to add the tip and hand the processor back to the server. In this time the server left and didn't come back so I had to wait to get my receipt.... luckily I was not in a rush for my flight. 

I'm just glad I was on a business trip. I guess that's how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"Got the vanilla spiced oatmeal for $8. It had like 4 slivers of fruit on it. When I asked for more the cashier was super nice, but the chef got feisty about it saying 'well that's a portion'. It's seriously like a huge container of oatmeal and very little fruit to go with it. Alone the vanilla spice is overpowering. The cashier eventually had to go talk to the manager.  This is all while I'm waiting for my plane. For their prices their service should be better and they shouldn't be so stingy with portions."}
{"text":"On our way out of Phoenix a couple months ago we stopped in here and ate before our flight.  The service was really good and our waitress was very attentive. The food was decent, but not anything overwhelming and it took a bit of time to get, so if you are in a hurry for your flight, you may want to skip the sit down part of this place and just get something from the grab-and-go area.  

The overall feel was fun and the people watching was definitely entertaining! The seats were okay, but tightly spaced, so finding somewhere to put our carry on luggage while we ate was difficult, and became more difficult when they sat people on both sides of us despite there being other available seats. The luggage ended up under our table and we were scrunched for foot space.  

Our waitress was really the best part of the whole experience.  She was quick and really nice.  She chatted with us for a few seconds every time she stopped at our table and made us feel welcome.

Overall: Not a bad place to grab a bite if you have a little time to kill before a flight. If you are in a hurry - get something from the grab and go case."}
{"text":"OMG. I ordered the pork belly app and can declare this is the best food I've ever eaten in an airport and the best pork belly I've ever had. Can't wait to fly again."}
{"text":"We stopped in here between flights last Friday. We didn't have a lot of time, I'm sure that is a common problem in the airport, but Jonathan addressed us as soon as we sat down, made some recommendations on the beer and the food, which was very good by the way.

Jonathan was very helpful and courteous. If you are in the airport, check out this restaurant and ask for him by name, don't forget to tip !"}
{"text":"PHOENIX AIRPORT:  What a surprise at the airport; a delicious new American option with an innovative menu.

The ambience and service were both great and there were a ton of attractive items on the menu.

Tried a few menu items:

Pâté (3.5 stars): This was fine; it ha a pretty light flavor and was dense.  It leaned a little much on the bologna side of the spectrum.

Gruyere Burger (4 stars): This burger was really good; thick patty, dense eggy homemade bun, and melted cheese with a hint of truffle.  The fries were okay as well."}
{"text":"The worst BY FAR the worst breakfast at the airport! I paid $20.00 plus tip for 1 egg, 2 tiny pieces of bacon, croissant! I added potatoes which were dry and inedible!!  Do yourself a favor-there are far better places for breakfast. Lesson learned. They get lunch/dinner so right but they should just stop breakfast! Next stop- Starbucks to get a sandwich and fill up!"}
{"text":"Good service. I get the feeling from the other reviews that their lunch and dinner might be good. Their breakfast was not good, and was overpriced even for an airport. My friend's French Toast was extremely dry, and my bacon and eggs was a small portion. Another friend got a Bloody Mary that he enjoyed, until he got the bill. The bartender/server was friendly and attentive.
Would not recommend for breakfast."}
{"text":"Tried to order Washington State mussells, but they were oit.  Bartender recommended the burger, so after some reflection on the distance between mussells and ground beef, I decoded to give it a try.

My medium rare hamburger was medium well, but I tasted it and it was quite edible.  While I typically would return it, I did not have the energy.  It was flavorful, and the frites were good.

Zinc's is a rather quiet place at the end of the walkway, and maybe the mussels got held up in an airplane somewhere.  It was my first chance for mussels in an airport.   Maybe next time.

Eat well, tip well."}
{"text":"While the food was great, the service is really poor. Since the establishment is by the gates, you would think that they would understand that many of the patrons are in a hurry to eat so they can board. 

Not recommended unless you enjoy the French custom of leisurely dining."}
{"text":"I've had (mostly) hit or (some) miss service here but today was EXCEPTIONAL. Terry was my waiter. He was prompt with my drink and food order and was very polite. I sat down at 9:05 and had my check by 9:20. He deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"Well the atmosphere is pleasant and our waitress was sweet. But the food and drinks aren't worth the price and not good quality. Burger overcooked and food bland and drinks weak."}
{"text":"I had a delicious market salad and added the shaves chicken breast. It was really delicious. Fresh greens, nice and tender. Good dressing, and a generous portion size. I definitely recommend this place in the airport instead of the Mexican restaurants all over the other concourses."}
{"text":"The bartender was a complete sweetheart and recommended the best food I have ever eaten before in an airport. It was nice, they had charger plug-ins under the bar, which was extremely convenient. 
The chicken with the mushrooms and green beans was to die for, and the pink lemonade champagne with vodka was amazing, as well. I definitely recommend this location!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in Sky Harbor to grab drinks and some food between flights. The bar staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to eat at Sky Harbor. Food was great. I have been here twice now once for lunch and once for breakfast. The coffee is outstanding. Both of my meals were great. The service is 1st class which you won't find anywhere else at this airport."}
{"text":"I had exactly 55 min between flights.
It was 9 am Phoenix time....
As I walked by the bar...the most delicious Bloody Mary caught my eye.. I began to bargain with my wife ...\" are you hungry ? We could eat here ...and perhaps I could get a Bloody Mary ???\" A deal was struck.
We explained to the hostess our time limit.
She told us not to worry.
We were sat and ordered two Bloody Mary's stat !! They offered a double for $1.50 more ... yeah !!! We also ordered the French toast.  We had our drinks within 4 min. Delicious !!! Our food was there in 8 min .  And holy cow !! This was not your typical airport food !!! This was a French toasted slice of heaven !! It was a cross between pound cake and French toast and absolutely delicious.
 The server was on top of everything , never had to ask for anything or motion to her. Perfect !! I will be going there next time through fo sho !!  Oh by the way , full cocktail menu . Can't wait to try some of the other yummy drinks waiting to be sipped !"}
{"text":"A buddy of mine and I stopped here on a layover in July. We both had a beer and shared a burger (came out to $50) and then jumped on our flight. 40 minutes later we were both puking our guts out. I left a comment on their FB page, and their actual response was \"maybe it was elsewhere. It's an airport bitch. Maybe something you touched. dumbass Bitch\". Just wow!"}
{"text":"This is not airport food.  Spend an extra couple of bucks if you have the time for made to order food.  My simple burger was excellent."}
{"text":"You're going to eat here because you've got time to kill and nowhere else to go, but beware, the manager (Brian), is condescending and arrogant. The only person who deserves praise is my wonderful rock star server, Kaitlin, who saved the day with a wonderful disposition and demeanor. 

Brian was very rude. I politely approached him asking who my server would be, and he asked where I was sitting. In a non-chalant tone, he responded \"yeah, he'll be right there, we are busy.\" It's obvious that they were busy, but that wasn't my question. I was simply asking who my server was so I could flag him/her in an ocean of people. I then responded, \"I understand, I'm just asking who my server is.\" He said \"yeah, we are busy\" in an arrogant way. Ya think?!

Kaitlin, on the other hand, managed the situation like a pro. She offered an apology in a genuine way, and offered stellar service. She even gave me a pastry at the end. 

As far as the food and beverages go, it's extraordinarily pricey, but what I ordered didn't disappoint. Pork belly and Mac & cheese were flavorful and fresh. Their wine selection wasn't bad either.

However, the spoiler was Brian. If you're willing to get an attitude along with long waits, then go for it. As I said, you're stuck in an airport with nowhere else to go... just be forewarned."}
{"text":"The Mac and Cheese is AMAZING! 
Jonathan the mixologist made a great recommendation after we had a horrible experience at a place a few doors down. He was outstanding and very personable. He gave us the basic options then enthusiastically asked if we wanted to \"go wild\"... we couldn't turn down the opportunity. What we got was the appropriately named \"Jonathan special\". 
Our \"wild Jonathan special\" included two difference cheeses with ham, bacon lardons, and red peppers. I still drool when thinking about it. If you're ever traveling in Phoenix airport terminal C, definitely go to Zinc and get wild!"}
{"text":"As any frequent flier, I keep my expectations for airport food at a reasonable level. I am perfectly set with a protein bar, very happy with a Five Guys burger, and thrilled with Rick Bayless's place (thanks O'Hara!). All that said, I was shocked at the food quality at ZINC in the Phoenix airport. I had the pork belly appetizer and it was on par with Michelin star restaurants - perfectly braised, perfectly fatty, perfectly meaty with an unexpectedly delicious fig mostarda and a side of arugula for a sharp finish to a perfect bite. If this is the new way airport food is going, bring it on!"}
{"text":"Considering the fact that you are at an airport folks, yes, this is as good as it gets.  Really.  What other airport restaurant compares?  Sbarro?  Some silly Mexican restaurant with fake tub mix marguerite?  Some slimey pizza joint?  And if you're inclined to drop a few Ben Franklins on some expensive wine, voila, ici vous allez!  Nice big round bar in the middle for loners, and BTW airports, most people travel alone so let's make your friggin bars larger eh?  Great Frenchie menu too."}
{"text":"Basil grilled chicken baguette...... Amazing


Expresso martini.... Amazing!

And.... Service from Beth behind the bar who I have encountered twice now flying out.... So personable and down to earth.

I myself work in the industry and it's hard going out because I pick things out constantly about what is wrong.  There was nothing wrong about my experience today.

Next time I fly out hopefully it's in the C terminal of southwest and I get to come back!"}
{"text":"Traveling is the worst. This place makes it much less bad. This is in my top 10 airport restaurants list, despite the relatively high prices. The atmosphere helps you forget you're in an airport, and the food is very high quality."}
{"text":"Upscale place. Trendy and sophisticated menu and mixed drinks. Perfect place to wait for your flight. The pork belly baguette is really good."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for dinner and a glass of wine before boarding my flight. Saadiq, the hostess, was extremely friendly and prompt in finding me a seat at the community table, despite the airport and restaurant being very crowded during the holiday time. Stephen was my server and he was great. He greeted me almost as soon as I sat down and provided excellent and quick service. I barely decided what to eat before he already had my glass of wine in front of me. I ordered the steak and fries. At first the price almost deterred me, but after receiving the plate I was more than satisfied. The serving size did not leave room for disappointment. The steak was cooked (medium-rare) and seasoned perfectly. Thank you for starting my travels out perfectly!"}
{"text":"I had the Alsatian tart appetizer (a whopping $15) and my partner had the dinner omelette. His omelette was good, very cheesy; however, the tart was only partially warmed, and the server didn't know if it was supposed to be a hot or cold dish. The service was decent but it's expensive for small quantities of food."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I only ordered a beer and a side of french fries but it was enough to want to rate them 5 stars. 

The beer was good as it always is and the fries were delicious as well. They were crispy and had this delicious cheese crumble on top. Love it!

This is not what you think of when you think of \"airport food\"!"}
{"text":"Waiter was awesome, food good but wasn't prepared properly, manager while there didn't once check with a guest saw him move about several times even to the table next to us to clean. It's airport and they know people are captive to what's within the. Airport while traveling so there'll be others to pass through will not be my first choice next time I travel"}
{"text":"Very great place to be airport food! Came here for breakfast and enjoyed every moment of it. It makes me want to fly to Phoenix just for a meal! I had the Zinc Omelette along with some coffee. The omelette was superb! Coffee wasn't bad. The star here was the croissant! I had a bite of my mom's and it was great! Buttery and toasted to perfection. I didn't have any add-ons or substitutions so I can't speak on that aspect but the prices here are a little steep, I think it's worth it though. The staff was very friendly and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Overall, a good spot if you have a little time for breakfast before 10am."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang if you are waiting for your flight. Great signature cocktail menu, (Petiller: Sminoff Raspberry Sparkling Pink Lemonade Champagne), um...delicious!!! Menu is nice with great options. This was by far the best airport restaurant I have ever frequented. Samuel was our server, (we were at the bar), and he was fantastic."}
{"text":"Stopped in here when flight was delayed to CA.  From the moment we walked up to the hostess we had great friendly service.  Beer was cold, food was delicious and service terrific.  Made the flight delay painless. Husband ordered ham & cheese baguette and I ordered salad with grilled chicken.  Will stop by again on our next layover."}
{"text":"The drinks were good. I sat at the bar and the bar service was speedy and friendly. The bloody Mary's were good. The prices in an airport are always inflated. This place is no different. It seemed to be more out-of-the-way and not as crowded. I had already eaten but the food looked good around me."}
{"text":"Great fast service, seated right away and waiter came with water and asked for drink order right away. Plenty of plugs for electronics everywhere in the restaurant that was the best part. Food was tasty!"}
{"text":"While in Phoenix Airport I stopped into grab a quick bite...was more than pleasantly surprised how good the food was. 

I had the Grilled Chicken Paillard and it was awesome!  The service was good as well...our waitress was very attentive. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who's looking for good food as well as drinks. 

It has a cool French vibe as well. 

Enjoy... Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Good service with very average tasting food. Money better spent elsewhere. Would have to be a drunk to give them four stars"}
{"text":"My favorite stop for a few preflight sips of wine. Great selection of wines and the food is fantastic as well.  I always try to get to the airport a few minutes early to make sure I have time to stop by.  I even stop here when arriving in Phoenix sometimes lol.
The service is always speedy (great if you are trying to catch a flight) and the staff are all very friendly. Best restaurant experience at Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"Awful breakfast. Rude manager tried to seat us in a small 2 seat booth when the entire restaurant was empty at 7am! When we asked for a larger table she said it doesn't matter because everyone has bags!  We paid $13.50 for a croissant, 2 tablespoons of eggs and two piece of the smallest slices of bacon I have ever seen. After the rude manager ( in the pink sweater) brought the plates to our table, she did not ask us if we needed anything bc she ran off so fast to eat her own breakfast!! We needed salt and pepper and jelly for our crossiant!! The waitress went to the table next to use several times without even even looking our way once. By the time we got her attention our eggs were cold and we were starving. The food was literally a 3 on a 10 scale. Should have went to Panera.. their service is better, even if you have to eat it in your lap!!! Do not go here.. $29.32 for two $5 meals! Melissa (the manager and host) should be fired for her nasty attitude. Also, customers should get more eggs for $13.50"}
{"text":"At the airport ready to take off.. We had an hour before boarding.. We ordered breakfast  and got done in a half hour.. With another half hour to spare.. Loved the food, the ambiance and the service was great!!!  Thanks Tarry for making it a fun start of our journey back home!  Happy Halloween."}
{"text":"Up a notch from the usual fodder, baguettes, salads and entrees.  Pork belly baguette with fig jam, spinach and cheese $16, real frites in a fancy little jar and a $12 margarita.  Very good attentive service."}
{"text":"We all know how expensive airport food can be and about 6 months ago I decided that is just wasn't worth it. I have been pretty successful in avoiding them but last night I got hit with a four hour delay and suddenly dinner was in play.

Sky Harbor is easily one of the best airports for tasty grub and I have visited quite a few and choosing Zinc Brasserie last night came down to location. Food prices are always jarring at an airport but Zinc's will make your jaw hit the floor. 

With that being said I was treated to friendly service, a comfortable seat in a very crowded airport and decent food. It seemed like a relatively fair trade off.

The menu has a French theme and specializes in craft cocktails and wines. If you are a beer drinker, like me, the selection is small. There are 5 taps and they have the American macrobrews, Stella and Kiltlifter by Four Peaks. With the French theme I was hoping for Kronenbourg 1664 on tap.

I ordered the Red Wine Short Ribs Baguette with Frites. The sandwich was dressed with Blue Cheese, Pickled Carrots and Crispy Onions with a Housemade ketchup and Paprika Aioli as dipping sauces for the Frites. 

The Blue Cheese was too generous and overpowered the short rib. When I pulled out some short rib on its own it had a comforting pot roast style taste and the carrot was nicely vinegary and added a lot of contrast. The crispy onion was a waste as it did not offer a crunch and was just there. The baguette was nice and soft and had a more sourdough bite to it. Overall, an ok sandwich.

The frites were a bit of a miss. They had a generous paprika seasoning and the aioli mentioned above was very tasty. The frites were overcooked and undercooked in the same batch. The French having invented  this classic appetizer would be none to happy. Side note I just recently watched this show that said the Belgians actually invented the dish. 

Overall, I ate my dinner like a good boy. My visit was d'accord."}
{"text":"It's not often you find airport food that doesn't bother you on your flight. It's almost impossible to find absolutely fantastic food in the airport like this food.
     Since none in my travel party had eaten, we walked in here for something small to eat before our flight. To our utter surprise the menu looked extremely appetizing. We all had breakfast items. I had the granola and they had egg dishes. The granola was yummy though a faster meal might be better if your in a hurry. It took me sometime to eat it all. It was a big bowl.
    My friends Omelet was probably the best of all of our meals. The little bite I tried was nothing like you'd expect at an airport but fit the expectations you'd have at a french bistro.
     If your in Terminal 4 for a layover and have time to eat, try this spot.
I'm going to go to the one in Scottsdale and hope they are just as good. I'd love to eat the same food without having to fly our of town."}
{"text":"Expensive but great!  Nearly all menu items are above-good, but their omelette will force you to reconsider that Paris trip in favor of going to Terminal 4. 
I actually kinda look forward to Southwest 4506 being delayed... AS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT... boo, Southwest!    
But I eat here all the time.  Would agree with Lee though about the pate being a being bologna.  I've had only good service at the bar and at the tables, but less luck at the \"high tops\" in the bar area.  
Omelette and salad again tonight.  Can hardly wait!!"}
{"text":"This review has been due for a while now, every time we have a flight out of Phoenix Sky Harbor we stop here for a quick bite/lunch or breakfast even which is served until 10:30 AM.

Having tried everything on the menu some of our favorites are

~ warm dungeness crab crepes $20
~ zinc omelette with straw potatoes and creme fraiche $15.50
~ grilled chicken paillard $20
~ classic breakfast $13.50

I cannot rave enough about the Dungeness crabs they are a must try, the crepes are served with tomato lobster cream, butter braised shiitake, caramelized fennel and are perfect everytime.

The Staff is courteous but the food does take a while I wouldn't recommend stopping at the restaurant if you don't have enough time.

Also Zinc Brasserie is a little pricey compared to some of the other options.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Darn it - I wish I would have had more room for my hamburger - I had to do away with that fantastic bun because I wanted to eat all those great fries - thanks God the mac n cheese wasn't any good - that is the reason for four instead of 5 stars here!

The host and the server were both good - timing was ok - and the food was great - except for the mac n cheese - would NEVER order that again. The tea was also great, but if you like it sweet - forget about it - raw sugar doesn't melt in ice tea!

Please was clean with plenty of places to plug in - great for longer layovers!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service for an airport restaurant.  The pork belly dish was to die for, the espresso martini was delightful, but the (overpriced) French onion soup was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Everyone who knows me knows how much I hate mayonnaise. This restaurant apparently puts mayo on everything. But that's ok, it's a French place so not entirely unexpected. And for the sandwiches on the lunch menu it was mentioned in the description on the menu. So, I'm sure if I had eaten here for lunch I would have seen this on the menu and requested that the cook leave off the mayo and it would have been fine. Unfortunately I ate here for breakfast and ordered the crossant sandwich and that did not mention mayonnaise in the description and I never would have thought that it would have it. Nobody likes mayo on their eggs. Do they? Gross. Even after scraping off the offensive condiment, the sandwich was still not very good. The crossant was dense and greasy, the eggs overcooked and rubbery, and the ham made the whole thing way too salty. I did not enjoy it at all. I know you should never had very high expectations at an airport but really this meal was pretty bad. On top of that, as others have mentioned, it was pretty pricey. When filling out my expense report for the trip, this was the most expensive meal I had the whole time!"}
{"text":"This is the most expensive, most horrible, poorest service $90 lunch I have ever had in my life. This place is garbage do not ever eat here!"}
{"text":"I don't generally hold high hopes for airport restaurants but have been here twice as a frequent Reno to Phoenix traveler. Both times the service has been fast, friendly and efficient.

My first visit was just several rounds of drinks.  The ours were strong and the bill came quick. We were coming back from a holiday party so we appreciated the continuation of the fun.

Tonight I had dinner and commandeered a table for about 2.5 hours. The waiter was friendly and accommodating. I had their burger with bacon blue cheese.  YUM! The burger was cooked perfect and the blue cheese was actually a very creamy sauce.  The back on was thick and tasty even though I'm not a bacon fan (yes...I realize I'm nearly unamerican by that comment). 

I never felt rushed especially once the waiter realized I wasn't trying to catch a flight. Will definitely come back.."}
{"text":"I've spent many hours in layoffers in Phoenix and was looking for somewhere to eat that I hadn't tried yet.  Walked all the way to the Southwest terminal to find some authentic French food. I ordered their French omelette and ice tea.  Omelette was very good -- especially with the potatoes on top. When I ordered unsweetened teas, however, it would have been nice if she'd told me it was flavored tea (Caribbean or something like that) and not black tea.  When I questioned that it was flavored, she told me it was unsweetened (duh!) and told that was all they had.  Then just walked away.  I'm not a big fan of any flavored tea but didn't really have a choice on another drink apparently.  

Be prepare to be shoved together with other guests and for crappy service.  Oh....all really high prices.  Skip this place and go somewhere else in the airport."}
{"text":"I got the Pork Belly Baguette and would not recommend it. In short, the pork belly tasted very greasy, and the bread may have been microwaved bc it was extremely chewy and tough. It's definitely not a $17 sandwich. I would've enjoyed a $7 barbecue pork sandwich or a decent burger better than this. I'd maybe give the place another try but definitely wouldn't get the Pork Belly again. Also don't be fooled with the lengthy description of their \"house frites\" for $6. They're your basic skinny French fries, with paprika on them."}
{"text":"This place is a great alternative to the options at Sky Harbor. Yeah, the food is pricey. Yeah, it's heavy on the belly. Yeah, it takes awhile for your order to be ready. But in the end, it's worth it. I've had their sandwiches several times, and they're always top-notch. The pork belly is a bit heavy, but if you have someone to split it with then it's just about perfect. And their fries will knock yours socks off... but chances are you have a spare pair in your luggage, so that shouldn't be a problem. 

If you have a bit of time between flights or before you take off, then you'd definitely do well to pay this place a visit. Sky Harbor has gotten some great places to dine in the past year, and this is definitely one worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, especially at the prices they charge. I ordered a house salad and French onion soup. The house salad was only lettuce with tasteless dressing. Seriously? What about carrots, tomatoes or anything else with flavor? Just lettuce? Come on.

I watched my French onion soup sit for about 5 minutes before it was brought to me. By then it wasn't even warm. The cheese on top was only warm. Not good!

The service was fine and creme brûlée was decent, although it was runny. 

Even though this place is in an airport, food should be better."}
{"text":"Service was good, but food was meh. Onion soup was okay, but not worth $10. The burger was $17.50 and also just okay. I guess for airport food it could be worse!"}
{"text":"Five star find at PHX airport. Delicious steamed mussels in lemon, white wine thyme broth. Perfect early dinner while killing time on our 2 hour layover.
Corey served us with a smile even with a packed house. Michael never stopped cleaning, clearing and setting tables. Great attention to detail guys."}
{"text":"Not friendly at all. 5:50am & I pulled up a set at the bar. I was told \"we are not open\" I said, \"I cannot sit at the bar and wait?\" Response, \"no we are not open.\" I can respect this, so I can e back 10 minutes later & was still ignored by the staff standing around until 6:05 when I was told, \"we running 10 minutes late. \" at 6:10 I was allowed to come in and order a top-shelf drink while the bartender continued to set up for the day. 

To everyone except the bartender, who was nice & just doing her job, \"thanks!\" To the other six people standing around, including the redhead with the bun & glasses, Here is my $42 for 2 minutes of your time. Thanks for existing here at this terminal and sorry to bother you."}
{"text":"$15 for a drink with kahlua and vodka and some milk? I can buy a bottle of booze for $15 and actually feel satisfied after drinking it. The food menu is also over priced. The only reason anyone buys anything is because they are forced to buy food somewhere in the airport harbor and have so few selections. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. Thanks for my $25 bill for two crappy drinks, how do you people sleep at night?"}
{"text":"It makes me sad this place has such low reviews. I've been here a few times while waiting on a flight. The staff has always been super friendly and they don't care I give my pillow it's own chair at the bar. 
First of all I don't know what the freak the menu says. It uses fancy words that I don't even think are really actually fancy. Why can you just write French fries?  The drinks are expensive but I suppose that's what you get for being a morning drinker and drinking at an airport. I was lucky enough to get a cranberry vodka with 2 shots for $10. TRUST ME that's cheap. 

You just have to be nice to the bartender and genuinely make conversation. It's not that hard. I've never experienced a bad worker here at this location. I fly out alot so I'll definitely stop in again for my fancy french fries and my $10 drink."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and excellent service from Terry H.  Not super fast, and not inexpensive, but the nicest place in the airport for sure.  I got an omelet.. breakfast for dinner.  They have a good selection of wines and a full bar as well.  Check them out on the way through."}
{"text":"Best airport burger I've ever had. Zinc served me up a 1/2 pound medium-rare patty - juicy but not bleeding - with some ultra-truffley gruyere melted all over. They burger came on a brioche soft enough to cuddle me to sleep at night but durable enough for the patty (I'm not overthinking this - it matters). It all came with pommel frites, house ketchup, and a paprika aioli that rounded off everything with some subtle smoke. Topped off the feast with a Blue Moon and a conversation with a friendly red headed server. 

If you're going to spend too much money on food at the airport you might as well spend it on good food. Zinc is REALLY good food."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna dreadfully write this place a bad review that's for sure! I love the ambience inside I just wish I got a better experience the first time, cause now I think about it.. Isn't it always about the first time, like you remember everything when you had it your first time. Okay, enough about me going on and on lets get to the point. I wish I had read the reviews but I'm not like that and I just go with it. Me and my roommate had an early flight wanted to get a drink or so we landed at zinc this was about 7 am and let me say this the hostess was more presentable and so appreciated more than the waitress . I don't know what her problem was but it was obviously she didn't want to help us out! I observed her being cheery or fake cheery to other guests and it really took like 10 minutes to get in a food order and she forgot about our kilt-lifters which isn't hard to pour on draft. Aside from this the store was definitely NOT busy. At the end of our experience all I had was a measly croissant, for 6 dollars and beer I really wanted to explore more but I felt like the waitress thought j should know what I want or expected that should know stuff on the menu when I walked in which shouldn't be that way! I'm all about customer service and that lady was something else. By the end I just wanted my check and seriously took more waiting time to get my check as well. Other than that I hope I can return If not this'll be my first and last at this location."}
{"text":"I had the short rib sandwich, it was good but could have used a little more blue cheese.  The smoked paprika aioli was delicious, fries cooked perfectly!  Husband had the French ham sandwich, which was also good!! Service was quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"My favorite in Sky Harbor! Cool vibe, great wait staff and the food is always wonderful. Today I had the Chicken Paillard and the Creme Brûlée and they did not disappoint. Definitely give this place a try if you are stopping over in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G !  Not a spot for you cheap bastards.  This is high quality food and service.  I had Natalie at my waitress and she was a breath of fresh air and easy on the eyes as well. .  Went in thinking this place would be uptight but Natalie was kind and super hilarious!! She recommended the Creme Brûlée french toast and it was on point. Also recommend a mimosa made with fresh orange juice. Definitely what I needed to prepare myself for my family during Christmas time!  definitely worth the higher prices. Can't wait to visit the location in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Ordered double Jack & Coke. Got Jack, Coke, and lots of ICE!! Filled the glass 70% with ice, a good jaw breaker. Price $13.00 + tip."}
{"text":"I visited Zinc Brasserie at Phoenix Airport
to eat dinner because my original flight
was cancelled and I had to wait a few hours in
the airport.

I ordered Grilled Chicken Paillard and 
my colleague ordered Flat Iron Steak Salad.

Both were delicious.

Grilled Chicken Paillard was mixed of
Pomme Puree,Haricot Verts ,Chicken
Shiitakes Mushroom, Tomato,
Garlic basil Jus etc.

unexpectedly, Grilled Chicken Paillard was 
delicious because restaurants in the airport
are usually not delicious.

Steak Salad was made of five pieces of steak,
Lettues, Roquefort, walnut etc.

It was also delicious.

I was tired to wait airplane but I was refreshed
by these delicious food."}
{"text":"Was lucky to find an empty bar seat passing by.
Though the food is pretty good, it is a little expensive, even though that is pretty much a given in an airport restaurant.
I was hoping for more of a vegetarian menu, but lacking that, I went with a short rib baquet. Quite tasty. Fresh baquet bread and good taste to the ribs.
Sam was an excellent bartender/waiter.  Had a great disposition and was always there to fill my drink as well as tending to everyone else.
Nice bar with lots of TVs."}
{"text":"Between my delicious and gigantic omelette, and my fiancé's french toast, we had quite a pleasant breakfast surprise while enjoying an extended layover in the Phoenix airport. 

I always like having the option of sitting down and eating in a comfy banquette setting as opposed to being shuttled through a cafeteria line then searching for an open space to sit and eat somewhere three terminals away...

The coffee tasted freshly pressed, the service was just attentive enough, and I definitely look forward to spending a meal here again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed....first off...sit down at the bar...the IPA no longer served even though it's on the menu...then they run out of Stella....so now I'm down to bottle choices...then I order the burger and fries...and the fryer breaks after my order went in...and I wasnt interested in the other side options..and then it took 30min to get my burger....and on top of all that...no discount off my food for only getting part of what I ordered....yeah won't be back here....too bad...bar area is kinda nice"}
{"text":"Food was great and came quickly. Service was pleasant. Not crowded, seated immediately. Incredibly overpriced. The hostess looked bored out her mind like she hated her job. Mumbling her words, no greeting, bored body language. Even watching her walk back to her station was uncomfortable. If the hostess improved and the food wasn't quite so over price, I'd give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Seriously. This is an airport restaurant/bar. The staff could manage to be even halfway more attentive, and it'd still be reasonable service. So yourself a favor and ask for your your bill immediately after you place your order. It should never be acceptable to avoid eye contact with your customers and make them beg you to bring the check."}
{"text":"Pre flight burger and beer stop. 

I am a regular burger snob at the Kierland Scottsdale location, so I know how their burger is usually properly served (only before 5pm).

What is it about a bar that isn't wiped clean from previous guests??? Can't use the \"in the weeds\" excuse this time (and most of the time). The place is mellow and not jamming.

Asked for the burger medium (some pink), and it was well (no pink). Fries luke warm. Did not ask for the manager as this is a rare time when I didn't want to stir the pot.

Basics: Clean bar. Greeting. Food cooked to order, expo the food from the window quickly."}
{"text":"been to this place twice and i'm a fan.  the first time i had the mac and cheese and wedge salad.  both were good.  i didn't care for the dressing on the wedge so when i was there the second time i asked for the \"blu cheese\" dressing and liked it much better.  the best restaurant in the airport.  will be back."}
{"text":"Decent prices, friendly service and nice ambience. Breakfast is served till 10:30am and they also have a fast order/pickup lane where fruit, baked goods and drinks are sold."}
{"text":"I would like to preface this review by stating I understand airport locations are never as good as their original. With that said, the Zinc airport location appears to strive for a lower bar then most. It started with the greeting, we walked up and hostess greeted us with a \"you're going to have to wait a minute.\"  No hello or welcome, just instructions to wait (not to mention the fact the restaurant was half empty). We figured, this is what comes with an airport location so no big deal but the greeting really set the tone for our terrible experience. The service level was consistently bad, highlighted by two exceptionally awful events. The first was when our food was dropped off.  It was literally dropped off. No opportunity to ask for anything else or anything. As soon as we had our food, we realized we needed a knife, but our waitress took off and was not to be found. We asked another waitress who said said she would get one. She didn't. Finally, our waitress came back and upon request, she promptly went to a dirty table next to us to get us knives. Disgusting. By this time we had realized our fries were cold which leads me to the second terrible event...

We asked the waitress for new fries, which she was quick to agree to. After about 15 minutes, a reminder that we were still waiting for our fries, and watching the manager yell at another waitress right in front of is, we finally got our fries. The fries redo literally took longer then our food originally took. Look, the point of the airport locations is to provide a good introduction to local restaurants for travelers, but the Zjnc location is doing the opposite. I have wanted to try the Scottsdale location for years, but after my experience at the airport I'm not sure I ever want to go back. The food was pretty good (albeit cold), but the service was so bad I don't have any desire to try a Zinc product at this point."}
{"text":"Best Burger I have had in a while, little pricey but then you are in an airport! I will be definitely stop by next time am flying out of Phoenix"}
{"text":"The food was actually decent for it being served in an airport. I ordered the burger which came with fries and a beer. 8/10. Now the bad: only two TVs in the entire place and they had the golf channel on during the playoffs. When I asked for them to change it, you would've thought I needed an act of congress. The server was rude, the manager was rude and they lied saying someone was watching it. Finally it changed when I practically begged them to ask the patrons (no one said they were watching it and most agreed with me). It was uncomfortably unnecessary."}
{"text":"Totally rude staff. It's 9-11 and Hurricane Irma. Asked if one of the TVs could be news instead of ESPN. Bartender said no we're watching sports. Walked out. Never go back."}
{"text":"PHX Terminal 4, gate C11. 
Favorites: burger, chicken paillard, pork belly baguette.
Fries are skinny, seasoned, good!
Table service is consistent."}
{"text":"Excellent Zinc Burger and fries!  The bacon blue cheese was a very tasty addition. The meat was cooked a perfect medium, as well. I really like the passion iced tea and the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Most expensive dreadful grab and go sandwich I've ever had.  $9 for a tuna Niçoise supposedly on baguette.  Soggy bread, NOT crispy baguette.

This sandwich shouldn't have been more than $3.50 it was so small and not good.

French Onion Soup TO GO was $15.  No side items.  WHAT?

Cup of sliced strawberries $6.50.  Outrageous.  Cashier defiant and not friendly. Don't recommend.  Try the other grab and go in the C gates."}
{"text":"I love flying out of Sky Harbor. This is the best Airport Food I've had. They pour the drinks by hand and don't skimp on the alcohol. The service is top notch and the food is always fresh. It's a must stop when at Sky Harbor. It's at the C-11 to C-19 concourse."}
{"text":"Just happened to pop in here before a flight to check out the menu. Decided to order the mac & cheese and it is to die for,  well not really but it is pretty freaking awesome. As I sat I looked  around at others food placed in front of them, I will say whoever puts the food together here definitely puts a lot of creativity into making sure that everything comes out looking spectacular. The bartender Donald, was very friendly, courteous,and knew the menu and everyone seems to be very customer service oriented, which is hard to find these days. Next time you are in terminal four C11-19 check this place out, you won't be disappointed. The"}
{"text":"During a 2+ hour layover in PHX, we were headed to La Madeleine to get soup for the wife when we saw the French Onion Soup on the menu here.  Since we can do \"La Mad\" back home, we said what the heck and stopped in to Zinc.

Now, as everyone knows, French Onion Soup is general served with a \"crouton\" on top, on which the cheese melts.  But if you're gluten free like the wife, they'll just melt the Gruyère cheese right on the top of the soup-filled crock.  Even though it would probably have been more fun to be able to have the cheese on toasted bread on top (poor wife), she was pleased with the soup.

And speaking of Gruyère...  The truffled Gruyère Zinc Burger was as amazing as it looked.  Five stars right there.

The dessert we chose was some sort of chocolate bread pudding/cake situation, with a side of ice cream with \"house made caramel sauce on top\".  Eh.... Fairly forgettable (we didn't finish it, even splitting it between the two of us... well, wife could only have the ice cream).  Maybe pastry isn't their strong suit.  

Overall, it's pricy because of the airport premium, and it's trying a bit too hard to be a \"bistro\" (which for some reason, makes people think they should charge 10% more).  And we didn't have to wait very long for our food, which is necessary in an airport.  I was pretty happy with my burger, \"frites\", and beer, and there were plugs available between the tables to top off the devices. 

3.86 stars.  Which for an airport dining stop, is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I will admit, I do not have high expectations for airport food, but I've had much better food at other airports restaurants. The pork belly baguette was mediocre. The pork belly was so overdone, tough and chewy. The fries came out lukewarm and were overly salted with a heavy hand on the paprika as well. No bueno. The service was at least quick and friendly, but I'd pass on the food. Maybe the drinks at the bar are better. :/"}
{"text":"We are so spoiled with the food options at Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor.  Seriously, we have some amazing eats.  After our shuttle dropped us off crazy early for our flight (we were through TSA with 2 hrs to our departure), we decided to grab breakfast and try something new.

I have a mixed review about Zinc.  While I loved the food, the portions were tiny and the price was $$$.  I ordered the Classic Breakfast ($13) which was 2 small eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, and a croissant the size of a baseball.  The kitchen was unable to poach eggs so I settled for over medium.  The Boy ordered The Zinc Omelet ($15.50) which was good, but again not worth the price.

The dining area was not open when we got there (bar seating only for the 1st hour) and the bartender was so so.  The Boy needed his golf fix and asked him to turn the TV to the Open.  The bartender was happy to oblige, but The Legend of Bagger Vance movie was on The Golf Channel instead of Open Coverage.  The Boy asked him again if he could change to the correct channel but the bartender didn't seem to care so we spent the rest of our time at the bar ignoring The Legend of Bagger Vance.

Before you jump all over me, I get it, it's the airport, stuff is going to be more expensive.  What you don't want is to pay $60 for breakfast and then go to another restaurant to order more food and drinks because you are still hungry, which is what we did."}
{"text":"I love this place, you don't feel like you're in an airport! I've only had breakfast here and I would recommend the Zinc croissant, add avocado. It's delicious. Also, always recommend their Bloody Mary's - they have great flavor and they will give you the pepper and tabasco to make it spicer. I would recommend this restaurant if you're at the C gates in Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"At least ONE vegetarian option other than an extremely basic salad would be nice. It's 2017 after all. Other than that, the service was extremely on point. Was never in the least bit concerned around getting in and out of here quickly with my short 35 minute layover."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised. Service was really good - ask for Tarry. We had champagne, Malbec and the fries. All were really good. Ordered a second round of all of it!"}
{"text":"I'm sick.
The guys at the bar made me the best hot toddy I e ever had. And. Now I feel a little better"}
{"text":"Expensive, but a great addition to the PHX Sky Harbor local business empire! The beer is deliciously cold, the onions on the ham & gruyere made the sandwich."}
{"text":"If you want a \"sit down\" meal before a Southwest flight out of Sky Harbor, Zinc Brasserie is your place. A French-inspired restaurant was not what I was expecting in Arizona. Not a cactus in sight, but we stepped on in as we were hungry and knew that peanuts and a soda on our flight would not be enough.

We just missed the breakfast hours. However, the lunch/dinner menu featured an omelet with French ham, gruyere cheese, and creme fraiche, plus potato straws. Perfect. A generous enough portion that DH and I were glad we shared. Along with coffee, the omelet was enough to tide us over until we arrived home.

Look forward to stopping here again in the future."}
{"text":"What a pleasant place to enjoy some food and a few drinks before our flight.   Food was fresh and the cocktails were creative and fun!  Parhom, our server was attentive and enjoyable.  Thanks again for the pen!  Looking forward to visiting Terminal 4 soon!"}
{"text":"Zinc Brasserie had a French ambiance, but it's bright with matching decor and a wall of windows. French music. English speaking staff. Bar drinks, food, gluten-free dessert and coffee books for reading pleasure. 

Anyways, the prices are great. Excellent menu with just enough choices. I couldn't resist the frites, but actually not hungry. So they packed me for the airplane. The chocolate brioche bread pudding was amazingly good. 

Loved it!

Besides Zinc Brasserie being in the airport, they advertise two other restaurants around Phonenix. I highly recommend them: alone or with others."}
{"text":"I ordered the omelet and coffee.  It was a  trifold, premade egg with gruyere cheese in the middle with stringy, crispy potatoes on top for garnish.  The egg tasted fake.  No toast.  Only took the edge off my hunger for $15.  Coffee delivered in a cracked cup, sent back and a dirty cup delivered.  $4 for coffee.  Awful.  I don't mind paying the price in the airport, but give me a meal, and make it real food."}
{"text":"Go here for over-priced bad food with a side of attitude. I love the Zinc Bistro at Scottsdale Quarter but the airport location is pretty bad. 

I ordered my steak frites medium but it came out practically raw. It was such a fatty piece of meat, I could barely cut it. I asked our waiter for two steak knives and he said, \"We're at an airport.\" Well, that makes sense but there are more polite ways to respond, such as, \"Unfortunately, I can't give any steak knives because we're at the airport and sharp knives aren't allowed.\" We told him the steak was not a very good cut and he just stared at us blankly.

Over-dressed salad. Boring fries (which is crazy because their fries are DELISH at the Quarter). Even the burger was bland and dry. 

Would I recommend Zinc? Yes! At Scottsdale Quarter. There are better options at Phoenix Sky Harbor, though."}
{"text":"The French onion soup is a very small cup for $15.50. This is pretty abusive even for expensive airport dining."}
{"text":"Where to start. Poor service. Aloof wait staff. Poorly cooked food. Our waiter poured water on a companion's lap without an apology. My burger was order medium well and it came out medium rare at best. By the time we could flag down the waiter and get a replacement I literally had 5 min before we had to leave for a flight. The food is extremely over priced and staff were rude. Will never go there again even with over an hour before a flight."}
{"text":"The ham and cheese baguette was not very good. I came in for the Mac and cheese because someone here recommended it. Don't make the same mistake I made. The bartender was nice and on her game, friendly and kind."}
{"text":"Overpriced place, wine way to exspensive and the order of fries are small as hell! Only come here cause you have no choice at this gate! LOL. They get me evrytime."}
{"text":"Great place in C concourse for a quick bite between flights. Very spiffy decor and professional servers/bartenders. Full selection of bar drinks are available. 

We were here in the breakfast hour (hmmm, reminds me of a song from the Rascals in '67) so I chose the Zinc Croissant and my wife selected the Zinc Omelette. Both were large as in is someone coming by to help me eat this?

The lightly grille croissant was hidden by scrambled eggs, large strips of bacon, and the Godzilla of tomato slices. I hung tough and ate all of it. My wife's omelette was likewise large and had big chunks of ham in it with creamy fromage. She loved it!  I was forced to take a bite for QC reasons and I concur. 

Stop in when in Phoenix Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"The five stars are remembering that this is an AIRPORT RESTAURANT.

Man, what is there not to love. I was having a stressful trip and the last thing I wanted was another soggy pizza from Sbarro or a food-court burrito that rips apart as soon as you unwrap the foil.

This little French bistro had a relaxing ambiance. They had a great selection of food that you don't see at airports (as in, you can actually find new dishes to try that you haven't had before). And the food is good! Its relatively decently priced. I mean its expensive, but considering its in an airport...

The service was great and quick (important during a layover).

Maybe not quite 5 stars in the real world simply due to price but awesome for an airport."}
{"text":"If you are on your way out of town this is the place in Terminal C to eat! The staff is amazing. The bartender Tim remembered everyone's name, was very helpful, and pleasant to say the least. He recommended the Ice Berg salad with chicken; so delicious! Next vacation I will be stopping by for sure!"}
{"text":"My review is grumpy for the air port or the restaurant not sure. 


What the what $15.5 for iceberg. 
Grr airline or airport or bin Ladin, these prices are insane. 
The French onion soup in the earlier photos is either \"touched up\" or they've changed the bowl to a thimble. it's also $15.5.
