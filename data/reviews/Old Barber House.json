{"text":"Not sure why all the negative reviews this place is amazing. I went to this Restaurant over the holidays, absolutely loved it. I went with a large group, company party. They gave us a private room for 25 people. The service and food was amazing,  Our waiter even pulled our my chair for me to sit down, I ordered a steak it was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor. I highly recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"I have to agree with other reviewers, this place gives the illusion of something great but fails horribly to deliver on that.  Atmosphere is quite elegant but the food is just bland for the price and this type of establishment."}
{"text":"Unlike some of the other reviews out there, I actually had a pretty positive experience. Based on what I'd read, I was expecting food that did not taste as good as the price would suggest.  However, I was pleasantly surprised. I had the veal, which was quite delicious, tender, and the sauce was a great complement. My companion had pork chops and thought the sauce was  bit too tart.  As for the rest, the decor was classic but a little spartan. The service was polite and attentive, but not effusive. No particular complaints. The price was a little expensive, but for a main course was not exorbitantly expensive ($38).  I suppose I went with low expectations and had them challenged - I would go back, and would recommend to others as well who are looking for a slightly higher end experience."}
{"text":"The decor is charming, that's the only positive thing I can say about my experience here.   The food is grossly over priced for food that is... just plain gross. The pasta sauces were bland to say the least, and the meat and vegetables were overcooked. The staff were inattentive and to top it off, I had originally made a reservation, but when I attempted to make a change to it they wound up cancelling it altogether \"by accident\". Luckily, the restaurant was empty - this does not come as a surprise.   Do not waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"My now wife Sarah and I found Old Barber House in December of 2014. After trying it out for an impromptu dinner, we immediately booked the Elizabeth room for our June 2015 wedding.  During our initial visit, we tried the Fillet Minion and the Prosciutto Wrapped Chicken Supreme. While the fillet was delicious and perfectly cooked, the chicken was so juicy and delicious that it easily took the crown. Also, if you're a fan of Brie, the Niagara Double Cream Brie is to-die-for, and the portion is huge.  We had a fairly small wedding, 25 guests, so we chose the Joseph menu which was absolutely delicious. Everyone of our guests had more-than-enough food but also, they couldn't stop raving about how good the food was; this was unexpected as we had some picky eaters in the group :)  I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews here about the food, but we have absolutely no complaints at all. Furthermore, the price that we agreed upon back in December was the price that we paid the day of the wedding in June.  We are very happy to give Old Barber House a rave review here and hope to see many more. Also, we look forward to making Old Barber House one of our regulars."}
{"text":"Giving it a 3 today is out of pitty. I've been here so many times in the last two decades. What the heck happened? This place was on the top of its game.  You didnt mind paying a premium for what they had to offer.  The ambiance was nice and the food was enough to make any critic reach new heights in food euphoria.   That was then,  but now they have the decore, and the food is lacking. I was disappointed on my last visit. A word to the managment, you have lost your way.   I hope you find it again. Next time i go there may be my last if you dont get it together  I have very high expectations for you. I remember a time when i would have given you a 7 on a scale of 1 to 5 and now this 3 is out of mercy because you really deserve a 2. You would be a prime candidate for that food network show Restaurant Impossible, where Robert Irvine comes in and sets your path straight once again.   Get it together before its too late. I would love to come back and give you the 5 stars you once deserved.  I have high hopes."}
{"text":"Definitely a pricier restaurant compared to some other places - it was nice that they maintained the house as tribute to the historical owner of it back in the early era of the Streetsville days.   Shame that it is closed down now for the residential building and zoning instead but I suppose it was good while it lasted.   Albeit it was pricier than other restaurants so I would feel that I wouldn't have come often anywho."}
{"text":"I've been to this place on several occasions and have always experienced good service. The food is quite good (better than The Keg) and the quality of service is also better than The Keg. Definitely would recommend this place for a more intimate dining experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I and another couple went to the Old Barber House for a special Christmas get together on December 11, 2011. My wife and I have been going there for at least 25 years. It was always one of those places that you kept for special occasions. The century home charm, big classic furniture, fire places throughout, waiters in tuxedos. After all these years it still has that....  Unfortunately that is where the \"special\" ended. Our waiter - a young guy around 25, was nice and attentive - but it just wasn't the same. I was looking for the older professional waiters. Not his fault, just not what I considered suitable for the type of Establishment the Barber House tries to portray.  The real disappointment was the food. It was nothing special. The Steak and Shrimp at $38 was \"okay\" - but not worth the money. I could have got a better steak from a chain restaurant. The display was basic and the vegetables overcooked. My friend had the wild boar \"special\" - she was unable to eat 70% of it as it was fat and gristle. And there was nothing particularly tasty about the part she was able to eat. Even after the waiter was told how disappointing the boar was, there was no effort to compensate for it.  I'm sorry to see the old place heading down this road. We won't be going back"}
{"text":"The steak was actually really good and cooked right to order...but the sides you get with it are kind of a joke for the price you pay. The cream of broccoli soup is puree and cheap. The dessert was okay. The pasta is virtually inedible. The salad was plain. Not sure where your money goes at this restaurant. The server was really great and really nice...deserved to be working somewhere less pretentious. Overall the experience was good, but the price was psychotic for the quality of food that you receive."}
{"text":"Wasn't worth how much you pay. Also, I had the salmon and it wasn't cooked properly and had stomach issues for the last 3 days! The waiter was new and he was actually really good. Too bad the restaurant wasn't up to par with the waiters service. The place also needs a bit of a makeover because it seems very outdated."}
{"text":"I've been here twice; and one thing I can say is order the Oysters Rockefeller. The second time I came, I ordered the lobster special. Considering the prices they charge, it wasn't that great. If you charge big prices for your food then you had better make sure the food is outstanding. The atmosphere is great- but make sure you're not the only person there because then it gets a little awkward. No one wants a waiter hanging over their shoulder for an hour and a half. I get the impression this place has trouble getting customers some nights because of the prices- the food really leaves something to be desired, but it is a beautiful house and a great place to sit down and have a formal, family sort of meal."}
{"text":"I organized a group event and had an awful experience. A staff member gave me a tour a month before the event. We reserved a date, confirmed the type of function, the range of people we can expect and the associated price. We confirmed this again weeks before the event. TWO DAYS before the event, they told us the price was significantly higher than originally discussed and the room we wanted would not be available to us. When we showed up, they had cancelled our reservation entirely. The event was stressful and the staff did not take accountability. The final price was negotiated to a middle number, but was still higher than what was originally offered.  The food was below average - and we received comments on this from our guests."}
