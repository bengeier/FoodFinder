{"text":"Super delicious! Everything is perfectly made and fulfills all cravings for fast food."}
{"text":"I've scarfed down my fair share of currywursts in both Hamburg and Berlin, and I have to say that the Fry Haus is better than most. A bit spicy (which I like), but extremely tasty and saucy. The fries were killer as well, and the price was exactly right. This is going to be one of my regular spots. If you've never had a currywurst, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Oh my God I love this place!! For the price the best chicken schnitzel sandwich around. Today I ordered the homemade burger and it was amazing- remember back in the day when you use to order a hamburger and it actually looked like meat,homemade burger at this place awesome same thing, would definitely recommend this place, I usually call in advance and pick up my order because they are really busy at lunch - so you will have to wait if you are a walk in. It's a takeout place so standing room only for your order worth the wait people!!! Going to order wings next time can't wait. :) I ordered a chicken schnitzel sandwich and a  cheese hamburger and it cost me $13."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their currywurst, which is virtually impossible to find in this town.
The set up isn't ideal for dealing with rushes, I've had a couple of really long waits when there are more than one or two other people ordering. 
Also, the schnitzel is fine but in my opinion can't cut it for either quality or price value compared to Schnitzel Queen which is just a few blocks south on Queen at Sherbourne.
I do really enjoy their sides, however. Particularly great coleslaw and potato salad"}
{"text":"I had a chicken schnitzel sandwich here and loved it. They have a great selection of toppings and the price is right. I only wish there was some seating available."}
{"text":"Really good food at extremely reasonable prices. Our faves - any schnitzel sandwich at $5/each, chicken wings (would reco getting 2 orders) $5/each and the potato salad $3 small / $5 large (which are 2 smalls - generous amount)."}
{"text":"Had a chance to make my second visit to the Fry Haus and just as the first time it did not disappoint.  I ordered the fish Schnitzel on a burger bun and it was delicious! The breading was crunchy and light and the topping selection was abundant. Also, try the fries, i cannot explain how awesome the seasoning is on them! 

What I really like about this place is they they make every thing fresh to order and they have a great selection of home made sauces! The staff that works there is really friendly giving it a good local business feel.

I look forward to getting back there for another bite!"}
{"text":"SOLID food. I got the frankfurter wiener and the fritten mischmach which is basically just poutine and I was impressed. The poutine was a good size and the cheese was all gooey and melty which I feel I never see anymore. The hot dog was a good portion too. I didn't go inside but my friend said that she was watching the cooks make the food and it all looked really good. Great take-out spot, would def recommend."}
{"text":"Update time!

Chicken Schnitzel is $6 and Veal Schnitzel is $7, so a slight price increase but still a perfectly reasonable price for the deliciousness that is their sandwiches. They've also  streamlined the menu a bit by the looks of things but the food is all still great. They got rid of their cheese spread, but get the \"burger sauce\" on anything sandwich based. It's like Big Mac sauce which blends beautifully with their other sauces (especially the 5 Pepper Ranch).

I'd dare say that I've even started to enjoy the veal sandwich here more than California Sandwiches. Mind you the sandwiches are really not trying to do the same thing, but every time I've eaten Fry Haus I've been super satisfied, which has not been the case as CS continues to grow and lose their small business touch. So food for thought.

Everything else from my original review pretty much stands true."}
{"text":"First time going to this little gem.  Tried the Veal Schnitzel sandwich which was amazing!  Perfectly seasoned, nice crispy breading and cooked just right.  Hot sauce has a nice kick.  Spicy apple spread gives a nice sweet contrast.  Would definitely find myself back here, again!"}
