{"text":"Well located cafe about 10 mins walk east from the eaton center on dundas and sherbourne for some of the lowest priced all day homestyle breakfast/lunch combos in downtown Toronto.   They have a couple of different blends of in-house coffee and over 500 different kinds of Tea! It has a nice and relaxed atmosphere you would expect from a cafe.  The staff are really nice and will probably remember your name after a few visits, if not  sooner and in addition to this, remember exactly how you like your drinks and food. There are also always a few snacks around to and the home cooked banana bread tastes good.  There is also a couple of simple computers with the internet, a tv and I have even seen some creative people bring in some of their work to trade or talk over coffee. The steady stream of regulars shows (but not overcrowded) how much people like the place and if you want to support a local business, this is the best way to go! I have seen couples come here for a date, but you'd expect that with the cafe theme :)  It's also conveniently located right next to Avola College hair dressing school, if you need a really cheap hair cut and during the day when the cafe is open the area is usually pretty calm.  I am giving this place 5 stars because of the great customer service and value for money."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food and the coffee was decent! Staff were lovely to chat with. Will definitely come back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The most unique place in Toronto! I love this place because it's chill, affordable, no frills, and unique.  There are a gazillion boxes of teas.  You pick one and they add lychee and flowers to make it a nice ice tea-all for $1.50! The owners are also lovely people. They are truly giving and caring-and they deserve the best! They should host Lesbian and LGBT events. Their bathrooms are a bit scary as if the place used to be a club or a bar.  Music on Saturdays.  Did I say the people here are really nice? They are-enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Has awesome pie and cappacinos, it is sort of a dive but has an amazing homey vibe where it feels like everyone knows everyone."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to check this place out and finally made it in today. I loved my breakfast . The bacon was so amazing. And the homefries we're just the right amount of crunch. I will definitely be back here. I'm going to grab some extra homefries next time for sure... the place is actually really cute inside . I'm a sucker for antiques and just love the atmosphere in the place it was absolutely phemoninal .  Will have to come back."}
{"text":"Nice place in a funny neighbourhood. Walked in there for an afternoon breakfast. He made my day. Good breakfast for no money and a nice talk for free with it. Don't expect fancy kitchen here. It is what it is (just like I love it). Gonna come back here for pancakes and more soon. Oh, and you have an incredible choice of tea. Cheers Jeroen"}
{"text":"If you're talking about experience, it's somewhat like a glorified homeless shelter. It's frequented by area regulars who just want a safe place to watch TV and have a coffee - which admittedly makes the atmosphere quite depressing.  But regardless, there's a kitschy charm this place has. Keith Haring art, chalkboard menu, Old Windows 95 computers to go on, and free Wi-Fi. Somewhat dilapidated and musty. It's fashioned like somewhat of a castle.   Had their signature pan-fried juicy sexy burger, which was quite a tower. Meat is thick - although I wouldn't say it's worlds above a simple burger you'd assemble at home. The value is alright, but you will find better in the area.  They also host acoustic nights every week and have a large tea selection. One of the few \"safe\" places the Dundas & Sherbourne area has. Prices seem to be average for this area (and it definitely can't be considered cheap for what you get), but certainly walk down to central Dundas for some real food."}
{"text":"This is the only cafe in the sketchiest part of the downtown core.  I used to live in this area and got to know John and Lina (sp? crap!) very well.  They are brother and sister and work very hard.  I like to stop by from time to time just to say hello because they are such nice, wonderful people.  Honestly, they have to put up with a lot of crazy folk.  A LOT.  This isn't the type of place I would go to just to check it out, because of the shady neighbourhood and messed up people. HOWEVER, if you happen to live in this area you have to check out the place.  They have a really mean burger and delicious spaghetti and meatballs, among other things.  They also have free computers and internet use for customers."}
