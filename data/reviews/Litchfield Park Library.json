{"text":"Small library but decent for an occasional visit. Loved the free Music class they had for baby. They controlled the attendance with a sign up. However, the wild life world zoo one was crazy. There was no sign up and they crammed everyone in there. About 50+ people in a small room. I'm pretty sure it was against fire code because it was way over capacity. Not a smart move! I found the goodyear library and it fits my needs better, but I won't pass up a free class so like I said, decent for occasional visit."}
{"text":"I've been going there since high school I honestly love this library. it is a small one but you can reserve whatever you need. I think I like the small atmosphere and the fact that i go in and out pretty fast and do not get bothered by a million different people"}
{"text":"Oh how I wish there was a better library close by.  This place is tiny and the parking lot is horrible!  The closest library to me that has tables you can work at and study at is 30 minutes or more away.  Most of the time, I have to request a book from another library to be sent over because their selection is so small.  Please Goodyear, hurry up and finish building yours!!"}
