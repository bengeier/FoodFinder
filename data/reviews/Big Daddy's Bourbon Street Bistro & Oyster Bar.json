{"text":"Love! Love! Love this place! The food is amazing, everything I've tried on the menu so far was absolutely delicious. The restaurant is warm and inviting and so are the servers. The plates are a great portion and price point is affordable. Must visit at least once!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for anything cajun and a bigger sucker for seafood.  Came on Friday with a few friends and ordered the $31 prix fixe (They also have a $26 one, but the main course options are as great).   Our choices: Apps -  PEI Mussels, Seafood Gumbo  PEI Mussels were fantastic and came with a side of garlic bread. The sauce that was coating them was garlic-y and tomato-y perfection. It was a huge portion as well. My friends also really enjoyed the seafood gumbo.   Mains - Tipsy Shrimp Pasta, Bronzed Fish of the Day (Salmon), Jambalaya on Rice.   We all didn't finish our mains and ended up taking most of it home (Yay next-day lunch!). Tipsy shrimp pasta was cooked aldente but the tomato-basil sauce was just mediocre at best. The bacon-wrapped-jumbo-shrimp was the BEST. The jalepeno on the bacon just gave the already perfect shrimp an extra kick. Bronzed fish was perfectly cooked and had great crispy skin. I also heard the Jamalaya was fantastic as well.   Desserts - Creme Brulee, Bourbon Street Bread Pudding We were really disappointed with the Creme Brulee. The sugar top was way too thick so it was still in sugar crystals and had an awful texture. Also, the whole thing was not set, so it ended up being too soft and a little liquidy. The only plus side of it was the big portion they gave you. The Bread Pudding on the other-hand was fantastic. It was just warm enough to compliment the ice cream and the texture and flavors were great.   Others - Oysters, Fried Alligator  My friends ordered some additional apps. (During the afternoon they have \"Voodoo Hours\" which means all bar apps are 2$ off). The sauce for the alligator was delicious and really made the dish. My friend also loved the oysters (especially with all the different cocktail sauces they offer).   Service - was HORRIBLE.  We had to sit in the bar area because the dining room was full. We never got our water refilled and ended up drinking each others out of desperation. The bartenders never came by and we had to wait forever for both the food and the bill. They also started to clear plates before all of us finished eating. minus 1 star.   Overall, great food with horrible service. Definitely coming back again for the good food; I just won't sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Visited Big Daddy's for dinner tonight and I originally wanted the crabfish broil, as advised on Yelp, I asked if they had it but they didn't so I was opted to choose something else. So I ordered the oyster po boy appetizer and Big Daddy's Mixed Platter as the main course. With a price of $35 i was severely underwhelmed by the size of the plate I received. Your standard dinner plate side, the half lobster was smaller than expected and the fish was lacking in flavour, there were only 2 scallops, and 3 fried shrimps with a side of cauliflower and carrots. The Po boy appetizer was pretty good but overall the entire experience was a bit lacking. There was barely anyone in the restaurant yet our server was still slow at times. We also couldn't sit in the dining area because it was closed...   Service 3/5 Taste 3/5 Value 2.5/5"}
{"text":"I recently had dinner with my family at Big Daddy's for my sister's birthday and I must say, this place really surprised me. The decor didn't give me much expectation but most of the food we ordered was pretty good. I ordered a bunch of appetizers such as the crispy calamari (DELICIOUS), PEI mussels (average), coconut shrimp (very yummy), shrimp cocktail (only received 3 pieces of shrimp!) and of course OYSTERS! The Japanese oysters are by far my favorite as they have a crisp texture to it. They come with 6 different sauces but the oysters alone were just as good. If you go to Big Daddy's, you also must try their FONDUE especially if you love cheese. It's enough to share between two people for an appetizer, and trust me; you'll want it all for yourself. It's served hot with small pieces of toast. As for the main entrees, i found them ok compared to the appetizers (seafood fettuccini, seafood platter and crab cakes) but nothing special. The desserts that came with the set menu we ordered from were VERY sweet (brownies and bread pudding) - too sweet for my liking actually. For service i think it was AMAZING as we had gotten a very attentive waitress so nothing to really complain about. Overall, this place was a pretty good experience for us."}
{"text":"Big Daddy's is a King Street staple. The patio in the summer time is a nice place to dine and people watch. The creole-inspired menu has whatever you are looking for. I have been here on a few occasions. Like others, the food at times has been a hit or miss. I have enjoyed the blackened catfish, grilled calamari and mussels. The jambalaya is stuffed with fish, shrimp and mussels. On my last visit, I had a bowl of spicy gumbo, which was quite runny and bland. It was expecting a hearty soup with a punch. It was not meant to be that day.   The dessert selection here is plenty, The bread pudding and pecan tart are delectable.  With the prixe fix menu, you can definitely get a taste of Big Daddy's without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I love Big Daddies and have given them 5 stars despite the fact that they don't play Cajun music (come on guys, please play it once in a while!) I've taken many people to Big Daddy's for dinner and to share apps.   The Oysters are a great starter and come with an assortment of hot sauces. The Voodoo Hours are a great way to try a few things if you have a couple of people and don't want to commit to a full menu item. The servers are always very nice, professional & knowledgeable.  **Pop by for a nibble and a drink before the theatre, the service pretty is quick**"}
{"text":"I am not really a big seafood fan but I have been to Big Daddy's Crabshack about 3 - 4 times, mostly for lunch and once for dinner.  For a seafood place they have lots of selection, they have something for the casual seafood fan (like me) and something for those who really love seafood (my date).  I am kind of a appetizer addict - in that sometimes i;ll order a couple of appetizers and call it a night.  That being said, this place has some really tasty appetizers and recommend basically everything lol.  This place gives you good value for your money - you know your going to get high quality food at nice portions and of course the service is friendly.  Only thing that kind of bothers me, is that the lighting isn't that great, makes it feel glum - i dont know maybe its just me.  So for all you seafood lovers take a trip to Big Daddys."}
{"text":"I was here with couple of friends on Feb. 12. Tried Chef's Choice oyster platter 12 oysters for $24. Oysters were very fresh and the choices were all great. Staff are friendly, nice and helpful. Really like this place. I will definitely be back here again for some after work fresh oysters and beer."}
{"text":"Food is good  Oysters are quite decent and their fixed price menu is a very good deal We had oysters, mussels, grilled fish , and seafood salad  The service was outstanding for a crowded Friday night  Their manager came to apologize for the delay for our reservation  and the server really tried hard even though she was running then so many tables  Definitey a place to go back"}
{"text":"Good oysters ( not as great a selection as oyster boys but better than most) , jalapeño corn bread bruschetta also a must have. Pair w oyster bay white wine   Fun atmosphere but keep in mind most of their dishes are very small so if ur starving prepare to spend"}
{"text":"Great decor, great music, great service, good food. Their food isn't heavily seasoned, and there was nothing I hated, but I'd say that I would have liked more oomph (more seasoning, more spice, more heat) in their southern menu items, like the voodoo pork or the jambalaya. I mean, where is the character in the food?! Is it because they want to appeal to the masses, so they toned it down? Their cocktails are also very weak.  Overall though, I had a great time. The place is really well-decorated!!! Servers are smiling and attentive, Music is not too loud and it's always good music. Food is prepared with care and it tastes good, but like I said, I was expecting a little more character."}
{"text":"Great location, great service, but the lunch was very very mediocre.  The tuna tacos were so messy and inside a tonn of sour cream there is a small small bit of seared tuna ...  way too messy to be on a lunch menu in the middle of tourist/business section.  My friend had the lobster grill cheese, we needed a magnifying glass to find the bits of lobster, maybe they just waved some lobster over it?   The food tasted good, but very disappointing as it did not reflect what the menu said it was."}
{"text":"I immensely enjoy their Monday Mussels and Pint deal, and have come here about 3 times for this now. Also came here with another couple for a double date and we had a great time then as well. I like any place that shows me an atmosphere of another place or culture and Big Daddy's does this well, with their decor and music.  I do not recommend ordering their chowder however, which tastes just like when I made chowder from Cream of Mushroom soup in university."}
{"text":"Food really sucks. Went there for my bday, got the Prix Fixe menu & didnt eat my main course or even bother for the dessert. Save yourself & go to Caballito next door or Canteen down the road for a good meal worth the $$$  Appetizer - mussels: not fresh, cold Entree - bacon wrapped shrimp with pasta: the shrimp was rubbery, the bacon was soggy & not crisp, the pasta was so old & dry, cold, almost no sauce... im sure that bowl was sitting in the fridge & they just popped it in the microwave on high for 2mins.  My friend got the duck salad... isnt duck supposed to look like pieces of grilled meat? this looked like something from a can or a jar, waxy, plastic texture, no meaty, fibrous."}
{"text":"Came here a few years ago during Winterlicious. At the time it was very good and I always thought about going back since. Had a chance to do just that last week. This place has gone hill big time. The service was good but the food was very average, very mediocre. I felt like I was at Appleby's.  You want some seafood? Spend a couple of extra bucks and go across the street to Rodney's."}
{"text":"For the food. This is a must go place. I gotta say, I felt like the south was really there. U fortunately, the service was poor. I had to wait 15 mins even before being asked for a drink. And food came after 30mins from then. My friend though said he had better service here. So I'm just hoping this was just a one time thing. The food, Mmmmm. The jambalaya was delicious, you can slightly taste the chilli powder which I found slightly off. The shellfish boil. Pure. Simple. Delicous! I would also recommend getting the ribs for apps cause that sauce just gives ur mouth a different sensation. If your a ribber, get the entree.lol"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm an Oyster lover and I've been searching for the right Oyster place for a while until accidently stumbled on Big Daddy.  The Oysters here have always been fresh!  They have about 6 or 7 different kind of Oysters to choose from.  I only go here for the Oysters and drinks.  The food here is not the best as well as the staff.  The staff are soooo slow and that that friendly but the Oysters are Grrreat!"}
{"text":"Interesting choice to go from the states to Canada ... to have Cajun cuisine but Big Daddy's was within walking distance from the hotel and and since it was past 10:30pm on a weeknight, we weren't too terribly fussed.  I'd say everything was just ok here, including the BBQ pork back ribs, the popcorn shrimp and the raw oysters.  The oyster po boy had a strong fishiness to it that didn't appeal to me.    Sitting outside on a summer night was the highlight.  Almost perfect weather, low humidity and with a thin jacket that you don't really need but like to carry around.  Service was friendly although a bit slow at times."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but each time it seems like it gets worse. But it doesn't get worse than being average. So not bad.  What I really like is their coconut shrimp and their catfish dish. Their clam chowder is a hit and miss."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Delicious food. Great portions. Super filling.   Seafood fondue was my favourite , will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"If anyone knows Big Daddy personally, could you tell him Happy Hour called and said it isn't as happy as it used to be?  First of all, I feel bad for all the other reviewers who have not discovered the wonders of their Happy Hour (aka the now Voodoo Hour) menu. Why would you go here for the regular dinner menu? The share plates are much more fun and worth it for your money! With that said, the long time patrons of Big Daddy's, like myself, will know that the Happy Hour menus used to be a much better deal, with more items to choose from! The current deal is $2 off all the share items during Voodoo hours (check the website for specifics).  I first discovered this place maybe 3 years ago for my then-boyfriend's birthday. We loved it then and it became a regular outing for us - it deserved a 5 Stars then, IMO. Then the Happy Hour prices started going up and things started changing. I stayed away for a while.  I decided to give it another try recently when I was in the mood for some oysters. I was happy to see they had renovated to allow more seating in the bar/lounge area (a BIG plus!!) and took off most of the strange sketchy decor from before (another big plus!!!). The atmosphere is average - but usually I just focus on my oysters and don't look around the place. Service is alright but the kitchen is slow.  Oysters were still good. Their range of house-made sauces always amuse the first-timers. Happy to see the SEAFOOD FONDUE was still on the menu! This is one of their MUST MUST MUST TRY items. Warning: it is fricking delicious, but dangerously rich; so don't have it for yourself alone. Sharing is caring. Their Calamari and chowder are also good. I would advise to stay away from some of their fried stuff, they're pretty average (e.g. Gator Bites). Another warning: you may have the tendency to over-order because of the additional $2 off of every plate, but trust me, you'll explode.  Would go back, but I am not their #1 groupie like I once was. *tear  atmosphere - 2/5 food - 3.5/5 service - 3/5 price - 4/5  PS - Haven't tried it lately, but if you are going for the regular menu, give the Jambalaya a try - it was once my favourite pasta ever."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my girlfriend and had an absolutely amazing time. The food was spot on, everything we ordered was tasty, filling and looked lovely.  Our waiter was amazing!"}
{"text":"Big love for Big Daddy's Bourbon Street Bistro & Oyster Bar. Creole fish and chips was average tasting but there's big love for the popcorn shrimp, jalapeño cornbread and most of all, big love for the service. Looking forward to my return."}
{"text":"This just became my favorite seafood restaurant in the city. Amazing service, stellar food quality and great atmosphere made for a very lovely dinner. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had the prix fixed menu. We starred with the calamari and gumbo. They were both very flavorful and a decent serving. We had jumbo shrimp with creole rice and seafood pasta in Creole sauce for our entrees. The pasta was mediocre but the shrimps were very good. The dessert was pecan pie a la mode and bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and brandy sauce. The only dessert made in house was the bread pudding and it wasn't the greatest. Overall it was a good experience the atmosphere was great and our waitress Julie was really nice."}
{"text":"Just finished our meal at Daddy's. Great oysters! Our choice if scallops and crab cakes were a good introduction to creole food if lacking in a touch of distinct flavour. My partners blackened catfish and rice flavoured with jalapeños was an excellent choice. My mixed seafood platter was naff. The lobster was obviously frozen and broiled with no pleasant flavour or texture. It was stuck to shell. The shrimp were not broiled to a delicate texture or flavour - they were gnarly and dried out. The scallops were fine and the blackened catfish and mixed veg were great. The service was super and the ambiance pleasant. Just a thought, if you go to a hands in meal of fish, then surely your hands should smell a little of the food? Fresh in Florida is still the best"}
{"text":"Closing July 19 - visit soon if you love this place too:  THANKS FOR EVERYTHING! Dear guests,  We want to thank you for your loyal patronage over the years and let you know that as of July 19th 2015, Big Daddy's will be closing for renovations.  We will reopen in early September as Lone Star Texas Grill! We'll be serving up the big bold tastes of Texas in every dish - be sure to try our authentic, award-winning fajitas!  Leading up to July 19th, our hour of operations will be as follows:  Sunday - Wednesday 11:30 am to 10:00 pm Thursday - Saturday 11:30 am to midnight"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Toronto! Love the food here and the staff is always so very nice. Come here often and always to celebrate my birthday and introduce more friends to this place. Love the oysters and the jambalaya!  Really miss the cornbread bruschetta, hopping they add it back to the menu. Creme brûlée here is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've always gone for the Bourbon Street Bites and drinks in the bar area. It is ideal to go with a group of friends because you can taste a bit of everything, but it's also a great place to go for a date. The food is really delicious! The seafood fondue has to be my favourite dish - it's their signature appetizer. It's served hot, creamy, cheesy with pieces of seafood and it is fun to dip into with the toasted pieces of baguette that come with it. The oysters are also amazing - fresh and juicy and come with a whole array of sauces to slurp up which is great for all you sauce lovers out there.   I've never had a bad dish at this place! Great food, great service - definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"The scene: a whirlwind, 36-hour visit to Toronto. 3G is disabled to prevent astronomical roaming charges, and the hotel charges $15/day for wireless.  We are lost, hungry, and Yelpless, and it's getting late.  We accost a stranger and ask, \"where is good food?\"  He wraps a protective arm around his girlfriend points in the general direction of King Street before hurrying away.  We walk a few blocks south and turn down a dark stairwell.  We find Big Daddy's Crabshack and Oyster Bar.  She does not get eaten by the eels at this time.  What I mean to say is, the story gets less scary from here.  I'm explaining to you because you look nervous.  We walked in to what looked like a cross between an Irish pub and classy cocktail bar.  Dark wood everything, but with a certain elegance.  Our friendly waitress informed us that we were beginning \"Voodoo hours\" (10pm to midnight in this particular location, if I recall), which meant that all of their small plates were $2 off.  This meant 4 oysters (with fixins') could be had for a mere $5.   Now, you may recall that we were Yelpless, so we were a little hesitant about ordering discount raw seafood.  But you may also recall that we were very hungry as well.  Raw oysters it was.  And seafood fondue after that, and coconut chicken tenders after that.  The oysters were fresh and delicious.  The seafood fondue was flavorful, large, and chock-full of fresh seafood.  The coconut chicken tenders were overcooked, greasy, and boring.  2 out of 3 ain't bad, but stick with the \"surf\" if you visit.  We left full and happy.  The end."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Big Daddy's Cuisine: Seafood Location: Entertainment District Address: 212 King St W Price Range: $15~  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Southern/Soul * Specializes in seafood * Patio during summer * Closed for lunch on Sat/Sun * Open late on Thurs/Fri/Sat  Anywhere there are oysters, I am in. Anywhere there are specials, I am in. Big Daddy's Bourbon St Bistro has been on my 'go to' list for awhile. Also ever since I saw on my friend's twitter feed about their seafood fondue and oysters, I knew I had to check it out.  If you know me well enough, you know I like to do some research on the restaurant before my visit (like any other food blogger). Well thanks to my sometimes not-so-healthy obession with eating, I found out that if you sign up for their newsletter online- they give you a free appetizer! So I signed up and they sent me an email with necessary information for my free appetizer. I gotta admit this post is a little outdated but this free appetizer deal is still valid.  My friend and I dropped by for dinner on a friday and we found the restaurant pretty much packed. We waited for about 10 minutes or so before we were seated in a corner booth.  Ordered: Chef's Choice Oysters 5/5  * Dozen chef selected oysters served with horseradish for $21 * We were given around 5~6 differet types of sauce * My favorite is always fresh horseradish and some type of vinegrette * Fresh oysters for less than $2 each is a pretty good deal  Ordered: Seafood Fondue 5/5  * With shrimp, bay scallops, blue crab meat and mushrooms for $14 * This was my favorite dish out of all * Basically a creamy dip that is served with some bread an pita chips * It was seasoned just right and went well with our wine * I almost licked the bottom of the plate, need to go back for this!  Ordered: Bourbon Street Crab Cakes 3/5  * Made in house with blue crab meat topped with roasted red pepper cream sauce for $12 * This was the appetizer we got for free * Crab cakes were mostly crab meat but for some reason it was kind of mushy * I prefer crab cakes to be slightly fried outside since the filling is already very soft in texture * Red pepper cream sauce was a little bland  If you are planning to drop by Big Daddy's, keep in mind that they have 'Voodoo hour' on Monday (4pm to close), Tuesday - Friday (3pm~6pm & 10pm ~ close) and Sunday (4pm to close). Available in the bar area only, you get $2 off from their small plates menu which varies from $6 to $12.  Summary: Overall I really enjoyed my meal at Big Daddy's Bourbon St Bistro. Our server was friendly and I liked the laid back atmosphere of the restaurant. I would def go back and get the seafood fondue and maybe this time I will try to drop by during their Voodoo hour!"}
{"text":"Sad that this location is shutting down and becoming a Texas Lone Star....  BOOOOO!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday evening to take advantage of the happy hour. Great \"medium-plate\" sized selections to choose from. See their menu for specifics on dishes & prices. Everything we ordered between the two of us was off the happy hour menu and came to about $60 CAD total (including drinks & tips): mussels in creole sauce (very tasty, but not exactly \"creole\"), seafood linguine (especially tasty when dipped in the so-called creole sauce), escargot (lots of garlic, very tender), a dozen and a half $1 freshly shucked oysters (small Malpeque was the special of the day), and several rounds of cocktails (exactly 2 oz each -- the concept of drink menus labeled by ounces was quite new to this native Californian). Best part was the wide selection of sauces which accompanied the oysters. The sauces varied from regular malt vinegar to some kind of garlic-infused vodka-based vinegar (or perhaps it was my wish to have a vodka-based sauce). They also serve cocktail sauce and a few other \"exotic\" sauces with varying levels of spice. Interactive food is so much fun! Hopefully other nights at Big Daddy's is more lively than Mondays. All in all, a good time."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was truly excited - love this type of food and was looking forward to it. Nice decor and place - pretty slim list of drinks but that wasn't the main reason I was there.  I ended up trying their jambalaya - which I found rather bland. Quite cheap on the seafood as well (very few shrimps in there) - mostly sausage pieces and lot of pasta to fill up. Somehow felt ripped off. It wasn't bad, but was not impressed at all.  May come back and try other things, especially the more exotic stuff, but if that tastes as bland as the jambalaya, never coming back..."}
{"text":"Glad their bar area served menu items when their dinning hours closed. Might be because of the late hours, their food was good but it could have been better. Clam chowder wasn't bad but had a little bit of grit- hopefully it wasn't sand, a misfortune that of many dishes with clams get cursed with.   Nonetheless, still enjoyed the experience and would consider coming again."}
{"text":"This isn't really about the food as it is the restaurant's social media presence. I find it  odd that they would promote checking in via Foursquare and yet not have a Twitter account and a Facebook page that is only updated occasionally."}
{"text":"I dined here on a Saturday evening without reservations.  Initially, the hostess advised us (myself and two others) that we would need to wait at the bar for about 30 minutes, but a colleague of hers was quick to correct her that they had a table available. It didn't matter to us who made the mistake, we were just glad to get a table.    We had fresh oysters to start.  Their assortment of sauces was satisfactory.  The cocktail sauce was tasty and the shallot vinaigrette tasted perfect, but the shallots were absent from sight.  I would definitely return for fresh oysters.    When we asked our server about the portions for the Crab Shack Boil, she was forthcoming and told us how it's a rather large portion and recommended we order 2 for the three of us.  She was absolutely right.  My party and I did not touch the potatoes since they'd fill us up too quickly.  We left about  of the food behind even though we had barely touched the bread either.  The food was well-seasoned for me, meaning it might be too salty for those who prefer the lighter seasoned taste.  Their garlic butter was to-die-for!    The service was okay.  If you prefer your server approach you every once in a while to check up on you rather than having to flag them down, you're probably better off at Rodney's or Oyster Boy.    I found that the prices here were well worth a switch from my two other favorite oyster joints.  They have featured oysters here, or their 'specials'.  The price of their special was almost a steal.  12 Malpeques for $18.99!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere, the service was really food came on good timing and enjoyed every bit of it!  The wine hmm not so much the greatest but still had a really good time!"}
{"text":"Came to Toronto with the boyfriend and some friends for a weekend of baseball and relaxation.  After the night baseball game, we were walking back to our hotel and wanted to get something to eat.  We were walking around and the majority of the places near the stadium were crazy busy.  So we kept walking until we ran across this place.  From the outside, we werent sure what to expect but our fears quickly disappeared when we walked inside.  The decor made it seem like we were down on Bourbon street in NOLA.  We had some tapas to snack on and some drinks.  The tapas were delicious but the best past is that they were $2 off when we were there.    The only thing that threw us for a surprise was the bartender was smelling the oysters as she was shucking them.  We had ordered some oysters and saw that which made us wonder.  Though our oysters were good and the sauces provided were tasty.  Overall a good spot to grab a drink and a bite to eat.  WIshed we would have had time to grab dinner there.  Guess we have to go back to Toronto to try it again!"}
{"text":"This place is good for seafood especially if you like oysters. They offer a selection of fresh oysters in season that's quite good. They also provide the 3 course prix fixe option. It cost about $25-$30 depending on which entree you get. It's a pretty good deal and makes a nice night out. The place is very close to the entertainment/business district so it's good for hanging out after work - either for a drink (they have a pretty good drink menu) or some casual dinner.   I have chosen to go here tonight for vday. I have made a series of clues for my bf to solve to figure this out. Below is his clue, everyone else can ignore it.  location for bmt to go next: Another online mail platform I use  clue: \"it`s useless\""}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour and all the appetizers are $2 off! But you do have the sit at the bar! Got the chef's special oysters, which was 4 for $6.  The oysters were really fresh and sweet, but they were on the smaller side.  Beer on tap are on the pricer side.  Chill place to talk with your co-workers or grab a simple meal on the bar."}
{"text":"Big Daddy's is one of the first oyster bars I've been to in Toronto. For $26 or $36, you can get a really great 3 course meal. I had the mussels for appetizer, some sort of seafood pasta for the entree and a tart for dessert. We also ordered oysters to share. The chowder also looked pretty good too. I think I would try that next time I'm there.   It's not too fancy and the ambiance is casual. There is a bar and a dining room. During the summer, they also have a small patio outside. For seafood in Toronto, Big Daddy's is a great deal."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often because I love the atmosphere and the seafood is very good. I always get the 12 oysters to start and they come with a great assortment of sauces to put on them. (Beware, one will burn your lips off lol)  then I get the shellfish boil. It's actually by far the best variety and tasty thing on their menu. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I have been a few times to Big Daddy's and it is quite a favorite. The food is good and reasonably priced. I always end up at the bar area but there is a nice seating area with comfy couches and handing plant baskets.   We always get Katie as our waitress, and she is amazing. Super friendly and super energetic, and great for getting menu suggestions! I really enjoy the share plate menu as I get to try different things and they are all delicious.  Recommendations: 1. oyster poboy- fried oyster on crostini with spicy mayo and green pepper 2. alligator- deep fried and mixed with a tomato sauce. served on rice 3. grilled calamari- lightly tossed in tomato sauce and capers 3. seafood fondue- really rich, creamy and cheesy.  4. oysters- served with various sauces and a peppered vodka (yum)  drinks: ceasar martini and hurricane martini!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. We went for summerlicious, even though they have a permanent $26 3-course menu with more option. The mussels were amazing and the chowder. Not deathly creamy. The catfish was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the jambalaya, so good.  The bread pudding was a tad bit dense but great taste and the pecan tart was perfect. The service was very slow especially to start, nearly 20 minutes before we got acknowledged."}
{"text":"I was sad to see this place close. The scotch bonnet sauce was delish."}
{"text":"Disappointing, even though our entrees were good. This was our 2nd time here and it seems management is letting things go down hill. We wanted to try the alligator hors d'oeuvres, but they haven't had any for months. I even checked their menu online and it was still listed. They ran out of 2 of the 4 dessert choices and there was no after dinner coffee. Apparently their machine was broken. Theiy did offer instant coffee... Yech! The wonderful server apologized on behalf of the manager and did adjust our bill by taking off the cost of the desserts. We all felt the manager should have seen us in person. Too bad, won't be returning any time soon as there are so many restaurant choices along King Street.  The Lion King was great though!"}
{"text":"During our last trip to Toronto, our friends decided on Big Daddy's for dinner one evening and we joined them after our trip up the CN Tower. Located close to the Tower, we took a  relatively short walk to regain our bearings after the giant elevator ride and, although I was a little leery going for Cajun food in the middle of Toronto, we were willing to give it a shot.   We headed down the stairs off King Street and were quickly directed to our party that was already seated in the front corner of the restaurant. According to the menu, we were in the sweet spot of what they call Voodoo Hours where all small plates were $2 off and we capitalized on that by ordering the jalapeño cornbread, Creole flavored mussels and the open faced oyster po boy to share and make up our meal.  The jalapeño cornbread was decent with a small amount of spice although nothing else really stood out about it. The oyster po boy was easily the best of three dishes we had with a nice amount of perfectly fried oysters on top of toasted bread with a little bit of what they call \"Chipotle Tabsaco remoulade\" that came across as a mildly tangy mayo sauce without the expected bold flavors. Very tasty and gave me a taste for fried oysters I won't soon forget. The mussels were the biggest disappointment with overpowering amounts of celery even for a Creole dish. The spice was a bit much and the sauce didn't come together flavor wise even with the mussels cooked in it. I love mussels and this was just a bad showing.  All in all I'm not sure I'd recommend the place to people when visiting town but if you were really hunting for oysters or if you live in town and need a change in pace this wouldn't be a terrible option. More like 2.5 than 3, I'll give it the extra because my fiancée liked the cornbread and the sandwich was interesting."}
{"text":"I can't think of many good things to say. The fettucine jambalaya was good if you like bland chicken, bland shrimp, bland tomato cream sauce and some weird, semi spicy sausage. The service is severely lacking, and the atmosphere is decidedly not New Orleans. I'm from Louisiana by the way, as are my two friends who dined with me. Skip it."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place was the Ottawa location and it was delicious. Of course the company I was with (Eddie) was amazing so anything would have tasted amazing.  I was shocked to be leaving the The Royal Alex Theatre in Toronto and to stumble into the Toronto location, again with Eddie.  Of course we went in and while it looks very different, very festive, the menu was very similar.  Try the seafood fondue, very rich, creamy and great for sharing."}
{"text":"Ambience was very cozy , loved the decor I felt like I was in someone's home versus restaurant . Wait staff was very attentitive , I think the manager even came to assist as well. We orderded the 3 course meal for $30. We both ordered Mussels, I had fish and chips , he had steak, desert was pecan pie and bread pudding , I was full halfway though my fish and chips, had to take deserts to go.  The food was really good, my only complaint was the breading of the fish was a bit mushy insteady of flakey. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This is my spot. I love coming here.  I started coming here when my friend introduced me to the Voodoo hour which is special times they have discounts. The oysters ended up costing about $1.25 a piece. Be careful, it depends on the season, some times it very thin and not juicy. Also if you come late night there is a chance it might be sold out.  I've tried a lot on the menu and everything is really good. My faves are Crispy Calamari, popcorn shimp, the Knife & Fork Pulled Pork is really really good, and the cajun-fried alligator is good but small. The ribs were okay, not that great.  I also recommend their 3 course prix fixe meals which are very full and filling.  The atmosphere is nice, quiet and private which is good. They always have the TV going so if you are on a bad date you got something to entertain yourself. The only drawback is you always have to pay for parking no matter what time you go."}
{"text":"this place has some of the worst food ever!!! the alligator tasted like rubber and everything tasted like it was frozen reheated food.  Wildly disappointing! save your money and go somewhere nice on king st"}
{"text":"The food was alright, we went for apps around 11pm on Mar 27, 2015.  There wasn't anything outstanding and the oysters were small.    Good service, however the food wasn't great but wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I thought this was going to be one of those cheesy over-themed spots where I might be sitting on wooden picnic tables with chequered table cloths.   However it's pretty elegant inside.  I enjoyed sitting at the handsome bar with a beer, bowl of nicely done mussels, while the friendly staff shucked oysters in front of us."}
{"text":"It's my first time here and I came here for dinner, it was a great experience, the service was excellent; waitress was very informative and nice. What my bf and I ordered from the $26 - 3 course prix fix menu:  Appetizers: Popcorn Shrimp - Good portion. tasted fresh, crispy and delicious! Good dips come with it as well. Crispy Calamari - it was nicely breaded, crispy, and plentiful!  Entrees: Bronzed fish of the Day - I chose the Tilapia fish, you also have the option of Catfish and Mahi Mahi fish! The rice and fish was seasoned very well! Veggies were okay. Creole Fish and Chips - comes with a side of no-mayo coleslaw, lots of home cut fries and 2 big pieces of fish. I'm not sure if the batter was suppose to be this color, but it was a very dark brown, it almost looked burnt. Tasted pretty good but would have been better if the fish was cooked to a golden brown color.  Deserts: Creme Brulee - I'm a huge fan of this type of desert, it was done very well here. Creamy and delicious with a nice hard sugar layer on top! Bread Pudding - tasted good with the vanilla ice cream, nothing spectacular though.  Dozen of Chef's Choice Oysters - it was $21 which is a pretty good deal. We got 12 mapleque oysters on a bed of ice! I enjoyed the home-made sauces that it came with, very creative and fun to eat.  Overall, it was a good experience. I would probably come back next time just for oysters and maybe some appetizers. The seafood fondue looks really good!"}
{"text":"Great little place... Romantic setting..... Love the interior. Went in with a friend for a quick bite between a meeting.   Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I am not a seafood fan, but it was a friends bday and i had to show face. It was a pretty large group and we got to try multiple items and share. So i got a pretty good idea of the menu. Oysters were by far my favourite, the assortment of sauces and relishes made it fun. Lobster was standard, wll sized for the price. Overall, was a good time, however do not order the po boy shrimp. Was soo dry and no flavour for a cajun place. They have a greaat drink menu as well."}
{"text":"I came here on a date...June 2012.  Food is legit. Clam Chowder wins, and so do the oysters.   Had the gumbo which was tasty and to top it off, an incredible peanut butter cupcake for dessy.  I really liked it here, meal for two was $80.00 prixe fixe...cant really go wrong with that. As it was my treat, I def was happy.  The atmosphere is so chilled out - not a place to dress up but is on theatre strip so if you are going to check a show out, good place for before hand dinner.   decor is all wonky and different but familiar. nothing too crazy.   Anyone could enjoy a dinner here, irrespective of age, demographic, etc.   service was okay that's why I took off one star."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now and always have been satisfied with great creole food. We've made it a point to come during their vodooo hours special because that's what really set this place apart from all the others in Toronto. It made it a good affordable place, I'm disappointed to say that I just came back and not only have prices gone up but vodooo hours are gone.   In my opinion it's a bad decision by management I highly recommended this place and brought tons of people but now it's just as expensive as everywhere else in Toronto and now I'll look elsewhere instead of making this my go to place. I'll probably still be back, the food is good; but I won't be recommending or making this the only place I'm willing to eat at in Toronto when visiting the city.  Here's hoping management sees this and brings it back."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and dinner summerlicious, and both times were pretty good. Although the best dessert was the pecan tart by far, I was quite disappointed when I tried the Ponchatoula strawberries and the bread pudding, definitely go for their pecan tarts! The Jambalaya was pretty good, it had lots of chorizo and big shrimps! I would definitely go here again for their regular prix fixe dinners, not just for summerlicious"}
{"text":"I used to love Big Daddy's.  I'd come here and order up and share a bunch of appetizers.  For me it was like a creating a faux dim-sum experience.  This time around however, they had a price fix menu.  I brought a friend here for her first time and were both excited.  I was building up the whole experience.  The service has always been fairly decent every time I've been and the food sometimes is a bit hit and miss.  We were there in the first early sitting as we were going out to a show after wards.  Unfortunately the food was awful.  Our salads were soggy, and must have been predressed and sitting there for a while.  What was worse, our mains were cold!  I had some kind of catfish thing, and she was a steak I think.  We pointed out that both our dishes were cold to the touch and got new ones, and guess what?  The exact same thing.  By this time, it was running late, and we may have both consumed 30% of the meal?  To be honest, we were expecting some kind of comp or some sort or at least a discount.  But nothing.  Because we were running late, we didn't have time to talk to a manager.  To be fair, the server seemed apologetic, and she was friendly, but the food was unacceptable.  This is coming from someone who used to LOVE BDCS.  It's a one star for this experience."}
{"text":"Big Daddy's - I can't count the number of times that an oyster recommendation has been requested and this name comes up!  Unfortunately, oysters were not a part of the Dishcrawl menu so I'll have to go back!  The venue itself is pretty cool.  In the middle you have an elevated \"gazebo\" filled with plush lounge chairs and small tables... perfect for a jazz band to set up and for people to enjoy a few drinks.  Towards the back you have decor that mimics houses you would see down south with hanging planters above your head.  Hope those are on there sturdily!  On the menu tonight, as explained by Big Daddy manager Carlos would be a traditional Jalapeno Corn Bread topped with bruschetta and mozzarella, coconut shrimp with sweet marmalade sauce and farm-raised alligator (tail meat, which is supposed to be the most tender part) on a bed of chorizo-creole sauce and a cornmeal batter.    Everything I tasted was very flavourful.  My favourite would've been the coconut shrimp.  I don't know if it was the batter itself, or that the sweet marmalade sauce really brought out the coconut flavour, but this was indeed a COCONUT shrimp!  The alligator was tender, and if I hadn't known better I probably would've thought it was chicken!  The jalapeno corn bread would've been better on its own, as I found the bruschetta and mozzarella not only made the bread soggy, but also detracted from the goodness of the bread.  The restaurant itself features good, down-south cooking from New Orleans, featuring recipes from the founder's mother, who was born and raised in Louisiana.  Almost all of their food is made in-house (95%).  It is worth mentioning that Monday-Wednesdays is their $5 bar rail featuring double shots (2oz drinks).  If you want Bourbon though, that will COST you double!"}
{"text":"I came in for a pick up order of pan seared scallops and Cajun fried alligator. The food was delicious and I'll probably go back. Unfortunately, the service sucked. The restaurant wasn't that busy (Wednesday evening, just after 9pm), but I still waited ten minutes for the bartender to grab my order that was probably dying in the kitchen for at least 5 of those 10 minutes. I had called ahead to place my order about 30 minutes before I arrived, and was expecting my order to be ready for pickup upon arrival since I was told it would be ready \"when I got there\" (her words) - being an estimate of 10 - 15 minutes at the time of the call.  All of the waitresses were focused on serving the customers at their tables and  didn't even seem to care when I mentioned that I parked my car on the street and was trying to avoid getting a parking ticket.  In what seemed like a disrespectful period of time-lapse, another server brought up my food and the bartender took payment for my order. I ended up getting a parking ticket (within the 10 minutes of me being there); therefore, I'm glad that I didn't tip the bartender because she didn't care about my business and made it obvious that I was distracting her from her \"real customers\". The joke's on her because I WOULD have. At the end of the day, the negative rapport has been established and I most likely won't tip her the next time either... But she'll still have to serve me;)  I would have given a 2star review but I gave  3 stars because the food was actually worth the wait."}
{"text":"We had seen Big Daddy's before on our last trip, but didn't venture in so we decided to check it out this time up in Toronto. We love New Orleans and cajun food so we were pretty excited to get in and try it. It's a cool looking place and the atmosphere inside is nice. There wasn't room in the dinning room, but you can order dinner in the bar/lounge area. It's definitely a great place for after work drinks and they have a decent small plate menu, but I'm not sure on the rest of the menu or the dishes being anything close to authentic New Orleans cuisine. It's a bit pricey for what they offer, but it's to be expected in downtown, however we've eaten at steakhouses where you get even more for the same price. Our service was average at best and it seemed like our waitress disappeared off the face of the planet so we had a carousel of people come to the table. Not sure what else is available for this type of food, but you might want to look elsewhere before settling on here."}
{"text":"Love the menu, service is good, tasty dishes  Never been disappointed  Old hang out with friends"}
{"text":"Quality! What a great environment for drinks or cheap oysters! Always specials that you want to try! Excellent service, great pricing, local to everything. And who doesn't like to say they are going to big daddy's!!?"}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for awhile now! So I was super excited to give it a go for girls night out.  The staff was super friendly and our waiter was great on food suggestions. The atmosphere was nice and quiet but I can see the bar was a happening place by the time we left.   As for the food, my group went with the 3 course prix fixe menu. What was ordered for the apps were the fried pickles, clam chowder and cornbread. They all looked delicious when they arrived to the table and it was in a timely matter as well. However, the downfall came for the mains. I ordered the southern fried chicken and it was very good! With a touch of more sauce, it would be perfecto! Yum yum! One of the gals ordered the Jambalaya and ended up getting food poisoning from the dish. So that is a big \"no no.\"   In the end, it was a good experience to try a place I've always wanted to go too. But, the fact my friend was sick for two days off the Jambalaya makes me weary to return sadly."}
{"text":"Great seafood!  They let us switch some items in their crab boil for more crab.  Love this place.   Cornbread is awesome. ..order an extra one....you can thank me later"}
{"text":"My Fiancee' wanted to know what this place was all about. Seeing as to how I won't get the chance to take her down to New Orleans, this would be a decent compromise. The atmosphere is definitely trying to recreate the authentic \"Nawlins\" style restaurant, but they seem to be trying a little too hard. All you need is a large silver pot, and a guy standing next to it smacking whatever is trying to crawl out of it... Anywho..  So yes, the restaurant is packed full of flare. The servers were attentive and seemed pretty happy to be there, which is amazing considering when we were there, a band was playing pretty loudly and after a whole evening of that I would be seeking blood. However they must be used to it because each time we interacted everyone was giddy.  We ordered the alligator bites as an appetizer. I was expecting little legs covered in bread to come to my table, but it was essentially chunks of chicken like meat. They were alright and had a good flavor to them. She ordered the seafood Fettuccine and I decided on Linguine Jambalaya. She was overly impressed with her dish. The different pieces of seafood that were on it were enough that there was a good pasta/meat ratio. Mine on the other hand was mostly huge chunks of sausage. There were 3 small shrimp, and what looked like a half chicken breast. The flavor was a little on the peppery side and was also a little dry.  The presentation was nice with rather large strange shaped plates, but given the limit of table space, this turned out to be more of a hindrance than anything. We decided we enjoyed our experience, but for the amount per dish that is charged, we hoped to be a little more impressed with the food than we were. We may be back sometime."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, mostly for their Small Plates menu and once for their Prix-Fixe menu.   Some notable highlights include:  Clam Chowder: I'm just as critical to Clam Chowder as I am to Pulled Pork. They don't gip you on clams, and it's not overly creamy. Plus the serving size is pretty big for an appetizer / small plate.  Oysters Rockefeller: Baked oysters with a blend of three cheeses = total comfort.  Seafood Fondue: Nice, creamy blend of cheese and a variety of seafood. Perfect ratio of bread to fondue too. My friend thought there wasn't enough bread, but she's not the type that smothers their bread with dip.  Honorable mentions: - Jambalaya - Oysters Po-Boy - Shrimp, Crab & Chorizo Fritters  My only tip for the Small Plates menu is to order in stages, instead of ordering everything at once. I typically work my way up to the good stuff, and by then, the food can get cold."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Good small plates appetizers, the oysters were really good.  The service was meh, and they wouldn't let us have Voodoo Hour on the patio?? Which is kind of weird. They also gave us a hard time abt. a big group on the patio.   Overall, an ok experience. Solid food, cool place."}
{"text":"My bf n I came here for my birthday because im a huge seafood fan and my love for it was definitely satisfied. We had the chefs oysters and the seafood fondue to start and then indulged in the shellfish boil and big daddys mixed platter. Everything was good. The oysters were okay but the sauces to go with them were amazing. The service was good the server was very friendly. The only negative is that the food took soooo long we waited 20 min for apps and then another 25 min for our mains by which time we were stuffed before we could fully enjoy our entrees."}
{"text":"Good blackened catfish and decent gumbo.   Patio is a nice option too.  Service was good too!  I was there for lunch"}
{"text":"They have good food here, make sure you make reservations, it gets busy here even on week days.   The wait staff is a bit slow but they are all very friendly.  the chef's selection of oysters... he always gives us the smallest one he can find and it's not good kind if you know what I mean.  I like to get my Cajun fix here, and especially when they have the CRAWFISH Boil, I wish they would do this more often. and the crawfish arrived late this year (2014) and we were done dinner by the time it came :( so disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and we ate many starters/first course items.  Oysters were good, well cleaned, nicely served. Loved the seafood fondue but not just what was expected.  Sit in the bar area and just relax with dishes as you go.  This is a great date night or just a hang out and eat and drink well place. We did not eat in the dining room so cannot comment on that area.  Would go again."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto. It has a very interesting decor and periodic special events. Last Thursday I went to their free crawfish event; the crawfish was absolutely delicious and came with sides, but I also got their creole mussel which are the best I have had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went during winterlicious a few weeks ago; the staff were friendly and food was a disappointment. Ordered my first jambalaya it was very bland & not spice for me."}
{"text":"After spending the day at Sugar Beach, our group decided to come here to try and get some seafood. Overall, we weren't disappointed but the place didn't knock our socks off.  First, the decor is fine - a bit more steak house than Bourbon Street but otherwise it's not too noisy so you can enjoy your meal without having to shout at your friends. Second, service was good - the waitress was attentive, somewhat quick, and kept things coming quickly.  The only thing about the food was that it was rather bland. Needed a lot of hot sauce - I asked for the Big Daddy's Mixed platter and while I was not disappointed by the portion size, the flavor didn't match. But, a little hot sauce spiked things in the right direction and I had no issues finishing most of the meal.  Prices are reasonable so you'll walk out feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Confused tis with a previous incarnation of the chain, which used to serve buckets of crayfish. This place apparently does it once a year. Attended for a duo birthday celebration and was underwhelmed. Lobster Rex was plumped with mashed potatoes, when advertised as stuffed with crab. Red Lobster does it better and doesn't over cook it. Gumbo soup was pleasant but had very little of the advertised ingredients, just lots of rice. My two friends had the bronzed salmon and said it was good. Definitely not returning, even though they are serving buckets of crayfish next week.   Really would like servers to corral screaming kids!"}
{"text":"I really liked Big Daddy's. I came here on a Sunday night for a birthday party. We had reservations for 8 pm.  We waited for about 10 minutes as the hostess set up our tables (I thought they'd already be ready before we got there). The birthday girl let the waitress know there would be more people coming. About 10 more. We were put in a back room (the space is bigger than I thought it would be!) but because of the amount of people, we had to sit in two separate rows because the space isn't wide enough to accommodate a long table. This was fine.  I really liked the fixed price menu, they had so many things to try and it was only a dollar more than the summerlicious menu ($26 for an app, main, and dessert!).  I ordered the gumbo soup (amazing), jambalaya fettuccini (super good), and pecan tart with ice cream (yum).  The soup was really, really good. The fettuccini could have had a bit more sauce but I definitely liked it. The pecan tart was good, I wasn't fond of the gelatinous texture, but the tart, pecans, and ice cream tasted very good!  I also tried the cheese fondue with chicken. It smelled amazing and tasted even better! I tried some of my boyfriend's fish and chips and I don't love fries (I love ketchup) but these fries were unreal! They were so delicious, probably the best fries I've had.  I also had the corn bread and butter which I quite enjoyed.  I had a cosmo which was $9. It was good but small. I didn't see any beer list in the drink menu.  I didn't try any oysters this time around. I'll be coming back to try those!  Our server was working hard, it was just one girl. It did take a long time for our mains to come out and then a while for our dessert to come out after that. By the time we got our bills it was after 11:30 (ahhh, on a work night). She did bring around some water pitchers but we drained those pretty quickly and I asked two times for her to bring more water but there were periods where we didn't have any. She was patient and polite and great with splitting bills though.  I think if it had been a smaller group, these little things wouldn't have been a problem. No matter, because I did really enjoy my meal here and will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 11pm on a Friday night. Our server was great, really friendly and attentive. We started with some drinks: margarita and cosmo. Both were weak and boring. Then we shared a giant piece of jalapeno corn bread - which we hadn't. It was boring (as well), bland, and not worth the calories. I then got excited about the jambalaya, which the waitress described as great. It wasn't. It was small, uninteresting, barely any spice and barely any meat/sausage. I also got a salad, which was tiny with few ingredients and disappointing, especially for the price."}
{"text":"I'm saddened by the bad reviews :( . My husband and I go to Big Daddy's all the time and we love it!. Voo-Doo hours are great! We go for late night drinks, appetizers and OYSTERS. My favorite is the Goat Cheese appetizer. The prices are very reasonable. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Looks like a dive when you walk down the steps... But the place has lots of atmosphere... Had great seafood and pasta... Service great."}
{"text":"An underground restaurant, friendly atmosphere, really nice & interesting interior with reds & earth color motif.   I ate some of the folllowing:  -corn battered flesh of alligator tail with chorizo creole sauce   -small malpeque oysters  with 6 different sauces of escalating hotness levels  -coconut shrimp   My favorite dish, was the alligator tail as it was tender, & most flavorful with a texture very much like chicken, but only better & heartier in an indescribable way.  Malpeques sweetness & saltiness were well balanced, the sauces made things more interesting by adding extra flavor to the complexity.   Coconut shrimps were really tasty, though nothing out of the ordinary.   Our server was very attentive & friendly, & she always kept our glasses topped with cold water. At some point in the future, I could see myself coming back here with a group of people"}
{"text":"All the atmosphere of an East Side Mario's at twice the price. The food would be fine if entrees were less expensive. I was there with two vegetarians, and the options were pretty dismal."}
{"text":"Oysters weren't that great. Appetizers were very meh.. food experience = I've had better.  Service on the friday evening was intermittent (we had to hunt down our waitress every time).   Not impressed. Not going back. I don't hate it but there's so many better places for this kinda money within a 10 minute walk."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting this Theatre District restaurant to be delicious, but the blackened catfish was delicious! The sizable portion came with rice and some veggies and it was beyond satisfying! Everyone else around the table enjoyed their meals. Others had ordered my same dish and they all expressed their approval.  The restaurant is actually underground and for that reason, it is too dark, despite the lighting and the windows you can see above you. It is large enough to accommodate groups."}
{"text":"If you're looking for tasty seafood options downtown Toronto, look no more.  This places has everything you need.  I went here on a date here and immediately fell in love with the food here.  We came regularly as it quickly  became our favourite date night restaurant.  Their Voodoo hour (similar to a Happy Hour) offers great menu options at a reduced price if you're sitting in the bar side.  I recommend the Caesars.  My absolute favourite dish is the seafood fondue.  It's to die for.  They also have many oyster sauces to mix and mingle on your plate to find the perfect sauce for freshly shucked goodness.  If you like chowder too, then this place is a must visit.  I honestly couldn't say anything bad about this place.  Dress casual, and dig in!"}
{"text":"I've visited here for Winterlicious from before and I thought it wasn't too special.. but my bf wanted to try here.. so here I was again..  Service was good.   We ordered: OYSTERS (CHEF'S CHOICE) This was good - had a good selection of sauces.  BOURBON STREET CRAB CAKES Way too mushy.. There were no textures within the crab cake. It's just all mushy crab meat with a bland taste.  BIG DADDY'S SHELLFISH BOIL Over-cooked and not good at all :( I'd have to say the corn is probably the best part of this dish."}
{"text":"Sad to see this place close. I have good memories of this place with my fiancé before getting married.   You will be missed big daddy!"}
{"text":"Wait staff is extremely nice and serviceable.  My meal was good but the crab cakes app was more filler than crab meat, the oyster Rockefeller app were good. My friend had the mixed seafood entree and he liked it. I opted for the lobster and was very happy with it."}
{"text":"Whenever I go into Big Daddy's I always feel like I'm going to be cheated for some reason, but the place is surprisingly good.  Just the name of the place and the kind-of-polished almost-franchise-y look of the place always makes me feel like I'm not going to have a good time here.  But by the time I get a beer, have some oysters, and get something blackened, I'm feeling okay.  Below street level, Big Daddy's always warns you to mind your step as you walk in.  So do.  Once inside a nice urban-chic bar and lounge is visible and the run of drinks there is decent enough.  Once seated in one of the main atriums, the décor has flavours of New Orleans but is not overpoweringly gaudy about it.  All in all, it's pretty tasteful.  The staff are typically fun and efficient and helpful with the menu if need be.  One of the last times I was in Big Daddy's I took a stab at the oysters and found them to be decent enough for a place that doesn't make it a principle dish like Rodney's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/rodneys-oyster-house-toronto), or Oyster Boy (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/oyster-boy-toronto).  The rest of the menu follows suit and ranges from decent to tasty.  Not a bad place at all, and you won't feel cheated."}
{"text":"Let's just get this out of the way--I'm not a fan of seafood....but I AM a fan of food, and what I can tell you is the folks at Big Daddy's are some of the most accommodating restaurant staff I've happened upon.  Although those at my table that had the oysters said they were bad, (sorry, there's no other way to say it) they were extremely accommodating in replacing those dishes. In addition, I made their lives a little more complicated by trying to make non-vegetarian dish vegetarian and they more than obliged. I also got a chocolate lava cake imitation (cant' find it on the menu anymore!) that was WAY too sweet.  All in all, service was great, but food seems a bit iffy."}
{"text":"On the whim of a hangover Saturday and a quest for alligator meat my brother and I decided that a quest to creole castle was necessary. Once getting our brains wrapped around the idea of putting on street clothes and leaving the house, which took about 3 hours of staring at the television, we made with haste on the people's chariot (read streetcar). We arrived around 2:30pm thinking of a late lunch, where we found a very closed restaurant. We searched about the place looking for hours of operation to no avail, eventually we called a friend to look it up on the internet (as the restaurant's website hates my blackberry), where we came to the startling realization that we would have to come back at 4pm. With an hour and a half to kill we went to the Shoeless Joe's down the block (to be reviewed late) drank and swore like sailors until the hour of feast was upon us.  I have to say that I appreciated the darkened jazzy atmosphere, with it's Cajun fishermen details and N'Orleans oyster bar style, as it went well with the efficient buzz that I had collected. Unfortunately with the smoking ban in Ontario this place did not reek of cigarettes and cigars with in my opinion took away from the authenticity, but I digress. Heck this upperclass dining establishment was trying so hard to be a blues dive bar they even had novelty signs, such as; \"Our credit manager is Helen Waite. If you want credit, go to Helen Waite\". We made our way to the bar and we didn't have reservations for the entirely empty restaurant and couldn't possibly serve us anywhere else.  The food. After perusing the menu for sometime and with slight intoxication fantasizing about all the different types of sea animals we could eat, we finally decided to create our own tasting menu to split in order to maximize our oceanic slaughter. We opened our experience with the 'Chef's Choice half dozen oysters' which were excellent, served with more sauces than you could shake a stick at, I know as I was to stop shaking my stick at them, fresh grated horseradish and lemon wedges.  Next we had 'Cajun fried alligator' and as expected with was quite good, though how could you not like a deep-fried piece moist alligator served over a spicy marinara sauce, you can't it's impossible.  Finally we had \"Big Daddy's Mixed Platter\" which is described as: Broiled or pecan-crusted jumbo shrimp, king crab, bronzed catfish and jalapeño bacon-wrapped scallops, served with seasonal  vegetables and Creole-style rice. Upon the recommendation of our server, who in this case is also the bartender and the 'Chef' that makes the oyster selections, we chose the pecan crusted shrimp for that optional portion. Upon it's arrival I could tell that my disappoint for this dish was looming. In Haute cuisine style my plate was piled very high. As a base was a small hill of creole rice, which although good tasted pretty much like a Zatarain instant rice. On the side of my rice hill was a selection of mediocre mixed vege, carrots, zucchini and green beans, all of which were blanched to a slightly less then al dente, I am sure they have a dressing but it was unmemorable. On the other side of the hill was the 3 micro-jumbo-shrimp, what a oxymoron that was, fried in a crust of apparently pecan. I believe to qualify as jumbo in size the shrimp must be a 10-15ct and the minuscule specimens that was served to me would be extremely lucky if they came near the 15 side of that, and these were obviously previously frozen. At the base of the hill were the jalapeño bacon-wrapped scallops, there were fine though the scallops were overcooked I was compensated by the bacon which they had some how infused with jalapeño. Laying over the peak was the bronzed catfish, which I imagine would have been more palatable if it were actually bronzed in metal, it tasted of being previously frozen, dull with spice and a hint of laying out too long, so I spat out the bite I took of this offended fish. Did I mention that this dish came with butter heated by tea candle? Well it did and in fact it was put down on the bar long before the mixed plate had arrived, it was there taunting me letting my whimsically imagine the the crab legs that were coming, oh the delicate texture, the juice of the shell snapping through the claw pulling out every delicate morsel.  Reality set in for this whole platter right as soon as it was served due to this detail alone, the king crab, which served as the spire above the hill of rice, the body of catfish, the embattlements of vege and shrimp and the village of scallops, which although what was there was good there had only been a meagre 1 and 1/4th of a crab claw/leg, it was to say the least disheartening.   In summary the food was for the most part good, however the parts that were lacking were very lacking and at worst inedible."}
{"text":"I came here last Saturday with my parents and bf to celebrate my dad's birthday. I've been here several times before and so I knew the food would be good.   My bf and I ordered from their Prix Fixe menu and my parents ordered from the regular menu, getting a soup to share for their starters. I ordered their clam chowder which I had many times before and it never disappoints! The soup is smooth and creamy with rich flavours from the clams. Definitely a must-have. I chose the steak from the Prix Fixe menu and asked for medium rare. The steak was cooked perfectly and tasted great with the cracked pepper sauce. The vegetables were nice and crispy which went well with the steak. My bf ordered the chicken from the Prix Fixe menu and he loved it. He said the chicken was very tender and moist on the inside and that the tomato sauce was delicious. Both my parents ordered the Mixed Platter because it offered a bit of everything. I tried some of the bacon, shrimp and lobster and I have to say that everything was absolutely delicious! The seasonings they used were very tasty and they enhanced the flavours of the seafood. For dessert we got chocolate ice cream and pecan tart a la mode. The pecan tart was still very hot and fresh, and the filling tasted wonderful with the perfect amount of sweetness.   Overall, we had a great experience at Big Daddy's and enjoyed the delicious food as always. I recommend choosing from the 3 course Prix Fixe menu because they offer a variety of different dishes to choose from and it's all worth it for the price of $29."}
{"text":"This is going to be a really weird review for two reasons. The first and most important is that I do not like seafood. The second is that they have some really good wines in bottle, to which a few of those have been finished as of just an hour ago. Basically, this is a review based on \"turf\" and not much \"surf\", and plenty of booze. So here we go!  When first arriving it had more of a pub feel to the restaurant than a Red Lobster feel, which made me feel more at home and in my proper element. We were a group of 16, but within 5 minutes of being seated we all had drinks in front of us and were being told the specials. After reading over the menu, I went with their \"3-course prix fixe\" option where I chose coconut-crusted chicken tenders as the appetizer, Big Daddy's BBQ pork back ribs as the entrée, and the red velvet sweet treat cupcake as the dessert. On top of that I added the cajun-fried alligator to be adventurous on the free appetizer from joining their mailing list.  The first thing that was put in front of me very quickly was the alligator. I was kind of worried about giving it a try, but when I got the courage to take the first bite I was amazed. When it came out it looked kind of like small nuggets of breaded chicken, and that gave me a little bit of a push to actually eat it. I am very picky when it comes to food (as you might have read in my previous reviews), but I have been trying to broaden my horizons and try new things, and alligator is definitely something new. It had a taste that seems like a mix of popcorn shrimp and chicken, but with the consistency of a medium rare cooked steak that was breaded and deep fried. It was really good, to the point that I shared it with others at the table. Those who know me know that I DO NOT share my food, but this was so random and good that I had to. I was impressed already.  The coconut-crusted chicken tenders were not quite as good. They were not horrible, but they were no where near as tasty as the alligator had been. I tried the first one without the jalapeño & orange dipping sauce that came with it, just to give it a proper try. Because of how thin the chicken was, I tasted more toasted coconut than anything else. Also because of how thing the chicken was, the chicken itself was kind of dry with the skewering and deep frying process. It was not horrible by any means, but it is not something I would order again if there was something else on the menu that I thought could compare (like the popcorn shrimp).  The ribs were fall off the bone for sure! They were cooked perfectly and the meat was very good and quite lean. Back ribs are usually lean, but these were meaty with steal being very lean which you don't find so often. The sauce that was on the ribs was a little sub-par though. When eating the ribs I definitely knew I was at a seafood restaurant. Whether that is good or bad I will let you decide as it IS a seafood restaurant, but I was not impressed by it. Usually I love sweet potato fries, but this was the rare occasion when I wish I had ordered regular fries as they were soggy and even if cooked a little longer they still would have suffered by being underneath the moist ribs. The entrée was not as impressing as the appetizer was.  I am a sucker for dessert and have come to love red velvet cake. They instead went with the smaller red velvet in cupcake form. While the red velvet part of it was quite good, the icing to cake ratio was a little low for my liking. Red velvet cake is really good, but it is the icing that gives it that extra zip into really good, but this just didn't have what it took to get to that level. It was still a very moist cupcake, but it was small and lacking in too many ways to think of as excellent.  A couple of those in the group got the 7oz beef tenderloin steak that was on the feature menu, and their opinion was even though the size was quite small, the steak itself was amazing and full of flavour. I took a small bite and know what I will be ordering the next time I am at Big Daddy's. One of them also got the fries which were a whole lot better than the mushy sweet potato fries that I got with my meal. I didn't taste the garlic roasted red skin potatoes, but that does sound quite nice. Everyone else (and that is 16 of us in total which is very hard to please) really enjoyed their meals and it was a good experience by everyone.  The two waitresses that we did have serving us were really great and courteous, and our main girl was also very knowledgeable about the food and what was good on the menu. Overall it was a great experience and the ambiance of the place was really nice. I recommend not just the restaurant (even to people who don't like seafood) and the alligator, but also the Dancing Bull wine which exceeded my expectations and was a great recommendation from out main waitress. Big Daddy's Crabshack & Oyster Bar is somewhere that I will be returning too, even if I am not into creatures of the sea."}
{"text":"This is my home location, and I have been here many times over the years.  However, this review is of my most recent visit... THE annual crawfish boil!  It happens every year! Hundreds of pounds of fresh crawfish are boiled in a mingle of creole flavours with corn, potatoes, and sausages.   The best part is every patron gets a FREE hearty sample brought to you at your table!  I expertly planned to revisit Big Daddy's yesterday evening to gorge on some crawduds.  Knowing that the boil starts at 5pm and ends whenever it runs out, the two of us arrived at 6pm to ensure we didn't have to wait for a seat, but more importantly, that they still have plenty!  There was already a little line of a couple parties in wait, and the bar was getting packed as well.  We lucked out to find a seat on the patio, where live jazz was playing and crawduds were boiling.  AWESOME!  Right away, I ordered a caesar to drink, which came in a little condiment stand w tobasco and another sauce... so cute!  There were also beer ambassador girls promoting the new Coor Lite Iced T (CLIT), so we got a free sample of that.  Then it just keeps  getting better, the crawduds came! As we got messy with those, we also ordered:  Oysters Rockefeller Soup: $7 (3/5 stars) It was creamy (but not too thick), and had BACONN!! Very good, but I wish it had oyster bits in it.  Bourbon Street Crab Cakes: $12 (4/5 stars) I am SO picky with crabcakes.  I like both breaded and unbreaded ones, but its gotta be with the right amount of cooking, breading, crabbing, saucing... the whole deal.  This is one of the better UNbreaded crab cakes in the city with actual crab meat, and a creamy rouille.  My only criticism is that it could've used a bit more sauce.  3-COURSE PRIX-FIXE $26   PEI Mussels: (3.5/5 stars) We opted for the white wine sauce.  Tastes like your regular mussels mariniere.  Bronzed Fish of the Day: (4/5 stars) CATFISH! YUM!  Generous portion perfectly cooked, served on a bed of their creole-style rice, and mixed veg.    Bread Pudding: (4/5 stars) We decided to keep this a very New Orleans-themed day with this choice.  Simple bread pudding served warm with vanilla ice cream  Service: (4/5 stars) It was busy, but the server still looked after us and ensured we got everything.  I love this annual tradition!! Great music, people-watching, free crawfish, free beer, great drinks, good food for a good price... all right in the financial core of Toronto!  Expect me there next year again!"}
{"text":"Tonight is my second time there, it seem like the first time was better ( a year ago) for some reasons. I like the clam crawler soup, the main course I asked the fish of the day, (forgot the name of the fish), It was fried  and with some Cajan style fried rice...wasn't too impressive. Dessert was breaded pudding, I didn't really like it too, don't think it should call pudding..."}
{"text":"I went here with a group for lunch today to check out their Winterlicious menu. I loved the atmosphere in the restaurant; it was very clean and nicely decorated (it's Mardi Gras without most of the tacky/overly stereotypical elements that I've seen in similar restaurants, which makes it seem more classy in my opinion).  I ordered the popcorn shrimp for my appetizer, which came with a tomato/pepper sauce. I liked the shrimp but felt that the sauce was not well suited to the dish. The main course I ordered was jambalaya, and for days before this lunch I was looking forward to the kick of spice that I've found in every jambalaya that I've had. When I received the dish, I was seriously disappointed to find that it had very little spice/seasoning at all. I am not a spice fanatic by any stretch, so it is significant when I consider a dish to be too bland. For dessert, I ordered the apple crumble. It was okay but not memorable. Some of my dining companions ordered the pulled pork, and not one of them finished it. They said the sauce was way too sweet, the bun was too large and the meat was just okay.   I feel like this restaurant doesn't live up to its potential at all. The staff is friendly, the location is great, and the atmosphere is lovely. The problem is their food- which, for a restaurant, is a pretty big problem."}
{"text":"I can't say the food is the best but they gain an extra star for great service. We've been there twice and both times we've had great servers. It was a little busy so they took a little longer to get to us but it was fine. I enjoyed the oysters and sauces. We ordered a kid's meal and it came out really fast. We got the fettuccine Alfredo with veggies and it was really good with no added salt. The main meals were OK. I found the seafood gumbo nothing special but good enough. I had some ravioli and it was a bit on the salty side but also OK. The creme brulee was a bit too sweet. The top was torched a bit too thick and thus making it too sweet. Its usually expected for these kinds of places. It's all about the oysters and the rest of the menu usually lacks any special quality. I don't care...I'm just glad they're pleasant enough to welcome kids which is a rare thing for a King Street restaurant to do."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the oysters but the rest of our meal was mediocre in terms of the price. Out server kept switching and felt ignored most of the time. Don't think I would come back"}
{"text":"After seeing this place on the winterlicious list, I thought I give this place a try seeing that there isnt much cajun places in toronto. Me and my gal came here on a saturday night easter long weekend and upon entering this place, it was pretty big but it was EMPTY, not even a fly flew by. It was dead in there on a saturday night and that should have raised red flags and sirens that i should leave this place IMMEDIATELY!!! but we were already here, hungry as hell and paid for parking...we ordered the alligator balls which basically looked like boneless chicken wings that tasted like chewy chicken, crab cakes that tasted and looked like president choices frozen crap cakes and the seafood platter that came with burnt bacon scallop, lobster tail, mystery fish and a whole load of shabby veggies. Oh yea by the way DO NOT ORDER THE HOUSE SPECIAL COCKTAIL DRINK. It taste like a casears mix that gone wrong as being toooooooooooo sour. The waitress was kind enough to exchange my drink for a different one. Overall this place sucks assssssss. The ambience is dark and the tables and chairs look like theyve been there since the dinosaur age. I gave this place a 2 star because the service was pretty good. Go find yourself another place unless you want to pay for high priced frozen shit which you can get at loblaws!!!!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant because it was late and it was open. We order the fixed menu.  When I came in, I was told the didn't have any oysters or that they were back up- so they weren't serving oysters.  It's an oyster bar!?  So, I ordered jambalaya, the seafood gumbo, corn bread, and the chocolate brownie dessert.  I don't know why, but I tasted raw oysters in the gumbo or something very fishy.  I also felt like it tasted like dirty water- maybe that's how it's suppose to be, but I wasn't a fan.  The jambalaya was okay. I thought Cheesecakes jambalayas were better- but that's not saying much.  The dessert and corn bread were just ok.  Considering the price and quality/taste of the food, I would prefer to go to a more food focused restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is sometimes a hit and sometimes a miss. When they use to have voodoo hours and appetizers were half off, it was great. I liked the calamari and one time I had the gumbo soup and it was delicious. However I went back and the soup was very salty. Their jambalaya rice is also soggy and not worth the price. A lot of items are overpriced and the prix fix menu choices are items that are unpopular. Staff though are always friendly and responsive. When my friend complained about her jambalaya rice they replaced it. So it's ok if you're in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"I've been to Big Daddy's many times and the food is above average, but definitely inconsistent. The first time I came here, the creole mussels were AMAZING, and rocked my world. The second time I got them, the sauce was alright but the mussels were so dry (perhaps overcooked?) and the portions were so small.   I've tried several mains (Jambalaya, Steak, Lobster Grilled Cheese to name a few), but they were all just OK, nothing special. I have heard great things about the bronzed fish, so next time I go, that is the dish that I am def going to try. I love the idea of set prix-menus and each time I've gone, I always opt for the $26 choice. The food is okay, however, the desserts are just too sweet for me. One time, the waiter noticed I barely touched my dessert and was nice enough to offer an exchange for a different dessert, but by then I was already way too full so I declined. I do commend him on his effort and superb customer service though.   The only reason I come to Big Daddy's is mainly for the oysters. If I were to rate them solely on the oysters, it would def be a 5/5 for quality! They are just perfect and come with nice horseradish and lemon, along with complementary sauces from mildly tangy to super spicy.   Overall, come for the oysters (which also won't be super cheap), but don't have too high expectations for the rest of the food."}
{"text":"Big Daddy's Bourbon was ok. Great after hour specials which was a definite plus for us. The raw oyster selection they have is pretty decent and their sauces to accompany them are good and interesting.   We had the mussels in white wine sauce which were bland and sort of a disappointment.   I will definitely go back to Big Daddy's when in Toronto but just for their raw oyster bar."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot - they have good Ceasars here, and the oysters are fresh no matter what time of day I show up at - sounds good to me.  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3.5  I'll share this rating too, since I am not too crazy about the appetizers except for the Chicken Fondue. I haven't really tried any mains, perhaps will do so next time. This spot is great for after work drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner here. The service was wonderful & the food was definitely very good. We made reservations for Thurs evening. It was not busy at all.   I think the prix fixe menu is very enticing (price & food). It was a bit difficult to narrow down the choices. In the end, we went w/ the ...  clam chowder - not the usual creamy style we are used to having. but tasty & good,  bit different & lots of clam Jambalaya (rice) - the sausage was good!  Creme Brulee - they certainly didn't cheap out on the ingredients, the surface was hard & crunchy on a nice sized plate. Could've eaten more :D  Seafood fondue (shrimp, scallops, crab and mushrooms) - so cheesy and yummy!!!! save ur bread for this.... there's too few Ciabatta & Cheddar jalapeño bread for dipping. you could get full just from eating this. Bourbon Street Crab Cakes (entree) - came w/ 3 crab cakes. they were ok. i've def. had better crab cakes somewhere but it was not bad at all. It was also served w/ creole rice (sausage & chicken) & some veggies   The service was excellent. The food came fast & everyone was polite. Definitely can't wait to be back sometime soon... Would be awesome to come here for dinner then attend a play afterwards on King Street :)"}
{"text":"Place was ranked 3 1/2 stars but was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food. Would skip the oysters next time but seafood fondue and seafood salad were excellent."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we meet here for dinner and made reservations. Our host ended up being the server since our assigned waitor was quite busy. He was great, lots of information and suggestions. We ordered an appetizer to share (bread and cheese plate), and this ended up being free with a coupon you get for joining their newsletter. We ordered from the predetermined menu. I chose popcorn shrimp, ribs with sweet potato fries and coleslaw, and mud pie for dessert. Popcorn shrimp was tasty, loved the crispy coating and the sauces. Ribs were smoky and fall-off-the-bone. Sweet potato fries were so crispy and delicious! Dessert was not like most mud pies I've had. It was more like a s'more without the graham cracker. It was ok, just not what I was expecting. Had a frozen margarita and 2 \"naughty girl\" drinks (I believe on Mondays it's double shots for $6 with cocktails and some other drinks [don't quote me on that]), both super tasty! Will definitely come back, especially on a Monday!"}
{"text":"Executive chef, Lyndon O'Hearn, creating New Orleans style deliciousness with his Louisiana-style menu.  Cornbread Bruschetta, Creole Calamari, Bronzed Catfish & Fried Alligator were all superb. Fresh oysters on the half shell are the biggest treat with all the accoutrements you could wish for - hot sauces, citrus, horseradish and the like.  Tasty tidbits on the menu are Crispy Calamari, Shrimp Crab & Chorizo Fritters, Bourbon Street Crab Cakes, Seafood Fondue, and Cajun-Fried Alligator, as well as Coconut Shrimp, all of which we raved over.  You can come in casual or dressed up for a date night dinner. They have a bar area you could come out & visit with friends, or even pop in for an after-dinner dessert.  It's always a pleasure to come visit & enjoy the cuisine from NOLA!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. I had oysters which were tiny and grilled squid which arrived on my table lukewarm, it was bland and under grilled. My friend went for their winterlicious menu which was great price (25$ for 3 courses) but food simply wasn't good. I'm glad we didn't go for more expensive options. It's an ok place to grab a bite or a drink (they have a bar you can sit at) but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a culinary experience."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a small group several weeks ago. I loved it! It's a good location, easy to get to, and easy to find if you look for the sign. Great decor, although a little dark even at lunchtime. We were greeted by the manager (we made a group reservation to be on the safe side), seated promptly, and offered beaded necklaces for Mardi Gras.  We ordered the PEI mussels for our appetizer, just to try (there's a coupon on their website for a free appetizer!), and they were pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but the white wine garlic sauce was fantastic. As my main course, I ordered the shrimp & chicken étouffée, which would have been my usual choice, but was SUCH a great decision. Amazing meal; perfectly spiced and proportioned. I would recommend it to anyone coming here. Also tried a few bites of the seafood fettucine, which was very good as well.  I didn't get our waitress' name, but she was lovely; patient, attentive, and very friendly. She was an expert on the bourbon selection! Great service, great atmosphere. Appetizers are a little pricey considering portion sizes, but the online coupon helps."}
{"text":"Went there for summerlicious and I'm planning to go back. Oyster, soup, jambalaya, and dessert were all excellent."}
{"text":"Came in because our Toronto friends insisted on drinking some \"gator bait\" before we left to go home. This place screams New Orleans to me, and the service is friendly just like the south. We sat at the bar and drank and we were able to see them shuck oysters right in front of us, pretty cool.   Didn't try the food but the menu looked tasty, will try it when we are back in town. But the \"gator bait\" drink was delicious!"}
{"text":"While vacationing in Toronto, my friend woke up craving oysters for breakfast.  Yeah, you read that right.  We turned to Yelp and found Big Daddy's within walking distance from our hotel.   We arrived just after they opened for lunch so had the restaurant all to ourselves.  I've had oysters once before, so was (and still am) clueless as to what each variation meant.  My friend apparently is an expert.  Big Daddy's has quite the selection of different types of oysters and my friend ordered a mixed dozen with three shells of four different oysters.  I ordered what I hoped would be great clam chowder; he ordered gumbo and we were going to share the oysters and crab cakes.   THE BEST CLAM CHOWDER EVER!!!!!!  Big chunks of clams swam in a wonderful broth that wasn't all cream like you find very often.  I let my friend try it and that began a war of who was going to get to eat most of it.  The gumbo was also a tasty soup that my friend tried to trade me; but didn't compare to that chowder. The crab cakes were delicious and I really enjoyed the sauce.  It had a little kick to it, but was in no way spicy hot.  One of the best crab cakes we had during our vacation (we had 6).  The oysters were really good.  Our server brought out quite a few different sauces and fresh horseradish.  It was fun to mix them and create some unique tasting little oysters.  They have definitely changed my perspective on oysters.   One thing I would've changed was where we sat.  The place was empty and we got a small two person booth.  We ordered enough food for 6 people and had to be resourceful to figure out where to place some things.  The restaurant is downstairs, so it is dark and has that New Orleans voodoo vibe to it.  If you're in the mood for Cajun style seafood, this is definitely your place."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious and had no complaints! They had good portions and their oysters bar was good too. The atmosphere was friendly and casual and they had jazz music playing... I felt like I was in new Orleans."}
{"text":"This is usually our go-to place with the girls for drinks after work.  One requirement: vodoo hours. The oysters here are incredibly fresh and well priced during the voo-doo hour specisl. Come on a monday - vodoo hour is from 5 till close which mean a late night and a hangover the next day YAY! Drink specials are good and cheap.  As far as appetizers... the coconut battered dhrimp wa statsy but arrived pretty black... it was OK... the molton cheese platter was a dissapointment. The cheese was cold and not the oozey ooey stuf fi imagined. Ive had their fondue plate shere before and the seafood one is amazing.  The wigns were OKAY...nothing crazy. The corn bread was AMAZING when leathered with lots of butter...mmm hot bread and butter. so good.  ive never ordered a main here... after eating in new orleans... i just dont think anything would suffice.  I recommend droppign by for some drinks and oysters and the corn bread... and mayeb the fondue if your hungry. everythign else was MEH."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try out Big Daddy's Bistro as part of Toronto's Summerlicious food festival.  Our reservations were a bit too early, so we called the restaurant to see if it was possible to move our reservations from 6pm to 8pm. They told us they were fully booked for the night, so all they could do was give us a thirty minute period of grace. We had to rush to get to the restaurant, but luckily we managed to get there on time. When we got there, the restaurant was nowhere near as packed as we were led to believe. We were surrounded by empty tables most of the night. Bottom line, beware of their strict reservation policy.  Once we entered the restaurant, we were asked if we had been there before. Since it was our first time at Big Daddy's, we were given a mini tour of the restaurant. The hostess was very friendly and knowledgeable. As for the ambiance, the restaurant is very nicely decorated, albeit a bit too dark. It felt like a really posh family restaurant --there were a lot of families with kids, etc, but I'm sure this was due to Summerlicious and not the usual crowd.  As soon as we sat down, our waitress came to take our order. She looked very flustered. We told her we weren't ready to order yet so she said she would give us a few minutes. A \"few minutes\" turned into a 20 minute wait. When she finally came back, we ordered the Gator Bait (house drink) and a Hurricane for drinks. Our three course menu included: (1) Coconut Shrimp and Clam Chowder (2) Two medium rare 8oz Sirloin Steaks (3) Key Lime Pie and Apple Crumble for dessert. Even though the Summerlicious menu included Mississippi Mud Pie, the waitress informed us it was no longer available. The Mud Pie was one of the reasons I wanted to try out their Summerlicious menu, so the fact that it wasn't available was very disappointing. Never promise what you can't deliver.  As for the meal, it was rather lackluster and poorly executed. The drinks were okay. The Gator Bait had a very interesting flavour, but too watered down for my taste. The Hurricane was delicious, but you can't really ruin a frozen drink. The Coconut Shrimp were very overcooked. I didn't try the Clam Chowder, but my boyfriend said it was good. The steaks were grossly overcooked: I ordered a medium rare and got medium well. The presentation for the entrees was messy and off-putting. As for the desserts, the apple crumble was cold, and the Key Lime Pie had no lime flavour to it. It tasted like a vanilla cheesecake that was left out in the sun for a few days.  All in all, I won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but one thing to note is service.  From our first experience, the server did not tell us that there were missing ingredients.  I got myself a Seafood boil, expecting Crawfish as the menu had said.  It is a $35 dish and the server mentioned it as a good choice.  When I recieved my Seafood Boil, i dug right in.  One thing i noticed was that there was no crawfish, which is the main reason i ordered it.  10 minutes into the meal, our server comes by and i tell her about.  She said that they were out of Crawfish and asked if i was a crawfish fan.  I told her that I have never eaten Crawfish but have been wanting to try it.  What surprises me is that upon ordering it, she never told me that they were out of Crawfish.    Before ordering at this restaurant, make sure to ask your server if the menu item is what it says it has.  However, you should never have to ask the server, that is their job to inform you."}
{"text":"Big Flavour at Big Daddy's  The food here is delicious! Went here on a Sunday evening to celebrate a birthday and I'm glad I did. The inside décor is very nice and I would say \"classy\" even, in a Bourbon street sort of way. They have a summerlicious menu going on right now where you can get a 3 course meal for $25, but they also have a set menu where you can choose an appetizer, a main, and a dessert for $26! So either way, you are going to get a lot of food for less than $30. I ordered the fish and chips and it was delicious. Personally I wasn't a huge fan of their coleslaw but their fries were amazing! Their seasoning is what makes them. My gf apparently doesn't even \"like\" fries. . .  but she ate half of mine!! LOL  that's how you know they were good.   As an appetizer I ordered the corn bread which was good and for dessert I ordered the bread pudding. It was good but I prefer their butter pecan tart pie i.e. my gf's choice, which yes, I ate most of      #revenge  Overall it was a great experience. We were here with a big group (around 20 ppl) so the service seemed slow but it was only because they brought everyone's order all at once!! My biggest pet peeve is when restaurants bring out half the orders and the order half of the people are left starving but trying to be polite like \"oh it's okay, you can start\". So yeah, goo don Big Daddy's to bring out all our orders at the same time. It was great.   A tip about the tip: if you go with a large group they automatically add 16% gratuity charge. On the receipt however, it's called a \"service charge\". So careful, one of my friends accidently double tipped because she didn't think tip was included lol"}
{"text":"came here recently and sat outside with a small group of people. I got the ysters for $32, for 12 oysters (2 varieties) they weren't the greatest. they didn't taste very fresh at all. and weren't shucked well. the SO got the seafood pasta, but he wasn't impressed. you can def make better pasta at home. the pasta wasn't cooked dente, it was too soft. you could tell it was dried package pasta. not the best. our server was an idiot, we were waiting 40 minutes when i called the server over to ask about our desserts. she was like \"oh you guys want those?\" and turned around. she also took forever to get a plate and was pretty rude. maybe she was having an off day. the staff inside seemed nicer, but it def wasn't as busy as the patio. overall, i was disappointed with the oysters, food and service here. i remember all 3 being great a few years ago. i used to love the voodoo hours as well, but i've notice a decline in the quality of those oysters in the last year or so as well.  shame."}
{"text":"Nice place. Lucky, we ordered some oysters to sample. Very nice and worth it.  The main entree on the other hand, seafood fettuccine, was good but mediocre still. Did not enjoy the service, but nice atmosphere. Not bad, I might come again just to have some more oysters!!"}
{"text":"I went here on Friday and got a patio table.  It was a cozy area facing Roy Thomson Hall.  The waitress was friendly and recommended the special which was Tilapia.  We ordered some drinks which we quickly received and ordered a calimari and the Tilapia.  The Calimari was great!  It was slightly breaded with a soft texture, it was fresh.  The Tilapia was good, but seasoned a bit too salty.  I walked inside to use the washroom and it was very busy.  All in all it is a nice place to dine."}
{"text":"It was ok.  I was in town for work and my Canadian counterparts took me here without knowing that I'm from Louisiana.  So, that was weird.  Taking me to a New Orleans themed place.  But, the food was ok, nothing earth shaking, but everything was decent.  I didn't care for the crab cakes, but the  lobster fondue was pretty tasty and definitely NOT a New Orleans thing.  The Ahi tuna app as good too.  My scallops were not fabulous, but I've had worse."}
{"text":"Looking for a patio to hang out on a hot Summer day? Stop by Big Daddy's. They have a neat little (seriously little) patio with cool drinks and oysters to freshen you up.  Their menu is not bad either.... My friends and I ordered the Mixed Platter which consists of scalops, shrimps and a crab leg with a side of creole rice.... Quite tasty!!!   We also ordered scampis à la Créole, Cajan Fried Alligator and Jambalaya rice. Starvation central, you say?!? Not just a little!!!! The food was deeeelicious, not just because we were starving but really yummmza!!! The alligator meat itself is practically tasteless hence more batter than meat, but it's worth trying....  After a big meal, we could only try one dessert on the menu - the molten chocolate brownie. It was a-ok!!"}
{"text":"Your challenge number one would be to find the entrance. First time I've been there I was like: \"Ehm... so... all the way down, than on the right, downstairs, and on the left, eh?\" But when you'll get in it actually looks pretty cool. New-orleanish design with fake windows and so on. Not bad at all, just cheap - strange, taking in account all those theatres and classy public around.  Seafood is good. Crabs are maybe not as exciting as you can expect from the name of the place, but they are ok, too. I've tried about half-dozen different plates there, never to be disappointed. Maybe it's just me but at times I was feeling like I am scrolling back and forth through the menu and still choosing the same thing I've already eaten before. Not that it's not much to choose from, but it feels like that.  Portions are ok, wine selection is more cute than impressive, but good enough for the food. Prices are right and service is decent. I never hesitate to visit Big Daddy's Crabshack again, even though I'm falling short to give it four stars. Maybe something like 3.5?"}
{"text":"I was finally able to visit again -and during a weekday voodoo hour!!  *******Voodoo hours******* Sun & Mon: 3:00pm - 11:00pm Tue-Fri: 3:00pm - 6:00pm & 10:00pm - midnight  Which meant you can order any appetizers for $2 less.   Here's one I enjoyed: Cajun-Fried Alligator (regular $12, voodoo $10)  ALLIGATOR!! Where else can you eat alligator???   The alligator meat was cut up into bite-size pieces, covered with the sauce so you could barely taste the raw meat. It's also very very chewy!  I actually REALLY like this dish NOT because of the alligator. The Creole sauce and rice was amazing!!! I was scraping off every bit of rice from the plate!   Unfortunately other dishes we had were only adequate (in fact, disappointing). AND I expected the mussels to be fresh, but they weren't!   I love the decor and vibe here! Service is alright. I guess my 3 stars rating is because of the prices for the average food."}
{"text":"Our party of three came in for Dinner specifically to try out the prix menu. The restaurant is pretty large with a kitchy bar in the front and the dining rooms toward the back. Decor wise it has a bit of a dated feel to it but maybe its suppose to evoke that new orleans old french quarter era. We were seated in a booth towards the back of the restaurant with a bright a red table.  Our waiter for the evening Pat was super friendly and attentive all night long. He went over the specials for evenings and helped make recommendations. The menu basically consists of southern creole style food with predominately seafood dishes. We were all going to order the 3 course prix fix meal however we also ordered some additional apps off the regular menu.  Bourbon Street Crab Cakes - Made in-house with blue crab meat, topped with a roasted red pepper cream sauce Loved the spicy sauce accompanying the crab cake, the crab was also very delicious but not the best i've ever had.  Corn Bread - I found the outside of the cornbread a little dense and chewy but the inside soft and not overly sweet with pieces of real corn inside  Onto the 3 Course Prix Fix... Appetizers (we all ordered a different app to share)  Calamari - w/ house-made cocktail sauce Lightly battered cooked perfectly nice spicy cocktail sauce    PEI Mussels w/ grilled bread Flavourful garlicy tomato sauce w/ tender mussels and nice toasty bread to soak up the sauce  Seafood Gumbo - A classic, hearty Louisiana-style soup with shrimp, crab & oysters Very flavourful and rich broth with good chunks of seafood  Mains   Bronzed Fish of the Day - Skillet-seared with house spices, served with Creole-style rice (with chorizo sausage & chicken) and seasonal vegetables The fish of the day was tilapia which is my favourite fish! It was cooked perfectly, loved the seasoning and the Creole style rice was perfection!    Shrimp & Bronzed Chicken Étouffée - A popular Cajun rice dish with bronzed chicken and shrimp in a traditional rich tomato & pepper saffron gravy I can totally see why this is soo popular this was a phenomenal dish! The flavours OMG amazingg loved that decadent saffron gravy, tons of meat and the rice tasted soo delicious and buttery absorbing all the rich broth. I definitely recommend this!  Desserts    Bourbon Street Bread Pudding - A New Orleans classic! Served with vanilla ice cream and whiskey sauce. I'm not a fan of bread pudding but everyone who ordered this devoured it So i take it was very good.  Sweet Treat Peanut Butter Cupcake I went with our waiter's suggestion and it was delicious! A chocolate cake topped with a thick cold peanut butter frosting and a mini peanut butter cup!  Overall a Fantastic Meal! Portions were large and everything came out hot, fresh, and very flavourful! Service from our waiter Pat was the best we could have asked for. We all left completely stuffed and overly satisfied! Definitely go for the 3 course prix fix ($26 or $31 for premium entrees) it's totally worth it!"}
