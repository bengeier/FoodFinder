{"text":"I have been hearing great things about this place since they opened and I finally tried it tonight and holy cow, it definitely lived up to the hype. The owner is v nice and even tho he was about to close when I popped in, he gave me the burrito he just made for himself, claiming it would be one of the best burritos I've ever had. I lived in Arizona for a while so my standards are high, but he wasn't toying with me. It was easily the best burrito I've had in Pittsburgh and possibly one of the best I've ever had. Not to mention the hot sauce was amazing. (Side note to owner: please open for breakfast, I've been craving a good breakfast burrito)"}
{"text":"I can't speak to the food yet. I've been wanting to try this place for many weeks and tonight I braved the rain and miserable weather just to try this place for dinner. Closed. Dark. No sign except the sign saying they open for dinner on Saturday at 5:00. Nothing on the website either (which I checked before driving across town on this fruitless adventure). I'm very disappointed. At least post a sign or something if you aren't going to open during advertised hours!"}
{"text":"Okay so I have eaten at the majority of taco joints in Pittsburgh, and I love tacos. But this place is amazing. Their tacos are definitely some of the best I have ever had, if not the best, but on top of that they are super friendly and consistent which puts them on top of everyone else for me. It feels like you are eating at someone's family's house. I love this place."}
{"text":"20/10!!!!!!  I loved their spicy brisket taco Owner and staff very nice and welcoming!"}
{"text":"I've anxiously awaited the arrival of Baby Loves Taco in Bloomfield for the past few months... and it was even better than I imagined! The ingredients are fresh, the tacos are creative and plentiful, and the owner is awesome. What more can you ask for?? We will be back regularly. With empty bellies!"}
{"text":"Nicest people, amazing food. Out of the approximately 1032 times we have eaten here, not a single thing has been disappointing or anything but top-notch. And as a parent, I really apppreciate the name of the restaurant and the fact that kids eat free. Why are you still reading this? Go get some tacos from BLT!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Nice guys very accommodating. I loved the buffalo cauliflower taco nice and spicy. I will be back to try the burrito."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos; tried the bbq mushroom, chorizo, brisket, and chicken - all very good. 

They're just starting out and are already miles above everything else. It's so hard to find good Mexican food here, but not anymore"}
{"text":"First time visiting this spot!  Friendly service, quick, fresh ingredients, and nicely favored. Had the BBQ Mushroom, Chicken, and Roasted rosemary potato (special) tacos - all delicious. 3 for $10."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food is mouth watering, the staff is amazingly kind, and Zack the owner is such a kind hearted person, les kids eat on him, I go there regularly and I didn't even realize I used to play soccer with him till he turned his back and I saw him. I come here literally 2 to 4 times a week. And I'm writing this review because I can't get enough of this place and other people deserve to know just how amazing it is. Thanks Zack I appreciate you"}
{"text":"Freaking awesome. So happy to have this place like 500 feet from my house. 

Stopped in on a hot night for the pop-up and was not disappointed. Tried one fish taco, one beef and one chicken. Every one was amazing with the perfect amount of spice. The fish was the best -- next time I would get all three as fish. Fresh, no fishy-taste and perfectly fried. The toppings just made it even better. 

The owner, Zach is awesome and really friendly. You can also tell he is working so hard -- when we were there he was doing it all and still making conversation with everyone that came in. I'm excited for this place to officially open but at the same time I don't want the secret to get out too much! 

Reasonably priced, delicious, quick and close by -- I'll be back a lot!"}
{"text":"That was the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. I thought long and hard about if that's true or not, and it totally is."}
{"text":"This place is so much better than Chipotle. Just tried it for the first time today and loved the tacos! The guys working were really cool too. I definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The kind of place where you plan your next visit before you even leave. Passionate chef, delicious food. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great menu, the buffalo cauliflower taco is an off-the-wall smash. I suggest trying it all"}
{"text":"Location: 1.5/10. The entire establishment is about the size of a large office cubicle. Standing room only with a little bar top type area where you can eat. I went with the take out route since I like sitting and eating. One thing that sucks is that there isn't a nice park nearby where you could eat outside in the summer months. 
Price: 7/10. For 10$ you get three large tacos that are densely packed. Pretty good bang for your buck.
Appearance of the Taco: 4/10. Let's just say these tacos look far from gourmet but I've seen worse. You can judge for yourself from the picture.
Taste: 5/10. This is where I was extremely disappointed, after following them on Instagram I saw that over the last week they have continuously sold out of tacos like they were tacos from the gods. I honestly didn't think they were that good. They were large and Densely packed but the taste just wasn't there. The best part was the hot sauce that I had asked for. If it wasn't for the hot sauce I think it would of fallen in the 3.5 out of 10 range. One note, I do love the addition of the lime. Like the little citrus kick there. 
Overall rating: 5/10. 
Would I go back yes, would I go out of my way to go back, no I would not. Maybe I am spoiled when it comes to tacos but it just wasn't there for me. The hype did not live up to the actual thing. As it stands the best tacos in the city of Pittsburgh in order: 1. Tako 2. Smoke 3. Bakersfield 4. Condados 5. Baby loves tacos 6. Doce taqueria."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh. BLT is still in the \"soft open\" phase, but you wouldn't know it by trying their food. Their hours are just 6-9pm on weekdays as far as I can tell, but you should definitely stop by and give them a shot. Once they have a hard open, they'll be swamped."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch later in the afternoon and it wasn't crowded. Very brightly colored place with lots of sunlight. The menu wasn't overwhelming, yet still had many options that felt like you could truly get a unique taco, salad, or bowl.
We decided to get the three taco deal (can't remember how much, but it was a reasonable price). There were tons of options for the meat and you could load it up with all kinds of toppings.
The tacos were absolutely fantastic. They must put a hint of Chipotle sauce in the taco, but it really added the perfect flavor to the brisket and the chicken.
Highly recommend. I must also mention that Kat was very friendly, shared the story of the place, and helped us order the perfect taco. Thanks!"}
{"text":"i got a rice bowl and there wasn't anything special about it. i got the buffalo cauliflower which was definitely a good choice - very different than what i've had before and it was very good! the rice bowl was mostly rice and it was uncooked... it would have been better if there was more of the other stuff. the worker was very nice and helpful though and they made the guac spicy which i also liked!"}
{"text":"Outstanding joint all around. My favorite part is their rice and beans - like wow - usually that stuff is just filler, but here, it's often times the highlight of the burrito for me; it's tender, flavorful, savory *muah*. The protein is always yummy too and the vibe is  Owner is great - funny and friendly. Rest of the food is good all around."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing up Baby Loves Tacos on social media for months... today I finally got myself there to try! (It was the buffalo cauliflower taco that pushed me over the edge to drive to Bloomfield!)

The small shop doesn't offer seats but has some standing area to enjoy your tacos. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower and a chicken taco to try two different kinds (tacos are 3 for $10 or 1 for $4). Both were very good! While ordering I heard my two favorite questions... \"Do you want guac? and Would you like it spicy?\" Yes and YES! 

The quick trip was worth it - they were spicy, flavored well, and the cauliflower was a great change! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"It isn't a traditional taco place and more of an interpretation of filling tacos. Don't expect a taqueria and think more fusion. We stopped in to get three tacos each. The fillings were slow cooked with care, pronounced flavors and great blend of ingredients. 

The tacos are quote large. You can definitely eat two and be full. 

Tip, not much seating, just grab and go for optimal enjoyment. Vegetarian options are available."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and burritos here. I had a chicken, brisket, and the vegetable of the day - sweet potato with feta and almonds. They were all amazing. Both my brother and boyfriend got spicy brisket burritos and they loved them! The owner and staff are also very friendly, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"So much flavor! Doesn't matter what you order because it's always phenomenal. Owner is super awesome as well!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about Baby Loves Tacos so I was very excited to finally try. Upon arrival, we discovered that there weren't any tables so we ordered to go. I had the brisket, chicken, and chorizo tacos. My partner in crime had two vegetable tacos; which She liked. They were very tasty and the prices were good. The venue doesn't really have seating but you can stand and eat at the window. I look forward to coming back for the buffalo cauliflower and barbecue mushroom tacos. The service was fast and friendly. The brisket was my favorite so far. I give it a 4.5 and my co-diner gave it a 3.5.

Upon further review of a second trip, I have to bump my score up to a 5.0. The tacos were even better this time."}
{"text":"Love love love Baby Loves Tacos.

I can't imagine a hipper place.  No place to sit, order your tacos and either take out or there is space for about eight people to stand and munch.  I don't know why anyone would mind that when the tacos are so good.

There are only six tacos to choose from, and I always think that when a shop makes a choice to limit a menu that way it's brave but really smart.  Brave, because of all the people who think they need more choices.  Those people are missing out because a limited menu allows the chef to really lean in and excel on a smaller list.  And sure enough, each of the tacos that came out were exceptional. 

I had a chorizo, brisket, and barbecued mushroom.  They all were great but I have to say the mushroom taco flavors simply exploded for me.  The veggie options all looked incredible.  Baby Loves Tacos is really one of the more vegetarian friendly places around--50% of the offerings were veggie.  Respect.

Baby Loves Tacos is worth an extended trip to get there.  Don't let this pass you but.  Support Baby Loves Tacos!

PS. how can this be rated $$?  Three tacos that fill you up for $10.  That is a deal."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood. Five stars for great fresh Mexican and awesome friendly service. Love the spicy brisket burrito!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in the burgh. You can bring both veg heads and picky meat eaters here and they will leave with a super satisfying food baby. It's more of a grab and go style joint so get yourself some tacos then go for a stroll in Schenley, if you can wait long enough to devour them that is"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Really unique and much needed taco place in Pittsburgh. Can't wait for it to officially open. The BLT taco is unreal"}
{"text":"I had BLT tonight at an offsite event. The tacos were PAY WHAT YOU CAN $$!! So cool. I am a vegetarian and enjoyed one of the buffalo cauliflower tacos and one potato and poblano. Both were out of this world! Wow! Thank you!"}
{"text":"These tacos are amazing!!! Apparently the've only \"soft\" opened and their full opening is coming. Don't be discouraged when the sign outside says \"Jim's wraps and salads\". 

I had one brisket and one bacon taco. Neither of these meats are traditional, but the taco style (double corn tortilla, cilantro, salsa, lime) was. I AM STILL THINKING ABOUT THE BACON TACO and my only regret was not ordering 2 of those along with the brisket. If you're hungry, I suggest you order 3 tacos. The tortillas were super delicious, and tasted fresher/softer than normal corn tortillas-- I'd love to know where they get them. 

The owner is very kind and informative. He even told me to \"pay what I want\" and when I said $10 for two tacos (which I thought was reasonable) he only charged me $6 for the two.

I can't wait to come back and bring my friends!"}
{"text":"Best taco I've had in my entire life. And I've eaten a lot of tacos. I had the buffalo cauliflower taco- the soft corn tortilla shell is unlike any other taco shell at any other taco joint. Also got the ground beef rice bowl which was full of flavor and the meat was tender, lean, and flavorful. Also incredibly fast service. Five stars"}
{"text":"This place is great- everything is always so delicious and fresh and the portions are pretty filling, especially the burritos. I also appreciate how hands on the owner is- he genuinely cares about his customers and it shows every time I'm there( which is pretty often). The buffalo cauliflower is my favorite and their hot sauce is amazing. It's pretty hot though, so I make sure to get it on the side. This place is worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"A fantastic spot! The owner seems super passionate and makes amazing tacos! Strongly suggest the beef and chorizo tacos! Can't wait for the full opening!"}
{"text":"This little neighborhood place doesn't even have a sign yet, and the hours are irregular. But don't let that stop you. My zucchini and cauliflower soft tacos were absolutely amazing---flavorful and delicious. They compare well to tacos I've had in bigger cities and fancier restaurants. Last bite was as good as the first, and left me hungry for more. We will definitely be back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I'm really not a taco person (que the freakout). Idk I just need more, aka pizza. But I still enjoy a good taco when I find it. And I found it. They were at an event I was attending and so I grabbed a beef and a fish taco. Coming from someone who hasnt had a ton of tacos, I thought they were incredible. My issue is that the place isn't really open, it's sort of open but not and a lot of times they say they will be fully open soon, but then soon comes and it's still not really open. That's the only reason I went down a star."}
{"text":"There are many things to love about BLT, but the first is not even about their tacos (which are amazing). The first time I came into the shop-- it's located inside Jim's Wraps and Salads in Bloomfield-- I was greeted warmly by Steve, who runs the counter and genuinely connects with everyone walking into the place, asking their names and learning more about how they found out about BLT. He also recalls the regulars by name and helps promote a sense that this is a neighborhood restaurant that cares about its patrons. It's personal touches like these that set BLT apart and truly embody the essence of \"Pittsburgh nice\" (which is totally a thing). 

I ordered a chicken taco and a side of guac and chips, and all were completely delicious and had the authentic Mexican flavor I was hoping for. My only reasoning for not giving it a full 5 stars is due to the wait, since it's a small set-up and during peak hours-- I went right after 6pm when it had opened-- lots of people are waiting for their tacos to be prepared by Zach, and this can take nearly 20 minutes. On the flip side, Steve is there to talk with everyone who comes in and helps you forget about the wait time entirely!

The shop runs on a donation basis, if paying with cash, or you can use a card and indicate how much you are paying. I love this idea and feel like it again embodies the sense of it being a family-style neighborhood staple that you want to be generous towards in order to keep it going."}
{"text":"First visit to BLT.  Mostly take out but there is a little space to stand at the counter. We will be back!  Six different fillers for tacos, burritos, bowls or salads. Very fresh, very restricted diet friendly IMHO. Easy to go gluten free or veg but don't know about strict allergy limitations. Super friendly atmosphere and quick service at 7:30 pm Wednesday. Hubby had the chicken and brisket tacos; I had the spicy! Chorizo, cauliflower and mushroom ones. Mushrooms were my favorites for sure. Easy public parking for a dollar on Taylor St one block up (take a left at the light from Liberty driving away from downtown Pittsburgh). Guacamole w chips a nice way to wait the few minutes for your food. Add to your order!"}
{"text":"Loved the huevos rancheros, the brisket chili, the arroz con gandules and pernil for PR fundraiser."}
{"text":"We have followed the Baby Loves Tacos Instagram account for a while now, and finally got to try. 

The staff was very friendly when we entered and helped us right away. We came during brunch, so they were offering breakfast tacos/burritos. We ordered burritos with bacon. We were offered OJ \"with a twist,\" meaning they added mineral water to the juice. 

The breakfast burritos were really good and huge! They were filled with cheese, beans, potatoes, and pico. They came out quickly and were very filling. I would definitely go back!

It was clear that this place has tons of regulars already as many other customers were greeted by name. The staff was willing to explain anything and were very attentive. 

While we were there we learned that they are still in their soft opening phase- so they are running on donations. They accept cash or card."}
{"text":"I'd heard the rumors. Baby Loves Tacos came back home from Philadelphia and had been setting up a pop-up for a while. \"You have to go check it out.\" \"It's worth the drive for such a legit taco.\" \"I've been craving Baby Loves Tacos for weeks since I last had it.\"

The rumors are true and Baby Loves Tacos lives up to the hype. You have to go check it out. It's worth the drive for such a legit taco. And, since trying it for the first time last week, I've been craving Baby Loves Tacos ever since.

We stopped in for the soft opening, and everything blew us away--we were particularly impressed by the sweet potato taco. The full menu will have burritos and bowls and most of my paycheck. Bloomfield is a great place for Italian flare, but an even better place for Baby Loves Tacos. As an added bonus, Zack is passionate and super nice and humble about how awesome his food is.

There are tons of places in the city to hop on the new taco craze, but there's only one Baby Loves Tacos. And Baby Loves Tacos is drivin' me crazy."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the Burgh! I'm from Chicago so my taco standards are pretty high. This place is amazing. Always fresh, generous portions. Awesome staff. Seating is limited to a counter so it's really a take it to go kinda place."}
{"text":"Not enough can be said about Baby Loves Tacos. This location doesn't have seating, it's hot on the inside, but the service is incredible (the nicest people you'll ever meet) and the food was solid. Tacos, burritos, bowls and salads are the essence of this establishment and if you're in to some tasty Mexican food with American flash, get there sooner than later."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos. A fun little spot that can get crowded. There's no seating, more of a grab and go but the tacos are great! I'd definitely recommend the spicy brisket. I could eat three of those. I've also tried the bbq mushroom and the chicken, both had great flavor. It doesn't get better than $10 for 3 tacos. Definitely kept me full."}
{"text":"I've been very excited to try this place out after following their journey on Facebook. We ordered takeout for a group of 7, lots of different preferences with toppings, etc. Everything was correct, and they took the time to label the check and each meal with corresponding numbers so we could easily figure out which meals belonged to whom and how much money we owed. Specifically enjoyed the brisket taco and the hot sauce is incredible! Can't wait to make this a regular takeout spot and I'm so happy Bloomfield has a taco place!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Bloomfield for two years now and have always hoped for a good taco place to move in. I was thrilled to hear one was moving into the space previously occupied by Jim's Wraps and Salads, which didn't last long. I stopped by one of their soft openings with my boyfriend and we got the chorizo and pulled pork tacos. They were fantastic. The pork had such a nice complex flavor with cumin and cinammon, with nice big slices of avocado. The chorizo was bright red and full of flavor, perfectly spicy all on corn tortillas. The owner was very nice and I like how he fixed the place up, knowing what it used to be. We will be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"I love the concept and the food. I like that the spot is fun and easy to get to. The owner Zach is funny and following his instagram really makes me want tacos every day of the week. I will say that I wish there were stools by the window ledge. I like the stand and eat feel but if this is going to happen can we get some hooks under the ledge for my purse. It just was weighing me down and I would have liked to be able to move just a bit more and take up less ledge space by plopping it down next to me. 

They are not truly open yet but I look forward to them being 100% ready and up and running. Everything I have tried has been awesome. I cannot wait to taste more of the menu as Zach changes it per week. 

Also as per my usual taco complaints this place ACTUALLY uses corn tortillas. I love it! Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Man, this Baby Loves Tacos and the tacos at Baby Loves Tacos.  Have stopped by in the past but they were not open at the time I stopped due to just starting up and not having consistent hours during soft opening.  Finally open hours are listed on the website.  Yea!  
Also, finally have signage.  
Tried the 3 for $10 taco option.  Can't go wrong with any.  The Spicy Brisket just came out of the oven and was perfect.  The Chorizo was also tasty with a nice spicy flavor. The chicken was good but not as spicy.  If you are in the area and looking for a fast meal and tacos you should definitely stop in.  The tacos come with salsa, cilantro, lime, fresh tomato and you can get gauc."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, adorable decor, and really great and friendly owner. It'll be a weekly taco spot for me."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while as I am always on the lookout for the best tacos in the burgh. Even though it was raining out, there was a line for their tacos. I did the 3 for $10 and had the buffalo cauliflower, chorizo, and chicken with guac. Their menu is pretty limited, but with the amount of people there I knew it had to be good. There is no seating, but my friend and I were able to grab some space at the standing counter area. The decor of the place is cute with a lot of succulents and candles giving it a warm homey vibe. 

The tacos were delicious. I love corn tortillas, so I was happy that their tacos each come with two corn tortillas. They load up the tacos with toppings such as salsas and cheese and give lime on the side. The buffalo cauliflower had a nice kick to it which I was not expecting. The chorizo was on the oily side, but tasty. After three tacos, I was pretty full. A perk was that the guac was no extra cost. Overall, a great place to grab some quality tacos. You truly can never have enough tacos. I will definitely be back to try some different proteins!"}
{"text":"Baby Loves Tacos is now officially open. They opened 1-9-18. The only way I recognized the place was that they had a small folded sign near the door. They are in the process of changing the overhead sign.

When I went in I met Ryan the owner and asked him about that closure of the business I read in the paper about a week or so ago. He explained to me that matter had to do with an occupancy permit and there are no health violations associated with this business.

This place is basically a take out but they have a counter where you can stand if you prefer to eat in. I learned that they do catering both private and corporate. The menu isn't expansive but the prices are reasonable.

Ryan explained to me that everything except the burritos are gluten free and if you are a vegan, upon request, they can turn their vegetable taco into vegan. He suggested that I try 3 different tacos for my first visit. I went with the spicy brisket, the chicken, and the buffalo cauliflower. For my drink I ended up with a \"lime aid.\" Needless to say it was very good.

I got my food fairly quickly and then I noticed how many people poured in here just for lunch! These tacos were very good. The brisket was just a little tough but otherwise I enjoyed them. Let me also mention they were messy so I was grateful that they gave me plenty of napkins. It should be noted that under the main counter they have hooks where you can hang your purse. Made it convenient for me so I wouldn't mess it up while eating.  I wasn't at the window counter so I can't speak for that one.

Although they have other offering including salads you have your choice of the same five meats or vegetables to choose from. I was glad to have found this place. It is located on Liberty Ave in Bloomfield near Tessaro's. Paid metered parking is available or off street day parking if you are lucky to find it is available as well.

I was told they are open weekdays for lunch and dinner only. They are closed on Suns. Looking forward to trying out their other offerings on a future visit. Good food and great service!!"}
{"text":"This absolutely breaks my heart.  I wanted to love this place.  I was born and raised in central California, so I basically have hot sauce for blood and I'm sure at least one organ is actually a burrito.  Here's how my experience went down. 

Reading the wall menu, the dude at the counter becomes obviously annoyed at me not knowing immediately what I wanted.  (Awesome.)  I ask what the veggie special is and he points to another sign. 
HEY PITTSBURGH, USE YOUR DAMN WORDS. 

I forget that it's really cool to be uppity for no reason around here, so I move on.  I blurt out something resembling an order and wait. 

I dive into the burrito in my car because I just got off a 13 hour shift and damn it, I deserve a car burrito. 

Bite one. HOLY.  %*$@!!  This is the best tortilla I have had since leaving CA.  I'm getting really pumped.  Next bite.  WOOOAH this Smokey hot sauce is damn good, DAMN GOOD.  Third bite. Plain white rice.  Ok odd choice whatever.  \"BBQ mushroom\"...crunch.  Ouch.  Mushrooms shouldn't have mega crunchy parts. 

No extra charge for guac...because it tastes like green water.  The only positives were the tortilla and the chipotle hot sauce.  The rest was incredibly disappointing. 

I'll deal with uppity people in the food world if the product is damn good.  I thought I'd give it another shot, but the fact of me running to the toilet as soon as I got home is going to prevent that from happening."}
{"text":"The veggie special sweet potato taco  loved the ambiance and neighborhood rapport. Treats you like family***** what a community spot. New favorite."}
{"text":"I'm so glad Bloomfield is now home to Baby Loves Tacos. 
They're open limited hours until occupancy license and other red tape is cleared.
I left a tip that the hours now are Tuesday 6-9pm. It's actually daily unless shop is closed to work an event.
Definitely a take away joint but there's counter seating for three. It's a small walkup space and that's a-ok with me.
Decor is fun and makes me feel like I'm in the chef's personal kitchen.
So on this visit we had tacos. Next up for us will be bowls, salads, burritos and chips/salsa.
I had the chicken taco, Brian had a mushroom taco and a fish taco and we shared one made of chorizo.
This food absolutely blew us away!!! So delish, you guys!
I love that we were asked if we liked our food spicy and when we said yes just the right amount of hot sauce was added for the perfect kick.
My chicken taco came with avocado, homemade pico, cheese, and cilantro. Mushroom taco had barbecued mushrooms and cheese. Fish taco came with a creamy chipotle sauce, pickled cabbage and avocado. Chorizo had cheese, pico, avocado, cilantro.
All served on corn tortillas.
Reasonably priced-comparable to other local taco spots. 
I sat there literally getting dizzy and my head was spinning because the flavors were that overwhelming tasteful. It was difficult stopping myself from ordering more.
The owner/chef and his mom are super nice, friendly and we got to talk about the business he had in Philly and all he plans to do here---he's opening a place in Bellevue too.
Definitely worth checking out. Trust me."}
{"text":"Very friendly folks running the place.  However I wasn't a big fan of the tacos.  I ordered a brisket taco and I swear the chef must have used a whole jar of chili powder to cook the meat.  That was the only thing I could taste in the taco.  It was overpowering. 

Maybe the chicken or veggie would be a better option next time.  As one of the few counter service places in Bloomfield I'm willing to give it another try.  But steer clear of the brisket unless you like your meat extremely (and I mean extremely) seasoned"}
