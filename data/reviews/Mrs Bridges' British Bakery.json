{"text":"I post this by way of a public service.  I went off Xmas shopping for a British partner who had recently waxed nostalgic.  Among many purchases was a steak pie and a half dozen fern tarts.  The pie was, well...just dreadful.  We followed the heat up directions to the letter but at first bite, it became clear that the pastry was off (mildly sodden) and the alleged steak was inedibly salty.  I soldiered through my piece and my partner refused (wise move as I felt somewhat sick all evening with a sort of m.s.g. headachy buzz).  The tarts turned out to be museum pieces--so dry inside that it took quite a manly chomp to crack through.  Worried about the chocolate stocking stuffers I got, I broke into one pack this morning and discovered that, although they were within the expiry date, they had been improperly stored and had melted and resolidified with truly unappetizing consequences.  As my partner said, there's a reason Britain is going down the tubes.  And btw, this place is not cheap.  I'm still in shock."}
{"text":"Aside from looking at my Canadian Money everyday, that's if there's any left in my wallet if my Friend's don't dry me up first.  I barely recollect that modern day Canada has a British heritage and a prior Colony.  Looking upon this popular walk-in shop, it felt like I was a Tourist to London and no longer on Canadian soil.

Breads, Pastries, Desserts near the front counter which are still recognizable as such however with names that might sound unlike your daily consumables.  Bannock - Irish Style, Irish Style Baps, Scottish Style Wholewheat Bread, Loafs, etc...

Quality Meat Shoppe more like a couple Fridge with Meat Pies, Sausages, and Haggis.  Not one of the limited fullscale Butcher in Scarborough that provide Haggis but still handy in case of Haggis emergencies.

Imported Sweets pretty much take up 1/2 the shop floor from Fruit Gums and Fudges to Toffees and Chocolates.  It's not what you can typical find in your local convenient store.

Tip: As most of these are imports and not everything is popular, please check the expiry date prior to purchase.  I couldn't even read the date on the 18 month barrel-aged Worcestershire.

Did you know Heinz makes Microwaveable Spotted Dick Pudding?  
Just look up their website: http://www.bestbritishfoods.com/index.cfm

It's a small shop but definitely FUN to explore for culinary people or others curious of the British culture.  No Queens were harmed during this reviewing."}
{"text":"We bought six Frys chocolate bars this past weekend. When I opened them they had a white film on them and the filling had chrystalized. Yuck! Looked at the 'best before' date (too late, i know!) and it was August 2012. We bought them on October 6, 2012. Are you telling me that no one has checked the stock in 2 months?? We will not be returning. If you do visit, be sure to check the expiry dates BEFORE you purchase."}
{"text":"Since Mark and Spencer left Canada, I have not seen any  place like Mrs Bridges' British that carries all the British treats, condiments and anything that you can think of that you can eat that is British!

Frozen Haggies in all sizes.. Yorkshire meat pie... Irish bread... Scotland bread...shortcakes... fruit jams..and more!

Oh those Rowntree's fruit gum and pastilles , Polo mints really bring back childhood memory.. my favourite English candies when I used to eat all the time....

Prices on the pricey side compare to getting local products but think of they are all shipped from overseas and how high the GBP are!"}
{"text":"Wow. Went in the store and never have we been treated so poorly. The woman was rude and downright unhelpful. If this place had the very last morsel of food on the face of the planet I still would NOT buy anything.
On top of that, shelves were bare and atmosphere was awful. Don't waste your time, there are much better places to get your British goods in the city with much friendlier owners/staff!"}
