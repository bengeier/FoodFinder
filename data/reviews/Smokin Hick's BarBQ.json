{"text":"Great name.   God awful food.  Had a basic sandwich. Cold stale bun slopped with sticky sickly sweet leftover pork something.  Steer clear of this offense.  Will come again to give these guys a second chance.  Stay tuned.  Guess not, they closed."}
{"text":"Good smoked meat. Have tried the chicken, pulled pork and beef brisket and have to say the pulled pork wins.  Great food. Ambiance sucks quite frankly and they could stand to mop their floors once in a while. Still when I've got a hankering for some protein, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Living out here in Southwest Scarboro is now a bigger plus since these guys moved in. When I tasted their yummy BarBQ I was positively tickled pink. We ordered the meal deal Beef Brisket and Pulled Pork for 4 and it was all delish. We tried four different sauces - all good. Only the biscuits disappointed as they were somewhat underbaked (but tasty toasted for breakfast the next morning!) Very friendly helpful service. Apparently eating on the premises awaits approval from City bureaucrats - get on it guys!"}
{"text":"I personally enjoyed eating BBQ here, but what-the-hick would I know? I don't smoke.  I'm not a hick.  I'm not a smokin bbqin' hick.  Take-out means the interior of my car gets to indulge in the aroma's of Hickory and Meat.  Feel the rub texture of the Ribs.  Slide with the liquidity of South Carolina Vinegar/Pepper Sauce.  Lubricate from the Brisket oils.  Lucky to be my car ain't it?   3.5'd  There's still little things that made it less perfect and those would be:  -Room temp Buttermilk Biscuit(good flavour but could be better warmed) -Beef Brisket was in pull/shredd form losing natural juice holding ability  You know the annual Scarb Ribfest at Thomson Park?  Well, now Scarberians don't need to wait that long for RIBS.  You'll still have to wait annually for the stage music, crowds and unorganized line-ups unfortunately."}
{"text":"Smokin hicks seems to have gone out of business. Too bad but not a total surprise. The bbq was good but sides were ho-hum and the resto was often a mess."}
{"text":"Love love their BBQ here.. Its Scarborough little hidden gem.. Great quality and amount of food for the price you pay here.."}
{"text":"So what am I doing when I am not on a Hot \"Yoga\" Date practising yoga and be Zen or eating Ethiopian veggie platter like baby food?...ommommmm   I am feasting on Meat! To be precise Smoking Hick's BarBQ of Ribs, Pulled Pork and Beef Briskets.. done their way.. which definitely better than my way..   Smokin Hick's BarBQ is straightly a takeout joint... as the interior is set up in a way that you know you have no option but take it somewhere else to eat.. no tables... just bare walls...and the food your ordered would be all packed to go.. but where to eat?   1/2 Rib and Beef Brisket ($16.25) with South Carolina Vinegar and Pepper Sauce choice of side and a buttermilk biscuit  - Just sinful to look at how the beef brisket is soaked in oil and sauce... sinfully delicious.. as it is soft and tender..  - When I opened up the box to see this huge dried looking rib.. I felt like whining and complaining..but trust me, it was just cooked perfectly.. as I rip the ribs apart with my bare hands...  - the sauce which is sour and tangy compliment the heaviness of the protein.. while I watch my yelp buddy dipping every single ribs and enjoying the flavour..   The Smokin Hick Pulled Pork Sandwich ($7) with Sweet Kanas City BBQ sauce  - Slices of homemade bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomato and onion  - Pulled Pork is nice and tender... not dry or chewy at all  - The tomato based BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy at the same time  - The fatty bacon does give the whole sandwich extra flavour   There are a lot of different choices of how you can dressed up your BBQ meat sandwiches at Smoking Hick's.. Greek, New Orleans, Mexican, Philly style..   The server/cashier was really cheerful, helped me with the selections and gave advice of the different BBQ sauces they offer... All their sides are \"homemade\"... where is this HOME?"}
