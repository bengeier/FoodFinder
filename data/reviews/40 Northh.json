They have a full menu but we all chose one of the daily specials.the meals came with a soup or salad to start, the main entree choice of steak, pork, or fish.a side vegetable and a potato selection.the meal was wrapped up with an ice cream, chocolate souffle and a nice cup of coffee.  Def will go again."}
{"text":"I have seen 40 Northh in the old Bentley's  Location for some time and my Man thought it would be the perfect place for a Romantic Dinner, he was beyond right!
 
 The waiter was fantastic and brought over the Raw Steaks in Saran Wrap on a silver Platter from the Showcase to show what they look like and how they're aged. 
 
 The Bead came out in a basket nice warm blue potoato bread and sourdough.. hard to Resist.
 
 He ordered Bavarian Onion Soup Gratinee to Start and I ordered the Grilled  Jumbo Calamari from the Coast of Portugal with radicchio, capers & spanish onions they were the small kinds with the heads attached but they were still great and delicious.

  We Enjoyed dinner with a nice glass of Malbec from Argentina.

 For the Entree My Man ordered the  Delmonaco Steak with a  baked potato.
There's no better tastier cut of Steak than the Delmonaco! 

 I ordered the  Cedar Planked Atlantic Salmon , Grilled Asparagus and it was lovely. 
Make sure you Don't come on Sunday's They're Closed!

 A true 5 star restaurant and experience
 They Did Everything First Class and was a Memorable Meal, Merci 40 Northh!"}
{"text":"Good food but a little pricey. Very good filet mignon. It is worth for your money though"}
{"text":"Excellent from the bread to the oysters not to forget their fish & meat. I truly recommend this place. The staff is very well groomed & they know their wines."}
{"text":"My food was perfect. Ana's was a little under done with not palatable bernaise sauce. Wait staff was knowledgable on wine!"}
{"text":"Located in the middle of \"downtown\" Saint Sauvere, 40 Northh is the one restaurant in town that aims to stand out by being trendy. In a town where classic restaurants seems to rule, 40Northh seemingly aims to bring a Manhattan/lounge vibe to an otherwise aging town. Everything is new, clean, and it has all the hallmarks of a place that caters to yuppies.

With all the modern amenities and fun vibes, I must say that I found the food to be just ok. The bread basket was excellent, but unfortunately this was the best part of the overall meals I started out with an order of short rib dumplings. They were pretty good but nothing amazing.

I then had a bowl of asparagus soup, which was ok. Part of the issue was the soup was like warm, but in general I just felt it could have been a bit more interesting. For the main course, I had the salmon. It was cooked nicely overall, but was pretty bland. Very disappointing considering it was a hearty dish.

Overall all, the experience here just left more to be desired from a food standpoint. From a drinks and vibe standpoint, this is probably a good option. However, I didn't really eat anything that stood out or would lure me back."}
{"text":"Excellent experience 40 Northh in St. Sauveur!

I ordered 2 hot appetizers: Filet Mignon Sausages with a mustard sampler and the Asian Beef Spring Rolls with a mango sauce. Both were great. Hubby had the crab cakes and he was very happy.

For the main dish I had the \"O & Terre\" which is a Filet Mignon and 1/4 pound giant tiger shrimp. It was very very good, but I would probably skip the shrimps next time and order just the Filet Mignon. 

For dessert, we had the Chocolate Souffle for 2 accompanied with vanilla icecream.

BEWARE: Pricing is expensive. This is like Gibby's. You are getting quality food, but you're paying the price. Be prepared to dish out your wallet. 

For Hubby & I, this resto is  reserved for VERY special occasions only, but we will definitely  return! :-) Service was professional and quick. Ambiance is nice too."}
