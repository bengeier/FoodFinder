{"text":"This is a vegetarian Sri Lankan take-out restaurant. The food is not the best quality here, but on lucky days it is. So to say, it is not consistent. Today my meal is making me very sick to the stomach. Overall, would not recommend going here."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. As a meat eater I was surprised as to how much I enjoyed their food. I go there at least once or twice a week. A rice package with 6 different curries for about $7 can last my family and I about two days. The curries are fresh and tasty. I like the brown rice and you get a pretty good portion of it. I love going back, its unlike most other veggie Sri Lankan food I have tried. I would definitely suggest you give it a try, even if just once."}
{"text":"Start your review...I had a hankering for quick, satisfying, risk free food. So I asked my friend what was what, and they replied \"Datta Pizza Daaa\". I had no idea what the name meant, but I dove in on good authority.  Datta Pizza is a small pizza shop along Middlefield Road in Scarborough. This is purely a takeout spot, so you'll be in and out. Word to the wise though, call ahead, because apparently these pies take a fair amount of time to bake. The draw to this restaurant is that it's a purely vegetarian pizzeria. No meat in sight, which I imagine is great for true vegetarians.  When it came to the pizza, I ordered a red pie with mushrooms, black olives, sundried tomatoes, garlic, and mango. Sow how was it? Unfortunately it was overhyped. (Probably because it was a suggestion from vegetarians who were starved for pizza options.) The crust and overall pie dough were not particularly note worthy, and the marinara was OK for fast food. The best part of the pizza was certainly the toppings, especially the sundried tomatoes' sharp sweetness, and the uniqueness of the mango.  The best part of the entire meal was definitely their spicy poutine. One of my pet peeves is going to an American restaurant, ordering something labelled \"spicy\", and having my mouth feel slightly warm at best. God bless ethnic restaurants for not playing with my emotions and giving me genuine spice. If I'm not uncomfortable from the heat, it's not spicy. Their non-traditional poutine is served with thick cut fries, gravy, cheese, and things like red onions, jalape√±o peppers, and red pepper to make the dish unique.  All in all, I think Datta Pizza is a cool choice for vegetarians looking to try something new. I personally won't be heading back because the pizza isn't calling me, and poutine alone isn't enough."}
{"text":"Its a little store at Middlefield and Finch. Got the pan pizza 4 topping for 9.99$ Definitely worth the price. It comes with two dip and two pops as well. All vege toppings. Pan pizza has that crispiness I like. Toppings are fresh and plenty. The person that served me was pretty nice. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, this is my go to spot! They have really good Sri Lankan food! You can get a big box of rice, with 6 curries of your choice, rasam, a dessert, and side appetizers all for just under $8!!!! It will fill 2-3 people! They have more than 15 curries to choose from DAILY; however, the wait time is the worst on certain days like Fridays as well as the weekends. Delicious food, friendly staff, and they even have a pizza place nearby! They have really good appetizers and other dinner items as well such as kothurothi, and pittu."}
{"text":"Ordered the large deep dish 4 topping special, came with a drink and two dips.   Toppings - Paneer, tomatoes, onions, green peppers.  Dips - Garlic and a south-west type.   Was fairly satisfied with the pizza. You can taste the quality of the cheese and the toppings. The paneer was surprisingly well flavored pretty much the highlight of the pizza. The crust is not the Chicago deep dish variant, not sure if you can consider it deep dish, it was meh gets the job done. The dipping sauce for a non-franchise store was really good. Usually similar locations give you salad dressing but in this case, they were rich and compliments the pizza well.   Overall would recommend the pizza, especially for vegetarians. Worth the price. Would give it a 4/5 but had some minor annoyances. The debit machine did not work even after 3 attempts, best to have cash on hand. When I went there were no menus showing whats available to order or the topping list. Next day realized they have a site in which they have 22 toppings to select from. I was told about 7 by the staff -_-, then again whos going to remember all 22.   3.5 / 5   Check toppings here :  https://www.dattapizzadaaa.com/?product=pan-pizza"}
