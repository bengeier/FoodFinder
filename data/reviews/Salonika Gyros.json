{"text":"I love this place. I eat here anytime I go downtown for anything. Always get the Gyro with extra meat and sauce. So amazing. YUM!"}
{"text":"Went here before the regatta yesterday, was my third time here...consistently great, best gyros around!! Thanks."}
{"text":"my falafel was ok, but my brother kabob was really good. great location. reasonable price"}
{"text":"A little disappointed in the flavor of the green beans in tomato sauce a bit salty. The ground beef of moussaka was tasty,but potatoes and bechamel sauce too dry.  Just went to the Holy Trinity Greek festival and was very pleased with the flavors of the same items. Freshly prepared that day."}
{"text":"Fairly decent gyro for the price. The other reviewers are spot on with the pita being too small...I appreciate the amount of meat and filling, but it was impossible to eat by hand. Tzatiki sauce was tasty and the added onions and peppers were a nice touch. Nothing mind blowing but it hit the spot when I stopped for a quick snack.

Did not investigate the bathroom here."}
{"text":"Definitely better than I expected. The restaurant seemed a little shady on the outside, but the food was cheap and delicious. I got a moussaka and it was rich and full of flavor, and the sides did not disappoint either.

Check this place out if you are looking for something quick that doesn't hurt your wallet and doesn't skimp on flavor."}
{"text":"Gyros are delicious,  all the  toppings nice and crisp .  Homemade pierogies scrumptious.  Waitress always friendly"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, and was very pleasantly surprised! Not fancy, but very good food (all looks homemade) and reasonably priced. Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I go here almost weekly. You can get a huge grilled chicken salad with bread and tzatiki for $6.25. Absolutely worth it for the money."}
{"text":"I like Salonika's.  I've been here a few times over the last couple months, and the food is consistently good.

Some of the winning dishes are the baked chicken, chicken gyros, and definitely the lemon potatoes.  The salmon in pastry shell is also very good.

The staff is rushed but efficient.  Given how busy they can be, they get you in and out.

Even when other lunch places are empty, you'll still find a restaurant full at Salonika's.  Part of it is the prices, which are reasonable. Part of it is that the food is mostly ready to serve, so it's fast.

But overall, the quality of the food is what keeps bringing me back, anyways."}
{"text":"I love this place. Gyros, spinach pie, fries and hummus. Way better than any other gyro place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"For a quick lunch this place is as good as it gets. The prices are very low and the food is delicious. My go to is their Gyro Salad but I recently gave some of their other food a chance and it was phenomenal. If you are looking for some fancy decor or high brow establishment this isn't your place but if you want a delicous quick lunch this your place."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Salonikas on 6th St. over a dozen times over the past three years.  I would eat here more often if it was more convenient.  To me, the gyro here is the best in Pittsburgh.  Better than ANY other.  Until someone can point me at a Gyro place that makes them like they do in some of the larger cities in the U.S., or like in Greece or Turkey, where they hand make the meat on a spit, it is lamb sliced thin, and placed in layers on a skewer, then slow roasted, and sliced and served while you watch, then Salonikas will remain the best.  

Seriously, every single Gyro place around here just buys that big round slab of processed meat, and puts it on a spinner. Folks that say \"Oh it is seasoned so perfectly at XXXX\" are nuts.  No place around here makes their own lamb gyro meat. If you know of one, put it down, I want to go there.

I like Salonikas because I like the pita, it is nice and thick and chewy, and they fry it on the flat top.  Places that don't heat the pita (like that place on the Strip that sells Gyros for $5 and he don't even heat the pita?!?!) They STINK!  

I like the tszaziki (however you spell it).  It is nice and thick and well seasoned.  It does not go running down your arm when you take a big honking bite of your gyro.  

I like the meat, it is seasoned so perfectly!  (!?!?!) Actually, they cook it long enough to make it a bit crusty, and they slice it nice and thin.  And they put on a LOT of it.  

And all the veg is just right.  I wish they used hotter onions, but oh well.

And best of all, they have a bar, that is VERY fairly priced.  Especially considering it is located so near the theatre district.  I also absolutely like all the other stuff they have, the spanakopata, and the moussaka, and the grape leaves.  Pretty much anything they sell.

And keep this in mind, this place is inexpensive.  I mean seriously, the negative reviews this place gets all seem to say \"the prices are cheap, and tastes it\".  Well, bull.  The food is inexpensive, and what you get for what they charge, is way above what you expect.  Like, instead of ground lamb in some dishes, you get ground beef.  Still tastes good to me.  Not as great as it would be with ground lamb, but it keeps the price down, and it still tastes good.

My favorite time to eat here?  New Years eve, or Pittsburgh Light Up Night.  I have been here every one of those the past three years, they are packed, you get to have a gyro and a beer.  It is just a nice fun time.  And considering how busy they are, the staff are all way happier that at some of those pinky-in-the-air joiunts in the theatre district.

Oh, and the customers are all friendly.  Nice mix of blue collar and cops and folks getting a bite before or after some event in the cultural district.  I REALLLY like this place.  

Now, next reviewer who throws down some ignorant review about how some other gyro is better, first, is it a REAL gyro, made with REAL thin sliced lamb, slow cooked on a spit and sliced off fresh and juicy, then PLEASE put the name of the place in your review.  I have tried EVERY gyro spot in the city, and quite a few outside it.  And I am STILL looking for a REAL gyro made like that.  Until then, this place is the best for me."}
{"text":"pretty good gyro cooked on rotisserie as it should be they told me it is 75/25 % lamb/beef. they have a combo special with fried they let me substitute lemon potatoes, which were quite good.. reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Salonikas by a friend, and we made quite a few trips into the city just for their gyros every month. Now I work just down the street, so I get to go even more! Best gyro and cucumber sauce I've ever had! Love the price too!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch to try something different. The first thing I noticed is that I felt like a took a time machine back to the 80's when I entered. Some simple renovations would make this place look a million times better. It just didn't feel clean to me for some reason, and it was rather dark.  The staff was overall fairly friendly, but I've definitely experienced better customer service. I got a chicken gyro, which was average. The pita was good, and all the ingredients were good as well. The chicken was average. My problem was with the amount of sauce and onions they put on it. It was overloaded with the sauce, so much so that it virtually drowned the pita. I also feel like there was about a half an onion on the gyro. Overall, it was ok, but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"A little divey but it's a good place for a quick gyro downtown. Salonikas has a pretty decent menu of Greek dishes along with a different daily special for every day of the week. And they also have a bar in the back. When I lived downtown, this was my and my husband's go-to for a quick and affordable meal that was not fast food. Salonikas might be cheaper than McDonalds if you really take into consideration all that you're getting. My husband always ordered a gyro dinner and I sometimes got the falafel, veggie plate, or one of the daily specials. Nothing fancy. But that's my thing, good doesn't have to be fancy. For Salonikas to get a decent crowd for dinner despite several other Greek/Mediterranean restaurants on the same street, they have to be doing something right."}
{"text":"We just came back from Greece & I've been dying for an authentic gyro. We were downtown for the Billy Joel concert, I saw Salonika & had to have it.

I had the gyro special which is a gyro, potatoes & drink. Luckily, they let me swap out their spectacular lemon potatoes that melted in my mouth for the French fries. I had the beef/lamb original gyro. The meat was so tender and tasty. Yum!

My friend really enjoyed the Athena chicken.

They have extremely reasonable prices. There is not much of an atmosphere, but for cheap prices & great food you can deal with it. There is also a bar in the back, which is a bonus. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is underrated for sure. It's definitely not the prettiest of places, especially compared to all the fancy restaurants downtown, but it's delicious food at a great price. You get huge portions here too. You order at the counter and take it to your seat. There are plenty of tables so you never have to worry about a large party. The gyro is enormous and comes with lots of toppings, and the chicken is tender!"}
{"text":"While staying at the Renaissance in downtown Pittsburgh we swung in here for a late night bite to eat. On out visit we had the Gyro combo and a greek salad. Both were extremely affordable and delicious. The staff at Salonika was great as well. Very friendly, and approachable. If ever in downtown Pittsburgh for a show, and looking for a great, and cheap bite to eat look no further than Salonika Gyros! And... they are open late!"}
{"text":"Love this place always come for the gyro made the traditional way.  Small cafe very clean.  If you wanted to watch a game they have a 55 inch flat screen.  Always busy the Line literally out the door.  Not pricey in the 3-12 range"}
{"text":"Salonika's is like a best friend. All ways there when I need it. There have been many a long and stressful work day that has been turned around by the great service and attentiveness of the staff. The night staff is always quick with a smile and conversation, which goes a long way for me,  since I'm usually alone which can be awkward. 

 The lunch service can be a bit hit or miss probably because it gets really really busy during lunch , but their late night service is much better.  

I go to Salonika's no less then 3 nights a week.  The bartenders are super friendly I even consider Brain the night bartender a friend. 

There are other upscale places to eat and drink in the vicinity but if cheap eats and drinks  and friendless is what you're looking for you can't go wrong with Salonikas.

Also please be aware they are now serving Mimosas!  Which are super yummy and served in a martini glass with a twist of orange!"}
{"text":"The food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do in a pinch.  The service is quick and the prices are reasonable for Downtown.  They are open late hours, so sometimes that can be handy.  There are better places for Greek food, but Salonika's is often close by."}
{"text":"I wanted Greek food for lunch, so tried to stop in to Christo's across the street.  Strangely, there was no one in there at 11:30 on a Thursday - no one eating, no one apparently working, so we crossed the street to Salonika's and I am happy that we did. 

When you walk in, there is food under glass and you walk up to the counter to order.  There is a menu on the board - gyros, salads, moussaka, etc.  I decided to follow my friend's lead and get the Zeus chicken - chicken, spinach and feta in phyllo with green beans in tomato sauce.  After paying, we got a number and took our plastic silverware to sit down.  It's definitely old school in here with benches looking like they came out of the 50's, but they were comfortable and clean, so I'm not complaining.  

The food came out extremely quickly on cafeteria-style trays.  A large phyllo burrito filled to the brim with spinach, feta and chicken with a nice pile of canned green beans in a flavorful tomato sauce.  There was also a tray of pita bread.  All in all, it was pretty delicious.  My friend also got a piece of cheesecake which looked pretty tasty.  

For 10 bucks for the meal and drink, it was a decent amount of food and very filling.  I would definitely go back to try other specialties."}
{"text":"I stopped by last night for dinner with CM after we'd spent the afternoon at Duquesne University, since I had a City Dining Card for Salonika, and it'd been awhile since CM and I had had Greek food. The first thing to note that surprised me a bit is that Salonika doesn't provide table service--orders and payment are accepted up front, and food is provided on trays that you take to a table in the dining area.  The staff bus the tables, which clearly needed doing at the time of my visit.

Based on other Yelpers' recommendations, I ordered the rosemary half chicken with lemon potatoes ($7.39), and CM did the same.  While the flavor of this entree was decent, I found it extremely greasy, and I suspect the chicken wasn't of the best quality, since pieces of bone kept breaking off and ending up in my mouth.  As for the lemon potatoes, again, the flavor was on point, but the texture was off, such that they were mushy in some places and so hard as to prevent chewing in others. The sauce on the plate from the potatoes had a great flavor, which I used to dip the chicken and complimentary pita bread that came with the entrees into, but it was also quite greasy from the chicken.

CM and I also decided to order dessert, with him ordering the baklava and me ordering the chocolate cake, which looked super-tempting in the case.  I'm happy to report that the cake didn't disappoint--it was substantial and moist with thick, fudgy icing and a pleasant, though unexpected, tinge of anise flavor.  I tried a piece of CM's baklava, and enjoyed it as well--it had a generous coating of honey, and plenty of chopped nuts.

Overall, I found the food at Salonika to be inexpensive (at least, for entrees and the Cultural District) and flavorful, but to be lacking somewhat in execution.  I'd consider returning the next time I'm downtown and have a craving for Greek food, since I believe Salonika is one of the few gyro places downtown that stays open beyond lunch hours.  If I'm looking for a nicer sit-down dinner, however, I'll pass Salonika up for one of the many other restaurants in the vicinity. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Salonika is a popular place judging by the crowds they get in here.  The ambiance here isn't the greatest so it's definitely a place to get takeout chow.  
The basic menu here won't surprise you any.  It's your basic gyros, sandwiches, salads, hoagies, paninis, etc.  I went for the chicken gyro and it was pretty tasty. They've got a few specialties here including 
youvetsi and mousaka.  They've got your basic sides too, but if I ever get back here I'm gonna try the lemon potatoes.  

So it pretty much looks like an old reliable type of place and I'll bet most of the people I saw were regulars."}
{"text":"I have been here several times in the last year. The food is average...kind of fast-food-like. It sits in the warmer cases, and looks \"crusty\". The gyros are average, not as good as the ones at the South Side gyro restaurant, by any means.  The salads are from a bag of pre-chopped lettuce, and not \"fresh\" or interesting. 

But in order to enjoy the average food, you have to get past the really rude food wait staff.  The bartenders seem to be OK, the clientele in the bar seem to be regulars, and it is a \"cheap drink\" attraction to some downtown locals. 

The staff that serves the food, and takes the orders are out of this world rude. There is one that wins the prize for insulting the customers, and after having endured her, I will never, ever return. Owners should know how they are being represented at the front register. The man that cooks and plates the food is oblivious, or just is used to hearing her speak to people with such a lack of respect, that he is just deaf to it. 

Go somewhere else. It is cheap food, and you get what you pay for. I would pay twice as much, to feel like the staff gave a crap that I was there supporting their jobs."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Nice place. I have a few items I'd like to try so I'll certainly go back. Had a fried tilapia sandwich and loved it. I usually stay away because its never seasoned right. This place got it right. Best fried tilapia I've had. Nice selection, friendly service and affordable."}
{"text":"It may not look like much, but don't judge a book by its cover. If you are looking to grab a quick lunch and you like gyros, look no further! 

What I like about this place is everything is basically already made. You are in and out in no time. I have had their stuffed grape leaves and gyros both equally delicious and did I happen to say filling. They really stuff the grape leaves and load up the gyro with meat and other toppings. The tzatziki sauce was different compared to other tzatziki sauces I have tried. It's on the thicker side, which I really liked because it wasn't running everywhere. The prices are reasonable and the food is good!"}
{"text":"I use to work on the North Shore and walked  over here for lunch regularly.  I like the gyro salad, hummus and stuffed peppers.  The food is made fresh every day by the owner.  Nothing is frozen.  My wife and I always eat here on Light Up Night and before shows in the theater district.  It's always busy, and the staff has always been generous and friendly.  One of my favorite small-eats places in the city."}
{"text":"I was running out of time today at lunch and needed somewhere to grab lunch. On a positive note, i seen the Google street view car downtown :)

Anyways, my gyro just wasnt that good. It seemed smaller than any other gyro in town, the fries were just frozen potatoes with no flavor and it just wasn't a very awesome experience.

Also, almost $9 for a small gyro, frozen fries & a small drink is not a \"deal\". M&Ts is $7.50- same fries of course  but a large, delicious gyro.  I dunno, I've heard great things about this place but i'll stick with my regular oll Zorba's for downtown or M&Ts afterhours."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this casual Greek restaurant for its cheap but tasty food. She was right! The staff was nice, there was adequate seating, the food was cooked and brought out fast, and the food tasted good, especially for the very reasonable prices. The restaurant definitely is not fancy, but if you are looking for a quick and cheap meal, give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"It was very cold inside the restaurant. I had the posieden salmon and the filo dough was so tough I couldn't cut it my plastic fork. My husbands pork was a small portion. It was very inexpensive and I understand why. Won't go back or recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm in PIT for a couple of days and decided to explore food options in downtown. Little did I know what was coming.

Let's start with pros. This place is clean, but you would expect that from a \"restaurant\" anyway. And...that's it. I've run out of good things.

The food is godawful. It's so terrible in fact that I'd be better if I had gotten a frozen hamburger from a local grocery store and then cooked it on the car's engine.
 
I'm sorry but next time I'd rather eat my shoes than go here. And if you do care about what you eat - you'd too. I've been to some pretty crappy dining places around the world and with all my confidence I can say that it was not food. It was just some terrible substance that, for all I know, could have been someone's dirty socks. Tasted exactly the same."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Cheap gyro combo = cheap tasting meal. When stepping into the restaurant the first thing I noticed were glass cases storing food. It had the feel of a cafeteria or at best a deli at a gas station convenient store. Not feeling adventurous I got the gyro meal, which is a good deal. The fries were cooked to perfection, but lacked flavor. I had to dump salt on them, which is never a good thing unless you as for unsalted fries. The gyro itself was mediocre. The ingredients inside were fresh and made to order, but I did have to use a knife and fork to eat it as the pita was just a bit too small of the large mass of the contents. The slice of chocolate cake, while a descent size, was rather tasteless. The icing was pretty good, but the cake itself had almost no flavor, perhaps freezer burn. It did seem as if the cake had been frozen. I also felt like the harried girl taking orders behind the counter was overworked. She apparently had no time to take a wet cloth the the tables. I kind of felt bad for her. 

Overall, I'd go here if I worked a block away and only had a half hour lunch break. Quick and cheap as a fast food joint, but not delicious enough as a dinner."}
{"text":"This is a local dive bar and be prepared to find some interesting characters. That being said I ordered a gyro with the lemon fries. My sandwich was excellent! The pita was fresh, the meat was juicy and flavorful, the sauce and toppings were a perfect balance. The lemon fries were good but I would prefer them to have been more crispy and less grease. I ordered shock top which was on tap. I was so pleased because it is a seasonal beer. The place is clean but I would never take my kids. The bartender will talk your  ear off but was a nice person with a little crazy added on. I felt like being in a \"just got out of jail\" commercial with everyone coming in to buy a 40 from the beer cooler. If I am ever back in town and plan on going to a game I will grab a sandwich from here for sure!"}
{"text":"Before you buy into someone's reviews too much it would be helpful to look at their rating distribution (like the only 5 star rating person below me). But anyway, this place is average at best. The gyro I had tasted mostly like every other gyro have had except that the lettuce and cucumber sauce was not evenly mixed in it so I would bite into huge globs. The base Gyro price was $4.95, but the guy behind the counter sold me on the 'lunch special' that came with fries and a drink (came out to $8.50). Well, that was a mistake. You barely get any fries and they aren't that good anyway. Ketchup is served in those old-school refillable plastic containers. The interior looks like it hasn't been updated since 1968 and so it has kind of a grimy look to it. This place doesn't accept credit cards. Come on...let's call up Marty so we can get back to the future here.

I don't plan on coming back.

Food Quality/Taste = 2 Stars
Portion Size Given Price = 2 Stars

{"text":"I am surprised by the low ratings. I have eaten here on the go several times and really enjoyed the gyros. My vegan friend got the falafel and was impressed as well. Granted, we were starving, but I think it was above average. Ambiance is certainly not their forte--but that didn't matter to us. We grabbed our piping hot sandwiches and hoofed it outside just in time to catch Skyblast over PNC Park. A clear night, fresh gyros and fireworks reflecting off the buildings and river--pretty nice."}
{"text":"Gyros are one of my favorite foods and I love trying them from all around the city. Salonikas is hands down the best gyro place in all of Pittsburgh. Their wings and fries are also fantastic. I really wish it was closer so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"This place is the ultimate two star. If you have a craving for a cheap gyro downtown at night in Pittsburgh, this is the place to go. Unfortunately, Mike & Tony's closes by 6pm. You won't get good service, you will get frozen french fries tossed in the deep fryer served in disappointingly small portions. You will have to scrounge around for a bottle of ketchup and hot sauce. However, the gyro meat is freshly cut off the spit, and the over-stuffed sandwich is a good deal at $4.30. 

Overall, there aren't that many cheap places open at night downtown, so go here if you're stranded and can't stand the thought of another Sammy's corned beef sandwich. Otherwise, hold out for one of downtown's great lunch spots."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a very late night dinner after our flight into Pittsburgh from Charlotte. We were staying just up the street at the Pittsburgh Renaissance Hotel. It was after 10:00 pm and you could not get a bite to eat in the hotel.

So we walked down the street - most places were already closed, and a couple of places that were open that had bars - were no longer serving food.

Fortunately we found Salonika Gyros! We both ordered a traditional Gyro, and they were prepared fresh and hot on the spot.

We knew we must have a good place - as 3 of Pittsburgh's finest from their police department were taking a dinner break and eating in here as well.

The Gyro was damn tasty! The meat was succulent and perfectly cooked with a slight char to it, and the yogurt sauce was just the right compliment to the Gyro!

Salonika is not much to look at - it's your local working man's food joint in a traditional northern blue collar city! Which means it's great ambiance! Appreciate it for what it is!

I'd definitely come back here for more Gyros and to try other stuff!"}
{"text":"I can;t believe the ratings aren't higher for this place! The Greek salad and hummus were OUT OF THIS WORLD. All my friends that ate here-- all had different things (lemon chicken, gyros, etc.)-- all said the same the same thing. The chef is so nice and would always hook me up with some extra pita. I wish I lived closer to this place, I would be there all the time!"}
{"text":"What a great location. Staff are super friendly and efficient. Got the gyro salad and it was great. Large portion size and yummy with the Greek dressing."}
{"text":"I'm being generous since I didn't actually eat here. My dad and I walked in around 7 pm on a Friday night. The place was pretty busy. The dining room was about half full. The other half of the tables were covered in dirty dishes. A large party of people were gathered in the middle standing around and shouting loudly. People just seemed to be standing around this whole place for no reason. We told the lady at the counter we hadn't been here before and asked her what to do. She said order your food. She said it pretty rudely, and we still weren't exactly sure what to do. We decided we didn't want to eat at a place with lousy service, filthy tables, and unruly patrons and walked out."}
{"text":"The chicken with an added dash of hot sauce is fall off the bone delicious! The potatoes are so well cooked and delicious, and the pita bread has a hint of sweetness to it, and of course is so soft, warm and delicious! I also had the green beans, they were perfect but could've used an extra ingredient, maybe some garlic salt. Wow, now this is some Greek food I can get behind!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: the food was pretty good and service was quick. Friendly staff

Cons: check your food. My gyro salad came with no dressing. Outta bread was a bit burnt and the Buffalo wings came with one small (actually tiny) half filled cup of dipping sauce.  

Overall pretty good for the price. Just check your order."}
{"text":"Pros: Super fast, very affordable (I'm from out of town, so maybe it's not as affordable by Pittsburgh standards). Good-sized portions. Grape leaves were excellent. I had the meatless version. Rice pudding was quite good too.

Cons: It's pretty low-frills. Some of the food is a bit greasy."}
{"text":"I love getting lunch here.  It's affordable and the portions are nice. My go to is the veggie platter that consists of: triangle piece of spanakopita, 3 grape leaves, hummus and pita all for around $5.30.  They have other Greek options to choose from. The assortment of desserts offered a really inexpensive too."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for gyros and decided to try a place we had never been to. The restaurant has been there for years but we normally go to Mike & Tony's for gyros. We both ordered the Gyro Special for $8.88. You get a gyro, fries, and a drink. 
The portions were smaller than we normally get at other gyro places. The fries could have been cooked a minute or two longer. We had to add salt. The pita on the gyro was small and soft. I was worried it was going to tear or break but it didn't. The gyro meat was okay but not as flavorful as other places I've eaten. The sauce didn't hold much flavor either and was a little watery. 
Though I wasn't impressed, nor would I go back for the gyros, I would go back to try some of the other items on their menu. They had a baked Greek chicken with lemon potatoes that seemed to be selling more than the gyros were. I think I need to take a group there and have everyone order something different so we could try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Salonika's is good in a pinch. I always find myself here when I have tickets to an 8pm show at the theater and I'm just rolling into the 6th Ave parking garage at 7:20, hungry, and without a reservation to any of the more popular downtown dinner spots (Sometimes I'm bad at planning). 

It goes a little something like this: Order at the register, pay at the register, take a seat, wait 5 minutes for food to be delivered, inhale gyro and BAM! I can make it to the theater with enough time to find my seat and browse the playbill. The gyros are pretty good. I prefer mine with about half the provided onions and with the gyro sauce on the side so I can really slather it on. The staff here is always friendly and the prices are reasonable. This is an A-OK place all around. 

Bonus: they are open fairly late. So if you haven't left yourself any time to eat before a show in the cultural district, you can stop in after the show is over (Yup, I've done this too when I'm EXTRA terrible at planning)."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place got a bad rating!!! Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!!
Why would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. 
I live about a block away from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!!
Sure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. 
The food is absolutely amazing!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling. 
I always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. 
The pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. 
I bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. 
There is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \"unsavories\" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all.
Keep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way. 
You will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!!"}
{"text":"I've got mixed feelings about this place. I've gotten gyros for take out here on a number of occasions and have always enjoyed them.  I've also enjoyed beers and shots at the bar and have been impressed by the reasonable price. But today I thought I'd try something different for lunch and went with the Greek Meatballs over rice.

Let's first address the dinning room.  This place is screaming for an upgrade. The ceiling tiles are stained and don't match, the chairs don't match and the booths a probably the original ones installed when this place opened (I know they've been here for at least 20 years). 

The service is fast, the wait staff is friendly but the Greek meatballs I had today were unimpressive. They were dry with a charred coating. The tomato sauce that covered them however was delicious and the rice that came with the dish was puffed and fluffy. I would have been happy with just the sauce over the rice. 

I don't dislike Salonikas and I'm not trying to dissuade you from coming here.  I'm sure I'll be back again for gyros and beers. But what I am saying is that there's room for improvement thus earning the three star review."}
{"text":"Terrific food! We were rushing a bit from a busy morning and early afternoon. My boy and I were going to the symphony, but he was hungry (starving, Dad!), with about an hour and a few minutes before the curtain. He likes Greek, so we stopped in and really had a great meal! Quickly prepared, great service, and really good food! The boy had a gyro and some chicken (yeah...he was hungry, like a 10 year old boy can be); I had the pastitsio and some rice. Delicious! Very reasonably priced. This will now be a fairly regular stop when we're heading to the PSO - so says the Little Man!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm not enough of a \"critical eater\" since I don't think it should be anyone's mission on Yelp to tell everyone how mediocre or bad everything is. Anyone who is truly in such a perpetual funk shouldn't even bother crawling out of their subterranean lair, let alone take the time to write about why everything supposedly sucks sod. I'll just go ahead and discount their compulsively gloomy reviews as much as they'll disregard mine, thank you very much. 

Having gotten that out of my system, I can say with sound mind that I rather enjoyed my gyro, french fries, and chocolate cake at Salonika's after having taken in a show at Heinz Hall. 

It wasn't my first choice (Meat & Potatoes was full), and we only went into Salonika's since it was only other casual restaurant open at that hour in the immediate vicinity, but I have no regrets. 

My only complaint about my El Cheapo dinner was that the gyro wasn't the best constructed sandwich one could eat. As with many a gyro, it fell apart halfway through like David Lee Roth did during Van Halen shows back in the glory days. The tzatziki sauce was also placed messily atop everything. 

Hint: My favored gyro joint, Brookline's It's Greek To Me, not only uses a bigger pita wrap, they also tidily place the tzatziki sauce BELOW the meat and vegetables, making your munch session stress-free. 

Despite having to tackle this thing with knife and fork, I found that the straight-from-the-spit meat was nicely fragile and correctly seasoned. The pita bread, like that found at It's Greek To Me, was delightfully toasted, not to mention plusher than a comforter.

Hey, I order french fries at Greek restaurants as they go famously with gyros, and these were pipingly crispy and golden. 

Salonika's great, they gave us chocolate cake...

If you're unfamilar with the above stand-up comedy concert the above link is from, you have a DVD to rent. The cake almost had me doing Bill Cosby's goofy dance. Not that this was on par with anything from Bethel or Oakmont, but it was simple, joyful bake-sale fare with a goodly rich (or richly good?) fudge icing. 

Yes, Salonika's also offers Moussaka, Chicken Athena, Spanakopita, and Pastitsio among other Greek delicacies (all displayed under glass to tempt you) along with the usual burgers, wings, and hoagies. The service is fine albeit somewhat hurried (we didn't feel like we had time to peruse the menu board). You order at the counter and wait until your number or meal is called. After ordering, the young woman who waited on us asked us how we were and what show we saw while she scanned the restaurant, pre-occupied with the motley assemblage of friendly, boisterous reg'lars. I'm betting they were mostly taxi drivers, although we did see some fellow in business casual attire with his face in a laptop computer, so I guess that means they have Wi-Fi? 

P.S. The soda fountain is self-serve, which is always a perk. 

P.P.S. They've been around since 1986! I didn't even know they existed until I joined Yelp. 

P.P.P.S. They'll bus your table for you once you're finished. Due to the eatery's self-serve nature, I assumed otherwise, much to the amusement of employees and loyal customers alike who jokingly asked if I needed a job. I don't know that I'd want to work there, but I would return to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"I like their gyro salad. It tastes very good with the pita bread. Good portion. I don't get hungry later afternoon."}
{"text":"Zeus Chicken was excellent! Nice Greek restaurant, clean and great service. They even give a discount for Highmark employees. This is a great place if you enjoy or want to try Greek fare."}
