{"text":"Bellagio Pool Café is AMAZING! I went to the pool last month thinking this place was a snack stand and it's a full service restaurant with excellent food! I had the grilled fish tacos with a frozen \"funky monkey\" banana cocktail, and my sister had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Everything was delicious and our server (John?) was a total sweetheart. I'll definitely be back next pool season!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY the worst experience ever.  We went into the restaurant and asked for a table for two. The lady said \"OKAY, one moment\".  She then turned to her friend that came after us.  She turned to them started talking and catching up with them and totally ignored us.  I mean OBVIOUSLY ignored us.  I assume she doesn't care for gay people or perhaps we were not the right race. HOWEVER, we left, dusted our shoes off and will not return."}
{"text":"Comme tous le reste du Bellagio le Pool bar est un endroit agréable pour déjeuner à l'abri de la foule et de la chaleur du strip. Le personnel est, comme dans le reste du complexe aux petits soins, les plats sont suffisamment variés pour trouver son bonheur et ensuite, après un petit somme au soleil aller faire un petit plongeon dans l'une des 12 piscines du Bellagio :-) bref c'est comme dans Ocean11 mais en mieux :-) enjoy! Dernière chose : comme tout le Bellagio, niveau tarifs ce n'est pas ce qu'il y a de plus accessible à Las Vegas..."}
{"text":"If you are staying at Bellagio, forget about the Cafe Bellagio next to the conservatory and try this beautiful Pool cafe!!!  It is located in the controlled access pool area so I believe only room guests can go in.  That is provably why they weren't so busy even though we were there for busy Memorial Day weekend.  After we secure our loungers in the pool, we come here to have a breakfast and we weren't expected the breakfast experience to be this wonderful!!    I ordered All American breakfast (2 eggs, sausage, breakfast potatoes, tomato, and English muffin) all for $16.  My husband ordered ham and cheese omelet $15. The server asked if he want to add something on the top of ham and cheese, he added few items which later we found out each cost $2.  It does not stated in the menu so watch that if you are cost conscious person like me.  The breakfast potatoes were so much better than hash brown offered at the cafe Bellagio.  Our server was very nice but hostesses (couple of lady at the cafe front desk) were typical Bellagio's energy saving mode machine like service.    Since we stayed two nights, we decided to give a try for the cafe Bellagio next morning but we were so regret that we did not come back to this pool cafe.  Cafe Bellagio was just bunch of tourists crammed in a very standard restaurant decor, you are expected get fed and go. Pretty much same price but the Pool Cafe has spacious open air seating areas and much better quality!!"}
{"text":"What a lovely place, located right on the pools at the Bellagio.    After a morning of swimming with the little, we all were ready for some lunch.  The staff were so great with our daughter, literally treating her like (and calling her) a princess.  She felt so fancy.    It's a delightful outdoor cafe with pergolas overhead with the best view.    The food was lovely, as well!  I'd been dying for a margarita pizza and they had one!! And it did not disappoint!  My husband had the fish tacos, which he said he enjoyed.  Our daughter tried their popcorn chicken, which she'd never had before.  It's always a little scary when a kid this picky orders something she's never had.  But, she devoured it.    I want to say that our total bill was around $45, which is about average for a place like this in a resort, but we loved it all so much that we'd do it again!  Be aware though, that although it is the Pool Cafe, you do have to wear clothes to be seated; you can't just waltz in wearing your bikini."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in ALL of Las Vegas! Stinks you have to be a guest of the hotel to visit this little paradise!    For starters the staff is second to none and over the top friendly. I have had the same server twice and she really made an effort to get to know us and our vacation and even remembered us the second time we came the following year.   The menus (for breakfast and lunch) are just the right size. A lot of options but not overwhelming. For breakfast I have tried the pancakes and French toast and both are to die for, very fluffy and plated nicely. For lunch I tried the grilled cheese with pita fries AH-MAZING!   Prices are a little high but what can you expect! You are at Bellagio after all.   Would go back anyday"}
{"text":"Great food service and atmosphere. They also have the coolers that were perfect for the 108 degree day!"}
{"text":"Our water was served with fresh lemon slices and we ordered the turkey club pretty much every day. It was delicious and filled with bacon. The fries were really good as well!"}
{"text":"I was told I couldn't sit at a table I wanted because it would be difficult for the waiter to walk over there. Emely from the Philippines might be very new, but that's the dumbest thing I have ever heard."}
{"text":"Such an amazing experience. The food was frekn wonderful, try the Bellagio burger!! Manny, from the Philippines, had such great service. Very attentive, polite, and simply amazing. He was very thorough with the menu and recommended food that was perfect for our taste. It's hard to find a server like him. He is spec-f*n-tacular."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff all the way around. We appreciate that! Accommodating and fast service. My drink wasn't constantly refilled. Fantastic choice food, fresh, great quality by far! Perfect for a quick, nice, relaxing lunch! Thank u Pool Cafe!"}
{"text":"I love everything in this hotel. Food is amazing, service is great. Good place to have a rest"}
{"text":"Exemplary service & food just steps from the Bellagio pools. I can't think of a more relaxed setting for a cocktail and a bite to eat. The Fish & Chips was delicious and the white sangria was out of this world. There are many dining options at the Bellagio,  you should check this one out too."}
{"text":"Awesome food! We got the tomato stack as an appetizer and it was delicious! Fresh ingredients! I also got the raw tuna tacos and they were so good! The tuna was so fresh and they were the perfect size for lunch! My husband got the pork tacos and loved them! We would definitely eat there again! It's fast, convenient and a good price for Vegas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious choices!  And the coffee was perfect. Prices are on a par with most of the Strip."}
{"text":"Really good food! I was surprised since it's in the pool area. We got the chicken salad, chicken panini, popcorn chicken, buffalo drum lets, poke tacos and the turkey club. Everything was surprisingly light and very fresh. The popcorn chicken wasn't super fried or greasy. Just right! Highly recommend for a quick bite poolside. Truly a wonderful, affordable meal :)"}
{"text":"The Pool Cafe at the Bellagio was just ok for me.  The food was good.  The setting is pretty.  The servers could not have been more sweet and attentive--every one more delightful than the next.  The only issue was the smoking clientele.  It's odd to me that smoking is allowed at any restaurant.  Are we back in the 80's?  Isn't there laws or codes preventing ingesting Marlboro's with every bite of chicken???  I'm not an expert and don't really care enough to investigate, but seems to me that whoever is in charge at the Bellagio needs to examine this.  It's one thing when I'm in the casino, but a whole different story when I'm outside trying to enjoy lunch."}
{"text":"Pretty average. Look forward to tomorrow dinner at Lago.  Service was great!  Joe was fantastic. Food needed more seasoning or something. We still enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"By far the most beautiful pool cafe we've gone too! From the service and the appearance this outdoor cafe is perfect! We were there to celebrate my bffs birthday & we had the fresh fruit platter - trying to eat healthy.   then I saw \"The Classic Banana Split\" & just had to have it!   Let me tell you it was to die for! Vanilla, chocolate & strawberry gelato with chocolate syrup, a banana,real whipped cream, nuts & maraschino cherries - all for only $10 YUM!"}
{"text":"Tried the salmon. Great service and view. But would recommend else considering the variety of restaurants available in Vegas"}
{"text":"The \"hidden\" secret at the Bellagio. The Pool Cafe is located in the Bellagio's gorgeous pool area. The food is superb...I ate there twice. Lunch: Heirloom Tomato and Burratta salad was wonderful.   Breakfast: Breakfast Croissant Sandwich was out-of-this-world!  The Croissant was so flaky and perfect.  One of the best croissants I've ever had.   This is a hidden gem at the Bellagio.  Lots of servers, food that is a big step above a typical pool cafe, and a location that can't be beat."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Decor & Style: 5/5  Very nice poolside cafe and has very good burgers. Beer selection was not large (Most of Vegas doesn't have a large variety of beer anyway). A great place for lunch right next to the pool! Drink up! Eat up! Will be back if I stay at Bellagio again."}
{"text":"Good choice!!! Good breakfast. We ate Benedict eggs and Smoked salmon bagle. Everything was excellent."}
{"text":"This is the best pool I've been to in Vegas. Lot's of ornamentation with statues, tall groomed mature trees, and an arbor over the walkway.  This is a relaxing setting, if you're looking for the thumping disco pool, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent service, even for this poolside lounger.  Wait staff in jump suits circulate the pool area on a regular basis ensuring all is good.  Good menu options and just about any beverage you can concoct.  I waived eating and stayed with water to rehydrate because this Mr. Atlas wanna be was still recovering for a beating in the Health Spa on the elliptical & stationary bike.  The poolside is immense with an ample amount of lounge chairs, towels, and umbrellas.  Cabanas are available for a fin or two.  The pool temperature is very comfortable in the winter months, so take a swim and enjoy the Cafe!"}
{"text":"The lunch I was looking for. Fresh salad with tasty dressings and bejeweled with crispy veggies and toppings. We all ordered salad and shared the popcorn chicken, which came with the tummies sauces. The tea/coffee service was perfection! The service was quick and attentive. Go here for a moment of peace."}
{"text":"Do not like to line up and wait 30 minutes to be seated and see so many empty tables. Obviously they are short staffed. Our waiter was rushed. Service just OK.  Food Excellent. I has a delicious Shrimp Thai Salad. But come on $16 for a tiny Bloody Mary.  Ouch I feel gauged.  Will not recommend.  Sorry to bad. Way to many places to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"While staying at The Bellagio, myself and my two friends dined here for breakfast. It was about 10:00am on a Tuesday, and they were fairly busy, but not overly so. We were seated right away, then waited about ten minutes for a server to greet us, so we went ahead and ordered both our drinks and dishes at the same time. I had the seasonal fruit and yogurt panna cotta, and my friends had the breakfast sandwich (comes with a side of mixed fruit), the papaya fruit bowl, plus a side of scrambled eggs and sausage.  The food arrived quickly enough, but was incredibly disappointing. The panna cotta was just odd...not sweet at all (reminded me more of a gelatinized sour cream than anything else). My friend commented that the croissant on her sandwich reminded her of a lesser version of a Costco croissant. None of the fruit was ripe AT ALL. Everything was all average to below average, which would have been disappointing, but not terrible, except it came out to be about $20.00 per person. How can you not even manage ripe fruit at that price point?   After suffering through our lackluster breakfast we stacked our plates and waited for the check. And waited. And waited. I won't say this was our server's fault, as he was running around and seemed quite busy (although he clearly noticed we were finished more than once). Come on, though. If you need more waitstaff then hire some! We are at The Bellagio, which is supposed to be a paragon of luxury in Vegas (I think, right? Am I wrong? I've consistently been disappointed by them, so maybe they aren't?). We honestly waited at least 15 minutes (I feel like it was 20-25, but my friend says 15, so I'll be generous in my estimate). The only reason we even got the check was because we eventually just flagged him down. $60+ later we were finally on our way..."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick lunch at the pool.  Shaded tables with misters made lunch at noon bearable and the service was great.  The gyro itself isn't amazing mainly due to the meat and a lack of flavor or seasoning.  It's a bit bland and your local Greek place at home probably has a better version.  The pita fries with hummus that come with the gyro are AMAZING.  The burger is also super flavorful and tastes like it was grilled over open flame.  Yummy."}
{"text":"***************************** 1430 ***************************    Located by the right side of the entrance, by the smaller pools and courtyards. The Pool Cafe is open Spring through the beginning of Fall.     Light American fare, serving breakfast and lunch. Good cocktails and food. Try the smoked salmon, the grilled chicken sandwich, and the chicken pie.     It's much more relax than the Bellagio Cafe in the Garden Conservatory area. Plus you got to see a few hot ladies in bikinis and a few old fat men in Speedo too, quite a view!"}
{"text":"We had the oatmeal and yogurt parfait. Both were excellent. Service was top notch.  Atmosphere was amazing.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I took the time to read reviews on the different Bellagio options...other Yelpers were spot on with their thoughts on the Bellagio Pool Cafe.  Ambiance is great. We went swimming and then stopped in for breakfast right after. Thanks to the casual outdoor setting nobody looked twice at the frizzy disaster called my hair.  Service is friendly and food came out quickly. No complaints here.  Food was delicious and fresh. I had two poached eggs, with a side of hashbrowns and potatoes. My daughter had the corned beef hash. Everything was great.   I hesitate to mention my only complaint, which is that charging $7.50 for a glass of orange juice is simply ludicrous. But I suppose I should have asked the price before ordering it.  Overall I loved my breakfast experience this morning and wouldn't hesitate to return."}
