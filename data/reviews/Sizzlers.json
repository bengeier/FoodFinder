{"text":"Firstly, this place deliveries VERY late, so you have to give them some credit for that.

At first glance though if you go in person, is that this place is the most unimpressive.... BUT, I have gotten to know some of the food there well.

Their gyro is absolutely one of my favourites in the city.  It's kinda neither of a Greek style, nor a Middle East style.  I just love that the gyro slices they make, are afterwards grilled on a flame grill, before being wrapped with onion, tomato, and tzatziki.  My mouth waters just remembering it.

Anther thing going for this place... CHEAP.  One of the cheapest places I order from.

The only complaint I have with them sometimes is when I order, the guys that delivery the food for them can be total fucking knobs.  EI, confusion at the door, can't buzz in, I go to meet them downstairs, and in the meantime, they leave the lobby, so I'm chasing them around.
Despite all that, I shamelessly continue to order from them though."}
{"text":"I went to Toronto to visit a homie and it got super late.  I went to the front desk of his building and talked to a smooth Indian guy who told me that Sizzlers was the titts.  I had to believe him after all, he was an Indian.  So I walked down the street and scoped this place.

I ordered the philly steak.  They made it FRESH and hot right there.  They put some ill mushrooms in it and peppers and whatnot and spiced it up for me.  My mouth waters just thinking about it right now.  It was so correct!  There was a girl with a super thick ass in there waiting on some snacks, I was trying to spit game to her and show her my award winning break dancer moves.  She wasn't interested but the dudes behind the counter didn't call the cops on me so they get an extra star for that.  

Don't believe the haters, this place is 2 legit 2 quit.  Order the philly steak spicy and while you wait you can go outside and punch out a couple of bums down the street in the Toronto equivalent of Times Square for asking you for change.  Do I LOOK like I have SPARE CHANGE?  I ONLY USE CREDIT CARDS SON!!!"}
{"text":"I have tried to order 3 times from this place and it's been horrible.last time I called they were hacking on the phone.the times I got food you could barely eat it."}
{"text":"Been going here since it was called Steak Out...proper..the hamburger is huge, the portion of fries is huge...but if ur serious get the bbq chicken as they actually put it on a grill...never had to worry about the delivery guys as I live across the street from the joint...its a diner style spot but they make a proper salad"}
{"text":"One of the best late night destinations in the area, Sizzlers is open until 5am, making it an instant favourite for night owls and people stumbling home after a night of drinking.  Their burgers are delicious, but my favourite would have to be the chicken Caesar that they serve.

When you walk in, it looks a bit like a makeshift operation with the scattered chairs in the seating area in the back, but it really isn't.  These guys have been running this place for years and really seem to have their work down to a science.

Whether you're hammered, tipsy, or not, this place always serves you some greasy goodness that's sure to satisfy whatever ails you."}
{"text":"The other reviews on here had kept me from trying this place for a while, so I figured I'd give in and give it a run. I ordered the club, a poutine and a drink.

First off, this place gets an extra star. I placed my order online with just-eat.ca and within 10 minutes of sending off my order and paying for it, I got a call from the restaurant to make sure that I was okay with the toppings that were included and that it was ready whenever I was (early btw). The website didn't offer a toppings option, but I thought it was great that they called to make sure I'd be happy with what I got. I also asked for extra mayo on the side in my online order and I got it - an entire container :) They also packaged my cold pop separately from the hot food and in its own paper bag to keep it from making everything else cold. The little things!!

The good: the sandwich was on a really nice fresh kaiser bun, two pieces of nice, thin chicken, a good amount of bacon and fresh toppings (tomato, lettuce, etc). The poutine was nice and cheesy. Both of them were great portion sizes (I wasnt able to finish either).

The bad: While I like cheese on a club, it was processed and there was a bit too much of it. It probably would have been better without it. The gravy was really lumpy and thin and the fries could have been cooked longer.

Overall, not a fantastic meal, but I'll be sure to try them out again when I feel like a gyro or caesar, two of the things recommended in other reviews. The fact that its around the corner is good and that the staff was really nice when I came in is a plus too."}
