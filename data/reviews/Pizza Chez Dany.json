{"text":"I personally thought this place was terrible. I ordered 2 cheese slices and I could barely eat it. I felt that the cheese and sauce tasted cheap....I certainly didn't think it was tasty or anything like that."}
{"text":"Super good cheap pizza!   No frills, no seats, nothing more than a counter and about six selections of pizza.  Had the spinach cheese pizza for $2.50 and it was delicious!   The dough has a slight sweet flavour and I recommend it for mid day or late night snacking!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better hole-in-the-wall pizza places in that part of town. I used to stop by there all time the on the way to the train station.   The slices have always been a little bit more expensive than other places, but the size of the slice and the taste usually trumps it.   Also, the sesame seeds on the crust are a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great pizza for cheap that doesn't taste cheap! I tried the spinach pizza and got parm, pepper flakes, and oil sprinkled on top. It was delicious. The crust was very thin which is exactly what I was in the mood for. I got two slices and a pop (soda for the Americans out there) for $7 even. It was good hot food that hit the pizza craving I was having. I almost wish I lived in Montreal so I could have this pizza more often!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza ive ever ate.  Even if one of my piece seemed a bit old, the flavour was heavenly. I am also not a huge fan of pizza and ive disliked almost every other pizza i ate, but this one was just perfect. The mix of every flavours made it divinely tasty. We got 3 pieces and a water bottle for under 10$. Basic cheese, garlic and spinach(THE BEST)! and onions&mushrooms.  Everyone around seemed to know this was the best pizza place. The lineup can be long but we went there on an afternoon and it was just a couple minutes."}
{"text":"Horrible pie. Only thing in common with NY pizza is the thickness. We wanted a pepperoni slice and bacon slice and he only had mushroom/olive and spinach with bechamel sauce. The dough was extremely dry with no chew to it. It tasted worse than pre-made rounds you'd buy at the grocery store. Hard to find any cheese on either slice. Only a trace of sauce on each slice. Each of us only ate half it was that bad. Not a fan of places like Dominos or other chains so looked forward to this based on some positive reviews. Even if I'd been loaded at 2 a.m. it would not have hit the spot."}
{"text":"Whoever said this rivals New York pizza must not have any taste buds! I'm actually from NYC and this place is worse than any place I've ever been to in New York. I went to this place when I was visiting Montreal with friends and this place was down the block. I got 2 slices (one bacon and the other chicken). I ate the bacon one and was not able to finish it. It made me sick. If this is good for Montreal pizza then I would suggest not to eat pizza in Montreal or at least don't compare it to New York. Go to Montreal for the poutine not the pizza."}
{"text":"God I could eat this pizza everyday for the rest of my life. I don't know what they put that crust of theirs, but its amazing. Its a little bit sweet, and compliments perfectly with the toppings. My favorite is the white cheddar and spinach (and I'm not even a fan of white cheddar or spinach).    $6 for two slices of pizza and a drink, what more can you ask for ?"}
{"text":"Best spinach garlic pizza ever!!  Visit the guys for fabulous service and a delicious slice!"}
{"text":"$3.5 for a slice of burnt crust topped with some oddly sweet and thick cream. Their signature and garlic spinach pie is quite successful with flies.  This is not pizza, it's breadstick"}
{"text":"Solid \"NYC Style\" pizza in Montreal. My buddies and I were in town for the weekend for a bachelor's party.   Since we got a noise violation from playing beer pong past 10 pm, we started playing  at noon the following day.   What better way cure a hangover than with more beer pong accompanied by pizza. A quick Yelp search found Chez Dany, a stone's throws from our Sheraton hotel.   The people at Chez Dany were friendly. I saw that a bunch of locals were ordering, so that's a good sign. Credit cards accepted.  Nice.   We ended up ordering two jumbo pizzas. Each one was $20 and was a good value since each pizza consisted of 8 large slices.   We got one bacon and one sausage pizza. Both were excellent. Thin and airy, but crispy crust that held up with the toppings.  Not too greasy, but full of meaty flavor. The sprinkles parmesan cheese also added a nice touch.        Needless to say, the two pies were consumed quickly and everyone asked us where we ordered it from."}
{"text":"The prices are superb and obviously thought out to please students.  The pizza is the best I've ever had in my whole life hands down and absolutely no competition. It was just SUPERB. Three choice of FREE toppings of which I always choose Parmesan.  THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO SIT AT. It's literally a hole in the wall take-out pizza place. Cash only, it takes mere minutes to prepare and it is almost always fresh out of the oven. Beverages are cheap if combined with the slices of Pizza.  An absolute must if you're walking by and hungry.  Careful, you might need to wait outside if there are too many people in the waiting line. (Yes that's how small that place is.)"}
{"text":"Could hands down be my favourite pizza place! No joke! All slices are $2.50, no matter what topping. Pizza is thick and crust has sesame seeds. I usually take plain cheese pizza and chicken pizza. I also always add free toppings to my pizza like parmesan and olive oil.  The place has no seats. It is just a counter. You just climb the 3 steps, order, pay and then leave. Really tiny place. They are quick so rarely have I ever gotten stuck in the line.  Usually stays open till 3am (or 4am) on weekends!  Note: They only take cash!"}
{"text":"Rude rude rude waited an hour for a pizza while they gave others special service who were there for ten minutes , asked them why it was taking so long and they were so cold and rude never again..assholes"}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places. Depending on what type of pizza you want because at times I want thin crust, thick crust, so many different styles! Today will be a sweet crust with sesame seeds and all dressed. This place is all in the dough!!! Check It out..:))"}
{"text":"This tiny place is where I got my first slice of pizza in Montreal on a visit about 3 years ago now. It really set the tone for that sleazy downtown Montreal vibe with a peep show right next door and the Bell center just down the road. The price of the slices hasn't gone up since then, still $2.50 for any variety. The crust here is above par, and the spinach pizza is my fav. Get all the fixings - pepper flakes, parmesan, and olive oil - and chow down."}
{"text":"So I've been to Chez Dany a couple dozen times over the past 4 years since I went to school nearby and It's about time I left a review.   I have to admit that I kept going back for their spinach garlic pizza because it's honestly the best spinach pizza ever. Their chicken pizza is also something that's notably good but a little on the salty side so be careful.   The customer service has almost always been great. I say almost because the last time I went left a bad after taste. It was a new employee, an unfamiliar face that served me and a friend and oh my goodness....that man had such a bad attitude. They usually ask if you want any Parmesan, chilli flakes or olive oil on your slices when you order but the man was quick to wrap them in a brown paper bag without any questions so I asked that he please add them. The minute he heard me, he sighed out loud and went \"oh cmon\".   Needless to say that was just one bad experience out of several pleasant ones. The other workers are still a lot nicer. Get there before the lunch time rush or else you'll be waiting out in the cold."}
{"text":"I can't tell if it was genuinely delicious or if we were just all so blasted from the night that we couldn't tell the difference. The line up combined with everyone saying it was the most delicious certainly helped me decide it was damn tasty.  It resulted in the group I visited with coming by here twice in two nights. It helps that it's right on a prime corner to stumble past.  Overall the pizza was tasty and prices were decent, the only thing not so fun is the stairs and small platform you stand upon is a little too small when people are tipsy and stumbling."}
{"text":"This is my new drunk munchies spot. It's SO good. You NEED to get the spinach pizza, my friend told me to order it but I was skeptical so I only got one slice but then I regretted not getting 2."}
{"text":"I stopped by this hole in the wall (literally) pizza stand during the Grand Prix. There are no places to sit, you walk up to the counter, place your order, pay, take your pizza and go. If you don't like to eat on the run or find it difficult to do so, then this place is not for you.   I ordered a slice of all-dressed pizza and a can of Coca-Cola for a little under five dollars. The pizza was fresh and hot and the cola ice cold. I did not like the poppy seeds they put on the crust, otherwise, the pizza was ok. Ultimately, I would consider this place to be another dollar store type pizza parlour that is located on practically every corner in the city today. This one was perhaps a cut above the rest."}
{"text":"So I stopped by for a slice.  I choose an all dressed pizza.  As I'm waiting at the cash a Rat or mouse comes from the kitchen and makes for the door (I couldn't tell cuz it happened so fast).   I freak out. Tell the worker I just saw a rodent and want a refund for my slice and he looks at me and says NO REFUND.  I kindly walk away disgusted and in disbelief.  I will never, ever eat there again. Save yourself the trauma and go somewhere else for you slice of pizza."}
{"text":"I waited for four hours in the blistering cold and asked for crushed red pepper and you still said no... the pizza is pretty shitty man they had no pepperoni pizza he likes it more than I do... I ain't that mad but I just don't like getting diabetes. The customer service was good nothing bad to say .. but the pizza tasted like frozen diabetes with sesame seeds."}
{"text":"This will be the worst experience of your entire life. I paid 18 dollars (with tip) for this poutine. The fries are undercooked and soggy, the cheese tastes like plastic and it smells terrible.   I don't see how places like this can continue to get away with this low level of quality. It was not even cheap."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about.  We had two random people tell is this was the best pizza in Montreal.  The space is cool because it's literally a hole in the wall.   The slices look delicious and probably taste as good after a few drinks.  The crust was good but the rest was not up to par.  Pass."}
{"text":"TLDR: Great spot for a slice of late night pizza on De la Montagne just under St. Catherine.   Pizza Chez Danny makes tasty pizza that will squash your late night craving. The crust is thin and crisp on the bottom, but soft on top. The addition of sesame seeds on the top adds a delicious nuttiness to every bite of the sweet crust. The mixed cheese of the simple cheese pizza melts into yummy goodness and sits on a light dose of tomato sauce. With tax, the slice came out to around $3, and it was delicious. I definitely recommend this place for your Americanized pizza itch."}
{"text":"This is the best sliced pizza I've had so far in all of Montreal.  This is NOT a place for you to go and sit in, or spend time. There is actually nowhere to sit. It's a hole in the wall. But if you're walking through downtown, or late after drinks etc, this is your place.  Sliced pizza is SO good here. Almost always fresh, and they grate parmesan on top. Super yum. $3 too."}
{"text":"Good cheap pizza? No. Just cheap. It was a hole in a wall - literally - and after renovations, it's just a clean hole in the wall. The sauce has this sweetness to it that's actually sickening and the toppings - what little of it there is - are over powered by the sauce's foul taste, even bacon which is usually the one overpowering other ingredients. Please pack your knives and leave."}
{"text":"Edible but nothing to rave about. Really, were some of you guys drunk as fuck when you ate this or published reviews?  I was expecting a delicious white spinach pizza...but noooo just cheap cheap below average pizza. 3$ a slice of white spinach."}
{"text":"For cheapie pizza this is one of the best places in the city. They are small with a good selection. They add olive oil or parmesan cheese or spicy peppers on top for free. I think if you're stuck and need something quick, good and cheap this is a good option. No date night material but reliable food when in a rush and stuck."}
{"text":"This is a very very small hole-in-the-wall that was conveniently located near the hotel I was staying at in Montreal.  After a night of partying and drinks, having a pizza place here was a plus for all my friends and myself.  The pizza itself tastes a little sweet and it was just good enough for us to be satisfied with food.  The dough itself is average, but I'm spoiled by good New York pizza in my area.  All in all, if you are drunk and need food, come here.  It should be good enough to satisfy you and the price is not too bad.  One of my friends did come by here during the day to see how the pizza holds up when you are more sober, and yes, I did have a bite of it as well.  I can honestly say it does taste better when drunk, so keep this place reserved for those late nights out after partying!"}
{"text":"Blah, I don't even know where to start with this review... All night, passing by or driving by, I saw lineups of folks waiting outside. (Oh gee! This place must be great!) NOPE. We order an entire pizza, made fresh.   Honestly, the cheese was great! C'est parfait! But the crust or the dough as they make it, somehow it tasted sweet like sugar mixed with cardboard WAY too much. I've had better pizza from Pizza Hut or PizzaPizza."}
{"text":"For the love of pizza. This place rivals New York pizza places. It's perfect. Sweet but savory. Satisfying and addicting."}
