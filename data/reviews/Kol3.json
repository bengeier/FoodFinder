{"text":"Banh Xeo is awesome! Highly recommend this restaurant on the strength of this dish alone. The chef knows her flavours and I was very impressed. The restaurant is colorful and functional but more of a casual setting. The price point is also right for the amount of food and the quality."}
{"text":"The ladies than I assume own this place, really are dedicated to good customer service, and really do their job well. A gf and i were in a -sort of- rush before a concert, and were talking between ourselves while looking over the menu of the counter. The woman who worked there picked up on it, and confirmed she'd be able to get our meal out to us within 10 minutes, and that she did. She was so friendly, and answered my gf's questions about the menu as she had never been there before.
We sat and as mentioned 10 minutes later, were served, though the quality of the food was not compromised. They asked us how our meals were twice, and if we needed anything else, and at the same time were not intrusive.
The food was consistently excellent. My gf, whose Vietnamese, even confirmed they make the banh xeo like she had in Vietnam, and that it was authentic tasting. I can't compliment this place enough."}
{"text":"Good food, server seemed a little inexperienced (? son of owners), but overall, a nice place in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and cant believe Ive forgotten to review it until now. My first visit was a commendation from my sister. I went in after getting my hair done around the corner at Cutting Room Floor and the place was empty. The specialty at Kol3 is Bahn Xeo, vietnamese crepe. Who doesnt love crepes? Its not your typical crepe as its made with rice flour and coconut milk, plus it has more of a deep fried taste, but who doesnt love deep fried? I had a vietnamese coffee and a traditional crepe with chicken to go. The funny part was, the young lady at the front asked me if I had been in before. I hadnt, but my twin sister had, and I thought it was really sweet she \"remembered\" me. The crepe I ate when I got home, and even cold it was delicious. The thing was huge, plus it came with a salad, so definately satitsfying and dare I say, more filling sometimes than your standard Vietnamese fare. 
I will say that going in, the decor is not what I consider traditional Vietnamese. Its all white walls and furniture accented with bright pops of colour. Its also maybe a little more pricey than the average restaurant, but so worth it as Ive never seen these offered anywhere else.

The second visit was with my mom, sister, aunt and friend Mike. Again, awesome service, so friendly and everyone had a smile on their face. I had the Athena, and the others at the table had the traditional, or the Bacon Cheeseburger (!) crepe. All were delicous, but mine was the best. Just the right amount of spinach, chicken, onion and feta inside. I didnt catch the name of the hot sauce the young lady handed our table, but it was amazing. I dont like spicy anything really, but this complimented everyones crepe nicely. I forgot to mention that the Vietnamese Coffee is well done. Its strong, and not too sweet. They serve it premixed (other places Ive been let you do it yourself)
So, if you're looking for something a little different, Kol3 is definately it."}
{"text":"Delicious and well priced, Vietnamese crepe was good and so was the pho and desserts. The crepe comes with chicken/beef/or pork along with a load of veggies (bean sprouts). 

The decor is a very much IKEA style but it makes a great casual feeling to the locale. 

The pho size was a bit smaller than at most Vietnamese restaurants and acts more as an accompaniment to the crepe rather than a stand along meal. 

Desserts were surprisingly good and made in house. Had the cheesecake and the chocolate cake, both were light and tasty.  

The salad rolls were chewy. Wouldn't order again.

For appetizer, entree & dessert, the bill per person was around $20, very good value.

{"text":"I stopped by one rainy evening for a quick dinner with my sister. We tried the pho sate soup, veggie spring rolls, beef and shrimp salad rolls, and the wings. Everything was really tasty, and very well priced. 

I have been picking up the pho sate beef soup on a weekly basis now, I just can't get enough. The small size is perfect for a light dinner. I think they put coconut milk (??) in the broth, because it is so nice and creamy. My only complaint is that there is not enough beef in the small soup! I haven't tried the crepes yet, the soup is just too tempting."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is fantastic.   I had searched for vietnamese (looking for a place around me) and picked a restaurant based on it's reviews, and proximity, of course.  Kol3 did not disappoint. 

We ordered a starter of vegetarian salad rolls, which were absolutely fantastic.  With yam, daikon, tofu, lettuce, and the regular suspects, plus some basil (which is my fave thing to be included with vietnamese food!), I was in heaven!  My only complaint (and the bf's too) is that they could have had some condiments on the table such as sriracha, hoisin, etc.  We love our food spicy.

The bf had a basa fish banh xeo, and I had the veggie banh xeo.  They were both delicious!  The basa was perfectly cooked, and the crepe around it was deliciously crispy and soft at the same time.  The veggie banh xeo came with a delicious stuffing of vegetables and was amazingly fresh and savoury at the same time.   

I would definitely recommend paying Kol3 a visit if you are in the area.  We plan to go back next time we are looking for some delicious vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Was back at Kol3 after a long absence.   What a terrific spot for vietnamese food with a twist.
The pho was terrific as was the \"Vietnamese crepe\"  
this is a favorite of mine-------love the owner and the family working there"}

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

With a Vietnamese Pho restaurant on every street, it's finally refreshing to see something different! Kol3 specializes in Banh Xeo, a traditional Vietnamese style crepe stuffed with various fillings. Even better, is that their crepes are gluten free!

Kol3's décor is very modern, crisp, and clean with bursts of colourful walls and chairs. It's a very small \"café\" with seating for about 20 people at white plastic tables. The remaining half of the restaurant is taken up by a giant counter where you can view the chefs cooking. A giant plastic sign describing what Banh Xeo was is prominently displayed next to the door. The service was great - the food came out fresh and hot; and the servers were friendly and casual.   

Their menu consists of 6 different gluten free crepes ($11.50), pho ($6 SM / $8 LG), and traditional Vietnamese apps like spring/salad rolls. The crepes are large and comes with a side of fresh salad drizzled with a delicious citrus vinaigrette. This meal will definitely fill you up!

I tried their 'Traditional' (pork, shrimp, onions, mushroom, bean sprouts, and mung beans); 'Bacon Cheeseburger' (ground beef, bacon, cheese, onions, tomatoes, and pickles); and 'Athena' (chicken, onions, feta, and spinach) crepes. 

Overall, the crepes were amazing! It was nice and crispy (not too eggy), and had a light coconut taste with turmeric to add colour. I usually don't eat gluten free, but this was a fantastic alternative to a starchy flour crepe. Of the three fillings, my favourite was the Athena where the feta cheese added an extra creaminess. The Bacon Cheeseburger was very 'generic' and messy to eat. 

My only negatives are that: 
1. The crepes didn't hold together well and was a bit soggy from the filling; and
2. They were a tad bland, but the dish really came together and popped with flavour with a drizzle of the accompanying fish sauce.

If you want to try something new, I recommend you visit Kol3 to try out their creative and tasty crepes!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I find it annoying when waiters hover around and smother me with \"Do you need anything?\" \"Is there anything else I can get you?\" in either because they were afraid I might not tip them or someone previously complained about their demeanour and they're on the last straw. Sometimes I get pushed to the brink of annoyance that I just respond with something weird, like \"yes I need assurance that society won't crumble into dust\" or \"is the universe empty or is it a limitless supply of everything?\" which gives them something to think about before they come back with my bill.

At Kol3 they effortlessly go out of their way in making patrons comfortable in their visit, but in a natural manner. Theres warmth and authenticity in how they engage their customers and this is the kind of environment you can only get from passionate small businesses.

The dishes are great, their main specialty is the Banh Xeo crepes which I barely find in any Vietnamese restaurant. I had the traditional filling -shrimp, sprouts, mung beans, onions, and mushrooms with beef. It was delicious, light, and filling. They provide you with a fish sauce mix as condiment but I didn't find myself pouring it into the dish, it was that fresh and tasty.

Their Iced Vietnamese Coffee was also refreshing as I enjoyed it outside where they have table seating which made it a pleasant Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Loved Kol3! My friend had noodle soup and liked it a lot, but it was my Asian crepe with shrimp, pork, sprouts and other vegetables which made me want to come back for more. Delicious! The waitress was friendly and the decore was bright and colourful in an plastic Asian funky sort of way. Don't miss it's slightly out of the way location on a side street just off Kensington Road."}
{"text":"Had a great Pho Sate Beef and really good spring pork rolls. Really happy with the service and the place is clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Yum.  That is all.  Well, almsot...

I'm a big fan of Vietnamese food Calgary-style generally, so was excited for something new at Kol3.  These crepe-like dishes are kind of crunchy, full of fresh veggies & meats, ready quickly and super yummy.

This restaurant does eat in and take out.  Staff are friendly and attentive.  Prices aren't bad - $11-13 per dish.

To top it all off, most dishes are gluten and dairy free!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow.

Let's start with the basics...what's a banh xeo and why is she is impressed?

This asian dish is most similar to a crepe but it's made of rice flour and coconut milk (optional). The wrap is neither sweet or fluffy like a crepe. The staple ingredients in the fillings are bean sprouts and lettuce. Then your choice of meat. Pretty simple right? So then why is it so hard to find at regular restaurants?!!?! 

Well now Calgary has it's own place to claim it's Banh Xeo home. Kol3 serves up a mean dish of banh xeo. You think $13 is a lot for a meal? This bad boy comes in a small pizza box and is loaded with enough ammo to free a small village. Always the right consistency, slammed with freaking fresh cold bean sprouts, piping hot meat of choice, drizzled in savoury nuoc cham (sauce). This is the perfect health food. Doesn't get fresher than this. 

The final star? Goes to excellent service."}
{"text":"What is this place? And how in the world do I say 'Banh Xeo'? Thanks to sign by the door, I know it's Bun-say-oh. I can order my sizzling Asian crepe without having to call it a crepe. Translated, this means sizzling cake.

Bright greens, blues and pinks complement a mostly white decor (except for the ocean blue feature wall). It feels cheerful, perfect for the first of our spring weather! I'm a fan already.

Not long after I am seated, a tall glass of water shows up at my side.

I order the traditional crepe with pork. 'Good choice' my server says with approval. My Vietnamese iced coffee is also delicious. Like an iced cap, only so much better.

Today's dessert special reads a white chocolate fudge torte for $6. The menu board also boasts that it's gluten free. If that were an important point for me, I'd be ecstatic. But I know it's an important point for many of you, I hope you are ecstatic in my place. Remember the sign by the door? It also mentions that the cakes are made from rice flour, turmeric powder, coconut milk and water. This sounds like your kind of place.

Seating is sparse, I count 7 tables in all, but that shouldn't stop you from ordering your Banh Xeo to go.

The server shows up in front of me with a small plate. \"Is that my crepe? Really?\" I wonder. Turns out not. She's brought me a complimentary plate of spring rolls as she apologizes for the wait for my meal. \"They keep burning the crepe,\" she explains apologetically. I'm thankful for her proactive approach to service.

I bite into my freshly cooked spring rolls and think: \"If my Banh Xeo is anything like these spring rolls, I'm in for a treat.\"

My meal arrives but a few minutes later. It looks more like an omelette. The crepe part is crispy and eggy rather than thin and doughy. It's full of sprouts, shrimp, pork and beans. It takes up half of my full-sized plate and comes with fish sauce to pour over it. 

My server checks in to find out how everything is tasting. It's delicious. I polish up my plate and finish off my iced coffee. I've made a mental note to come back on a hot summer day the next time any of my friends try and suggest a Timmy's iced cap. 

My total bill is around $15, a little more with GST. I leave feeling satisfied, both with the healthy and hearty food as well as the friendly service."}
{"text":"I went here with no idea what \"banh xeo\" was and no idea this place existed. I left smiling.

First of all, the service: wow. Some of the best service I've received in a long time.

The guy serving was incredibly attentive and SO friendly to the point I wondered if he was the owner. His disposition set the tone for the meal - we let him know we were in a rush and he wasted no time getting us seated and getting menus in our hands. Now to be clear: I'm into women. But if this guy had asked if I wanted to hold hands and skip down Kensington Ave with him, I wouldn't have refused him. He was just that nice.

Funky decor, nice and bright and very, very clean. A simple layout with big windows.

I'd never had a vietnamese crepe before, but I figure if you're going out for something like that you'd better order the original. They have some \"western\" options, but I went straight for the legit experience and I was NOT disappointed.  Big servings, delicious crepes, fresh ingredients - and all the hot sauce I could ever need.  It's not the neatest meal - you'll probably get something on your face/clothes/the table. But it's delicious.

Unfortunately as I mentioned we were in a rush, so we were in and out fast - and left big tips.

I'll definitely be back when I'm in the mood for something a little different in Kensington!"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened up around the corner from my work. While I had encountered the very friendly staff, in our shop, I was hesitant to give them a visit because as a vegan, I am generally wary of the hidden fish  sauce and so forth in Vietnamese food, and would hate to disturb such a delicious cuisine with my dietary requests.
I am very glad I went in. I was greeted by the friendly Kol3 staff, and the interior is beautiful. Modern, poppy, and simple. Their menu board displayed that they had Banh Xeo (savoury crepes), Vietnamese subs, salad rolls, soup, etc. They also have delicious teas, coffees, and organic dry sodas and things on hand.
Since I am kind of a Vietnamese n00b aside from the occasional pho place that is sympathetic to my kind, I basically just asked them to make me something meat, dairy, egg, fish free. Lucky for me, they were very accomodating and were able to make me a vegan Banh Xeo which was a new experience! It was a lovely crepe filled with bean sprouts, veggies, and crispy tofu. She even replaced the fish sauce on the side with a vegan friendly kind, As someone who normally cooks at home and dabbles in raw food a lot, the food itself was a little heavy on the oil for me, and I have found myself a few hours later with a headache, but I feel this may just be the adjustment on my body. I am unclear on their msg situation, forgot to ask.
I considered trying a dry soda which looked delicious, but I had some ginger pu-erh tea on hand which caters well to this kind of cuisine, I find.
Try this place for something new. Good luck, new little Kol3 restaurant! :)"}
