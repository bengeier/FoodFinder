{"text":"Love this place!! Great service and the food is always fresh! The parking is limited during lunch time, but great location!! There is always plenty of seating available. Definitely one of my favorite places to get poke."}
{"text":"Just got in town and stumbled across this cool place.  Delicious flavors, excellent fresh fish and generous portions at a reasonable price.  Thrilled to find such a tasty healthy choice on campus!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on a business trip last week between meetings. Very highly recommend. Great quality, good prices; makes a the craving for sushi accessible at lunch!  Bring it up to Denver!"}
{"text":"BEST POKE IN TOWN 1st in line for Saturdays grand opening. The owner came out and greeted my family personally and bought us lunch. Super thanks.. 23 hours to go for our free 20 bowls, cant wait. Just had lunch and the bowl was FANTASTIC...,.The Tuna and Salmon were to die for, fresh and plenty of it. Watch out for the wasabi super spicy but it completes the meal."}
{"text":"Great location closed to ASU campus and Biodesign Institute. Good to go for lunch. Had the regular half and half (half brown rice and half salad) with shrimp kimchi and salmon + house spicy sauce. Yum! A little bit pricey though but the portion is big, for me."}
{"text":"Offers healthy food with a great taste.  I had a large bowl with half and half of rice and salad. You can choose three types of sea food with large bowl and two types of sea food with regular bowl.  Both bowls csn have different types of toppings such as fish eggs. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place with my boyfriend for a date night.  Being our first time the lady at the counter was friendly and walked us through how to order, and what our choices were.  He likes his food more spicy while I do not. I ordered the regular which comes with two scoops of your choice of seafood. I ordered shrimp and tuna, boyfriend ordered yellow tail and spicy tuna.  They do charge you an extra $1 for a small scoop of avocado.  We both ordered white rice.  Overall we were impressed and happy with our food choices. Staff seemed knowledgeable and friendly.  The place itself is fresh and clean.  We will most likely be back again."}
{"text":"I am terminally ill, and they are always so kind to me, even when my friend goes to pick up my order. Always ask how I am doing, generous portions and always caring. I highly recommend there food. Delicious and so many selections to tailor to anyones medically issues. ET, Peter,and Travis are all sweet and wonderful to be honored to have them make my food for me. So grateful. Best poki place, even my native Hawaiian friend that is chef loves there food. Give them a shot. Also door dash always delivers there food and they are very good at reading all the notes.  thank you again  koko"}
{"text":"Pros: Not sure what some of the other reviewers are talking about because I've gotten full scoops each time I've come here. Employees are friendly.  Cons: employees are slow. Yellowtail is extra $1. Scoop of crab is less than half of the scoop of avocado. Scallops were chewy, obviously been sitting out or been defrosting. Gave me a Thai tea with no ice - I noticed this when I walked away from the register but honestly just wanted to get out of there. And they do this thing where they close the container even tho pieces of the salad is sticking out of it and that just bothers me so much.  I used to love ahipoki in Scottsdale and chandler and now I think There are other, better places."}
{"text":"Good food. Fish was fresh and vegetables were crisp. The normal sized portion was too much for me,  which is good. Thai tea was good, but not anything special. Downside is that the parking lot is horribly small and there is a dutch bro coffee so there is always a line of cars blocking the lot. This would fare better in a different lot. Very close to ASU Tempe campus, walking or biking distance."}
{"text":"I love this place! Ever since I was a student at ASU to now, a working professional. I splurged with my sister and we loved our dinners. I got the large plate ($11.50 - comes with 3 scoops of seafood) with half organic salad and half brown rice. For my seafood, I got the Tuna Luau, Yellowtail (extra $1), and Salmon with the sweet citrus sauce. My sister got the same thing except had 2 scoops of salmon instead of the yellowtail. I also ordered a Thai tea ($2.99) and at the end, went back for a green tea macaron ice cream sandwich ($2.50). I don't recall the exact prices of the drink and dessert but I think it was around these.   The brown rice was fluffy and cooked to perfection. The tuna luau doesn't get mixed in with the sauce you select but the other fishes/shrimp/etc. do. The sweet cirrus tasted wonderful with the fish and salad. It mimicked a sweet lemon vinaigrette. The fish was very tender and their flavors were enhanced with the sauce. I loved every bite. You can choose your toppings, I chose all of them. My favorites are the crab salad, seaweed salad, edamame, and seaweed topping.   Overall, I'd come back here if I have the financial flexibility to spend a good amount. The portions were big and it was filling! It was also a better eating option than a fast food place. The customer service was phenomenal and the guys that helped me were Eric and Buddha, but the whole staff were very friendly and recommended certain choices for if I was feeling a certain thing. I really appreciated their expertise and their wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the largest portion sizes I've ever gotten for a poke bowl.  I got the half and half with salad and rice and they put it in a bento box with so much food??? And it was so cheap?? Wow I was pretty amazed because I'm used to small bowls.  Fish quality and sides were great, but rice quality wasn't the best. However, would recommend for those who are super hungry and need a filling meal."}
{"text":"Finally something like this opened right by the ASU Tempe Campus.  This place used to be a bookstore, I'm glad that they closed it and tore it down and opened up a food place.  Enjoyed very much and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I ate here last night with a friend. It tasted fine, but in the morning I was very sick. My friend wasn't and the only variation was that I got salmon and she didn't. I hadn't eaten anything but that before I got sick. Looking back on it, having raw food sitting out uncovered for who knows how long can't be safe. Pretty disappointed and feeling awful."}
{"text":"I've been eating keto for about a month and needed to satisfy my sushi craving. This did the trick! The staff was extremely helpful with advice and suggestions so we could put together a bowl that was satisfying and low in carbs."}
{"text":"Everything was good, but I had bones in my yellowtail. They have to make sure to leave out those pieces but otherwise very good and fresh"}
{"text":"Too overpriced, yellowtail is an extra dollar which is annoying, and they give you less food than pokedon just a few mins away which is also cheaper and doesn't charge $1 extra for yellowtail. If you have no way to go to pokedon then go here if you really want poke, otherwise I'd say it's just too overpriced"}
{"text":"The manager was super rude and just wanted me out of there. Super condescending. He made me feel so uncomfortable, I didint even want to ask for soy sauce. Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I try to be as fair as possible in my reviews and I will only post 3 stars or above reviews but what happened to me and my here was just wrong!  We always order the 3 scoops and pay extra for the avocado and the yellow tail.  While we have no issues paying extra, we do expect to get our full scoop of avocado and yellow tail. Instead, we got barely a scoop of avocado.  My husband got 3 pieces of yellow tail while I got 6 small pieces.  My husband looked at the guy and asked if he was serious and the guy told him yes and with an attitude no less!    How is this customer service and how does this justify the extra $1?  It does not.  Flavor, it is good.  Their house sauce can be on the saltier side.  I suggest garlic mirin.  Their rice is a hit and miss.  Sometimes is undercooked and other times is on point.  The seaweed salad can be a bit fishy though.    Their fish quality is ok.  Never had a bite of Poseidon's underpants at this place.  If you have the guts to tell them to not be stingy, then this place serves up a decent bowl of poke.  The upside is that they can't spit in your food because you will see it.    And yes, I truly realize this is a #firstworldproblem"}
{"text":"I had never tried poki before and now I am hooked because of Ahipoki! I love the combination of the warm rice with the cold ingredients! I also love how you can choose your own ingredients!"}
{"text":"I have a love for ahi tuna so couldn't wait to try this place. Had no idea what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. The staff was excellent at explaining the process to me and walking us through exactly how to order each step of the way. The spicy house sauce is the bomb! And everything was very fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant . There is lots of very fresh fish, and many many sides to put in it. It is spotless and has an inviting  atmosphere. Of course the bonus is that the food is very healthy."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my sister. I'm glad she showed it to me. I definitely enjoyed there food. I even had one of their desserts (the coffee icecream sandwich). While a bit pricey for it, was definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"First time trying Ahipoki and I definitely like the food here. The set up is very similar to Panda Express and Chipotle. You pick your rice, toppings, fish, and sauce.   First off, the service was a little rude. There was barley a line behind me and the staff was very rushing. It was my first time so of course I had questions and was reading what type of fish they have but the staff keeps rushing me. Maybe I went on a bad day???   Food was very good and the fish was fresh. But they were very stingy with the toppings. A large scoop wouldn't be so bad.... I really like the food but the staff was not my favorite.   Definitely would be back, Ahipoki is my favorite now!"}
{"text":"Poke is a pretty hot ticket at the moment, and one that lends itself well to this Chipotle-style setup of walking down a line and picking ingredients for a bowl. The staff was helpful and the process flowed pretty well. The number of protein choices was pretty expansive, too, allowing you to try something like octopus or tiny scallops in a non-threatening environment. The only thing I would have liked was maybe a small menu of pre-made bowls to help out people that aren't familiar with some of these ingredients so that they don't have to make a snap decision about whether they want masago or furikake in their bowl as an employee is staring at them waiting."}
{"text":"So good! Love the options and the sauces. So happy my office has moved to this side of campus so that I can go here more often."}
{"text":"I love ahipoki but the employees at this branch seem to be uncoordinated and do not communicate with each other. A guy asked me what I wanted, and told him I wanted half salad and half rice. After he put some in my plate, another girl came in and asked if I \"ordered extra salad\". I said no and she took off some. That was just one incident and every time , it feels real awkward. Other than that, the food quality is about the same. Quantity really varies though. I just hope to get a not skimpy person when I go. Also, ahipoki should really train their employees with good customer service. I do notice that their employees all look like they hate their jobs and that's in all branches."}
{"text":"WOW... this place is FANTASTIC! Delicious! Also great customer service to follow! Lovely place! Definitely will be back and 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Ahi poke - the chandler and Scottsdale locations  are awesome but the 2 times I have been here since it opened I have had a way smaller amount than at the other 2 locations. I am very disappointed. Usually I have leftovers.... They skimped on the salad, on the fish and on the toppings. Also the rice tasted and felt like it was a day old it was in chunks. Man am I disappointed bc I was so looking forward to having a closer location but I won't go back here. It's not worth my money. (Usually my container is overflowing with food and clearly this one is not.)"}
{"text":"Chipotle but Poke! I love the concept of Ahipoki Bowl. Pick a base (white rice, brown rice, salad, etc), seafood (Ahi, spicy tuna, scallops, etc), add some sides (avocado, cucumber salad, crab salad, etc) and a sauce (I always got the spicy house).  For $9, you receive 2 scoops of seafood in a bowl filled with healthy goodness.  To counteract the healthiness, ice cream filled macaroons are offered for dessert. Get the coffee flavored one. You're welcome. If poke is your thing, give Ahipoki bowl a try!"}
{"text":"I have been to all of the AhiPoki Bowl locations in the Valley and without a doubt, unequivocally the best site is Tempe, even though they all have the same fish, the same menu choices, the same garnishments and I order the bowl each time with the same ingredients this spot put them together the best. If I'm in Tempe this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I tried a poke bowl for the first time today and it was  amazing!! The guy who helped when I came in was super nice and helpful as the menu was pretty overwhelming being a first-time customer. I got a normal bowl with brown rice, shrimp, and their spicy house sauce. I tried a few toppings as well, such as edamame, red onions, crunchy green onions, etc.. So good!!  However, I'm giving them 3 stars because the woman who put my toppings on and checked me out was awfully  and very obviously rude. I didn't know what some of their toppings were, being that they weren't labeled, and because I was unfamiliar with a few (again being new). She seemed very annoyed by my indecisiveness, and when I asked her what some of the toppings were she answered, but very passively. When we checked out, the only thing she said to me was, \"$9.73\", as in my change. I didn't even get a response when I said, \"Thank you have a nice day\".   Again, the food was delicious and the gentleman was so nice, so I'll definitely be going back! But, the woman's poor attitude really made me feel unwelcome. She wasn't wearing a name tag, and I didn't want to annoy her more by asking, but if you go and a woman with reddish hair is putting your toppings on... make sure you know what you want."}
{"text":"Today was the first and last time I eat here, which is unfortunate because the food was delicious. While in line choosing our food my friend chose kimchi sauce to top her poke bowl and the worker told her that choosing the kimchi sauce was a mistake. As he moved on to the next person he said to his co worker \"the kimchi sauce is for shrimp, but she'll learn\". After we finished our meal the same worker came up and inquired about how she liked the kimchi sauce with her poke bowl. Unprofessional staff will run a trend into the ground. I'll take my food without the side of pretentious judgement please."}
{"text":"Ahi-amazing!! The ingredients were SO fresh - everything from the avocado, to the salmon, to the ahi, and all the vegetables! Not only was the bowl delicious, but also beautiful. I loved the portion size (I got a regular) and it was just the right amount of food.   I waited for months for ahipoki bowl to open, and I was not disappointed! Definitely give it a try!!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my sister who invited me to lunch and picked up the bill. This place is a good find if you late a Poke fan. I went with the bowl and ordered the half brown rice and half white rice topped with tuna. You then pick your sauce and toppings. Sauce can be made to your spice preference. You then move on to the toppings. And then dry spices.  I was quite impressed with the toppings and all the flavors seemed to come together and make for a great lunch.  The Poke gets a bit lost in the bowl and you get bits here and there but it is a great change to burgers, chicken and sandwiches. My o really experience was Plesant. Clean bathrooms, very modern fresh look and quick plesant service. I recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"....Lovin' the poki. Fresh.However, visited this place when they first opened and portions seemed more. This time portions were small. So a slight disappointment considering the cost. But good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Big tasty. Much healthy.  As an avid sushi lover, I was excited to try this interesting twist. Ahipoki did not disappoint. I choose the regular bowl with half mixed greens and half warm brown rice. Two proteins come with the regular bowl - three with a large -I chose a fresh and fatty salmon and some cooked shrimp. My server tossed those in my choice of sauce - I picked the house sauce which is a clean tasting Asian sesame-ginger-garlic-hosin. Moving down the line, there was an ample selection of toppings-and you could add as many as you wanted. I  chose fish eggs, pickled radish, edamame, cucumber, seaweed salad, pickled ginger, wasabi... And then finished with a sprinkling of crushed seaweed and sesame seeds. Everything was super fresh and served in the right proportions. The staff was friendly and helpful, the place was spotlessly clean... And I cannot wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the entire Ahi Poke experience whenever I come. It's calm, clean, relaxed, and friendly. I'm always greeted immediately and the menus are presented in an easy-to-comprehend and easy-to-navigate way as I order.  The service is always excellent and the servers are exceptionally friendly. Often I go and ask questions and they're always more than accommodating and willing to provide thoughts and advice.  The food is always fresh (even though it's in fast-food batch form), clean-tasting and of high quality. I'm never disappointed.  My favorite combo is the tuna luau on lettuce, their soy mirin sauce, ginger, cucumber, crispy onion, and lots of crab (I pay extra!)...and it's worth every cent!"}
{"text":"Great food, small portion for the price."}
{"text":"I love this place!! One of, if not the best place for food. We come here almost everyday for lunch! Phillip is amazing, if you stop in make sure you say what's up to him! The customer service is awesome and such a fun experience."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, awesome new location. You literally can not go wrong with this place. I'm not sure i'll ever eat a sushi roll again, because their poke bowls are that legit."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've tried ahipoki!! I've always meant to try it but never got around to it! The location is spacious and I like the airy layout. I tried salmon, scallop and spicy tuna, and had half white rice, half salad and all the toppings (with avocado) except for wasabi and ginger. I loved the spicy creamy dressing!!!!! Omygosh this dish was life-changing! I love the blend of textures and flavors from my dish--it was simply exquisite. I liked the crispy onions and spicy red pepper flakes and seaweed flakes (not a fan of sesame seeds so I omitted that) mixed together with everything.  I would definitely eat here again and again and I'll recommend this place to all my friends!!! I just love it and the portion for my meal was also more than satisfactory! I think the food was just divine. Service was excellent as well and everyone was so warm and friendly and hospitable, which I think is very important. :)"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. It's absolutely delicious. You can do half rice and half salad which I like to do and then I usually get the spicy tuna and kimchi shrimp with all the toppings. The staff is always friendly and quick. Life does not get any better than Ahipoki Bowl"}
{"text":"The food however is great like always. Usually, I just get a large bowl in with white rice and onions and avocado. Today, I had the large white rice/lettuce with onions 1 serving of tuna, and 2 serving of salmon.  For the sauce, I always get the house spicy and garlic sauce; it's a sweet, vinaigrette (soy sauce like) taste with a hint of garlic and is actually not spicy at all.   When it comes to the sides to add on, I get the crab salad, bean sprout, ginger, seasoned seeds to go on it. And I always top it off with sriracha myself because I'm a sriracha addict (well... actually more of a spice addict).  Overall, the fish was good and seemed fresh. It tastes amazing. I love the different texture from all of the components of the bowl. I'd consider it to be a \"cleaner\" option of food as well. I just wish they could up the amount of fish portion."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! They really load up your bowl to the brim, which is good because it is a little pricey. I always get salmon and shrimp and the house spicy sauce is my favorite! Always have enough leftover for another meal."}
{"text":"This is my go to poke place. The seafood is always great quality and the staff is very efficient. I usually get the salad with some combination of salmon, shrimp and/or tuna and I pretty much get all the toppings offered. The first time I went the guy helping me out recommended half spicy creamy dressing and half house dressing.... definitely a winning combo  I now have my husband hooked on this place too. I'm making myself hungry just writing the review!"}
{"text":"Awesome Poke Salad Experience!   We have been to 2 of their other locations and the Food is great. Super fresh salad and raw fish goodness combined with tasty sauces.   Tasty Thai Tea!  Friendly service and the crew keeps the place nice and tidy even during the rush.  Great spot for a healthy meal!  Parking is tricky though during the busy times...."}
{"text":"House sauce was amazing, try a sample. The bowl was pretty decent overall. Good tasting sushi rice. A bit skimpy with the pickle salad and toppings in general but forgivable. The cucumbers (before I mixed them in) tasted a bit fishy (wth)?. I had the spicy tuna mix, and it was alright. Staff were quiet and indifferent. Glad I gave the place a try and I liked it, but looks like I'll be going back to the place that I regularly go to for poke."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Good food and perfect location by campus. Very clean and modern feel with good music. The staff is super friendly and have recommendations for first timers"}
{"text":"Okayyyyy. I love poke. It's so good. Like.. so good. And my favorite poke place in the valley is Ahipoki Bowl. It's so yum.   The best part is how fresh the ingredients are. And how fresh the fish is. I usually get spicy tuna and scallops, plus white rice, seaweed salad, and some amaaaaaaaazing crispy onions. The spicy creamy sauce is my favorite, but all of them are amazing.   Poke isn't vegan (obvs) but you could make your own bowl without the fish if you wanted. They have great toppings and sides to put on top of your rice or salad. You could easily make a vegan bowl in a pinch.   I like their bigger size, but it's worth noting that the main difference is that you get another scoop of fish, and more rice or salad greens, but the toppings remain the same amount. (For the bigger size I mean.) I have noticed that I get more food (quantity) when I order out through postmates, so I usually do that instead of going in!"}
{"text":"The review was originally left under Scottsdale but it was meant for the Tempe location.  This place is delicious! My first time was about 3 weeks ago, and let me just say I have been returning each week since. The food is very fresh, and have several different ways to mix and match. When I say mix and match I mean different sauces, different veggies, and different proteins. Also the best part is if you're going in during your lunch time expect to be there a few minutes because it is super quick to get your food even faster than fast food restaurants but healthy ;). It is affordable and if you want to add avocado it's only $1 more what a steal and they give a good amount of it! (I'm an avocado lover so for me to have left over is a good thing lol)   I've only gone to the tempe location, but I'm sure it will be the same satisfaction at all locations!"}
{"text":"Yum! This place is a customizable, fresh poke bowl, casual restaurant. It's like Chipotle for Hawaiian food. Pick your protein(s), add your veggies, toppings, and sauce. They also have Thai tea. Prices are reasonable: $24 for two regular bowls and a specialty tea. I would skip the tiny bay scallops next time- they have zero flavor and the texture was chewy. The Ahi was great though!"}
{"text":"Went to the grand opening on Saturday and it was better than I expected. I loved how fresh and tasty the fish was, and really like the interior of the restaurant. I've never had a poke bowl before but it definitely won't be my last. The guy who put the sauces in the bowl was doing a superb job, he was moving so fast but everything was under control, it was pretty amazing to see. Definitely this place is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"We came for dinner and they were out of avocado AND Tuna!!!!! We left! Who has the name ahi...and no ahi to serve.  This location is horrendous."}
{"text":"It was okay I guess I love the place but today wasn't the best I asked for brown rice I get white even though they clarified I said brown twice! Then i don't get a receipt even though I asked fr one it's fine I just wish the staff would listen a little more on what the costumer is asking and saying."}
{"text":"I came in a week ago to order 10 bowls for a busy practice I work with and was stressed to hear that they don't accept phone orders and don't allow you to place more then two bowl orders at a time. Thankfully the office manager overheard the conversation and jumped right in and was able to accommodate my order once the practice sent me the order via text message.  The restaurant did not have anyone in it besides me so they efficiently had the entire order done within 15 minutes. I have to say I was extremely impressed with the office manager's great attitude and attention to detail.  I cannot say enough how impressed I am with this restaurant because of the staff and the food is amazing  my appointment was five minutes up the road and I know this food really made their day I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great but the dining area was filthy. The owners kid was there so I thought it would be spotless but I don't think he really cared. The staff was texting, etc....while the tables were  not clean at all and the floor was just plain gross."}
{"text":"This place does it right, most of the time.  I've gone at least 12 times since they've opened this location and they are very consistent (only had one issue where there was little to no salad/greens in my salad bowl. Super generous on the toppings that day though! And once where the guy was curt and forgot to dress my bf's half/half).  Their toppings are on point (very decent portion of fish) with lots of tasty and fresh veggies, their service is usually fast without being rude or dismissive, and they smile,  even if they look tired.  I think this will stay a fave over the Scottsdale location.  Hands down a great option for a fast, healthy bite by ASU."}
{"text":"Great food! Total different concept than anything Iv had before but I was not disappointed! I had a medium size bowl with salmon, I was recommended this spicy sauce and it fitted the salmon very well. It also fills you up!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get the salmon and it never disappoints. The staff is incredibly friendly. I will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Location is nice if you live or go to school at ASU, otherwise it is a bit of a pain to get to with traffic.   Location itself is super sleek and clean. Big space with plenty of seating to chose from.   However, it goes down hill from there. I got the half greens and half brown rice. They set the greens off separately to mix, which is nice. I got 3 scoops with the large , which was nice, and all the normal options were there (salmon, tuna, spicy tuna, scallops, etc). Next was the sauce, and this is where things went down.   I asked the employee which one he recommended between the two spicy. He said mix both, so I went with it. He added the sauce and mixed them (albeit not well since the fish all ended up on the bottom).   Next were the toppings. I went with a good variety, but the first thing I noticed was how haphazard they threw it in my plate. One of the things I like the most about these bowls is how meticulous they are. Each is a work of art, slowly crafted to satiate. There was a lot behind me, but only a few people, and all I wanted was a few extra seconds to be sure my cucumbers were not strewn about.   I go to check out, and the price was comparable to most other places. They didn't offer me any of the macaroons when I checked out, and I didn't even notice they were there until after.    I sit down to eat, and the sauce was just overpowering everything. The sesame seeds tasted odd, the brown rice was a bit hard, and the overall presentation was not up to snuff. The leftover oil was just too much to bare looking at my empty plate.   The fish, when not drenched in sauce, was of good quality. And honestly that saved this review.   Knowing me, I'll head back again one day, ask for super easy sauce, only greens, and see if it is any better."}
{"text":"Two of my friends and I went here to eat and all three of us got sick a couple hours after eating here. Which made me really sad because I had high hopes for this place. All of us had a variation of a tuna and rice bowl, it was a decent bowl taste and flavor wise. It didnt \"wow\" me or make me want to come back. ( I actually couldn't finish it. ) It's overpriced for what I was given..for sure. Would I eat here ever again? No. Would I recommend it? Absolutely not."}
{"text":"The only thing I found lacking was they open too late for me to go everyday and they used regular white (or brown) rice ... not sticky rice as I have had everywhere else.        (if they would just open 30 to 45 minutes earlier I'd be there everyday I'm in Tempe)   The price is a tiny bit high, but considering all the selections, the freshness and how you can customize the bowl with different sauces, topping etc.  It's just too good to pass up. The even give me extra seaweed salad when I ask for it (I don't do a lot of sides)    It well worth the money!"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that I just love Ahipoki Bowl restaurant in general, this location has exceptionally friendly staff! They really treat you like you are a movie star, haha. Love going there."}
{"text":"Loved the food, but I wish they have a bigger portion. The small bowl is very small and the large bowl is really medium size.  I left the restaurant and still hungry."}
{"text":"Love Ahipoke ever since I tried the one in Scottsdale. Was around Tempe so decided to give this one a try. Everything is delicious, only negative thing I have to say is their hella stingy with the topping. Like they scoop so little that's it's not even worth $.75 extra if you want more. Like I'm paying $13+ for a large bowl. I think Us customers deserve more than a itty. Bitty scoop and sprinkle in our poke bowl. Overall, the staff was friendly than the Scottsdale location. They even asked if my son wanted a size of white rice. I said no thanks, Because I was in a hurry to go home. Still enjoy my poke bowl :)"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of seafood but Ahipoki has great options and has made me a fan. I've been there several times now and have gotten great service every time. I usually go in the dinner timeframe and have never been more than one or two people back in line. A little pricey for fast casual, but they use quality ingredients."}
{"text":"So my best friend spilt his bowl everywhere and the super awesome manager CT gave him a new one without hesitation! So thoughtful of them. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! The fella that made my bowl was super friendly!  I had two salmons, a spicy tuna, and the yellowtail. The yellowtail and salmon scoop sizes seemed pretty par for the course as far as what I have experienced here in PHX. The spicy tuna was a more generous scoop, but bland as sh*t. However, it didn't ruin my bowl. I would recommend avoiding it though.  In my bowl I had. Onion: not overpowering. I enjoyed it. Masago: I enjoyed it. The red pickled radish: I have been to maybe 10 poke places at this point and I have never seen this. I asked what it was, and the friendly gentleman explained what it was. He then mistook my response for approval, and put it in my bowl. Didn't want it initially, but it was really good and I'm happy for the mistake! Scallions: enjoyed/didn't really stand out. Krab: enjoyed it Avocado: paid extra and meh. I'd do it again, but I prefer slices. This was a slight mush. Not mushy, just avocado thrown together in a big dish and scooped out.  Seaweed salad: love it. A little moister (is that a word?) than some places but good. Onion and seaweed flakes: yum! Cucumber: fresh and small slices - yum  Wasabi: less than stellar, seemed a little wetter than most places. Pickled ginger: standard issue/run of the mill - not bad or good.  I've paid less for better bowls, but I've had worse as well. I'd recommend this place, overall I enjoyed it, and the dude that helped me was very friendly.   The place was clean and the decor is modern. I came late so I didn't experience a wait or have any trouble sitting.   Place gets a thumbs up from me and I will be back if I am in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"I got the large with one scout of tuna and 2 of salmon and pretty much all the toppings. They don't skimp on the extras at all! I had so much avocado and seaweed salad in my bowl til the last bite! The creamy spicy sauce was super good, maybe a little too mild for my taste but I also had wasabi to give some heat. The price is definitely worth it and the staff is super nice! The macaron ice cream sandwiches were to die for!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Scottsdale location and today was my first time coming here. The physical layout of this spot is different and I didn't realize where the start of the line was and walked all the way to the end, lol. But it does allow for more of a line to form as opposed to the other location, where it has to loop at the door.  Anywho, being familiar with the food I ordered my usual regular size to-go and grabbed some premium soy sauce and chopsticks, no bag. The employees are nice and it was easy to tell them what I wanted as toppings since the glass isn't as high as the other spot. Though they seemed to skimp a bit on some of them like the sprouts, but maybe I never noticed before how much I got. It ended up being a filling meal when I got home and yummy as always. Good work, Ahipoki Bowl!"}
{"text":"So good but pricey! They charge extra for everything... where elsewhere it's included. Can't complain too much though.. it was hands down the best poke bowl I have ever had!"}
{"text":"It's the Chipotle of poke, but with small portions. The food is decent quality, and there is no healthier or leaner meal than a poke bowl with mixed greens."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday early evening  and the place was empty. As we were new to \"poke\" the staff spent alot of time discussing all the options.  With the exception of the octopus everything was delicious.  The octopus was very bland and chewy. The place was pleasent and clean."}
{"text":"Another experience in a seafood restaurant. Causal place, no noice, a fine decoration.  I had chosen a regular plate, white rice, spicy tuna, Kimchi shrimp, house sauce, and cucumber.  The food was tasty especially when i mixed it with soy sauce. A regular plate is not for you if you are starving. The tuna and shrimp were not too spicy, but it was delicious. Rice was so so, so mix it with sauces!  I give this place 4 stars because of the cost of the food. Pricey but tasty!"}
{"text":"Looks like the Poke Bowl craze has finally hit the mainland.  For da ohana from the islands, you know this stuff would come here eventually.  So of course, I had to try it.  Place is right by work so a lot of college students.  Parking sucks as it took me about 3 rotations around the building before finding something.  I wasn't the only one that had the issue as I watched other cars do the same.  The place is clean and the staff was polite and helpful.  Now to the good stuff.  Like all the other places, they offer rice and/or greens for the base.  I ordered a regular size with brown rice as to stay with the healthy theme.  They filled the bowl about 3/4's full which I thought was a little much.  I like onion with my poke so I agreed to it.  I chose to have 2 scoops of the Ahi and had it mixed with creamy spicy sauce.  I love spicy tuna so that is why I went with that sauce.  They offer spicy tuna but it seemed like it was just smothered in sriracha.  I had my bowl topped with a scoop of crab, edamame, cucumber, seaweed salad, green onion, crispy onion, furikake, and sesame seeds.  Before I dig in, I like to mix up everything so every scoop will have all flavors.  Found that ratio of rice to everything else was out of whack.  I am also sad to say I didn't get the mmmm factor.  For some reason there was not much taste that came from the sauce.  The toppings were fresh and tasty but the sauce and the fish didn't come together.  I mean, I can get by without sauce and just eating fish with the fixings but I didn't get any heat or that mayo/sriracha flavor.    This place is alright but I don't love it.  For the amount of money and the amount of fish that I got, I wasn't unimpressed.  I get charging for the scoop of avocado but extra for imitation crab salad?  Das not cool.  Really, can't give these guys 5 stars.  There is another place that I gave five stars to cause the servings seemed larger, just as good or even better fish, with much more flavor, at a better price, and just a couple miles down the street from here."}
{"text":"Best spot in Tempe to eat, especially if you need something quick and casual. Essentially a chipotle, but for poke bowls. So many options for what you can do. Nutritious, filling, and not too expensive. Love it"}
{"text":"I am giving this establishment 4 stars and the reason to that is because; the food was delicious, the whole concept of the meal is amazing! I come from a small town in Utah and I have never seen any kind of restaurant like this. So I enjoyed it. Sadly what sucked the fun out of my experience was the staff, I understood it was like an hour to closing time but come on people, friendly acceptable attitudes are a plus in a new experiencethe dude who placed the salad and rice in the box was cool but the other two were wack"}
{"text":"Another Ahipoki bowl, this time in Tempe! The tuna and salmon salad I had was good, although I did get a not-so-fresh yellow piece of wilted greens in my salad. The fish was fresh as were the toppings, and the soy mirin sauce went well with everything in my bowl.  Service was fast and friendly and there were plenty of seats to choose from once we had finished paying."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Great place, just like the one on scottsdale road.  If you want a healthy and tasty meal come here.    They are very accommodating,  you can really mix and match many of the options here.   Their ice cream macaroons LOOK GOOD, but they are just okayish.   The poke bowls are the main item here.   Haven't had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I am SO HAPPY an ahipoki opened up right by ASU! just as delicious and fresh as all their other locations. This is the perfect option for my goal to be healthy and stay on top of my college/work schedule. Great service, great food, great neighborhood. What's not to love!"}
{"text":"Have had twice  now and both times was delicious .Fresh food and fast service only downside is the building is a little small for the volume of traffic going through."}
{"text":"I normally hit the one in Scottsdale but was in the area. First of all I'm addicted! I have been to other poke places and Ahipoki is by far the best.   Second, the Tempe location is on fire. Today was my first visit and the staff was super friendly and high energy.   Third, portions! I love the size of the portions. A lot of other places give way smaller portions and they don't fill me up. But here it's the perfect size. It fills me up and gives me fuel! I opt for the greens to make it a low carb meal too and so I never feel too full. And it literally keeps me going for hours since I'm always on the go but need a healthy choice for lunch.   This location is super clean and decor is on point. Love how crisp it feels with the simple colors and geometric patterns."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great but the staff is extremely friendly and helpful! If it is your first time and you're not sure what to get, don't hesitate to ask for their recommendations. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here almost everyday after work or during lunch. This is super healthy and on the go if you need to the staff is awesome highly recommend this spot for any foodies that love poke bowls. The quality of the fish is awesome and fresh. Love the new location"}
{"text":"I was beyond hyped that one of my favorite restaurant concepts of all time APB was opening up a branch in Tempe. I used to drive 15+ minutes to get to the original location in Scottsdale, now my Pokedrive is cut in half!   Do yourself a favor and go for the large half and half. That's half salad half half rice in a larger container. This is served with your choice of 3 scoops of fish rather than the two which comes with the the regular. Ordering a large will allow you to try a few different sushi grade fish offerings in one order. Personally. I roll with  octopus, spicy tuna, and tuna chunks. The fish is served super fresh, I have never had an issue with getting sick or getting stanky stale fish. I trust this spot to keep my raw fish fresh and safe. You can also upgrade to a 4th serving of fish for about $2 more. Recently the spicy tuna has been prepared in a more chunky style. I love this, as previous versions were a bit mushy. This new style has better mouth feel.  Spicy creamy sauce is the best option available. It is reminiscent of a Japanese spicy mayo. Sriracha sits on every table along with regular soy sauce; note that low sodium soy is an inferior ingredient and should be avoided at all costs. APB made the right decision by keeping regular sodium soy as the primary option.   Outstanding upbeat customer service, a clean modern atmosphere (yes there is EDM bumping) and non skimpy portions make this a champion of fast causal fish. You can spend 25-$30 on a sushi dinner (plus tip) or hit this spot for a $12.50 hookup for a filling amount of fish and sushi condiments. The value proposition is very real with consistence that keeps me coming back. Right now I can afford this 2x a week, but maybe, if I follow my dreams I can eat Poke every day."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. 1st time here. Staff was very helpful with walking me through the line and options. Definitely will come back! But....they need to make a location in Gilbert. The drive over to Tempe wasn't the best part."}
{"text":"I love this place. Really convenient location for students. The regular half and half is by far the best for your money. Always really fresh and clean inside. I do the tuna luau and tried the new salmon. (Like a sriracha) It was really good! For sauce the house is the best. It is a bit pricey but fresh fish usually is so not unusual. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome poke bowls. Fresh and delicious veggies rice and fish. Friendly and quick service. They were so nice they let us bring our dog in from the heat outside. Affordable prices. I'm definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"Super stingy on the fish and seaweed salad portions. Employees have clearly been heavily trained to limit portion sizes. Overpriced for what you get compared to other poke places I've been to"}
{"text":"I had never even heard of Poki until recently.  It was everything I expected and more. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Clean and well decorated. Handicap accessible. A couple items you need to pay extra for...yellow tail and avocado, the crab maybe more but that was what we had. The tuna was fresh and very tasty. You can choose white rice or brown rice. I'll go back!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful poke bowl place in Tempe. It's a little bit pricey, but I would recommend getting the smaller bowl over the bigger bowl. They also charge extra for avocado and they don't tell you about that cost."}
{"text":"Employees were pretty nice-- I asked the guy working to give me whatever he recommended and it was amazing. I think it was tuna and salmon tossed in some sauce with spicy mustard on top. Really yummy and super close to my dorm. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars!  Or at least 4 1/2.  The salads are where it's at when you want something fast, affordable, and healthy that you can bring anywhere else like to work."}
{"text":"Got the 2 scoop bowl with tuna and shrimp. I'd say you might get about 2 ounces of tuna and 3 ounces of shrimp - certainly not much. Tuna was great, shrimp was blah. Salad was great, brown rice - so, so. All of the topics make the experience entertaining. Try it."}
{"text":"My favorite ahi poki salad restaurant in the Valley. Multiple locations to choose from and all of the locations have excellent service.  This location tends to get very busy since it is in Tempe and parking is very limited.   My go to is the mixed salad with octopus, salmon or tuna luau. The house spicy is my favorite dressing. And lots of toppings! From Cilantro, green onion, crab salad, cucumbers, sprouts, wasabi, the dried garlic, pepper and seaweed, makes it extra delicious.  Who doesn't love ahi poki?!"}
{"text":"Hesitantly went in for my first time tonight and I'll definitely be back. The place seemed clean on the inside and I love the big windows. Right away I was asked if I needed help and the guy at the counter was really nice. He walked me through everything. I got the veggie bowl with spicy house sauce and all veggie toppings except the seaweed salad. It was way better than I expected it to be! And all the employee were very nice and willing to explain everything to me. The Thai iced tea was good too."}
{"text":"First, both the staff working were very rude and condescending simply because it was my first time and I was unsure of what to say when. They replied with grunts and silence which made the whole ordering process pretty awkward. Bowl itself was pretty good, topping to base ratio was definitely off, it was basically a rice salad with a couple pieces of fish sprinkled on top. Tasted fresh though so that was good!"}
{"text":"This is how much you will get with a large size salad.  Apparantly they consider five tiny cubic of salmon as a scoop.  You will get much more at the Scottsdale location.  Will not come again."}
{"text":"I love love Poki Bowl. There was a small poki place next to my old neighborhood and I was happy to know that this location opened in Tempe. I was impressed for being a chain that their fish tasted very fresh. Everything I ordered from the brown rice to the toppings I added tasted delicious. I will definitely be coming back here since you cant go wrong with a healthy bite."}
{"text":"Not authentic at all.  The tuna had no flavor and so much dressing on the salad it was soggy.  I walked in thinking it would be similar to a poke shop in Hawaii. It is so far from it.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but wow! What a great price for so much food! I was surprised how fresh the fish I was. I wish this was here when I lived in Hassy... I would've been here everyday"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is always fresh and never disappoints me! The Manager is super friendly and Darren is always smiling when I go in there! That guy is awesome"}
{"text":"10/10 would eat here again! I have been looking for a good place to get Poke that's not terribly expensive and this place hit's the spot.   Ordered a large (3 scoop) bowl with Tuna, Salmon, Spicy Tuna and white rice. Sauce was the Garlic Soy Mirin. The sauce wasn't bad, it just wasn't a super powerful/potent flavor. I did get the House Spicy on the side though and that had just enough of a kick for my taste. I think next time, I'll be getting the Sweet Citrus sauce instead though. As for toppings; I went with Avocado, Cucumbers, Green Onions, Edamame, Crab Meat, Sesame Seeds, Crispy Onions, and Chili Flakes. With a drink - total was $15.66. I enjoyed every last bite of my Poke bowl and was sad when it was all gone because it was just THAT good. The restaurant for dine in was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful.   The ONLY negative feedback I have is the fact that prices for the bowls and additional toppings aren't listed on their website. As someone who works in the online business industry, I know how important it is to have this information on your business' website. For me, this was a 30 minute drive from where I live and it would have been nice to know ahead of time what I was looking at price wise. That said; for the quality and quantity of the ingredients - the price was exactly what I expected for such a meal, which isn't terribly expensive."}
{"text":"Who needs burrito bowls when you can have poke bowls? I think I eat enough fish for my body to be recognized as a thermometer. That mercury life!  I wish this place existed back when I was a wee lil Sun Devil at ASU.  I remember back when I was a student, Pizza Hut bread sticks from the Memorial Union was the coolest thing you can get on campus and surrounding dining consisted of either a damn good burger at The Chuckbox or the worst Thai food ever from Charlie's.  You Sun Devils got it SO good these days.  At least parking in Lot 59 was only $75 when I went so suck it.  Now, to start: HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, AHIPOKI!   I'm writing this review for their third restaurant on the first year anniversary of their first location.  Woo!  I frequent the Chandler location the most but I can say that no matter which location you pop into, quality and quantity is consistent.  One big bonus about this ASU location is that they're open later.  Parking can be a little aggravating and the traffic in the area is something straight out of a nightmare but if you want clean eats that's both good and good for you, stop into Ahipoki!    The regular half-and-half is always more than enough for me and you gotta wash it down with the Tropical drink.  It might give you diabetes but it's so good.  One thing that Ahipoki does that the competitors don't do is mix the salad and fish with the sauce. I hate eating my rabbit food without sauce.  So yes, slather it on, Ahipoki! #SauceBauce  I'm a fan for life!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Ahipoki Bowl.  I was lured in by their email announcing that today only, they were offering 50% OFF ALL of their bowls at their Tempe location.  I arrived at about 10:30, and the line was already wrapped around to the back of the building!  I was really glad that I had arrived \"early\".  I managed to find a place to park in their lot, and got in line to wait.  They opened right on time at 11:00.  When I finally actually got inside the door (11:10), it was actually nice to have a good bit of time to make my decisions since there were so many options. Looking ahead, the line was still quite long, but it only took me another 15 minutes to reach the counter.  Service was fast, efficient, helpful and friendly, and the whole experience turned out to be fun.   I got two 3 scoop bowls (large), one with rice and the other with organic salad. I didn't realize how generous the scoops were until I was served!  3 scoops was probably a bit ambitious for me, but I had skipped breakfast and was starving.  I wanted to try everything.  In the rice bowl I ordered scoops of spicy tuna, salmon, and tuna luau (ahi tuna tossed with green onion, avocado, garlic soy mirin sauce, and sesame oil - yum). I had all of the wet toppings except edamame, and had as my dry toppings chili flakes, furikake, and sesame seeds.  My sauce was garlic soy mirin.  Delicious!  Everything was so fresh.  In the salad bowl, I ordered scoops of spicy tuna, tuna luau, and yellowtail (extra $1), all the wet toppings except edamame, chili flakes, furikake, sesame seeds, and kimchi sauce.  This will be my dinner tonight, but I tasted it and it two was fresh and delicious.  I added avocado to each bowl at $1 extra per serving.  The line backed up slightly at the register, but only for a moment.  I was out of there with my food and a Thai iced tea slightly before 11:30.  Since I embraced the idea that at 50% off, this was going to be an adventure that included a line, and some wait time - I had no problem with the time involved.  I loved my food, and hope that this Tempe location remains a 5 star experience.  (I'd heard from several friends that the Scottsdale store went downhill somewhat after a strong start...)  I'll be back to the Tempe store again soon!  At 50% off this was an over the top value!"}
{"text":"Went there an hour before close, had amazing service, never have been before so everything was explained properly in regards to ordering etc, & didn't feel rushed which is a rarity when it comes to my past customer service experience with other establishments & companies. Was hoping the food was as good as the service...& it was! Very satisfied & above my expectations! Also, not to mention the great build out of the building, along with the new/improved/renovated plaza as well. Seems to be filled with other admirable tenants. All in all, a place definitely worth trying out. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've been craving poke since I first tried it in Cali 5 months ago... So glad it's here now in Tempe! Tried a large bowl of salmon with their spicy house sauce today and loved it. My go to for healthy good food"}
{"text":"I love it! I am a big fan of poki bowls & I can tell if it is fresh or not but this one is 5 stars! Even though it's from Arizona, the seafood options they have are fresh and delicious! I do need to advice the staff to smile and not give a \"too serious\" face. They didn't smile very much when I chose to select what I want in my bowl. Lol. But that's fine. I am coming back here again though!"}
{"text":"I am OBSESSED with this place. Their spicy tuna is so amazing, along with the regular ahi tuna. They charge you extra for avocado but it's so worth it because you are given a very generous amount! The sauces are serious perfection too. I can't get enough of their food."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a Tempe location of this gem! I'm still getting used to the whole raw seafood concept but it's growing on me. When I'm feeling adventurous I'll come here.   Came for the store's opening event and enjoyed their 50% off special and free cotton candy :) The line was super long but they were fully staffed in anticipation of the crowds and kept it clean and orderly.   I've been to the Scottsdale location and the ordering process is the same. I like the layout of this location a little more because to me, it feels more open.   I tried their half salad half rice with ahi luah and salmon. Again, eating raw fish still makes me a little uneasy but it tasted fresh and I love the myriad of toppings and sauces.    Parking can be somewhat tricky as there are a few other popular restaurants in this plaza. Which also means there are other dining options if you or anyone in your party aren't thrilled about seafood. If you're a little adventurous, give this place at least one shot."}
{"text":"YOU GUYS MESSED UP THE RICE. HOW CAN YOU MESS UP RICE. This place would have been a easy 5 stars for me because the food is good and the portion is good. BUT NO. The rice is super super hard. The whole grain of the rice is hard. It is either yesterdays rice that you guys served me or somebody clearly does not know how to cook rice. Clearly there was no taste test that was done beforehand. OR SOMEBODY JUST DOES NOT CARE TO REMAKE IT. I definitely learned my lesson and will always sample the rice before I get it! If you're reading this right now: THROW THE RICE AWAY AND MAKE A NEW BATCH!!"}
