{"text":"The staff is super friendly and made sure as soon as we arrived to get an english speaking waitress for us. The prices were very fair considering how much was on each plate. The food came pretty fast and everything was delicious. Would highly recommend this breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Extremely cheap and very delicious. This place is great for people who only speak English. Menu is in both French and English. Very convenient, my meal was huge for only $10.50. Very amazing breakfast place would defiantly recommend. Especially if you're coming on vacation and need a cheap/quick breakfast place this is for sure the place. Extremely busy in the morning, but very quick."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go to for breakfast especially when I'm in the south shore 
It gets busy sometimes, but if you're not in a hurry... Just wait a few minutes to get seated. It's worth it.  I usually come here once a week & I love it !!! Excellent service from the staff and food is delicious. Good portions, Clean place & Good pricing. They're open 7 days a week !! They have a lot of choices on their menu so if you have a big appetite you'll definitely find something you like."}
