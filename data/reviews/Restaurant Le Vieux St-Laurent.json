{"text":"The most classic Main diner style breakfasts and atmosphere. Expect at line if you're there after 10-11am on a Saturday Sunday . Join the hungover students and hipsters as they recount their epic nights over greasy breaky and bottomless coffee. As it should be."}
{"text":"Trekked a long way to get here for brunch as per our concierge's recommendation one Saturday afternoon. We waited about an hour between the time we ordered our food and the time it was placed in front of us. The waitress said that it was always that busy on Saturdays but I felt that we could have been warned as we were extremely famished once we arrived and were literally going stir crazy watching people eating around us.  Despite this major setback our food that arrived was delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the bacon wasn't too fatty and it came with a small cup of fruit and unlimited coffee which we really needed. The homefries were my favorite part and I would go back just for those.  Overall, I am pleased with the food but felt that the service should have informed us of the long wait ahead so we could plan accordingly."}
{"text":"The food was cheap and delicious. The breakfast poutine is a must-try! Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We will be going back there very soon (maybe tomorrow)"}
{"text":"L'endroit est plutôt simple et vieillot mais les déjeuners et le service étaient excellents!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Food. Poor Service.  The eggs are meh, the pancakes taste synthetic, the fruit is rarely fresh, the beans are mushy, and the potatoes are lackluster to say the least. The condiments containers are also often filthy, with the bottles either greasy or covered in caked-on content.s  The only reason I eat here is because it is around the corner from my house. If you're on the Plateau looking for a place to brunch, there are several other places you should consider first -- e.g. Bagels Etc., L'Evidence, Universel, and the list goes on.  They're also prone to messing up orders, whether eating-in or getting take-out.  In a word, not really worth a stop-in unless you're literally around the corner and too hungover/tired to go any further."}
{"text":"De passage prolonge a Montreal, et domicilie a l'hotel proche de YUL, je cherchais du couscous. Je suis tombe sur ce restaurant a Saint-Laurent, dans un quartier tres ethnique ou on trouve des restos de beaucoup de nationalites, surtout moyen-orient et Afrique. Une devanture discrète et un local tout en profondeur - le decor a vu des meilleurs jours - certainement beaucoup de jours. Attention, ce n'est pas un endroit chic! Mais le diner etait impeccable! J'etais seul, donc je ne peux juger que de 2 plats: la soupe harira et le couscous. La harira etait bien parfumee, avec du boeuf, lentilles et pois chiches - tres bonne. Quant au couscous merguez pour moins de $10, il etait préparé par le chef au comptoir et porte a table dans une assiette profonde avec tout ce qu'il faut - voir la photo. Du bouillon et harissa a cote. Tout cela et le thé a la menthe pour moins de $15 TTC! Une bonne adresse."}
{"text":"Perfect place for greasy spoon family-style breakfast and brunch. Tons of food for good price. Friendly service.  Had the waffle special which included the eggs. Good taste of most things on the menu, if you want to sample multiple things.   Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict was very tasty! Big portions and Annie split the portion into two plates for us! 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Classic diner with lots of breakfast choices. We had 3 different bennys and an omelette, and all were tasty, with very large portions. Didn't have to eat again til dinner.  Prices seem steep, but most dishes include coffee, which brings it back to reasonable. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"There are so many options on this menu; it would take forever to try every single item on it. I don't understand how they provide so much selection. Buttermilk pancakes? Baked beans? Omelette? French toast? Eggs benedict? Would you like the Festin number 1 which is unlimited coffee refills, two eggs, two pancakes, three slices of bacon, ham, sausage, baked beans, breakfast potatoes, toast and meat pate? I got it and I was so full I had to take the pancakes home with me. I was full for the whole day and the meal was only $13?!! It's a great deal for the amount of food you get. Not super fancy, but a great casual restaurant to go to after a late night out or a brunch treat for one's self. I probably won't come again since i like to try different brunch places but for it's price point it's a great brunch place to go to."}
{"text":"Best diner dive brunch experience. The food is simple but delicious, well prepared and the quantities are big. Amazing price value. This place is extremely underrated."}
{"text":"Wish we hadn't waited until our last day in Montreal.  I'm partial to breakfast but it's still one of the best meals I had during our trip.  Excellent service...great bottomless coffee and delicious food.  Will definitely be back when in town."}
{"text":"Nice spot with friendly and attentive service! Great breakfast selections and you cant go wrong with any of the crepes."}
{"text":"Want breakfast? That's what you'll get.  Classic petite dejeuner for under $5 with lots of other breakfast options on the menu.  No frills, no jam (you have to ask and even then they dole the stuff out like gold, one packet at a time), lots of refills on your coffee. They serve late, are quick about it, will probably tease you about your French and bring you a hot simple plate of exactly what you expected.  The potatoes are quite tasty. Like fries but in the shape of breakfast potatoes.  Breakfast served until 4pm, Interac and credit cards accepted, you can easily get out of Le Vieux St-Laurent for two under $15."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here & it was amazing. The place was buzzing with a nice lively crowd. We got our food on time even though there were 5 people.  Everything was fresh & tasted great.  Server knowledge: 4 Server attitude: 4.5 Fast service: 4 Food Menu: 4 Drinks Menu: 4 Food quality: 4 Food Portion: 4.5 Ambience: 3.5 Distance to other tables: 4 Cleanliness: 4 Comfort: 4 Waiting time to get seated: 4.5 Price: 4"}
{"text":"Came here starving after a long night, as it was close by - you know you'll get your money's worth when all you see is hungry, hungover students.   Large varied menu, good portions and cheap! Ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce @ $10 from the lunch menu. Expected it to be mediocre Americanised bolognese & heavy on the tomatoes, but it was delicious. I almost finished the whole giant plate.   Interior is your typical aged-looking diner, with no frills, but the food is great and hits the spot."}
{"text":"Came here with a local friend who swears this is her favourite spot for breakfast. I'm a sucker for well-worn diners, and that is exactly what we found here.   Luckily, we were early enough to grab a table - this is a very popular spot, and the crowd at the entrance was thick at the entrance when we left.   Food is diner food, and that's perfect for a weekend morning. I had the smoked salmon omelette and I really enjoyed it. Large portions, bottomless coffee and typically neutral service (they just need to keep pushing the customers through) were expected and received.    For the portions and the \"greasy spoon\" atmosphere, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Quite possibly the best pancakes I've ever tasted (and I am a pancake snob to the enth degree.) The couple that runs this place is awesome and always very accommodating. Def our fav. spot to go when we are in MTL."}
{"text":"Avoid the crèpe! I ordered a spinach and cheese crèpe, couldn't go past 2 bites of it. The thing was soaked in oil, so much so I'm pretty sure I ate 2 spoonful of oil in those two bites."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch spot! Great hangover brunch, very friendly staff and quick service. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great greasy breakfast. Get one of the \"festins\" and you'll be full for the rest of the day. Even though the place is usually very busy, the staff is friendly. Always hits the spot."}
{"text":"We woke up late but still wanted to breakfast.  Not knowing what our options where in terms of \"Denny's\" and \"IHOPs\" in Canada, we decided to check this place out.  They serve breakfast until 4pm.   Great place, great options, and we were able to get our pancakes and toast in the afternoon!"}
{"text":"I had the most delicious chocolate chip and banana pancakes here. We stumbled upon it while walking St. Laurent and I am so happy. It is much like a diner, not fancy but the food is very good."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch food - poached eggs with fruit yogurt and a delicious Montreal bagel, an omelette with home fries toast - plus no wait on an early Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"A classic brunch diner type place. Decor is super old school, and it was super busy when I went, so atmosphere was bumping! Seating a bit crowded but it's a cozy, no frills place.  Menu is expansive, the usual pancakes, eggs Benedict, French toast, omelette type of deal. They give you huge portions! Food is made exactly the way you'd expect it to be. We got the bagel lox platter and the bacon avocado eggs Benedict. The poached eggs and hollandaise sauce was PERFECT.    Best hollandaise I've had by far.  Service is speedy. They also refill your coffee continuously Prices are competitive, you get a lot of food for the price you pay. Would come back!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and friendly service. Their eggs Benedict's done excellent and waffles finger liking good. We will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Quelle belle surprise.... Un dimanche après-midi, nous cherchions une place pour un brunch très tardif, qui ne soit pas fermé, ou plein á craquer ou même que l'on ne nous claque pas la porte au nez.... Une petite recherche sur \"Yelp\" et nous voilà au \"Vieux Saint-Laurent\". Vieux, c'est sûr, la salle á manger ne donne pas trop envie, la Deco est très, très sobre, un air de cafétéria... La serveuse, peu avenante, nous passons commande... Et là, des assiettes pleines, mais vraiment très pleines ! Une serveuse décoincée et une ambiance plus chaleureuse. Un très, très bon qualité / prix... Très bon, bien garnis ! J'y retournerai, c'est certain !"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place for breakfast, and boy were they right! I decided to have the traditional Eggs Benedict, and they were delectable! Of course, the eggs were cooked perfectly...not under-cooked or overcooked. The Hollandaise sauce was very rich, and they give you a generous amount of sauce as well. The potatoes that were served with the meal were also great, not to heavy, but very light. And, of course, it comes with the traditional fruit arrangement that seems to be popular in Montreal. This meal was the perfect size...it was filling but didn't bog you down. Easily, one of the best breakfasts I have had in Montreal, or even anywhere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's an old diner, with a large menu and big portions. This place was here for ages, on the saint-laurent street. I go there from time to time with my friends for a brunch; my favorite is the festin #2, it comes with eggs, bacon, sausages and a buttermilk chocolate chips pancake."}
{"text":"Ouvert depuis des lustres, ce petit deli me rappelle mon adolescence, dejeuner toute la jounee, toute la semaine. Tout est bon, du steak au burger en passant par la soupe du jour maison et des frites croustillantes. Pas tres cher et tres bon service."}
{"text":"Good service and hearty portions. They know how to fit a lot of people into their restaurant. We enjoyed the omelettes we ordered plus we got a side of challah French toast. It is reasonable in cost and they had tons of choices from waffles to pancakes. The home fries are excellent."}
{"text":"Adorable little place with an extensive breakfast and lunch menu! I ordered the Greek Benedict which was quite delicious! As strange as this sounds, the spinach was really what made it! Got my meal a few minutes after everyone else's which always makes me feel a bit awkward. The four of us enjoyed our experience and agreed that we would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Love this breakfast place. Old fashion charm with huge portions. We need places like this in the GTA."}
{"text":"Une très bonne adresse à connaitre, de celles qui ne paient pas de mine mais qui valent le coup.  J'y ai pris un déjeuner avec 1 oeuf, du bacon, des roties, des pommes de terre rissolées et des fruits (café à volonté et confiture/beurre d'arachides sur la table). Le tout pour 7$50 (taxes incluses). Que demander de plus ?  Une bonne adresse pour déjeuner simplement et efficacement !"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I loved it! The food was very good and very well presented. They had various options so everyone I was with had no problem choosing a meal. I rated this four stars because we decided to combine checks and our waitress charged us more. I think she just made a mistake because she was pretty busy! But other than that, I would recommend this place for food! It was very great"}
{"text":"This place has a nice, unassuming feel. It's a cozy diner without any frills. For $6, you can get an egg, sausage, hash browns, that usual choice of \"bread,\" and coffee.   The food is cheap but good (don't get anything with spinach: I'm looking at you, eggs Benedict), and the best part is that there's never a line. Ever. It's so vexing going to brunch and waiting in line for half an hour or going to a place and deciding it's not worth waiting and then finding another place to go. Not here: they actually put tables in their restaurant instead of couches and bean bags and decorative body dancers.   It's not something to show off (unless you're showing it off to someone who asked to go to a diner), but it's convenient."}
{"text":"This place has everything. We came for breakfast and there was something for every taste. The Lunch-Dinner menu was also extensive. Glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Do you want to eat a fancy meal, where you like boasting you scored seats? Well this ain't it!  This has been a Main staple for so long and yet maintained its goal, to fill you up!  The Omelette was excellent, the amount of fruit served is unbelievable (given how rising commodity prices has decreased portions elsewhere)  What you see is what you get, an amazing breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have a weird interest in the north american family dining experience. The utilitarianism of the wipe-down surfaces and stainless steel kitchens, the bustling staff who fill up your coffee just like they do in diners in the movies, and most of all, the menu: that 200-page laminated, illustrated novel that contains, without fail, every combination of food known to man.   Chicken wings? Yeah! Eggs Benedict? Of course! Pizza, tacos, burgers, pie? We have them all!  This place is one of those, and though I like to tell myself I come here just for quick and easy fuel, the truth is that I love the experience and the food is always good. Do I wish the beans were a bit more generously portioned? Yes. I love beans. But do they make up for it by piling your plate high with every other breakfast food known to man? YOU BET.   The staff here are so lovely, too - or perhaps it's just the one lady I've had on three occasions who, I'll be honest, I'm a little bit in love with. Not only was she kind and receptive, she even recommended the sharing plate - which is basically two breakfasts for the price of 1.2 breakfasts. WHAT!  This place isn't going to blow you away with fine dining, but it will take care of that tum rumble in ten thousand lovingly-made ways, and that's just what you need sometimes."}
{"text":"Pretty much the most average place on The Main, but that plays to its charm. It's got eggs, it's got bacon and in the afternoon, it has sandwiches and some other stuff.   You get what you pay for, and always leave with a full stomach.   Fun fact: This is my first time back in two years, and NONE of the staff have changed. Good sign that they're treated well."}
{"text":"Waitress is friendly and attentive, coffee (and refills) are free, and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I am all about dive diners but my breakfast was nasty. The tomaotes in my omelet tasted sour, like they had gone bad. I barely ate any of it and just paid and left. Also overpriced for the quality of what you get. Won't be going again."}
{"text":"Client depuis des années, dîner genre années '70/'80, prix très abordables pour les petits déjeuners, assiettes généreuses, service ok. Ils ouvrent à 6h30am. J'adore le Festin #1. (2 oeufs / 2 pancakes / bacon / saucisse /patates / fèves aux lard) 11,50$. Allez y le matin de bonne heure avant le rush des lève-tards."}
{"text":"Très bonne nourriture et en très grande quantité dans l'assiette. Le rapport qualité/prix est vraiment à son avantage."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my friend after looking at some other Yelp reviews.  Breakfast was Cheap. Food was hearty. Service was good. (loved the potato slices on the side) Food was good.  Only thing I'd change.... the option of how you want your eggs made for an eggs benedict.   4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Another great place to eat in Montreal!  A wide variety of options on the breakfast front (seeing that I was there between the breakfast and lunch hours) and if I am not mistaken, breakfast is served for most of the day, if not all day.  The egg dishes and omelettes come with white or wheat toast, breakfast potatoes, a small fruit cup, and coffee, if you so choose.  I had a basic cheddar omelette with wheat toast and probably the best potatoes ever (not greasy at all!)  They also offer a nice selection of pancakes, crepes, french toast, and any other breakfast dish you could possibly think of.  Friendly waitstaff, excellent food, and great service make it all the more enjoyable.  Plus, the restaurant is so conveniently located in the trendy St. Laurent area along with many other cool shops."}
