{"text":"Love this place, especially the Prince of Thais wrap, and the pasta salad. The only thing that annoys me are the hours. I wish they were open just a bit longer in the evenings.    But that is really the only negative thing I have to say."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but there is no parking and the lunch wait is looong. its also pretty healthy eats which is not too exciting"}
{"text":"Pretty healthy, very tasty, reasonably priced, fun ambiance.  Also, can substitute tofu in any wrap that normally contains meat.  AND- their tofu is SOOOO good.  Huge kudos for that.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 wraps the gringo and the buffalo. They were both delicious but the buffalo had too much ranch. I would suggest place to anyone who like healthy, tasty food."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, this is probably the best place to go in all of Phoenix! It's nice because you can take meat-eaters there too. They do meat and tofu, and it's delicious either way! I got the thai wrap last time and it was wonderful! But everything on the menu is great, plus the fresh fruit side is yummy and healthy. The new location is really cute, you can sit outside on the funky patio and have a wonderful time! Plus, parking is way better than it was at the first location. Way better."}
{"text":"Has to be my *favorite* downtown lunch spot.    The food is fresh and tasty.  And the menu offers quite a bit of variety for a wrap shop.  They have some fairly straightforward wraps, and some that are quite interesting (Very Brady Clubster, anyone?).    I always look forward to seeing the weekly specials.  Sometimes they do not sound intriguing in any way.  Other times they are the best thing on the menu.  I wish a couple of them would turn into regular menu items, but oh well.  As for sides, I haven't gone wrong yet.  Their soups are always good.  The chips and salsa are quite tasty as well.  But the Pièce de résistance is the pasta salad (in my humble opinion, of course).  It's so simple, so tasty and just a bit unique.    And the service, while sometimes slow is always friendly.  They work HARD there and do quite a bit of business.   The girl up front with the pineapple tattoo on the back of her arm - she's a sweetheart and always in a good mood despite how busy they are.    My *only* complaint is the parking, which is minimal.  If you can, go early (11:30 or earlier if possible) for lunch so you can be sure to get a spot and not have to wait too long.  There have been a few times where I've driven through and couldn't get a spot and had to either go someplace else or be creative in my parking.  And when it's 110 out, I'm not so fond of parking a street or two over and walking.  Call me lazy.    On a personal note, I'm trying to make my way through the entire menu, and so far my favorite wrap: Turk-182.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed that one.  (To be fair, I haven't had anything I didn't enjoy at least somewhat.  Most have been spectacular, some have been just OK.)"}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick bite  To be frank, I'm not impressed. After reading all the rave review here and trying it out myself. I don't feel the freshness or better quality ingredients in anyway. The taste is so so, acceptable and bland. I have to spice it up with the tobacco on the table.   Parking is good, decor is hip, people there look cool. Alternative drinks is packed in the cooler. There is a lot to like about the place, but not the food."}
{"text":"The homemade salsa was delicious, and the strawberry-watermelon agua fresca! I ordered the veggie wrap and could tell that the ingredients were fresh but the seasoning just wasn't there. Luckily I had the salsa to put on the wrap and I grabbed the Sriracha from the back table. I love everything about the idea and the execution of the place, so I'll be back to try another item."}
{"text":"Normally pithy nicknames and a vegetarian friendly mission statement scares this carniverous reviewer off.   Usually the wit bespeaks hippy cliche and the veggy-weirdo friendly menu ensures I'll struggle to find anything that once moo'd and if I do, it will taste like processed rubber.  Not so at \"That's a Wrap.\"  My wife describes this adorable wrap shop as being one which makes both her inner slut and inner fat girl happy.  It allowed her to eat good food until she was full without feeling guilty about ruining her diet.   She enjoyed the my sherry amore.  I enjoyed the Rocky VII, basically a cheesesteak wrap.  Both were excellent.  The pasta salad was pedestrian but decent and the fresh fruit salad was spectacularly fresh.     Very reasonably priced and an aesthetically pleasing interior.   Parking is a bitch though a serious problem if you go during a busy time like the lunch hour.  Have someone who can parralel park do the driving."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL PLACE FOR LUNCH!  I love going to lunch at That's A Wrap, the food is amazing fresh and full of flavor, the staff is always nice and helpful with smiles on thier faces. they feature a different VEGAN soup everyday too. The parking can be tight but its not to  bad if you have some patience. yummm yummm yummmmm!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. Does parking suck? Yes. Do they get busy at LUNCH hour? Duh. Is it small? Yes. Is it fun, locally owned with fresh ingredients and nice people that run the place? Yes, Yes, Yes and Yes.   So to me, it's worth 5 stars and $7.82 for a wrap and side....   I see complaints that ppl think it's expensive, me thinks not. If you go to any other lunch time \"quick bite\" place you'll pay about the same amount (or more), unless you're talking about a franchise fast food spot.   This place is right around the corner from where I work so I like to zip over here when I've forgot lunch or too lazy to make it. I almost always get the Turk 182 b/c I love artichokes and the Muenster cheese. I decided to branch out and tried the Sherry A'More. YUM! I don't think the food is bland, and I like flavor. I don't think they all taste the same either....the garlic rice in some of the wraps is great, and I normally don't like rice in wraps.   Every time I go here the people are ALWAYS nice, even when getting eye rolls, sighs and rude comments from customers. Service is HUGE with me and goes a LONG LONG way so I can easily look past small inconveniences of parking and a small restaurant and the occasional mistake of the order taker..."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood gem! Love the food, patio and the friendly service! Great specials, too! Been there twice and loved it so much it promoted me to leave my 1st yelp review!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp & decided to give it a try even though its kind of far from work. My first visit I had the gringo wrap, chips & salsa, and a strawberry-watermelon agua fresca. Everything was great, especially the agua fresca! It did take a while for our food to come out which is understandable since it was lunchtime.  The second time I was smarter, I called in my order for pickup. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and had the pasta salad..again both really good!...dat pastaaa...   Only complaint is that both times my chicken was a bit dry..my friend also noticed that as well. That though will not keep me from coming back. I'm looking forward to trying the thai wrap & other items on menu. I wish they had a place like this in Mesa!"}
{"text":"The outside of this place does not look like much and kind off put me off, but once i got inside it was a very cute and hip place to my surprise.    I got a gyro and it was delicious with tomatoes, Tahiti sauce, lettuce and the shwarma chicken.  I compared this to other sandwich places and it is really worth your time to stop in.  I like that they also have weekly special wraps, which I got today, and was really good.  I also liked that everything was half off so instead of a 8.75 dinner it was a 4.65 dinner,  along with alcohol prices.  Definitely  good for lunch and dinner, not so much for breakfast.  They have outside seating as well, but it was much more enjoyable inside  Recommendation:  sandwich lovers should stop by that a wrap, and stay for the intimate atmosphere and satisfying meal."}
{"text":"We've been going to That's a Wrap for years, but not often enough since they moved locations. They are very vegetarian friendly which is great!! They have a few specialty veg wraps but I love that you can sub tofu for meat on any of them."}
{"text":"Hipsters unite. Good salsa! Average wraps."}
{"text":"wrapss are yummmmmmmyyyyy. i had the Godfather!  the cashier was kinda crazyyy..  music is nice."}
{"text":"Updated 4/7/14  After the owner made it a point to reach out to me and address some of the concerns I mentioned in my previous post, I was willing to give That's A Wrap another shot a few months later. I've been back three times (!!!) in the past month and I'm happy to report that I experienced none of the problems mentioned earlier. My husband and I have ordered to-go twice and both times our meals were flavorful, fresh, and super tasty, and the orders were accurate. Brought my sister back here for lunch on their patio (yay, spring in Phoenix!) and she loved it. She also ordered a cocktail and a cookie and said they were great. I'm really pleasantly surprised and will continue to frequent in the future. Thanks, guys! Good job.    ________________________________________    I want to love you, That's a Wrap. I really, really do.   Healthy, veggie friendly menu at a decent price? Check. Convenient downtown location? Check. The best southwestern-style pumpkin soup I've ever had? Check. $4 Jameson and gingers? Check. Cute, shady, dog-friendly patio? YOU HAVE MY ATTENTION.   But here's where you lost it:  I know lots of places now use call-center type services to handle their take-out orders. Like PF Chang's. Big, chain-type restaurants with a set menu might need that. You do not. Especially when there is a consistent lack of communication regarding your soups/rotating selection of menu items.   Consistently screwing up my order. Like. Every. Time. I shouldn't have to pick up lunch only to get home, deconstruct my order to remove mystery ingredients, get frustrated, and make an entirely new wrap. Avoiding that is kinda why I pay you seven bucks to do it in the first place.  Decreasing food quality. I've been pulling myself back here every few months for the last several years, and I've seen employees come and go, the menu change drastically, etc. But this past visit may truly have to be my last. Giving me a totally unrecognizable wrap from the one that I ordered, with a single, finger-nail sized piece of browned avocado, lettuce that literally SMELLED, dressing/tomatoes/onions that I didn't order, and super stale chips. Not only was it wrong, it was no longer fresh. Some places can get away with serving stale tortilla chips. Whatever. Bad fresh produce, though? When thats the basis of your establishment's menu? NO. No."}
{"text":"Great variety of wraps...chicken wraps, tuna wraps, wrapped wraps...seriously, this is a good lunch joint, often way too busy to get in and out quick. Everytime my wrap and chips is $7.85. It's by far the best $7.85 wrap I've had in Phoenix.  If you need a suggestion, get the messy Buffalo66!"}
{"text":"This is a cool, little urban place on Camelback. Parking can be pain, but the food is tasty.  I've only been here twice now and each time I've ordered the tereyaki chicken bowl which is delish. However, it's really overpriced. $10 for that? The bowl is so big that I barely even eat half of it - and it comes with a side. I wish they would have two different size options, that would solve the problem of it being too expensive and too much food.  Their wraps look good, so I'll be back to try those. But this won't be one of my regular lunch spots. Fun once in awhile though."}
{"text":"Before eating at \"That's a Wrap\" for the first time, I remember reading a few reviews that mentioned how filling the wraps were. I thought to myself, \"Ok, but that's probably for someone with a relatively small appetite.\" Because, you see, I usually eat \"American\" proportions, so I ordered the Thai wrap with the Lentil Soup.  It's not that I was eating incredibly fast, but I didn't realize how freaking full I was until about 30 minutes after I was finished with lunch. I was actually uncomfortable from being so full. I would like to emphasize again that this really doesn't happen very often for me. The food was good, nothing crazy-awesome, but good. I just wish I would have eaten A LOT less of it. That wrap could have easily fed two people. If I go again, I'll be splitting the wrap!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for a wrap, but the people are friendly, atmosphere is cool and relaxed, and the ingredients are high quality. One of my favorites."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on a whim while in the area... The Thai wrap was super yummy, the Turk was okay. I suggest the fruit vs the pasta side. Definitely don't forget the fresh watermelon strawberry agua fresca - it's delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really happy about the new location and the expanded hours. The patio is a plus. The quality, tastiness, and friendly service is still the same. I love that they will substitute grilled tofu for any meat. I also love the sides.  That's a Wrap is nothing insanely original or delicious. It's just really good and consistent."}
{"text":"Its refreshing to find one-of-a-kind places -- God knows Phoenix needs more of them to inject personality into this generic, strip-mall, chains-on-every-corner valley. Finding this unique sandwich shop, which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant, is indeed a welcome find. The real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building.  The dining area is mainly indoors, but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot, which is not very scenic. Inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased.  They serve wraps, bowls and salads. The food has been pretty good, although it did not knock my socks off. I ordered the Baja Bowl, which is described on their online menu as \"Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice, black beans, Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo.\" It was OK, but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks. It could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure, but there were no southwest flavors to speak of. I have done a better job of cooking chicken on my George Foreman grill at home. Perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor, but I had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor. Sour cream was not \"lime\". There was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl. I would not bother ordering this again -- especially if I have a craving for some southwest food.  On another recent visit I ordered a wrap called \"Prince of Thai's - Spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach, garlic rice, fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla.\" That had better flavor than the baja bowl. Vegetable ingredients were fresh and good. Again, I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks.  One thing I think That's A Wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups. Afterall their slogan is \"Healthy Food for a Hungry Planet\" and they have a link for a new restaurant \"Green\" for Vegan food on their website. For such an artsy, earthy place, I would have thought That's A Wrap would have made more conscious, earth-friendly choices. For that reason and the bland chicken, I give them an average rating only."}
{"text":"Needed to pick something up on my lunch hour at Walgreens on Camelback and this place's cute little sign out front caught my attention. I was a little confused on where their building was, but if you're thinking \"That can't be it, that place looks like a small house\" then you're in the right spot. Best hipster interior with a cool front patio and outside patio too complete with grafitti.  That's A Wrap has a little bakery case with a few cupcakes and cookies but it's main dish (hence the name) are wraps and bowls and salads. The casier girl is a peach and was very helpful and even threw her arms in the air when I told her it was my first time visiting. I order the Buffalo 66 without carrots and a fruit salad. Of course I went right at noon and the place was popping. Took a little while to get my food but the bringer outter of food was very polite and assured all the other crazy take outters our food was on its way.  They had cuccumber water, old fashioned Coke bottles, a decent alcohol variety and soda too. Diners were served wraps in what looked like a roofing gutters cut off but it was a little rectangular tin, perfect size for the wraps. I loved it!  I am eating the wrap now and my only complaint is that the fruit salad was a tad small and the chicken is shredded instad of chuncked which you often see in buffalo chicken wraps. Nonetheless, I'm loving the crap out of it and I cannot wait to finish the second half. I will be going back to this place."}
{"text":"I loved this place when I was pregnant.  Now, not so much.  It just tastes very bland.  It reminds me of chipotle. I like Chipotle better unfortunatly.   Must have been the pregnant hormones!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent from the start to finish! Our first time today and we were all very pleased. Amazing staff / service, wraps, watermelon drink, cucumber water, and then the carrot cake. It was all good!!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am a really big fan of the food here. It is reasonably priced and nice size wraps and bowls. It is small but quaint. I am a big fan...The ugly orange monument sign outside should go though.."}
{"text":"I LOVE That's a Wrap. Not only is the food always good, the staff is super friendly and always make good recommendations if you don't know what to try. My favorite dish is the buffalo chicken wrap and the black bean soup, but I have not had anything I don't like!"}
{"text":"My type of place.  This is a great little sandwich shop that I finally got a chance to try a few weeks ago.   Yum! is all I can say....  I loved the Seven Amigos- Peppers, Onions, Black Beans, Corn, Guacamole, Pico de Gallo, Lettuce, Garlic Rice, cheese, Jalapeno Tortilla.  My Fiance had Buffalo 66 Chicken, Medium Wing Sauce, Lettuce, Tomato, Carrots, Celery, House Ranch Dressing, Herb Tortilla.  For a small place the price is a little on the high side but worth the price because of the taste. I love the many selections of Tea and ability to mix and match for the drinks. You must try it at least once."}
{"text":"This place is really yummy I had their special I was a little hesitant at first to try it and because the waitress suggested it I went for it and it was delish.  It was nice, light and tasty!  I would recommend to try this place!  :)"}
{"text":"Love the food but only two starts because the employees are so high especially in the evening that the service sucks.... Having said that, if you have the muchies this prob the spot for you.  Update, the problem I had previously mentioned seems to be fixed and now they seem to get my order right every time and quickly"}
{"text":"I always struggled to understand this place.  I really like the idea of a wrap---and a veggie friendly wrap is even better.  But, there were some real roadblocks that left me confused.  Tonight, I finally figured out the trick to That's a Wrap.   First my problem: I like wraps for lunch.  But, it seems to me that many (if not all?) the wraps are pretty heavy.  Flavor wise, they were awesome.  But so much food---filled with rice---that they put me to sleep. The wraps would work for dinner.  But, somehow, I am never up for a wrap come dinner time.   The trick: Dump the wrap and get the bowl.  Solves the dinner problem!  (And, yes, the flavors are awesome.)  Now, the whole lunch/heavy wrap issue still remains.  Please please develop light wraps! I'll then be there everyday.   One minor complaint on the bowl: The eggplant was sort of rubbery."}
{"text":"A lot of my friends really like this place, and I have no complaints about the atmosphere or the service.  I also appreciate the idea that any wrap can be made vegetarian, so it would be a good place to go with meat-eaters and vegetarians.  But in my experience, the tofu they put in vegetarian wraps usually tastes burnt and gross.  Is that just me?  It used to happen pretty infrequently, but the last several times I've gone there, the tofu has tasted so burnt and bitter I haven't wanted to eat the whole wrap.  The menu has lots on it that sounds really tasty, and vegetarian-friendly restaurants are extremely hard to come by, but in my experience, I just haven't enjoyed the food here."}
{"text":"Love it Love it Love it! Delicious food but always busy and hard to park! Also their hours kinda suck, so if you aren't in the area during the weekdays sorry!"}
{"text":"Part of me is pissed that because places like That's A Wrap are located nowhere near where I work and because they close up shop by dinner time, I have almost no chance of ever eating there. Unless I say \"screw it\" and drive 20 minutes out of my way during lunch, which is exactly what I did today.   So first off, word to the wise - none of my fellow reviewers were kidding: the parking situation here during lunchtime SUCKS. Given that 7th Street is a busy thoroughfare, you can find yourself blocking traffic as the number of cars waiting for a spot keeps growing and growing and spilling onto the right lane of 7th. I eventually gave up and parked on adjacent Palm Lane instead and walked over.  Inside was boisterous: downtown lunch crowd with every table occupied and several other folks hovering over the tables waiting to jump at any sign of an open seat.  It's kind of funny that this place, given its funky and crunchy ambiance, is located so close to downtown Phoenix and packed with suits, when I would have pegged it as some joint you'd find on 4th Ave in Tucson full of college kids. There are salads and rice bowls offered, as well as smoothies like Bluenanarama and Marion Berry, but the big star on the menu, naturally, is the selection of wraps: 16, in fact, plus one daily special on the chalkboard. Some other wraps that Stevey hasn't mentioned in his review include the Gringo Star, The Veggie Jackson, The Prince of Thai's, and the Cheech & Dijon Chicken. Can't fault them for trying to be creative. Each wrap goes for $6.95 a pop, plus a side of pasta or fruit salad or chips & salsa. Kind of steep for a wrap, probably, but the quality of the ingredients is fresh and they don't OD with useless unhealthy stuff if they don't need to.   I myself chose the Ken & Barbie-Que Chicken wrap, and got it to go since I didn't think any table was going to clear up soon. The wait was fairly long, though, about 20-25 minutes, and in that time I glanced about signs thanking patrons for coming to independent businesses like this one (That's A Wrap is part of Phoenix's Chain Reaction coalition). Once I got my order and had a chance to eat it, I was pretty well satisfied, because hot damn - this was one pretty damn tasty wrap! So right on, I'd say.  I'll definitely be back - just probably not during weekday lunch hour, though.  I'd say anytime after 1 (they're open til 5 on weekdays) or on a Saturday (10:30 - 3:00) is a safer bet if you want to check it out. If you do go on weekday lunchtime, go with at most one other person to give yourselves a good shot of getting a table. Or call your order in and get it to go.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Super cute spot for a leisurely lunch - great menu choices and a really cool vibe. I didn't try an actual wrap as the brown rice bowl was calling out to me that day. But that's okay because I know I'll be back....I have my eye on that Thai wrap! But my first trip to this place was pleasant and my Bangkok bowl was dee-lish! I don't think I've ever enjoyed eating vegetables so much in my life. Something I should probably learn to do more often. But I digress...bottom line is that this place is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu tastes the same. Seriously, I think if they blinfolded me and lined up every dish on the menu in front of me I would have no idea which is which. But I guess that's okay because it all tastes pretty good.  Also - they have chipolte tabasco sauce and a nice variety of iced teas.  I like it."}
{"text":"Hooray!  Now that's summer and I'm not working, I can explore places in my neighborhood that are only open during the day.  That's A Wrap is great.  I had the Veggie Jackson wrap, which sounded really weird (eggplant and rice, really?) but was delicious.  I had it with a side of pasta salad which was also fresh and tasty.  Luckily for me, they have no soda machine, so I was left with only (mostly healthy) choices.  :)    I wish they had a few more straight-up vegetarian choices, but I guess anything can be made veggie with tofu, which is pretty sweet.  I'm glad I have lots of summer left to try this place out again."}
{"text":"I stepped in for a quick lunch.  I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap w/ fresh fruit.  The location is cool, although I couldn't tell if they were actually open.  The food was tasty, the fruit was pretty good.  All in all, it fit the bill.  I wanted a quick, healthful, lunch and That's a Wrap provided.  I do wish they were open a bit later because I would love a wrap after a good night of drinking."}
{"text":"A co-worker suggested this lunch spot. I tried one of their rice bowls, the Baja Bowl. Too much sour cream for my taste, but it was good! The bowl comes with your pick of a side, I chose the salsa and chips. Chips tasted store bought, but the salsa was decent.   Great place to order ahead and pick-up, since parking and space are limited during the busy lunch rush."}
{"text":"This joint used to be my favorite work-week lunch at its old location.  Then, I got a new job and was sad I could no longer walk to my favorite wrap wranglers. Amazingly, perfectly, divine-interventionly their new location opened up down the street from my new work!   This place is wonderful for vegetarians - all meaty wraps can be substituted for a delicious grilled tofu, and several wraps are beautifully meat-free to begin with.  My favorite is the Prince of Thais (they have cute names for their wraps).   The selection is large and the portions are generous - I don't think I have EVER finished my whole wrap and side dish in one setting, I usually split it with the boyfriend and we are both full and happy and healthy.   At this new location there is plenty of parking, and seating, and a large outdoor patio.  They are also expanding their hours and getting an alcohol license."}
{"text":"Lets start out by saying I'm on a diet....yes I am... I think....anyway looking for some \"healthier\" options I found this place by of course using yelp and was sold as soon as I saw the buffalo chicken wrap. The wrap was very good the sauce was not so spicy but they had some hot sauce to compensate for my fire loving side. Over all very clean place, friendly staff, and nice atmosphere! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been going to That's A Wrap since it first opened down on 7th Street.  I could walk there from my office on nice days so that was a plus.  Now that they've moved, I don't make it there quite as often, but I still like the place!   Prince of Thai's is my favorite, and Sherry Amore is great, too.  Outdoor seating is MUCH better than the old location and it's a great little mid-day retreat. Prices are reasonable for today's $."}
{"text":"That's A Wrap is my #1 fav lunch spot and I'm so happy that they moved to their new location at 800 East Camelback Road! FINALLY the parking issue has been resolved! You can now officially park your car without being worried about getting blocked in - a common problem at the previous location. I had a coupon for $2 off, and decided to stop by the first day they opened the new spot just to check it out... the line was out the door. No joke that is how scrumptious this place is. The staff is also really awesome and friendly - you can tell that they are appreciative of their loyal customers.   The My Sherry A'more wrap is heaven... Freshly sautéed spinach & onions, ripe roma tomatoes, tasty feta, juicy button mushrooms and grilled chicken bathed in a zesty sauce and bundled into a tomato/basil tortilla! Usually I don't like wraps because they tend to be dry, but That's A Wrap knows how to do it right! I would also recommend their rice bowls as well, so delish (specifically the veggie bowl & bangkok bowl). Also, if you are a fellow tofu fan, you MUST sub tofu in your dish. They grill the tofu, and it is oh so good! Even though you'll most likely have to wait in a long line for your food, it is so worth it.   My advice is to call ahead with your order, so that if you do have to wait in a line to pay at the register you don't have to wait again for your order to be made. I would also recommend hitting this place up early or after the lunch hustle and bustle, that way you can call ahead and avoid the line all together.  BTW - Love the new outdoor patio! Great seating and the atmosphere is casual. The perfect place when you need a workday break from being stuck inside an office."}
{"text":"i love everything about this place except its location.  I got into it last summer when my boss introduced me to the thai wrap. As of recently I began getting the thai bowl though and I always get the pasta salad as my side, ALWAYS!  I love the outdoor patio area, the staff is nice & they do a 6 dollar lunch special.   They also have date night, you'll need to double check but I believe its M&T 20 dollar for two meals and a drink.. definitely something to look into.   My suggestions: Arcadia location & breakfast wraps :)"}
{"text":"We came here looking for something light to eat.  Definitely light and definitely good!!  The waiter was very nice, likes to call you hun, love, sweetie.  He was also patient with us since it was our first time there and didn't know what to order.  We got the chicken wrap, teriyaki tofu bowl with fruit and gazpacho.  First time having gazpacho so I can't compare it with any other place but I thought it was good.  Wish they gave more fruit so my daughter could eat more of it but it's all good.  I really liked the teriyaki tofu bowl.  The sauce isn't overpowering like some places her and it wasn't \"congealed\" like a lot of teriyaki bowls can get so definitely a plus!  If you are looking for a decent place to eat with simple food, simple ingredients, this is definitely a place to stop by!  Great lemonade and iced tea, too!"}
{"text":"Any sandwich wrap special named the Paris Stilton gets extra points in my book.  It was a tough decision between the partygirl/jailbird-inspired wrap or, the Tipper and AlbaGore Tuna, the Ken and Barbie Que, and the Very Brady Clubster. Beyond the cutesie named sammies, is some decent (and healthy) lunch grub.  The menu is basically just wraps, salads and rice bowls.  The digs are real cute in a boho-chic, let's-open-a-restaurant-in-an-old-house sort of way.  The wrap itself (Very Brady Clubster) was WAY better than I expected.  Typical club ingredients with sun-dried tomato mayo and cornbread stuffing (almost polenta like) that really OUTDID itself.  Highly recommend.  The bowtie farfalle pasta salad was a bit oily for my liking, but they also have chips and salsa and fruit salad as alternatives.  Tons of veggie options here, as the owner here also owns Green in Scottsdale.  Tofu can be substituted on anything here.  It can get crazy packed around lunchtime with downtown suits on weekdays so def. check out on Saturday if you can.  The line was about 10 peeps deep at Noon and parking was a bit scarce.  Damn Gina."}
{"text":"The counter staff is phenomenal.  There is always a line and he is very cool headed and takes everyone's order concisely.  The problem that I have had here is that the two times I have visited, they have messed up my order 3 times.  Yes, you read that correct THREE TIMES.  One time it was fixed quickly and today it was messed up twice.  I am not sure what the kitchen staff is doing back there, however, the wait time and accuracy is ridiculous.  I won't go back due to the fact that they have goofed 3 times out of 2 visits.  Food is very good, when made to order."}
{"text":"I'm a wrap kinda gal. I think most culinary delights are packaged quite well in a lil tomato basil tortilla to create a compact and hand held meal, and for this reason I just love That's a Wrap. They've moved past the standard 'throw the caesar salad in a mission tortilla' dealio and graduated to, one of my favorite creations, My Sherry Amore: grilled chicken, spinach, sauteed button 'shrooms, grilled onions, feta cheese, all in a super snug casing of homemade tortilla and it's warm to boot!   If you're feeling über carb conscious, don't let this tortilla heaven scare you off because they will put any wrap creation's contents atop a bed of romaine or spinach.   Big thumbs up for: fresh comida and lemonade, smiling staff, and yummy pasta salad.  The ONLY, not so irritating I might add, issues are: limited parking and pseudo long lines (note: this only applies during lunch rush)"}
{"text":"The wrap (Veggie Jackson) I got was amazing.  The vegetables were cooked just right (not too soft but cooked enough to get that right crunch without it being still being raw) with the perfect mix of rice and feta cheese.  This place was introduced to me by my best friend and her husband, and they were spot on.  I ordered a side of their lentil soup and that was equally tasty.  I also like the concept of their menu - simple and fresh.    The service was good, and the place clean with plenty of seating inside and out.  Now if only they will open a location in SoCal that will be great!  I definitely plan on going back the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years, from the old location to the new and can never get enough! I'd eat here every day of the week if I could. Everything is very fresh and well presented. They have a great selection of items with fun names and the staff is always friendly and helpful.  They serve the wraps or bowls, beer, run a great lunch special, and have a killer Thai Chicken wrap!  Highly recommend That's a Wrap for anyone looking for a healthy meal or if you are a vegetarian."}
{"text":"The people are friendly and the ingredients in each wrap are masterfully selected. So why only two star? They don't mix the ingredients together very well which makes for a lame meal. I want to have a bite of lettuce, cheese, chicken, and tomato. Not a bite of cheese, then a bite of lettuce, etc."}
{"text":"This place is cute & delicious! I love it because they have a unique menu, with just the right amount to choose from. Price is right. I'm pleased. I love variety & going to a new place every week, but That's A Wrap is def one of those rare places I'll eat at often. Love it!"}
{"text":"Quite frankly this establishment if you like absolutely tasteless overpriced vegan hippie food with all the attitude of hipster lassez faire service.  This is the place to go..."}
{"text":"Man, if I wasn't scared to death to park in That's a Wrap's death trap of a parking lot, I'd be there all the time. The wraps are awesomely huge and a tremendous value, and they really put together some killer flavor combinations.  Last time I was in I grabbed the In Like Fin, which packs ahi, mango salsa, a peppery ginger slaw and garlicky rice into a tomato basil tortilla. I couldn't finish the thing.   And, as a bonus, the people behind TAW are opening a new concept soon. Keep your peepers peeled!"}
{"text":"I was surprised how good the quality of the food actually was. Why? I'm not sure exactly but perhaps it has to do with all the shitty food I've been having over the last few days on my roadtrip. I had one of the veggie wraps and it was quite delicious with fresh ingredients and unlike most veggie bean wraps, not so many beans as to be overwhelming---disgusting. My only qualm was the cashier who was a bit haughty but it could just be a bad day for her and since she didn't really wait on me as you order at the counter, I can't really deduct stars for it.  Go, try it, you'll like the food."}
{"text":"I don't understand what the hype is with this place. Maybe it's because I'm not a hipster, but I was not impressed. I've given this restaurant three tries because the reviews are so great and I've just never been thrilled. Each time I tried a different wrap, and not one has excited me. The best thing I had was the pasta salad, which I've still had better at other places. The place is also always super crowded and takes forever to get your food. I was even forgotten once and ended up waiting 30 minutes. Always fun. Lastly, I was so excited when I saw they had hibiscus tea (yum!)...it was disgusting. So bitter and didn't even taste remotely like tea. I've had hibiscus tea at other places and it has never tasted like that. Makes me shudder to think about. Maybe it was old. Anyway, I will not be back. Enjoy, hipsters!"}
{"text":"My friend and I grab lunch once a week here at That's A Wrap.   I would give them 5 stars if a) I found a wrap or dish that knocked me off my feet and b) the service was better. Don't get me wrong, I've tried a lot of wraps and liked them all. I just haven't found that something that you crave at every local eatery. I do try to get the special every time it changes, and those have been hits and misses (Chocolate sauce on my chicken? Really?). My lunch date gets the same damn thing every time (Alota Fajita), so I'm sure she'd give them 5 stars.  The service is nothing to write home about, but at least they haven't fudged anything up or been jerks intentionally. They're fast, I'll give 'em props for that.  Lately the walls have been bare of awesome artwork-- recent repainting? If that's the case, I can't really tell of any improvements."}
{"text":"Maybe it's an AZ thing, but I had more wraps during my few days in Phoenix than I've had all year...  Gabi K and I were setting up for a big pARTy and decided to order some grub for all the nice peeps helping us.  Knowing we'd be likely to eat lots of junk at the party we decided on something healthy beforehand....and That's A Wrap was conveniently located near the Phoenix Art Museum (the scene of the party).  We placed an order for 15 wraps and asked them to throw in some water bottles, fruit, chips, and cookies (so much for being healthy) as well.    The delivery guy showed up with our wraps and there were so many good ones to choose from.  They all had creative names (Ken and Barbie-Que, The Very Brady Clubster, The Godfather, etc). I finally settled on the Senorita No-Meata, which may have just been the best wrap I've ever had: grilled peppers, onions, black beans, corn, garlic rice, and cheddar cheese all wrapped in a jalapeno tortilla. Ummmm.....YUM!  The bag of chips were so addicting and I found it impossible to eat just a bite of a cookie (go figure).  The fruit looked good as well, but of course I ignored that to focus on the chips and cookies.  That's a wrap for today...but i'll be back to try more wraps during my next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting for? The Prince of Thai's and Senorita-no-meata are my favorites but they have lots of different wraps. So GOOD! Beware around lunch time (mon-fri) it can get pretty busy and you might be waiting for 20 minutes to order and get your food. If time is of the essence pre order your food.   **Yes parking is a pain and lunch time gets packed for all you men out there .  .. . . this place has tons of meat packed wraps for your taste buds too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite wrap/sandwich place in Midtown/Phoenix. It's always good and never lets me down. Good portion sizes to be full but not stuffed, fresh produce and great tasting flavor combos. Simple but effective. Plus the strawberry water is delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious!  B introduced me to this place because he eats here at least twice a week, and my god, I now understand why. They have the most delicious wraps I have ever tasted in my entire life!  Fresh delicious ingredients that are actually healthy for you.. and I love nothing more than healthy food that doesn't taste healthy at all.. for instance, the teriyaki 90210.. Grilled teriyaki chicken, crunchy veggies, fresh ginger slaw & jasmine rice.. amazing! Rocky VII, who doesn't love cheese-steak?? Not the healthiest choice they have to offer, but goddamn delicious. Ive also tried the Gringo Star which is the mexicany wrap and The Godfather with salami, ham and my favorite, provolone. I usually get the pasta salad to accompany my lunch, which is also, very yummy. Ive literally never tried anything here my mouth didn't instantly fall in love with.   Really, the only thing that sucks about this place is the parking lot.. its tiny! You're lucky if  you can even find a spot during the lunch rush, and if you do, you're lucky if you can get your vehicle out of there once you've parked. People create their own spots at this joint, sometimes behind your car.. but really, park across the street and walk if you have to, it is absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"i am really happy right now, cause i just had round 2 of my wrap from that's a wrap!  but...Wow, i didn't realize how lucky i was to beat the lunchtime crowd here. I have been meaning to go here for several months, but like our first reviewer, can't go out of my way when during their normal biz hours.  but, i had heard so much about it, i like green so much that i jumped at the chance to stop by after a rare 10 a.m. downtown meeting. i got there at about 11:30 and there was plenty of parking (by plenty i mean only three of the lots 10 or so spots were occupied), but, even though i knew what the building looked like from driving past its closed doors so many times before, i still cruised right on past while heading south on 7th st. i went into the second entrance to the lot that wraps behind the building and oops! that's an exit only. i had to do some fancy manuevering and a 3-point-turn (haven't lost my skills since driving test '98 - woot!) to face the right way and get into a spot.  normally, i would be pretty annoyed at all this, but i was too excited to try a refreshing vegetable-heavy wrap on such a damn hot day. and that's a wrap! did not disappoint. while i waited for my companion, i looked over the menu and was surprised at how many of the items were hot or grilled. i was kind of heartbroken until i saw the daily special, chicken salad with avocado, lettuce, veggie mayo in a flavored wrap (all the tortillas are flavored, making the choosing process that much more painstaking).  once i had my order on lockdown, i checked out the art on the walls of this early 1900's house-turned cafe. not my taste (the subjects were robotic kind of monsters with drippy limbs, i thought of pink floyd the wall, while my friend likened it to what a 15 yr old metal head stoner doodles during class) although they had skateboard art, also, which was better. then i picked up a java magazine and flipped through it...basically, if you come alone, you won't look like a loser, there's plenty to keep you busy.  blah blah blah - long story short, the wrap was great, although on sides menu i chose \"house chips\" thinking they would homemade potato chips, but were just store bought tortilla chips. lame. friend got the pasta salad which was much better, i recommend that. plus, they cut the burrito sandwich in half and have bags and plastic wrap right there at the drink station, so you can easily get two meals (hence my being happy at round #2) and i was happy i didn't have to   a. wait in line forever just to get my wrap travel-appropriate   or  b. feel like a jerk and cut in front of everyone just to get my wrap travel-appropriate  now, i am sad because i probably won't be back for another couple months, but only because it's not closer."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Seriously, a place in Phoenix that is locally owned, has great prices, great food and buys local is pretty hard to find. My favorite wrap is the Gardin'n salad as a wrap. My only complaints about this place are the hours and the parking! But still well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing. The food is super fresh and incredibly well made. However because it's fresh and made to order it does take a little longer to get food out to their guests."}
{"text":"That's A Wrap caught my eye on a trip out to Phoenix shortly before I moved here. I had high hopes going in and it exceeded my expectations.  I love the veggie wrap with jasmine rice paired with a refreshing and delicious glass of strawberry lemonade."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here about every other week. I've tried most of their wraps, homemade soups, and a few of their bowls. I've never had a bad meal here, it's a great place to go to get a healthy, reasonably priced, fast meal. They have really good iced tea and fresh lemonade, and their staff is always really nice. Also, they now have a $6 daily special. I would highly recommend That's a Wrap."}
{"text":"Just about everything you can ask for in a lunch place: tasty, efficient, healthy and reasonably priced. A little expensive, but reasonable.   I really like this place. Almost everything I've ever had on the menu is good, including the often overlooked rice bowls (which I actually prefer over the wraps).   The vegetables they use in their wraps and bowls are fresh and delicious. Whatever you decide to order, try to make sure it has broccoli in it...it tastes like they picked it this morning.  They're a little short on sides (I'd pass on the chips and salsa), and the parking is a pain in the ass.   My biggest complaint about this restaurant is (what else) it's only open for lunch. HELLO! There are people who live in downtown Phoenix! We need places at which we can eat dinner! Contrary to popular belief, this is not a zip code in which people work during the day, have lunch, and then depart. We are here at night too! Feed us!!!"}
{"text":"Go-to \"healthy\" burrito spot. (Wraps are burritos with a fancier name.)  Let me tell you, besides the Fajitas On that I get every time, that strawberry water drink is addicting. I was so blown away the first time I had it, it was embarrassing.   I lied earlier. I once tried the Buffalo 66, so technically I don't get the Fajitas On EVERY time. But both are delicious. Now, that is not a lie."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot in town. I love the daily $6 daily wrap specials!   So the staff here are amazingly polite and are great will regulars, welcoming them back am remembering not only faces but also names.   I'm always on the lookout for healthy places to eat in town and this is definitely one of them. All of the wraps can be prepared as salads and tofu can be substituted for meat.  Lets not forget that happy hour starts at three and did I forget to mention their deserts? Brownies, cookies, and carrot cake. Yum!"}
{"text":"Convenient location on my 15 block commute home from work...but I wouldn't give stars for convenience...the food HAS to be worthwhile.  This was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I really like this place!  Great healthy choices for lunch and it is not that expensive.  Both times I have come I have had the My Sherry A'more it is grilled chicken, white onions, button mushrooms, and fresh baby spinach sauteed in a robust sherry sauce, with diced roma tomatoes, jasmine rice, and feta cheese wrapped in a tomato basil tortilla... YUMMY!  This is going to be one of my regular lunch places now.  Also they have a strawberry lemonade that I am sipping right now that is so refreshing!"}
{"text":"I rather enjoyed the place & the atmosphere.  It's a small restaurant with an extremely small parking lot.  It reminded me of a hippie restaurant you might find in Berkeley, CA.  I really enjoyed my Very Brady wrap.  However, the portions were a little small, but maybe it was because I had almost nothing to eat that day."}
{"text":"I frequent That's A Wrap for lunch.  I order the Veggie Jackson wrap and an ice tea most of the time.  Every now and then I will order the Senorita No Meata wrap or the Cyprus Salad.  There Wraps are very tasty.  The recipes for the wraps are genius and they are named cleverly.  When you order a wrap you get a choice of a side.  Try the pasta salad...THE BEST, or fresh fruit.  Healthy fresh food keeps me coming back to That's A Wrap year after year.  The restaurant is an old house from the looks of it.  They added an outside patio a few months back.  Every now and then they will have incredible art work on their walls.  That's A Wrap is an eco-friendly restaurant that uses bio degradable cups and they recycle.  They care about the Earth.  If you are ever in the mood for tofu try the owners other restaurant, Green."}
{"text":"I really enjoy That's A Wrap... all of the food I've ordered here has been really enjoyable, plus it's all a really good value for the money. My favorite wrap here is the Prince of Thai, sin pollo con tofu. The Veggie Bowl is also another good option and I'm pleased they can make anything vegetarian. Worth a stop for lunch, however, the parking lot is tight and I have been here more than once when it was full."}
{"text":"This is the kind of faux genius I am:  I went to the wrap place and got a bowl.  Truth be told though, it was the right move, at least for me.  On a day when I was newly in town and running on fumes, That's a Wrap saved my bacon with some BBQ.   Unsurprisingly, I have a soft spot for BBQ, and the bowl available here shows up tasty, packed thorough with veggies and rice, and warm chicken doused in BBQ.  If you're going, get there early as the place was jam-packed when we hit around lunchtime, but even so, service was quick and we were able to procure a table without too much waiting.  Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I definitely wouldn't mind stopping back in."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is just delicious!  We stopped in for a quick lunch yesterday and both enjoyed the teriyaki bowl with a pasta salad side.  The portion was large, the food was extremely fresh and very flavorful.  The wraps and salads looked just as tasty...next time!"}
{"text":"i haven't actually tried this place so, i wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt so, there's a four-star rating.  However, the reason i am writing the review is because i find it really annoying that \"that's a wrap\" puts delivery on this thing and DOESN\"T DELIVER.  when i called the girl said that they deliver catering orders only.  you guys already checked the catering box, don't check the delivery box.  it makes you come up  when you do a search on delivery places and that's just annoying!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The fun names will bring a smile to anyone. And the wraps are killer.  Ken & Barbie Wrap (spicy BBQ) this lunch break to fix this slump of a mood I woke up in. Just the right of BBQ lovin' inside the mix, making this wrap so so yummie. Messy but oh so good  WooHoo thank you Stevie for the extra fruit"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I use to work at the Wells Fargo next door and use to eat here everyday! They are a tad bit pricey but the buffalo salad and the Mexican salad is bomb!!!!! Never had a wrap though lol. They have great pasta and chips! Must go."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always friendly service and always delicious food! It has a unique friendly atmosphere that I love. I brought about 10 wraps to a work meeting once and everyone loved them. They're really health conscious and I like that you can get a wrap or a salad on any item. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"When I saw that this place was rated four stars overall, I thought that was perfect. This is a workhorse of a lunch place. Never bad, a diverse enough menu to allow it to be enjoyed frequently without getting bored of it. I seem to be in a Very Brady Clubster rut recently but really everything on the menu is great. I would say that the wraps are about a dollar too much, but you do get a side with them.   Can't really delve into too much more right now because I'm on my way to pick up my lunch there right now."}
{"text":"Good fresh food.  I really like this place, but the line can be a pain.  I would reccomended calling and picking up your order... also parcking is an issue... Not the cheapest lunch place but that is to be expected since it is fresh and not a Roli Poly."}
{"text":"Oh how I love thee. I am going to miss this place. I used to work around the corner and frequent this spot at least 2-3 times per month. I've never had a bad wrap and the rice bowls are good too! The Senorita No Meata is one of my favorites and I love the chips and salsa... it tends to be my side of choice. The parking situation is dumb... don't go at noon. Trust me. If you can carpool that's even better."}
{"text":"I showed up to this little place today with my co-worker. I was wearing business clothes, pressed wool pants' long sleeve shirt etc. I did not fit in or match the decor, but that did not matter.   I read over the menu atop their cast concrete counter full of fun inclusions like a fork. Surprisingly there were several vegetarian options. Even the soup of the day was meat free.   I had \"The Fin\" it was a tuna wrap, but not canned tuna, cooked tuna full of marinated flavor, accompanying it was a mango salsa, purple cabbage slaw and garlic white rice in a red tortilla. I opted for the jalapeno cabbage soup of the day as my included side. For $7.25   The tuna was great despite looking over cooked, the soup was truly great. I do not like soup but I liked this soup, it was creamy without cream and had a great spice note.   The service was fast and friendly. Moreover, our food came in a neat little bread loaf tin.   There is a small patio both front and back and indoor tables and high tops. Parking is a bit tight.   This is what a lunch place should be. I will be returning"}
{"text":"Great variety of different wraps here! Try them out if you haven't they're bound to have something that you like and it is a great lunch spot. The lemonade is also pretty good and the staff that works here is really nice. Will be back!"}
{"text":"New location, longer lines and busier kitchen.  I was a big fan of this place at their old location, the new one is a bit far for me, but the parking situation is much improved.  We walk in the door and encounter a line out to the door, the line is moving very slowly as the phone and the orders on it seem to take priority over us. The menu is the same, wraps, bows and salads. Many veggie options, in fact most wraps can be made with tofu for $.50 extra.  A $8 wrap includes one side, fruit, pasta or chips. Not cheap but not bad.  I had my usual favorite The fin, Ahi tuna mango rice in wrap form. This time I was not all to happy as my tuna was over cooked until it was hard and dry, I did like the seasonings on it. The tortilla was also a bit hard and could have benefited from a bit of steaming.    On the hot sauce side of life there is Tobasco, Couloua and Siriacha on tap.  Drop in early or be prepared to wait, and wait,  and wait. Even if you call in your oder you must wait in the line."}
{"text":"First time. Love the decor and employees are friendly.  I got the Tarragon wrap.  Lots of flavor, however the chicken was dry and there was too much celery and not enough grapes. Salsa and chips were good, really good. Would come and try something else if I'm on the area."}
{"text":"If I lived in the area, this would be a go-to lunch spot for me.  Very affordable - my buffalo chicken wrap was $7.80 and my cucumber-infused water was complementary - nice outdoor seating and great service!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I love and miss this place!  I had a wrap today and it made me miss That's A Wrap!  PA needs a specialty wrap destination so badly.  The quality of products is outstanding and the service is quite special as well.  I will visit for sure when I make it back to AZ.  I miss your amazing food!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have amazing soup and everything I've tried on the menu so far has been great. It's nice to have a casual meal at a reasonable price and feel good about what you just ate. They are vegan friendly and also allow dogs on the patio.  The staff is also amazing.  It's truly a great spot."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were delicious, but super greasy, I was shocked because it used to be so light at the other location. Have they under new management? I really wanted something healthy, and this was definitely not it."}
{"text":"Very Brady Club & Bird's the Word are my faves. Love the side choices: fruit, salsa & chips, or pasta pesto salad. Love the pasta salad. Just went for lunch and noticed they got rid of their Coke fountain - so now only teas and a  line of canned \"natural\" sodas. Bit disappointing, because today I really needed a Coke like an addict needs crack. But it's ok. My body should thank me later.  It gets really packed come noon and parking sucks hard. If you're doing this during the workday, I recommend calling ahead & placing an order for pickup. Works brilliantly and you bypass alot of the mayhem.   As mentioned, better hours would invite those who don't work nearby to sample some of their yummy wraps. Wish I could go freely on the weekends...That's A Wrap people, can you hear me?!"}
{"text":"Prior to That's A Wrap moving I would have given this place FIVE STARS. I used to absolutely LOVE this place. Since the change in ownership (basically when they moved) I have found that things at That's A Wrap just aren't quite the same. The menu has drastically reduced in size (nearly half of the wraps were taken off), the cookies are not the same (they used to be my girlfriends ALL time favorite cookie) and some of the wraps names have changed. To me they just seem like unneccessary changes - why change the Senorita No Meata to Seven Amigos??? I mean c'mon - who doesn't want to order a wrap with the name like Senorita No Meata! I have also found that the taste of the food has been hit or miss. Some visits it's great - the pasta salad is on point and the Buffalo 66 is fantastic, while other visits I'm left wishing for more.   My advice to the new owners would be to keep things the way they were! People like me who have been customers for years (and I'm talking close to 9 years) kept coming back because everything was just RIGHT."}
{"text":"That's a Wrap in Phoenix is awesome. The eco- and vegetarian-friendly spot  serves up wraps, bowls and salads using fresh ingredients (mmm, avocado.)  My friends got the Veggie Jackson (includes zuchinni, feta and salsa) and the Prince of Thai's (spicy peanut chicken and fresh ginger slaw.)  My bud Jamel had this to say about the Veggie Jackson:  \"I started dieting recently so in an attempt to avoid any extra calories I decided to forgo meat and try a vegetarian wrap. After looking over the menu for a minute, the \"Veggie Jackson\" with its seemingly random mix of veggies: (zucchini, asparagus, onions, carrots, broccoli and eggplant) was calling out to me. The meal came with a medley of fruit and self serve drink, it wasn't cheap at around $9.50, but I'd eaten here before and knew it'd be worth it.  Our meals came out quickly and my stomach moaned an excited growl at the sight of it. The food looked and smelled fantastic, in fact I am a little concerned Tim and Nicki might have mixed feelings about the way I tore into my meal, my only consolation is they were likely too busy enjoying their own wraps to notice.  Was the food good? Let's just say while I have no plans to become a vegetarian, the promise of meatless meals this tasty definitely makes me less adverse to the idea.\"  I opted for the Senorita No-Meata, a fiesta for your mouth, containing peppers, black beans, corn and rice-it reminded me of a delicious wrap I used to get all the time in college.  The wraps ($7.25 each) come with a side (my pals got fruit salad, and I got pasta salad), and they're filling without that gunky, weighed-down feeling you don't want when you head back to the office.  The place also serves their fountain drinks in recycled cups and offers a recycling station in the restaurant. No wonder there were hippie types mixed in with the business crowd."}
{"text":"Thada boy That's a Wrap...you opened yet another tasty location that's perfect for a quick lunchtime bite!   While in the middle of meeting mania today, I entered into the lunch hour on the road and in Phoenix. I knew I wanted a sandwich and I'd been itching to check out the new That's A Wrap location.   My experience was top notch! I parked right in front, entered the quaint little shop, ordered, got a seat, got my food, ate it and went on my merry little way within a half hour. The service was quick and friendly. They have an open kitchen so you can see your creation getting made and they have desserts tempting you as you order. I went with the Fiesta wrap which was onions, green peppers, avocado, pico and chicken. Delicious! It's the perfect blend of Mexican food in a sandwich and it's a light lunchtime option. It filled me up without stuffing me.   The shop is cute and quaint but has enough seats to accompany a decent size crowd. If the weather wasn't so cold today, I would have opted to sit on the patio in the front All are good options.   This is a great treat for lunch and it gets you in and out in a timely manner.   And that's a wrap for me!"}
{"text":"Thata boy, That's A Wrap...you know what you're doing. I like sandwiches. I do. And I think I'm pretty good at judging a sandwich not only by its cover but by the options for what's inside too. Ladies and gentlemen, this shop has got it going on. If you've ever driven on 7th, you've probably passed it. Does the parking lot look intimidating? It is. But, if you can snag yourself a spot, you're in for a treat. Fresh tortillas, deli-style meat, farmer's market veggies, condiments galore and every wrap combo you can imagine. For the volume of customers, the service is great. There might have been a line out the door during lunchtime, but I got my sandwich in under ten minutes. Not bad. The wraps aren't too big and aren't too small. They're just right. And healthy too.   After such successful experiences, I've decided I need to continue coming up with excuses to find my way to Downtown Phoenix. It's hard to find a good sandwich spot and when I do, it's lust and love at first site. So beware That's A Wrap, you've made a crush out of me."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with a lot of great vegetarian and vegan options. The food is healthy and they try to accommodate any special requests you may have. The prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is closing! It's going to be a sad day for this neighborhood. Always great food and great service."}
{"text":"Known for its flavorful menu of wraps, rice bowls and salads, That's a Wrap has offered healthy food on Seventh Street in Central Phoenix for more than 13 years. The new location, formerly occupied by Lola Tapas, serves up the same affordable food and laid back atmosphere as the original with a fresh, contemporary interior and more space for dining, both indoors and out.   If you've never had a wrap before it's a pretty straight forward design. Take all of your favorite sandwich ingredients, meat, cheese, tomato and dressing then surround them with a tender tortilla and there you have it. The wraps here are generously filled and could satiate some of the biggest appetites, including my own.   The Buffalo 66 ($7.25) encompasses everything that you love about eating chicken wings, my favorite. Were talking thick juicy pieces of grilled chicken, shredded carrots, celery and spicy wing sauce all wrapped up in a herb flavored tortilla. One of the things I enjoy most about this wrap is the contrast between the heat from the sauce and the cooling effect of the dressing, spot on in every bite.   One of the wraps I was most excited about was also the most disappointing I tried. Ordering the Clubster ($7.25) is supposed to get you turkey, ham, bacon, provolone cheese, corn bread stuffing, tomatoes, and lettuce dressed in tomato vinaigrette all wrapped with a wheat tortilla. The problem here was that there were no hints of smoky bacon or savory turkey, just a bland mix of ham, veggies and stuffing. Tearing my wrap open, neither of the two were present as far as I could tell. I'm not writing this one off yet, next time Ill ask them to double check their ingredients.   For the lighter appetite, I use that term loosely, you could order one of their massive salads. Served in a crispy tortilla shell, the Picnic Salad ($7.75) was brimming with fresh spinach, blue cheese crumbles, toasted walnuts all lightly bathed in a wonderfully pungent balsamic dressing. For an additional charge ($.75) you can add tender grilled chicken to the mix.    Each order comes with your choice of chips and salsa, pasta salad, fruit salad or daily soup. Trying a few of the sides, I loved the freshness of their salsa, with little flecks of black char from roasted vegetables. I'd highly recommend my favorite, their homemade pasta salad. The firm texture of their bow tie pasta was additively well dressed; I could have eaten a huge bowl if it were offered.   Sometimes the simplest things are the tastiest like really well done baked goods. TAW doesn't disappoint with their delicious Carrot Cake ($2.75). Each bite had a nice chewiness from the cream cheese frosting and dense moist crumb of the cake. The spices were well balanced and I loved that there were flecks of shredded carrot you could actually see in every forkful.   Be sure to check their website for specials including great deals on bottles and glasses of wine. I know where I'll be on Saturday night."}
{"text":"during a work conference in PHX, we found this place on yelp while suffering through 2 days of 8 hour lectures. we liked that it was close to the venue, it was quick, and they offered all their wraps and salads with the substitution of tofu.   it's been about a month, so i don't recollect what i ordered, but apparently it was so good, we ate there for lunch both days. service was really friendly and fast. the cucumber water was delightful. prices were average and the size of our wraps was enough to keep us full."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this place.  The space is adorable, simple and clean.  The staff is uber friendly and courteous.  The food is absolutely delish.  I ordered the Prince of Thai with chips and salsa.  For me, the portion was perfect - filling without being too much (right amount of rice, especially, which can leave you feeling overstuffed). My wrap had a slightest kick to it which was welcomed.  I normally love a whole lot of spice, but sometimes just the faintest amount can do wonders. I found the salsa flavorful as well.   I can't think of anything subpar about this joint, and I can't wait to go back and try a new menu item!"}
{"text":"My absolutely most favorite-est place for lunch.  I'm not really into wraps - so that's not what I eat here.  But it's the best Greek salad (get it with chicken) I have ever had, and when I worked down there, I used to get it 2-3 times per week, split it in half, and have the second half for lunch the next day. Oh, and the other thing.... I am WAY picky about chicken. I usually end up picking off half the chicken from any salad, because I'm a purist.  If you're anything like me, you'll have no problem here.  Not to mention, this is the only place I know that carries Zevia - soft drinks made with the herb stevia - no sugar, no artificial MS, cancer-causing crapola."}
{"text":"Just went there tonight because i had a groupon for it. It was great! Very filling yet in a good non-greasy non-nasty way. I decided to go the vegetarian route and had the  \"seven amigos.\" very flavorful. My husband had the \" gringo star\" and he enjoyed his as well. I also agree with others that the pasta salad is very good. It is a very small amount of the salad, but somehow it seemed perfect. The icing on the cake is that they have \"mexican\" coke ;) very small place but very enjoyable and homey. Ill definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a quick bite to eat that is healthy.  Although I would forgo the \"wrap\" and just go with the bowl if you really want to be healthy.  Patio is a nice place to sit and eat on a beautiful spring day in AZ."}
{"text":"over. rated.  the wraps are ok, but for the price, i'd expect a little more flavor/seasoning. the wait-staff is kinda rude. one of the guys was walking past me while i was waiting in line, and instead of asking me to step aside, he grabbed my shoulders and pushed me out of his way. didn't say a word. no joke.  and then the receipt printer got jammed, and my friend helped fix it - and they BARELY thanked him. classy.  lastly, when they brought out our food, the server gave my husband my wrap - but called it by the name of the one he ordered, and vice versa with mine. we ended up eating a bunch of the wrap until we realized that we had the wrong wrap. ok, so maybe that was partially our fault, but you'd think that the staff would know what they were bringing out???  the bottom line is that this place (and the staff) is pretentious, a bit over-priced, and... not a place that i would patronize again.  ***EDIT*** M.G., thank you for your kind offer to allow my friends and I to return, as well as for your apology; however I do not wish to return to your restaurant, nor do i wish  to discuss the matter further. I am not making any accusations, merely writing honestly about my experience, and thus I stand by my review."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place that's quick, healthy, and not the same old sub-sandwich, then That's a Wrap is the place for you. The people who work there are very nice, they have awesome lemonade , and all their sandwiches and wraps are made fresh and to order. Don't be afraid to customize your order as they are happy to do it. Sitting out on the patio is also great for people watching."}
{"text":"I used to work right around the corner from this place and really enjoyed it!  The Bad: The parking DOES suck around noonish, but lets be honest, how many places in the Central Phoenix area have ideal parking? It's definitely better than downtown Phoenix....parking wise that is.   I love the \"Bird is the Word\", \"Gringo Starr\", \"Rocky VII\", and the chips and salsa and pasta salad sides. Also, the jasmine iced tea is really good. Honestly, this place is one of the coolest lunch places around Central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I took advantage of That's A Wrap for their catering services yesterday and once again, was totally impressed!  I called around 10am for a 5pm delivery... I wanted to make sure that those of us who were working at the Phoenix Art Museum all day preparing for the pARTy had some fuel to get us through the evening.  Sure enough, That's A Wrap delivered - literally and figuratively.    I ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, and bottled water - it was perfect!  Everything was delicious!  It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating.  I had the \"Godfather\" wrap (Salami, ham, and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato, red onion, sun-  dried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil).  I don't usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason, this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday - and it was!  Thanks That's A Wrap for fueling me and all of the yelper helpers for the pARTy... I'll be back to visit soon!"}
{"text":"I fell in food love at the original That's a Wrap location, and I fell once again at the new location today... I'm a huge fan of the casual atmosphere, modest prices, and of course the wraps, sides, and salads at this place.  I went for lunch today and had the Greek Salad and black bean soup as my side.  One friend had the albacore tuna on a wheat wrap with a side of fruit and another had one of the specialty wraps with a side of pasta salad.  We were all pleased with our food.  The only negative is that I don't think this place has air conditioning, so I hope they get some fans or install a/c before the temperatures rise.  Regardless, I'll be back, even just for carry-out or to check out their \"wrappy hour.\""}
{"text":"I stopped by before dance today for a slice of cake. The young lady that helps me was so kind and friendly. I felt like I was hanging out at my friends house. I recommend going, even if it's for a slice of home made cake :-) can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"That's A Wrap may have great wraps, but I love their bowls.  The food here is great.  They have interesting specials too.  \"The Best\" chips & salsa, not really, but pretty good.  Pretty much everything can be made vegetarian, which is awesome.  Brown rice is good, but not worth an extra $1.00, sorry.   The parking kind of stinks, but if you can't find parking, don't expect a seat.  Atmosphere is pretty cool, I love the artwork that changes each time I go there.  Service could use a boost of friendlyness."}
{"text":"My new fav!! :) We have to go down town about once a week, and we always end up eating bad food, but I wanted something healthy, and I noticed That's A Wrap. I ordered the Price of Thai or something like that on Monday and it was great. Both the Hubby and I were down town on Wednesday and we were starving, so we went back and he got the buffalo 66 and I got the Who's the Turkey, ooohhhh my gosh they were AWESOME! the buffalo 66 could cure my hardcore wing cravings and I have not stopped wanting another Who's the Turkey! I am going to go down the line and try every wrap every time I get to go!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Loved the atmosphere. Loved the concept. Loved the patio. Loved the people. And really really liked the food. I am going to try out a few other items before allotting them their fifth star, but the fajita chicken wrap was pretty tasty. And the lemonade was delicious.  I can't believe it took me so long to check this place out. I will be back soon and will hopefully be updating my review with an extra star. And...that's a wrap.     (Get it???)"}
{"text":"Soooo I'm WAY late on my review for this place since it's one of my FAVORITE lunch spots!  I absolutely cannot get enough of this place.  Gabi K was nice enough to introduce it to me, and I ran into her there a week later! haaaaa!  It's so yummy with lots of options.  So many I could probably eat there for a month straight and not run out of options.  Just like the name says, everything is a wrap (or a salad if you're not cool enough) and there's something for everyone!  It's very reasonably priced and you're sure to leave full.    One thing I hate is the parking..... It's a cute downtown old house conversion, and they max out on parking so get there early, or late if you're anything like me!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is ALWAYS fabulous and healthy.  The art on the walls is changed out monthly and the staff always friendly.  A great place to chill with a book or the New Times over lunch, they are not open for dinner.  The Prince of Thai's Wrap, is the best and the pasta salad is the best I have ever had.  No mayo !  Also, you can get a \"frequesnt visitor\" card and after 9 meals get the 10th one free, which trust me, does not take long!  5 stars, always :)"}
{"text":"One of those places you pass by a hundred times before stopping in. I'm glad I changed that over the summer after the lunch special caught my eye. I ordered the  The Gringo that day. Unreal. I was completely hooked and proceeded to return a dozen times over the following month. I've tried nearly everything on the menu at this point. The quality is as consistent as the service and there really isn't much I don't care for. The staff is a blast and I always enjoy conversing with them. Orders are served up quickly with consistently fresh-tasting ingredients. I'm amazed there is only one location but understand that this is a sort of side project for the owner. Simply one of the best lunch spots in PHX."}
{"text":"I really enjoy That's A Wrap! I want to use an exclamation point, because I feel like they do too! I'm a sucker for kitsch so I love the names of their wraps such as the Veggie Jackson & the Ken and Barbie-Q. I like the interior-- it seemed clean with very interesting artwork and lots of local business/event paraphernalia which I always appreciate seeing around town. I had the Prince of Thai's on a recommendation from the guy at the counter & I thought it was quite tasty as was the pasta salad. Maybe a little too much rice. The service was really quick, I ordered my wrap to go and I had barely sat down and someone from the back had brought it out to me all packed to go with a nice little \"That's A Wrap\" sticker, and I was out the door.  The wraps are $7.25 with a side of either chips & salsa, pasta, or fruit. Together it makes for a filling meal without being stuffed. I will definitely be back there were many items on the menu that spurred my interest plus it is right down the street from my house."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to stop for lunch when I'm in Central Phoenix. Although I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer to eat healthy and I'm always on the lookout for restaurants that cater to my love of fresh veggies and fruit.    These wraps are huge, fresh and flavorful, and I've tried several.  I especially like theThe Veggie Jackson which has Sautéed Zucchini, Asparagus, Onions, Carrots, Broccoli, Eggplant, Feta Cheese, Balsamic Salsa and Garlic Rice in a Spinach Tortilla.    The wraps also come with your choice of  side; either homemade pasta  salad, fresh fruit salad, famous chips & salsa or soup.  I always get the fresh fruit.  A word of warning though, while these wraps are good, most of them are messy.  It's not something you can eat in the car.  Best to stop and grab a table and a knife and fork and enjoy.    Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love supporting such local businesses in my neighborhood- and you should too!  If I worked in the area, it would be in my lunch rotation.  The customer service here rocks- it appears as if they actually care if you enjoy the food you have ordered.  I appreciate this and think they deserve a huge kudos on that one.  The hours are pretty ridiculous- they close at 5 on weekdays and are open from 10:30-3:30 on Saturday's.  I've had the Route 66 (Buffalo chicken) and the Ringo Starr and have enjoyed them, but it wasn't true love.  Don't get me wrong, fair choices but no real excitement.  The Sirachi chili sauce helps out- but I love that stuff.  A solid choice, although not mind blowing in any stretch of imagination."}
{"text":"In town from Chicago, found this place and must say, great food especially the just-made pumpkin soup. Fair prices and nice friendly personnel. We had 2 wraps and a Baja bowl. All were excellent and will come back again."}
{"text":"That's a Wrap is one of the best kept secrets in Arizona. The food is absolutely phenomenal. All of the cleverly named wraps (Ken and Barbie-Que, Tipper And Alba-Gore Tuna, Cheech and Dijon Chicken, Alota Fajita, Etc.)  are made from fresh ingredients and include a side dish of your choice for an incredibly reasonable price. They have a daily special as well as a home-made daily soup selection. That's a Wrap is also very accommodating to vegetarians (you can select tofu as a replacement in any of the meat based wraps). The atmosphere is casual, colourful and relaxed. The owner is super friendly and is very supportive of the phoenix art and music scenes. The work of local artists typically adorns the walls. That's a Wrap is one of my absolute favorite arizona spots. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Cool and Creative Names and ingredients how could you not love this place!  I had the \"Who's the Turkey\" which  was, Grilled turkey breast dressed with cream cheese and cranberry relish with fresh mixed greens, alfalfa sprouts, sliced pickles, and red onion wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla  with no onions(see pics)  You could put cream cheese and cranberry on anything and it would suddenly become the best thing you ever tasted!  I really  liked it although I'm not sure I prefer tortilla over bread......it was a nice change, I Guess I'm just not used to it.    Especially since a certain Yelper We all know and Love got me worrying about Hydrogenated oils......As far as Ive seen most tortillas (flour) contain it......unfortunately I couldn't get the scoop here...they had already thrown out the boxes that list the ingredients, said I could call in on Wednesday  to confirm.  I'm really hoping it's not listed because that would spoil the healthy kick they've got going on.  Would it stop me from eating here though.....probably not, I'd just get a salad or a rice bowl instead."}
{"text":"after my delicious first wrap, i went in here again and got the alota fajita with beef.  it was disgusting. i had two bites and spit the second one out. the beef was gritty and seasoned weird. the green peppers and onions were stringy and not nicely textured.  my salsa was watery and it had one huge tomato chunk it. the chips were STALE.  wtf, mate?"}
{"text":"Wraps usually make me excited. I get to pretend that I'm being healthier by not eating bread, and instead I'm eating a tortilla that has the names of vegetables in the title and serving as a main ingredient:  Spinach, Jalapeno, and Tomato --- but then there's still Whole Wheat,  Herb, and Plain (but who wants that?). So when That's a Wrap, one of my favorite little stops in the Coronado neighborhood, decided to move-- I was sad. I'm still trying to make the trip to the Camelback location and keep up my dedication. The fact is, when I find something that really knows how to punch my taste buds, it's hard for me to shop around after the fact. So although I've been here many times before, I have only tried a few selections but they totally rock my world.   I would like to discuss the Prince of Thai... If he truly were a prince, I would be his princess. I love the sauce that accompanies this dish. Usually I get it as a salad and with tofu just so I don't get filled up on the meat. The fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico, red onion and garlic rice compliment each other very well.The salads are so copious that you could share them quite easily (ladies)! Also, that's the great thing, you can get any salad as a wrap and vice versa!  The Veggie Jackson, Greek Gatsby, and the Picnic are also delectable. The price for the food is what you can't beat, and they even have a liquor license now (toot toot!)"}
{"text":"I was initially skeptical about this place...my coworker told me about it and orders lunch from here 1-2x/wk.  She likes more plain food than I do, so I assumed it was going to be plain.  I was pleasantly surprised for two reasons...everything can be made vegetarian and anything I don't want can be substituted for something else...so it's a bit like \"design-your-own-wrap\"....  For sure, the Ken and BarbieQ is my favorite, sub tofu and brown rice...corn, rice, blk beans, veggies, and bbq sauce...DELISH!  This place is great for staff lunches...seems like there's something on the menu for everyone.  But beware, lunch time can be a bit difficult, especially parking-wise, because it's packed in here...so CALL ahead and order to go!"}
{"text":"If I could marry a restaurant it would be this. Or maybe Taco Bell, but if I don't want to have a trailer trash wedding than definitely That's A Wrap is a better marriage partner. Their food is DELICIOUS. And their berry lemonade stuff is my fav. I love that all the wraps can have tofu substituted for the meat and its not a huge hassle. A lot of places servers stare at you and can't seem to wrap their heads around the idea of substituting other things in place of meat in the dishes. Here it is totally common and not at all shocking. I love that. The wraps are huge, the sides are delicious and the place is really cute the way it's decorated. Too bad I live so far away or I would be here on the daily. Seriously, stop reading this and go there right now. And if it's not open then camp out until it is, it's that good."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of wraps because they always seemed like a \"healthy option\" (which I could care less about) and I'm a bread lover - the more bread, the better. But I wanted to try something a little different and ended up here.  I opted for the \"The Clubster\" (turkey, ham, bacon, Provolone, corn bread stuffing, tomatoes, Romain lettuce and pesto mayo in a wheat tortilla - but I substituted the tomato for their cranberry relish). Sounds amazing but I couldn't taste much besides bacon, cranberry and Romaine. I'm not sure if it was the balance of ingredients or maybe there were just too many flavours vying for my attentions, but it seemed really bland for something with so many ingredients. I also chose their broccoli and cheese soup as my side, which I also used as a sandwich dip. This had a TON of flavour and would have been perfect if I liked my soup on the spicier side.  I liked the inside a lot - very clean (though it was late on a Monday night and quite empty) with really cool tables and lots of healthier drink options (fresh teas, lemonade, cucumber-enhanced water) as well as a cooler of bottled water and soda. However, it wasn't enough to bring me back - especially with a quite small wrap and cup of unfinished soup costing nearly $10."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I discovered this place. In the land of chain restaurants, this is an adorable local eatery with a focus on fresh, healthy and flavorful wraps and salads.  As a (mostly) vegetarian, I rejoice that every menu offering can be made veggie, by substituting tofu for meat. And I appreciate that the guy at the counter didn't roll his eyes when I explained my dietary restrictions, but was instead super helpful and made great recommendations.  Everything I've had here is delicious and tastes homemade. And I love that they have Reed's Ginger Ale and unsweetened teas.  What a relief from the greasy, salty, meat-focused, chain restaurant food that is the standard fare in Phoenix.  And they will give you a card for a free wrap or salad after you've bought a few meals there.  There is a cute shaded patio for when the weather is nice, and the staff are very friendly and nice, too.  And, extra points for recycling and using compostable utensils!"}
{"text":"If you want a REAL wrap, then I suggest you eat here.   I am enamored of the quality/freshness of ingredients they use in their wraps, as well as the generous amounts of more expensive (protein and cheese, etc.). The care of the \"craftsmanship\" of their food products is just uncanny. I feel like I'm getting a massage and a kiss when I eat their food.  The vibe is cool and comfortable. I don't feel like anyone wld be snarky or snub me here. Another \"safe place\".  Service is always on-point and genuine. Five stars."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place.  They have all these great wrap sandwiches but the salads seemed like an afterthought.  And I try to avoid food carbs, cause I need them carbs for drinking!  So I got the Greek salad and it just seemed plain to me.  I loved all the kalamata olives and abundance of feta, but flavors seemed to be lacking.  Maybe I'll have to get a wrap next time."}
{"text":"Wish I lived or worked closer, but I have been known to drive all the way from Scottsdale on my lunch break. They have an awesome selection of salads and wraps. I love the \"Gringo Star\" with chicken. I recommend calling your order in ahead of time if you want to carry out during the weekday lunch time."}
{"text":"\"Are you sure this is the right place?\" my girlfriend said as we drove up.  I had no idea, as I hadn't been here before either, but we trusted the small orange sign and went on in anyway...  We were greeted by a simple and sweet dining room, complete with comfortable bench seating and hip(ster) decor;  nice.  After looking over the menu for a minute we had settled on a Turk w/ Pasta salad for her and a Buffalo 66 with homemade Pumpkin soup for me.  We each grabbed a cup of the cucumber water and anxiously waited.    When the food arrived, it looked delicious.  Fresh chicken, glazed with buffalo sauce, lettuce, ranch, and carrots were wrapped perfectly in a lightly grilled herb tortilla, accompanied by homemade pumpkin soup, which, we found out, included bits of tomato and avocado as well!  Her \"Turk\" was a non-traditional turkey club (sans bacon), perfectly accentuated by the avocado, chipotle mayo, and accompanying pasta salad.    All in all, we finished our lovely meal longing for more but perfectly satisfied.  If you want to reach that \"perfect full\" with delightfully fresh, homemade food, look no further;  That's a Wrap is your place!"}
{"text":"That's a Wrap turns me into a vegetarian nearly every time I go. And I get hit on by hipster waitresses. I also can't believe I've never reviewed this place until now.  What do I love about That's a Wrap? Everything. The people are awesome. The space is extremely laid back and inviting. They have jameson and ginger ale on their limited cocktail menu. They have homemade lemonade. They pretty much have homemade everything. And I hardly ever get the same thing every time I go.   That's a Wrap knows exactly what to do to please me.  The Tarragon and the Veggie Jackson are probably tied for my favorites. I've always wanted to try the carrot cake, but I'm deathly afraid I'll love it too much.  When I was in a few weeks ago, it took abou 20 minutes for my to go order, and to make it up to me, my next one was on the house. Because this place is awesome."}
{"text":"This is another one of those places that I patronize on a fairly regular basis, but keep forgetting to review, and that's too bad, since this is a great place.  Their food is so good, and so reliably good, that it shouldn't be known as only a wrap restaurant.  I've had several things there, but I get one so often that I've forgotten all the rest.  I love the Thai wrap with the peanut sauce and tofu, with a side of either their excellent soups of the day, or with a side of their excellent pico and chips.  I feel so healthy when I eat here, and i should eat here way more often and lay off the pizza.    The interior of the restaurant is a little tight at lunch, so I recommend the patio if it's open.  I would like to see them in a big airy space, but it's not going to stop me that they are not.    This may sound funny, but I think the presentation of fast food here is the best I've seen for the price.  I like the little containers the food is delivered in, and it always looks so clean and tight, plus the food tastes just as good as it looks.  I really appreciate when people making relatively cheap food make such an effort to make it look good, too.  I would still like coming here if it was sloppy presentation, because it's tasty, but I want the kitchen staff to know that I see their work and that they do an excellent job with aesthetics, as well as taste.      The staff:  always friendly.  It's like they take happy pills.  Maybe they do?  They seem like a family, and that is always lovely.  Also like that they serve beer and wine here, plus Reed's Ginger Ale.  Mmmm, ginger ale.  As a final word: highly recommended."}
{"text":"Bossman saw this place on the news or in some paper or something and wanted to give it a try. Sure glad he did! I had a wrap and he had a rice bowl. The chicken is very, very impressive. When ordering chicken breast at other establishments, I'm used to finding being bits of gristle, or fat, or tough pieces. The chicken at That's a Wrap had none of that! It was soft, tender, moist and lean...perfect! I had the Gringo Star which also had rice, black beans, sour cream, cheese, avocado, lettuce and pico all wrapped in a tomato tortilla. It maybe could have had more avocado because I couldn't really be positive it was in there just by taste. The tortilla was fantastic - soft and delicious. I chose the chips & housemade salsa, which was excellent as well. The salsa was a bit spicier than I had anticipated, but I like spicy. It just didn't seem as generically non-spiced as most other food-place's salsas. Bossman had the Bangkok Bowl (peanut chicken) and said nothing bad about it, although he wasn't sure it had the brown rice he requested (and paid extra for). I came during the normal lunch hour, so the wait was a little longer than I'd like. My lunch is always to-go, so next time I will call ahead to order. The inside is a little cramped, but the outdoor patio seems like a good space. I will definitely be back, hopefully at an off time, and eat in to enjoy their patio!"}
{"text":"What a quaint, cute place.  I had no idea what this place was when I went with a friend, but it's pretty straightforward: they have wraps.   Scanning the menu I was torn and couldn't decide but I went with the tuna.  I love tuna.  This was dark tuna and also had onions, olives and tons of argula.  For extra, you can have your wrap turned into a salad, which I did.  Huge portions and I was full. Each wrap/salad comes with your choice of a side:  soup, pasta salad, fruit.  They have happy hour specials, daily $6 specials, and a $20 date night special.  I still wonder about that greek salad, and my friend loved her turkey wrap so I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"So happy that That's a Wrap moved north and closer to me, thanks That's a Wrap! Expanding there hours was genius, we need more spots like this in CenPho for lunch AND dinner.   Digging the new location and small patio space, the employees seem even more cheerful and friendly then before (if that is even possible).  This is a great spot for a vegan bites, you can customize pretty much every wrap and SURPRISE - it still tastes good!   The Ken and Barbie-que with tofu is awesome. Senorita-no-meata sans cheese is great as well, I've never had a bad meal here - EVER. You can sub grilled tofu on any wrap, bowl or salad. Nothing much else to say besides don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"You know those times when you want to go as far away from your office as humanly possible but know that you still have to be back in an hour to avoid getting bitched at? Well I work in Tempe and That's A Wrap in Midtown Phoenix is so that place for me.  Their food is fresh and delicious, and considering how insane their lunch rush is, they do a pretty solid job of getting you in an out of there pretty damn quickly.  So, let's see. I've been there twice now during my \"I've got to get the F out of Tempe this second or I may actually shoot someone\" moments, and was pleasantly surprised on both occasions. The first time I went, I had the Buffalo 66 wrap, because if you've read a single one of my reviews, you know that I am incapable of saying no to Buffalo Chicken anything. The chicken breast was tender and extremely flavorful and the sauce was nice and spicy. The vegetables were really crisp as well.  The second time I went I got the Alota Fajita wrap mostly because I wanted to see if I could say it out loud without bursting out laughing. No real surprise, I could not. It was your run of the mill fajita wrap, again very tasty and flavorful, but not quite as good as my buffalo chicken wrap.  The place is very vegetarian-friendly, pro-natural ingredients and locally conscious, which I like, but in the business of full disclosure, it was just a little bit much. I don't want to pay $2-$3 for a can of shitty \"all-natural Black Cherry soda.\" Gimme a break. By all means, save those options for the marks with fat wallets that think buying the all-natural soda is making a positive impact on the environment, but do the rest of us a favor and throw some affordable regular ppl options out there as well.  Minor rant aside, I am a very big fan of this place and will continue to flee my office for it."}
{"text":"My first visit to That's A Wrap and I did not have a Wrap. I instead had the Spiced Red Pepper and Gorgonzola Soup. It was good, but I barely got any Gorgonzola flavor. The grilled tortillas they served with it were tasty.   The place is nice enough, but not darling. More Hippy Chic I'd say. It also seemed a bit dirty...or was that the staff?   Parking stinks and the wait was a bit much. I would stop in again for an early or late lunch and try a Wrap next time."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, fast and good. I wish they were open late though."}
{"text":"I was driving by Camelback today looking for a place to eat  when I saw this little green building with a big orange sign that says \"That's a Wrap!\".  I automatically got excited, pulled over, went inside and  I discovered that Damon Brasch (owner of Green & the old that's a wrap on 7th) sold his company and the new owner relocated it here. The place has a modern decor and it's in a great location. The big sign is very easy to find and the place has ample parking. The new owner kept the same menu which is good and improved the beverage list. They now have organic sodas and  offer beer and wine after 5pm! How fabulous is that?  This place is great for vegetarians because they can substitute grilled tofu for meat at no charge. You can order wraps, salads and rice bowls. Delicious! :)  Damon, it you are reading this. Please turn the old location into GREEN! I love the Green restaurant in Scottsdale, but it's so far from where I live. :)"}
{"text":"I have grabbed lunch here a few times now and really enjoy their wraps.  The Thai is a standout closely followed by buffalo chicken.  The ingredients are always incredibly fresh and taste profiles are very nice.  They also understand how mush sauce to put on an item to compliment it and not over due the whole meal.    The pasta salad is particularly amazing, and I would suggest it to everyone."}
{"text":"do you ever walk into a place and just feel cooler for being there? that is what That's a Wrap is like. the ecofriendliness. the witty banter in the menu. the healthiness of the items on the menu. i was a little bit afraid someone would come up to me and accuse me of being a republican and kick me out. (i am not, i just love a good polo shirt), however the staff was really nice and i was super satisfied with my experience."}
{"text":"When I used to work downtown, I would get lunch from here regularly.  The food is fresh and really tasty.  The Gringo Star is my personal favorite....it's a nice alternative when I really want a carne asada burrito but want to be a little healthier!  The only downside is the parking...if the lot is full, you might as well go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I want to preface this to say it sickens me to give this place a 2 star rating.  I've been going to \"That's A Wrap\" for years.  Back when they were on 7th Street and then with the move to Camelback.   I have always loved the food.  It's been a craving at times.  There were times I used to stop off just before they closed and I would visit with the then owner while waiting for my dinner on my way home from work.  I would race out of work just to make it in time.  Lately, and this seems since it has moved to the Camelback location, the food is still very good, however the size of the wraps have drastically decreased.  Last week, I grabbed a wrap to-go and when I got it hope I was like WTF?  I have noticed this decrease slowly happening over time but last week was the limit.  I feel like it's not even worth my time or money to go here anymore.   What happened??  The flavors are still there, but there is some serious cost cutting going on.  If i was to guess, I think the owners are trying to switch this over to a \"corporate\" establishment. This is probably a sad attempt to open more locations.  I don't know what they need to do to make it work, and I hate to say it, but I won't be back until this is fixed."}
{"text":"I always go here for lunch. The food is fresh and yummy. Every wrap and lunch bowl comes with a side of pasta or chips and salsa.   Parking sucks, so try not to go at peak lunch time. I usually go for an early or late lunch."}
{"text":"I really want to give a better rating for this restaurant, but I just can't.  The outside looks very unique from the street, an inviting little bungalow on a busy 7th Street.  Parking is atrocious so walking or riding a bike is highly recommended.  The decor is very urban and hip which I love.  Great artwork and painting on the walls with wood floors thoughout.  On to the food.  I found my wrap that I ordered(Godfather) to be very bland and didn't have much flavor.  I was looking forward to the sundried tomato mayo, which is the reason why I ordered this wrap, but it failed to my liking.  Overall this place is very good, but I don't think it would do well in a true \"Green\" city such as Seattle.  How can you claim to be green and healthy for the enivironment while not having a recycable bin for an organic soda aluminum can?  Maybe I just didn't see a place to put the can, but like everyone else before me I threw it in the trash. I will give it a few more shots here to see if the food grows on me and hopefully I have the chance to recycle as well."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place like this since I was in college a decade ago;  Back when the wrap craze was just getting started.  The ingredients are quality, they are put together in a really healthy way, and the ambiance is pretty hip.  Every time I have been here it has always been full of people.  I wish I lived closer so I could eat here more often.  Trying this place is a must."}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood, and also I should mention, my own place where my mom does not cook dinner every night. Lately I have been subsisting off of Bagel Bites, and today the bf picked up some kind of -ico's or -erto's that made me feel like I was going to explode, so I was craving health food but simultaneously feeling extremely lazy. I remembered a lovely lunch I'd had at That's A Wrap, saw they were open til 8, and drove on over.  I ordered the Thai wrap with pasta salad, and then realized I had forgotten my wallet. For the 2nd time today. Like an idiot. I was about to go home in despair and microwave some mini corn dogs but the cashier was SUPER nice and just gave it to me. I was SO FREAKIN' grateful because I had gotten myself all psyched up for this food.   I LOVE their cucumber water, and I get half homemade lemonade/half blackberry jasmine tea. The place is super cute and small and such an excellent alternative to fast food. Since it's more of a lunch place, it was empty and probably faster than McDonald's with good quality food. I had forgotten how spicy the Thai is but I loved it- and they have those delicious super Asian pickled cucumbers.  I will try to convince the bf to go back for a date night special- we both claim to be attempting to eat healthier. At the least will be back for lazy night takeout and girl time lunches."}
{"text":"I've seen and heard about this place since I've lived on this side of town and have wanted to come here for some time.  I finally made it in yesterday, and it was everything I thought it would be.  Delicious!  The menu is pretty good, and the prices are great. It kind of has a fresh and healthy feel to it, which is great.  I went with the steak wrap, and my friend went with a chicken wrap.  Staff was friendly and helpful, and overall I really enjoyed it.  I love how they serve the meal in a metal bread tray, and I thought it was super cute.  They had limited drink options, so I stuck with water.  Food was tasty and filling, and overall I really liked it here.  They have free wifi here, so its pretty cool that you can bring your computer, hang out and dine here while relaxing on the patio.  Total bill for two lunches was about $20."}
{"text":"Needing a quick place to grab a bite after picking up my friend from the airport, we walked into \"That's a Wrap\" where the owner warmly greeted us. I was immediately impressed by the atmosphere, (seat cushions, tasteful music not too loud, and funky menus). It took us both a while to decide on what to order b/c everything looked so good! I got the Ken and Barbie-Que, and my friend ordered Alota Fajita. We were both blown away! I loved that the sides with the sandwiches were something other than bagged chips you picked out- fresh chips and salsa, pasta salad, soup, or fruit sala.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Cool place, just wish I had been coming here more often.      It's in an old house so it has that cool \"old school downtown\" vibe about it.   Pretty healthy menu items with funny names that you'll be sure to remember, like Cheech and Dijon Chicken, The Very Brady Clubster,Teriyaki 90210, Gringo Star, In Like Fin, Rocky VII, The Veggie Jackson, and Bird Is The Word , just to name a few.  I had the Prince of Thai which I really enjoyed. Just spicy enough for my tastes. I tried the pasta salad as a side and was impressed that it wasn't oily or had too much useless stuff on it, simple is good.  At $6.95 I thought it was a heck of a lot better than a drive through or a sub sandwich.  I'll be back soon to try one of everything on their menu!"}
{"text":"Super cool little urban lunch spot, outdoor patio seating is ideal for AZ spring time.  one little word of caution... at the north entrance obey the watch your step sign... I didn't and I ate it big time, that being said, the food was so good it made me forget all about my fall.  I recommend the route 66 wrap (amazing)."}
{"text":"Made the trek over to That's a Wrap from my Tempe office for lunch today.  Even though it honestly doesn't take that long it was well worth it.   I went with a buddy who has actually had them cater a luncheon for a client which also went very well. Today I ordered the \"Birds the Word\". The chicken was moist, flavorful and fresh. In addition since it wasn't filled with rice it was the right amount of food. Compliment that with a fresh side of fruit, I had a winner!   My buddy got the Cypress salad. Not only was the salad the size of my head but it looked very fresh and he mentioned it had good flavor.  In total for both of us it was around $20 including drinks. A great go to spot in the valley!"}
{"text":"I love That's a Wrap!!!! The ingredients are fresh, the staff  is friendly, and he atmosphere is like nowhere else. Unfortunately, I think this place gets a little busy and can't handle the volume of customers that roll through for the lunch hour. However,t eh food is so good that I won't let this knock a star.   Overall, best wraps in the valley--hands down,"}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, but busy at lunch time and small parking lot.  FOOD I've been here many times and it's always been fresh and made how I like it.  The wraps are good size for their price and I never walk away hungry. There are some vegetarian chioces and really yummy tea to drink (other drinks available).   ENVIRONMENT Small main dining area with high tops and regular tables. Sometimes noisy and a little cramped. Unique decor with one of a kind artwork on the walls. Outdoor seating overlooking the parking lot.   OTHER If you come at lunch time 11:45-1:00pm, good luck with parking."}
{"text":"Oh, That's a Wrap, how I love you.   2002, my brother lived in Coronado before it was trendy to live there, and it was still somewhat frightening. He is kind of a granola type, and took me to That's a Wrap for lunch one day. It was absolutely fantastic. Healthy, clean, something for everyone, and high quality. Flash forward 8 years and the owner sells it to the manager and they move uptown. It's actually better than it ever was.  Now, TAW has a patio... a really awesome patio. They have the same menu with the same food, and now stock beer and wine. They didn't fuck that up either, as they are carrying Oskar Blues beers. If you don't want to drink, you can have a big cup of China Mist iced tea... unfamilar with China Mist? They are a local company who does phenomenal flavored (and thankfully unsweetened) iced teas. Good job TAW, get a beer and wine license and a patio, and you make me really happy.   Now, as if all of that wasn't enough, the lady who manages it is so frickin nice it's crazy. She has a very cool attitude and is extremely helpful.   If you're visiting for the first time, try the Prince of Thai's, Buffalo 66, or Godfather wraps, they are all great."}
{"text":"Very yummy place to grab lunch! It's very laid back and the service was really good. Definitely nice to have a quick and healthy option out there."}
{"text":"I like this place for lunch. It is relativley inexpensive, and healthy as you can get a wrap and side (choice of soup, pasta salad, or fruit) for about $7. Everything there seems fresh, they have quick service and a unique dinning and patio area. My favorite wrap is the buffalo chicken and I would reccomend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Wowsers! Thank you, Yelp, for a good find!  I just purchased a new car down the street and was heading there to drop off the title on my old car. Not having done grocery shopping for the week I knew grabbing something on the way home would be in order. So I pull up my Yelp app, plug in the zip code and look at some reviews. Wraps, rice bowls and salads? Sounds healthy... I could go for that! So I perused the menu online, decided on something to pick up for myself and my boyfriend and set out after finishing at the dealer.  Immediately I was struck by how QUAINT the outside looked. It reminded me of something I would see in Austin (where I moved from a couple years back). Inside the decor is white, minimal, clean and charming. And WHOA! Cider and wine in the cooler? Yesssss.... I definitely felt at home here. I made my order to go, made some small talk with one of the employees and sat for maybe 5 minutes tops for my food and headed home.  The veggie rice bowl was SO GOOD. I wasn't sure what to expect but there's a whole lot of flavor going on in there, a perfect amount of spice, and NO skimping on the veggies. The portion was just right. I felt full but not agonizingly so.  My only complaint was that the side order of pasta salad was really small. As in the \"why bother?\" sort of way. I'm willing to look over that though as my boyfriend said it was tasty.  If I'm ever in that neighborhood again I wouldn't hesitate to go back again for SURE. A happy discovery!"}
{"text":"My only regret with this place is that I worked neaby for years without knowing it was there!  I'm a vegetarian and I love the variety with the wraps, the soup and the sides.  I've tried many different wraps and each one was great!"}
{"text":"Soursdey ya'll!  I've been coming here for quite some time now, prior to it being located at the new Camelback location. I gotta say, same great food. As you can see by the name, the specialty are wraps ranging from some tasty and healthy cold/hot meat wraps to veggie. My personal favorite is the Rocky VII which is a juicy saute of either steak or chicken - I love the steak BTW, with mushrooms, onions, various peppers, provolone in a wheat tortilla. Complementing your wrap of choice is a pasta or fruit salad or the soup of the day. The pasta salad is another reason I come here! A salad with the right mix of freshness and tanginess. Very good. A small quaint place. Seating inside and outside. It's a little tough to get out of the parking lot being on Camelback during weekday lunch hours, but worth the wait. Service always comes with a smile, the food is delish, and That's a Wrap!"}
{"text":"Do they have the best wrap I've ever eaten? No. Do they serve fun and interesting combinations that you can't get anywhere else? Yes. So I will continue to eat here and be a fan. Sometimes the wraps are a little half-assed but they always taste good and that's what counts. They had a special wrap called 'District Ate' with chicken, apricots, almonds, lettuce, and other yummy things. I ordered the Very Brady Clubster instead. It was good but I'm still thinking about that damn special. It is a great place to go and try something new. Also, their iced tea is outta this world.   I always make sure to go after the lunch rush. If you don't like crowds and a nightmare worthy parking situation then just avoid it and go later. Yummy, fresh, and healthy food is always worth a little extra."}
{"text":"Fresh. Convenient. Cheap. And I'm not talking about me as a date. It's That's A Wrap! Or It's A Wrap. Or Wraps N Things. Not sure, but me likey! I've only had one thing and it was the turkey wrap with cream cheese and strawberry preserves in a whole wheat tortilla. Dee lish! Side pasta dish was, well, your basic cold side pasta dish. The day we were there, the room was luke warm at best. No A/C! Almost made me want to run for the hills. But we got it to go and enjoyed it at home. Besides the customers who were there were stinky teenagers with pants hanging at their knees, bad posture and sad, sulky little faces. Oh, puberty!"}
{"text":"All in the rapper, E-40's voice:  Dopeness n shiat.. all wrapped up in a quaint little package. I ordered me a Thai Wrap after reading all the hype on this damned inter web, and that thang was the bizness. Had a n*gg* lickin peanut flavor off my phalanges for realz mane. Garlic rice make a thugg feel nice. Replaced that chicken with mothafunkin sauteed tofu and felt real good about myself afterward for not eating dead aminals. Too bad I'm making like 4 slabs of baby back ribs thizz weekend. Funk dem animals mane.. I be eatin them shits on the weekend only. Lots of em too.   My side salad came in a tiny ass condiment container! Aye, That's a Wrap!! Quit skiggety skimpin on dem portions mane.   Homie who took my order showed respek like a mugg... You wanna meet up fer lunch some time Yelpers?? Just Tell Me When To Go-  Hocus Pocus"}
{"text":"Vegheads and carnivores alike, rejoice! Even though just about every item on the menu comes with some variety of meat, they can all be substituted with grilled tofu. Even though there's only one standard vegetarian wrap available (the Veggie Jackson).... it' delicious. Plus, the combination of feta, garlic rice, and heaps of spicy veggies wrapped in a spinach tortilla make for a really filling meatless meal.   And, if wraps aren't for you, fear not! The bowls are awesome, especially the teriyaki and bangkok (and the carrot cake looked pretty damn good, too... eh, to hell with lunch food)."}
{"text":"Love That's a Wrap! It's the perfect local lunch spot. Quick, easy, healthy, fresh wraps, salads and yummy sides at the right price! I'm really sad they moved locations because its a bit of a trek from work now but I still make the drive. I love too many wraps to list but absolutely worth trying."}
{"text":"That's a wrap is the perfect lunch spot for health conscience people. But don't worry -- its not bland and borning. The food is tasty, the service is quick, its easy but also a nice, cute spot for conversation and relaxing mid-workday. Parking can be a bit of a challenge, but never takes too long to find a spot, so be patient. The salads and wraps are all great and suprisingly generous portions."}
{"text":"I had to take a star away.  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken rice bowl and was very disappointed, it tasted really strange and really soggy.  My co-worker said it best, he said it tasted like a frozen meal heated.   I'll stick with the 5 star wraps and salads and leave the 2.5 star bowls for them to keep."}
{"text":"I've been a patron since the old location and now I'm happy that they are closer to me. My favorite sandwich is the Buffalo wrap. Ask for hunks of blue cheese if you get it. I'm from Buffalo, and I can tell they use Frank's.  My only complaint is the tiny portion of the side salad you get. I don't know of any other place that has such a small side. They staff is very friendly and a lot of fun. They also have a punchcard, so you get a free sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up some lunch today, and I went with the veggie jackson. i ordered it sans eggplant, so it came with broccoli, asparagus tops, carrots, onions, feta cheese, garlic rice and a balsalmic salsa. It was exactly what my tummy was hoping for. :) I opted for the tortilla chips and salsa today instead of the miso soup (which is delicious), and was happy with my choice. the salsa is chunky, with lots of veggies and flavor. The place was pretty empty, so it didn't take long for my food to come up. Quick, affordable and delicious!"}
{"text":"That's a Wrap is one of my all-time favorite lunch-time spots! If you like wraps and haven't eaten at That's a Wrap yet, you need to do so immediately! Their menu is fantastic, with tons of delicious, quirky-named delights. And it's great for vegetarians, because all of the meat can be swapped out for grilled tofu. So far, I've had the Buffalo 66, the Seniorita No-Meata, the Veggie Jackson and the Bird is the Word. They've all been so good that when I go in now, I make a couple of suggestions as to which wraps I like, and then ask them to surprise me with their own choice. Hasn't failed me yet! And seriously, their pasta salad is AMAZING! The chips and salsa are also quite delicious, but you can never go wrong with their pasta salad. And no meal at That's a Wrap is complete without a cold glass of the berry lemonade. Mmmm.... this is all making me hungry!"}
{"text":"I would have never know that That's A Wrap existed if one of my coworkers hadn't known about it and suggested lunch there after a press conference at the capital.    It's seemingly a little shack, but inside it's very clean (aesthetically to the eye and physically).  A great place to grab lunch, their menu includes wraps, salads, rice bowls, and smoothies.    All of the menu items are quirk-ily named which adds kitschy-ness and sometimes a conversation topic to a lunch out.  The wraps are VERY filling and the sides are small.  Sometimes I wish I could have more side and less wrap, but I'm never hungry after eating the meal.  Writing this review is making me hungry..."}
{"text":"I order the Buffalo 66, The Veggie Jackson and the Señorita no meata, all very delicious. I've had the Prince of Thai and it was good but I think I expected a bit more. The Gringo Star was bland and nothing I'd ever order again. If you are in the mood for a Mexican burrito, go to a Mexican joint - otherwise if you want a delicious wrap, go with another selection from the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I came here at 1 p.m. for lunch. I figured if I leaned on the late side to eat, I'd find a parking spot. Sure enough. Word to the wise: Late lunch here = good idea, indeed.   I entered through the back, where the outside patio is, and walked right up to the counter to order. On the wall hung a big blackboard. I read it, half-confused, expecting more than just one wrap offered. I panicked for a half-second, since I was hungry for the Who's the Turkey, thanks to Sarah G's review.   The friendly guy behind the counter must have read my expression. He handed me a freshly printed menu. Brand new, he said; they debuted yesterday. Ah-ha. \"I've never been here,\" I admitted shyly. I looked back up at the board on the wall. \"Ah, that must be the special...\" I said half to myself and half to him. \"If only I could read vertical.\" He laughed. On the board in chalk was this word:  S P E C I A L  I ordered the Who's the Turkey, without onions, with a side of fruit. For there. All for $7.50. Nice. I grabbed the Styrofoam cup handed to me and walked over to their \"drink station\" to get water and ice. I then took a seat near the counter. Plenty of spots to chose from. The place was half-full. Very cool. I picked up a couple free mags to peruse: Java and Urban Affair. Right on. Then I noticed them: stacks and stacks of Styrofoam cups. Weird. I figured a place like this wouldn't want to harm the environment. They even have a recycle-only bin near the trash. I was perplexed... and disappointed. I hate Styrofoam. For that alone, this place gets docked a single star. (I don't want to feel like I'm harming Mother Earth if I stop to eat here. I may bring in my own bottled water next time.)  My food arrived after a short wait. Beautiful. The fresh fruit came in a mini-cup (made of Styrofoam, of course) and was filled with red grapes, orange slices, pineapple wedges, strawberries and the best cantaloupe I think I've ever had.   The wrap was divine, too. I nibbled happily in my chair, so thrilled that I took a break from the office to get lunch here. I had almost changed my mind, but I'm SO glad I didn't. If I lived nearby or worked closer, I'd come here often. Like 3x a week often. I'd coerce friends and co-workers to come with me. It'd be a That's a Wrap Rally, indeed.   Nix the Styrofoam, won'tcha? Everything else gets an A+ from me."}
{"text":"Tasty place!  Fresh dishes with combinations that are delicious and healthy.  Decor is fun, hippy chic.  Parking is definitely their weakest link, but the yummy food and casual atmosphere makes up for it."}
{"text":"Tasty independent veggie friendly lunch spot close to downtown.  Very impressive list of wraps.  Fresh soup prepared daily.  The only ticks against it are that parking can be a problem and it takes a long time for them to prepare the food around the lunch hour. My tip - call your order in and pick it up."}
