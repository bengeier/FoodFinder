{"text":"Just came back from dinner with my wife at Maroli, and we both enjoyed it immensely. Not a deep menu, but very good food, fresh, well-prepared, home-made chutneys, and attractive presentation in an updated dining room. Friendly, efficient staff. Most of the clientele appeared to be from the Indian sub-continent, and seemed very happy to be there."}
{"text":"After seeing Maroli featured on a Food Network show, I had to try the butter chicken. Am I ever glad I did! This dish lives up to the hype as truly being one of my absolutely favorite butter chicken dishes in the city.   I've eaten in, but have since opted for take out (its a bit out of my way). I loved that we could bring our own wine Maroli. I would say that I almost missed it the first time I tried to find it. It has a very \"unassuming\" front facing presence. The location is quaint, clean with prompt service.   I rarely stray from my tried and true butter chicken selection, however, I've recently also tried the following:   - Veggie & Beef Samosas - hot, crispy and hot too oily. Both have a great spicy kick to them, and the chutney that comes along with them is a perfect combination!  - Butter Paneer - same delicious tomato gravy as used with the chicken, a veggie friendly option if needed. I'll stick to the chicken.  - Palak Paneer - blended smooth spinach and cheese dish. My preference is to often have a bit more texture with this dish, but no complaints. Still a tasty, enjoyed addition to any of my ordered meal  - Maroli Special Naan - a must order. It is basically naan on overdrive - spice, garlic and so beautifully put together. I can eat this alone... no dipping even required!   - Rice offering - with peas (need to get some extra vegetables in there, right?!)  Their butter chicken is so good, I feel no need to deviate from my classic, tried and true order. The pricing is well on point, and when opting for home delivery - it comes, hot, fast and well packed.   Truly a gem."}
{"text":"First - this place offers food from the Kerala region in Indian. If you love Indian food and want to try something else other than butter chicken and naan, eat here.  I grew up in South India and have travelled all over the Malabar coast so I know this area and the food pretty well. That being said - Maroli comes close to the style of food offered in that region. This is where I come to when I want appam, fish or shrimp curries. Also their famous Malabar chicken is quite good - meat is always cooked well (not dry) and flavored with a myriad of spices.   Step outside the generic Indian food that is offered in Toronto and try Maroli."}
{"text":"The place looks clean when you first walk in, but when you sit down... The light switches are black and overall not kept up. The door to the kitchen is black as well. Does no one wash their hands? The cook came out of the back restaurant to go outside and he looked filthy... Like he didn't shower in a week and his clothes were very dirty and not washed. We left. If the restaurant doesn't maintain cleanliness in the front... I don't want to know the condition of the kitchen at the back. I'm sure the food tastes fine. But I think with today's restaurant standards the place should have good food and a maintained restaurant where I don't have to doubt how the food is handled."}
{"text":"Solid Kerala food. Get the Malabar specialties."}
{"text":"They're Malabar chicken is really good. The butter chicken is alright"}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in town. Family style dishes ; the butter chicken was incredible and the Maroli Naan, was iinmatched. Highly recommended ."}
{"text":"I went to Maroli on Bloor St. West back in April and am just now getting around to writing this review!  I really enjoy Maroli and have stopped in more than once since.  I first noticed Maroli's flashy advertising, which openly mocks the KFC a few doors down (the strategy being the contrast between their delicious Malabar Chicken and the Colonel's \"bland\" variety). I had also been somewhat desperately handed fliers on my walk home every day, advertising the weekly special on the Malabar Chicken.  Take a guess what I ordered?  Who says advertising doesn't work?  The Malabar Chicken doesn't really come with much, I ordered an extra side of Malabari roti.  The waitress was very concerned that this would be too dry and asked me if I wanted a side dish (I think she offered lentils).  I told her no, I thought it would be fine, and we bantered back and forth about how spicy the chicken was.  I sat back and waited in the near-empty restaurant and read a book of spices they had at the front.  When the food came, I was not disappointed.  A hearty serving of rice with the deep red boneless chicken pieces, crispy fried and coated in spice.  There were a few meek raw veggies underneath but they seemed to serve as garnish more than anything.  The bread was chewy, warm and pleasantly oily, a nice (though yes, dry) contrast to the juicy chicken chunks.  The waitress underestimated my tolerance for spice and I vowed to get it \"really spicy\" next time.  She laughed and said it's hard to gauge what people think spicy is.  Overall the food was good and the ambience decent.  The wait was long but the food was obviously fresh cooked and therefore worth the wait.  I noticed happily that the place is licensed, although I did not indulge on that visit.  I vaguely recall some mixup with my order but it was sorted out pleasantly and obviously wasn't worth jotting down in my notes.  I paid with a card but I can't recall if it was debit or credit. The atmosphere is relaxed so it would be a nice casual place to take friends.  Most entrees are between $8 - $12."}
{"text":"Holy cow! Was this place ever a treat! A friend dragged my hungry ass here between Fringe shows this past Friday. I wasn't expecting much and I was very pleasantly surprised.   It's a hole in the wall, to be sure. But the food was spectacular and the chef (or at least a very personable fella wearing a chef's jacket) took the time to explain each and every step involved in making parantha, which left us feeling like he actually knew a thing or two about cooking.   We ordered rice and bread along with four dishes to share: the egg curry, the beef Syrian, the chana massala, and the kadai vegetables. All of them were tasty. The egg curry and the kadai veg were particularly spicy and delicious. The beef was a tich on the dry side. Still yummy, but could have been better.  The beer selection was bottle of bland blonde beer, bottle of bland blonde beer, bottle of bland blonde beer or bottle of creemore. Underwhelming, to be sure, but I'd been aching for a beer since about ten minutes before we got in line for the last fringe show, so the fact that they were all served cold and with a clean glass was more than enough for me.   The room was small, cozy and quirky, which was comfortable enough until the family of ten with the screaming children sat behind us. From then on the room seemed cramped, disorganized, and loud. Not really the fault of the restaurant, but definitely impacted my dining experience.   The food was so great, though, that I'll find any excuse I can to go back."}
{"text":"I found the food quite good. The Vegetable Biryani was especially nice with lots of vegetables and not too much oil. I got take out, but I would go back and eat there. The staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for Maroli, and I was very disappointed.  I ordered the Aloo Gobi, the peas pulao, and the vegetable pakoras.  The pakoras were just okay.  They weren't very hot when they were served.  The tamarind sauce they came with was delicious, but the pakoras themselves were kind of bland.  The aloo gobi, which is one of my favorite dishes, was oily and bland.  The vegetables were overcooked and under seasoned.  There were large puddles of oil left behind in the dish afterwards.  Again, the dish wasn't served very hot.  The peas pulao were similarly lukewarm.  Some of the peas were dried out.   The service was similarly lacklustre.  Our waiter wasn't particularly friendly.  Not rude, either, just not friendly.  Overall, I left with a resounding sense of meh. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I came here with a groupon voucher with a friend. I was excited to try some of the chicken, since I've never had Malabar chicken, but they were celebrating some sort of food festival at the time (for two days). I happened to come by during that festival, and their regular menu was unavailable.   The food was passable. Maybe it wasn't as good to me because I really wanted to try that chicken. I wouldn't order it again though.  The mango lassi wasn't very good either. The waiter serving us made it sound like a mango smoothie, but it was too sour to be considered that. That was a major let down too, but perhaps that's just what a lassi is (I don't know, I've never had it before that). All I know is I won't be ordering that again, here or at any other restaurant."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place after hearing some really good reviews from my South Indian friends. I belong from a Malayali family myself and was craving malayali food for a while. So finally decided to visit this place with my parents.   Location and Ambience - Not bad..we were the only guests in the restaurant. This was in a way good for us as we got the seat right by the open window.  Food - We ordered Chilly eggplant, Malabari Chicken, Meen polichathu and Mixed veg curry. Out of these four only Malabari chicken was worth the money. Meen polichathu was overpriced and quite hard. (We had heard that this was one of their specials and a definitely go-for item so we ordered it right away althought it was priced $20 and the size of the fish was quite small and it didn't taste anywhere close to what you would usually get in Kerala). Chilly eggplant had lots and lots of oil and the mixed veg curry was okay.  For breads, we had ordered Malabari roti (again they were quite small in size and not as half as good as what you usually get in Kerala). We ordered wheat chapathi and Garlic, butter and plain Naan bread. Most of the Naan bread we got was way too hard and felt like it was overcooked (burnt to be precise) which we reported and they replaced with another set of Naan which was slightly better than the first one but had the same issue. Moreover the Naan didn't freel fresh and felt like they had just heated up the Frozen chapatis/Naan and served it to us.  Service - Out server was really nice and pleasant in terms of interaction. However, we had to wait close to one hour to get our food that we had ordered.  All in all not a pleasant experience. Will never visit again."}
{"text":"It's saving grace was the 10% off  Yelp check in offer and the Malabar chicken we came to try, tasted liked some spicy curry coated deep fried chicken fingers. Heart palpitating yum!   It was eerily empty that night which was not a good sign. And yeah the flies. Oh well."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was very good. We had a hard time making a selection because there were too many great options. A definite recommendation."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. The hapless kid waiting on us seemed like he was filling in for someone who had ducked out to the washroom -- he didn't seem to have any experience with or interest in waiting tables, and seemed either stoned or distracted. Our food took forever to come out, and when it did it was almost comically bad -- the vegetables had clearly come out of a bag of frozen mixed veggies, with some bland sauce half-heartedly sloshed over them after defrosting. The chicken dish we ordered was passable, but small and unremarkable for the price. Toronto is full of great Indian restaurants -- steer clear of this one."}
{"text":"Découvert un peu par hasard, ce restaurant de tradition malabaraise est très sympathique. Tous les mets ne se valent pas, le Paneer n'est pas le meilleur, mais le Buf est bien relevé. Le poulet parfaitement épicé sans être trop salé, le riz parfaitement aromatisé sans être écurant. Une petite découverte dans ce quartier coréen ! Et si vous ne mangez que le Halal, et bien vous serez servi, c'est le cas de toutes les viandes."}
{"text":"As a Malayali, I can't really argue with the authenticity of the food. It was like eating at a Kerala restaurant in lovely Thrissur, Kerala. The Malabar chicken was quite good but surprise surprise my Canadian friend LOVED the butter chicken. The servings were a good size and all the dishes were overall tasty!!   Keep up the good work Maroli."}
{"text":"I'm surprised a lot of inferior Indian restaurants in Toronto have a higher rating on Yelp. Maroli specializes in Malabari (Kerala, southern Indian state - north and south Indian food tastes very different)  cuisine, so even though they make a decent butter chicken and saag paneer, I would recommend you try something else.  I usually get the Chicken chettinad (not on menu - ask the owner about it, it's amazing), the lamb stew and the fish vatichatthu (fish wrapped in a banana leaf with spices). The naan substitute is called 'appam' - also called hoppers (crispy rice cake with a soft centre). This should be good for 4 people to share. Though the appams are not as good as the ones you get in Kerala (duh, I guess) they're still pretty decent.  AVOID the naan and paranthas as they taste like they come out of a frozen packet. My experiments with the menu have not worked out always so I usually stick to the above choices. I haven't been to Aravinds (in Greek town) but this is definitely my fave South-Indian food in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Amazing fish vattichattu, beef samosas, fried chicken and everything else. I order delivery so never been to the restaurant, but always friendly service."}
{"text":"Food is good but the two times we ordered, there were issues with delivery. Tonight was a joke- it didn't arrive after over 90 minutes. After lots of calls between restaurant and eventually driver, it seemed restaurant lied about when they have the Just eat driver the food. Manager then said the food was free and they would deliver asap- however when we called the driver again after ten minutes, he said they called him and said to bring food back to them. Absolute joke."}
{"text":"Tried this place with the husband since we were craving south-indian food.   We had the following: Meen Polichathu: The masala was great but the fish used was not pomfret. But still tasted great.  Appam: Soft but not sweet enough  Beef Syrian: Good masala but the beef was over-cooked  Malabar mutton Stew: Poorly seasoned, will not be trying that again  Malabari Roti: Good but not the same as the original, this one is a little crispy and not soft.  Over all the ambience is ok, the service is good and if you are craving Malabar cuisine and don't want to go all the way to Brampton or Mississauga, this will do."}
{"text":"A charming little place that serves Indian food, predominantly from the state of Kerala (in the south of India) although they do have some northern dishes too.  I've always wanted to try food from Kerala and so dinner here was quite the treat for me.  When I first opened the menu, I was a little dismayed to see how high the prices were.  It's not that they were overly outrageous or anything but they were definitely higher than I had anticipated.  But when I received my food, I could see that the portions were plentiful and thus, there would be a lot of leftovers (or enough for 2 people).  I tried their pakora (bit plate full!) which came with a vindaloo sauce rather than tamarind chutney.  The pakoras were beautifully fried and the vindaloo sauce had quite a bit of kick to it.  For my main course, I tried their beef syrian, mixed vegetables and rice.  The beef syrian was definitely quite a bit different from any other Indian meat dish I've tried as the spices were a bit different from any North Indian dishes I've tried and it had a distinct coconut taste to it.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and the meat was nicely moist.  The vegetables were amazingly fresh and surprisingly not too mushy.   Service was pleasant and efficient which is something I appreciate.  A nice change of pace from the regular Indian fare."}
{"text":"Its been a while since Ive been on Yelp.  i used to live in San Francisco (and worked a couple of blocks from the Yelp HQ), but for the longest time they didnt have Yelp in TO.  Now that they do, I couldnt think of a better place to start my re-reviewing than Maroli.  To start with I just wanted to say that I had this food delivered to us, so I cant really speak to the restaurant's decor or service.  I will say that since I had mentioned that this was a special going away dinner for my friend, the owner called me up personally the next day to ask how it was, and I was amazed by this simple gesture.   The food was great overall, with a slightly different menu from your standard North Indian fare.  They do have butter chicken, but they also have fish moilee, and other coconut based dishes, which are typical of southern Indian cooking.   What we had: Channa Masala, Kadai Vegetables, Dal Fry, Mutton Biryani, Butter Chicken( I had to), Fish Moilee, Malabari Roti, and Appam  For those of you expecting naan, this is not your type of place.  The rotis here are completely different in texture and taste, and I personally like that.  Also, for a taste of something totally southern, I would recommend the rice flour based \"bread\" called Appam. The thing I liked most about Marolis food, besides the flavors, was that it wasnt greasy.  Many of the Indian restaurants that I have ordered from in the past tend to have more grease than curry in their dishes(and I mean you Biryani House), and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the containers that the food came in were not soaked through with grease. I give the food 3 1/2 stars and a 1/2 bonus for attention to detail and service."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the new location on Bloor Street since the restaurant relocated from the hidden-away spot they used to occupy in a laneway just south of Davisville, near Yonge.  However, I am looking forward to getting another serving of their heavenly Chicken Tikka Masala.  I've never had better, and if you ask for it spicy, it will both warm you and delight you with the perfect blend of flavours."}
{"text":"The mutter paneer here is awesome ! no where else in toronto  ifound orange colored curry that's savory a little sweet and has a spicy kick, you can always ask for mild it is so nice how this is so creamy"}
{"text":"Really, really, really disappointed by this place.   For a place that is to have some of the best butter chicken in Toronto, it was a great let down. The butter chicken was okay. Not even that good, just okay. They use large chunks of white meat. The meat is very dry and bland.   The roti tastes very similar to Irish potato cake, not roti. The beef chili was horrid. We didn't even eat it. The basmati rice, nothing special. I could have made better at home.   The best thing was actually the pakoras. Very fresh and not greasy at all.   If you are in Little Korea and are craving Indian (odd location for this place, btw), pop in. You can get a lot of food for the price. I just found the food was really lacking in flavour and complexity."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, reliable, courteous, polite service Only ordered delivery, but always had every dish be above expectations. This is my absolute favourite for Indian, and my favourite delivery. Malabar chicken is spectacular and flavourful, but the salad with it desultory. Vegetable korma delicious, naan fantastic -- strong recommend"}
{"text":"My family and I used to frequent this place, though we stopped because of the temporary closure, and haven't tried it since. However, I have some very fond memories of its Malabar chicken, in particular.  Location and Size: While I haven't been inside (we tend to order delivery or pick-up), I've been told it's got a nice sit-down ambiance, though it's nothing too fancy. Maroli is near Bathurst Station, which was close to me back when we frequently ordered there. They have a relatively large free delivery area, and an even broader three-dollar delivery area (extending all the way down to the Harbourfront, in fact).  Staff: While I, again, haven't visited, the staff almost always pick up the phone (though this may seem pretty elementary, some places - like Sukho Thai - rarely retrieve calls), and are accommodating (we, for example, occasionally ask for some online-only discounts to be applied via phone, and because we're regulars, they oblige).   Prices: I wouldn't call this food inexpensive (nearby Sizzler Kebab, for example, serves similar dishes for far less). However, it's reasonably priced, in my books: we can get enough (if not too much) food for two for approximately $45.00, including tax. Make sure that you take advantage of promo codes, and ask for new, unlisted ones! They often make all the difference.   Food: To date, we've tried the following here: tandoori chicken wings, tandoori chicken tikka, Maroli salad, vegetable pakora (which was once offered as a free appetizer, courtesy , Malabar chicken, chicken tikka masala, chicken karahi, butter chicken, chilly chicken, chilly chicken wrap, channa masala, Malabar chicken biryani, and assorted naan (i.e., plain, special, and garlic). The food does vary depending on the cook, but it is consistently hot upon delivery (another basic requisite that other places do not always fulfill), seemingly fresh, and considerably flavorful. Despite the fact that I'm not particularly well-versed in Kerala cuisine (nor, in fact, in Indian cuisine as a whole), I can safely say that this dramatically out-does some other downtown restaurants - it's not terribly oily, and has some unique flavors to its name (I haven't, for example, seen Malabar biryani and Malabar chicken elsewhere, as much). While this is, of course, subjective, our favorites include the chilly chicken (a Hakka-style specialty featuring a semi-sweet, spicy sauce with melt-in-your-mouth chicken pieces and chunky green peppers that, apparently, is very popular), Malabar chicken (meticulously seasoned fried chicken - great on some occasions, but variable on others: haven't always received the best cuts of meat with this one, and it can get a bit dry), and the tandoori chicken wings (their seasoning, again, varies, but they're consistently smokey, well-seasoned, and juicy). I love a side of Maroli salad (just carrots, cabbage, red onions, and green peppers, julienned and whisked together with a little lemon, salt, and pepper), and the special naan is pretty interesting, too (cheese, chillies, cilantro, and garlic... quite the killer combo, haha, though I'm not sure how authentic it is).  Additional Notes:  1) The meat here is halal! That's wonderful, as some of my family members only eat halal. 2) Take advantage of their Facebook sign-in and e-mail features to get Maroli Bucks (i.e., money you can spend at Maroli, after it accumulates to a decent quantity - not particularly worth it) and discount notifications (considerably more compelling - they frequently have assorted promo codes you can utilize). 3) On Fridays and Saturdays, chilly chicken is discounted from $11.99 to $10.99! 4) Make sure to order online so that you can take advantage of first-time-buyer discounts and other promotional offers! These do not apply via phone! 5) They're closed on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I came to Maroli with a friend of mine after the place we had wanted to go was closed. It ended up being one of the best meals I've had in a while. This place first caught my attention with its snarky signs directed towards a neighboring KFC. I had certainly given KFC enough tries, I might as well try this I thought.   I tried the Malabar chicken, which the menu claims is their specialty and my friend had the butter chicken. The Malabar chicken was bright red, spicy, and crispy pieces of chicken served with a sauce similar to Sriracha sauce. It was the perfect level of spiciness and was very flavorful. My friend claimed that his meal was the best butter chicken he'd ever had.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was comfortable and pleasant and our waiter was nice and thankfully attentive with water refills. All in all a great place with some of the most flavorful Indian food I've had."}
{"text":"Went to there Malabar Food Festival a few years ago and was blown away. It was a huge buffet for $25 and I had never tasted Indian food like it before. I was super impressed.  Went again for lunch a year later and a few weeks ago, I used a groupon I had purchased a few months ago that was going to expire.  Food: Indian Food from the province of Karali. Someone knows what they are doing in the kitchen in regards to spice. Atmosphere: not much Service: Friendly and efficient.  I noticed they are no longer open for lunch. I asked why and he replied \"not enough business\". I truly hope these guys survive."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service.  We were really excited about the restaurant as it is from the south of India and not one of the run of the mill type Indian restaurant. I must say that most of the food was quite authentic. The fried fish we ordered which was the most expensive dish on the menu was kind of rubbery which is a sigh that it's been in and out of the freezer and is not fresh. That was the first negative. Then the service was really terrible, we felt bad for the server as she was the only one there but she didn't even do the basics for a restaurant. She got the dishes one at a time and did not bring all the rotis in one go so we had to wait in between our meal for the rotis to continue which was really annoying. The wait for the food was long but it wouldn't have been as bad if it was all brought out together. Overall I wouldn't go back nor would I recommend it."}
{"text":"More so than the Food, there was a consistent image in my mind 'til now. From Meal start-to-finish, I was hoping to see that image dissipate. It never went away and this simply proves one simple THEORY...  Treat each Customer as if they were your last(or as Family). By no means were we not properly served, just the service lacked Enthusiasm. Lacked warmth, welcome, all those connections to make it complete.  Originally I thought to face-off the Malabar Chicken to Southern Fried Chicken. After a quick observation of texture and flavour components, it's not reasonable. I will rather compare it to another Indian style Chicken dish instead{1}.

{"text":"Maroli was one of my first times at a sit-down Indian restaurant, so keep in mind that this review is written from the perspective of the inexperienced. We ordered butter chicken and a few types of biryani. The taste was outstanding, with each bite a burst of flavour. Service was prompt and polite. The price is a bit higher than some other places; that is not to say that it is at all expensive, it's just that many other Indian places have rock bottom prices. I'd say Maroli is worth the small premium. I'm definitely coming back here again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"By far, this place has the best butter chicken that I've ever had. The best rated in Toronto award is deserving.   I used to come here a lot whenever I needed my fix for Indian food when I lived in the area. I haven't dined in the restaurant, but the owner has always been friendly when I waited for my take-out food. I miss this place! They do offer delivery through Orderit.ca, so I can still get this butter chicken in the Junction. However, I feel the $6.95 delivery fee is a bit excessive."}
{"text":"We walked by last week and it looked very quiet. There's a sign on the door. The restaurant is currently closed due to fire damage.  Hope they re-open soon."}
{"text":"If you are judging Indian restaurants based on their butter chicken, i'm sorry to say you are doing it wrong.  I quite liked Maroli. There are so few choices in the city for Indian food that isn't North Indian in the city, especially downtown.  Maroili serves the sort of Southern Indian food you'd find in Kerela.  They have Chapatti's and Paratha, rather than the Tandoor oven Naan's you find all over the place.  You can also get Appam, which is a rare find in the city. (I like Sri Lankan style Appam much more.) The dishes can be pretty spicy, though you can order them mild if you like. Their Malabar Chicken is pretty good, as fried chicken goes, but my friends and I all enjoyed their mussels dish the best. The stewed Beef Syrian was soft and flavourful.   The service was excellent. The staff are really friendly.  This place is definitely worth checking out if you want to try something different when it comes to Indian food."}
{"text":"I've been spending a lot of time in Toronto recently, without a a kitchen, so I've eaten out at a bunch of restaurants in the last month. This is one of only two that I've been to that I would say I would come back to.   We had the fish vattichathu and the vegetable curry dish that had a coconut milk sauce, and an order or roti and basmati rice. The fish in particular was excellent. Spicy, but flavorful. I recommend it highly.   The interior was nice, clean and upbeat, and they are open late. The wait staff was friendly and attentive, without being overbearing. They explained what would be a malabari vegetable option to us, and also recommended we switch fish dishes, which I think was the right choice. Overall a very nice experience.  The only reason I am not giving it a 5 is that it ends up being a bit on the pricey side. Meal ended up being about $40 bucks with tax and tip. I'm simply not used to paying that much for Indian food - in the US rice, and even bread, are often included and those things add up quickly.  Anyway, definitely enjoyable and I would come back again."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but I probably wouldn't come out of my way to dine here. I shared orders of the Maroli salad, Beef Syrian, palak paneer, roti, and naan bread. The server seemed really keen to make sure we ordered naan bread, which was strange since it's not one of their specialties. It was pretty oily and tasted more like Bannock, an old-fashioned style of Pioneer/native American bread.  Very heavy but not bad.  The best dish was the salad by far! The dressing definitely had coconut oil in it but the taste was really wonderful. Crunchy and fresh.  I don't normally order salad with Indian food but I'm glad I did here. The beef syrian was also good and not too dry. It had plenty of flavor and spice for my liking, but the palak paneer lacked something I usually associate with this dish. The roti was good, albeit a bit dry.  The atmosphere here is very laid-back and casual. I liked the low lighting and the decor - not too shabby at all for what some might call a \"hole in the wall\". This place really stands out in a neighborhood surrounded by Korean food, so if you're in the area, it's worth a try.  Pricing seems pretty much on par with any other Indian restaurant, but it's a lot more than the cheap Korean places nearby, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Great food, but unfortunately their service sucks. Ordered butter chicken and mutton biryani. Our mutton biryani came right away but the butter chicken came 45 minutes later because they didn't place the order in. After we reminded them about it, they came out with the wrong dish. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Everything at this place was bad.. Food, service, ambience, toilets.. I don't know how clean the kitchen is.. Considering everything else that would be dirty too.. Will never recommend this too anyone after last night.."}
{"text":"Pretty decent. Nothing amazing but good. Butter chicken is good. I got my order for take-out.  Toronto is not short of good Indian restaurants. This place is pretty good but not amazing. I'd get take-out from here again if I were in the area and needed take-out."}
{"text":"Uh, i was expecting alot more as so many great reviews and a mention on some list somewhere about them having some of THE best wings. Thought I would really wow my friends with my wing order from an indian place, gotta say, they were A-Ok but not A-MAZING! going back to try something else next time, maybe something a bit more indian"}
{"text":"We decided to come to Maroli for dinner, not because of all these 4/5 star Yelp reviews, just because Maroli promised authentic Malabari cuisine.  Don't come to eat at Maroli if you not used to fruit flies circling you or your food while you eating!! I was waving my hands non stop through out dinner trying to make them go away... No I am not crazy, it was not my imagination!  Food was OK... not bad... but nothing memorable.... like I would want to come back to eat again... since there are tons of Indian restaurants in GTA... tons and tons!!  I did request Indian spicy... not knowing that one of the Yelpers cannot handle spicy...but turned out Indian spicy is as usual not Indian spicy.. we all survived.  Usually I remember all the food I ate... but here at Maroli I don't remember much.... only the flies.... and oh the 10% first time discount if you use your Yelp App to check in.  But at least I have good companions... oh who were I eating with?! Let me think...."}
{"text":"Christmas. Two Jews. One refuses to eat Chinese (WHAT?) and every sushi place is closed or doesn't do delivery (WHAT?). So we went down the slightly less traditional route and found that Maroli delivers on Christmas. We deem this a Christmas miracle.  We ordered butter paneer and butter chicken, both of which are good. The rice was INCREDIBLE, the raita was good, and the roti tasted like Moroccan m'semen, which is good but I wish we could have ordered naan. My friend inhaled his samosas.  If this were under circumstances, I think I would have given the meal four stars because it was good (although the rice alone is worth five), but they really did save our Christmas.  The service, however, was impeccable. When I called to see if they deliver, no one picked up, but a moment later they called me back to say hello! And the woman on the phone was careful with all of the information and the delivery man was wonderfully friendly.  Thank you, Maroli!"}
