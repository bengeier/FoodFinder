{"text":"The buffet was small but I found some items which i liked. The main course was small. If I want to compare to the other restaurant the give double portion with the same price. But they don't have salad bar. They closed at 9:30 I believe its not late enough.  I had good time that night, but I never go back again. I know lots of restaurant with the same food, better price and bigger portion."}
{"text":"Shoom Shoom, you've gone way downhill.  Greasy shawarma, and very greasy falafel.  Please, don't ever reheat falafel, gross.  We havent been in about 6 months because the quality seemed to have gone down back then.  Well, now its worse."}
{"text":"This was our second time at this place. We used our groupon this time. The decor has a feel of a old diner, the staff and service were excellent.  The soup and salad bar was not large by any means. The regular $14 price tag for this seems like a rip off. The soups were quite good and the classic dips were excellent. We noticed the dessert bar section were a collection of blondies/brownies/fruits.  Our mains were lamb and chicken kebabs. These were well-seasoned and were accompanied by sides of sweet potatoes, rice and vegetables. The portions were manageable. With the groupon, our meal came to less than $20. Score."}
{"text":"Most of the items were very bland. The soup& salad bar had flies around the vegetables, I was really disgusted .   FOOD:  -Shawarma: very dry -chicken: dry and bland  -falafel: this was very hard   I would NOT return to this place ."}
{"text":"Awesome shawarma, sweet potato fries, hummus, etc.  The $15 lunch is great value - Will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been here twice for lunch now and it's such a great deal. Their chicken schnitzel is amazing and so is their tomato ______ soup. Forgot the name of it!"}
{"text":"Definitely will not be returning.  Went for a birthday tonight.  First ominous sign was the blase decor and five minute wait for a maitre'd. Service was pretty lousy.  The chicken schwarma, while it was huge, was pretty oily and definitely not good quality meat.  The hummus was decent. House salad dressing, with a basil overtone, was probably the only star the entire evening.  Otherwise, felt like I was back in my university residence days.   Unfortunate, since I'm from the neighbourhood and I really, really want a good restaurant.  Can Il Fornello open up here?"}
{"text":"A NIGHTMARE of an experience! Seated after 40 minutes..placed order with very nice waitress. 45 minutes later 3 of  4 orders came, 2 out of 4 shish kabobs (chicken) came burned to a crisp! Small scrunched up, dried out ( as though they had been cooked, not served and then recooked,and unable to be eaten. The other 2 were burned, but not as badly as the other 2. The third order contained chicken that was raw in the centre. We politely spoke to the waitress who agreed and took the order to show the owner, she agreed the 2 burned orders should be replaced, but made excuses about the raw order. The waitress told us the meat orders would be replaced and eventually were....another 1/2 hour later. By that time the 4th person we were with had finished their meal!  After requesting to seethe owner (Nicole) ourselves, it took her 10 minutes to arrive at our table.she provided us with Breakfast Buffet coupons...buy 1 get 1 free. Would you go back???? NOT ME!!! Took 15 percent off the bill and the replacement  skewers which she was going to charge us for!   BEWARE .....see you at the competition! P.s when we asked to see her again, to express disapproval with the bill Amir ( I think that was his name), the manager...lied to us. He contradicted himself 3 times about why she wouldn't come back out."}
{"text":"Shoom Shoom used to be one of my favorite restaurants. Not anymore... About a year ago I went and was turned off by all the posters around the restaurant advertising their specials. It also felt very cold. The vibe of the place has also changed, for the worse.  Recently I went for there and could not believe it, their menu has shrunk significantly. My favourite item to order was a sliced steak, it was amazing. They took it off of the menu. Their steak was also amazing, that was removed to! The only beef dish they offer is the kebab that is no better than the next restaurant.  The salad bar screams cheap!  Definitely not on my favourite restaurant anymore..."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients well prepared.  I don't think you can miss with this place.  It's good, but I don't think it's much different than Jerusalem, Me Va Me, Sababa etc.  Some dishes better, some not as good.  If you're craving Middle Eastern and you're in the area, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I know, this place isn't in downtown Toronto, so how did I even find myself here?  Well, my grandfather lives up in Thornhill, and I couldn't take him to lunch at the Centrepointe Pickle Barrel one more time without wanting to gauge my eye out with a spoon, so I had to think fast for an alternative that would suit us.  \"Us\" being my 91 year old grandfather, my sister and her 7 month old baby, and myself, a picky foodie who hates bad service and overpriced food.  Shoom Shoom is a family friendly restaurant, and has a parking lot which is great for those who can't walk far.    I liked the food I ate - I got the all-you-can-eat salad bar with chicken schwarma and it was a ton of food.  The coffee was just so-so, but the mug was gigantic and didn't need to be refilled, which is good because service was basically non-existant.  The place was nearly dead on a Friday around 1:30 p.m.    Overall, I'd go back, because really I'd rather eat any where then have to go back to the Pickle Barrel."}
{"text":"Basic dips (the baba and the hummous) are to die for, but the menu and presentation is a little schizo. Look, constantly re-inventing yourself is fine if you are Madonna but it is not an endearing quality in a restaurant, especially a neighbourhood restaurant that is trying to appeal to the same crowd over and over. When they opened, everything was a la carte and very expensive. The standing joke was that this was the home of the $10 falafel and they lost business to the cheaper and faster competitor in the same strip mall. So they re-invented themselves for a year or two as a buffet, with both hot and cold dishes at a really good price, and this, history will show, was their high point. As this is written, fall 2013, they are in their third marketing incarnation where, for about the same price you once paid for a full hot and cold buffet, you now get a cold buffet only (with soup) and you need to upgrade at extra cost for hot dishes. I dont know where they will be next year but what these people do not realize is that people actually like predictability. If I want a surprise, I'll watch something on TV"}
{"text":"Toronto has some great Middle Eastern food.  I wanted to try this place for a while.  It was pretty packed when we got there but we managed to get a table.  There were a lot of families and big groups there.  Our waitress was very nice.  We ordered humus and an eggplant salad for starters with whole wheat pita bread.  It was just ok - a bit salty and I've had better.  We shared the lamb kebab, which was amazing.  It was grilled to perfection and really tasty.   We ordered some rice with it, which had lentils and was very flavourful and enough for the two of us."}
{"text":"First customers in as usual we were greeted by a BUS BOY as plenty of seating choices here. The booths next to the open kitchen? The tables next to the floor-to-ceiling glass watching retired people shop at Longos for bread? This whole plaza has that calm slow and relaxing feel to it that makes me wish I was in retirement myself.   There are no entrances from the outside, ONLY after you enter the mall entrance can you get to the Shoom Shoom entrance. Their decor is modern enough with some colorful plates on the wall for decor. They also have a bar that looks fully loaded near the back.   The Drink menu had MOJITOS and assorted Alcoholic beverages of your choice to enjoy your afternoon. The Food menu was mostly composed of Mediterranean Cold Apps(Hummus, Baba Ghanoush), Hot Apps, Sandwiches(Falafel, Shawarma), Salads, Skewers(Beef, Chicken, Salmon).   We went for the 4 selection MIXED Platter($13.99) composed of Baba Ghanoush, Matbouha(slow cooked tomato salad with garlic, green peppers and paprika), Fried Eggplant Salad, and Tabouleh(chopped parsley, bourgul, tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, mint, coriander, lemon juice).   Favourite was the Fried EGGPLANT Salad and least was the Tabouleh. It came with some store(Longo's?) bought Pita Bread. The Waitress was helpful and very friendly as she suggested Beef Skewer when we wanted to get more items to try.   We also got the Chicken Skewer which was grilled but lacked that Mediterranean Marinade intense flavour and it was undercooked just slightly on the last piece. The Beef was perfectly cooked to a medium RARE and Beef is good and tender.  Patrons are mostly represented by LOCALS that has probably grown up on these flavours and cuisines.  A couple older ladies had some Mint Tea that looked interesting too while they enjoyed their Skewers."}
{"text":"CLOSED - sad to report this favourite place had a bailiff notice posted in the window as well as door.  Loved this place."}
{"text":"The long slide down is over. Now closed by landlord. RIP."}
{"text":"This past Sat night we had a reservation at Shoom Shoom for 7:30 and unfortunately the table was still occupied when we got there.  We had to wait until 8 to get in but  instead of leaving us with a bad impression the hostess went out of her way to apologize and make up for the unfortunate situation.  As soon as we sat down they brought us appetizers knowing we would be hungry.  The waitress came around quickly and took our orders.  A few of us wanted to try the shawarmas however they ran out.   Again they went out of their way to make up for it by giving us the remaining chicken shawarma  so we could at least try it.   The food was very good with generous portions , so much so that we all basically took our meals home as we were full from the appetizers.  This was a classic example of a staff recognizing the importance of customer service something that seems to be lacking nowadays.  Kudos to the hostess / waitress and the rest of the staff in making our experience a positive one.  Definitely would go back there again"}
{"text":"Shoom Shoom is the new northern Thornhill sister restaurant of the beloved Mashu Mashu Mediterranean Grill.  With its amazing food, great service and reasonable, like Mashu Mashu, Shoom Shoom is attracting tons of visitors and is created it's own fan base for Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food!  The menu is HUGE and offers tons of great stuff to eat for lunch, dinner, take-out and beverages.  For appetizers, I recommend the following:  - Fruity Mashu Salad, which is a bed of mixed greens with strawberries, pine nuts and goat cheese ($6.45)  - Classic Greek Salad ($6.45) - Israeli Salad ($6.45)  If you want to make a salad a full lunch or dinner served portion, just add 3 to 4 dollars extra and that's your good price for a larger set of greens!  For my main meal, I am a HUGE fan of the shish kebobs are Shoom Shoom, as well as some other items not in the kebob family.  Also, all entrees come with a choice of rice or fries for a side, along with salad!  I recommend the following:  - Chicken Kebob ($14.95) - Beef Kebob ($18.95) - Chicken Schnitzel ($14.95) - Falafel with Tahini ($5.95)   Overall, Shoom Shoom has become a HUGE HIT in the T-Hill and north part of Toronto.   Expect a bit of a wait for a table at peak meal times... but trust me, the wait is worth it!  But if you rather sit quickly, order Shoom Shoom take out! Just as amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here and used one of our 2 groupon that we had for a lunch buffet and 2 entrées. The server was friendly when we first arrived.  The buffet was ok- the dips were great and they brought bread and pita to the table. We ordered the beef and chicken kebabs. My chicken was not cooked properly and was still partially raw! we told the waiter who immediately took it back, which was great. However, he then did not come back to the table at all to let us know the status of our meal. We waited almost half an hour for another kebab! He sensed that we were upset and therefore avoided our table, which was unacceptable. Once the food arrived it was mediocre.  would not go back."}
{"text":"I came by to Shoom Shoom with two of my girl friends for someone's birthday.  The place is pretty large - looks like it used to be an old 90's breakfast joint that they just decided to change into a Middle Eastern restaurant.    My friend ordered the lamb skewer, another friend had the rainbow trout, and I had the cod filet.  Initially, we ordered some Moroccan cigars, but apparently they ran out - so they gave us garlic shrimp - on the house.  The garlic shrimp was okay, not a huge fan of it though.  My cod filet was pretty good - however, I think I would've opted for the lamb skewers instead.  It was absolutely delicious.  I would definitely recommend the zucchini soup if you had the opportunity to get it.  It was absolutely superb.  Pureed, but tasted like a cream of zucchini soup.  Dessert: we shared a fig kataif and the frozen yogurt (twisted with pomegranate and vanilla).  The fig kataif was pretty good at first, but it gets REALLY sweet at the end due to the fig reduction.   I wouldn't suggest you to eat it on your own.  Even among the three of us, it was still a bit too much.  On the other hand, the frozen yogurt was absolutely delicious.  Service was great as well.  Our server joked around with us many times throughout the night and checked up on us quite often.  Although it was more on the expensive side, I had a great experience at Shoom Shoom -- not too loud of a place to chat with your friends, and we were there until they closed - they didn't force or kick us out when they were still cleaning up."}
{"text":"This is an unique buffet of Middle Eastern cuisine.  I visited it with a Groupon coupon last Saturday.  Shoom Shoom is located on Bayview Avenue next to a Longo's.  The restaurant looks like it is used to be a diner.  The kitchen is open, so you can see how clean it is.  I am no expert in Middle Eastern food; I can say that the food is not salty.  The all-you-can-eat soup and salad bar is good and has a big selection of hummus, but it does not worth $14.  If you opt for it, it is better to add one or more main (protein) for $3/main, which comes with 2 sides.  We ordered lamb and dark chicken meat as our mains.  They were both tender.  For sides, we were impressed with the sweet potato fries; they were so crispy.  The service was slow.  The regular prices are $14/salad bar, $17/salad bar + 1 main.  It is pricey, but it has a following.  When we arrived on Saturday evening, there was a long line up.  In addition, there were a lot of people buying take outs."}
{"text":"We visited this for tonight for my birthday, as I had a taste for middle eastern food.  We had to wait for  about 30 minutes, but after being seated we could see why - it was great!  Decor is nothing special, but the food was awesome.  Baba Ghanouj was properly smokey and tangy.  Tabbouleh had a great flavour and was primarily parsley and tomato with the bulgar to add texture, rather than being used as a filler.  The lamb shish kabob with first rate - tender and delectable and served with delicious cumin scented rice interspersed with lentils.  I think we'd return on a weekday night when it might be a bit less crowded, however.  Service was very friendly and despite the crowds and the rush, the hostess was able to keep up her good humour.  A specialty cocktail called a lichee mojito was delicious and I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. I got the lentil soup and dark chicken kebob with a side of sweet potato fries. The soup was good, the kebob was disappointing and the sweet potato fries was awesome.  One of my friends got the salmon kebob and enjoyed it. My other two friends got the beef and lamb kebobs and were not pleased with it because there was not much taste to it. They also asked for the beef to be cooked medium rare and it was fully cooked.  We also got hummus as an appetizer and it was pretty good!  This restaurant is very far from where I live so I won't go back to this restaurant since it wasn't amazing in my books."}
{"text":"Great little place hidden away near John and bayview. Amazing food and friendly staff.  A bit on the pricey side for this type of food but worth it.  UPDATE:  I believe this place is now closed down"}
{"text":"I expected a lot worse for a buffet. But it's only a soup and salad buffet and everything is fresh and healthy. They have a variety of many traditional middle eastern dishes, and they all tasted great (I think it tried 60% of their offerings).  They've got it all - hummus, baba ghanoush, lentil soup, artichoke soup, great pickles, great olives,  Tried the lamb kebobs and they were cooked just right at MR, which is surprising for an Arabic restaurant."}
{"text":"Didn't feel the buffet looked like much. It looked very make shift. I ordered the beef kabob it was 3 ounces of meat.  It tasted good but just wasn't much of a portion for 14 dollars"}
{"text":"We went to Shoom Shoom for dinner last night.  Based on Melissa's review, I had high expectations and I was not disappointed.  Both the service and the food were excellent.    We ordered the Hummus appetizer to go with the complimentary pitas that were served.  It was delicious - some of the best I have ever had and the portion was huge.  In fact, all of the portions were enormous. You definitely get value for your money at this establishment!  My son had the chicken fingers with fries and the Strawberry/Blueberry smoothie and he wants me to let you know that he really enjoyed both.  The rest of us ordered the chicken shish kabob and the chicken schnitzel.  We should have ordered one portion of each and shared - we ended up taking more than half of each entree home.  The sweet potato fries came with some sweetened mayo dip and were yummy.  The schnitzel covered most of the plate and fries.  I took a picture of it it was so huge.    The shish kabob was delish.  The entrees come with a choice of sides (fries, sweet potato fries, baked potato or rice) and a side salad (which was almost the size of a full salad).  I opted to pay the extra $1.99 for the Fruity Mushu Salad and was not disappointed.  I finished every bite and was pretty much full by the time my entree arrived.    I ordered one of the house specialty drinks - the blackberry with rum, mint and soda - essentially a blackberry mojito (although you can order it with vodka too).  It was huge (and tasty) and for $5.95 a great value.    I would highly recommend this place.  I am looking forward to my next dining experience at Shoom Shoom, although I will likely be sharing an entree the next time around...although the oven baked Cod (Morrocan style) which came on a sizzling plate looked and smelled amazing."}
{"text":"Dropped by Shoom Shoom for lunch on a weekday afternoon. Since it is located in a suburban strip plaza right next to Longos, there are a lot of older ladies having leisure lunch here.. not too many working crowds so the pace here is a bit slow....and easy......  I have the say the food is really fresh and healthy, which I usually enjoy. However, I think now I know I am not too healthy as when eating lunch here, I have the urge to have unhealthy food. The Hummus are nice and tasty ($13.99).. out of the 4 selections I like the Fried Eggplant the most! (Yes the deep fried eggplant with heavy sauce). The Tabouleh is just too healthy for me........  Dark Meat Chicken ($4.99) and Beef ($6.49) skewers are both nicely done...  The Beef is cooked perfectly medium rare the way I like it. The chicken though taste pretty bland and a little undercook.  The service is nice and friendly. Though our waitress was a little overwhelmed when the place get busy later in the afternoon.  I might drop by again when I am in the area and have a craving for some healthy alternative compare to my Asian food! Or maybe one of their cocktails which is so interesting!"}
{"text":"Used a groupon voucher.  Perfect all the way through. Salad bar and soup was  good, lettuce was a bit browned though.  Beef and chicken kabobs were great, can use whatever sauce you want from the salad bar. Sweet potato fries were awesome.  Rice was also good.  Flatbread pitas were good and refilled promptly but unfortunately they were not made in house.  Girlfriend spilled her beer at the table.. bus boys cleaned up our mess and plates promptly. Server topped up the spilled beer for us.  Service was great.  Will return!"}
