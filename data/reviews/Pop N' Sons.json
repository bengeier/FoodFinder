{"text":"Me and my Girlfriend went here at 1 am for dinner and were BLOWN AWAY! The staff were incredibly kind and helpful in making sure we got exactly what we wanted, and the food was INCREDIBLE! I got the chili cheese dog which was delicious and my girlfriend got the ricotta cheese ravioli with marinara sauce. They asked if she wanted homemade meatballs added to her ravioli for $2.00 and she said no. They gave her a surprise free meatball in the corner of her ravioli dish, and it was TO DIE FOR! This place was so incredible that we came back the next night to try more things from their diverse and delicious menu! 10/10 would recommend for anyone looking for lunch, dinner, or even a late night snack!"}

{"text":"Food is so yummy!!! Service is amazing, tried the parm sub and it was fantastic! Must try this place!"}
{"text":"Best food I've ever had from a food truck, very friendly and delicious. The price of the food matches the quality.   After sticking around and learning their backstory they've honestly earned a customer for life. It's a son and father who put all of their chips on the table and took a chance to follow their dream of running a food truck. I respect them and will always recommend their food to anyone."}
