{"text":"Really tiny portions, overpriced and mediocre tasting. I got the grilled chicken sandwich and took over 10 minutes to make while being the only customer there. Paid over $10 for a burger and drink (not even fries!) and was not even close to full. The whole burger was maybe an inch thick from bun to bun."}
{"text":"Just paid almost $10 for a sandwich with hardly any meat or cheese. Waste of money...wasn't filling at all!"}
{"text":"Do Not Eat Here: I eat anything, but this?!?!

Paid $19 for a can of Coke - 1 small fries - And a \"Philly Cheese Steak\". I waited 20 minutes, and then got this:

1 great tasting coke. 1 small haft froze box of McCain-ish type Fries. Dry yet soggy. Had a freezer burned taste to them. The sandwich: Where do I start? The meat? Dry, old overcooked, then reheated in microwave. The meat had a gray like appearance. They put some odd raunchy tasting sauce on it. Guessing to hide the dryness. The cheese tasted like nothing. I looked to see if it was there. It was, in colour only. They put mushrooms on it. The mushrooms where gummie-bearie. I thought it was a pencil eraser, same kind of taste and texture. They also but some hot sauce on it. Maybe Sriracha Hot Chili, which I like but not on this. 

I eat out A LOT, I've had many Philly Cheese Steaks. Here in Toronto (home) and in the USP. I've never written a negative review, I've had many bad meals. This wasn't just prepared and cooked badly, it would taste horrible even if it was prepared and cooked correctly.  I would go to \"I went to Philly\" on Yonge street just around the corner, its good. And in Philly \"Pat's\" or \"Geno's\". Did I mention it was dirty and smelt bad? Would never eat there again!"}
{"text":"I went last night and I can truely say it's one of the best Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches I've ever had. Very proper."}
{"text":"I got this time chicken and cheese 8\" sub only and this update about it. 
Service: 5/5 (friendly staff and fast service) 
Clean: 5/5 (dining and kitchen area looks clean) 
Price: 3/5 ( over $9 for a sandwich only is pricey)
Promotion is available so that a good step. 
Amount: 2/5 (8\" not that fully loaded, most of it a bun)
Taste: 1/5 (Taste confused between bad and worst. Not like the steak and cheese sandwich this one was not good over all. 
Overall: 3.2 /5 (I have to try back the steak and cheese again. I don't recommend to try that much for me I will give it a last chance.  This time, I did not enjoy it at all. My next update it could be the final decision on this place. Based on the 2 visits it is 3.5 so far."}
{"text":"The service is very friendly, clean restaurant. I've only gone in the evening and it is not normal very busy. A bit of the expensive side but is better than subway or Quiznos. I've tried a few of the sandwiches chicken and philly steak. Would like to see a little more meat for the price. Packaging is nice foil for the sandwich and then in a box."}
{"text":"The neighbourhood anxiously awaited this new spot to open, after \" I Went To Philly\" at Yonge and College had to move north due to a condo development. Although the meat and sauce was quite tasty, for what you pay,  there was only half of the amount on the bun that the other spot used to serve. So we had mostly bread for our meal. The fries were completely under cooked and raw, were still potato white. The cook really should have seen they weren't ready. Least we tried the place!"}
{"text":"I think some of the reviewers are being too harsh here, but I kind of get it.  When you think \"steak and cheese\", you think greasy goodness.  This is quite the opposite.  It's fresh beef, natural ingredients and not greasy at all.

Personally, I really like that. I get sick after eating too much grease and this was the first time I had a steak and cheese without feeling bloated after.  I found it quite tasty.  

The guy working the cash was very friendly too (who I think was the owner).  My only qualm is that i found the fries a bit soggy and they could have been crispier.  However, I told him that and he just said \"thank you, next time tell us you want it crispy\".  So I really appreciate that.

Verdict: Decent lunch spot."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak sandwich combo. With student discount, it came out close to $12 with tax. 

The sandwich tasted okay but it was not worth the price. Probably the worst tasting fries I've had in years. The fries tastes equivalent to crappy frozen fries. 

The service was quite slow as well. It took about 10 minutes to receive my order. The worker was very friendly though. 

Overall I give it a 2/5 since the sandwich tasted okay."}
{"text":"Love Philly cheesesteak so thought I would give this place a try.  While it wasn't terrible it was no a Philly Cheesesteak.  Very little cheese or onions. No peppers.  Light on the meat.  Bun was very fresh and the food tasted ok. But maybe advertise as a grilled meat sandwich.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here since I was working nearby at an event. I also had a $5 off coupon when I visited their stall at the CNE. The sandwich as the CNE was decent and quite big so I decided to give them another shot. Boy was it a mistake.

I should have read the yelp reviews beforehand. I had to spend $10 to get $5 off. The large 8\" sub with combo was $14 with tax. HOLY....that is expensive for fast food. I am so lucky I had that $5 off or I would be steaming! 

The sandwich was so so so SO SO SO tiny. It was a children menu size and I got the big 8\"! I ate it in two bites. I wish I wasnt exaggerating. The sandwich was so pathetic it looked almost paper thin. There is no height to this thing. Toppings were all there but the thin bread made it look so disappointing. 

The fries were standard fare. The kind you can make at home. 

The only redeeming factor were the two nice students working there. I feel bad writing this as I am helping to get rid of their jobs. I hope this place closes down. It is suppose to service the Ryerson community and by its price point, its serving no one. 1 star for the two student staff. *"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place while looking for my car and was pleasantly surprised with the polite service. The sandwiches were awesome and my kids loved the poutine. I will make it a point to return."}
{"text":"Couldn't decide where to go for lunch so I just started walking east on Gerrard. The menu for this place is posted on the side of the building and its what caught my eye in the first place. Walking in, its a fairly small place, with just some high bar tables and stools to sit at. I ordered a standard philly cheesesteak as  combo with onion rings. The girl behind the counter was nice and friendly and the food took a few minutes to make, surprisingly long considering.... 

They put your cheesesteak into foil to keep it hot and then into a little sub sized box for you to take with you. The unfortunate part about this is that when you get back to eat it, you realize that the sandwich itself is significantly smaller than the box would have you believe. I was surprised at how small the sandwich was and how few toppings were on the sandwich, even though I'd said yes to everything she offered (mushrooms, cheese, peppers, onions, hot sauce, mayo and possibly something else).

The cheesesteak itself was underwhelming. Not much steak (and poor quality steak at that), very few toppings and if she put mayo and hot sauce on as I asked, I certainly couldn't find it. The cheese is much like a nacho cheese and I didn't get much cheese until I was onto my second half of the sandwich. The bun wasn't very big, or fluffy and it looked at little sad when I unwrapped it. The rings were very good but you don't get many for your money. While the flavor was okay, it really didn't live up to my first and only other philly cheesesteak experience in Vegas. Not much going on here and really not worth the money.

Overall, an okay place but I won't go out of my way to return. Nothing special about the sandwich, service was okay but not as fast as I would have liked, given I was the only customer, and the price was out of whack with what you end up with. There are better sandwich joints around than this one - I won't return!"}
{"text":"Was very excited with this opening but what a disappointment. All I can say is \"where's the beef\". Fries were from frozen!  Expensive too!"}
{"text":"I got the steak and cheese sandwich combo that included small fries and can of pop for $12 that was with a student discount so it's pretty pricy. The staff was very friendly but I found it a little silly when the cashier gestured toward the fridge and asked what kind of pop I wanted and all they had was coke. Some people don't like coke they should get more options.

Though the sandwich tasted good it was about 95% bun.  The fries are crap frozen fries they toss on the grill top. They had a weird aftertaste like they had been sitting in a fridge for a while.  It's too bad they didn't invest in a frier and serve fresh cut fries. 

All in all it was okay but I would save your money and go somewhere that serves proper sandwiches and fries for that kind of money. Walk down the street to Lou Dawg's."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs. The food is disappointing. Also, the owner (manager?) regularly blocks the bike lane in front of the shop to unload food items from his car. It's not only illegal, but dangerous to road users. Besides, the car looks very dirty on the inside. I wouldn't want to eat anything that has been transported in there."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely incredible. So delicious and juicy. I tried it at the CNE and need to go find the actual store to eat there again. It was SO good."}
