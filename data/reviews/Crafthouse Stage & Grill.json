{"text":"Terrible. Worst experience I've ever had. I usually read negative reviews and laugh because I can't believe someone's experience could have been that bad until last night. Complete chaos, can't call it had service case there was NO service. One star rating from valets and on. Nothing could make me go there again. They need to close, rehire and retrain and reopen."}
{"text":"Good food, decent beer menu, nice to have another place for bands to play. Service was decent for a busy Saturday nite. Docked two stars for devoting so much parking space to valet. I never choose valet; nothing screams pretentious like valet parking. And Curry Rd and pretentious don't go together. On the way in overheard a couple of valet parkers complaining about customers complaining about them. I'll go back but not soon mainly because of the parking situation."}
{"text":"We went on opening night because we read in a local newspaper about all of the remodeling they did. As soon as we got there we were greeted by a hostess and seated. They told us that they had a limited menu which seemed odd considering this was the grand opening. We all ordered hamburgers and asked that they be cooked well done and we also all ordered the fresh cut french fries. Once the food arrived, it was served on a metal lunch tray which was reminiscent of a prison tray. I assume they don't have plates. The presentation of the meal was terrible as everything was just thrown on the metal tray. As I looked at my burger, I noticed there was blood all over the bottom bun. I cut that part off and cut into my burger which wasn't anywhere near well done let alone anywhere near medium. The bun was also cold and must've just been taken out of a bag. My friend sent her meal back because her cheese burger was so pink inside. The waitress was courteous and brought out another cheese burger however this one was half the size of the original burger and was burnt like a charcoal brick. The cook also just threw two pieces of cold cheese on this burger. They at least melted the cheese on the original but this one was presented with two slices of cheese just thrown on top. As far as the \"fresh cut\" french fries go, they were simply frozen french fries that they just threw in a deep fryer. The burgers had no flavor and neither did the fries. The food was extremely plain and poorly made. Each burger was $13 and definitely not worth the price. I won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"First time we went took an hour to get drinks, my friends never got their food or what they ordered.  Gave it another try, did not get to sit with out party. My daughter's food was given to the wrong table. Took 20 minutes to get drinks and the place was empty. So could not understand why they where still sooo slow with service.   Food was cold. Appetizer came out with out with our meal so my husband no longer even wanted it."}
{"text":"Second time here. The food is passable. The service tonight is better than last time.
The bands both times suck. Nice dance floor but they don't seem to be able to attract bands that actually work the crowd or play music that you can dance to."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and we had a good waiter. There was 7 of us and none of us really enjoyed the food. We were pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection and specials.  Lots of food and drink specials for Happy Hour.  The tater tots are the best!  This place is huge."}
{"text":"Tried to charge us a cover just to eat dinner at 7:00 on a friday. We didn't stay and won't be back."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving it a 2 star instead of 1 is because the bartender was fabulous and we really enjoyed the guys from Sing Sing, but the rest explains why there was about 10 people in the whole bar.  With so few people there I have no idea why they have valet parking.  The food and table service where we sat to eat were terrible.  The waitress spilled water all over our beer menu while refilling and just left it, didn't bother to replace it even though we were still ordering.  It took well over an hour to get our food.  When the food came I said that's not the side salad I ordered, she just said nope it's the craft salad and walked away.  She came back to ask how the food was and never really gave us a chance to answer - my friends had flatbread and I had the chicken thighs.  All of it was burnt to a crisp.  Neither of my friends at even half of their flatbread.  She asked if we wanted boxes and when everyone said no she didn't even question if everything was ok with the food considering it wasn't touched.  Instead of asking if we needed anything else she just took the beer menu away and brought our checks.  When I pointed out I didn't eat my salad because it wasn't what I ordered and it wasn't good she actually argued with me about what I ordered and just said FINE I'll take care of it and walked away.  We moved to the bar where we had more drinks and thankfully finally had good service and entertainment.   I would return for the entertainment, but we would meet elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place. Remodeled and looks good. Understaffed and the little staff they have is rude and slow, I mean really slow. The waitress who had brown hair and a little bigger was really rude. The one with red hair did a good job and was friendly. I ordered drafts and got bottles. They put extra money on my bill. They need to step it up a knotch. Band was good."}
{"text":"Honestly I never knew this place was there until a friend told us about it. It is pretty hidden in the suburbs of the South Hills.  We got there early on a Friday night as they have a great happy hour special.  Select draft beers were 1/2 off  and they have a very nice selection. I went with a Vermont beer that was a pineapple shandy. It was a little flat so for my next beer I went with the McKenzie's Black Cherry cider which never disappoints.  Select appetizers (only about 4) were 1/2 off and we went with the boneless buffalo wings. They have many sauces to choose from and we stuck with the traditional buffalo sauce served with blue cheese. I was extremely impressed as the wings were not fried and great quality chicken.  I ordered the buffalo chicken flatbread as my entrée=-it was a 1/2 price appetizer and to be honest not very good. There was too much cheese and the flatbread was very doughy.  I blame myself for ordering the wrong thing and I should have stuck with ordering a salad or burger.  My fiancé got the chicken gyro wrap with fries. He was extremely happy with his choice and the fries are fresh cut and top notch.  Our waitress  was fantastic and I would go back and order something different next time.  A band was playing later that night but we got in before it got crowded and the cover charge started."}
{"text":"Crafthouse is really nice looking bar & valet parking is a nice touch but didn't use.
I went their May 7th & it was my first time there & it was a very bad experience left a bad taste 
Manager on duty don't care about making customers happy he just walked around.
I had to get a waitress to take our order that's after sitting there for about an hour wine prices are different a glass of merlot was $7 at bar & $5 at table??? Food was alright tasted better. 
Have a nice bar but if experience was bad that don't mean nothing.Did tell the dingbat of a manager it was my first time there & not coming back I didn't want anything free I just wanted my friends & me to be treated like we mattered.
I did tell all my friends about my experience there....word of mouth is best advertisement."}
{"text":"At our second visit, we were dismayed to find out that they have done away with two of our favorite menu items.  The seared ahi tuna tacos are gone, replaced with Thai shrimp tacos with \"Asian mushroom slaw\", which sounded good but tasted like it was out of a can, watery and metallic-tasting.  The truffle fries are still on the menu, but the fries they have made them with have changed.  They used to be ultra-crispy, almost like they were breaded.  Now they are \"hand-cut\", which is harder to pull off.  The result was limp and greasy, albeit truffley and cheesy.  Also, the food took forever to arrive.  Still, my hubby's Creole pasta was tasty, and the beer selection was still top notch, so he was happy.  But the establishment's shiny first experience has certainly dimmed a bit.  What will our third visit hold for us?"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! January the manager is a pro! Macy the bartender is awsome! Even the dishwasher was professional! Great food! Great bowling! Very relaxed for all ages! Wings awsome! Everything priced right! Beer cold! Great cigar bar.. this is the all-in-one place! Been in industry all my life. Trust me you won't be disappointed. Great work! Way to care bout your guests!"}
{"text":"One waitress was very rude, saying \"You can't be served without being at a table\" even though we were seated. The service was slow...took 30+ minutes to get a menu. Ordered a draft and was given a bottle. Also we noticed that the prices on the menu did not match prices on the receipt; this is totally unacceptable. Place has lots of potential however."}
{"text":"I was at the Craft House Friday night and got there early (6:30) since we had a group of seven.  Upon entering, we saw a car parked on the snowy hillside looking like it would topple over with a slight push.  When I got inside, I learned it was a friend's car parked on the hill and she used valet!  
I kept thinking they better not park my brand new car in that area.  The valet lot was empty!  I pushed the thought aside but guess where it was parked?  Directly behind my friend right up against the bumper sideways on that hill!  This is a great venue for live entertainment but I will not deal with that parking arrangement!  Get rid of valet!"}
{"text":"If zero stars was an option, this place would get it. Went to see Cold Hard Cash and had the tickets since December. Get there at 7:15 and waited for 20-25 min to get in. They had folding chairs set up near the stage, and they were completely full or covered in coats and bags from people saving them for others. There were no tables or seats at the bar. I asked a waitress where we were supposed to sit and she said everything was first come, first serve. I'm not sure what having a ticket did for us. They had the couches \"reserved\" as others have posted. Cold Hard Cash was amazing, but we couldn't stay for the show because we were so uncomfortable from standing for 2 and a half hours. Not one waitress or bar tender offered us anything. We won't ever go back."}
{"text":"I liked the new look.  They even have a cigar bar.   Good food.  Good service
I didn't like the valet parking but you can choose to park your own car in a side lot and walk a short distance to the entrance.  
It seemed to me that they are trying to make it a nice, safe place to spend an evening.   The band was good and they have in house security."}
{"text":"The bar was nice and the bartender was attentive. The food however was not very good. The pizza was ok and the wings were borderline awful! Really ... How do you screw up wings. When told that the food was not very good the staff could care less. For the money spent I expected more. The owner sat next to us and could care less that we weren't happy with the food. I may stop back, but only for a drink. I'll go someplace else if we are planning on eating anything at all."}
{"text":"Great place!  Bar seats about 50 people, room for about 150 more at tables and floor.  Live bands, great sound system, great food."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere is good. 

They need to address the policy on band members saving tables. I was third in line waiting at the door and only to find that band members had saved 12 seats in the front row. This is a terrible practice. Keep in mind I'm a paying customer who purchased tickets and has dropped $150 before the band has not even started. 

Crafthouse please change your practices."}
{"text":"What a diamond! We went here for a pretty late meal and their kitchen was still open at 10:00 pm. Their buffalo chicken wrap was amazing (their sauce was spicy and sweet). You have to upgrade your fries to the truffle parmesan fries. 

The service was also great! The music and line dancing was... interesting but it is definitely a place to try out!"}
{"text":"Been here several times now!!! GREAT experience! Every dish my wife and I have ordered has been on-spot and fantastic. I had seen the early reviews about service, but didn't experience any issues any of the times we were there. I even mentioned something to one of the waitresses about it and she said it was \"1st night gitters\". They have apparently corrected their hiccups. The staff was very friendly and the live music was awesome.
This is exactly what the South Hills has needed!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night for LIVE MUSIC!   What a delight!  Ordered the Prime Steak Salad and regret that I didn't snap a photo.  It had thinly sliced prime steak, done rare to medium rare, and served cold.  It was awesome.  And, truffle fries to boot!  Both the steak and the truffle oil set the flavor of this salad served over fresh mixed greens.  No head lettuce here!  I will definitely be back for this salad!  Oh, and the beer special was a $3 Miller Lite draft.  Aaah."}
{"text":"Crafthouse is the perfect example of when a business can't stick with one idea and seems to fail everywhere else.

Upon arriving I noticed the valet, which seemed very out of place. I really disliked this; not only is the idea of a valet silly in a place where parking is a breeze but it feels cheap. 

The restaurant itself was very nice and new, unfortunately smelled like wet paint--not so appetizing. There was a live band the evening of my visit but the restaurant was just about half way full, perhaps they should section parts off? It just seemed sad to have a good band playing to a dead room. 

I ordered the buffalo chicken salad; it was nothing more than chicken fingers on a bed of ice burg lettuce, not the bed of mixed greens as advertised. It wasn't awful but absolutely not worth the $14/15 it cost. Those I was with agreed that the food was bland and very overpriced.

Our service wasn't bad and the drinks were good but ultimately over priced and in need of better direction by management."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great.  50 beers on draft.  Nice Happy Hour specials on drinks and food.  Stayed for the band that came on at 9.  Nice little stage and dance area.  Overall, high grades for my first visit since the renovation."}
{"text":"Have visited a few times now and really love it. The food is top notch. You have to try the candied bacon.  Service is top notch and it's super clean."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Friendly service, great food, live music, and a vast beer offering. Will definitely will be back. Word to the wise- order the crispy potato skin. They are insanely delicious!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers. Very friendly staff...always a plus. Good music, even though I wasn't in for live music. Inventive menu. Had the gyro salad, which was excellent. Ordered wings to go as they make their own sauces. Plus you can bowl a few lanes in the connected alleys."}
{"text":"Been there twice so far, once for drinks and the latest for dinner. I had chicken tacos and my wife had a burger. The chicken was a little dry but overall the tacos aren't bad. My wife really liked her burger. Beer selection is good without anything special to offer. We will continue to try it."}
{"text":"Used to love it here, but tonight not so much. Out of multiple main stay liquors. Changed my favorite recipe and you could not even hear the band in the whole back half of bar."}
{"text":"Love this place. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that there isn't as much seating as I'd like. The couches are lovely but impossible if you want to eat. 

All in all, I've never had a bad time there. It's so nice to have a cool place like this so close to home."}
