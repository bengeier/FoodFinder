{"text":"This restaurant doesn't even deserve half a star. They put me off from eating Pho for a very long time. The restaurant is dirty, the food tastes like it was all cooked in a microwave and the BEST part was the hair and bug I found in my vermicelli. I wouldn't go to this restaurant if it was the last food source on earth.   Clean up your act, you have A LOT of competition."}
{"text":"best Vietnamese restaurant I have ever gone to in my entire life!!!! Quick service, friendly staff, and great food for a great price!!! Definitely recommend checking this restaurant out!!!!"}
{"text":"Legit! Yes I said it, seriously legit Vietnamese restaurant finally in the SW!  It's a small restaurant tucked in a mall plaza and can easily be missed, seems like all the goods spots are easy to miss :p  I had ordered B10 (see photo), the portion was huge and the price? $8.95!  Seriously that's less than some of the places in the SE. Meat was flavourful and the spring rolls weren't filled with mystery funkyness.  Service was good and no issues.  Triple threat here, location, value and taste!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food used to be so much better, but the noodle soup has gone downhill, the soup base is on the sweet side which I don't like, the noodles are stuck together. One time ordered vermicelli and the chicken tasted raw. The only thing still good is the sub. Portion in this place is big."}
{"text":"This is a go-to for inexpensive serviceable food in this area when we need a quick break for lunch. It's nice to know what we will get and that it's dependable. It's not the best we've ever had but a far cry from the worst so we will go back again."}
{"text":"Satay Beef soup is the best Pho in the city .Great spicy flavors with hints of lemongrass, the best satay broth I've ever tasted . This place is always insanely busy so I don't really like eating in but pick up is fast and efficient. Not a huge fan of other dishes, there are better places to get the bun style vermicelli and rice dishes. Just get the soup!"}
{"text":"Been here many times. Convenient location.  Really like their vermicelli with chicken(I don't remember what number it is). The chicken is very juicy and flavorful. The pork one is ok. Only one small complaint on the vermiciTheir Pho is tasty too. My taste buds like this restaurant because I don't get thirty afterwards(usually thirst for me is a sign of MSG). I wish they would expand their space. It's way too crowded inside. I try not to eavesdrop on my neighbours' conversation, but I can't help it even when I don't want to! Service is rushed, as soon as our bowls are empty the bill shows up on our table  almost instantly."}
{"text":"This place is perfect. I find that they are always quite fast, and the food is incredible. I have eaten here with quite a few friends... and they all think it's the best in the city as well! One of my besties will literally drive from New Brighton all the way up here to pick up her pho. The spicy beef pho is incredible. It's not INCREDIBLY spicy, but it's super delicious. And consistantly good. I also love their lemongrass chicken bun. One of my favorite things to order is their squid appetizer. It's like salt and pepper squid with a sweet chili dipping sauce and it is so perfect. It's so lightly breaded and the squid is always so tender! It comes out piping hot though, so it's worth giving a minute for it to cool down. This place is fabulous, and with Pho Huong Viet in business, you really don't have to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I've tried a LOT of Vietnamese places in the city and this one is still always my go-to. Good prices, great food. Always quick even though they are literally packed all hours they are open. As with many pho spots they are closed Mondays, and due to the vast number of people they serve despite being so tiny, service could be a little better. These two things are why it's four stars and not five."}
{"text":"We have been going here (and the 17th ave location) for several years.  Consistently good/excellent food at excellent prices. Consistently fast service and food.  I finally decided to post a review.  I like 'B7.'  No kids menu, though mine have never complained. I am surprised at people having poor experiences here, but I guess anything is possible."}
{"text":"Good value, generous portions and prompt service. Most importantly the food was delicious."}
{"text":"When you're hungry and feel like Vietnamese, this is the place to go. Very fast service, huge servings and a great taste. Just be prepared to wait to be seated during rush hours as the place is small... but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent deep fried rolls. Huge portions and tasty food. Better come here with a big appetite. There's a short line up always around 5-10 mins but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and it was very busy. No matter... the staff did a great job making sure I was looked after and that I found a spot as quickly as possible. I had never eaten Pho before so I asked the waitress for some recommendations and she pointed out the two most popular... one that is listed as mildly spicy and one that is not. I like spicy foods so I went with the first option and was pleasantly surprised that it was much more than mildly spicy. This Pho in a word... beautiful. I got the Large bowl and it was MASSIVE. As for the bill, very reasonable for what you receive. I am definitely coming back to try the other options."}
{"text":"We are fairly well versed in Vietnamese restaurants and have found that Pho Huong is a great addition to the NW culinary circle.  The broth is decent, food is fresh, portions are large and service quick!  Of course, nothing beats our favorite Trong Khan off of centre street (1115 Centre Street North), but this place is a great standby!"}
{"text":"I used to think this was a 3.5/5 restaurant considering the location (SW is not known to have good pho) but ever since I went to the other location in Ranchland, my opinion for this restaurant has been downgraded. The broths are the same but the noodles are much better up North. (yes, it makes a big difference!)"}
{"text":"2 stars. I have  been to many Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary and Pho Huong just isn't a favorite. The service was quite slow: in fact they misplaced the order. The Beef Pho and Lemongrass BBQ Chicken vermicelli were both not overly flavorful. Prices are low however it just isn't good value with poor quality dishes."}
{"text":"Always busy and always good. Sometimes you have to wait for a table but the place is large and you never have to wait too long, besides it is worth the wait. The staff is friendly, helpful and service is quick. The menu has a good selection with very reasonable prices and the food is always fresh and very tasty. Possibly the best Pho in Calgary. I have been going here for years and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The vermicelli, pho and subs are all consistently amazing. The salad rolls are not the greatest I've had but that being said the spring rolls are some of the best. They use very high quality meat which sets them apart from many other Vietnamese restaurants"}
{"text":"This is my go to Vietnamese restaurant. I'm glad to see they've been very successful after moving from their modest location by Westbrook Mall.   Pho Houng has a broad menu with many excellent dishes. Prices are very reasonable, portions are huge and service is quick. All in it's exactly why I hope for. Do try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Default location for pho. Accept no substitutes. Always busy, time to expand. Great prices."}
{"text":"This is a tiny little restaurant located in a strip mall at the corner of Nose Hill Drive and Ranchlands Boulevard.  It has about twelve tables, some seating four and others seating two.  This restaurant would not be a good choice for someone with a mobility impairment.  When we arrived at 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon, the restaurant was packed- we got the last table!  They were also doing a busy take-out business with many styrofoam containers heading out the door as we ate.    We started with vegetarian spring rolls, which were served very quickly.  They were noticeably large and had a surprisingly dense filling- yum!  As a main course I had the \"vegetarian\" pho (I'm sure it's not vegetarian but I'm not picky about soup stocks), which was a good-sized portion of vermicelli, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower and (too many) raw onions.  Yeah, I know I didn't have meat in my soup, but it would have been nice for the broth to have a bit more depth of flavour.  I noticed that some soups were served in larger bowls- those portions were HUGE!  I also saw lots of rice and noodle dishes coming out of the kitchen, and I think I would opt for one of them next time (there WILL be a next time!).  Our food came VERY quickly and service was friendly and attentive.    The Crowfoot area is full of chain restaurants, and it's nice to discover something locally-owned in the area.  Pho Huong is definitely a good choice if you're in the far NW!"}
{"text":"This is just awesome food for a very cheap price. I go here probably twice a month and usually just get the same noodle dish. They have a huge variety of stuff that comes in a bowl and my favourite one seems to have everything in it, including their delicious spring rolls. You get so much food it's almost guaranteed (unless you are feeling a little voracious) that you will have leftovers...I make 2 full meals oout of every order! The only thing I ordered that I wasn't a big fan of was the fried squid. The restaurant is small but they pack people in quite comfortably. It's best to go outside common lunch hours though because you will have to deal with probably the worst parking lot in town!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant for dining in and takeout, many, many, many times!  The food is fresh and delicious, with prompt service regardless if you're dining in or out.  I've never had a bad meal and it continues to be one of my favourites in the city.  I can't recommend just one dish as they are all really good!"}
{"text":"Busy little hole-in-the-wall restaurant with fantastic pho. Some of the best pho in Calgary.  Deep fried squid appetizer is always tender, and the spring rolls are dense and rich with flavour.  I usually get a vermicelli bowl, and my wife has the beef & tripe soup. Flavours are tasty, fresh and succulent. Service is always swift, prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. Can't comment on any dessert as we never have room! Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"Every time I come back to Calgary, I make a date with myself to come here and have their beef sate pho.  It is absolutely out of this world! The beef is never tough and they don't make it too spicy.  I love the mountain of basil and sprouts they give you with it, they're always fresh and delicious to snack on while you wait for your soup (which is rarely longer than 8 minutes even in the lunch rush).  I 100% recommend going here, as I still have yet to find a place that makes better food at a more reasonable price. A medium sized bowl of amazing pho for $8.19 all in? Yes please!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for about 10 years now(back when they were on Bow Trail across from Safeway).  The springrolls are the best in town, actually even better than the ones my wife and I had in Vietnam(and they were pretty good) I always get the B11 and my wife gets the #9 soup. Latley my wife has turned me onto the Taro Root Bubble Tea. It's Tasty!  This is a family run business. The price is average and the food is well above aver\ge."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a great local, family owned business and it's definitely in the top three Vietnamese places in Calgary according to my taste buds.  You can expect great, quick service. Portions are very generous and everything tastes really fresh. I'm a big fan of their Beef Sate Vermicelli dish.  There's lots of parking and it's very easily accessible from 17th, although there is a fair amount of construction in that area. It's a bit tucked in, so look at a google map or something before heading out."}
{"text":"Ordered the sate beef pho and it was one of the best I have ever had. Place was fairly busy when I went to pick it up even at 2pm. My order was ready and waiting so the server quickly cashed me through. Large was enough for two of us at work to share."}
{"text":"Wow, busy, lots of action both eat in and take out. We went at 630 pm on a Wednesday, I was impressed how busy it was. Food overall was good, bun Bo hue was flavorful, pho was as well. I ordered the deep fried squid as per someone's review but I found it a bit too greasy, maybe it was due to volume and they were rushing everything, I'm not sure. I'd probably just do take out next time because it was so busy so a bit hard for a family of 5."}
{"text":"Always a great choice for lunch or dinner! Large portion sizes for really great value. The #1 Pho option (Satay beef) is always a good bet!"}
{"text":"The portions and prices are great!  The taste is also very good but the chicken is very tendinous and poorly cut, making it hard to eat using chopsticks.  We had to ask multiple times for water and the place was packed and tiny."}
{"text":"The Pho is very flavourful and the bun is fresh, service is as expected in an Asian restaurant. The restaurant is quite small and is very crowded during the lunch time so I would recommend coming during off hours."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some Pho or vermicelli. They do have rice and egg noodle dishes as well if you want to get something a bit different. This is one of my favorite places to get a satay pho in town. The place is also a favorite for being cheap but it is a popular spot so you might have to wait a bit to get a seat for supper 5-7pm. If we don't want to deal with the crowds I'll order take out and I believe they do have delivery."}
{"text":"Best sate beef noodle soup. Hands down.  The flavour is just bang-on. Yummy charbroiled beef skewers appetizer. Sooo good. I haven't been there since they moved locations because of C-train development (it seems every time I feel like going, it is a Monday and they're closed Mondays). So reasonable!!! They bring out everything FAST! It's a lil no frills and no fuss but what's wrong with that sometimes? Perfect for a chilly night when you want a tasty impact."}
{"text":"Best bowl of Viet noodles Ive ever had! Home made peanut sauce and soup broths, they are the real thing. Portions are big! New favorite spot for a big bowl of soup or noodles."}
{"text":"Had the sate beef sub and salt and pepper wings for lunch.  Wings were decent but on the smallish side.  The sub was very good and spicy with a nice crunchy bun.  Busy place on a sat afternoon."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Our meals were full of black bits from their oven. Meat was the most horrible thing I have ever gotten from a reateraunt. Then the owner called my sister and yelled at her. I will be calling health canada !"}
{"text":"After a novice hockey game for one son followed closely by a swimming lesson for the other, the boys and I decided to \"try something different\", meaning not fast food. We checked out on Yelp! what was close to the pool, and Pho Huong  Viet looked good. It was less than an hour before closing when we arrived. We had a chicken wonton soup, a beef ball pho, and a grilled pork sub. And spring rolls to share, but the boys decided not to try them, so I got them all to myself. The service was fast, if a bit curt (it didn't help that we arrived near closing and my younger son took almost 15 minutes to figure out what he wanted). The food arrived quickly and everything was delicious. The comment from the boys was \"We love Vietnamese food! When can we come back?\" I passed these comments on to the owner, who beamed with pride. For my money, that's about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Vietnamese at its best.  Wife and I ordered vermicelli bowls, mine the pork, chicken prawn and hers the BBQ chicken.  Tried both and they were both fresh, seasoned and well portioned as we've come to expect from Vietnamese restaurants.  Spring rolls crunchy, delicious and we found ourselves wanting more.  Service was quick, friendly and accurate.  Plenty of other patrons were enjoying Pho and it looked and smelled incredible, almost made me jealous.  The restaurant is quite small but that's nothing to complain about once you've tried the food. Bring a friend and enjoy something aside from the same Beef, Chicken, Pork Alberta is known for."}
{"text":"Great beef sate pho and consistently quick and efficient service."}
{"text":"One of the best pho places in town. Very consistent in the flavour. Sometimes when they're swamped it does get a bit longer wait for the food to come but otherwise they are quick and efficient. The MSG is not bad compared to majority of the pho places here in Calgary. They have two locations (NW and SW) so both sides of Calgary are able to enjoy the good food they make!"}
{"text":"This is our favourite pho place in town. The #1 sate beef soup is AMAZING, and the medium soup, at $7.95, is incredible value (and I can barely finish it!) This place often lines up, but they are efficient at getting people in and served, in a clean and friendly environment. We find the quality of the beef to be much higher than many other Vietnamese places in town, and frequent this place almost weekly. FYI- if you order take out they do a wonderful job at packaging pho- some places put the beef in the soup and its well done by the time you get home, but here they package the raw beef separately so it doesn't start cooking until you are home and put it in the broth!"}
{"text":"This is the third location for these 17th Ave Vietnamese restaurant veterans. Their food is the draw and is fantastic!  Their noodle dishes with fresh lettuce, pickled carrots and (always) cucumbers would make a vegetarian drool... however their charbroiled pork with onions and amazing spring rolls keep us carnivores feed... and well!  Another of my favs is their beef satay soup. It's not for the faint of heart (or heart burn) as it is a little spicy. If you just have to try it (despite the heat), make sure to squeeze juice from the lime wedge into your soup to temper it a little.  The one unfortunate part of this new location is that it is quite small. Don't let that stop you however! If you manage to get a seat, enjoy the food! If not they also do take out... so take out."}
{"text":"Best in the NW community if not the whole Calgary. Super fresh ingredients, large and honest portions, no msg!! Just honest and home cooked food. I normally don't order noodle soups because I hate msg, but I won't fret about having that here! Love this place."}
{"text":"This is the best pho that I have had in Calgary thus far. The ambience is very casual - no pretense. :-)  They have another location off of 17 ave and 38th street but this has been the best of the two in my experience. I always have the chicken noodle soup  (either large or medium) with a pot of tea. It is delicious, a bargain, and the portion is generous. The service has been great. This is definitely a favourite. It is often busy so avoid the peak times."}
{"text":"As you all know Vietnamese are famous for their beef noodle soup. I look for full burst flavoured soup that. The soup here is almost as good as the other location on 17th Ave SW. The place is a little small most of the time you have to wait for a table.  Service was good.  closed in Monday's."}
{"text":"As you all know Vietnamese are famous for their beef noodle soup. I look for full burst flavoured soup that. The soup here have that one of the best beef soups in town. The fish sauce and sub are very well done. Place was very clean. Service was good. If you are a fan of Vietnamese Beef Soups this is a must try..."}
{"text":"Been going to this family restaurant for the last 8 years. Never disappointed. Just make sure u go for large size n dont forget their bbq skewers...wow becoming a phò-coholic one of these days."}
{"text":"Good food, but the service is terrible. Getting our order taken can be painfully slow, even on average night. I fully recommend take out instead."}
{"text":"Super fast service, amazing pho broth, delicious food and the bbq wings were way better than we ever imagined. This is absolutely our new favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary. Best we've had here by far."}
{"text":"4-1/2 stars, really.  This is a small hole-in-the-wall place that serves superior Pho. I've been to a lot of Pho restaurants in the NW in search of the best, and this place is it. Their Pho is the right amount of flavour in the broth, with good portion sizes, and very quick courteous service.  I've come here several times and ordered different dishes each time:Steak and noodle, Chicken and noodle, and triple-pork (I forget the exact name) pho. All were delicious in their own way. I've also twice ordered spring rolls to start and have always enjoyed them: crispy and containing a good blend of meat (or veggies) and sprouts.  What amazes me the most about this place is the speed with which the pho comes! You've barely had a chance to settle in and the giant bowl of great-tasting broth and meat is in front of you.  The space itself is crowded and tight, so that's the only downside. (It's hardly surprising, considering the quality, that it's always packed.)   Come and eat their pho! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I had a take out sate seafood after reading the reviews here. It was truly the most delicious sate soup I've had, reminiscent of a Singaporean Mee Siam and with such a good kick! I will be back with the family to try different dishes!  The service for takeout was quick and efficient. Well packed, great portion."}
{"text":"First time here and I will be back!!!! Can't believe I haven't been here before or stumbled upon it?   The service here was fast and we were seated right away, even though it was really busy. I had the lemongrass beef with Vermicelli and my friend had the beef pho. Always staple items and a must have at any Vietnamese restaurant. We also shared the Spring rolls. The food was amazing. I didn't want to share but really wanted to try my friend's pho and it was one of the best I have had in Calgary. All the food was great and the service is really quick too. Our servers were really friendly and food was quick after we ordered too.  The food here is extremely high-quality, inexpensive and very authentic. A real gem in the Northwest and now I see why it's so busy. Will be back again when I need a Vietnamese food fix."}
{"text":"fav. Place for Salad roll- with shrimp. Fried chicken are good too, I love half half to collage. Pho 1 is spicy good. Icy Papaya bubble tea tastes better than hot one. Fried banana are wrapped with spring roll sheet."}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite meals in recent memory. After a long day of visiting family-in-law for a post-wedding meet-the-couple kind of celebration at a community hall, followed by a gift opening (yawn), I was seriously starving. The desserts at the community hall event had kiwi on them, which I am mega-allergic to, so I hadn't eaten since my disastrous Italian lunch date.  My husband's sister (the post-bride), who lives in Calgary, suggested Pho Huong Viet Noodle House. I love Vietnamese food so I was excited, but I had never been to a restaurant on her recommendation, so I had no idea what to expect.  They seated us quickly (table of 6) and gave us menus and drinks. Normally I would find it tacky, but in a Vietnamese or other ethnic restaurant, I find it really helpful when they have photos in the menu. They have a photo for literally every single menu item here. Amazing.  My spring rolls were ridiculously tasty. They came right after I ordered them. I got the veg, my husband ordered the meaty ones. I seriously can't decided which ones I liked more. They were both very tasty in their own way.  Our entrees came pretty quickly, too. My beef and veggies and rice weren't particularly exotic (I thought I'd play it safe), but very delicious. The rice was steamed, but had a faint flavour of coconut. Yum!  I was happy, full, and my wallet wasn't sad, either. $9 for a huge entree? Yeah, very impressed.  Calgary: I'm so jealous. You guys can go here anytime you want! So don't disappoint me. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant that is so busy I usually call my order in advance.  This place rocks.  Portion size, flavor and a staff that gives a crap.  The only thing is I worry they are so busy they are going to burn out.  They may need a bigger restaurant to keep making my BEEF!  Love this place, I see you tomorrows."}
{"text":"Nothing ends an almost-three-week juice cleanse like a few days of good broth-based soup, and what better soup to start with than a nice healthy bowl of delicious pho?  I was craving pretty much everything under the sun for the last two weeks so when it came time to start going back to normal we got this crazy awesome hour long thunderstorm and the first thing that came to mind was \"this is perfect pho weather, I'm going to have some for dinner!\" That led to looking up local places that had decent reviews, menu and pricing.  This place stood out and I suggested to D that we go try it.  Some reviews say they have a bit of a wait due to popularity so we weren't altogether surprised that there were 3 parties ahead of us when we got there.  The wait really wasn't that bad though, we were seated within 5-10 minutes which worked out well.  The place was packed and smelled really good, the area was pretty clean and the food looked great on the other tables.  The woman who took our order seemed to be in a bit of a hurry, we had to keep calling her bit of our order just to get drinks while she was walking away on us.  That was the only downside.  The drinks arrived fairly quickly, I had tea and D had a coke.  I almost went with a bubbletea but that's too much too soon so I'm waiting until our next visit for that.  Our food came not too long after.  I received, with the drinks, a nice big plate of fresh beansprouts, lime wedge and basil leaves.  The bowl of soup that came was only a medium size, the large is enormous, and I had the #1 - Beef Sate soup (the popular one everyone should try if they like spice).  D got the lemongrass chicken bowl with springrolls, salad and vermicelli.  The soup was fantastic - a perfect blend of spice (not just your normal 'oh lets drizzle some chili oil on top and call it sate' type soup that I've found is typical of Calgary Vietnamese places), with tasty big strips of beef, green onion, and noodles that were so easy to work with and very tasty with the hoisin sauce.  The noodles picked up the spice of the broth really well so I drank most of the tea no problem.  It was heaven in a bowl...so delicious!  I even at most of what few beansprouts didn't make it in to my bowl.  I couldn't finish the noodles though, too long without food I hadn't had a chance to ask for light on the noodles and they were so tasty I had to cut myself off before I hurt something.  I got to try a bite of D's spring roll and it was delicious - crispy outside, soft well-seasoned filling and I might try that bowl next time...If I don't go for that awesome spicy beef pho again!  Our main server was very attentive, coming by occasionally to make sure everything was good.  He was very pleasant and if we actually had needed something I had the feeling we wouldn't be waiting very long for assistance.  We're definitely going back, and I'm hoping to try the salad rolls next time.  Best Vietnamese I've had since moving out here, and that would be pretty hard to beat it was so delicious!"}
{"text":"Have been ordering here for over a year, ordered tonight and all dishes were absolute crap. Defiantly will not be ordering from here any more. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I thought I'd give this place one more try and once again, I was disappointed. The crispy spring rolls had little flavor, rather bland and what flavor they did have was somewhat off. The chicken was really fatty and seemed smothered in some weird sauce that tasted like a combination of BBQ and teriyaki sauce. Yuck. I was really hoping more for that charbroiled taste but didn't find it with my dish today. Also lacking was any hint of lemongrass. WTF? Don't put lemongrass in the title of the food if it's not an ingredient. I guess it's my own fault for wanting to give this place another shot at satisfying my craving. Bazinga! Joke's on me. Don't waste your time on Pho Huong. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good but too much msg, I wish restaurants would stop putting that poison in the food, no need to add that crap"}
{"text":"I love Vietnam food.  This is the best in Calgary. I order the B11 usually. It is always good.  And cheap.  I also think there spring rolls are the best. Even better than in Vietnam."}
{"text":"Went out to eat here tonight to show hubby the light on some Calgarian Pho. I enjoyed my take out mucho last time I came here not too long ago.  I believe that very recently, this place was named in the newspaper as a well liked, well blogged about spot for a good meal under $10 so of course the place was packed, even at 8pm on Tues night. Got a table wedged in between 2 other couples. Thankfully a little ways away from the door b/c everytime it opened, in whooshed the North Pole Gale Winds. Service was fine. Waitress just gettin' on thru her shift singing some old song by Chantal  Kreviazuk - entertaining... a little pitchy tho! ha! Food was good (Spring rolls, Pho - 1 being chicken, the other shrimp soup (I had held the crabstick and squid) ) but the 2 quiffy student nimrods beside us were the real slim shadies through and through, shouting, yelling, swearing, honking their noses over and over in napkins...just being obnoxious and grosse. Hubs and I looked at each other and thought, yaaaa, this is a take out place! Man, we came here to save a few bucks on eating out but it made me want to run out and try Rush. Stay tuned for next week's eat-out adventure! LOL!"}
{"text":"My favourite pho place in Calgary. Good portions at a very reasonable price. Service is really quick. Their sate pho is so good! I crave it once a week. Only thing to note is this place is usually super busy. I guess its just a sign that this place is really good"}
{"text":"Your search is over! Huong Viet is quite possibly the best fast Vietnamese food in the city. The portions are enormous, the prices are extremely reasonable and generally quite low compared to competitors, and the flavours are dead on. One of their signatures is fried onions on the bun vermicelli. Nice touch. Tea is also on the house, another refreshing gesture.  You can choose from many different protein options and combinations. Service is fast and friendly. The bubble tea is excellent and made with solid ingredients. You really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Just not as good as Saigon Royal in Calgary south, Watercress further east on 17th Ave SW, and certainly not as Pure Contemporary Vietnamese Kitchen on 8th Ave. SW, settled into a fairly large bowl of bun bo hue after having asked for pho bun hue, a very different dish.  After squeezing lime, added basil leaflets and sprouts from a wee mountain, tasted the fine mild broth. Was okay, but mild is not necessarily pleasing. So added one generous squeeze of heat and two of brown sauce in my hapless attempt to approximate flavours that are characteristic of good-great Vietnamese noodle and sandwich houses.   ***  And herein is the give-away: the best Viet noodle houses in Asia and Canada do NOT put big plastic bottles of sauce on their tables!!!  They are absent.  The furthest they go is perhaps add a shallow little dish of dipping sauce to enhance only certain portions of an artful meal!  Therefore ... in pho, the kitchen devises special, full and rich broth, and ingredients are at such a high standard in flavour and texture that added sauces are unnecessary! The kitchen crafts your meal to please their gifts and their guests! And that, good readers, distinguishes a chef from a short-order cook! And great pho from a dumbed-down lazy one.  ***  As for this pho, the beef that came in the form of thin slices of brisket, chunks of sausage, and tripe (not in the menu) was okay, but short in supply. And the small quantity of over-cooked white round noodles added nothing to this soup! I guess the mountain of fresh bean sprouts were to replace them? What a drag. Serving a chorus of white faces, Pho Huong is obviously catering to a crowd who know their style of 'cuisine,' but for the most part likely don't know about the real deal on the streets of Vietnam's cities and towns.  The plus side? The prices are lower than most other places, but that could also result on the downside re. what we go to a restaurant for! Decor pleasant enough, and tables arranged with discreet distance from others makes it possible to have a visit even when busy on a warm Tuesday evening.  Just average, I won't bother to return.  Please do yourself a favour, foodies, and check out Pure Contemporary Vietnamese Kitchen on the fringe of the downtown core? Now THAT pho and Pham's other dishes should be great!  Or on your next trip to Asia, do a month in Vietnam and across the country do the street scene thoroughly to get what really good pho is all about. The good houses dare not dumb down their creations!"}
{"text":"We went here on our way from Glacier NP to Banff. We wanted some Vietnamese food. Most of our group ordered pho. The broth is good and the portion is big, especially the large bowl. The well done meat is a bit chewy, but the tendons and rare steak are both good. One person ordered the sate pho. It's different but good as well. We didn't order the noodles or bun. If you're a visitor of Calgary, this restaurant has good pho. It didn't get a five star because it's missing some condiments such as vinegar onions."}
{"text":"We came here around noon and the restaurant was about 70% full.  There were wings special (8 pieces for $5) which were quite decently priced especially since the wings were so delicious.  It came in 3 flavors: bbq, salt and pepper and honey garlic.  I personally like salt and pepper but my boyfriend prefers saucy wings so we opted for the honey garlic.  To our surprise the sauce came on the side so I was able to have my salt and pepper goodness.  We had the pho (#11) and the vermicelli (#10B) both were fresh tasting and delicious.  However, I did find the fish sauce a bit too sweet.  I love my fish sauce but I prefer it to not taste like candy.  Either way, it's likely me just being picky.  My boyfriend on the other hand, really enjoyed the fish sauce and claimed that he could drink it."}
{"text":"Both the food and service are good, the price is unbeatable. Nothing beats a good bow of hot pho during the cold Canadian winter. Will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food although it is a pretty small place so seating for more than 4 would be a bit of a wait.  Even with the four of us on a Friday night at 7:30 we had to wait almost 25 minutes for a table.    But it was worth it.  The regular beef pho and the satay beef pho were really tasty.  The broth was very nice although I'm sure they must use msg also but probably not as much as others in town.   The noodles for the soup were cooked just right so they weren't mushy.   And the satay actually ptasted peanutty.   The appetizers of chicken fried wings and the prawns were really good.  Our son really liked the chicken wings and said he could have just had two orders for supper and he'd be good!   They do contain condensed milk somehow so watch out if you have allergies to dairy. The one disappointing dish was fried noodles and seafood.  The noodles were limp and the sauce was not inspiring.  We had saw someone else order a fried noodle with beef that looked way better.  It was the deep fried crispy kind that looked like a nest egg with meat on it.  Next time. So great place for Vietnamese so you don't have to go all the way into Forest Lawn."}
{"text":"Sate pho is to die for.  Great prices.  Large portions. Bun bo hue is also delicious if you like shrimp paste."}
{"text":"One of my favorite standards for consistently good local pho. I'm no expert but they always deliver what I like.  Their sate beef or chicken pho is always spicy enough (I like proper spicy) with the right flavor of meat.  I had their wor wonton soup today for the first time and it was delicious."}
{"text":"9.95 for a large bowl of pho, definitely could be an \"XL\" in other Vietnamese restaurants here in Calgary. The portions, and the meat variety is pretty great for the value. However, it got really salty about 5 minutes in (that's without adding sauce) the place is comfortable considering the size, just gets stuffy when it gets busy. The service is better than most Vietnamese restaurant too, seems it caters to more westernized patrons."}
{"text":"I walked in about 3pm for a take out. Ray, welcomed me like family. Ordered one chicken over rice and one beaf over noodles. 2-Bubble tea's. All were delicious!! Ray, helped me to my car as I had my purse, my doggie and the 2 bubble tea's and the 2 meals. It was very appreciated. Great friendly people!! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Pho Huong Viet is my go to Vietnamese restaurant. Quick service, ample portions, good prices and, most important, quality food.  I'd say 90% of the time I order the spicy sate beef pho. A large portion is served in what I would normally consider to be a mixing bowl. Unless you have a giant appetite, I recommend the smaller size.  From time to time, I'll partake in the chicken sub or the charbroiled pork vermicelli, both solid dishes.  The service is a bit abrupt, but given the volume of customers this location gets, I appreciate that the staff are economical in their interactions as this allows more people to dine in over the course of the day."}
{"text":"Not the easiest place to find...but once you do, it's absolutely worth it. A tiny little place with huge portions of food. I will happily return any time I'm in Calgary. Order anything, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great broth in the Pho Bo very tasty. The meat is over cooked and defiantly not medium rare as described. The large portion is a very large size and good value for money. Also tried the Bun Combo 4 with Chicken, shrimp, beef and spring rolls. Was tasty and a good size portion. I would recommend the Pho to people of the two on the grounds of value for money and I really liked the soup. Also you pay at the register and not at your table. You may sit there a while if you think the bill/cheque arrives to the table."}
{"text":"Great food, but they really need to learn how to run a kitchen.  Consistently, one person's meal comes out long before the other person's meal, what's with that. Very embarrassing for a couple at a table.  Just plain amateur."}
{"text":"I would give them a solid 3.5 star rating if I could. We had our doubts about the quality of the food here since the north end isn't known for its stellar dining options but decided to check it out based on the other reviews. Pleasantly surprised. Great spot for a quick lunch or simple fast dinner. Not the nicest of places as far as decor is concerned but clean and able to accommodate a fair number of diners. The portion sizes are insane. The bowl of noodles was bigger than the size of my head and far too much for me to finish. That's the main reason I'm not giving them 4 stars. Because the food doesn't keep/reheat well, I consider this a bit of a waste and I did find the amount of food rather overwhelming. Everything was tasty though and very fresh. Service was very fast and attentive, to the point where we felt they checked on us a few too many times. Overall, good experience. Would probably get take-out next time so I can take my time trying to polish it off and/or we can split a portion."}
{"text":"very tender meats and the right amount of spice.  I dont need 10 peppers!  I havnt been working in a coal mine all day and lost all sense of taste or smell!!!    That being said it was very yummy, the soups with mild spicey and the lemongrass beef/chickens and the bbq pork all very very good with nice servings of vegetables.  There could have been a bit more meat on the plates, but maybe thats just because the last few days I've been having montreal swartz smoked meat sammich's with imported smoked meats from montreal with just bread and mustard.  spring rolls are authentic and the wontons deep fried are decent.  The only reason its not a 5 is the space is tiny, they definitly need airconditioning and to hire more staff in peak times.  The amount of food you get is definitly worth every penny.  Spend 100$ and you will feed a family of 10 sumo.  I would have liked a personal server who waited on me hand on foot, but seems they are too busy and maybe because there is a communal tip jar, which i loathe, so the workers dont see much reason in excellent service."}
{"text":"My husband and I have become regulars here, and with good reason: the food is delicious, the servings are generous, the prices are great.  Always busy, but they do a good job of turning things over. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"The Beef Sate Soup is the best (in Calgary). The large is big enough for two, the spice is mild, and the ingredients are fresh AF.  Get it."}
{"text":"It's a tiny place in Ranchlands. Portions are generous for the price. The broth is okay for pho. The meat portions are large. The decor is modern and they keep he place clean. They are Chinese owned but good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Love their Bun Bo Hue and fish cake:) Service is good but one waitress is not friendly likes others."}
{"text":"If you want a large bowl of delicious, flavorful and spicy soup; have the sate chicken noodle pho. I asked for more vegetables and less noodles and they said no problem. You must go to this Vietnamese restaurant. I thought I had tasted the best Pho in Edmonton but I am glad I moved.  We arrived for lunch on a Tuesday at 11:30 and it was not busy but was filling up quickly . We were served promptly. The food was served hot, as it should be.  My wife had deep fried spring rolls and vegetables on vermicelli. She enjoyed it but could have had a few more vegetables.  It is a very happy bustling place. We were not rushed at all. Another plus is that we had no problem parking close by. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The satay pho is amazing. I crave it all the time. It has a good level of spiciness to it and, while I'm pretty weak in being able to handle spicy food, I still order it because it's that good.  I'm so glad I don't have to go all the way to Forest Lawn for good satay pho anymore!  Also, note that they are closed Mondays. I found that out the hard way."}
{"text":"Was traveling for business and a friend took me here for a Sunday lunch, even though he had not been here before. Line was out the door, so we figured that was a good sign and decided to wait. They were quick to bus tables once customers left and we were seated fairly quickly, given the line.   The food was delicious. Had the beef pho, pork with vermicelli noodles, salad spring rolls, deep fried spring rolls and shrimp-on-a-skewer.  Everything was delicious.  To top it off, the prices were very reasonable.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were on our way back from Banff and had some time before heading to the airport. We were craving for some Vietnamese food and thanks to yelp, we found a winner! The place was pretty busy at lunch time but we were lucky to get a table. The menu is pretty big with soup, vermicelli bowls, and rice plates.   I ordered the chicken curry soup (comes in large size only--I learned this the hard way) and salt and pepper chicken wings as an app. The wings were juicy yet crispy. My chicken curry soup came as a large (little didn't I know! I only wanted a small). The soup however was super flavorful. It was loaded with chicken, noodles, and potatoes. If I wasn't going to the airport I would've loved to take my leftovers to go.   Very good Vietnamese spot to get a quick but tasty meal!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, great pho, average service. My favourite pho place ever. Also very cheap!"}
{"text":"One of our go to places for Vietnamese food. It's a hole in the wall small space where you can always expect a line, but we leave satisfied every time. Great value, delicious food and quick service."}
{"text":"Straight up, the best place for Pho in the NW. This is part of a trio of restaurants owned by three brothers and the original place on 17th avenue is a busy bustling place with good service and even better food.  They recreated it in this rather tiny location (I wish they would expand) and has quickly caught on as the most popular place for Vietnamese food in the NW! The place is always full (due to the limited seating) so the pick-up orders are always coming in. Pho, Bahn Mi, Vermicelli, Rice whatever you like you can have here. Considering the dynamic menu the food is always quite tasty and arrives fresh and hot!   Portions are good, prices are good, service has to be good (such a small place) and just all around the place to go for Viet food. We have gone often enough that the owners recognize us and the one time when our food came out really bland (maybe chef was having a bad day?), they personally tasted the food and brought out extra stuff for us.   So yeah, aside from the small space (I've mentioned it a few times eh?) this is a great place to drop by for Vietnamese food. The end."}
{"text":"All i ordered was the strawberry fruit smoothie with no pearls, sugar and puree, and have to say it tasted fresh and healthy, without the sweetness.  One of the cleaner pho places you'll find, out in this mini-plaza out in the burb."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant! Food is very tasty, portions are generous and price is good. This place is busy, you have to be prepare to wait until a table becomes available,   Also, don't plan to spend a lot of time after you have finished eating... you might see customers still waiting for tables and feel a tiny bit of pressure. You can also order as take out if you don't have the time to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Vietnamese places in Calgary and was certainly busy enough to prove it. We waited ten minutes for a table, but it was peak dinner rush - so we didn't mind. The food arrived quickly and was fresh and tasty. The portions are big and I had the vermicelli bowl with shrimp and fried fish cake, and substituted veggie spring rolls instead of pork. Also had the hot lemon and honey drink which was delicious. Overall I give it 3.5 - 4 stars. The restaurant wasn't quite as clean as I would have liked - oily menu and dirty water glass. Also the waiting area is tiny so chances are good you'll be outside in the cold if there's a line up. Take out seemed very popular and might be a good option for those in a hurry or not wanting to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This place has great food. The only problem with that is that the place gets so packed the servers cannot keep track of who was in the door when and how long they've been waiting. If you don't speak up they will seat people with the same party size and skip right over you. Then when you do get seated after speaking up, the servers give you dirty looks."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at. Their food is great, big servings at a lower price compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. Will definitely come back and recommend."}
{"text":"I am in love with Pho #1.  It says mildly spicy , I would say that is accurate.  The broth was incredibly flavorful, the beef perfectly tender and the noodles were, well perfect.  I needed a Pho fix and I got one - I ate the whole bowl and then lifted it to drink the broth at the end.  I also only spent 9.36 CAD for the small (lol) Pho and a large pot of jasmine tea.    As I type this, I am sitting at Pho Huong while the very nice cashier calls me a taxi.  And he offered me another pot of jasmine tea for free while I wait.  The service to this point was efficient but friendly, it just jumped up to amazing."}
{"text":"****update****  The last four times we've eaten here, we've found hair in our food. I'm willing to let this slide once or twice but it is becoming consistent, always the same inch long white or black hair. Seems like it's coming from one person....I just can't anymore"}
{"text":"Portion sizes are crazy big!  Had a seafood soup with veggies added and was thoroughly satisfied.  We will go again for sure."}
{"text":"Today I had the worst Vietnamese food of my life :-)) How can you burn the destroy a food as easy as seafood noodles, is beyond me."}
{"text":"I've only had the pho here, and it was exactly as it should be (I'm struggling to find more to say about it).  I will return for it, but am also inclined to try one of their vermicelli bowls or rice dishes (the menu is quite extensive) next time, since they looked excellent.  Along with the food itself, everything else was satisfactory: service was prompt and friendly, the place was clean and comfortable (it may be fairly new), and prices were reasonable.  One issue here might be parking in the middle of the day, as it's located in a busy strip mall, but it's probably not a big problem."}
{"text":"This place is really good! I actually had no idea it existed, despite frequenting this strip mall regularly. After finding out that my favourite, Bowness Vietnamese, was closed, we headed over here. I was impressed at how nicely decorated and neat it was inside, especially for being in a strip mall. It wasn't too busy so we sat down immediately and ordered right away. I decided on the Beef Satay soup and my boyfriend had the Vermicelli bowl, which was HUGE! I don't think I've seen a bigger portion of that meal, which was great because I love having leftovers. My soup was really tasty and delicious, although I'll admit that it doesn't beat the Peanut Satay at Bowness Vietnamese! Food was great, the portions were HUGE, and the price was perfect. Since it's so close, I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is my go to place when I'm starving and when I crave south eastern Asian food. Their meals have huge proportions and are really cheap for what you get. The B4 meal (forgot the actual name) is my absolute favourite. The flavour is incredible. It's like heaven in my mouth. I definitely recommend this place. My only complaint is that the restaurant is quite small so wait times to get a seat can take some time, but the wait is worth it when you get served their great food."}
{"text":"Good solid vietnamese close to home. Clean interior, great broth, friendly staff. Booths are small, but we were seated promptly. Will definately return! Weird 1990s r and b music, had me singing along. Why do I know the words to all those songs?"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious - portions were generous. I'd say coming from this part of Canada, this is pretty authentic Vietnamese food. It was so good. We ordered a hot coffee with a chicken noodle soup and the pork vermicelli with spring rolls. Geez, wish we had this in DC."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese in the city! Price and taste wise. Have patience with the waiters, they're busy for a reason."}
{"text":"This probably my favourite Vietnamese place! We eat here way to much. Favourite's: spicy chicken soup, vermicelli with chicken and beef! It's small but always busy, takeout is really fast and affordable. Never had an issue with them!"}
{"text":"Whenever we have a craving for Vietnamese food - we come to this great little place off of 17th Ave and close to Westbrook mall area.  On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, my sister in law and I really enjoy the chicken curry soup with coconut milk.  It also has chunks of sweet potatoe/ yam in it which we really enjoy.  Their soups are huge huge bowls which I'm sure you can split with a friend.  I can barely finish the large soup and end up having to take the leftovers home !  This place is a favorite with a lot of people and if you stop by at lunch time - be prepared to wait for a seating.  If you have several in a group , I would make reservations.  The place is always packed and the food is always huge portions and delicious.  I never see large bowls of soup this size in Chinatown or any other place.  And the price is very reasonable as well.  Go try this great restaurant !"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the perfect broth then look no further! Get the pho Sate, deep rich flavourful broth and a huge portion. It is the best soup I have ever tried. Get the large it is literally big enough for two, or take some home. Amazing prices too! This place is always busy so you know it's the best."}
{"text":"Just got to Calgary and we were looking for somewhere good and quick. This place had wonderful portions for a great price! The food was amazing! I got the chicken pho and it was perfect for a rainy cold day!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Fresh, hot and delicious. This place is not fancy but the food is what makes it. Great spring rolls and something for everyone - bowls, sate, fun drinks for kids."}
{"text":"My takeout chicken satay sub turned out to be beef!  After, I had repeatedly emphasized chicken on the phone.  Also MSG was extra strong."}
{"text":"First went to this place when another we wanted to go to was closed a couple months ago. First thing we noticed was a line out the door, definitely a good sign!  Every time I've gone, this place has been full. The service is like a 2/5, they don't bring you anything you don't specifically ask for, just bring you water to drink and don't really offer anything else, even though there's a full page of drinks in the menu. You have to go up to the counter to pay, they don't bring you your bill.   The food though, so good! First time I went, I had a vermicelli bowl with chicken and beef, and it was really good! The pho is 10/10, we always go here for pho now. Spicy pho can definitely be on the spicy side, so watch out for that! We went again yesterday and I had the tofu and veggie curry, also 10/10, not too spicy, good flavour though, even though the veggies were cut a little too big I thought.   Love this place, will keep going back for the food even despite the service."}
{"text":"Review: dinner.  Bottomline: great Vietnamese food at a great price. It doesn't get better than this in Calgary. Restaurant is small and is often busy so make sure to make a reso.  Atmosphere: Pho Huong Viet is a busy restaurant tucked away in a professional strip mall in Ranchlands. It's pretty small so it's not meant to host big parties. I frequent this Vietnamese restaurant and I have to say the place is always packed with people. It can be a bit cramped inside at times but service is always fast.  Food: awesome Vietnamese food all across the board. Their pho is great. Their vermicelli bowl is great. Their stir fry is great. I have yet to be disappointed with any of their dishes. If you have an Asian palate much like mine then order the lemongrass stir fry noodles. It's to die for.  Value: the prices are fantastic for the quality and quantity of food you get. It's a place that I will continue to frequent for as long as they are serving the same tasty food."}
{"text":"very very reasonable price! they are big and not expensive.   The food was okay but the grilled shrimps I had were too salty.   Service was not very good, they put me into the most weird spot, and the staffs kept chatting and chatting. Oh! and I saw a waiter using cooking knife to open a dirty box (shipment) , I do mind people using kitchen tools not for food!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the variety of their menu and it is always busy.  It's a convenient location and the service is quick.  It's not my go-to place but we do frequent there if our other place is closed.  Prices are great and portions are big.    I just enjoy the Viet Sub place much more!"}
{"text":"Food is not great, service is terrible. Rude staff, waited over 30 minutes for a to go order. When I finally got back to my house I discovered that they had only given me the broth for my pho, no beef, no noodles. Will not patronize this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"This is your pretty typical Vietnamese restaurant.  It's got all the usual stuff like pho, vermicelli, and rice dishes, and for a pretty average price.  There really isn't anything too extraordinary about Pho Huong, but it's a great restaurant to eat at.  I would recommend sitting in though.  Once I got delivery, but the food arrived pretty cold and it took quite some time.  I prefer sitting down and taking my time with my warm, fresh food.  The people at Pho Huong are usually pretty nice too.  They aren't overly enthusiastic, but they don't shun or snub you either.  They seem happy that you are choosing their establishment and show it with gracious smiles.  If you're in the area, Pho Huong Viet is a good place to enjoy a nice Vietnamese meal.  I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to eat here though.  It's not that astonishing, just a classic family restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is not bad.  The pho broth is a clear and tasty broth.  Bun bo hue is extremely spicy.  Be careful!   I can eat spicy and when I say it's hot, I truly mean it!    Their bun is your usual vermicelli with all the goodies but the garnish is not crushed peanuts but fried onion chips.  The portion is quite huge.    The restaurant is quite small and squashy so be aware of that."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite place to get Vietnamese food in Calgary! When I lived in the NW I was a regular here. It's quite the drive for me now but whenever I'm in the area I try to go. So good!   It's usually pretty busy but definitely worth the wait. Great for takeout too."}
{"text":"Anyone who got something bad to say on this restaurant is high as a kite and doesnt know value. Go here like once week"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, great food, and at a great price  Hmm, isn't that what we all really want from a restaurant?  This is my go-to place in the NW. Portions are large. Everything is tasty. It's a small space but worth the short wait if there is a line-up.  Check this place out if you are jonesing for some PHO"}
{"text":"Solid Vietnamese. I grew up in the NE of Calgary where there are Pho restaurants on every corner. I always judge a Vietnamese restaurant by their broth. This place does it right. Small space but, worth the wait."}
{"text":"Looks rather filthy outside. Like, seriously dirty. Inside it's a bit better, and service is nice - so things start to improve once you are seated.  Tightly crowded chairs and tiny tables, scratched water glasses, touristi-sh decor - all the usual stuff...  Menu is typical hundreds of options, boiling down to \"soup or plate, noodles or rice, beef or chicken\". Rest is veggies.  But pretty yummy, actually - not bad at all! Not like to crave and charge to this corner for this food, but nothing wrong if you've ended up inside - portions are decent, price is okay, and food is good."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favourite Pho place in the city.  I tend to order the grilled beef and rice vermicelli everywhere I go, and Huong Viet's is the best.   The beef is so well flavoured, and comes with grilled onions with it.  This takes the flavours up a notch IMO.  Nice service, the place is always busy with a wide variety of clientele."}
