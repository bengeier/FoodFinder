{"text":"My first visit. The gyro sandwich #1 with a salad. The place was clean, even the restroom was clean. The food was fresh and properly prepared. The flavors all popped like I expected from the Tzatziki sauce to the Tahini sauce and all the fresh greens. I'll be going back for sure.

The staff was friendly, helpful and knowledgable when I asked about ingredients and how things were prepared. The Tzatziki BTW is made on site daily.

I remove my hat and take a knee, you have made a fan of me."}
{"text":"This place has the freshest and tastiest chicken souvlaki I've ever had! Great Greek salads and hummus to go along with the combo plates as well. The pita bread was warm and fresh. This is a definite must if you're a fan of Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I attended an event \"Meet Me in the Mediterranean\" and King of Gyros catered in the food. It was truly AMAZING (and I'm a picky eater)!! I enjoyed every bite. Definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite Gyro Place from all. I like these guys menu, food is delicious, price is reasonable. I brought all my family to this place and now they constantly visit it. Thanks for the great food right near my work place!!!"}
{"text":"King of Gyros is the best gyro spot in the valley.  Their meats are phenomenal, the salads are fresh (their house dressing is delicious) and the restaurant is always clean.  I highly recommend trying it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"It took me awhile to try this place. The strip mall storefront doesn't draw you in but what a great spot. It is frequently on my lunch rotation. The food is healthy and full of flavor, portions are large and reasonably priced, lots of choices and the service is fast. The staff is always pleasant. The only minus is everyone has figured out how great this little place is. It would be nice if they had a line to pick up to go phone orders. Glad to see another successful small business."}
{"text":"Completely hit my craving for gyro meat. A huge plate of meat was just 5 bucks! Greek salad was delicious and a generous portion. Tzatziki was perfect, thick, yogurt-y and so flavorful. Service was excellent. The owner was cooking with 2 employees and was fun to chat with. Hole in the wall flavor without the sketchy location, appearance and greasy odor. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We tried the regular gyros and the falafel pita. Both were very tasty and the pita was also really nice. The falafel could have used a little bit more sauce, but they gave us extra tzaziki. They also have a delicious spicy chili sauce on the tables - give it a try!"}
{"text":"Walked in here on accident and glad I did!! Lots of choices here. I got the beef plate. Comes with meat, pita bread, veggies, side salad AND choice of humans, rice, or fries. I got the rice. Portion was huge. The pita bread was fresh. The service was great and friendly. This place will become a new fav!"}
{"text":"Fast service, great traditional gyros, very good chicken shawarma, and tasty tzatziki sauce. Can get busy at lunch."}
{"text":"Been going here with the family for about a year now and we always see a bunch of returning customers. I love this place. The portions are good, prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious. I usually go with the chicken shawarma plate with hummus, pita, and salad. The staff here are always friendly and down to help with any special requests. If you're on the fence, go here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best gyro in town! Best menu, great service. 
Dennis is the man!


Great Mediterranean and Greek food."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I used to go to Mika's a lot but they're a little overpriced, so... I tried this place out. I wanted the chicken gyro but they were sold out, so I got the chicken shawarma pita with a salad. Because they were out of the chicken gyro, they threw some baklava in for free!  The pita was awesome with plenty of tzaziki and the salad was good too. The baklava was amazing!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!! So friendly and food is amazingly fresh!! Big portions that I use for dinner or lunch next day. Great flavors and very clean environment!!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try, I had the chicken gyros, and a chicken salad. Let me just say it was not worth my $15 spent. Portillos is much better, it's as close to home (Chicago) for me than I've had yet!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! One hell of a chef they have.  The best food in Arizona, Ive only tried a few things on the menu so far but I loved everything I got.  I live 45 minutes away and I'll make the drive to eat here a lot more. I'd also like to add that they have great customer service."}
{"text":"This place is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! King of Gyros has the best taste of Mediterranean this side of the globe. I eat there often for lunch, so naturally when I hosted a Mediterranean themed party of 60, they were my first and only choice.  The food is always seasoned perfectly, the pita is always soft the way I like it.  Their hummus is amazing and they honestly have the best pistachio baklava I've ever tasted. 

This is a family owned business and it's run like a well oiled machine!"}
{"text":"love this place !!!! Great salads , my fav is the Cesar with chicken"}
{"text":"I have known this place since last year but never visit. Finally my husband and i decided to come here today. I did not expect this place until i had my first bite of chicken souvlaki. Oh my gosh!!  Best chicken souvlaki and kind price. Cant wait until my next visit here."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've ever had! The meat was tender, flavorful and a generous portion. The tzatziki sauce was delicious. Not runny like most places. The prices were good too. Under $9 for a gyro, fries and drink. Not bad for a fresh hot meal. 

I only interacted with the cashier. He was pleasant. There is a full view of the kitchen an it seemed everyone was working well together. I love watching the meat carver being the carnivore I am. 

I'll be back to taste more of the menu selections. So much to choose from."}
{"text":"King Gyro is the bomb!  Gyros, salads and desserts are so tasty!  Very clean relaxing friendly place!"}
{"text":"The service was great, they were very helpful with my large order for a production shoot.

Food was really good, I'd go back more often if it was closer to where I lived/worked."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Greek places I have eaten at. They are all super friendly and the food is delicious. The gyro meat had lots of flavor and they are very generous portions. I want to come back and try some of the other options."}
{"text":"I love Greek and I thought the prices were a little high for what I got. The falafel wasn't as good other places whose prices were cheaper for the side. Probably won't come back here again"}
{"text":"Great place, quick service. I've eaten here 3 or 4 times and have taken out over a dozen times. Try the 2 meat combo plate."}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean food in Tempe and Chandler

Friendly staff, Love this place."}
{"text":"I have loved falafel pitas as long as I can remember & wanted a simple familiar dish. Thinking a falafel might me light lunch fair I stopped in with my 3 daughters.
  I ordered the falafel pita combo & chose a Greek salad instead of fries. My older daughters ordered the kids hot dog & chicken strips.
  When the food was finished the servings were quite large. Full size hot dog & 3 large piping hot chicken strips for the kids. Both came with a reasonable serving of crinkle cut fries. The Greek salad was large enough to make a light meal out of by itself. Lots of dark green lettuces, cucumber slices, & too few tomatoes. Topped with Feta crumbles & a bit too much dressing (definitely ordering light on the dressing or on the side next time) and a single un-pitted black olive (it deserved friends). The falafel was stuffed with some unexpected ingredients including herbed & roasted broccoli, sugar snap peas, & onions. I prefer green falafel to the fresh fried red variety they serve with a distinctly Indian flavor but it was very well made. I most missed Tahini sauce which I usually order extra but doesn't appear on their version of falafel at all probably because it wouldn't complement the veggies as well.
  Overall we all will return to try more of their bargain priced menu."}
{"text":"Very good customer service, the quality of the food was very good, the restaurant very clean and that include the restroom."}
{"text":"The gyros were just ok.  Freshly cooked, nice huge portion of gyro meat, accompanied by a good-sized portion of perfectly cooked crinkly french fries.  I've had many a gyro pita sandwich in my life and for me, this was just average, and maybe even a little bit on the salty side and very stingy on the tzatziki.  On the plus side, the staff is friendly and helpful, and some of their other entrees looked appetizing.  Next time I am in the area, I might try the chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"This place is TBE. Everything is always fresh and super good, and at decent price. So happy I discovered this gem of a place. Don't eat any other Greek food trust me! You'll have to search high n low for a place that's as good as this one."}
{"text":"Oh man! So great. Can I give them 6 stars?? Friendly staff, casual atmosphere, incredibly delicious food, and fair prices. I got a chicken plate & my bf had the firehouse gyro. The plate came with a big greek salad, humus, pita, veggies and a drink. Tons of food. I couldn't even finish it with my bf's help so I happily packed my leftovers into a doggy-bag for later. We were making plans to come back before we even finished our meal!"}
{"text":"Totally impressed with the food here...everything we ate was wonderful. I honestly can say the best gyro I've ever had. More than recommend this for a quick and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Have been looking for really good gyros since Cypress Grill closed and found this place through Yelp.  Tried the gyro, chicken gyro and onion rings and extremely happy with all, so King of Gyros is a go-to when craving Meditteranean food.  Tried Pitta Souvli but didn't think their gyro meat was as flavorful...so will drive a little further for really flavorful gyros @ KoG!"}
{"text":"Very good, fresh, quick meal. I had gyro Greek salad, wife had chicken Greek salad. Just a little too vinegar for me but wife said \"that's Greek\". Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you love a good Chicago Gyro, this is the place to go! We had the picado and fire fighter both were amazing. Next time we are adding a pizza puff to the order."}
{"text":"Great food. Flavor filled Shawarma is an awesome pick. Everything here from soup to salad is nice and it is cheap. Generally little crowded in the evening as they close by 8 so head early !!! Their pizza pocket is a bomb full of flavor and a must try !!!  We do regularly take out from KOG and they never disappoint!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner. We had the gyro pita combo. It was really good!  The owners were very nice and welcoming. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!   Best gyro since I was in Greece.  Found this place on yelp when we were shopping in the area.   A simple fast food type of place serving excellent gyros."}
{"text":"Awesome Gyros and falafel. Great atmosphere, wonderful staff and always a happy crowd of people. This is our new go to spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of dishes and the gyros are incredibly good. There's a lot of value for a really delicious meal. If you're getting a salad I recommend asking for the dressing on the side. It's very sour and they tend to put a lot.

Other than that this place is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I have been twice now with friends and it's now a new staple :) The food is fresh and authentic. Having been to Greece and enjoying the food there, I can def attest to this :) Thank you King of Gyros!"}
{"text":"I finally found the best gyros in Arizona after 10 years of looking, thank god!!! Amazing food!!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place!    The Schwarma is amazing!  Best I've ever had.   Great service, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews, and thought we would try it out. Food was fabulous. Chicken shawarma and Greek fries absolutely delicious. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"By far the best pita bread I have ever had! All of the food was delicious! Will definitely be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot (gets crowded).  Chicken Shawarma is top-notch.  Only complaint is that it is always cold in there (door open + fans blowing on cool day)."}
{"text":"The King of Gyros is the absolute monarch of Mediterranean food and undisputed ruler of the Tempe Middle Eastern Cuisine Kingdom.

In fact their Steak Shawarma was so nice I ate it twice--in less then 24 hours.  The second time was even better than the first with my side upgraded to the gluttonously good Greek fries.

What really sealed the deal though was the awesome in-house hot sauce.  Just the right amount of spicy without too much burn.

Coupled with all that, the value and the service make this place a solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"It's good value for the money and the flavored in the gyro are very good.   I'll go back again."}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!  This place is great.  The food comes out warm and flavorful. We ordered a gyro salad, kabobs, jalapenos poppers and gyro sandwich. 

The salad was delicious but I would suggest to order extra sauce with it.  The kabobs were tender and flavorful.  The poppers were hot and fresh from the fryer.  (Frozen premade  poppers).  The fries and crinkle cut and crispy.  The Gyro sandwich was good as it comes with lots of meat.  I would suggest to ask for extra sauce as well.  Plus the tomato is put on the pita first so the hot meat will make it soft and mushy.  I didn't mind but you may have a different preference."}
{"text":"I was in Arizona this passed week and thought I'd give this king gyros a try since the other location was beyond great. Same amazing satisfaction and quality. This has to be my favorite restaurant when I'm on vacation."}
{"text":"First time here and I really like it.  the food is little bit salty for my taste but it was delicious. They have a large serving portion, everyone is very friendly. I love that they have so many selections of tea to choose from , since I don't like soda that is a plus for me."}
{"text":"Best gyros! Best tzatziki sauce! Best pita! Definitely a must. The food is full of flavor, fresh and delicious. It's our new favorite."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Great food, large portions and super casual. Perfect for lunch or grab to go dinner."}
{"text":"All their stuff on the menu is delicious. So full of flavor. You can walk in right before close which is something I hate doing but they don't rush you out the door. Their hospitality is so welcoming and friendly. Seriously one of my favorite restaurants in Tempe. Quick service, amazing food, all the staff is friendly, and the owner takes a lot of pride in his customer service!!! Come here its great. Kid friendly too!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing gyros!  The employees are all very friendly.  I had a gyro with the French fries and then also ordered one to go for a co-worker back at the office.  They waited until I was almost done with my gyro before bringing out the to go order so that my co-worker would have a warm gyro when I got back.  The fries are kind of bland, next time I'll get the Greek salad as my side option.  I'm going to have a hard time now when I'm in this area deciding between this place and the famous cheesesteak place in the same complex."}
{"text":"Our last night in town and decided to try this little place. I ordered the appetizer sampler, subbing baba ghanoush for tabouleh. Husband had beef souvlaki with a Greek salad. There was a bit of miscommunication with the cashier that resulted in hubby being served chicken instead of beef, but the owner/manager guy quickly apologized and brought him the correct order. Food tasted great. I really enjoyed the hummus and tabouleh. The falafel was also good, and the dolmas came in last for my personal preference. I've just never been a big fan of them. The tzaziki sauce was tasty and went well with everything. Husband really enjoyed his beef dish and we both made sure to thank the staff for quickly fixing the original issue and giving such a nice flavorful meal. Overall I'd go back again!"}
{"text":"OMG live in Tucson and this is my new go to place when I come to Phoenix. They have the best Gyro's ever. Restaurant is clean and prices are great. Go here, it's the bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! I ordered the combo platter (shawarma and kefta) and it was unbelievable. The flavor on the shawarma was spot on and the kefta was prepared to perfection!! I always go with the rice and I love the fact that they top it with sumac! I drive from central phoenix just to eat at this place! If you like greek food, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I've been in Arizona for almost a year and i was looking for a good gyro place and fell upon King of Gyro! The lady at the register was very friendly and welcoming. She recommended the chicken shawarma sandwich. When I received my sandwich i was surprised on how much chicken was in the sandwich! There was a pretty good amount where every bite was filled with chicken. The seasoning of the chicken was delicious as well! Not only was the food amazing, the place was clean and well kept up! Overall i would definitely come back and i will be sure to recommend this place to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Awesome gyros!! Best in the area!! Salads are awesome too!! They are not shy with the meat!!"}
{"text":"Always fresh. Great salads and gyro plates.  Eggplant dip and hummus always fresh and tasty. Friendly service."}
{"text":"AZ is known for having some of the best middle eastern  food so when I saw this place right now next to my work I was excited to try it! I called in my order as soon as they opened at 10am and the guy who took my order was rude, didn't tell me how long it would take or anything. Once I got there the same guy who took my order came up rudely told me my total while being on his iPhone on a call. He continued to be on a phone call while I paid him and got my food and my drink and came back to work only to find a bad smell coming either the chicken or yellow rice, I ordered the chicken shawarma plate with rice and it had the kind of smell of food just beginning to go bad. I figured it was probably a smell of some spices they might've used so I started eating it. Conclusion: the chicken was under cooked and didn't taste anything like your typical chicken shawarma mixed in with some broccoli and green beans which is odd bc I don't think any Mediterranean place sells their chicken shawarma sautéed with broccoli, it tasted really bad. The rice was dripping with oil and gave me really bad heartburn. Needless to say I had to get pepto-b because I got sick from it. Ive been to places like haji baba princess and never tasted such weird Mediterranean food that was this bad, NOT SURE HOW THIS PLACE HAS 5 STARS
The only thing nice about this restaurant is their huge painting.... Sadly I won't be going there for lunch every again!"}
{"text":"This is great food. The meat is flavorful and the vegetables are very fresh. Service is great too!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love King of Gyros! Was doing some work in Chandler and said to myself \"Self... Sure could go for a Greek Salad with grilled chicken today!\" But where to go, where to go?

Turned to my trusty Yelp! app and found King of Gyros. Not certain how this place doesn't have 5-stars (What's up Yelpers in Phoenix?), but decided to give it a shot.

The line was short, the service was fantastic, and the salad... Heavenly! Best part... No Romaine lettuce so no salmonella poisoning for me!! 

Here's the rundown:

Satisfied? Yes
Return? Yes
Advocate? Yes"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this Greek yumminess!  I'm so sad I no longer work across the street because I miss getting lunch here!! The lentil soup is yummy along with everything I've tried!! The staff is very kind and it's very clean! I will definitely be stopping by when I'm on that side of town!"}
{"text":"Amazing Gyros, falafel and wings. Huge portions."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way home.  Menu is vast and options are plenty. Opted for the gyro with a side of mozzarella sticks. Very good food fresh and hot. Can't wait to try the other items the have.  

While waiting for the order I found the place to be very clean."}
{"text":"every time i'm in phoenix, i come here for lunch.  Really good food all around. Did a catering order to and fed 25 people for 220 bucks."}
{"text":"WOW! Really Really good! Tried for the first time and will definitely be back. So much meat it was actually FALLING out of my pita! First time having falafel and it was great! Glad I tried them."}
{"text":"Slow service, but the food was great! My fiance and I both got a gyro special, and it was one of the best gyro plates I've had in America."}
{"text":"Oh that delicious Greek Mediterranean culture food.  \"For the Greeks!!\" I absolutely love this place.  All of the food is great.  My favorite is the Chicken Solvaki salad or pita. Aka the \"Man\" salad.  My personal nickname because this salad could fill up an NFL offensive lineman.  Clean tender meat that is highly flavored. Decent priced.  Feta on everything.  Greek fries +3$ gyro meat is my cheat meal and is best of the best.  Fresh vegetables, rice, and humus.  I recommend this place to anyone who loves food of culture.  If not, there is an McDonalds down the street."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good! I had the kifta plate which included pita, some salad, humus, tzidiki & lentil soup. It was all way above average. My significant other had a gyros salad that was carved off a spit like it really should be. Not a large place and they do quite a business. You place your order and they call your number when it's done. I will definitely be back to try falafel and other choices"}
{"text":"I will definitely be back to this place.  I got the combo plate and it was delish, the meat was tender and very flavorful.  Prices were reasonable for the amount of food.  I could easily split the combo plate with someone and walk away perfectly satisfied. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place has the best gyros in town. Granted I've only been to a handful of places, but I was definitely impressed by the food here. The chicken gyro was less than $6, and it tasted super fresh and was loaded with plenty of meat and tzatziki. If you're really hungry, you can also get their traditional gyro along with a side (crinkle fries, salad, or soup) and a drink for about $8. They even have Code Red if you're a fan of that!

The location is a bit small, but very clean. You can also get 10% off with the Yelp check-in deal. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who appreciates a good gyro."}
{"text":"Was craving some gyro and decided to Yelp something and King of Gyros popped up so I thought I'd give it a try. Best decision made, hands-down. I tried their Chicken Shawarma and Steak Shawarma in their combo plate. It was served with rice and on top of that you get a Greek salad on the side. Let's just start by saving the meat was bursting of flavor and their portions were huge, I had enough for a second meal. 

They've got a loyal customer in me. I've never been disappointed with their service. To-go orders are always packed nicely and ready to go!"}
{"text":"Really glad we found this restaurant! From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted with a smile. Food was fantastic even the kids liked it, which says a lot they are slightly picky eaters. We were lucky enough to get to try a sample of their lentil soup which my boyfriend a likened to his fathers traditional soup back east.  We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"The food was delicious-I ordered the gyro plate with rice and substituted the salad for hummus. Price was awesome for what you're getting and they had great service, the guy at the register was really nice. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"You get a huge portion of food for your $. The 9.50 gyro plate gets you a ton of meat, pita, hummus, tzatziki sauce, and salad and drink. I'm so full. Staff is super friendly and restaurant is very clean. Will be back many times."}
{"text":"The best spot for gyros, Greek fires, and lentils soup! The owner and his family are very friendly! Our family loves coming here. Thank you king of gyros"}
{"text":"Outstanding gyros, love this place. It is my Greek restaurant of choice when I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"I have become obsessed with King Gyros. It's a problem.
I have cravings for the Chicken Schwarma plate on a daily basis. It is so delicious and I never want to anything ever again. The Tzatziki sauce is perfect. The Falafel is perfect. I am a huge fan."}
{"text":"I have dined here three times.  The high reviews brought me here and brought me back again to ensure I didn't miss something.  I guess Greek Fast Casual (GFC) is the current trend based on the number of higher rated reviews on Yelp across The Valley.  

I have taken the time to eat at four other highly rated GFC restaurants in the East Valley and I have found a common denominator: Kronos Meats.  Kronos is a 40-year-old company that produces Gyros meat and other products like Tzatziki Sauce and Hummus.  That said, there is a benefit in using premade meat: consistency.  The taste of each product served at most GFCs is very similar because of the use of Kronos products; if it doesn't taste good it can usually be attributed to overcooking the meat, or over-heating the pre-sliced meat.

Therefore, if you have an amazing Gyro or Kabob pita, it is probably because of proper preparation and handling; often, it is because of cutting corners such as using pre-sliced meat or pre-slicing the meat and keeping it in the warmer.  Not that is what I saw here at the King of Gyros, but I digress.  

The Beef and Beef/Lamb Options were tasty and moist; the best of which I experienced was the pork.  The portions are above average at King of Gyros compared to other GFCs, this includes being a bit heavy handed on the Feta Cheese used on multiple products as well as the \"Dressing\" on the Greek Fries.  Greek Fries are relatively straightforward: garlic, Feta, seasoning (olive oil, etc.) and salt atop French-fried potatoes, it is not too hard to get right, and when each component is in the proper proportion to the others, Greek Fries are amazing!  Unfortunately, The King does not get this right, the fries are swimming in what is best described as salad dressing, it is just not palatable (see posted photos).

The salads offered are also generous on the portions, however, they seem to suffer from the same overdressing as the fries.  Which is a shame because the product quality seems on the high side but it just cannot stand up to the barrage of oil & vinegar.  Another issue I, and my dining partners, experienced is some inconsistencies of the cook of meat.  On one visit, the Chicken Shawarma was moist and tender on a salad, yet dry and chewy on a pita, really? How did they do that?

I do appreciate the relatively quick service, even when it is busy.  I like that there is a drink tower and real brewed iced tea is offered; Pepsi fans will also be happy with the fountain selections.  On my first visit, the pictorial menu board proved tricky because of the close spacing between products and the placement of the description and price below the photo and the menu number above caused me to order a number seven when I thought I was ordering what was really a number four.  This happened again to a dining companion on another visit.  Perhaps a reprogramming is in order because the cashier admitted it happens often; not the worst thing, but a menu should be clear and concise as well as illustrative.

Overall, The King of Gyros is a solid 3.5 stars.  The food is good, the service is sufficient the prices are on par with the competition, but there is nothing that I experienced or ate that was memorable or would make me become a regular.  If you are in the area and you have a taste for Greek, The King of Gyros will fit the bill, but I have found other places that are worth the drive and are tastier.

{"text":"This place is great! Very authentic, family run business. Everyone here is so kind and welcoming. Their hummus is amazing. I always get their falafel plate. Some places make their falafel way too dry, but not here! And the portions are very generous. Definitely grateful to have King of Gyros so close to home! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, very nice staff, fair pricing and just a great place to eat at in general!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Greek place for years. Found this place, the food was tops. The portions are generous and the prices are right. We all have personal thoughts about what good tastes like so I can't advise exactly. But this is one place you should give a try if you haven't been there."}
{"text":"Got the gyro sandwich with all the toppings. This is the real deal. I should know being from Chicago and all! Lol. The gyro was just over $5, which I think is reasonable.  I didn't eat there,  but the to go service on  Saturday late morning was fast.  The dine in part looked very nice & clean.  Love the Chicago sky line on the wall. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Beef Schwarma pita was sooooo good. They use good cuts of beef! My sister got a chicken one, and it was a lil dry, but all the ingredients combined to create a delicious meal. Very impressed on my visit to this town. Service was quick too. The front door was a little heavy, but that is irrelevant to the review."}
{"text":"I came here because of the good reviews on yelp and was not disappointed. The gyro meat is very good and the portions are generous. 

Everyone was working hard and it seems to be a family run operation. 

My only suggestion is that the salt and pepper shakers could be wiped down more often."}
{"text":"Gyros sandwich was amazing!!  Tried to go back again and was so sad to see it was closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"Edit Dec 2017 - still the best gyro joint in the area.

There are a lot of Greek places around the S Tempe/E Ahwwtukee/W Chandler area, and I think I've tried them all. We consistently go back to KoG. The service is good and the food is great. The gyro is fantastic - tasty meat and plenty of it. Great value."}
{"text":"Seriously THE BEST gyro place around. The employees are extremely friendly, the restaurant is always super clean, and the food is not only DELICIOUS, but looks picture perfect (eating food that looks good is always an extra plus for me). I will definitely be a regular here, so glad I work right down the street. My only regret is that I wish I found this place earlier"}
{"text":"Found this little place on YELP. Turned out to be one of the best quick Greek restaurants I have been to in the country. Got the Supreme plate to share and more than enough meat for 2 people. Fantastic Gyro and grilled chicken. Side salad included in combo was fresh with feta, tomatoes, onions and olives and great dressing. Would keep this place on my go to list of lunch spots if I lived in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Long overdue update: King of Gyros (KOG) is as good as it gets IMHO for fast casual Greek food; when out and about KOG is always my pick for tasty, healthy choices served up by friendly folks who treat customers like royalty! Even when I dropped my lunch in the car park yesterday, I knew it would be delicious as always, and it survived pretty much intact because they pack it well
(I'm quite sure they would have replaced it, but my legendary clumsiness is no need to waste food:) 

Favorite menu items: chicken Souvlaki platter - a generous portion of marinated, grilled poultry - with their smooth and tangy hummus, and refreshing Greek Salad; the falafel which is never greasy sporting a pillowy, well seasoned interior; the dolmades adorned with quality olive oil and a bright lemon splash which brings those delicate grape leaves to life; and finally the lentil soup which I eat whenever I can, the spices add a warmth and depth I crave; their hot, fluffy pita is a perfect accompaniment. Scott thoroughly enjoys the gyros which are carved to order from a proper spit and is a fan of both the rice and fries, the aforementioned Greek salad and dolmades: he worked for years in a Greek diner in NY and is therefore picky about this cuisine, and loves it. 

KOG is family owned and operated, service is always with a smile, so welcoming. The kitchen is open, so you can watch your food being prepared, the dining area is clean, they offer beer, wine, soft drinks (bottles and fountain) and unsweetened fresh brewed iced tea which I love. At lunchtime they are very busy with local workers chowing down on reasonably priced and quick, delicious eats; ordering in advance can save some time. 

Wish: Avgolemono soup (I have been lobbying for them to make it for a year, but can't resist their bomb lentil soup!) 

Long live the King!!!

{"text":"Well now I have a real dilemma when I go to this place. For the 2 or 3 years I've been coming here I've always had their gyro pita because they are the best in town, but tonight I tried their Italian beef sandwich, and oh my was it good. I ordered it dipped, with giardiniera on top, and it was perfect. The bread was juiced, but not to soggy to hold up and eat. The meat was shaved thin and juicy like it should be, and the giardiniera had just the right spice note to it. 

I solved my dilemma by also getting a gyro salad, and having them put through meat on the side. Since the salad comes with a whole piece of pita bread I was able to make a gyro out of it using part of the salad. So actually this gives me two meals out of the deal. 

I must say thank you to the folks at King of Gyro's! I love your place even more than before now. This is a dilemma I don't mind having. I'll just have to visit more frequently now. Keep up the good work gang!"}
{"text":"Mmmm great gyros, tasty, ample portions and fresh!  The pita bread was soft and fresh.  At first it didn't look like there were any fresh vegetables on the gyro but they were hiding :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food! The manager reached out to me about my experience and invited me back to come try their food again. I had the Shwarma and it was great and flavorful. I highly recommend this place for your Greek fix. The customer service was awesome as well. Will b back."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot next to my office.  Both the food and people are great.  Can't wait for my next lunch here."}
{"text":"I have been going to their Phoenix location for the last decade, and I'm so excited there is now a King Gyros on the East side of town! This is simply the best Mediterranean food there is. The quality of their meats, indigents, and spices are what really makes this place amazing. Not to mention the sauce (you could literally eat it with anything on the menu). Same family owned atmosphere like the original with a modern twist. The customer service is always excellent time after time. The owner always remembers my orders, making my experience that much better. Everyone in the Tempe area needs to try this place asap, you will become a returning customer in no time. Can't say enough great things about King Gyros, the food really speaks for itself."}
{"text":"that place have everything you need. the have the great showarma and thini in tempe. the stuff is very friendly food is fresh always clean, generous portion.  food comes quick and ordering."}
{"text":"Much better with the new owners! Stop going when it was Gyro Express. The steak is tender, favorful. moist! Fresh salads! Hopefully they will maintain a godd consistantcy!!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the reviews indicate. The #3 beef gyro was limited with beef and the falafel was very dry, tasteless and salty. I am going very generous with the 3 stars I am giving. The employees seemed nice and there were TVs in the place to entertain us. But, overall, we were disappointed. Based on what the reviews said we expected much tastier food."}
{"text":"Such a fantastic spot for healthy, delicious, quick Greek food. I come here often as its close to me and every time I'm pleased!"}
{"text":"That's my salad in the top picture!! The other 2 I pulled from actual customers on Yelp. I've been here a lot and never had a problem until today. I tried to call about my salad in the hopes of getting it replaced or a refund and I was shot down with \" that's how the tomatoes are & we don't have red onions\"! Jeez you would think they would try to resolve it seeing I spent $17 in there but no!!! Surprised & will not go out of my way to drive there again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal gyros  The meat was so tender and the pita was fresh! I will definitely be back here, I agree it was one of the best gyros I have had"}
{"text":"Super nice people. Love the lentil soup. Big portions. Food is always great. Love the steak fries. Lunch time is pretty busy, its a good sign. Definitely enjoy the Chicago background and charm of the place. Tiny bit small and its fun maneuvering around the soda machine."}
{"text":"Great food! Big menu, lots of variety. Everything made with fresh good ingredients. Inexpensive, reasonably quick, given its cooked fresh. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"As natives of Chicagoland we are always looking for that chi town flavor.   This place nailed it.   Finally a real Kronos Chicago style gyro.   Clean and friendly place.    Best gyro I have had anywhere in Arizona, and I've been here for 8 years."}
{"text":"When you call yourself the king of gyros you are setting a high bar for yourself before somebody even steps in the door. However this spot makes a gyro that while not locking up the title of King clearly it certainly has a solid claim to the throne.

I came here late on a Saturday afternoon with my girlfriend for lunch and we were both pretty hungry so we went with the combo's with greek salad's. For $16 we got 2 filled to the brim with meat gyros, 2 salads, and 2 sodas. 

There isn't much to say about the salad, it's a greek salad with the usual fixings but what stood out was the peppers, cucumber and tomato all tasted fresh. Salads had a good mix of peppers, onions, cucumber and tomato so nothing dominated. Feta and dressing were standard fare.

The gyro's stood out. I got the fireman's gyro which is a standard gyro with giardiniera peppers (a nod to the heavy Chicago roots of this place). The first thing I noticed when presented with the gyro was just how much meat it had in it (having been freshly shaved to order from the spit). This thing was loaded with meat. The next thing was that the tzatziki was a thicker heavier version than the more smooth salad dressing kind most places, this was more of a spread or dip. It had great dill flavor and really complimented the meat. When taking a bite of this the flavors of the juicy meat with the spicy giardiniera and refreshing cooling flavors of the tzatziki was just perfect.

The place was clean and the staff friendly and personable. I also liked being able to see into the prep area with the spinning spits of chicken and gyro meat, it made my mouth water from the moment I walked in seeing the delicious and juicy meats. Watching them shave the gyro meat to order was a great way to showcase the freshness.

The bottom line was the gyro was very tasty and filling with a ton of meat for a great price. Both my girlfriend and I were so fully we ended up only needing a light dinner late. There are some other good gyro places that may be a bit more authentic to the middle eastern style but the King of Gyros is easily in contention for the Iron Throne of Gyros."}
{"text":"The Greek fries were amazing!! The green sauce served with the fries was delicious. The Greek salad is very good, served with the same green sauce."}
{"text":"Very good. Very satisfying. Greek fries are just normal fries with feta on them, nothing too extra about them. But still tasty! Good gyros. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Best Gyro salad! Food is amazing every single time! My favorite place hands down. Prices are great too."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and definitely hits the spot! I've tried the standard Gyro and the Chicken. The chicken had really good flavoring but a bit too dry and the Gyro was phenomenal. I like that they don't overdo it on the tzatziki sauce like a lot of places and the amount of meat they stack on the thing is great, especially for the price."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, best Gyro I have had anywhere. I visit King probably 2 to 3 times a week. High recommend the #5 Firefighter style."}
{"text":"Never a fan of Mediterranean cuisine, yet I'll try it often hoping I might change my opinion. 

Mah.. Ordered falafel pita - not a great taste but green sauce was awesome. Falafels were bland.
Personally not a fan of restaurants that expect tips before serving. King of gyros is one among them.

Decent ambience. Good for a one time visit."}
{"text":"Great Greek and Mediterranean food in a clean and modern setting. Dive quality food (and I mean that in the best possible way) in a nice upscale environment, but still reasonable prices.

Gyro salad was particularly good with tons of tasty Gyro meat, and the chicken Gyro was also excellent as well. I don't want to discount anything else because it was all great, but the best thing might have been the hot sauce, I put it on everything!

Owner was a nice friendly guy, took time to talk to us for awhile but wouldn't divulge his secret ingredient, other than they make everything from scratch there, other than the Gyro meat, which they buy from his hometown of Chicago."}
{"text":"Wow, my prayers have been answered! When I visit Arizona I usually reside in Tempe, and would have to go all the way to Phoenix to have the best gyros in town. Now that they opened ANOTHER King Gyros in Tempe, my trips to Arizona are gonna be a lot better. The food is truly one of a kind and hopefully they open many more!"}
{"text":"Always love coming to this place because the portions are huge, affordable, and I always leave very full and satisfied. The food has remained consistent in its delicious flavors every single time I've been back here and I never have any compliments even trying something new every time. The owner is super friendly and comes out to check on guests while they're eating which shows that they care and take pride in their business. I love this place and it has become one of my favorites. I highly recommend checking them out if you haven't already. (:"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bit, debating between this place and a sub place next door, boy am I glad we came here, their gyro sandwich was delicious, wrapped in fresh baked pita, and their service is great, very nice friendly workers there! Annnnnd to top it off they have Snapple!"}
{"text":"Had the shawarma plate with rice and, with a suggestion from the employee, the lentil soup. Everything was great! Good portions, good flavor, good prices, and I especially loved that soup!"}
{"text":"Great Schwarma, rice hummus. The hot sauce made in-house is wonderful. Authentic Greek food."}
{"text":"King of Gyros is Legit Greek Grub!!!

I have had several of their plates and sandwiches, all have been outstanding!  I especially like their Chicken dishes; however, if you like lamb, those dishes are delish as well.  Their Tzatzikiis' some of the best I have ever had, and I eat Greek / Mediterranean food a lot.   I live and work very close to this establishment and could eat it daily (yes, I have a problem).  Just like any other good restaurant, it gets quite busy around lunch time, and for food reason.  Great tasting, healthy Mediterranean food done right!

Check them out, you will enjoy it, I promise!"}
{"text":"Good gyros & gyro platters...the lentil soup was delicious but the kids' menu left a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"If you like good gyros then King Gyros will not disappoint! I tried the #1 and I asked for fries-which were made fresh to order! The food, staff, and chicago atmosphere all ties into a great lunch or dinner spot. Not to be confused with Gyros King, because this is the ONLY gyros spot in Arizona that I'll go to from now on :)"}
{"text":"One of a handful of places I've found in the east valley that serves Gyros like back in Chicagoland. Generous portion of meat carved from the rotisserie and served with onion, tomato and tzatziki sauce, not like some of the other joints out here that skimp on the meat and fill the pita up with lettuce. The Greek salad I had with the meal was very good as well. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service is terrific.  Food was delicious.  They definitely give you a healthy portion.   Great prices with lots of choices on menu."}
{"text":"I have NEVER come across better gyro than the one served at King Gyros. Im not sure if it's the tzatziki sauce, their gyro, or how it's cooked, but I need to know their secret! It is one of my favorite spots. Always delicious and always friendly service! They have a big selection of dishes, and it's hard to narrow it down to just one! Prices are reasonable especially for the generous size portion they give. Clean and nice place to dine in too. I love the Chicago theme they have!"}
{"text":"Very good! It is a family run business. The food was tasty and fresh. It was prepared super fast. And the owners are very friendly and pleasant. We went there two days in a row and will go again!"}
{"text":"best gyro in tempe area, huge gyro with a lot of crispy fries! and the huge chicago picture on the wall is spot on!"}
{"text":"I own a carpet cleaning business and I do a lot of work around the Tempe area. One thing that excites me about going to tempe is stopping by King Gyros. The food is very delicious. The service is wonderful. I highly recommend this place. You'll be very satisfied."}
{"text":"Won't lie, I have been coming to the King of Gyros for a while now and have debated on writing a review, mainly because I am selfish and didn't want to share this place with others haha. 

King Of Gyros is one of my favorite go to places for lunch, it's pretty quick and around the corner from my office.

I have tried the Chicken Shawarma pita combo, marinated grilled chicken breast, onions, tomatoes, lettuce and tzatziki sauce on a thick warm pita, also come with a side of fries! This pita is delish! 

I have also had the falafel, and those too are perfectly fired bites of heaven! Yummo! 

In the area, give King of Gyros a try, or maybe don't, that way its not too busy for me haha."}
{"text":"What a great Gyro Pita! Delicious meat, and lots of it! The King of Gyros is a regular lunchtime stop for me now."}
{"text":"I was in town in Tempe for business and somebody recommended I must try kings gyros. I'm glad I took their advice because I wound up here 2 days out of the 3 days I was visiting. 

When I spoke with the manager Arkid (nice guy, ask for what he recommends and he'll take care of you), I let him know this was truly some of the best food I tasted in my life.

The quality of the meat, sauces, seasonings, are truly top notch and you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. Wide variety of menu and the interior is nicely decorated with a Chicago style theme, even better since that's my home town!

Next time I'm in Arizona, the first stop I'm making is kings gyros!"}
{"text":"Got take out on a Saturday.
This place is really clean, and everyone was very nice.

Had the falafel platter, and friend had the gyro platter, which was apparently very good (and I noticed had a ton of meat).
I loved the falafel! At some restaurants, the falafel is so dry, but here they were moist and had really great flavor. SO nice to go somewhere where they are not treated like an afterthought!
The side salads that come with the platters were mediocre - they were really fresh but the dressing was boring. But everything else was delicious!
The platters are big enough for two meals; I had lunch the next day too.

Overall a great place, great value, excellent food! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It took me awhile to try this place. The strip mall storefront doesn't draw you in but what a great spot. It is frequently on my lunch rotation. The food is healthy and full of flavor, portions are large and reasonably priced, lots of choices and the service is fast. The staff is always pleasant. The only minus is everyone Hi has figured out how great this little place is. It would be nice if they had a line to pick up to go phone orders. Glad to see another successful small business."}
{"text":"Worst gyro I've ever had. I've never had a gyro made from Spam before, at least not until today. That's exactly what the gyro meat tasted like. It looked like typical gyro meat, but the taste was all Spam. And mushy. Gyro meat isn't supposed to be mushy.

The gyro sandwich is supposed to come with onion, tomato and tzatzíki sauce. I asked for no tomato and received: no tomato, no onion and a dab of tzatzíki. 

The side greek salad was okay, so long as you didn't want much more than lettuce. I did have a bite of a friend's chicken souvlaki and that tasted pretty good, but I won't be going there for their \"gyros\" sandwiches."}
{"text":"YUM! I was in Phoenix for a work conference and visited this place during our lunch hour. I had the chicken shawarma wrap and it was AMAZING. A very generous size, extremely flavorful, and amazing value. Located in a small shopping plaza with plenty of parking. This place is clean, the service is fast, and I really had no complaints! Highly recommend this small establishment."}
{"text":"I was honestly not impressed with this place. Came with the family and ordered several items across their menu including their signature Gyro. All the meats were dry and appeared overcooked. Given the prices, I was hoping for something that was deliciously flavored and cooked to perfection. Sadly both weren't present at our particular meal. Their fries that came along with the meal were also undercooked and not really flavorful. The Kefta plate which I had was the biggest offender as they were well overcooked and devoid of moisture...I was really depressed with that meal. The only saving grace was their pita was fresh and the highlight to that night.

I guess I will have to continue my search for a great Gyro place..."}
{"text":"Wow!  We went based on the Yelp reviews and were not disappointed! The food was served up quickly, the price was fair and we ate in delightful silence as we enjoyed our selections. Delicious!  I had the Gyro Salad with a little extra tzatziki and my plate was completely empty when I was done. The portions were sizable and it really was quite an excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Honestly the gyro meat is amazing! Had a gyro salad and they gave me so much food with it, could have made two meals out of it! To my surprise they even gave me a grilled pita on the side, would recommend for a nice lunch break in between work. Not sure if they are owned by Greeks or Arabs because they had items on the menu that are not all Greek. Regardless good variety and awesome price!"}
{"text":"I was in the Area for work stopped in for dinner to go as usual the gyros and fries were excellent also picked up a beef sandwich for the wife. She said beef was very good I have not tried anything else on menu this is gyro go to place great food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"As a Chicago native who still gets homesick every year during The Taste (of Chicago) in great part due to the fact that I hadn't found anyplace in the Valley even close to the gyros found in Chicago, I'm beyond thrilled with my recent discovery of King Gyros! I don't know what they do to their meat but it's got the most incredible flavor, and the food is always fresh and delicious. The beautiful mural of the Windy City and friendly, helpful staff are tzatzki sauce on the lamb! When they say as close to Chicago as it gets, they're not kidding!"}
{"text":"Best gyro shop I've been to out of the dozens I've visited over the years. They have the best quality and quantity here. I get my gyro salad firefighter style with hot giardiniera. I recommend ordering before you go during lunch hour, it's a bit of a wait usually. That's my only complaint"}
{"text":"This is by far the best gyro place, but don't be fooled into thinking that's all they have. The kefta is amazing and so is the chicken slouvaki!!! The rice is always perfectly cooked and delicious. Also, they now serve lentil soup. You wouldn't think lentil soup would be something to be excited about until you've had it here! So flavorful. The prices are more than fair considering you get a ton of food for what you pay. Everything is super clean and never dirty or messy. All of the employees are always helpful and gracious. The owner and his family are truly amazing and are willing to accommodate your order.  I love this place as does my entire family. We usually go at least twice a week; sometimes more. I highly recommend it! I only gave it 5 stars because that's the most it will allow or I'd give it a 10."}
{"text":"So I just had the best experience from an amazing restaurant. Great customer service too because I wasn't sure how the lamb would taste and the awesome cooks gave me a little box to try. I really believe this is the best chicken souvlaki I have ever had and I will come back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"I was treated to lunch here and was excited by the reviews since I had never been to this place. Fast friendly service and amazing food was what I got!!!. Ordered the gyro combo and was suprised how large the portions were...we were not disappointed and did not leave hungry. We definately will go back again!"}
{"text":"I didn't even eat here because the cashier wasted my time talking to the customer in front of me who already received her order. There were four customers behind me and he even continued to keep talking after making eye contact with me."}
{"text":"Really reasonable prices, generous portions, and the best chicken gyro I have had in Arizona. I will definitely keep coming back and tell all my friends to check it out."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Mediterranean/Greek food. The staff working were very welcoming and went out of their way to make my first visit a great one. The food was incredible. Everything was seasoned perfectly and cooked on point. I would have eaten an entire second plate if I could. I will definitely be going back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Awesome! So well seasoned-- made to order fresh & hot! The best falafel I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I got the combination platter here after I couldn't decide between the chicken shawarma and the gyro. Unfortunately the chicken shawarma looked a lot tastier than it actually was as it was fairly tough. I would recommend not asking for a salad as your side dish since all of the plates come with a salad already. The gyro meat itself was pretty good and they definitely give you a large portion of food here for how much it costs! 

This is an above average Mediterranean place but still falls short to the likes of hajji baba in Tempe! I definitely wouldn't mind coming here again though."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Ordered the lunch Gyro, salad and beverage. Reasonably priced, quick service, and good food."}
{"text":"Oh My word...I saw this place and another and so, I had to try them both this evening.  Gluttonous...??  Why yes...it was.  Was it worth it?  Absolutely!  This was hands down the best Gyro I've had outside of Detroit...and trust me, I've \"tried\" a S**T-Ton in every state north and west of New Mexico.  It's funny the simplicity of a Gyro...you think you've found a good one until you FINALLY find a really-really F-ing good one!  Picture to come...crazy huge but more importantly, crazy-crazy delicious!!!!  

Enjoy Chandler - you bastards!  :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the combo plate with chicken schawarma and gyro. Chicken was ok and gyro meat was good. What really thru me off was when I ask for spicy sauce or the chilli paste your normally get with gyro places all they had was buffalo sauce and siracha which didn't go well with this kind of food."}
{"text":"Ok this is a good gyro. Always ask for greek fries. This felt like gyros from home,  Chicago. Open kitchen was nice. Food was very fresh tasting"}
{"text":"Came upon this place while browsing through yelp. Impressed with the 4 1/2 star reviews I hurried here before picking up my son from school. I ordered 2 gyros for take out. I'd have to say though... their service is pretty quick and efficient. But their gyro meats were a bit tough. Flavorful but tough. Also for what they charge, you get a gyro big enough for sharing. 

I'll try them again next time for dine in to see if I'll have a different opinion. Some places are just not good for take out, maybe they are one of those places."}
{"text":"!!! YAS YAS YAS!! For much less than I normally spend on lonely take-out hotel meals I ate like queen. I got a plate with gyro and falafel, fries, salad- all of which includes a drink for like $10.  I added on dolmas for good measure. The staff worked away in the open kitchen, still looking jovial and busy even 15 mins before close. There were so many little things that impressed me like, y'all- they have really good iced tea options! And little plastic containers so you can help yourself to accoutrements, cause you should fetch your own ketchup like an adult. 

Anyways, totes bomb! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Souvlaki was great! And they give you a ton!!! Definitely coming back! So glad I work close to this location!"}
{"text":"My expectations were high and they definitely delivered! I got The sampler platter which comes with three meats,  salad and1 side.  I got steak, shawarma, and chicken souvlaki with hummus. The pizza rolls it came with were a nice accompaniment along with the tziki sauce"}
{"text":"Fast service, good gyro! Stopped in for a quick lunch in a break from a workshop. Got 10% for checking in so that's awesome"}
{"text":"This Greek fast casual restaurant is right down the street from my gym so we stop here once in a while when we need a quick dinner after working out. The food is pretty decent. A lot of the meats seem to be cooked ahead of time and then reheated but I guess that is what you have to do in order to get it out fast. Their pita bread is always soft and warm and tastes like it was fresh baked in house. Unfortunately I am in the middle of a gluten free experiment so I can't partake in any of that right now. But I am happy that almost any meat on the menu can be ordered in salad form. I am pretty picky about salad dressings but I love the house Greek dressing. So lemony! Yum! The salad base is romaine lettuce but they also include a bunch of other fresh veggies like bell pepper, onion, tomato, cucumber as well as feta and kalamata olives.

Most of the people working there are college age kids but they all are really courteous. We have always gotten great service. Last night we were there right as they were closing (8pm) but they still went out of their way to make sure we got everything we needed for our take out order. They also have sort of a Chicago theme going on so we got to catch part of the Bears preseason game while we waited."}
{"text":"Enjoy King sized portions of meat for prices reasonable enough for a serf. There are quite a few meats and a few vegetarian options for both plates and pita sandwiches, with a combo option that includes a drink and soda or salad. I went with the #7 chicken shawarma pita combo with fries. It came out in a few minutes, filled to the brim with marinated chicken breast, onion, mixed greens, tomato, and a hearty layer of tzatziki sauce. The chicken was tender and the vegetables fresh with a soft, warm, fluffy textured pita. It was so big it wouldn't really fit in the \"Gyro\" paper sandwich holder that came with it.

The fries were crinkle cut and were cooked well. There is a soda fountain with Pepsi products, Dr. Pepper, diet Dr. Pepper, and various iced teas to the side. 

The interior is spacious with high ceilings and a dark grey/black theme. The tables are nice with granite countertops.

The total for the pita combo was a little less than $10.

Service at the counter was decent, not super friendly but hey what do you expect from a fast food place.

I'll be back for more delicious pitas and plates!"}
{"text":"It was good. I ordered the steak shawarma and hummus. The steak was good with strong flavors of turmeric.  The hummus and tziziki sauce were on point!"}
{"text":"Currently eating as I swipe this on my phone and I understand the 5 star rating. The place is very clean, and inviting. It has a hip, city feel to it unlike other gyro places that are in need of an update. I feel like I'm back in Cali or Seattle. Prices are pretty on point so not much to say there. The staff is very friendly and easy going. 
So the food... The gyro is really wonderful!! The tzatziki sauce is fantastic. Layered under the shaved meat is onions and sliced tomato. Really delicious. However, my only criticism are the fries. They're very much an after thought. No seasoning, thick starchy pieces of potato. So 4 stars. Next time I'll just have the sandwich alone or try one of their salads. Other than the fries this was an excellent experience. I'd definitely be back. Oooh and they have styrofoam cups! Back to 5 stars! I'm aware they suck for the environment but name another material that keeps your drink cold for literally hours in our Arizona heat. ...Yeah exactly."}
{"text":"I don't know why the plates are more expensive if they have just as much/ if not less their regular pita with the exception of sides. Ordered the supreme plate and the steak and chicken were as burnt and dry as the desert... king of what again??????"}
{"text":"Delicious food & generous servings. Stopped in for lunch today at 12:30. The cashier greeted us and helped pick the perfect plate for our lunch cravings. We waited bout 10 minutes- not bad for a weekday lunch rush! We had the Greek Gyro and Chicken Gyro plates. One with regular fries and the other with Greek fries."}
{"text":"This place is amazing,  I love the staff,  the chef always cooks my meat to perfection,  their salads are great also.  I love getting the beef souvlaki pita with side Greek salad. The cashier is always helpful and full of suggestions. Their food turnaround is pretty good and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"This place is THE TITS for delicious gyros!!! It's my go-to for quick, super delicious, filling, delectable vittles that satiate all the senses  Not to mention that they have a fairly decent (if small) beer selection that includes a few crafts that help to wash it all down  Love it- make it a point to go every few weeks or so"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place for lunch, which is a shame because it is right across the parking lot from my job. I wish I had tried it sooner, I was very happy with it.  I had the kefta plate with rice and lentil soup.  Kefta was good, and the rice was pretty standard. Lentil soup was the star - very tasty, I highly recommend it.  Also had some pita and hummus to share and I enjoyed both. The hummus had a great texture and a noticeable tahini flavor, which is how I prefer it.  They do not skimp on the portion sizes, I left very full."}
{"text":"This place is another... if not my go to place to order pick up.  Their food is absolutely amazing! The meats are seasoned to perfection....prices are reasonable and my favorite....a good ol mom and pop shop. The food exudes the owners love for their specialty. If your looking for some good mediterranean food....this is your place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!   Real Greeks cooking real Greek food.   I mean they even asked how I want my meat cooked...  Never experienced that at a gyro joint.   Will be going back..  Many more times."}
{"text":"We love this place, it's so convenient and quick. The gyro salad is my absolute go-to and they never fail me. I've only done take out but the restaurant itself is much larger than you'd expect, clean, newer furniture/decor and perfect for a quick sit down meal. While I don't frequent King of Gyros on a weekly basis, every time I go it seems as if everyone else goes on a daily basis! One time I was in, the lady at the register (I'm assuming maybe owner?) acknowledged the three people that came after either by name or by their repeat order. I was super impressed. There's also an older gentleman that works there, who is always so kind and welcoming every time I come in. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Finally found a place with gyros like from Chicago. Why? Because they're from Chicago!
Excellent gyros, soups, whatever you get here, you'll like. Nonstop crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"The place is very clean and nice inside but the french fries weren't done enough they were very mushy. For my taste I could have used a bit more tzatziki sauce. Overall experience wasn't bad but wasn't great so I'll give them a 3."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly, and the food is terrific.  I usually order the gyro combo meal or the Chicken Shawerma, and they are both great.  Great portion sizes, and I'd pay for the hummus by itself.  Nice staff as well.  Traditional lunchtime hours are super busy, though.  There are at least 2 other Mediterranean-style restaurants nearby but this one definitely has the best food (and best hot sauce, ijs)."}
{"text":"I first started coming here when I worked at the big Company that shares the parking lot. Many co-workers would rave about this place so of course I had to give it a shot (and they offer a 10% discount if you have a badge from that Company).

The Gyros, Shawarma and Chicago Dog are awesome. As are the greek fries and regular french fries. The crinkle fries are always hot, fresh and crispy. I can never resist the boxes of pistachio baklava sitting next to the cash register either. 

This is a very affordable establishment to grab a quick bite. And fairly healthy! I love these family owned places."}
{"text":"Honestly unsure how they've got such a high rating on yelp. Gyro meat is of the prepackaged strip variety and not freshly shaved."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Their food reminds me of airport food. Not made fresh and overpriced. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Super tasty food, and really great people working there--they're always really kind and quick. Last time I went in I was on my lunch break and was wearing my company ID, the gentleman behind the counter let me know that what I had ordered (something that is not my regular order) is actually the something  that takes the longest to cook, so if I was in a hurry he wanted to be sure I had a heads up on that.. (It was less than 10 mins). Very thoughtful gesture. If you are looking for excellent food provided by friendly faces, look no further."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma it was probably the best shawarma I have had in a pita sandwich my mouth is still watering, want to try the beef shawarma next time"}
{"text":"So good, so quick, generous portion sizes, fairly priced, and they move you quickly even during busy lunchtime."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat elsewhere, but they were closed from 2:30-5 (Indian food), so went here just based off the reviews, got two wraps and they were both amazing. The Souvlaki was just spectacular, and the Shwarma plate had no complaints. 

Will stop by and get a plate next time."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here! Where do I start?
-Staff-they were genuine. The gentleman that helped us spent the time to explain the menu. Super friendly people. 
-Food-the food was delicious. My daughter and I shared the chicken souvlaki and it was plenty of food.  
-Cleanliness-this place was spotless! The restroom was immaculate. This is a real plus for me. 
-Beer-$1.99-$2.99. IPAs for $2.99. A great deal-husband was happy. Only wish they had wine!
Our 7 year old decided that we need to eat here every Saturday because she liked it so much. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! First time trying it I had the firecracker chicken gyro and it was probably the best place in Phoenix. I believe the owner was there and was very friendly. The rest of the staff was great. You all really need to try this place if you're craving a gyro. Yum! :) so very satisfied"}
{"text":"Tried it twice. Had potential the first time over a year ago but after this second time I'll never be back.

Pita: hard and tasteless

Gyro meat: meh

Chicken Schwarma: dry as hell

Hummus: tasteless!

Everything was fairly dry. We asked for more sauces and they basically wanted another dollar for more sauce.

If people need sauce for your food to make it edible, give it to them. Especially when they just paid you $26 for a Gyro and a Combo plate.


Screw this place. Lots better all around it.

If you want bomb middle eastern food try Haji Baba up in N Tempe or even Persian Room"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Not only is the food tasty and fresh but for the price, you get a lot of food. The staff is very friendly and go above and beyond. I've had the chicken shawarma with both the hummus and the tabouli. I dare say it's better than Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Gyro joint south of the H-60. however when they get slammed, service is slow about 15-20min for some orders. The quality of the food is only affected by a short on meat portions, other than that it's still very tasty."}
{"text":"Ok customer service, food was good and they had great choices/selections of meals.
I got a meal plate and it was very tasty. The gyro meal was good too. Prices are well reasoned for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"We decided to try King of Gyros while we were down that way. I found it just great. My wife and I commented it was like a restaurant we went to in the past and no longer exist. Any time I an in that area they can count on my business. It is simple clean and the tables were not crowded. And most of all the food was good."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic; not only is their food great, but you really can't beat the price for meat of this quality especially considering the quantity you get."}
{"text":"I LOVE the gyros salad!! Big and yummy!! If you like spicy,  ask for it fire fighter style!!!
I always get my food To-Go but the restaurant is clean and has sports on TV and beer bargains!!!
You can ask for chicken swarma meat, I added it to roasted vegetables, and then ate the other half the next day with eggs! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best gyro and Greek salad I've ever had. Everything here looks great. Especially the crinkle cut Fries"}
{"text":"This spot was filled with hungry customers chowing down on a variety of pita sammies.  I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki combo with fries.  The chicken breast was very tasty-grilled to perfection and not dry.  I just wish there was more of it-rather lean on the chicken portions.  I am used to the bountiful Chicken sammie @ Greek Wraps-just spoiled I guess.  The fries were plentiful-just needed to be crispier.  They add a yummy sauce for your meal-a nice touch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place!! The food is delicious , the place is casual and clean , staff is very nice ! We love the chicken schawarma plate, but everything I've had is good!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chicago style gyro. Has a Pepsi machine, not Coke, so I'm sad. The gyro was good with lots of meat and the fries are yummy though plain (no seasoning at all)."}
{"text":"Great food recommend to any one who loves good food, chicken is alright but everything is delicious. Crowded at lunch so get there early.. fast service"}
{"text":"Day after Xmas around 3:30. Ordered chicken shawarma pita and it was dry, dry, dry, dry, dry!  Man, it was physically difficult to eat....like  you really gotta work at it. The pita was stale and dare I say maybe over microwaved. The chicken was like...I dunno...it was just dry. Couldn't really tell you about the flavor.  It's hard to tell when you're working so hard just to chew. I'm guessing this was a one off occurrence for being closed for Xmas since the rest of the reviews are good and there were quite a few patrons at this weird time. So...take this with a grain of salt...and maybe some extra sauce."}
{"text":"I live nearby and I feel very lucky to have this place so close to home! Best gyros in town!! Give them a try, you will love it!"}
{"text":"First time here and the gyro was amazing! I will come back again if I am in the area. Quick service, hot food made fresh, and they were very polite. A bonus was that they are obviously from Chicago, my hometown!"}
{"text":"Are 10 stars available?!  
I eat there ~3 times a week. From the gyro sandwich to the chicken gyro plate to the chicken gyro salad, you.cant.go.wrong.
Call ahead if you can, lunch is busy!"}
{"text":"For a Greek casual fast food place... this place is amazing.  The service and staff here is great, the gyros here are SUPERB! They pack their gyros full of meat and the price is pretty cheap.  They have amazing variety of selections as well.  There is a reason why everyone rated this place as 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came across this place by accident. Walked in, Checked out the menu and ordered the #14.  Chicken plate with rice and bowl of lentil soup. I was not expecting this much food. The lentil soup was delicious. The rice was nice and fluffy and the chicken was great. This place blew me away for a fast food looking place. Bring ur appetite"}
{"text":"Have to go along with most of the other reviews, hands down best gyro ever!! The meat was so flavorful & tender, amazing sauce and a great pita. Also staff is very friendly. Loved the Chicago memorabilia reminds me of home. Go there hungry!!"}
{"text":"Talk about AMAZING Greek food. The chicken gyro was amazing, the hummus is to die for, and the salad as a side was delicious. Proportions are extremely fair sized and the price isn't bad at all for the amount of food. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good gyro.  There was enough meat that I either had to eat it with a fork or wear it.  Side salad was good with a nice mix of veg.  For the amount of food, price was more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Want to try some authentic Mediterranean  food this is the place to be. Very friendly staff and amazing food. Restaurant is family owned so they make sure you are happy with your food. It tried the number 8 chicken wrap it is so good! You also need to try the hummus it taste amazing!!!"}
{"text":"It was jam packed at noon. Lots of business pants in here! People clearly like this place. I ordered a gyro combo. The salad was exceptional and gyro was delicious. Best tzatziki I've ever had. Dill!!! Seating was limited and it took about ten or twelve min to get food during the rush. Five stars after a return visit for consistency points."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD EVER! A1 service and food. Can't beat the price and always delivers. I would recommend for sure to others. Also the counter girl is pretty cute. :-)"}
