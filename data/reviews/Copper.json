{"text":"I gave it two stars because they try too hard and the flavors are forced.  By that I mean, I dont think the flavors are genuine.    This was my first time to Copper.  Upon entering you are greeted by a very warm and friendly staff.  The decor is a not at all \"modern\" as some have described (I guess those people think modern is anything that's not painted beige).  I do agree seating is tight especially if you get a table in the corner by the windows.  The music is contemporary indian.    The food was just ok.  I visited during restaurant week and there was a limited menu.  However, you are fee to order off the regular menu as well.  I ordered the cucumber avocado soup, the chicken, and the mango kulfi for dessert.  The avocado soup was not good.  I found it to be bland and the texture off.  The chicken was dry and needed more sauce to get by.  The mango kulfi was ridiculous and had deep flavor.    If you are looking for a serious Indian restaurant - this is not the place for you.  If you are interested in trying something a little different and an enjoyable atmosphere go try Copper."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food. I wish this restaurant was here in Atlanta. Copper takes Indian cuisine to the next level. Presentation is outstanding and you can taste each unique flavor. That's pretty rare for Indian food which usually has a lot of intense flavors that are hard to decipher. We shared samosas as appetizers and I ordered the rack of lamb medium rare. It was divine. When I am visiting Charlotte next I will make it out to Copper once again!"}
{"text":"One of the best in charlotte, NC....very tasty..Chicken Tikka Massala is lovely. enjoy the ambiance and friendly service"}
{"text":"Great place! Went here with my boss and co-worker for a relaxing evening. Was impressed with the knowledgable staff. They were great to offer recommendations. Atmosphere was charming and relaxing. Food was so good. Spices and flavors melted in my mouth. Will go back and take clients or just for fun."}
{"text":"Amazing! Our main entr√©es were absolutely delicious! I had sea bass in a curry sauce and my guy had chicken in creme tomato sauce. The only reason I am not giving this restaurant 5 stars was because we did not like our appetizer very much (scallops)but that maybe just due to our own tastes. The wait staff were all great as well. We can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Plating is elegant. Service is bad. Asked the waiter which lamb dish would he recommend, he  was not interested to elaborate.  I found a strand of hair on my veggie, told the waiter and he just smile and didn't say much. I'm very disappointed on how he reacted, seemed like he didn't care about the hygiene."}
{"text":"Upscale and delicious. We've been to several Indian restaurants in larger cities and this one is the best we've had."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some good Indian food, this is not the place to be. They cook like sh!t and the servings are not the worth they claim it. Bottom line u don't want to be here for REal Indian food.... Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Luscious!! Yes that's a word I would use for the food here. Indian food with a slight twist. The chef has tried creative tricks to add interest to a traditional menu without taking it too far from the origins. Love the saag paneer - it's tricky to make this in the right balance without letting the cream overwhelm the dish. The chicken tikka masala is just yum. But you get extra brownie points or I should say gulab jamun points for making the simple old salad with cheese just a wonderful surprise on days you don't want something heavy. Must visit."}
{"text":"Yummy - everything outstanding and delicious! Especially liked cauliflower appetizer and three layered ice cream."}
{"text":"Good Indian food in great setting. Loved their Saag Paneer and Channa."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian restaurant in Charlotte. We visited friends for a few days and they recommended this place. We were running late and the kitchen was about to close but they waited for us and we had a great meal and service. Highly recommend Panner Makhni for dinner and Kulfi for dessert. It was delicious! We will definitely come back to Copper restaurant next time we visit."}
{"text":"Came for dinner. Relatively small menu and not a lot of the things you expect to find at an Indian restaurant but everything I had was delicious. Next time I'm in Charlotte I will definitely come back.   If you didn't notice the sign in the front yard, you might think this was just a house on a residential street, which is what it used to be. There is a small parking lot to the side.   Servers were all friendly and prompt. The \"Murgh Chicken Tikka Masala\" is delicious, but it's definitely enough for two, especially if you are getting anything else. I had the soup of the day, which was a delicious creamy roasted red pepper puree. (Not spicy at all - like roasted red bell peppers.) I also got the garlic naan, which was light and fluffy with garlic and oil rubbed on it - very tasty. The kulfi desert was a very small pyramid of three different flavored ice creams surrounded by 4 little pieces of dried figs and a \"smear\" of blueberry on the dish. Very pretty, but probably not big enough for two unless you just want to share a few bites of something sweet."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this restaurant because its just that good. The restaurant looks like an old house, with several different rooms. The lamb meatballs were simply fantastic and samosa was pretty good too. The remaining entrees were very good but not phenomenal. Menu was pretty pricey, but overall I would say worth it. The apple chaat martini was a great cocktail to begin the night. Service was excellent; our waiter was attentive and prompt."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have ever had.  I have eaten in Indian restaurants across the US, and this is by far the best!  Depth of flavor is amazing.  Samosas are outstanding."}
{"text":"Over priced, low grade food with poor service. I am from out of town and was craving Indian food. This place had great reviews. Waited for 5mins at the front before I was greeted. Sat at bar. Nice bar tender. The food was soul less. If you want authentic yet intelligent modern cuisine do not go to this place. It's NYC prices without the taste or quality. Very dissapointing. Dont waste your money/time."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner during Restaurant Week, since we've had great luck with tasting menus in the past.  We also planned for an early dinner, since it was  previously reviewed as a very dark restaurant.  We made reservations at 6PM through opentable.com, but when we got there, they didn't have us down on the list (we only made them about an hour or so beforehand, so this was excusable).  We were still able to be seated, primarily because it was early and the restaurant wasn't crowded.  The hostess and our waitress were very nice.  She took our drink order pretty quickly once we were seated.  The drink menu was a little disappointing. Everything sounded very...gross isn't the right word...unfruity.  Lots of peppar, various spices, mint.  Not many fruity delicious yummy cocktails like I wanted. I got one called the Neelkantha, and it was alright--hypnotiq, curacao, and chambord--but I probably would get some wine next time, or just drink beforehand.  Their wine list is extensive.  As I said, we tried the tasting menu, and the dishes were all good.  We both loved our appetizers.  I had the Coriander Coconut Shrimp.  There were two huge shrimp with a mustard-black  pepper glaze, masala acorn squash (a small slice), and a ginger beet puree that was beautifully beet colored and tasted very earthy like beets.  I loved this dish, and felt like a Top Chef judge with the plating and the cerebral list of ingredients.  My husband had the sheekh kabab meatballs with karavali masala, eggplant-poblano chutney, crispy leeks and a mango avocado salad (read: piece each of avocado, mango, and grapefruit).  This was very spicy, but I could still taste the underlying flavors of the dish as well.  Again, presentation was lovely.   The main course was challenging for my husband, so we had to trade plates.  Originally I had ordered the masala duck leg confit with kundapur spices, seasonal veggies, and pomegranate syrah jus.  But my husband didn't like his very much (he's a meat and potatoes sort of guy), so I gave it up after a bite so he could eat something he would enjoy.  (The guy just had back surgery, I thought I would give him a break.)  So I ended up eating khoya prune kofta with a milk solids dumpling, prune-ginger chili puree, seviyan ka upma, mirchi ka salan sauce. (One was green, the other white.  I didn't know the difference!)  This was good, but unlike anything I had ever eaten before. The \"dumpling\" was a 4 x 1 brick on the plate that, by itself, tasted like milk! But the prune fried balls were pretty sweet and yummy, and the sauces complimented them well.  For dessert, we both had the mango gajrela puff.  They took our knives from dinner, and I would have liked to have it, as sawing through the pastry (which was a little wet) with the side of my fork was a bit tough.  The rabdi ice cream that came with it was quite good, though I am somewhat of an Indian food neophyte, so I don't know what exactly that flavor is.    Even with the tasting menu, we still paid over $100 for dinner, which seemed a bit high. We each had 2 cocktails, so I guess that adds up quickly, but I didn't feel like we had a $100 experience overall.    Lessons learned:  1.  Come early so you can see the menu 2. Drink cocktails before and after dinner 3.  Be prepared to spend some cash, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Someone brought me takeout from Copper, so I'll save the 5th star until after I visit in person. This review is based solely on the deliciously garlicky naan and the perfect Murgh Tikka Masala...that sh*# was off the hook. Go get some."}
{"text":"I now have hope for the future of Indian food in the USA, why? Because I tasted it tonight.  Copper offers a smaller menu than most, but what there is, is exceptional in taste and presentation.  Samosas are traditional in flavor, but unique in presentation, and in a delicious sweet and savory sauce.  The Goan prawn curry was the exact heat one would expect from a Goan dish, and a elk balanced use of spices gave a great flavor.  I always reserve judgement on a curry house until I try the kulfi, in Copper 's case it is very different, presented with quartered figs, and a couple of fruit paints. Although I missed the cardamom and pistachio reduction, this was a good alternative.  The service is very attentive, if you sit in the front the floor leans quite considerably and I found myself putting my foot out to steady myself, but the building is old and definately has charm from the outside, while housing a contemporary interior."}
{"text":"Yum! Flavorful!  Everything we had was so delicious.  The ambience is great, the food is really flavorful.  Loved it all!"}
{"text":"First time here after hearing such great raves from friends. The food was excellent and very flavorful! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give Copper 3 stars because it would be unfair to them to give less. Honestly, though, they're just a solid 2 1/2 stars, middle-of-the-road, restaurant, in my opinion.    For years, I've heard people singing the praises of Copper's food, but I could never convince myself that I really wanted to stop in for a bite.  Last night, the allure of 1000 bonus points on opentable.com and the excitement of being 1000 points closer to our $100 gift certificate spurring us on, Ginny and I decided to give Copper a try.    For starters, I don't want a modern take on ethnic food.  I simply want to eat authentic (or as close to authentic as I can get without eating the excretory parts of an animal) ethnic food.  If I lived in India perhaps a modern take on Indian food would excite my palate.  I do not live in India, though.  I live in Charlotte.  Unfortunately, ethnic restaurants in smaller cities have to cater to American taste buds in order to stay in business, and I believe Copper has subscribed to that philosophy.  Nouveau Charlotteans do love anything described as \"modern,\" \"upscale,\" or \"urban,\" so Copper could serve Aunt Jemima pancakes smothered in masala and lure a crowd of identically dressed urban dwellers into their restaurant with the mere description of \"an upscale and modern twist on a traditional pancake.  3 pancakes:  $25.99.\"    Sorry for the tangent....  On to the review.  The naan was good.  The meat was overcooked.  The spices--the best part of Indian cooking--were not terribly bold.  Unfortunate.  The servers were attentive, professional and quick to offer a suggestion when asked about their favorite dish.  The food was overpriced for the quality.  The restaurant space is quite nice, and with quite a few overhauls to the menu I think that Copper could be nearly as fantastic as all the fantastic reviews.  Until then, I'll be staying away."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food, Fantastic Service!  If you like deserts their molten chocolate cake is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I have been to Copper twice.  The food is excellent.  Sometimes you just want Indian food in a nicer setting - this is the place.  I'm not an Indian food expert, but I love it and am continually disappointed with the availability of it in Charlotte.  However, I am totally unimpressed with the service at Copper.  Both times I've found the service to be extremely slow.  During my recent experience, the server didn't even check back after we got our food.  Normally this wouldn't have bothered me, but I really needed a small spoon for my kid, and eventually tracked down a hostess to get one.  She forgot, and by the time we were able to get our waiter's attention, we were done eating.  I probably will not go back any time soon, as I can't justfy spending that kind of money for service that's lacking.  The fact that this place is slammed even during the week at 6pm despite the poor service just speaks to the dearth of other Indian options in this town."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants serving Indian food that I have been to in the recent times. The food was flavorful with just the right amount of spices and you can feel the aroma as you walk in.  The ambiance was good and I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"So, I'm pregnant and the cravings are in full force. I got it in my head the other day that I needed to have some Indian food, so I jumped on yelp to find something close to us to try. Copper looked good so my husband picked some up for us on his lunch break. We both got an order of the lunch special of chicken tikka masala. This was exactly what I was hoping for! Fantastic, creamy, rich flavor for the sauce, tender, white meat chicken, and soft, fluffy naan. So good! The only reason I didn't go 5 stars was because the salad was just ok. It was pretty much just lettuce and carrots and the dressing wasn't anything to write home about. Overall though, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there and were excited to try another Indian place. We eat Indian food once a week and love it! It's a renovated house like a few places on East Blvd. Looked great very much a nice place to bring your date. To start they brought us out a single piece of Naan with 3 dipping sauces. Which was pretty good. For an appetizer we did the Amritsari Garlic Chicken. It was a nice presentation but very lite on the seasoning and a very small portion. lucky if it were 3 oz. For an App this small and bland it just isn't worth it to order at all. For dinner My wife ordered her fav dish (Chicken Chittinadu) and she requested spicy, real spicy and I ordered mine the Murgh Tikka Masala. Once again the presentation was fancy but the meal was very light on spices. My dish was really more like a thick tomato soup with chicken than a spicy Tikka Masala like I am used to and Hers was barely negligible on the spicy level. Lastly and the biggest thing I didn't like was adding in 30% gratuity automatically on a $37 bill the tip was auto billed in at $11. This was for a party of TWO people. Overall it is a nice Indian Restaurant if you have never had Indian Food before and want someplace nice to take a date. Save some cash and a go to Passage To India (University Area). Great food, huge menu (Vegan and Regular). Out of the five places we have gone to in Charlotte they are still the best.  If you've never tried Indian...you will prolly like it."}
{"text":"Great upscale atmosphere, the food is deliciously different than your regular Indian fare, generous portions and very flavorful curries."}
{"text":"Dinners at Copper have always been great. The cuisine is modern but still incorporates traditional and authentic flavors. The food is expensive, but still reasonable considering the quality. Great presentation and cozy ambiance. The service can be slow."}
{"text":"Copper was very good. The dishes were high quality, and flavorful. The food was not as well executed as some of our favorite nicer Indian restaurants up north, but Copper was without question the best we've found in Charlotte. We ate off the traditional portion of the menu and will probably try some of their \"modern\" options next time.   The dining room was very cool - kind of a slick modern renovation of a traditional house. The staff was attentive and professional. We were also very surprised by our reasonable bill at the end of the meal. We really liked Copper and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Before I get into the review, I want to say that I really really really wanted to like this place. My husband had been discouraging in trying the place out and I insisted that with so many raving reviews on Yelp, the restaurant surely had to be doing something right.   SO we went on a Saturday night after making online reservations for 3. We were seated at the window overlooking East Blvd, with a street lamp glaring in our face from across the street (Perhaps some sheers will help this?)   We placed our drink orders and then a secondary waiter gave the complimentary hot and fluffy naan w/ chutney tray. We then ordered a salad and the samosa potli (pouch). The salad was average and plentiful, however the samosa was tasty yet very small portioned. Both were $7.  Next we ordered our entrees: 2 'modern' vegetarian dishes and 1 non-veg. The goat cheese malai kofta was not flavored or seasoned. The only taste was of the goat cheese. The other veg dish was a tomato-potato dish. This was also the same way. According to the Yelp reviews, the chicken tikka was a must-order. I couldn't differ more on that opinion. The dish was wayy too creamy and not flavored at all. Add to the fact that you can only make the tikka more spicy and not the veg dishes because it's already prepped?! What Indian restaurant has that policy?  Needless to say, the only things above average were the naan and the secondary waiter's service. Below average was the tasteless food. Copper, please don't insult the Indian diner by serving this food that you call \"authentic and modern.\" And this is before I even got to the price point of the food. Simply highway robbery when you charge customers that much for flavorless entrees.  I would not recommend this place to even a person trying Indian food time for the first time."}
{"text":"My review has nothing to do with the food. In fact I'm in theUber on the way home from picking up from copper. I had a very awkward experience with the lady who was expediting and organizing delivery orders. She stared me down pretty much the entire time... never really experienced this kind of rudeness. Perhaps it is because I asked for utensils... who knows. Either way this person is unfit for a customer facing job. Unfortunate experience at a restaurant I have heard many things about. Hopefully the food is good!"}
{"text":"Very good but definitely \"modern\". The food is not spicy at all and even the hot sauce they brought out to me wasn't that spicy. However, I still like it. The ambiance is great and the staff is nice and the food is good."}
{"text":"If you want overpriced food on over sized dishes then look no further!  I would love to say the atmosphere was amazing or service was stellar, but it was lacking on all counts. From the parking lot to the interior of the house..oops I mean restaurant. The food wasn't terrible, but not even close to most of the other Indian cuisine destinations in the Charlotte area. Like most places in that area (Dilworth), it's just over hyped by people who have never had the food properly served or prepared before."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food of it's kind  I've ever had.  It will certainly be added to my list of favorites and regulars in CLT.  We started with the Saffron, Almond & Paneer Kulcha bread with Yogurt dip.  I had Chicken with Coconut cream sauce and my husband had a spicy Seafood dish.  Wines by the glass touches on the standard/common varietals.  Unfortunately some of the selections are a little common as well.  We both had left overs to bring home.  I recommend reservations.  They have outdoor seating.  One side of the indoor seating has good light to see out the porch and the other is a little more intimate.  I also saw people coming in for take away."}
{"text":"Sad in Charlotte... Copper restaurant Chlt nc. ..So I go to the hospital to give blood, can't get out till 2. I look on google maps.. Indian cuisine..yum open till 2:30.  I haven't had any Indian food for a year...seriously don't live near any restaurants.  Really looking forward to this. Would be hard to disappoint me right.....I get there 2:45. Yes made it. Walk in door.  We are closed. I said its 2:25. Yes but we are closed. I said google n ur sign say 2:30. No our chef leaves at 2:15. So I say.. Really the owner put 2:30 on google and the door n ur chef walks out at 2:15.  He says well I can give you something to go. Ok... What choice do I hv... Do u have buriani?  No. Really?  Yep. Ok what do u hv... Lunch specials. Ok tikka masala - I've never had it, but this is a 4 star Rstrnt I'm sure I'll like. Ok I'll have lamb.  Ok. So I stand n wait at the front door till the bar tender has mercy on me n seats me at the bar... Not a table... Mind u there are 3 tables still eating in the restaurant.  Drink? I'll hv water to go evidently.  Ok bartender says.  Here comes matre de again .. No lamb. Really? Is this place Indian?  Ok I'll hv chicken.  Here come the bag. U need a plate... Yes n napkins etc. Ok. All in bag I pay n leave. Mind u all 3 tables still sitting in restaurant. I get to the car to hopefully enjoy my no lamb no biriani food... Napkins on top of bag are bathroom napkins. Fork knife salt pepper pkg has old splattered food (not wet-dried on).  Ok I'll get my extra fork out of the glove box... I break open flat bread pkg.  Cooked on 1 side other side doughy  tastes sweet.    Soup with bits of bread is great - is like a tomato soup on steroids. Yum. Ok. I drink that cause I don't hv a clean spoon.  Basmati rice yummy has little seeds in it.. I'm sure u foodies know what .. Very good. Ok looking up...  Tikka, open it up pour on some rice.  1 couple leaves restaurant. 2 tables still left inside. Taste. Eh where is the medium high heat?  Is creamy but not very flavorful .   I cut into chicken, having t hold the Togo plate so it all doesn't spill n it is that opaque white, almost punk but not, chicken color .   Can't eat my tikka till I get hm t warm it up. They had a rating of 94... I guess I will just hv t throw it away.  Still no Indian cuisine ... 1 yr n counting.   Sad in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The location is prime (but parking is ample), so it's a smart strategy to \"dumb down\" the food so it appeals to more people, taking advantage of the location. Which is why I think Copper is good, but not great.   There were no Asian people in there, other than the wait staff. Bad sign in my book but this ara of Charlotte is not known for it's Asian population, so maybe not a bid deal.   The mixed drinks were great and the wine list extensive, much more impressive than I expected.   My wife and I ordered the masala cauliflower flourets, saag paneer and lamb kofka, with a side of paratha.  The flourets were perfectly cooked and crisy but the sauce was a little ketchupy.  The saag paneer was delicious, nothing more to say there.  Lamb was cooked perfectly but again the sauce was a little ketchupy and wasn't as spicy as I had hoped.  Paratha was very good, flaky and thicker than I've had in the past.   I would go back and take people who are not accustomed to Indian food, this could certainly open their palate. But i would not return.   My past experience is based on an old favorite place called Lal Qilal in Arlington Heights, IL. I was a regular and never once saw a white person there. Very authentic place with food that was extraordinary.   Copper was good for Charlotte, but not great overall. Blue Taj in Ballantyne is better."}
{"text":"I just don't know what the problem is with everybody's reviews ... our service was fabulous very attentive and welcoming. Halfway through our service the table that sat next to us had nasty stank cologne on and we couldn't breathe. the wait staff was awesome about moving us. All of our food was exceptional.  the appetizer was CHICKEN-PEPPERCORN -GINGER \"SUKKA\" spicy but awesome. for dinner we ordered GOAN PRAWN CURRY wow. And KASHMIRI CHILI-FENNEL ROASTED LAMB   Fantastic. Our server was Martin from India with a great funny attitude. We would recommend this restaurant to everybody"}
{"text":"So, I love Indian food.  I like Copper.  The good:  The dishes we tasted were delicate and well-seasoned.  The naan was traditional but also excellent, served to us relentless and continually by the best \"bread boy\" I've ever had.  Seriously - he was amazing.  I also had a great glass of wine.  The \"meh\":  I'd really like to be able to try their Indian-influenced dishes, which comprise the largest portion of their menu, but the vegetarian dishes are limited to their traditional menu.  This is fine but disappointing.  Although I enjoyed my meal very much, I thought it was significantly overpriced for what I had."}
{"text":"I made dinner reservations to celebrate a friend's birthday and I was very pleased. The service was good and my meal was excellent. I ordered chicken chettinadu, which had just the right amount of \"kick\" (spiciness) to it. The Naan was also very good. My friend had lamb curry which he enjoyed. I have been looking for a good Indian restaurant in Charlotte and I must say that this one is almost as good as my favorite in New York."}
{"text":"What a lovely place, menu and service!  The food was outstanding Indian and our server, Sanjay, made the total experience absolutely wonderful!  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Pulling up to the Copper we were immediately struck by the fact that it is a restored mansion, formerly the Mayor's and also the former home of Carson McCoullough, who wrote The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter.  Now, on to the food....  The appetizers wonderful! The fried cauliflower had great flavor and texture. The somosas had a flavoring tangy sauce. The entree of Lamb Curry had layers of complex flavors and the lamb was cooked to perfection. Very friendly owner and staff who gave us a tour of the former home of Charlotte's Mayor."}
{"text":"We love Indian food, so we were excited to try a new place. We were seated promptly, but then ignored for 10 minutes before even getting a drink. Our waiter was courteous, but never once addressed me or even looked at me. Everything was addressed to or presented to only my husband. This was infuriating to me. The food was good. A little different from other traditional menus, but very limited. We won't go back."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I have visited Copper. First when they opened...which I was truly disappointed. After a year and hearing many good things about it, I decided to try it again. I am GLAD I did. The place isn't much from the outside, an old house maybe from the 20's. The inside kind of shows, but it works. Dim lighting and rather tight seating, Definitely recommend reservations with large groups or on special nights out. Service was great. Meal was fantasric......orderd Lamb kebab's and samosas for app. Chicken Tikka and Panner with garlic naan as dinner. The spice level was a little bland for my taste, so next time I will have to specify the heat level. Naan I was a little disappointed in...a little cold and chewy. Had kulfi for dessert. Good dinner but set me back a Ben Franklin. Because of that I will visit but not as often!"}
{"text":"Not a place for date nights. Nothing upscale about this Indian restaurant. Food was good but bad ambience. Tables are too close and our experience was ruined by a loud table. Careless response from the manager when provided feedback."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Copper on a Friday night around 7.  Summary: Unnecessarily snooty. Cool atmosphere, good food. Expensive for what it is. I may go back but I can live without it.  Do you have a reservation? No? Then let us confer while you wait anxiously for a ruling on whether or not we will grant you a seat in our mostly empty restaurant.  [time passes]  Ok. We have decided we will seat you at the worst table in the restaurant, just around the corner from the front door and across from us. So we can watch you. Be sure to take in all the empty tables around you, especially the ones with windows and views of East, as penance for not making a reservation.  Reservations for a place that's empty? That's a little self indulgent.  [What went down]  Our waiter was very kind and attentive and made some great recommendations.  The meatball appetizer was amazing. I'm not a big lamb fan but these things were good. The sauce is super spicy and spectacular. The mango and grapefruit on the side is superfluous.  My husband had the Bottle Masala Gosht. It was only ok.  My chicken tikka masala was tastetastic. Though I don't find it materially better than the frozen chicken tikka masala meal from Trader Joes. $3 at home, or $15 with a side of shame?"}
{"text":"We loved the ambiance, location and food. It was an awesome experience. The food was rightly spiced as indicated, the variety was good and portions were large enough.   Update: The portion size has decreased considerably compared to last time"}
{"text":"First thing - Prices are very high....and quantity is very less. Secondly- I ordered veg biryani and I told spicy . I never tasted that much spicy.and I can't even tell me them it is spicy because they are pretty straight forward and no friendly so I can't talk any thing. And at last after everything the guy started justying and teaching me about spice levels.  Last thing is I don't don't don't recommend this."}
{"text":"I finally tried Copper and I wish I had tried it sooner. The food is a work of art as the flavors are just amazing. The service was just right, always there when you needed them but not too intrusive that you can't keep a conversation going. Looking forward to being back."}
{"text":"I'd say about 2.5 to three stars. It's a trendy Indian restaurant, with lighting so dim at night that they actually give you a small flashlight to read the menu. You'd think that would be a hint to them but oh well. I was in town for business and someone recommended this place. The food was good, but they didn't ask me for my preferred level of spicyness, so my curry dish came out quite spicy. But, it was very good. The menu is pricey: most dishes cost around $19."}
{"text":"This is the first Indian restaurant I have been to since moving to Charlotte 8 months ago.   I heard it was good and when I checked out their website, the menu looked interesting.  You don't see the prices listed there, though, and there is a reason.  They're high, especially for Charlotte.  I dropped almost $70 all-in for dinner, but the food was so good I thought it was worth every dollar.  It was a classic case of getting what you pay for.  And the atmosphere, as part of a historic house, was the nicest I have ever seen in an Indian restaurant.  Since I was alone, I sat at the small but very nice bar.    I ordered two glasses of a very tasty Riesling, the Gunpowder prawns, and the \"modern\" scallop entree, both of which appeared to have so many weird ingredients I wasn't sure how I would react to them.  I needn't have worried, since both the appetizer and entree were among the most delicious of their general type that I have had anywhere.  I also got a serving of garlic naan, which was terrific, though I took most of it home with the amazing basmati rice that came also.    This is not your typical Indian restaurant.  It's avant-garde, it's unusual, it's a Carolina adventure.  Most of all, it's amazing."}
{"text":"We have only been here once, on a trip to Charlotte.  We sat at the bar and were impressed with the bartender, Jarisa.  She was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu.  We tried a couple of appetizers, one with chicken and one with lamb. They were both very good, seasoned richly and to perfection.  For our main course, we shared the lamb vindaloo.  Soooo good.  The lamb was not gamey tasting at all, and the spice was good, although not for wimps--hot!  It's not on the menu, but they will make it if you ask.  Overall, a great time."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at this establishment Saturday night (01/29/2010) for the Queen's Feast Restaurant Week. For my first visit I loved the ambience, the service and all 3 courses of the meal presented. I had heard wonderful things about this restaurant and the lived up to each one of them plus more. The flavors were awesome for the moderately priced food with upscale taste. The menu for restaurant week was a special menu, but I say ask for the cocktail called a Narada, hopefully the bartender will make it for you. Great place and I'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. Love the modern Indian dishes. Great location as well. Will definitely return! Request Neal; great server."}
{"text":"The menu is not at all clear. They say fruit salad for 3 pieces of fruits and meatball platter for one meatball. Menu should say the serving sizes. Waiter says its upscale resturant. I don't know how upscale and menu are related."}
{"text":"This was my first time back in a few years. It was early as we had some show tickets. THe place was less than half full. The staff was adequate and the service was characterized as slow and quite frankly not very friendly. I am accustomed to be happy to see me come in and spend my money. The AC was not working so well or not turned down. The place was a little toasty. The food was ok, I should have trusted some of the reviews, cauliflower was over sauced. I had a paneer entree and it was good but not $100 for two good, more like good on a nice lunch time Indian Buffet for $12.95 a head. Wait staff was not heplful it was like they wanted to be somewhere else.. Had to beg for our orders of Nan and it came halfway through the entree. By the time we left the place was jumping. I'll bet their service was really bad and the place even warmer. I would go back of someone else wanted to go to be polite, the food was ok, but the entire experience was just not up to the price. Two glasses of wine, two entrees, two appetizers $120 and no one said Thank you. That's alot."}
{"text":"great indian food! they have a little different menu from the ordinary indian places, they have a lot of  \"modern dishes\" which is basically they put a little twist to the traditional indian dishes!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Zagat's and Yelp as we were traveling southward. We'd already planned a stop in Charlotte, so we thought this sounded great. It's in a beautiful early 20th century home, nicely set back from the street and with a nicely decorated interior (a lot of - ahem - copper in the decorations). SO - a nice first impression.  We read that their specialties are Indian and Indian/fusion, so (since we have a lot of good Indian fare not far from us) we both went with the fusion-y side of the menu. The bread (I can't now recall what it was - naan-like, with fillings) was delicious, and the main courses were both really good. Again, I waited too long to post, and I don't recall what we had; my husband really liked his, probably fish - mine (probably chicken) was good, but I felt a little let down - I'd hoped for more oomph and flavor.  Portions were reasonable, prices high but not out of line. Setting is fabulous - elegant, romantic. Definitely liked it, would go again (but I might go for Indian food this time instead of fusion - it smelled wonderful)."}
{"text":"Not a regular indian restaurant. Fusion.  Ambience: 5/5.   Chettinadu curry - good for 2 persons.  Need to try all items here."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service. My husband and I come here once in a while for date night.  Worth visiting!"}
{"text":"I'll preface this that I'm not the most adventurous eater and Indian food is usually not at the top of my list, but Copper is.  The service has always been great and the food is great.  I've had the chicken tikka masala and the modern chicken tikka.  I still prefer the chicken tikka masala, but wouldn't turn down either!  Also, all the naan you could ever want!"}
{"text":"We love going to the homes in the area set up as restaurants. Out with friends, it was a nice place to go and a good place for people not to savvy with Indian food. Had the naan in all 3 flavors, my best was with just butter & garlic. Chicken Tiki Masala was good but I had better in the little dive restaurant in Ballantyne.  They did make special dishes for our good friend with gluten & dairy allergies.  The service was great and had a nice experience overall."}
{"text":"Chicken ordered 3 times and here is the problem:  1- rice not cooked long enough, has a crunch to it  2- chicken is cut too big \" huge \" and actually hard to cut into which is basically under cooked plus an indication of a bad / poor quality chicken.  This dish which is considered an essential on Indian cuisine menu. Fix it!"}
{"text":"Amazing ambience and delicious food..  Its just a perfect combination.  Menu is very concise, too less options."}
{"text":"Good solid food in an upscale setting.  We ate at Cooper on Memorial Day so it wasn't very busy.  We received excellent service and left very satisfied.  The spinach soup was too watery for my taste, but my son ate two bowls!  Wow!  Anyway, the chicken in both our entrees was a little dry (I noticed others have mentioned this also), but the flavors were spot on and made up for the issue with the chicken.  I have been craving Indian food ever since!"}
{"text":"Rude service. I will never go back again. The food is also modified for whites, believe me it is not Indian food. The waiters have no manners."}
{"text":"If you love Indian food, there are much better choices in Charlotte. The food here is respectable, but only quasi-Indian."}
{"text":"Food and service are excellent here. They take the time to explain the different dishes and what they mean as well."}
{"text":"In a strange turn of events - I found myself at Copper twice in two weeks after years of living in charlotte and never actually getting to eat here. Once for lunch and another time for Dinner.   As for the food:  I understand from my Indian friends that this is not the 'best, best, best' Indian place int the city. How ever, Not being and expert in indian food I found both of my meals to be quite delicious. I had different varieties of Masala on both occasions and enjoyed very much what I had.  The service:  I have to say that this is where Copper shined the brightest. On both occasions the staff was extraordinarily helpful and attentive in helping my party figure out what to order. They were very consultative and checked on us after tasting our food to confirm that we were happy with our choices. To me, this is the reason for my 5 star rating. I have have been to other Indian places, left to fend for myself and hated my order. Not so with Copper - it's truly a place where I felt comfortable ordering and knowing what to expect.   All in all - I give it 5 stars.   The staff really makes this place special."}
{"text":"LOVE this cute little place!  I've been here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch and both time everything was fantastic! The place is so cute too :) The servers are always great and super helpful.  The tikka masala and Cauliflower is SO good!!   Definitely my go to Indian restaurant!!"}
{"text":"It's not a typical Indian restaurant as conveyed by th e person serving the food.  Prawn was good rest everything was #$%##%# .  Will not visit this place again, if u wana come then come just for the ambiance. Giving 2 stars bcoz of ambience and staff."}
{"text":"So, I LOVE Indian food. Then why have I lived in Charlotte for so long and never tried Copper? Well, for one there's Woodlands and it's basically perfect and why go anywhere else? But also because I'm intimated by the fancy and let's be honest, I'm super duper CHEAP!  I finally decided to give Copper a try when my main homie, Rachel B. informed me that  http://http://www.restaurant.com/  basically always has a coupon for them. $10 for $25 worth of food, but with a minimum purchase of $37.50. GET ON THAT!  Freshly printed coupon in tow, my boyfriend and I headed over to Copper super early (5:30pmish) to beat any Thursday night dinner crowd there might be. The place wasn't crowded and there was plenty of seating inside and out. But when we walked up to the hostess stand they asked if we had reservations. Me: \"umm, no? do we need them?\" // host: \"no, but typically it's best to have them\" // me: \"well, can you accommodate us then? // host: \"well, yes. follow me...\"   I don't know why it rubbed me the wrong way, it just did.  Moving on, Copper is basically a big Victorian style house made into a modern, upscale restaurant. Lots of candles, white table cloths, etc. They even put your napkin on your lap for you!!!  I've eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants, but even i was a little intimidated by the menu (or maybe it was all the meat dishes I didn't understand). I had to double check with the waiter and make sure everything I was interested in was vegetarian, because it wasn't clearly indicated. Which, the server seemed a little annoyed by. Oh well.   We were given a complementary trio of sauces: a sweet mango lassi style, a yogurt based, and a mint based sauce. They were all delish, but the mango was my favorite. The only thing is, the only gave us one piece of naan each. I had to waste the rest of the sauce sampler because we didn't get enough bread to finish it with. What's with that??  We had the Samosas as an appetizer. They were good, but way too small... like little golf balls. 2 for $7? Please...  My boyfriend ordered the Scallops dish off the Modern menu. He was very pleased with his selection. He loves big scallops and he gave these two thumbs up. $23 dish.  I ordered the Goat Cheese-Vegetable \"Roasted Koftas\" also off the Modern menu. $17 dish. AMAZING!!!! The dish came with three little koftas, the size of fingerling potatoes. They were plump and packed full of flavor.  On top was a \"mixed vegetable tarkari\". I'm still not sure which veggies they were  (they were julienne cut into thin strips), but I was pleased. The real shining star of this dish was the bed of sauce listed on the menu as \"tomato-honey-fenugreek\". SO SO SO SO SO GOOD. So many rich flavors going on, it was like an explosion on my palette. The dish was a little spicy, but not crazy, just right.   We split two orders of bread: garlic naan and saffron kulcha. The garlic naan ($3) was pretty basic, yummy, but nothing phenomenal. The kulcha ($7) was surprisingly bland for it's ingredients: saffron, almonds, and paneer. Hmm.   Overall, I was super impressed with my main course, but not my appetizer or bread. The food was delicious, but WAY OVERPRICED (Our total before coupon was $57!!). You basically pay for the atmosphere here, so make it a special occasion to celebrate and birthday, reunion or raise.  We'll be back maybe, but it'll probably be a while til we can save up for an \"fancy\" night again."}
{"text":"Lunch today at Copper was really good.  Parking was very convenient...no reservation required at this very popular restaurant.  Started out with a nice fresh salad...followed by the Amritsari Garlic Chicken appetizer.  Oh my goodness it was so good with the raita.  I had the Chettinad with chicken.  Oh so delicious and full of flavor.  It had a little hint of spice...and the chicken was cooked to perfection!  The lunch was served with rice and naan.  Service was very good!    I am looking forward to another trip to Copper very soon!!!"}
{"text":"if you dont like bad ass indian food, then dont come here...the garlic naan was freakin delish, chicken tikka masalla was simply flavorful and juicy like my wermens...and the service was impeccable  on the pricey side for dinner and indian food in my opinion but well worth it, ill be coming here for some lunch time meals and to help put me to sleep when i get back to work...three words yummo  i would had given this place 4 stars but i was not expecting this in charlotte..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! I've started going at lunch on work days so much that they recognize me now :)"}
{"text":"The food had great flavor.   My 'modern' scallop dish was delicious and perfect with the Riesling we had chosen. The samosas were yummy, but difficult to eat. The exterior could not be cut with a fork or a knife. I had to break it apart, at which point the stuffing went everywhere. Once all the disparate elements were recombined, they tasted wonderful, but I am not a fan of food that is prepared without thought as to how it will be eaten. Perhaps they were fried for way, way, way too long?  The service was abominable. Our unfriendly waiter mumbled the entire time he was at the table, offered no guidance or insight to menu, all of our dishes were auctioned off (at a two top!), dirty silver was left on the table, and the check was tossed onto the table after we paid. Seriously. While standing behind my right shoulder, he tossed the check presenters onto the table and walked off. Unbelievable and inhospitable."}
{"text":"Copper is perfection.  Everything is so flavorful and bold.  Plenty of spice.  Other Indian restaurants make their food too bland to appeal to more people.  But Copper gets it just right.  Incredible food.  Impeccable service, and they frequently update the menu so there's always something new to try!  Plus plenty of vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"I know I'm supposed to type longer reviews, but I can sum up with: ick. Waited 45 min with reservation (for a 4-top), service was terrible from the hostess to the food runners, SUPER expensive for what you get, and the food was HORRIBLE. Samosas so burnt they tasted like coal and were hard on the teeth, fish so overcooked my knife couldn't carve thru it, and all served on gigantic plates so there was no room to maneuver. (I think the chef was trying to pull off some sort of food art, but just ended up with confusion on my plate.) Too much good Indian in Charlotte to spend SO much money for...ick."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food. Consistently delivers great food & service. I have yet to be let down by Copper. The staff is very friendly & informative. Be sure to ask enough questions about the dishes & spice levels so you know what your getting. Love the food here!"}
{"text":"Tikka Masala is easily the best thing to get here and I don't usually get tikka. Excellent food, nice waiters, and cool environment. Highly recommend Copper!"}
{"text":"This is great date place or place to go if you're looking to spend some dough. I'm not an Indian food fan but have been a few times since they offer both traditional and modern Indian food. I like that I am able to find something different each time and the meal has been tasty each time I've gone. The servers have been very knowledgeable and happy to help but it takes forever to get your tab. I think they have great food but for me personally, a tad out of my budget and overpriced. Awesome beer selection as well."}
{"text":"This place is located in an old house that looks pretty run down from the outside, but the inside is cozy and well decorated. It was very loud when we arrived and never really got quiet even after the room cleared out. The floor and walls seem to amplify the sound.   We had scallops and garlic naan for our appetizer. The scallops were a little too chewy but the sauce and spices mostly made up for it. The garlic naan was buttery and garlicky, as it should be.  Our main course was murgh tikka masala. We ordered it \"indian hot\" but it was pretty bland. The chicken seemed dry even though it had been sitting in sauce for at least a few minutes before we touched it.  The service was attentive and kept our naan and water filled. I had trouble hearing anything the waiter was saying but I think it was more due to the general cacophony of the room rather than his quiet voice.  As far as Charlotte goes, Copper is pretty good. It doesn't really compare to Indian food elsewhere but you can't be too choosy when in North Carolina."}
{"text":"This has been the most user-friendly Indian meal I've ever had.  Now, although I've grown up a bit since high school and my taste buds have matured along with it, I often find Indian foods overwhelming.  Sometimes all I'll taste is cumin and coriander and that just doesn't do it for me.  But here at Copper we got a chicken tikka masala dish which was awesome and delicious, kind of like juicy chicken in an Indian influenced cream of tomato sauce.  The seasoning was subtle.  I also greatly enjoyed their shrimp and coconut dish, which I suppose was less than authentic but just had a wonderful grilled flavor.  And you probably have to deliberately screw up garlic naan in order for it to be bad.  Luckily they did not do so.  I didn't care for the rice - my view on rice as a side, especially to food as seasoned as Indian food, is that its supposed to kind of be the simple carb that you can use to mellow out your food if need be.  This rice was super cuminified, so I didn't care for it as a side. Samosas were crispy on the outside and tasty. The cauliflower appetizer was also savory and delicious. Service was impeccable, attentive and extremely friendly.  Overall I wouldn't mind coming back.  At least, I'm not afraid to return."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Charlotte.  It is not the typical Indian restaurant, but a modern take of Indian food.  I still tend to order off the traditional menu.  My favorite part is the naan and chutneys they give at the beginning of the meal.    I have also been for lunch and love their menu.  It isn't a buffet that is often found at Indian restaurants, which I do like.  However, here you are able to choose your protein and choose your sauce to create your own dish.  It comes out in a big bowl so for around $10, it's quite a deal.  This is the place I go to when I want a quiet bar to sit at and just enjoy a delicious meal by myself or one other friend."}
{"text":"Indian food is almost always expensive, so I won't even bother to complain about that.  But the food here is good and they accomodated a special request, so for that Copper gets high marks.    The SAMOSAs are as expected.  Potato and pea wrapped in a nice fried crunchy dough. The chutneys are tasty.  Nothing out of the ordinary or that you couldn't get anywhere else (or make at home).  CHICKEN CHETTINADU is not for the faint of heart (or palette).  My colleague was warned that the base was spicy, but she scoffed and said she loved spicy food.  Fast forward 20 minutes and there was sweat dripping from her forehead and her eyes and nose were watering.  I tasted the gravy, and thought it was great, but I didn't try to eat a bowl full of it.    All entrees are served family style, with rice added to the table.  We also got a bit of naan free but ordered extra with the meal.  No salt or pepper on the table, but they're happy to bring it if you ask.  The ZESTY VEGETABLE BHAJI side was interesting.  Long julienned pieces of mixed vegetables, including beets, all mixed with a dry spice rub.    The traditional vegetarian menu offers PANEER MAKHAWALA, which is a red gravy similar to tikka masala or butter gravy.  Very rich and flavorful but not too spicy. I asked to substitue cauliflower / gobi for the paneer, and the chef nicely complied.  Overall this was a very tasty and well balanced dish.    The service was great, and the interior of the restaurant (located in a very old rehabbed house) is unique.    For people looking for more Indian options, try the University area.  It's full of great Indian hole-in-the-walls.  My personal faves: Persis (everything is good, but the Gobi 65 is amazing), Tulips (varied weekend buffet and good a la carte ordering) and Passage to India (great gobi manchurian and weekend/lunch buffet)."}
{"text":"Mediocre overall and disappointed compared to previous visits. Waiter was arguing with a customer about check, she apparently didn't like her meal and he accused her of eating half so only took half off. Wow... Never saw a place do that before. They argued and as a result out table was ignored. Anyway, after 10 minutes we had to order drinks from someone else. Waiter made sarcastic remark, \"what? Are u in a rush or something?\" $10 Drinks arrived and were lame - CVa tasted of cheap sweet and sour mix and friends drink $11 tasted like tomato juice with a shot of creamer. Vegetable samosa $9 was clearly frozen and then baked or microwaved. Coconut and ginger veggies meal was bland and gloppy. Baked goat cheese looked pretty, but were not-quite-cooked-through samosa filling logs encrusted in uncooked bread crumbs. Couldn't tell where goat cheese was hiding. Garlic naan was very greasy and inedible. Rice was also very oily. Only eating about 1/3 of entrees we both felt full, likely from high fat content of meals. Likely won't return, at least not for a while. This is a shame since it was one of our favorite spots for Indian."}
{"text":"I came here last year and had a really good time. It's great Indian food, in a city where ethnic food is a rarity. I can't fault it there. Last time, the waiter wouldn't let us order \"Americanized dishes\" and made us order real Indian food, which was fantastic. The staff here is always quirky and charismatic, which goes a long way towards making a meal.  This would have been a 5 star review except for two points. Firstly, your extra room in the back doesn't have the charm (or noise absorbance) of the main restaurant. It's nice but not as good, and that means that sitting there is a letdown. Secondly, my girlfriend told you that she was allergic to nuts. You should have warned us that our desert contained cashews, pistachios, and almonds. We spent the night in the emergency room.  I would give a lower rating if your food wasn't absurdly delicious."}
{"text":"Tried Copper for the first time this week and it was good. I had high expectations after reading all the reviews, but needless to say, it's just A-OK for me. The big brother/sister to Blue Taj in Ballantyne, I was expecting a step up in all facets of the experience. Unfortunately, the only thing that was higher was the price. Yes, it's a little expensive, but the ambiance and feel of Copper is great. Outside of the putting green steps you enter in on, the restaurant is beautiful. Try to sit in the enclosed porch area as there's more light.   Started out with some garlic naan. For $3, not bad at all. It was tasty and the 3 sauces it's served with were a plus! Kept thinking if the regular bread was free though as I saw it served around the other tables...hmmm...oh well. Then we went for the Samosa, which was good, but I expected some more spice. The sauce it was served with was good and necessary. I went with a traditional dish of tikka masala, which was priced at $17. I thought it was good, but it was the exact same dish in flavor and size that I had at Blue Taj for lunch and it was $10. It's a traditional dish, so I shouldn't expect much variation. I also had some of my wife's scallop dish. The flavor was good, but the scallops were a tad undercooked in my opinion.   We had a restaurant.com coupon so the price was great. The reviews of it being pricey are correct, but the dishes, like my tikka masala are definitely able to split. If I go back again, that will be considered more in the ordering."}
{"text":"My hubby and I are big fans of Indian cuisine, we've tried a lot of restaurants and finally got to trying Copper.   The ambiance was great! service was excellent!   Every first time we go to an Indian restaurant we try the Tika masala chicken. At copper the Tikka Massala presentation looks great!! however, I've tried better versions of Tika Masala here in Charlotte (the university Indian place). That's the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5, everything else they excelled in!  The appetizer was great! they gave me hot tea which was REALLY good :)  Must try restaurant :)"}
{"text":"This place is great. The location is perfect to start with. The food is so good without losing all of the authenticity. The rice is cooked with cumin. The saks dressing made me want more.  The Naan is fresh.  You must try this!"}
{"text":"I returned to Copper last night, this time my partner rather than a friend.  It provided a nice conversation place previously with my friend, but this time served as a romantic date night setting.  My partner had never been to Copper and was equally impressed.  The lighting is perfect in this converted old house.  It's subdued, creating a relaxing and romantic atmosphere.  Hushed Indian music plays in the background.    We sat in the \"red room.\"  The walls are entirely painted in fire engine red.  The lighting is low there, too, so you're not blinded by the bold use of color.  The only problem I found with this room was that halfway through our dining experience, a large group was sat at a long table in there.  Being that it's a square room with four walls, the sound of their voices was a bit too much.  It dampened the romantic aspect a bit, but that's not Copper's fault.    We didn't know what half the stuff on the menu was, so we picked and chose.  It turned out we chose very well.  We wanted a bread, but weren't sure which of the five to choose from.  We went with the $3 garlic Naan.  Turns out, it was the same bread they bring you to the table anyway...with garlic.  It was still good, though, and we still had leftover sauces from the first bread they brought us.  One was a marmalade, another a creamy corn something-or-other, and the last (and my favorite) was a mint leaf one.    To add to our Indian repertoire, we added an appetizer.  We wisely chose the Paneer, after inquiring what it was (an Indian cheese).  Not just any cheese, though, it was cooked in wide rectangular strips (it doesn't melt) and coated in Indian spices.  Can I just say, \"YUM?\"     Copper offers entrees in both \"traditional\" and \"modern\" choices.  This time around, we went with modern.  Each of us tried a chicken dish.  One with a lot of Indian spices accompanied by roasted peppers and the other with a coconut-lime sauce accompanied by green beans and peas.  Both came out with extremely generous portions of chicken.  We were SO impressed by the size of the meat.   It allowed us to swap half for half to sample both dishes and still have our own good-sized portion of what we ordered.  Naturally, both were extremely flavorful and juicy.  The peppers on the side were good, but the green bean and pea concoction was out of this world.   I could have eaten a bowlful of it.  I don't know if it was the spices or the coconut-lime sauce that made it so good, but even if you didn't like vegetables, you would love these.    We enjoyed the atmosphere, prices, and food portions at Copper MUCH better than our previous experience at Blue earlier this week, spent $40 less, AND I got a glass of fine red wine.  Copper gets my recommendation to out-of-town friends and guests each and every time.    Lastly, we were able to easily book a reservation for a busy Saturday night online at their website using OpenTable.  How much better can it get?"}
{"text":"Visiting and decided to check it out despite the mixed reviews here - very glad I did!  It's in an old house which has an interesting juxtaposition of decor, shall we say, against the historic feel of the house, but still nice and comfortable.  They were accommodating and the meal came out quickly for us:  Murgh Tikka Masala: delicious and lovely with plenty of sauce (yum) and nicely cooked chicken Saag Paneer: By far the best I've ever had - I could not get enough Lamb Kozhambu: On the (good) spicy side but imo not as great as the MTM  Overall assessment - try it.  If you're unsure about a dish, just ask.  If you're nice, they'll be nice back :)"}
{"text":"We had the samosas which were great! The only thing they missed were a little sauce, but they were good regardless. We split the tikka masala and saag paneer which were both fantastic. We were stuffed. Service was incredible. The waiter was genuinely interested in the other types of food we like to explore. He gave us spicier tips for the next time we come to eat. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Copper has the best saag (spinach) I've ever eaten. Its on the smaller vegetarian menu as saag paneer (with cheese) but you can order without as I did - though it is still traditionally made with cream/milk for vegans or lactose intolerant. The serving size was large. I had roti with the saag which was also great. My wife had chicken tikki masala and loved her dish as well. I didn't get any appetizers (so I can't comment on them) which worked out since my meal was so large."}
{"text":"The BEST Chicken Tikka and Saag that I have ever had!! EVER! Every time I go to Charlotte I will eat here!"}
{"text":"Killer setting.  Killer food.  Killer low-key sitar soundtrack.  Get it,copper.  Get it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. The atmosphere is intimate and great, everything you order is amazing, and the staff is the best.  My favorite dishes: appetizer the samosas and then entree is the chicken tikka Marsala.  My best friend and I use to come here pretty frequently to the point where our waiter memorized our order. I moved away from Charlotte 2 years ago and was in town visiting and of course had to come here while in town. My best friend and I went. We had the same waiter and to this day he still remembers us and our same order."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong: it's good food. Totally delicious. But I have to say that's it is a bit pricey for what it is. We loved the food but the check was a shocker considering our menu choices.  Do get the cauliflower tikka masala appetizer. That was our FAVORITE of the meal."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is excellent but it's incredilby expensive. Two people was $60, and I don't even think that included alcohol. Worth it, but be prepared to spend a lot."}
{"text":"My second visit to Copper and I was just as pleased as the first time!  We went for dessert after the South End Gallery Crawl and sat at the bar to enjoy our cups of Massala Chai Tea and wait for our gelato.  We sampled pistachio, mango and passionfruit and they were creamy, flavorful and oh so good!   The wait staff once again were friendly, helpful and attentive from the hostess to the bartender.    Great place for a wonderful meal and definitely for dessert!  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"We mosied on into Copper for restaurant week. I've heard great things about Copper but had never tried it, and while I like Indian food, it's not something I normally gravitate towards, so without the Queen's feast encouragement, I'm not sure we would have gone, which would have been tragic!  Every person was a great representation of the restaurant - friendly and a pleasure to interact with. We were in an extreme rush, and they were very understanding with providing to-go boxes and trying to expedite service.  I started with the Cabbage-Black Beab-Asparagus \"Tikki-Chole\" - sort of like a bean burger. It was a good combination of flavors.   Next, I had the cod-bay scallop \"caldin\" - this was like a coconut curry soup with onions, snap peas, grapes, and baby scallops. This was delicious! I love coconut anything so it wasn't a surprise that I would order and love this dish. The scallops were a great accompaniment to the curry, and the side of rice gave a nice starch to help soak up all the flavor.   I wasn't crazy about the desserts - maybe because they weren't super sweet like I usually gravitate towards. I had the cacoa-chili kulfi, which I would describe as a mixture between ice cream and sorbet. It wasn't super creamy like ice cream, but had the texture of sorbet. It was more of a nice way to cleanse the palate, moreso than offer a sweet dessert. Not my thing, but it was one of only two options during Rest Week. My husband had the Tandoori T bone lamb with red wine mushrooms and Indian curry sauce. IT WAS SO GOOD! We ate every last piece around the bone, not wanting to waste a single bite. The manager shared that they were thinking about replacing the lamb chops with this T bone option. I don't think they could go wrong because it was so tender and flavorful. He mentioned they marinade it for 24 hours before cooking it. YUM!  I'm so glad I took the opportunity to try Copper during restaurant week. I would definitely recommend it to those who are more verse in Indian food and enjoy the flavor and spice combination. Beautiful atmosphere, in an older house too. It's so intimate and romantic, especially if you grab a seat by the fire with a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Summary - decent food, but not worth the average price on the menu. The atmosphere is trying to be upscale, but trying a little too hard. Overall it's a good restaurant, but if you are looking for authentic Indian food, it's not the place to go.   All in, it's another Charlotte restaurant that believes it's located in New York and should be charging New York prices for Charlotte quality food.   Take the 20 min drive from Uptown, go to Nirvana in Ballantyne instead and save yourself $50/person while having better Indian food."}
{"text":"This place is SO good. I'm so glad I finally had the opportunity to give them a try!   Just a quick note: Make a reservation! Don't be like me and think that you can just stroll in on a Tuesday evening and not have a wait. Next time....I'm making reservations.  But the wait was totally worth it!  We started with the samosas. Very good, just the right amount of spicy goodness. We also split an order of garlic naan. My goodness. It's warm and fresh with just the right amount of garlic...perfect for dipping. I loved every single bite. If you go this has to be on your list of items to try!   No seriously, the naan was so good that we ordered another round. Don't judge. It's just that good!   For dinner, I ordered the Tikki Masala. This is what dreams are made of folks! It was spot on with flavor and I asked for it \"spicy\" and it had just the right amount of kick.   My only gripe is that they are a bit pricey. However, if you can get there for lunch I hear the prices are better and the naan is included!   Overall, it was an excellent meal. And I'm already looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Best indian food in town. Menu is split between Traditional fare and fusion. Great location (Dilworth) doesn't hurt, and the old Victorian house it's in adds to it's ambience. The only downside -not the cheapest Indian food in town, but that being said - this is the place I take family & friends when they're in from out of town."}
{"text":"We recently went to Copper with some friends. Our friends fell in love with this place after a few visits, so my fianc√©e and I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Whenever I come to Charlotte we always find a good place to dine. Copper is located in the Dillworth area, the home of so many great restaurants. My fianc√©e didn't see Chicken Korma on the menu but they made it for her anyway. Chicken Korma is her favorite dish so that made our night. I ordered the Saag Chicken and to my delight it was perfection. All of our dishes were fresh and the service was great. If you love Indian cuisine this place is a must visit."}
{"text":"I love Copper. Love it. I have been 4 or 5 times and just adore it. It is Indian, but with a modern twist. It is fresh and everything is so flavorful. I went tonight with my husband and friends, and as always- excellent. I've been with groups of 4, 7 and 10 and each time the service has been wonderful.   My favorite thing on the menu is hands down the paneer. We tend to get several dishes between appetizers to entrees and split them up family style. I also tend to let my husband or his friend, who is Indian, order the food and just surprise me. Tonight we had chicken tikka masala, paneer, and a spicy coconut veggie bowl. Again, didn't catch the official names of these, but they're obvious on the menu. We also started with a lamb crostini thing, the cauliflower bites and scallops. Wow. I could make a meal on those three things over and over.   We opted out of dessert this time, but it's great. Recommend the chocolate cake! Also the wine selection is awesome and every time we have tried something different.   If you're around East Blvd/Dilworth area and haven't checked this place out, do yourself a favor and put it on your list. It is a little nice, maybe $40/person if you're doing apps+entree+wine, but 100% worth it. Especially if you've never tried Indian food and have been curious, this is the place to start. The waiters are able to guide and steer you and can try to accommodate based on your spiciness preference."}
{"text":"The service here is trash. As previous reviews have noted, it's really, really bad.   Be warned-- you can expect being completely ignored by the entire waitstaff, especially your waiter, while you're here. The food is probably good-- might be worth it, might not be.   It took over 30 minutes for our drinks-- not even alcohol, just basic drinks-- to get here. Waiter can't answer a simple question like what I ordered or how long my food will be. One of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in a while. Never going back."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was good! It's certainly not your more traditional Indian food and on the high end of price for Indian food but given the options for Indian food in Charlotte, I would definitely say this is the place to go. Samosas were well flavored. Chicken tikka masala was pretty good with a basic portion size. Service was excellent and ambience is very nice. It's situated in a renovated house with a parking lot so you don't have to deal with a garage or track down street parking."}
{"text":"There's no mistaking how good the food is. Flavors range from light and subtle to rich and hearty.  The naan appetizer comes with three delightfully different sauces.  I had chicken two different ways for the appetizer and entree.  And the refined Halwa cake dessert was a classic and authentic finish, the flavor of which brings me back to the cheap and delicious indian food of my college days.  One star deduction for overly dark lighting.  I like to be able to see my food and napkin and there's more to romance than being dimly lit.  And the line in front of the single occupancy bathroom was a little disappointing, as were the uncomfortably hard chairs and the wait to get the bill.    But overall a very pleasant experience.  Highly recommended for an elegant night out, albeit with a grain of patience.  ************************ After visiting a few times and having trouble with digestion, I had to be reminded of the difference between vegan and vegetarian.    Vegan means no animal products - so no dairy or eggs.  Vegetarian means eggs, milk or cheese could still be in it.  I love eggs, but milk and cheese don't love me.  There is cream in the rice, cream in the nan, and all of their chicken is marinated in yogurt, so no chicken dishes for me.    But most of the lamb dishes are non-dairy and roti is a wheat version of nan that has no milk or cream in the batter.  Problem solved, if you're lactose intolerant but like meat, don't order like a vegetarian.  Order like a vegan carnivore and you'll dine like a king."}
{"text":"Started with guns powder shrimps and we got 4 shrimps for 11$..that was ridiculous..but then we ordered chicken murgh malai which was yummy and also dessert gajar ka halwa with rabdi was delicious..  Overall food is good and awesome but prices are bit expensive.. please check out their Menu before you go :)"}
{"text":"Even if you think you don't like Indian food, you will love this place. Brought many people from my office here who were hesitant on eating Indian food and now they ask when are we going back.   I recommend going here for lunch over dinner, because you get a better deal for the price. Dinner gets a little expensive. Venue is one of those interesting houses on east bvd...with a nice outdoor seating area. Great atmosphere on the inside, nice authentic servers, and interesting music throughout your experience there. Think I heard some club music once...but hey it got you ready to eat some naan and rice.   They have traditional and modern options on the menu. I stick to the traditional dishes, which is pick a sauce with a protein. You get soup or salad with that, as well as much rice and naan you could possibly eat. Having tried all of the sauces, which are all good, my favorite two are the tikka Masala and the vin d' alho (spicier dish). If it's your first time try the tikka masala, the sauce is unbelievable. You won't want to stop eating it...especially when you dip your naan in there. I make sure I make it there at least once a month...sometimes more. Trust me you'll love it."}
{"text":"Updating by one star because it was better this time! Still not the best Indian food I've ever tried, but it's pretty good.   Let's get down to the food: The chicken in the chicken tikka masala is plainly marinated separately from the sauce and combined later, so the sauce doesn't really permeate the chicken well. The lamb is cooked well but isn't the best quality meat. The tamarind flavored lamb needs a little more garlic or tomato or some acid. The cauliflower appetizer was AMAZING and I would eat 3 servings of it for dinner any day of the week. Their potli samosas are special because of the beet chip and yummy dipping sauce. High five for appetizers!  As for the dranks: good wine selection, but none of the cocktails were interesting enough to pique my curiosity.   Didn't bother with dessert this time because it was so terrible last time. I'll probably stick to that approach in the future.   Next time I come back (and I will be back!), it will certainly not be during restaurant week as the food was better on a regular day. They could use better lighting in this joint but the wall art is fantastic. I also love their love affair with brightly colored binder clips."}
{"text":"Incredible food, service and selection.   Granted the location is in a old house, it is far from a take it lightly place.   I am from NYC, Indian and love food. And this place in Charlotte blew my mind. I loved everything i ate. I ordered from the moden menu and the dish tasted amazing. My coworker oredered off the classic menu and was raving too. We took a indian food virgin with us and he liked it so much he tried all the dishes we ordered. The restaurant got his seal of approval.   The waiter was helpful, served us dessert even after the kitchen closed. Which would make me give them the 6th star for high standard in customer service (but Yelp limits me to 5!).   I'm going back tonight as i dont think i will be able to find such Indian food back in NYC."}
{"text":"The best Indian in the Uptown area. Same owners as Blue Taj. A tad pricy. Entree, nann & a drink ($35).  Lunch specials are good deals, but personally I'm in food coma after Indian food! It's a bit of a fusion flare, but good portions & amazing flavor. The murg chicken & palak paneer are the best. Fresh baked nann (go garlic or go home)!  Atmosphere is dim lighting/romantic. Cute lil bar area & Jenn is awesome. Pretty nice selection of wines too!   Take my word for it, I'm Indian ;)"}
{"text":"It's not a proper Indian restaurant. It's an americanised Indian restaurant. The food is not proper Indian food with Indian spice. And the price is also more. Not worth if you want proper Indian food."}
{"text":"Copper is a good restaurant to go to, maybe I wouldn't go for someone's first try of Indian food, but for people who enjoy eating out and enjoy eating Indian food it is worth a try.  I went with two of my friends and we ordered a lot of food, but not a lot of booze and our tab was $180.  This was only three glasses of sparkling, no bottles of wine!  So I did feel a little sticker shock.  I would go back, maybe for a special occasion but I would much rather go get Indian take away and over order for $40 anyday!!!!  I guess the really important question is, \"how is the food\".  Delish and fresh tasting, made with care."}
{"text":"What a marvelous find! Great to get off the beaten path and into this charming restaurant with outstanding food! The samosas were fabulous. I fully enjoyed my tofu and vegetable curry while my husband picked a non-traditional lamb dish. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Great ambiance. Our waiter Mr. Neil gave impeccable service. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Indian cuisine and I've been wanting to check out Copper for some time now. Indian was on our radar this past weekend and Copper was the ticket. Boy, oh boy, am I glad we checked it out.   High notes:   Naan. Easily some of the best naan I've had in town. Served piping hot, holds a great chew, serves at the unparalleled vehicle for all things Indian. It was awesome.   Saffron Almond Paneer. This is a great passed plate and has tons of different flavors to choose from -- sweet, mild spice, herby. The paneer inside the naan was wonderful.   The whole traditional side of the menu is great. Plenty to choose from and definitely doesn't disappoint with the portions served. We were all thrilled with our entrees and shared plenty with one another. Which goes to show, the pricepoint with the given portion, in my opinion, is rather fair. They brought us so much extra naan, rice, and there was plenty for all of us to enjoy individually as well as share amongst the table.   Three of us made it out under $70 (no alcohol) and we were stuffed. The menu is definitely a bit pricier than other places in town -- Avg around $18/person. However, I wouldn't let the prices deter coming back at all. The amount of food, ambiance (the patio is gorgeous on a temperate evening), stellar/professional service, and location with ample parking makes the price per dish a non-issue. Or.....naan issue.   Looking forward to checking out their sister restaurant in Ballantyne -- The Blue Taj.   Cheers."}
{"text":"Really really good. A little different than most Indian cuisines that I had, but nevertheless probably one of the best Indian restaurants that I have been. The chicken sukka and sheekh kabab where delightful. The lamb kozhambu was perfectly spiced ."}
{"text":"Horrible guest and hospitality. Wish I could give a 0 or a negative star. I once showed up with shorts and sleeveless tees and the management got pissed off because of that and asked me to leave. Worst place ever and would never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Oh, my my my...No chutney ferrets here my friend. Very flavorful and well prepared traditional as well as more contemporary Indian dishes. Nice wine selection too. Staff is nice, location in historic house is cool too  Try something outside your comfort zone and be surprised."}
{"text":"Indian cuisine at it's finest. Literally. There are a handful of decent Indian restaurants in the area and I would say this is definitely one of the more upscale places to go. Great venue- served out of a remodeled home and VERY fancy interior! Outdoor seating. The food is pretty decent and their cocktails are impressive. Can be VERY pricy.   My only complaint is/ was service. The food prep and transit time is adequate, wasn't the issue at all. Apparently their staff thinks it's alright to tack on their mandatory 20% gratuity in the event you use any type of gift card, or discount. That's an initial check without mandatory gratuity, and a final check WITH one. Nowhere in their gratuity policy does it say anything about this, but of course they tell you it's how they do things. Shady. Congrats Copper, you just lost yourself a customer."}
{"text":"Cooper was a new experience for me although Indian food was not. Their concept is very entertaining offering both traditional and modern interpretations or new applications of old world flavors. I must stress the food is very nice but the service is not bad, it just was not the level to which I'm accustomed for this price range. We ordered the samosas and side salad which we split, Murgh Tikka Masala and Lamb Chops in Mustard Ginger marinade for our entrees.  The group we were sat near was quite loud which would not have been a problem if our waiter had spoken up. I had to ask him to repeat himself most of the evening. I was also disappointed he could not recommend a wine to pair with the Lamp Chops. A glass of Menage a Trois blend was quite nice by the way. Type A personalities may be more concerned that a runner brought our salad out as a second appetizer after the samosas (which are wonderful) when we had asked our server for to be served with dinner. The runner also failed to take away the empty samosa plate which cluttered the table. The food itself was excellent but those who put a premium on service should relax expectations."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious! I find portions are smaller than your average Indian restaurant though. Locations and building is beautiful, but when I have visited their AC was out and I ended up taking my food to go. It was mid-August and it was just too toasty to be eating in there. Overall a bit overpriced but the food is worth it.   4 star food 3 star - lack of AC"}
{"text":"For Indian food it is probably one of, if not the best restaurant in Charlotte. Yes the service is not very attentive and the prices are a bit high for Charlotte but the food is first rate."}
{"text":"Adorable place. It is located in a renovated Victorian house.  Indian food is not my favorite, but their Chicken Tikka Misala was very good and the staff is eager to please. We were seated at a table in a little nook by the window and it was very cute, comfortable and clean. Portions were good and the presentation of every dish was immaculate and creative.   Most everything is rather spicy, so if that bothers you, make sure to ask the staff about the level of spice in your dishes."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 3 times in last 6 months and have always enjoyed the food. The service is unparalleled and the carefully selected menu makes it easy. The dessert options are the best ..i almost come here to savor them..but today (07/25/17) its been a disaster ..the AC wasn't running and the food took forever.. By the way it was 90F outside.. Im sure u didnt learn tat ur AC wasn't working minutes before u started seating people. U barely had enough fans to place it around for ventilation.. worst case u had outdoor seating tat wasn't baking at 110F ..but u had no outdoor service ..i had to run out of the restaurant without enjoying my desserts becoz i was worried that  by the time it reaches the table it wuld melted away.. and my colleagues where kinda a running out of breath ..there is no excuse to wat happened today considering the price we pay ..u shuld have handled this better .. hope u wuld for the sake of the food u guys serve.."}
{"text":"This is a cuisine that I understand little about.  I have always been told how difficult Indian Cuisine is so difficult to prepare, the blending of the flavors and the raw ingredients along with the way the food is cooked and served.  That being said, Copper has this figured out no doubt.  Chicken Mirchi-Malai with the Garlic Naan and Rice was not only filling but had a great spicy profile that was matched by the rice and naan to \"cool\" down your tongue. There is a less  version that I did not try, but seen little reason too.  Go there enjoy one of the top 50 Charlotte Restaurants if 2017."}
{"text":"If you love Indian food ... Avoid this place. It is nowhere close to Indian cuisine ... I understand the creativity part of it but you cannot kill the concept at the expense of creativity. Drinks menu and ambience is what earned one star."}
{"text":"Had an incredible dinner here! The lamb curry and chicken Tika were phenomenal. Absolutely recommend copper!!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere in a great neighborhood, but the food itself was just - ok.  I had the seafood with saag (spinach sauce).  Decent flavor, but honestly nothing to write home about.  Guess I need to try more Indian food to fairly compare."}
{"text":"Best chicken tikka in the world! Soooooooooooo goood! It's heavy so I recommend bringing a supplemental digestive enzyme or two. I've never had better chicken tikka."}
{"text":"Copper has quite possibly the best Indian food that I have ever tasted.  I recently asked a colleague who is of Indian descent, which Indian restaurant has the best food in Charlotte.  He told me his favorite was Copper and he suggested that I go there for lunch.  I did and was truly impressed.  I had spinach soup along with naan and cheese with spinach.  All were great as was my server.  His recommendation was spot on and I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Yes, the food is very very tasty with a nice fusion complexity. But the portion sizes are so meager, I would not come back unless on a corporate expense account.  To illustrate: we got the garbanzo beans (channa)...For $12, they brought out about a dozen beans. Really? I don't understand gouging your customers when it costs a restaurant 50cents to make someone happy and full."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian Food!  I come here a lot for lunch and the service and food are very very good!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Its Indian-American fusion restaurant.... Naans are good, chettinad chicken is just ok.. Dessert and appetizers are over prized ...."}
{"text":"Terrible! I can't fathom why this is considered a classy restaurant. The main reason I disliked my meal here is that the food was just bland. If you advertise as an Indian restaurant, you can't have bland food, yet almost every dish I ate here was tasteless. The option to add spice to my food wasn't available. My great-grandmother is close to being fully disabled and can barely see but I am willing to bet any food critic that she can cook better Indian food than this \"top eatery\". The price isn't worth the wait nor the heartburn. Please just label yourself as an American restaurant and stop embarrassing people from the country of India. The only reason this place is popular is because of some dingus food critic who thought Indian food was supposed to taste like sand. I would rather feed my mother a week-old Subway sandwich than bring her here. She would probably die of a heart attack if she knew this was being advertised as food from India."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday for valentines day and i adored the food! its VERY flavorfull and yummy! you get to pick between two menus, traditional and modern. I would go for the chicken masala or the other chicken chartinodu (I believe?) they were both very yummy. Its pricey for my taste but i guess it deserves a twice a year visit  :P I also did not like the fact its VERY dark inside, i could barely read the menu. But the food is very great."}
{"text":"I was determined to find the best indian place in town during my visit in Charlotte. Despite the relative lack of options, Copper stood out with overall positive reviews.   The decor of the place was an intriguing mix of old and modern. The art on the walls added a exquisite taste to the ambience.   As for the food, i would not say this is the best indian food I've had. As a big fan of indian food and having traveled to India in the past, it was a bit disappointing as it had good reviews.   We ordered the samosas as appetizer and the saag paneer and chicken tikka masala as entrees. The starter soup and salad was mediocre at best, we would rather fill our bellies with the entrees. The samosas were flavorful, but the shape of it made it a bit difficult to consume, and the outside shell was too hard and did not do very well to contain the mash inside when split open.   I did love the saag paneer, which had a tangy twist and not too salty like some other curries. My sister disliked the texture of the slightly cooked onions, but I thought it added more flavor. I would have to say the saag paneer made the day! Unfortunately, the tikka masala wasn't very special, it lacked flavor and spice and the chicken wasnt noteworthy either, definitely not your smokey tandoori chicken pieces you find in some good tikka masalas. And the NAANS - never in my life have I seen such a thick naan...which is NOT good. Some pieces even reminded me of a pancake and were not crispy at all!   I would maybe give it another shot but would def come for lunch when they have decent prices.  I didn't think the portions weren't too small."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place, it's simply wonderful!  I've only gone twice for lunch and both times I had the Chicken Tikki Masala with naan and vegetable samosa's..........simply delish!  I had given up on Indian food until visiting Copper."}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice.first time we didn't like the service so we have chosen to take away and left.next time we went with prior booking we have ordered the tomato soup,shrimp curry with garlic naan. Tomato soup is too good but the curry is average for me but may be the people who likes coconut milk may like it much. Naan is very smooth and good.i felt that they have very limited options to choose in the menu."}
{"text":"Great place to eat good Indian food. I always get great service in the bar."}
{"text":"When I looked for an Indian restaurant in Charlotte, this was the first one that showed up on Yelp. It had good ratings from several reviews, so it was an easy choice.   We went here for lunch on Mother's Day; so we called ahead and made a reservation. We were told that we will be seated outside (in 100F weather). Ok, at least they were honest! We decide to push our luck and go there anyway (even though we did not want to eat in the heat), there were several tables available, and those tables did not get occupied for the entire duration of our lunch (which was about an hour and a half). What was all the \"show off\" about no indoor tables being available?   We get to ordering food, and we got Potli samosa and coastal masala prawns. They tasted good. We also liked the mango lassi. For entrees, we got Chicken Mirchi Malai, Paneer Tikka \"Kadai Paneer\" and the Konkan spiced vegetable. We split this between 5 people and the food was too much. We had leftovers. The portion sizes are quite large. We were not very impressed by the taste of the food, we have had better.   We liked their decor, an interesting part of their decor was the clove and the cardamom in the water inside their center pieces for the table. It is a pricey place, and quite honestly, if I am paying so much, I expect food that tastes better!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take folks to try Indian for the first time as the menu is not complicated and its easy to understand and the spices are mild so if you have a person who doesent love spicy this is a great place.  I had the Samosas and they were great and we tried the Saag and the Tikki Masala and both were great. Not the best Indian food but great flavor and cool location. I wish they had served the thin crispy bread with all the yummy dipping sauces? I was there at lunch so maybe they do at dinner? I would go back for sure. Parking was easy and service was good."}
{"text":"Great Indian Fusion"}
{"text":"We went to Copper on a Wednesday night and one person (in our group of 5) thought to call ahead. Apparently they couldn't seat us until 7:45 so we made a reservation for them, but when we arrived there were definitely tables available.   The service was ridiculously slow and my pregnant friend had originally wanted dinner at 7, so we were already starting off late. Garlic naan took 20 mins to come out, dinner took just over an hour, and then, we couldn't find anyone to get the check from. When they finally brought the checks, they double charged us for a side order of naan and an appetizer of naan, saying we were a large party. Um, what? Only one person ordered naan, the table didn't. We shouldn't have been charged for something we didn't order and that took like 5 mins to clarify. I also didn't like that gratuity was included for 5 or more, as the service was awful.  Food was fine, good vegetarian options at least. Flavor was good with the cauliflower but as other reviews have said, they were soggy. The samosas were also good, but expensive if you only get two. And the paneer tikka masala was also a small portion for such a high price tag (almost $20).   It's decent Indian food but for poor service, expensive prices, and small portions, I can take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went to Copper for the first time last and I absolutely loved it. It has the sweetest patio that would be a great backdrop for date night. However, I was there with a girlfriend. I enjoyed a few glasses of Malbec and girl talk but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Went here to celebrate with a friend. It's located in a super cute house and has a great evening vibe. We had the potli samosa for appetizer which had great flavor. I ordered the prawn curry for my meal and it was on point. It was spicy, but not overpowering. We couldn't stop dipping the garlic naan in it, which was also killer. My friend had the black sesame glazed chicken tikka which was also good, but I have to say I liked mine better because of the sauce! For dessert we rounded out with the kulfi and it was small but perfect for your sweet tooth without being rich or making you feel overly full. The service was great and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. We made it a date night on a monday night and it was quiet; maybe 1/3 full. It can get loud in there on the weekends, so I did not mind the ambiance. We try new dishes most of the time we go. My boyfriend ordered the dhana dal-curryleaf scallops with saffron scented leek-yukon-pear cr√®me sauce crisp leeks. I would not have thought that a pairing of pears and saffron would be so complimentary with seafood, but it certainly was! I went with the black sesame apricot-chili glazed chicken tikka with coconut orange sauce and shalgam-gajar mash. The chicken was sweet and spicy and the mash seemed to be made of carrots. So good. We ate on all that with a bottle of the Indian wine, Sula; a very summery and refreshing chenin blanc. BONUS!!!! I used my www.restaurant.com certificate that I got for super cheap to save $25 off the meal."}
{"text":"So Yay my review on Copper is the Review of the Day!! Since that is the case I thought an update might be in order.  My friends and I (a group of 8) came here for dinner on New Years Eve before our party. Service was still good although slow (however we had a large group so I'll let them pass on that). I will say that there was a disconnect between the bar and when we sat down. They tried to apply drinks to who they belonged to and couldn't quite get it right and it took forever to pay. That aside the food was still excellent! The samosas are still probably the best I've ever had. Did however try a new dish... Black Sesame-Apricot-Chili glazed chicken tikka with shaigam-gajar mash. The chicken was delicious and the mash the table was split on. Some said it was tasteless and others liked it. However this chicken dish is good for someone not all that inspired by Indian food. My bestie doesn't like Indian food which is sad since it's my comfort food but she loved this chicken!! Anyways if you haven't checked them out I highly encourage you to try it :)  Happy Yelping!!"}
{"text":"This place is bizzare. I was really interested in what \"upscale Indian food\" would taste like, and left with a mixed bag of impressions. The location in an old house threw me off, but they have done pretty well with the decor inside. We were seated by the windows in the converted \"sunroom,\" which was nice. Our waiter was attentive, the wine list was fine, etc. The food is okay, I would prefer an authentic dive-y Indian place any day though. Plus food here is REALLY expensive. I don't know, I just don't think Indian food was really meant for upscale formal dining. I guess if you live in Charlotte you have to go once to try it. Obviously I am not too enthusiastic though!"}
{"text":"Been to Copper a bunch of times, tikka masala a solid favorite, so are the other traditionals, fusion dishes a bit hit or miss, wife had lamb dish this time which was great. I'd rate 4.5 stars if i could"}
{"text":"Service left a lot to be desired.  It took 20 mins before the server take our order.  The aroma of the food is pungent as you open the 2nd door.    We had the mixed green salad, samosas, kebabs, garlic naan, raitka, & chicken masala from the main menu.  We were slightly disappointed that there were items on the Queen's Feast menu which were not on their standard menu.  The standard menu itself is very limited.  Samosa was okay. Filled with potatoes & a couple of veggies very little spice or sauce for those that edge on the side of caution with Indian food.  Pretty bland by itself - there was sauce on the plate that one could try.  Lamb kebabs - little spicier, flavorful like what you might get at a Greek restaurant.  Very little to distinguish itself here.  Dipped in the raitka added a bit of flavor.  Chicken masala - my friend was not impressed & felt that Indian buffets he has been to in the past were just as good.  Overall, the prices seemed high for what you actually get, the food is flavorful, the ambience is good, the service definitely could use some help, & the front stairs for females with heels is a lawsuit waiting to happen with the carpet that is coming up that could be tripped on."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an intimate and cozy date night in a cute house on East Boulevard, you'll want Copper on your list.   It's a dimly lit setting filled with tables throughout 4 main rooms and the 5th area is the bar (w/ tv). It is noisy due to the acoustics, so sit close or be prepared to up-the-ante and increase your volume. There's only one bathroom for each gender, but again, you're in a house.   Architecture and ambiance aside, the food is delicious. I'm still kind of a newbie to the Indian cuisine, so I can't remember any of the names of the entrees. The rice is good, the cheese/pea in a tomato type sauce was my favorite dish! We also ordered a coconut curry dish with vegetables...very coco-nutty. Garlic naan was good and the three dips (yummy) they brought to the table were made fresh (yogurt, tomato-something, and a mint puree). The samosas were a tad crunchy, but had a nice spicy punch inside. For you beer drinkers, the beer selection seemed a bit limited: King Pin, Budweiser, Bud Light, & Heineken.   The service was good and our server was helpful in suggesting flavorful dishes.   Caution: you'll spend a pretty penny or hundred for a night out here...easy. Too bad it isn't priced to be more of a regular stop. Like others have mentioned, it is a tad overpriced. I'll have to curb my cravings to once in a loooong while."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a few of my friends after just getting back into town. We showed up around 8 and were placed in the front room facing the street. First off, it was extremely hot in this room. My guests and I were sweating during our entire meal. It definitely put a damper on the evening. We looked at both the regular menu and the restaurant week, we all opted to go with the regular menu. We started out with the gunpowder prawns, good but nothing special. When the food arrived at the table I noticed my order was incorrect. I apologized and let her know it wasn't what I ordered (chicken tikka masala) and she apologized and took the order back. Around ten minutes later our server brought the same dish over (sesame chicken) and told me that's what I had ordered, I'm sorry but no, as a server myself I know that's something you never do. One of my friends doesn't like spicy and he told her that the sauce on her dish is already made and that it wasn't that spicy. Now I love spicy food and told him I wanted mine spicy. Her dish was way spicier than mine. Honestly I enjoyed myself and probably will return if I'm in the area again. Hopefully it won't be as hot next time!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night: samosas, tikka masala, and garlic naan. Samosas were a great app, nice and crispy. The sauce on the tikka masala was good, but definitely not the best I've ever had. Garlic naan was pretty good. All in all, everything was tasting pretty good until... I bit into the chicken. It was the toughest piece of meat I've ever had. How does that happen with chicken that's drenched in sauce? It didn't even taste like chicken - it was inedible and made me feel sick when I tried to chew it. It honestly ruined the entire meal. My fianc√© tried the other pieces- all disgusting. Won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Last time we came, many moons back, we did not make reservations and the staff was not very happy. So this time my husband and I made reservations to dine here for our wedding anniversary. Total flip in attitude. Note: Always make reservations! Our server was pleasant and patient as we drooled over the menu over and over again trying to narrow down our choices. For starters we shared the Masala-Chili Cauliflower Florets and Potli Samosa. Tastes exactly how the menu described, \"Zesty\" and \"Savory\". For our main meal my husband ordered the Roasted Seabass and I went with Cod \"Anjeeri\". Hubby's dish was perfectly spiced and portioned. The Cod Anjeeri was as well. The coconut sauce could've used a little bit more salt but I still inhaled the dish. It was comforting with every bite. For dessert we decided to go with the sampler, Hedonism. It was completely OKAY. If you're pressed for time or budget skip the dessert and go elsewhere. Great place to treat yourself, will come back again. They also do carry-out, good to keep in mind for one of those take out nights."}
{"text":"Great Indian food,  great atmosphere and great service. I also appreciated the waiter being very receptive and helpful when we were picking out dishes knowing we'd never had Indian before."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: might have given four stars if the service had been better.  My beau and I went to Copper on a Friday night to recreate our second date (from four years ago). We made a reservation for 7:30 and arrived right on time. We were seated promptly and then completely left alone for 8 minutes. I know, because I checked my watch.   The dining room was busy, but not slammed, however there seemed to only be two waitstaff for the entire business on a weekend night. Seems ludicrous.  We ordered samosas, saag paneer, their lamb curry and garlic naan. The food came out in a timely manner and tasted really good. I had asked for no cilantro garnish, but there was a significant dusting of cilantro on everything we received. No biggie, I picked it off and stuffed myself full.   Now that we are done with our food we waited nearly 15 minutes for a waitress to come around so that we could get our check and go.  I am not slamming the staff, as they were curteous and prompt when they were around, I am admonishing the management. It makes no sense to fill your restaurant to 90% capacity and have barebones staff. Copper is not an inexpensive establishment, and with the prices that are posted, diners expect to have not just tasty food, but a full food experience. That is simply not possible when you aren't properly staffed."}
{"text":"Copper is a fancy Indian restaurant with a modern touch. You will not find all your typical North Indian dishes here. I have been here twice and have found the portion sizes to be bigger, although it is on the pricer end, but nothing too extreme. I would definately recommend anyone to go here for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner and he loved it so much! The staff is so friendly - Jimmy was SO nice. They surprised us and brought us a little cake for Williams birthday. Lamb dishes were spicy but delicious. \"To die for\" my boyfriend says... 10/10 I would come here again...bringing my mom in a few weeks. Our new favorite restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  I went here years ago when I used to live in Charlotte, and again today as I'm back in town visiting family.  The food is INCREDIBLE and extremely authentic.  The atmosphere is very elegant however the prices are great.  You get great food, exceptional service, very upscale and quiet atmosphere and pay not even half of what you might expect."}
{"text":"Most recent Indian restaurants make  my local auto repair shop look swanky. Not Copper! The interior is very nicely decorated  with enough attention to furniture, cutlery, and painting etc.  Unfortunately, they had little time left to focus on the food. The quality is slightly above average. However, the prices are almost twice the average."}
{"text":"Great Indian, unhelpful staff.  Sat at bar, enjoyed lamb tikka masala with delicious naan and rice. I was practically drinking my tikka masala sauce afterward. One thing -- only three or four pieces of lamb! Taste made up for it, thankfully.  Green turf stairs and decor inside felt cheap for such cool building and great food.  Left my wallet and went to pick it up between lunch and dinner shifts the next day as a courtesy. They wouldn't let me in to get it! Loosen up."}
{"text":"The food was great.  The service was friendly and prompt.  I would highly recommend the chicken tikka masala as it's the best I've had."}
{"text":"Really great spot! Short review is that we got great service, food was fantastic and delicious. The chicken Mirch malai was amazing, will be dreaming about this!"}
{"text":"Decor, location and service to look for. Food was not exceptional for the price. Owner was very generous to offer us complementary dessert."}
{"text":"Copper is always a bit of a hit or miss with me. Which kinda sucks for me since I am not a huge fan of Indian food in the first place so I don't go here often even though it is in walking distance from the workplace.  The modernness of the interior is pretty cool, they sure managed to squeeze a ton of tables into a tight space! I would actually recommend this place for lunch over dinner. You get a nice soup or salad and much more reasonable prices for your money. The menu selection is also mostly the same during lunch as dinner so you won't be missing out on much. Make sure you get a certificate from restaurant.com before you go here, it'll save you quite a lot.  The first time I went here was for dinner, and good thing I made reservations because this place was crowded up with at least an hour or so wait! The single slice of complimentary naan is not enough for most people so we ordered a serving of garlic naan, and boy was it good! Paired with this was a variety of chutneys that were very tasty. I especially liked the mint chutney. For my entree I had some sort of lamb curry which I did not each much of because I thought the lamb was fairly tough and the curry was really just too strong to eat by itself. My date kindly shared his chicken tikki masala with me which was much easier on my palate and easier to chew. The second time I was here for lunch with fellow yelper Adam R. and this time I just went for the chicken tikki masala to be safe, while my dining partner decided to be ambitious and got some sort of peppery lamb curry. It looked very hot so I didn't touch it for fear of having to run to the bathroom on a quest for water. One thing I miss about lunch here is instead of naan and chutney they give just give you soup or salad. The salad looked decent enough, but being the curious cat that I am I opted for soup. Well this soup I think could've been used for pizza sauce and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. I just spread some on my naan and ate it like that.  Our waiter was perfectly decent and kept water glasses refilled the majority of the time for both visits, and duriing lunch it is pretty empty and we got to sit in the nice sun room instead of crammed into a corner at dinner. Seeing as this is about the only Indian cuisine available close to me and they have nice discounts quite often I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really tasty food, great ambience.but really high price. We had 5 teas and 3 samosas, 3 cauliflower, one keema batura and we were $100+"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food in town.  This place is great but it isn't cheap, you can have lunch for under $10 (comes with soup or salad), but dinner will cost $13-20.  Everything I've had here is fabulous, but the chicken tikka masala is not to be missed.  The lamb with peppers and onions and the mixed vegetables with mango cream sauce are also great.  Don't miss out on the soups, which are all great appetizers,a nd be sure to order some garlic naan."}
{"text":"I love Copper. The food is really good.  It's set in a historic home in Charlotte.  Love the atmosphere and the food.  The service is very warm and friendly, but a little slow.   Try the lamb kabab it is unbelievablly yummy and the potato with spinach dumplings (can't remember its name).  The Chai tea is a must. They use star anise and it tastes sooooo good!  Be prepared for the bill too.  3 courses and drinks will set you back at least $50.  :)M"}
{"text":"i LOVE Copper....easily one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I also used them to cater my partners' birthday party, and it was amazing. I still get comments from guests of the party how great it was."}
{"text":"Copper is one of my favorites!!!  Today for lunch I had one of my favorite Soups:  Roasted Red Pepper!!!  The first time I dined at Copper around 2006 I had this soup and enjoy it on many dines, it is very flavorful, creamy fantastic!  They do not have it every day for lunch, though they used to have it every night for dinner.  This soup inspired my \"Soup's ON\" list - It is that Wonderful!!!  The Entree is the one I usually get (more than half of the time) Chicken Tikka Masala: Chicken Breast cut into chunks and downed in a creamy Curry (I'm guessing a coconut cream/ tomato base with many spices) You can order it Spicy hot if you want, though they are sometimes hesitant to get it real spicy!  Basmati Rice and Naan Bread finish this entree well!  How about some Dessert or is everyone ready to go home?  You can not leave yet!  Take some of that Naan home and get ready for:  Sweet, Creamy, Tart, Rich, Complex, colder and coldest, Kulfi!!!  First is Kulfi Neapolitan (a pyramid of Kulfi's) Top layer is Pistachio, 2nd layer Mango and bottom layer is Vanilla.  Next three Desserts are Bailey's Kulfi, Pistachio Gelato and Lemon Sorbet!  The service was Superboy on Indian, which is a great compliment and the best way to say it!  Chicken Tikka Masala is a \"Gateway Curry, so.... You know!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food. It's a bit cramped though.  Good for groups but if you go as a couple you get seats that is in a cramped space"}
{"text":"Bottom line - we have chosen Copper twice, both times for birthdays, and both times we were absolutely glad we did! The food is WAY above typical Indian cuisine...the menu features traditional options as well as some very unique and well-considered new twists. Our biggest challenge is to try and choose from such a well-executed menu.   We have played it safe with one dish - Tikka Masala, both times, and both times it was the best we've ever had. Period. Recently went with a new twist, a black sesame apricot chili glazed chicken  - top notch...very tender white meat perfectly grilled and glazed. A fantastic new option! Of course the naan and rice were all up to expectations. Wine list could be a bit broader and California-oriented but our choices paired well.  Dessert was a carrot \"pudding\" along with an indian ice cream and star anise syrup. I really went out on a limb on this one but was VERY happy I did. The carrot pudding was served as two small egg roll style tubes, fried on the outside for a nice crunch and a soft, warm carrot filling. The ice cream was not spicy or out there...almost maple in it's flavor and nicely paired with the carrot. Glaze had almost no tace of licorice flavor but instead was sweet and could have been more present...great!!  The service was good both times. The ambiance is very upscale...great for dates and special occasions.  Highly recommended...we will not hesitate for a moment to refer friends and go back more often! We love Copper!"}
{"text":"There is a common thread between three of the best Indian restaurants I have ever dined in: Mel Oza. While I don't know the nuance and level of involvement, Consulting Chef Mel Oza has once again struck gold.  Our experience at Copper in Charlotte, North Carolina was nothing short of delicious from start to finish. The decor and ambiance of this refurbished home creates a great, personalized dining experience. Walking in the front door, just like you would any family home you will turn left or right into what must have been living rooms and dining rooms in this large home. White table cloths, modern white dishware, crystal clear wine glasses, and smooth silver utensils adorn the tables.  The food. The food. The food. This is the way I imagine upscale Indian food should taste. I also imagine that the items on their \"Authentic\" portion of the menu are quite close to the good-ole home-style meal that natives would expect.  This meal started with an order of samosas packaged in \"moneybag\" form. Crisp and lightly fried outer casings with mildly spicy vegetable filling. The presentation was immaculate for an appetizer - two portions balanced with what appeared to be wafer-style crispy beets over a delicious dipping sauce reminiscent of a Thai-style salad dressing with more kick.  For my entree I ordered the Chicken Chettinadu curry. Served with a medium-level of heat by the Chef, it was the perfect amount of warmth for a meal on a moderately cold day. The curry had just the right balance between smoothness and chunkiness, highlighting the juicy morsels of chicken included. Ordering plain naan and garlic naan went perfectly to sop of every last drop.  Not expecting the meal to get any better - \"The Three Excuses\" dessert took my meal to a whole new level. These three samples live up to their name - flourless\" callibaut\" chocolate torte, gulab jamun, balieys kulifi.  First - baileys kulfi: Indian ice-cream, a creamier and more dense variety of frozen dessert,  infused with baileys liquor - yes. Second - gulab jamun: how can you go wrong by making the most moist, delicious, and warm donut hole and covering it in rich syrup?! Third - molten lava cake.  Three cheers (Azitra, Copper, Lehja) Mel Oza and the team at Copper. I can't wait to go back.  Note:  The reason for 4 stars is due to the fact that our server mixed up our to-go containers - yuck! - which was not discovered until it was too late. They also added gratuity to our party of 7, a poor choice, as we all likely would have tipped well over 20%! Next time - I expect a 5 star experience out of this location."}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to trying \"modern\" Indian food for quite a while and we're disappointed by food that was only pretty good yet quite pricey.   The scallop appetizer was delicious and cooked perfectly with a delicious and slightly spicy sauce, it was the highlight of the meal and I would order them again. The lamb meatballs were dry and the sauce wasn't bad but described by my fianc√© as \"meh\" so nothing too exciting. We shared the apricot tikka chicken and the portion was quite small, the chicken lacked sauce and the veggies tasted like they were simply saut√©ed in some butter. Overall, this place wasn't worth the high price tag when there are so many other great restaurants around. Maybe the less expensive lunch menu would be more worthwhile."}
{"text":"I was honestly very disappointed with this place. I expected a lot more, esp because they had such a nice website and interior :P  My bf and I came here for restaurant week (RW), and upon entering the restaurant around 6pm or so on a Saturday, it was already busy, which is always a good sign. We were greeted by a hostess and lead to a table. It was really dark inside! But the interior was very cute, very romantic and intimate. I liked that. And it was inside a house, which is super cute. I would've given it two stars, but I really liked the interior and the food was decent.   I ordered: -Tamarind-Curry Leaf Prawns: These little guys were tasty! I really loved the sweetness of the chutney and the contrast with the tamarind. It was a little confusing at first, because I'm used to eating tamarind in Vietnamese dishes, and it's used a little differently, but I thought the flavors paired well overall.  -Seafood \"MelJol\": I thought the scallops in this were a little undercooked. The dish also got boring pretty quickly. They gave me like four or five scallops, which is generous of them, but the flavors were not something that stood out to me. But, overall, a good dish.  -Chocolate cake: This was their \"house\" chocolate cake. It was kind of dry... And also not as chocolatey as I would've liked.  I honestly don't remember what my bf ordered, and nothing on the RW's website menu strikes a chord, so hopefully what I did review is enough!  Also, our waiter was pretty terrible. He seemed really young and inexperience. My bf was asking about the Indian dessert option they had on the menu (I believe it was halwa?), and instead of explaining what the dessert was, our waiter just kept repeating, \"It's like halwa. It's like.. um, halwa.\" My bf started asking about ingredients (\"Is it the flour-y... or nutty...?\"), but our waiter kept responding in a non-helpful manner.   Lastly, their RW menu says, at the very bottom, \"$30/person including tax and tip.\" Clearly, that cannot/was not true. False advertising."}
{"text":"Food wasn't terrible, the ambiance was OK yet I'm oddly pissed after eating dinner this evening at Copper.  Pros  - Hmm...well my meal was serviceable.  Nothing to rave about.  But it was tasty.  I got the chicken tikka.  As did one of my dinning companions.  Our other girlfriend got the lamb.  Her review was similar.  Not bad, but not raving from the rooftops at how good it was.  I also give them props for automatically splitting the apps.  That's nice,  can you tell I'm digging for positives.     The Cons -  There's more of them and they are more concrete. 1.  The service.  The hostess was very little help when I came in asking for my party.  She seemed clueless.  Now in fairness I guess she didn't seat them, but you'd think she'd know who was where based on the fact that it wasn't busy and it's not a huge place.  Our waiter - he was meh, and very slow.  I honestly can't tell you if they offer free refills as I was never offered a top off or refill of my diet coke!  It took forever to take our orders.  Also he was very little help when asked about the menu.  I'm sure he was knowledgeable,  but he didn't appear to give a eff quite honestly.  2.  The portion size.  For the price I expect a lot more.  For a table of three we were given one plate of rice to share.  Now all of our meals were swimming in broth.  Oh hell no, you need to keep that slightly crisp (was is supposed to be that way?) rice coming.   3.  One dining mate got a side of vegetables  -  which turns out was $7 bucks.  I repeat $7 bucks. 4.  Yes Charlotte is in the midst of a record heat wave, but no excuse for being so damn hot.  Copper turn the A/C on high!  Overall I won't be back and I don't get why people rave about this place.  I think there's better Indian that doesn't stink of 'try too hard' in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. It has some of the best Indian food I have ever had. The servers are very helpful and knowledgable of the food, so they can help you decide. They have an extensive wine menu and I highly recommend the Hazy Mumbai for a cocktail. The art is very selective and each room has a wonderful different theme. The best room is the front room with all the windows because you get a great view of East Blvd and Paper Skyscraper.   I also highly recommend that you make reservations ahead of time, it will help you, trust me. This is also a good place for anniversaries, intimate birthdays, and anything that requires a fancy dinner celebration."}
{"text":"What little food you get is very good. But, they charge a small fortune. Don't expect to fill up here. If you're fat (like me) - avoid this place entirely or else plan to go eat somewhere else right after."}
{"text":"I was very impressed. I consider myself a foodie and have a penchant for spicy food so I ordered the chicken vindaloo. It was excellent; very flavorful and spicy.  We also ordered the cauliflower appetizer that was in a sweet slightly spicy sauce which we also enjoyed. I will go again and get exactly the same thing."}
{"text":"Keep your pupils dilated when you are driving to this location, else you may miss this restaurant. Your initial thoughts may be why are they so poorly lit and on second thoughts, you may even wonder if they are open. They have limited parking, so on busy days/peak hours you might want to get there early.  Its surprising they got more tables than the parking lot.  The person at the reception was all dressed up making us look under-dressed for the occasion. We came here without a reservation and it seemed like you would need to reserve before you come here. But anyway we got a table without much wait. That too for a group of five. The menu was a quick one page which was satisfying to read through.  We got ourselves some different curries and the waiting took quite some time. The service was alright and mediocre. The food came in fresh and hot. Even though the food had all flavors, it didn't deliver the punch we crave for from an Indian food. Not to be a fault finder, but the food quantity was moderate for an Indian restaurant. If you don't agree, check out their 4$ naan!  Summing up, the entrees on the menu looked very innovative and inspired from different regions of India. The menu was on the pricier side where a dinner for two might cost you 50$ or more. Definitely in the $$$ range. My pet peeve will always be with the restaurant's lighting. Extremely dimly lit interiors and well dressed receptionist gave me chills and reminded me of a cult house from horror movies. Copper definitely goes under one of those weird unconventional dinning experiences."}
{"text":"We've been fans of their Nouvelle Indian since we first visited Charlotte - circa 06 I think - but the results this time were extremely uneven, from excellent to really poor in fact.   I made reservations for Sunday night on Queens Week. When we arrived the customers there were finishing dinner and leaving ... at 7 pm !! Life in the big city! In fact only 3 more couples showed up that night, in spite of that the help did seem rushed for some reason.   But we weren't rushed: I ordered a bottle of Sula Chenin Blanc from India -which gets my endorphins flowing because I always associate it with dinner at Copper :)  For starters we had the chicken w/star anise, chili and a poori cracker (yes) it was a absolutely delicious with the right amount of heat. The same could be said about the tiny, tiny Chutney prawn appetizer, did I mention it was tiny?  For main plates we chose  Crab & prawn with figs, coconut milk and mango. It tasted Burmese rather than Indian but who cares? Excellent! However the other dish was well done chunks of leg of lamb with a very flat tasting sauce and a couple of slices of squash on the side. Boring as hell, in fact I heard another patron comment to his date that he was sure \"there must be flavor in his lamb dish ... somewhere\".  I should have sent it back, but I didn't want to spoil my companion's dinner.   Bread or Nam was not included, I ordered a la carte \"mushroom and green peas kulcha\" - think vegetarian pie- delicious, a roti and a side of very unusual vegetable bhaji, this one seemed to be a smoke flavored  Chinese stir fry (?).  The choice of deserts was an insult, a slap in the face!  Generic Vanilla or Chocolate sponge cakes, that's it !!  And they tasted no better than it sounded the sort of cake I'd expect from Starbucks, not from a restaurant.  Although to tell the truth is I wouldn't care about the deserts if only the lamb hadn't been so disappointing."}
{"text":"I love this place and I miss the food here since I have moved out of Charlotte. The ambience is really nice, gives you a nice cozy feel and very elegant decor. It's great for a date night or a group of friends. The food is really good and the butter chicken and naan are a must. The peppercorn chicken with the samosa pots are a homer in as well. Ohh I miss this place so much and wish you the best of luck"}
{"text":"I moved away from Charlotte two years ago and I really liked the city, but Copper is the single thing I miss most about Charlotte. The food is amazing and the service is excellent. It is legitimately my favorite restaurant anywhere. Get the Chicken Tikka Masala made spicy with garlic naan, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"After reading all the wonderful reviews on yelp, I decided to go on a date night to Copper. I had high hopes based on reviews but they were soon shattered! The place being so popular didn't meet my expectations food wise specially. In my opinion the food isn't  geared towards the indian palate. Chicken tikka masala and daal were so runny and tasteless. Naan was okay, service was okay. Drinks were tiny and overpriced. Overall, expensive food that didn't have much to offer"}
{"text":"So, we stumbled on Copper our first couple of weeks in Charlotte via restaurant week. I know restaurant week isn't always indicative of what the restaurant is usually like, but we were very impressed.   Service - the service was great. Our waiter was attentive and helpful, always making sure we had drinks, water and silverware when ours needed replacing. The decor is also fun, dark and romantic with local paintings and a quiet atmosphere.  The food we had was delicious. We both started with a chilled soup, which was amazing. If it isn't on their regular menu, they should consider adding it. It was more savory than other chilled soups I've had, but the flavors mixed well. It took all I had not to lick the bowl.  I had a duck and mushroom korma with lemon almond rice. It was spiced well, and decadent. It was definitely very rich though, and although the portions are appropriately size, I still took half my meal home. My boyfriend had the salmon, which was well cooked and seasoned with a delicious tangy sauce on the side. The presentation of both dishes was beautiful and portion sizes were great.   The desserts we had were just OK, although I'm not sure we go to an indian restaurant for delectable desserts anyways.   We'll definitely be back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Forgive the dramatics, but Copper is my favorite Indian restaurant...in the world!  And check out my other reviews, I  eat a lot of Indian.  The saddest part is that I no longer live in Charlotte but eat there whenever I visit.  Favorite dishes includes shrimp vindaloo, chicken tikka masala and lamb ghost.  Great ambience in a Victorian cottage and the service is consistently friendly.  Their menu has changed a bit but they will special order if you ask.  Copper is a rare treat in a town that could use more high quality ethnic cuisine."}
{"text":"Prior to Copper I had only experienced great Indian cuisine in New York and London. Copper is a crowd pleaser with both traditional and modern menu selections using fresh ingredients and great preparation. Many of the modern menu items take a simple preparation approach that are appealing to those not interested in many of the traditional sauces typically associated with Indian dishes.   Tikka Malala and whatever the fresh fish of the day is are my two favorites. And do not overlook their soup selection. Always delicious.   Situated in a historic Dilworth home this local gem has a consistent waitstaff that offer relaxed, yet attentive service, always with a smile.   If you love Indian or have always been intimidated by it you'll love Copper. Go now and make it part of your regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Copper delivered on providing an absolutely stellar evening of dining. My bestie and I decided to indulge in some higher-end Indian food on a recent Saturday. We made reservations for dinner at 7:00 and when we arrived, we were able to choose our seating area. We went with sitting at a table in the front porch area. However, they also provide patio dining.  It was slightly busy when we arrived but got busier as the night progressed. We decided to start our meal off with cocktails, I forget the actual name of the cocktail but it had mango puree, lime juice and amaranth (I believe that's how it's spelled?). It was delicious! and we also had the vegetable samosa. Th samosa had a slightly thicker crust than I was expecting but filled with the right amount of spice and texture.  My bff went the traditional route and ordered the chicken tikka masala while I decided to go the more 'modern' route and ordered the black sesame-apricot-chili glazed chicken tikka. A giant bowl of jasmine rice and basket of naan accompanied our plates. The naan was light, fluffy and practically melted in my mouth. My plate of chicken tikka was so beautifully plated and tasted even better than it looked. So juicy and full of flavor. The vegetables were lightly spiced and slightly al dente.  I got to try some of the traditional chicken tikka and the chicken was so buttery. The naan was perfect for scooping up the chicken and sauce. Our meal was delicious, we didn't want it to end so we ordered dessert. We shared a bowl of the kulfi which was delightfully light and sweet way to end our time at Copper.  If you're looking to impress someone special, celebrate a special occasion, or savor a good meal, go to Copper. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good Indian fusion. Nice atmosphere and well staffed. I only give it 3 stars because the portions, while delicious, with copious amounts of sauce, skimp on the vegetable and//or protein-- not a good value for money. Doesn't have to be inexpensive, but I didn't feel like 4 small vegetable 'meat'balls in sauce was worth $18, for example."}
{"text":"While flying into Charlotte the person on the plane next to me asked where I was staying. When I told him downtown Charlotte he highly suggested I try Copper if I liked Indian food.  I mentioned this place to several other people that live in the area and they all said this place is great!  They were right. I actually was stuck in my hotel room working and ordered online and had it delivered to my room. When the driver arrived he thanked me for ordering as his car now  smelled great!   It was delicious. Highly recommend if in the area! Can't speak about the restaurant or service as I had it delivered but the food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've had in a long time. No lunch buffet-excellent fresh food. I had the vegetable Tikka Masala and it was so delicious! I highly recommend you check this place out when in Charlotte. Great wine list too."}
{"text":"Great Food! Server was jut okay, not very personable. The food made up for it however."}
{"text":"Decent food in a cool atmosphere.  Service was somewhere between unacceptable and horrible.  Expect much better based on the location, place was empty by 10pm on a Sat night."}
{"text":"It was our first time here, and my first time experiencing Indian cuisine, and while I liked most of the food, it seemed a little overpriced for the what we were served for restaurant week.  We came for a friend's birthday party, and the hostess gave us the regular menu so we were a little confused when we sat down, but our waiter clarified we were given the wrong menu for Restaurant Week.  The waiter was attentive and pleasant, and patient with our questions.    We each got one first course, one main course and one dessert.  We were told for this special, we do not receive complimentary Naan.  However, they brought us some at the start of the meal and we were told it was on the house.  I loved my Corn-Asparagus- Black Beans \"Tikki-Chole\" which was quite plentiful.  However, most of the other first courses were pretty small.  Maybe this is what Indian meals are like.  The main courses were good, although I found my two large Scallops on the chewy side, but the sauce and salmon were delicious!  I heard the restaurant is very good for vegetarians, and we were surprised to see the only main course available for vegetarians was the Kachoril Waali Dal & Mushroom Medley Rolls, and our vegetarian guest of honor did not care for mushrooms at all.  This made it a bit uncomfortable for us having to ask the waiter if we could substitute a regular menu item.  Fortunately they did, but not until after the waiter informed us that he doubted they would do anything special since we all had to order off this menu.  Really??    We all agreed the dessert offered, the Mocha Kulfi - spiced cherry syrup, candied fennel dust, was horrible!  It tasted like stale, hard, corn bread with a hint of Pine-Sol cleaner.    While the food was good (but not worth even the special $30 a meal/$15 a plate), the ambiance pleasant, the company top notch, I don't think I would go out of my way to return here, especially when the prices would be even higher.  I would like to try a more casual Indian dining experience though and get a wider variety of options and sizes."}
{"text":"Traditional Indian food, in a very modern setting.  Absolutely loved the drink menu. Very chic names, great food presentation.  While the flavors are not truly authentic, It is a breath of fresh air to note that they do not serve cream and fat laden stuff, that their meats are actually fresh and they try and keep the flavors as near to the original as possible.   I disagree with people who say that its pricey. The quality of the food deserves the price they charge.   The reason why it is not a 5 star rating from me :   Service.   While it was not bad, it was not great either. The food took a while to come, the water would not arrive when expected etc etc.. you get the drift!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, really special drink menu (probably won't find it anywhere else!). We had the prawn appetizer, chicken masala, and my usual saag paneer. Staff is super friendly, and super helpful. I actually spilled my drink and they actually offer me another one! Can ask for much more from a restaurant."}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING. So good I wanted to lick the bowl. Not your typical Indian food. Def a must try in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I went to Copper last Friday for lunch using a gift certificate.  I was pleased with the food and the service.  The down side I have is the additional gratuity listed after the first gratuity has been added.  Overall I would eat their again and recommend it.  I think next I need a corporate credit line for all the food I wanted to sample.  :)"}
{"text":"We had a lovely meal at Copper. The setting was very cozy - food is served in at least 4 different rooms of a turn of the century home on East Blvd. we started with prawns as an appetizer - it was tasty, but I wish we'd been served 4 prawns instead of 3 -it's awkward for 2 people to share.  I ordered the Murgh Tikka Masala, which was delicious; my partner enjoyed the vegetable curry, which was scrumptious! The curry sauce, made from  coconut milk, was thick, creamy, and perfectly spiced. I tried the garlic naan, as another reviewer suggested, and it was tasty.  Other reviewers complained about the service but our experience was excellent.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Copper is a fantastic Charlotte dining experience! The ambiance of the restaurant's old house & Indian art make for lovely environment. The waitstaff is attentive & friendly. And - the food - is outstanding. My husband and I like to get three vegetarian entrees (large selection) & split them. We eat our hearts out & have plenty to take home for lunch the next day. We like to get a bottle of wine (decent selection of well-priced reds & whites). This is a great date night destination!"}
{"text":"Copper is located in a historical home in Dilworth. They have magnificently turned this old home into a very stylish restaurant without losing charm.  We started with a cocktail and a glass of wine, respectively. The cocktails were interesting Indian-inspired takes on classics. The wine list was impressive.  We started with two appetizers, having heard that they were fairly petite portions. The samosas abs cauliflower were both wonderful. Just enough to whet our appetites.  For entrees we were unsure of portion size, so chose to order a side of break with it (we didn't get the usual naan, but another bread with pickled veggies on top - the name is escaping me) - this was a good choice! The entrees are very easy to share (get one per person). They come with a side of rice and are very filling!  Service was great and food was even better! Will return again. Wish we had more Indian restaurant options in Charlotte, but Copper is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Need to get back here.What a nice experience. The food was fantastic,the service was great and set in this cool old house on East blvd sets up for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"I've been converted to a Copper devotee. For me, lunch is the key! Excellent service, great meal options! The lunch menu consists of more the basics that I am looking for when I am craving Indian. A soup or salad, a lot of beautiful rice, and a big bowl of meat or veggies (or both) in your favorite sauce. Always bustling at lunch and the food always comes out promptly - and with a smile. My absolute favorite lunch spot in the QC! I apologize for not updating my review sooner."}
{"text":"Top 10 restaurant in the world. (I have been to every continent and every major country) being from Chicago I also know what good looks like. This place is awesome! Go here"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Server forgot to bring my appetizer and soup. Food was not authentic and low quality. Very overprice and noisy inside. Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"2nd Best Indian restaurant in the Charlotte area (only after its sister restaurant in Ballantyne (Blue Taj).  Can be crowded and quite pricey but overall an amazing choice."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  The chicken tikka was out of this world - best I've ever had!  The simosas were also top notch.  My friend ordered the scallop dish - which oddly came with every vegetable imaginable (asparagus, tomatoes, onions, peppers, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, beans, + more!) and although it was different that's not necessarily a bad thing.  The ambiance was very... Romantic (soft lighting with tea lights at each table).  Will def'ly return here when I visit Charlotte  next. Some may say it is too pricey, but believe me, it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Copper is very cool.  It's an old house that has been converted into a restaurant.  The servers are probably not the most friendly, but they keep your drinks filled.  The Tikka Masala (probably spelled wrong) is delicious."}
{"text":"great food, great service. The price was a little high, but you get a lot of food. My wife and I would split a meal here and both be pleasantly satisfied."}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the nice bartender, and the hostess was nice.  Visiting from out of town.  The rest-- well, hum... 2 food items were good- the Cauliflower was really good- The Dhal was good.  They don't have a tandoori oven, so their breads are not authentic tasting.  I tasted flour in a couple, but a couple definitely tasted like freezer naan from Trader Joes.  I doubt their chutneys were home made- definitely the sweet one tasted out of a jar.  Service was weird.  They were not packed.  While the server was friendly- he never checked with us, he never offered anything.    Prob not go back here."}
{"text":"I have experienced Indian food before, and this place definitely ranks high in my list. The food, service, and restaurant interior were all fantastic. Went with a friend who worked in uptown Charlotte, who recommended this place. Chicken tandoori and the other entree (forget the name of it at the moment) as well as the bread were all super-tasty."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte!  The lunch menu is a GREAT value and they have the best Masala chai I've had outside of India."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  Copper is a modern Indian restaurant located in South End / Dilworth area of Charlotte, NC.  My manager picked this restaurant for dinner - and as usual, he was spot on with restaurant selections.  The restaurant itself is actually a house (Mayer House - turn of the century bungalow).  I ordered the Duck Leg Khorma (with anise-fennel masala, garam masala scented mushrooms, herb oil, thyme).    I forgot what my manager and coworker ordered, but I tried some and both were delicious.  Flavors are authentic but not too strong to scare off our colleague (it was his first time having Indian food).  He was still talking about the meal 2 weeks later.  Woot Woot!!    ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Met a friend in Charlotte for lunch here, and it did not disappoint.  Copper is in a historic bungalow in the Dilworth neighborhood.  Extra bonus, this is a great area to walk off lunch while viewing the craftsman style homes in the area.  Not the typical Indian lunch buffet, in fact this wasn't even offered.  Just fresh dishes spiced perfectly without being over the top.    Copper has traditional Indian favorites, creative appetizers, great naan (try the garlic), and a section on their menu for modern Indian cuisine.  We started with the masala chili cauliflower.  Excellent with the toasted spices, sauce, and some ginger.  My friend opted for anise chili-roasted cod with Goan curry.  I had the Goan curry with scallops.  The only reason I am not giving this five stars is my dish was short on scallops for the price, but there was no shortage of flavor.  The chai and friendly, attentive service were bonuses.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Copper is a solid Indian resturant.  The place is fairly small and seating is tight.  I agree with another reviewer who said it is a bit dark inside - it really is.  The staff are friendly and service is usually pretty good.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is very good and the naan is excellent.  The place is fairly expensive for what you get.  Overall a solid inidan restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian Cuisine!!  The best in Charlotte (tied with Sangram in Cornelius)"}
{"text":"Ash was our server and helped us plan the perfect dinner. Our friend from Dallas, Texas was in town and she was so impressed! Service excellent, food outstanding, fresh, flavorful and presentation suburb! The decor is beautiful and the environment lovely! My husband and I have this as one of our top 5 restaurants in the Charlotte area. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"I found Copper to be style over substance: Beautiful decor, fanciful plating, and superior service. The food, however, overpriced, under-portioned, and lack some of the classics of Indian cuisine.  I love Indian food because it can offer some of the most delicious guiltless meat-free meal options (which carnivores like myself often appreciate), which is why I was shocked at the overwhelmingly meat-based entrees here. My old favorites like palak paneer or malai kofta were replaced by seabass or duck-confit. I was so thrown off that I actually checked to make sure that I indeed entered the correct restaurant. It is nice to see modern interpretations of Indian food, but I was not prepared to drop $20+ on unfamiliar dishes using ingredients that I have never seen in Indian restaurants before. Perhaps they should consider expanding the more 'traditional' menu items.   I ended up getting the samosas, garlic naan, and tikki masala (as I do not eat seafood, which eliminates a chunk of the menu). The portions made be feel like a child again, due to their size. I left hungry and still craving Indian food, and a little cheated. I was even more perplexed at how I paid nearly $30 for the pleasure of that experience. I do not see Copper in my future."}
{"text":"Keeping it short. I like Copper. I like Indian food. Copper's food is like a fancier, less spicy version of Indian food. I have avoided this place for a long time because of that. Nonetheless, it's tasty. The atmosphere is nice. It looked like they were understaffed this time. Everyone was rushing around. I like Woodlands better and it is vegetarian. ;)"}
{"text":"Been were multiple time and the food is always very good.  The Samosas are top notch.  I usually get the Lamb curry which is always a good choice."}
{"text":"Worst Place. Misplaced our order and gave us a chicken dish instead of a veggie dish. We are prohibited by religion from eating meat. When we informed them about it, the waiter acted very rudely and tried to laugh it off.   We asked the waiter to pack the remaining food, he jokingly asked if we wanted the chicken to be packed too! We said we absolutely didn't wanted it . But, we later found out that he had packed it and put it in our bag! (What shamelessness)  When we talked to the manager, he removed the dish from our order and told us we won't have to pay for it (which was quite obvious). We asked for some additional discount as it had forced us to break our religion's rule. They denied it and said that we talk to the senior manager (who wasn't present there).  Their attitude in the whole incident was of arrogance and indecency. We will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but the food pales in comparison to it's sister restaurant Blue Taj IMO.  That said, they have a much better ambiance than Blue Taj."}
{"text":"I love Copper's lunch. Even though it's a bit of a trek from South Park, my coworkers and I will come every few weeks because it's that good. Lunch specials are very reasonable (around $10) and if you're in the curry variety, your meal will come with salad/soup, curry, rice, and naan. The portion is large enough that I can usually have enough for another meal. The servers are nice enough to pack away the curry, extra rice, and extra naan in a paper sack. It's pretty much the best.  I don't really like paying a premium for frou frou atmosphere, so I try to avoid Copper for dinner unless it's for a special occasion. This would be a great place for a first date with a more cultural spin though!"}
{"text":"I visited this place on a friends recommendation. We arrived on time, they have bookings available through open table. They seated us. The decor inside is nice. our table was not best as it was slanting in one direction. They have wine and cocktails, but I was told by server they donot have regular single malts and other drinks etc. Food was good I will give it probably 4 star. Service was slightly slow. Overall a decent experience. I would def recommend trying Kheema Bhatura in the appetizers section."}
{"text":"Overpriced and overhyped for lack luster mediocre and poor service.   I've been to Copper on two occasions.  Having lived in major cities in the US, I'm still trying to to adjust to the consistently higher ratings for sub-par places in Charlotte. It seems to take very little from a Charlotte restaurant to get 5/5 star ratings...but I digress. Copper is undoubtedly a perfect example.   Service matters.  Our server was no where to be found most of our meal on an uncrowded night.  Our wine glasses were empty for quite a long time prior to food arriving...we tracked him down...but barely got him to stop for a moment and ask for another glass.  He returned, left the full glasses, and didn't touch the empty ones.  I picked them up myself and put the empty glasses on the bar.  He also had unmeaningful answers when we asked for recommendations off the menu when ordering.   Food was flavorless and under seasoned, which I didn't now was possible with indian. Naan, rice, and both entries were unexciting...and the meat overcooked and dry.  The server didn't bother to ask how the meal was or check in.  He knew the service and food was poor that night.  For $90, it was not money well spent.  For a $45 meal in a \"fast-food-pace\" in and out indian place, it would have been fine."}
{"text":"I went to Copper during Queens Feast with two friends and we all agreed that the overall three course meal was not worth $30. My main dish was a \"Ghost Rubbed Chili Chicken\" and it lived up to its name because it was so small I almost didn't see it. The naan and sauce trio was my favorite part if I had a favorite. My friends ordered croquettes and they were semi-delicious. As the final course the menu offered a choice of chocolate cake (strange), or a traditional \"trail mix\" type cake. Our table ordered both but the chocolate cake was entirely too rich, and trumped the other courses in size. I'd rather fill up on the main course, not the dessert.   Other items of note: Our waiter was extremely nice, the kind of nice that is creepy--he was very interested in how each of our days had gone. But he was knowledgeable about the food. During the middle of the \"feast\" we were greeted by the most apathetic bus boy I've ever met. He told us blatantly \"I gotta get outa here man, I hate working here!\" We LOLed, but wow, who says that? Especially to customers eating your food? Really weird.   At least the building was nice."}
{"text":"The details:  We had dinner entrees for 4 w/ 2 appetizers, and garlic naan.  The building was nice and the atmosphere a bit dark (I need to see the food), but OK.  It's rare to encounter an upscale Indian restaurant and we were excited to go.  Reservations made via OpenTable.  Food quality:  The food was pretty fresh (wonderful veg) and tasty.   Complements to the kitchen staff.  Price: Entrees were $3-4 too expensive for the quantity / locaton / overall experience (especially the service).  Had the service been polished and we had been made to feel special, it might have been OK.  Service:  The waiters weren't rude, but it didn't seem like they were professionally trained or managed.  It seemed to be a bunch of guys who had eaten at restaurants much of their lives and said \"Hey... I can do that.  You just ask what they want and bring food to the table.  How hard can it be?\"  and then they got sick of not being tipped well (because the answer is:  It's hard!) and they just stopped trying or they haven't figured out that their service is poor.  No greeting at the front door.  No waiter introduction.  Menus were distributed quickly and then the staff left.  No specials... no explanation... no question/answer.  Just \"What do you want?\"  Dishes were cleared quickly, but one at a time and at odd times, interrupting the conversation.  Really... it just wasn't polished enough to warrant the price.  Especially with the white tablecloth and environment, the service really tarnished the experience.  We weren't special at all... just another table to turn.  Overall:  We enjoyed our dinner, but it's not going to draw us back.  I'd rather get good Indian take-out from Jaipur down South Blvd and take it home.  Honestly, if you are going to charge me 4-star prices, you need to deliver a 4-star experience and not just 4 star food."}
{"text":"As an Indian, I would be lying to you if I said that Copper exemplifies traditional Indian cuisine. If I may be so bold, I would conclude that Copper's unique and cultural references make it a hot spot for the best fusion-style Indian cooking that I've been to in awhile.   To give you some context, the way we eat Indian food back home is with our HANDS, fingers covered in butter chicken gravy, and pieces of chana masala stuck in between our teeth - all washed down by homemade raita and mango lassi. Never will you see Murgh Tikka or  Sheekh Kebab presented to you on contemporary bowls and platters the way it's done here. At these prices, I could probably buy a goat or three in India given current market conditions.   From a taste standpoint, the flavors are certainly all there. They MUST have an Indian in the kitchen.... right next to a mixologist throwing masalas everywhere. \"I know! How about Tandoori-spiced-cherry glazed duck confit in a soy-mushroom-black cumin broth with a parsnip-kale fricasse?!\" (actual menu item) Dude, you just mixed 10 different nationalities together! Stick to your day job!   Even so, from what I tasted, everything was surprisingly delicious and the complexities of each dish were visible and apparent from the outset all the way to the last bite. I also enjoyed the fact that there was portion control in a country with a struggling waist line, which allowed us to try numerous dishes and not feel overwhelmed.   All in all, good food, good atmosphere, but don't expect your \"curry\" to be the kind you get in Mumbai or Delhi :P  4/5"}
{"text":"So being one that has never tried real Indian food I was dying to try this place.  Hearing all the rant and raving about it I was pretty certain it would be great.....and IT WAS!  Single family home turned restaurant this place is very quaint and quite a nice romantic spot if given the right table placement.  My girlfriend and I got  a perfect window spot so I considered myself lucky :).  The service was great and very friendly too.  We got an order of bread to begin with that came out with a sampler of dipping sauces, one was mint based, the other two more like a ranch and then a more spicy concoction.  I wasn't a big fan of the mint.  For the main entree I tried the Murgh Tikka Masala.  It's chunks of chicken served in a quasi spicy tomato based sauce.  Served along with a side of rice it's the perfect combination of flavor and heartiness in a meal.  I ate it all with not a morsel to spare!    Also, just a note, I would have given this place a 5 star rating but there was one minor drawback.  The dining room area seemed to be pretty warm.  I don't like breaking a sweat while eating and especially if the food is warm already.  Maybe there were having a/c issues?  In short, that won't be enough to keep me from coming back.  Also, not sure if it's still out there but there is a certificate on www.restaurant.com for this place ($25 off $35 purchase), use one of the 80% promo codes for the certificate and that's a big 'ol WIN!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch around 1:30. The place was not too busy. Food was fantastic. Service not so much; waiter was quite inattentive and in general we did a lot of sitting around waiting."}
{"text":"The food and the service were both exceptional. The lamb Marsala was wonderful so was the vindaloo but get ready to sweat as with any good authentic Indian dish (:  we eat at the sister restaurant. \"Blue Taj\"  quiet often and love the ambiance there , we like the private feel there. Little more but still a great restaurant for Authentic Indian fo"}
{"text":"Copper is a really great place to go if you are fairly new to Indian flavors and you want something upscale.  The restaurant is in an old house and it's beautiful.  Their curries are sort of mild and creamy, so spice lovers or serious Indian food aficionados may be a little disappointed, but they are well made and good quality.  High points of the meal were the samosa appetizer and the paneer kulcha (naan-like bread stuffed with cheese and saffron).  They also have an excellent wine list including some VERY pricey stuff -- it's easy to blow a bundle here.  But if you've got someone to impress Copper is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Amazing food as always. We walked in on Saturday night and didn't have any reservations. But the mgr still accommodated us and gave us a table with out a wait. Excellent service. Must Try if haven't already."}
{"text":"First time here with 2 of my close friends. Made reservations and was seated immediately. They have the biggest wine selection I've ever  had. Ordered the saag! It was delicious. I forgot to ask for extra spicy and the waiter didn't ask spice level Either :(  very small space but I loved it. Atmosphere felt like dinner at a friends house! The only con is staff is smaller. It was only 3 waiter working in my area. I wait 20 minutes each time for a glass of wine on 2 different time."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went here with my boyfriend for dinner one night and it is all around fantastic. The setting is cute and eclectic and extremely romantic. The foo d is very flavorful and the whole experience generally was top notch. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"OK Yelp, how in the world do I rate a restaurant where the food is excellent yet the service is poor? Last week,  I met friends for lunch and the wait was painful (at lunchtime.) Later arrivals were served before our table. Basically, the service was slow and a bit \"cold.\" I have been to Copper many times and the service seems to always be an issue. I absolutely love their Chicken Tikka Masala (yeah, I know - not authentic Indian) but a REALLY love their version of it - served with that beautiful Basmati rice and naan that floats up out of the basket. That's why I go to Copper but the service is getting to me....."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food in Clt. It's not as authentic as Woodlands off of independence but it's so good! The servers can tell by your selection how spicy to make the food and the wine selection is great although pricey. Get creative and order something you've never heard of, odds are you'll remember it after eating at Copper.   Side note; my gps had it as Cooper not Copper in case you're wondering why you can't find it."}
{"text":"Menu was unique and different.  Prices seemed just a tad high for most of the fare.  Food quality was above average.  My only dig is the value."}
{"text":"Copper is located in an old house in Dilworth, but once you step inside, it feels like you've been transported to a much bigger city.  Maybe it's the low, red lighting, but it reminded me of NYC.  I haven't tried everything on the menu, but these are my tried and true picks:  Lamb meatballs, masala-chili cauliflower, goan prawn curry with shrimp.  Incredible."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I wish I could eat here every day. I've been here a few times and just have not had a bad meal.  My fiance came to Copper Tuesday night for a pre-Valentine's dinner. Service was excellent! People were constantly checking on us and having conversations with us about their food. I felt very welcomed there!  We started with the masala-chili cauliflower as an appetizer. My lovely fiance let me eat most of them since they were amazing!! I don't think I've ever had a more delicious cauliflower dish. They were lightly fried and covered in a sweet and spicy sauce. Yum!  My fiance had the seafood medley and I had the lamb kozhambu. I typically stay away from lamb, but I thought I'd try something different. When it came out it had an odd smell that I didn't find too appealing, but one bite and I was sold! It was tasty and spicy and the lamb just fell apart. The basmati rice it came with was cooked perfectly as well. The seafood medley was also amazing. It was a sweet and creamy dish and my fiance almost licked the bowl! And the garlic naan on the side was just perfect....fluffy and crispy in places and covered in yummy garlic. We were way too full to try any desserts, but they all looked delicious as well. I took my leftovers home and I think they even gave me a container of fresh rice with my meal. Perfect! I wish I could get takeout from them every week."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's pricey for Indian food but think of it more as high end Indian.  Normally eat at bar where Simone is amazing    She is  great and remembers everything."}
{"text":"I didn't realize how big a fan I was. I crave this food with naan and curry chicken and then the delicious sampling we had. The rice paired perfectly to the spicy sauce. I've been several times since!"}
{"text":"I don't tend to give restaurants bad reviews but this time I had no option.  Here is a little background on a recent experience we had at Copper.  A cousin of mine graduated from college this past weekend and we decided to go to Copper's sister restaurant Blue Taj for dinner.  I have had food from Blue Taj before and the type of food they serve was perfect for the group of people that were going to dinner.  When we called to make reservations we spoke to the owner who said they had no room available for our large party but Copper his other restaurant Copper could accommodate us.  He said the restaurants were the same and said he would make a reservation for us there.  We agreed and thought nothing of it.  I have heard from a few people regarding Copper and they had said the food was good there so I decided to do no further research.  After graduation we arrived at the restaurant and within minutes I realized this might not have been a good idea.  The concept of Copper is not the same as Blue Taj.  Anyone would tell that from the menu and the ambiance.  Considering we had a large number of vegetarians with us the menu was lacking on those options.  We had already sat down and ordered drinks so there was no other option for us.  The portions at Copper are small and not worth the price they were charging.  The type of India restaurant I was expecting was one where we could all share different dishes but that definitely is not the way Copper is set up.  The food here is what you would call modern Indian food and not traditional.  That was why it was really hard for me to find dishes for my family who are used to the traditional dishes that are served at most Indian restaurants.  The one dish that was VERY well executed was the Lamb Meatballs.  It was cooked perfectly and the sauce it was served in was delicious.  On the opposite in the chicken appetizer and the shrimp appetizer were horrible.  The chicken was extremely bland and and not well executed.  As far as the shrimp is concerned if I'm paying almost $15.00 for a dish I expect more then 4 SMALL pieces of shrimp with no flavor.  The dinner portions were bigger but should not carry an average price tag of $20 a dish.  If this restaurant was well executed I know I would enjoy it.  I enjoy new age Indian food and don't mind splurging ever now and then but it has to be worth it.  This place was not.  And the fact that we were told it was the same as Blue Taj was a huge blunder on management's part  This is not a place you should take everyone for a large family dinner.  This is a place for smaller groups and corporate dining.  The service and ambiance is nice but again because of the food and confusion I can't give it more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"An American/Modern take on Indian, this place has decent food that you'll spend a lot to try. Service and atmosphere were both good. There are many other places in Charlotte that I'd rather spend that kind of money."}
{"text":"Worst place ever walked in at 2:24 and guy says we are closed. When online it says open till 10:30 pm drove 30mins to eat here."}
{"text":"Copper is EASILY the best Indian restaurant in town, and it's not even close. In fact, it's some of the best Indian food I've ever had.   You'd never know looking at the place from the street that housed inside is an incredible Indian spot. Copper is basically in a classic house on the side of East--it looks like a wealthy family would live inside. This makes for an interesting inside-of-the-establishment: you're basically sitting in a converted dining room, living room, library, etc. There's a bar there, and it looks like it's where the den used to be. Again, though, this is a nice old building, not some crappy shack. I'm  not doing it justice. The bar isn't a great scene, though: kinda small, not too crowded. Just so-so. Go for the food.   It's amazing. The samosas are particularly great, and we always order the Chicken Tikka Masala, which we order spicy (always). The menu's split into authentic (old school) Indian and modern/fusion Indian. Stick with the former; the modern stuff just isn't as good. It doesn't feel like Indian, really.   The staff is great and the service is great. It can get a little pricy, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I can not remember ever having Indian food before, and was taken to Copper on a first date.  Not only was the date impressive but so was the restaurant.    Seated in a beautiful glassed in room over looking the street, the service was wonderful, and the food even better.  There is a delicious Roasted Red Pepper soup that is FABULOUS.  It is not on the menu every day, and my date had gone the night before to ask if they could make it for us, and they did!  (You can see why both the date and restaurant impressed me, :D )  Since I have never had Indian food (that i recall) I let my date take the lead and order for us, and he did wonderful!  He ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, which is chicken breast in a creamy curry (maybe tomato/coconut as well) sauce, served over rice.  If i could have licked my plate and still looked like a lady i so would have done it!  lol  He also ordered lamb over rice which was also very tasty.    For desert you MUST try the Kulfi.  The best way to describe Kulfi is to say it is similar to an Ice Cream type desert, but more dense.  It has a wonderful, yet different flavor, due to the addition of cardamom.  Copper offers several flavors, and we tried quit a few of them, and ALL of them were delicious.  Defiantly a 5 star experience all around, atmosphere (very romantic), wait staff did a wonderful job, food was fantastic, and their presentation is BEAUTIFUL (makes you almost a little sad to dig in and mess it up)!!  Can't wait to go back!  And as for the date, he's mine now, sorry ladies! lol."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Staff so friendly and polite. Super attentive! The place is cozy and well decorated. The food delicious! I have to admit that it was my second time having Indian Food, but I did like everything we had.  Hubby and I shared the cauliflower appetizer, and then had the lamb and the duck. Both of them were amazing!! For dessert we had the kulfi and the three excuses.  Go for the Kulfi, you will not regret it!! We enjoyed our visit, we will recommend to friends and definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of Copper. I also love that I can use Restaurant.com coupons here too. When I first came here, I thought I was going to somebody's house, haha. I usually get the Chicken Chettinadu for my entree. I love they give us Naan, but it's usually not enough for me, so I end up ordering a Garlic Naan on top of that. Overall, a pretty good spot. I know they're making the most of the square footage in \"somebodys house\", but some of the seating arrangements are a tad bit too close to other peoples' personal space. Either way, I'm still a fan and will continue to stop on in, assuming I have coupons, haha."}
{"text":"Good cocktails, had a Sahma that was fruity and fairly strong! Our waiter was attentive and they were pretty busy! Very pretty inside, soothing, the tables are pretty tight so you hear everyone's convo (not loving that) food was delish! A cod dish and chicken dish, the names were so long I can't remember! It's pretty pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Just an update on service!  Shannon at the bar is very nice and we are happy she introduced herself us!    So nice for the manager to show us the bar when we came in for our resv as we didn't know they had one!    Sanjee was our wonderful server for the evening...one of the nicest and most personable since we started visiting here.  We've still only gotten the Tikka Masala but Sanjee let us know about their lunch offering specials to try other things and the buffet of more traditional Indian dishes at their sister restaurant in Ballantyne!  We are looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Okay, we Love Cooper. We visited when we loved in Dilworth. I'm a fan a few Indian restaurants, but Cooper is not your standard Indian fare. The ambiance of the restaurant is great, the food is great, and the cocktail options are good. Plus it's a family friendly environment, even though he lady and I went alone our last visit.   If you want a good to great experience, visit Cooper. If you like Indian food, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Lovely ambiance.  Service a little slow but it didn't matter because of the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food but small portions and expensive."}
{"text":"Love Copper!!! It's tucked away in a cute house on East Blvd. Each of the front rooms in the house provide different dining spaces, and offers a cozy atmosphere. The food is fantastic. We started with the Potli Samosas which is just enough for two people. My husband ordered the Tiki Masa chicken dish and I ordered the Spiced Vegetable Curry, and you must order Naan bread with your meal. The dishes were so delicious and flavorful, and enough that we had leftovers. Definitely suggest going here....it's definitely in my top ten 5 for Charlotte! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really loved the food but think its WAY overpriced.  Will be an occasional stop when Im craving indian -but Im from chicago and got the same delicious indian for half the price so its hard to stomach the prices.  Great Tikki masala and nann.  To Copper- lower your prices and you could have a real loyal following- but for most people you have priced yourself into being a very occasional visit."}
{"text":"After four years in Charlotte looking for good Indian food I think we found it. We came from New York City where the choices were endless and really good. Copper really lives up to expectations. Consistently delicious food, very friendly and helpful staff and an eclectic environment. Both take out and dining in have been great experiences. They have great lunch specials as well and are happy to adjust spicyness to your taste."}
{"text":"After pulling up to a quaint house repurposed to restaurant you enter into a dimly lit entry way with soft music playing in the background. The white table clothes and smartly dressed waiters definitely add to the romantic atmosphere. However the mood is dampened a bit by the small and rather close together tables. The menu is thoughtfully laid out starting with a good, but not overwhelming, selection of appetizers, traditional Indian dishes and modern Indian dishes. The samosas come beautifully plated with a hot sweet and sour chutney. The seared scallops are my personal favorite because they always come cooked tender on the inside with a distinctive seasoning seared on the top and bottom. I am still a novice when it comes to Indian food so my go to order is the chicken tikka masala and I love the creamy tomato sauce it comes in which they do not prepare with much heat. I have also tried the dahl makhni which was also a solid choice for those still experimenting with all the new flavors of Indian cuisine.  While Copper dishes have been consistently enjoyable I am not quite sold on the value of the meal. They offer a single slice of naan to begin the meal, but if you would like additional naan, even plain, they charge. That seems a little too opportunistic when they are already charging $20 for most of their meat dishes and $15 for vegetarian. At least they do include the rice in the meal price. Other people have noted that the wait staff can be a bit off-putting and we have experienced that before but our last two visits the waiters were very attentive and had a courteous and friendly demeanor. Hopefully this is a sign of a long term improvement. I would definitely recommend Copper with the caveat of understanding this is probably the most expensive Indian in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Posting this feed back after my 2nd visit to this restaurant. I was traveling for work from NYC and I am neither a family member nor a friend. Giving an honest review to help people looking for good food or restaurants.   This is one fine place for Indian , Pakistani food.  Some important info for those who are deciding if they should go to copper or not.  Food can be prepared  Mild to Hot upon request. ( My personal preference is mild and they catered the right spice level for me).   Staff is friendly and focus on customer requests.   They keep refilling the water so people don't have to keep looking for waiters as this is one common issue at other places.   Menu is not that big but I think very carefully selected for right food in different set of categories.   Ample parking.  They don't ignore,  stare at you  or do eavesdropping.   Liked the fact that the Manager (Jimmy) who also handle front desk gives visit to each table and inquire about special requests or if they can help with any things else when it comes to food and service. I call this a great service tactic.    Keep the good work going COPPER.   Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Delicious food but a little too dressy for a frequent occasion. When I eat Indian I like to do it family style.  I didn't feel comfortable with that here."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5  We started with some delicious naan and a variety of dips. The mint and mango? chutney were a highlight of the meal.  I had the Papdi / Mango / Watermelon Kachumber Salad which was refreshing but I wasn't sure that the onion seed dressing really suited the salad. I then had as my main dish the Allepy Masala Prawns  which were too heavily salted for my taste...but admittedly I am sensitive in this area. The prawns were served with probably the best part of my entire meal - the gigande beans pappu -Wow the sauce was deeeelicious. My dining partner had the croquette's and root veggie Wadas which were ok but not restaurant week worthy in my opinion. Finally we finished off our meal with Mocha Kulfi which is like a very sweet thick ice cream and a key lime pie. The key lime was excellent and I am not usually a fan.   When it comes to Indian I have a soft spot for masala so I would like to come back and try something more traditionally Indian.   Our service was absolutely great and the ambiance is fantastic. The outside area is really nice.Copper would make for an excellent first date."}
{"text":"From the outside, Copper seems to be one of those non-authentic, fusion type Indian restaurant. As such, I was really surprised to find some really good and VERY authentic dishes whipped up here.  They offer both fusion and traditional dishes. I tend to order the traditional items and I've never been disappointed. Some of their fusion type dishes are also pretty good actually.... and did I mention their cocktails? What a great complement to dinner.  My only gripe is service tends to be a bit slow here and they tend to ration their naan bread (sucks because we are usually there in a large group).... hmmm"}
{"text":"As nice is the location... Food not so much for an indian.. The food tasted very ketchupy... We ordered cripsy cauliflower and i expected a good amount... But was disappointed to see just 3. The taste was not spicy too."}
{"text":"The location of Copper is excellent - a converted house right on East Boulevard. The (enclosed) porch is a great place to watch life pass by while you gorge yourself on their tasty naan - standard or garlic are both tasty.  While the entrees do not come with naan, it appears that you get a small sampling for the table. Some of the servers, and there is a whole platoon of them, don't speak all that clearly, so I'm not entirely sure on this point. We were out with another couple and ordered a number of naans for the table, so that first one may have been the first of our orders, it could have been complimentary, or it may have been someone else's. Just something to keep in mind.  Unlike some other places - looking at you, Situl - you get plenty to eat here. For a couple, some naan, an appetizer and an entree will likely be plenty to eat, though it of course depends on how hungry you are.  Though the dishes are tasty, the amount of taste varies considerably depending on which you get. The appetizers (including the naan) were the star of the show. A garbanzo curry - ordered from the \"sides\" list, as an appetizer - and a lamb meatball were excellent. The lamb especially had a bit of a kick to it.  However, while the murgh tikka masala had a nice cream sauce to it and the chicken was tender, there just wasn't much flavor. It definitely needed another level or two added in, as it was just a bit so-so in comparison to the amaze-balls (see what I did there?) of the lamb. Nothing bad, just needed a bit more to match the appetizers."}
{"text":"Mmmm delicious! They have their own parking lot which is a plus! Restaurant itself looks like a old restored house. Staff was friendly and the restaurant was beautiful. I got the chicken tikka masala and it was delicious and creamy. I wish it was a little spicy though. Garlic naan was amazing. Lots of garlic and flavor and bread was very soft. One thing I liked about this place was they give you rice without asking! Some places you have to ask for rice and they charge you but this place did not! Rice was fluffy. One plus about this place was when we were done with our food the server got a comb and brushed all the crumbs off of our table. I've never seen that done at a Indian restaurant here. :)"}
{"text":"We were up for the day from Charleston, SC to shop.  Since we relocated to the South from DC, we've been desperate for good Indian food.  So trusting our fellow yelpers, we walked in to Copper without a reservation on a Saturday evening.  Our waiter was especially kind and friendly.  Upon ordering, we were promptly served complementary naan with a trio of sauces, mango chutney, raita, and our favorite, the mint chutney.  We loved the mint chutney so much we asked for seconds during our meal.  The tikka masala and lamb gohst were excellent.  And to my surprise, when we opened up our to-go bag to eat our leftovers the next day, they had not only included more complementary naan, but a ramekin of the mint chutney.  Not sure if this is a standard or if they did it just for us, but it really tipped the scale.  We think that Copper rivals famed DC Indian restaurant Rasika.  We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I felt that this place was overpriced for less than average Indian food. What sets this place apart the most is the absolutely horrible service. I tried it three times. I try to always do that if I feel that there might be something I miss on the first or second time at a restaurant. I kept hoping maybe it was a single server...then two...when it hit three separate poor servers, I was done. The food is merely okay for the price paid-the service ensures I won't return. Long waits at the door (with open tables visible), attitude and exceptionally long waits for orders placed are why I give it 1 star. In addition, it's like a cave inside."}
{"text":"Amazing! We love Cooper...it is our all time favorite restaurant! Every single time we come we have a wonderful experience... The atmosphere is inviting, the service suburb and the food consistently excellent! Once you have had Cooper... No other Indian food compares. The chicken tikka masala is heaven!!!"}
{"text":"As Todd. W mentioned, we finally got around to giving Copper a try. While I'm glad we finally made it to this upscale and cozy Indian restaurant, I'm not clamoring to go back there asap.   The Good: The interior is lovely and the service is efficient, helpful and kind. Our Garlic Naan was super tasty and I really enjoyed hearing our waiter Sunny explain the menu (traditional vs. modern fare). This ambiance definitely caters to date night! They also offer great attention to their wine - the first page of their wine list details that they will decant your choice prior to arrival, look for special bottles upon request etc. That's a fabulous touch.  The Meh: For what you get, the main courses are a bit overpriced, IMO. My scallop dish was interesting with bits of fried shallots, sauteed pears and potatoes. However, the scallops were a bit undercooked and I was overall slightly underwhelmed by the dish. I supposed I was expecting more flavor. Same with the samosas. The shell was a bit too crunchy and I was expecting more spice and pizazz with the filling.   I like you Copper, but I think we'll just be friends. I don't see a long term romantic relationship developing."}
{"text":"The Good -  Location, close to downtown and the only better Indian restaurants in the area.  Building, They've converted a colonial style bungalow into this restaurant. Nice looking from the outside but very dim lightning inside.  Parking, ample free parking available on the road and around the place.   The Bad - Food, pretty ordinary stuff, you'd get better Indian food if you can drive down around Matthews area. Only the mango lassi saved the day. Naan were hard and rice not well cooked.  Service, slower than the usual Indian restaurants.  Meal size, on one hand they're charging you premium prices but one entree is only good for one person, funny isn't it. This isn't an American or continental entree after all.   The Ugly -  Too many tables in such less space. I felt horribly claustrophobic inside especially with the lights being so dim. The noise levels inside were intolerable. HUGE LET DOWN FOR PAYING PREMIUM FINE DINING CHARGES AND FINDING SUCH A CRAMPED PLACE.   Verdict -  You're short of options when in downtown and lookin for Indian food so this is the only place to go, rest other restaurants in the area have pathetic feedback. Not that I'd advice you to not visit this place, but keep your expectations low and wallet full of cash."}
{"text":"I recently relocated to Charlotte and I was extremely worried that I wouldn't find a good Indian restaurant. Copper hit the spot. Although it does not compare to the Indian restaurants in Miami it offers flavorful food and great service."}
{"text":"Best in town! This place always blows me away, you definitely need to check it out. The tomato soup is to die for."}
{"text":"The historical house that houses the restaurant is nice and the food was fantastic. My friend ordered the chicken tikka masala which was some of the best i've tasted. And the dish i ordered -- the scallop dish (i forget the name) had so many vegetables in it that it was ridiculous (asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, beans, carrots, tomatoes, onions, green/red peppers...), but amazingly in spite of that it was delicious and well prepared.  The flavors were so appetizing, but not overwhelming. Looking at the prices initially i was apprehensive, but surprisingly, it was actually worth the cost."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed to write a heavy-on-the-negative-side review of this place. I was soooo looking forward to trying it out and having a wonderful experience but I ended up short. Our waiter was very attentive in the beginning but then he got distracted by a party of girls who either had too much to drink or were just normally extremely outgoing and forward with their conversation. In any case, they were chatting and chatting and chatting and stiiill chatting by the time we had finally set our menus down because we were tired of waiting to order. Their chat probably went on for a good 10-15 minutes in front of our table without our orders having been taken. I didn't worry about it too much but by the end, I was getting frustrated. I know our waiter was probably giving us time to review the menu, but it still seemed a little excessive. Once we ordered, our food did not take too long to arrive but it was definitely mediocre and did not give off a fresh taste. I asked for my food to be prepared spicy and that request was accommodated. We had a restaurant.com coupon and I gave it to our waiter prior to his preparation of our bill. I did not realize a certain percentage of tip was automatically included in the bill until I went to add the tip myself. It appears they automatically added 18%. Now, this is annoying to me. I know some people may not tip properly but I am a regular 20%+ tipper and while our service was not exactly stellar, I probably still would have left a very generous amount (on the full bill, not just the discounted price). Needless to say, I did not add any additional tip to our bill. Don't think I'll ever be going back to this place- not necessarily because the food or atmosphere is bad, but just because the food is not worth the money (you can get similar tasting food at a cheaper Indian buffet place) and the service wasn't the best. As I said, I am feeling very heavy with disappointment just writing this review and it's not even my business! I had high expectations and was super excited to finally try this place but it wasn't all I thought it would be."}
{"text":"If you like Indian food, then I highly recommend Copper!  It's a quaint restaurant in a old house that makes for a unique atmosphere.  Try one of their unique cocktails and you won't be disappointed!  Also, I highly recommend that if you go as a party of two - order one starter and one entre to split between the two of you and some naan - it will be more than enough food!  On that note - we order the prawns to start which were delicious. Only wish we had gotten more than 3.  Then we had the lamb kozhambu for our entre with both regular and garlic naan. So, so good!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Copper tonight for our anniversary. We just recently became vegetarian and have been looking for restaurants that offer  great plant-forward dishes. Copper was AMAZING. We've never tried Indian food before but wanted to try something different and this was the best decision we could've ever made! Great romantic location, warm ambiance, superb service, wonderful menu options, and above all delicious, refined exquisite food anybody would love!"}
{"text":"Best Indian I've ever had. Not saying too much as I have only been to a handful for Indian restaurants. But it was awesome, didn't stray too far from the traditional as I got the Chicken Masala, but best Masala I've ever tasted and my wife agreed.  A must have for a nice occasion, a little on the pricier side but def worth it."}
{"text":"This place has interesting interiors, felt comfortable with the whole vibe frankly. Food I really found was decent with kheema bhatura and goan curry passing the test. I say passing because having lived in western India my expectations were high (kheema is essentially mumbai dish and goan curry is well, found in goa). Deserts were just right. Overall whole dining experience was good but not extraordinary. Where it falls flat is VFM factor, you charge me bucks but give me bang for my bucks. 3 for now but will come back copper"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service and excellent ambiance. Whether you love Indian food or have less adventurous guests in your party copper has something for you. For the \"gourmond\" section of the menu has sauces on the plate like an upscale american or french style plating while there are also all the traditional Indian dishes. Love the mango mousse cake for dessert, samosas for appetizers, chicken tikka, also have had some of the vegetarian dishes. Loved everything we've had there so far. Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"After seeing all the positive reviews on yelp, i had huge expectations but the food wasn't satisfying. The tomato soup was too tangy and so the sabz paneer. It was almost un-edible. However the staff was kind enough to take it back and fix a little. If you are looking for traditional Indian food, this might not be the place.   The two stars is only for the service."}
{"text":"Definitely a foodie and this place is is my #1 fave restaurant in Charlotte. The dishes are great, the ambiance is intimate and everything was delicious. I'm a new fan to Indian food but it was very authentic. The naan was the perfect texture. GO HERE! It is ideal for an intimate date or a small group of friends."}
{"text":"Hooray for a terrific Charlotte Restaurant Week choice! Copper had been on my radar for awhile, so it seemed like an ideal time for me and my mister to check it out. I am not an expert of Indian food by any means, but I do appreciate good atmosphere, service, and menu options. Copper delivered on all accounts.   The restaurant is in an old house, and each room appeared to have a slightly different theme. Definitely perfect for a date night or a meal with visitors from out of town. We were seated in the red room, and were initially the only ones seated there. Our waiter joked that we wouldn't be alone for long, and he was right. It was definitely packed on a Saturday evening, so reservations would be wise. The service overall was a highlight of our experience, and will definitely bring us back. The waitstaff was very helpful in describing dishes and making recommendations, and our meal was well paced.  I won't go into much detail about the food because it was a specific menu for restaurant week, but I will say everything was delicious, the flavors complex, and at a perfect level of spice."}
{"text":"We are glad we ventured out of our comfort zone to try Copper. What a wonderful meal!  We are Indian food amateurs, so planned to dine during restaurant week. We ended up going with the full menu, which was a similar price.  I had the scallops for the start which were perfectly seared and prawns for the main. Both came with medium hot, delicious sauces. My husband had shotgun prawns for the appetizer, which weren't as hot as the name. He had lamb curry for his main and loved the sauce, but thought the lamb was slightly over cooked.  Ice cream and sorbet for desert. The perfect cool finish! We dined on the front porch. It's a great open room. Really wonderful atmosphere.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just ate here and was really good Indian. We liked this as its a little upscale and so the wine list was pretty good which you don't find in smaller India restaurants. We started with the simosas and were really good, the sauce was different but had a sweet spicy taste. I had the tikka Marsala which was really good. My husband had a lamb dish and his was great too, had almost a vindaloo taste. The four stars are due to the waiter, he was very slow and rarely checked back. It was almost 10 mins after we sat down before he came to get our drink order. After we started eating it was so long that I had to flag him down to get water as I had no drink. The second reason was my husband ordered his food as spicy as they could make it, I tasted it and was nothing near other restaurants. I would give it an American mild versus anything close to Indian hot. It was still great but not exactly what he asked for. Will probably give it another shot and hope the service is better."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. They even got us in for dinner with no wait at 7pm on a Saturday. So you ask why the 2 stars? We had a male Indian waiter, who took 20 minutes to come ask us what we wanted to drink. This is the only time we saw him. The busgirl and busboy brought us our drink refills and food. So when the meal was over my wife, who is Indian, asked the busgirl if the waiters split the tip with them since they (the table busser) do all the work. The girl said no. So my wife gave the busgirl a cash tip. My wife also decided not to tip the male Indian waiter since he basically did nothing. On the way home my wife checks her bank account and notices the male waiter added for himself a 20% tip. Needless to say we were pissed! We will NEVER, and I mean NEVER dine at this establishment again. Food is great, sketchy waiters."}
{"text":"Review update-5 stars!! After getting more experience with this type of cuisine & coming back here?!---I was amazed.  Let's start by saying there was a 45-1hr wait on a Tuesday night at 7 PM--I can SEE why.  I actually sat on the back patio & waited for a table.  It was well worth the wait.  The paneer tikka masala was out of this world delicious! I got about 5-6 spice level and it was perfect.  The garlic naan is the best I ever had.  I ordered two helpings!!!  Everything was hot and fresh.  The food came out quickly.  The service was good.  I will definitely be back soon... I can't stop thinking about it after comparing it to other places and after my last outstanding visit!"}
{"text":"Copper is an authentic, local restaurant I found while working in Charlotte. If you like Indian food, then this is a spot you should try."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy eating here. We had reservations for my birthday and I was so looking forward to a delicious lovely meal. We had reservations and were seated on the porch room. We had an unfortunate view of the air-conditioning units. Air conditioners that did not cool the area we were sitting in. We were so hot it ruined the whole experience. The people beside us were so loud and we were melting from the heat. The food was ok but not as good as it had been on previous visits. Service was good though. Won't eat here in the summer again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent food.  The mango chutney is so declious I could eat it by the spoonful."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience and presentation. Limited Indian menu but really versatile stuff . Very tasty food . Little expensive than others."}
{"text":"Hands-down, one of the best meals I've ever had in Charlotte (and I've lived here for 10 years). From the service to the ambiance, all the way to the last bite of our dessert, everything was exceptional. Copper is now at the top of my life for any occasion. I cannot wait to go back. (And, Great date night spot- even with the garlic Naan!)"}
{"text":"The saag paneer and tikka masala at this restaurant is top notch. I come here often for lunch. Personally I think this the best Indian restaurants in Charlotte. I look forward to my next visit here."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Tikka Masala. It was great, and a great deal. usually you pay about 14 for a plate with rice, but this was $11 for the entree, salad, and naan bread. I'll be back."}
{"text":"It started off bumpy but definitely got better by the main course.  Salad- Was not a fan of the dressing. It was sweet and almost tasted like mango lassi  Bell pepper Coconut Soup- too oily and sweet  Masala Cauliflower- good flavor but soggy   Chicken Vindaloo- very delicious and the level 3 spice is actually a level 4.   Saag Vegetable- good flavor and spice level  Paneer Tikka- great flavor, creamy and delicious    Would come back for the Vindaloo."}
{"text":"We just finished lunch here, had a very interesting appetizers... scallops and the prawns . Fantastic use of Indian spices in a nontraditional way. For The main course we had the lamb and the chicken both were cooked excellently and the lamb was especially tender. The saag paneer was was great also."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and I have been underwhelmed each time.  The food is good, but just doesn't stand out.  I love the concept of the restaurant, but the \"modern\" dishes need to still have more Indian flare, as this claims to be an Indian restaurant.  If you are really looking for Indian food, stick to the traditional meals or you will be disappointed.  The traditional meals are fine, but I also don't want to pay that much for something I could get much cheaper at Maharani or another great Indian restaurant in Charlotte.  The location is beautiful, but the service is lacking.  It is a small place and service should not be that difficult to get right.  The last time I went was with my wife, sister and brother-in-law.  The dishes were brought out at different times, given to the wrong people, etc.  After the appetizers were cleared, the \"busser\" took my used fork off my plate and put it back down on the tablecloth - kinda tacky for a seemingly nice restaurant.  Before our dinner, we sat at the bar.  My wife was pregnant and she ordered a mock-tail.  The bartender was great about making something up.  After making the first drink, she realized she had some mint and made another.  It was nice seeing a bartender go out of her way to make my wife feel like she is getting a special drink, even when she can't drink alcohol.  She did not charge us for the second drink, but she definitely got a great tip.  I am giving this 3 stars because I can't bring myself to giving it 4 stars, but is should be about a 3.5.  I do recommend trying this place, but do not expect an Indian focused dish if you order from the modern menu."}
{"text":"First time at Copper.  It was a nice find.  The food was very good and the atmosphere was nice.....we enjoyed the art.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.  The food was a bit more expensive than most Indian restaurants but the portions were larger.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is named very appropriately, since you feel you're about to start mining for copper when you walk in. I have never in my life been in a darker restaurant. The moment we were handed our menus I noticed everyone in our party squinting. If you choose to dim your halogens to such an extreme, you need to choose something other than a 9 point font for your menu. I have 20/20 vision and I found myself tilting my head around so my shadow wasn't blocking the menu. Just strange, almost claustrophobic.  This place touts itself as modern-Indian cuisine, and based on the presentation and preparation, it is very non-standard fare. The plating is elegant and and some of the food is quite good. The samosas were very tasty, however you get 2 small ones for $7. Saag Paneer, which is essentially creamed spinach and farmers cheese, goes for a whopping $15. That's way overpriced, in my opinion. I had the lamb traditional style for my entree and I have to say it was the blandest lamb ever. For Indian food, the spices were missing and the lamb was tough. It was also cut into strips like some kind of stroganoff, which was bizarre. The spicy chicken slivers were very delicious and 4  alarm spicy. This was quite a contrast to the lamb which was so flavourless.   All in all, it was an interesting experience, but the prices of their food were not justified by the quality or flavours. It just didn't work for me. I'll stick to the traditional mom & pop Indian restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's day and they had a pre-fixe menu. Service was awesome, my sweet tea never got to 1/3 full and I had a new on the table. The chicken tikka masala was rich and the meat super tender. The samosas were flavorful and the sorbet sampler was very tasty. It came highly recommended and it did not disappoint.  I have had pretty good Indian food in California and Copper was definitely comparable."}
{"text":"What a great find! I was a bit daunted at first when I saw the three $ signs on Yelp but I thought I'd try it out anyway.. and I'm glad I did!  My colleagues and I arrived around 8:15 pm. The weather was so great we decided to sit outside - consequently, I didn't really look around too much inside.. it looked pretty upscale and nice from what I saw though!. The host walked us out to a table and we got settled.  For appetizers, we ordered the cauliflower dish and the samosas. Both arrived fairly quickly and were really good. The cauliflower could have used a little less sauce though.. was bordering on overpowering.  That is where the gripes end! For our main courses, we ordered the Lamb Kozhambu, Lamb Chops and the Cod dish with Tandoori Rotis and rice. All three dishes were REALLY good. The lamb chops in particular were outstanding! I highly recommend you try them!  Since we were enjoying our meals so much, we decided to order dessert as well. I ordered the Gajar Halwa - Rabri combination dish (name escapes me). My colleagues god the Three Excuses and Hedonism. All three desserts were really really good and we polished it all off.  I think we have discovered a bi-weekly Indian restaurant in Charlotte and will be sure to return. You should check it out, and be sure to try the Lamb Chops!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed.  Here's a place that I used to frequent.  Strike 3 guys. Overcooked chicken, dried-out fish cooked in dirty oil, and everything else served cold.  Terrible service, and they refused a $25 restaurant.com #  on a $150 bill (insult to injury).  Here's the best part:  this was over 3 weeks ago.  I wrote them to give them a change to make up for it.  No response.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for dinner with a few of my co-workers.  I have few complaints, but before I list them, I would like to say that this place does have a decent tasting food.  So if that's your only concern, please disregard my ratings and do visit this place.  One of the biggest complaints I have is of their staff.  The manager who seated us was very professional however our server was very rude.  He didn't have any patience .   He was talking way too fast and he was picking up plates when we weren't even done.    When we ordered appetizers, he taunted us by asking, \"is that it?\" and when we actually got the appetizers we realized he could have told us that we have small portions for appetizers.    As he was picking up empty plates from our table he is spilling crumbs all over us and didn't have the decency to apologize."}
{"text":"Copper is an Indian restaurant located in a former home on East Blvd, as apparently all restaurants on East Blvd were constructed in this manner.  Recently I was in the mood for great Indian cuisine but did not have any desire to sit in a restaurant.  So, having heard mostly positive things about Copper, I made the decision to place an order for pick-up.  Food - I ordered the Khoya Malai Maans which consisted of chunks of lamb in a red curry sauce w/ whole toasted spices. This was accompanied with a pan of basmati rice.  I also ordered the Plain Naan (buttered) and the Saffron, Almond, Paneer Kulcha.  This along w/ a chicken curry dish for my g/f came out to be about $50, which I thought to be extremely expensive.  Maybe I have just been spoiled by the India Garden in Pittsburgh, PA (near the University of Pitt http://www.indiagarden.net/ ) that offers 50% dine-in dinners every night after 11 PM or maybe this was just freakin' expensive!!  Anyway, being that this was so pricey I expected to be blown away.  I was not.  While the g/f's chicken dish was tasty and well made, my dish consisted of diced lamb that was on the tough side.  The spices of the dish were great but tough lamb is something a good Indian restaurant should never have on your plate.  The naan was \"okay\" and the Kulcha was tasteless.  I was left pretty disappointed.  Service - Order was taken promptly over the phone and there were no errors w/ what I had ordered.  Overall - With this experience, I now cannot wait until Thanksgiving week to head over to the Oakland area of Pittsburgh, sit down, and order some very tasty Indian food.  I hope I do not get arrested while there because I now realize the place in Pittsburgh has a steal of a meal.  PS - I will provide a review of Indian Garden while there a month from now."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and I'm of Indian descent so I'm very particular about these \"modern\" Indian spots. We got the chicken tikka masala, chana for the side and a naan and it was JUST the perfect amount of food for 2 people to share. Loved it! And also very clean and nice on the insides"}
{"text":"First time at an Indian rest... and the food was wooonnnderful! Ambiance was nice, service was excellent. The Naan was out of this world good... the Tikka Masala yum... and the Chettinadu was terriffic (and i don't care for curry). Indian is not my first choice in food... but i would not hesitate for a moment to go back (or take others there)."}
{"text":"One word: YUM!  I had the Paneer Masala and Garlic Naan (Come on folks, tell me that garlic naan doesn't tug at your heart strings?).  I love Indian food so my latest visit with Copper was to introduce a girlfriend who had never tried it.  Service was, as always, amazing.  The food was wonderful, too!    I love this place.  It can be a bit pricey but is worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"I'm torn on this review. On one hand the food at Copper is amazing but in the other the service and the rest of the experience leave much to be desired. It's not a good place to go for lunch. Or lunch took 2.5 hours and they won't split the check if your party is too big. That's not a huge deal for a group of friends but for a team work lunch that is kind of a pain.   I got the Pundabi Tadka Masala this time with goat. It was very good, but I've gotten the Tikka Masala in the past and liked it a lot more. I also tried the Goan Curry that someone else got and liked it a lot more as well. My dish was spicier but had a lot less flavor than the other two. Most of the meals at lunch come with soup or salad as well as rice and naan. I got the bell pepper soup which was delicious.   I would come back again but I would have to be better prepared to spend half the day there."}
{"text":"The taste is not very authentic. I did try the chicken chukka and their shrimp curry. The ambience is nice. Give it a shot for an formal dinner or a date! But not to try authentic indian cuisine."}
{"text":"If you've not been, you'll do yourself a favor being here. A true modern and traditional cuisine fare from India. My preference is their classical dishes. The staff are amazing and will accommodate most requests. I like to add vindaloo for my naan! Otherwise all dishes are spectacular -- the meatball starter is a winner. The manager (maybe the  owner?really cares. Five stars."}
{"text":"Perfect ambience for date night. Quiet and enjoyable. Food was good in taste and quantity. Molten chocolate cake was good. Also the paneer Tikka masala was tasty. Enough amount of Jeera Rice served with it. Tomato soup was good in taste but little bit on buttery side and quantity felt lesser with because bowl they used to serve the soup was huge. Staff was friendly, parking was little difficult because being smaller parking lot."}
{"text":"If your looking for an Indian restaraunt....don't go to the Copper. If your looking for an Indian Fusion restaraunt...don't go here. HOWEVER, if your looking for an interesting American restaruant, then you can try this place. You may be dissapointed though....You'll notice that there are no \"indian\" people eating at this place...there's definately a reason why!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype.    I've eaten at Copper once before, maybe five years ago. I thought that it was mediocre and grossly overpriced, which is why I hadn't been back until last weekend even though its just a few blocks from my house.   Given the continually positive reviews, I decided to give it another try.  What a mistake.    I ordered a cocktail.  I don't know what the bartender had intended for this drink to be.  But it was simply horrible.  I think I could blindfold myself, reach into my liquor cabinet, dump booze and mixers into a shaker, and come up with something infinitely better.  On to the food....  We got the Crab Kundan Quorma.  Crab and curry sounded like a great combo, or at least it should have been. $27 dollars for a soupy and flavorless dish.  In no way was this dish appealing.  It was simply nasty.    The other dish that we ordered was the Punjabi Gosht.  The curry/sauce was quite nice.  But the meat was obviously of very low quality.  My jaw got a workout trying to saw my way through it.    The service was also mediocre at best.    The one thing this restaurant has going for it is the atmosphere in an old house.  That's it. Nothing more."}
{"text":"You pay for location and excellent service, but the food was average.   We got the Amritsari Garlic Chicken for an app.  I came out with 1 kebab chicken portion with a few carrots for garnish.  It was good, but for the price, I would have passed,not that good.  We were given 2 pieces of naan as an app with 3 dipping sauces. One yogurt, another lemongrass mixture, and the other an apricot spread. All good.  My husband got the Murgh Tikka Masala and I got the Chicken Chettinadu. Both were average. Nothing to go and tell mom about really. I asked the waiter to make it spicy, because I love my Indian food spicy as you can get it.  I was not impressed with the spiciness as the waiter promised. It was a good dish if you were not used to Indian food and give it a try, but not really authentic .   A few suggestions for the restaurant from a first time customer. TURN THE MUSIC DOWN!! I am not in a disco club and don't want to start throwing glow-sticks around the room. The music was way too loud and like house electronica and indian. Weird, not my cup of tea for wanting a relaxing meal. Also if you want some better curb appeal put some flowers in those flower pots as you walk in the building, the dead flowers that were probably there from last year can be replaced. And do something about those pillars that look like they had old wallpaper wrapped around them from many years ago.  Closing out. The tip was already included with your price. So be ready to pay the 15-30 percent of your total bill when you checkout. I don't remember seeing that on the menu (it may have been there, but didn't recall it.  Overall, 3 out of 5.   Wish had more of a selection instead of a 1 page menu, and the music selection. Service was excellent, but lack the authentic cuisine I expected from my money.  I highly recommend Passage to India in University if you want to get your grub on. They have been my favorite for many years because of the authenticity and the quality of food. When you see the culture flock to a restaurant like this you know its amazing. Go check them out."}
{"text":"Copper, what an experience. I have never been a huge Indian fan, but had heard great things about Copper & had to check it out. I made reservations and luckily I did because the restaurant was entirely full, with a variety of customers which impressed me. We arrived at 7 and were seated immediately. The restaurant is in an old renovated house so the tables are in different rooms which is quite unique. The ambience is nice, although a little dark. We started with the naan, prawns, and samosas. The naan, and three dippings sauces was so warm and fresh! The prawns, cooked too perfection, and re samosas, a veggis delight wrapped in a fried treat. Onto dishes, we chose the tikka Marsala and duck confit. Both were amazing! Unfortunately we were too full for dessert, but I look forward to getting back again soon."}
{"text":"Copper is the best Indian food in Charlotte. They are able to increase the spiciness depending on your preference. The service is excellent and the lunch special is a real deal!"}
{"text":"I have lunch here at least once a week, the staff knows me to the point of no longer needing a menu!!!  Very professional and awesome food, if you like Indian, give this place a try."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was awful. We came in for dinner on a Monday night when it was not completely full. Our server was very pushy to get our orders and then was so hard to track him down for water or dessert or the check. I would expect better service for this price range, hence three stars and not four despite the food.   For food, we had the modern chicken Tikka with black sesame and apricot glaze. The chicken was cooked perfectly - moist on the inside with the glaze beginning to caramelize on the outside. The veggie biryani was also good. For dessert we had the kulfi, which was a small portion and left me wanting more because it was so tasty. I would come back but maybe avoid the service and just take it to go next time."}
{"text":"Finally gave Copper a try and glad we did. I ordered the Goan shrimp dish and it was delicious. I love anything that is coconut based and spicy. The flavor I thought was outstanding. My husband ordered the chicken tikka masala and it didn't disappoint. We also had chai, samosas, and the chocolate lava cake with mango lassi ice cream- all very tasty. My husband and I spent a few months in India do we know good Indian food. For a Indian restaurant in the states it was pretty good. Last, the service was good and overall had a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"As an self-proclaimed Indian food connoisseur, I was very impressed with Copper.  I thought it was a good restaurant for folks who are new to Indian food and the staff was very helpful to my co-worker who was with me and had never tried it!    They did not have the standard Indian lunch buffet, but it was affordable, large portions and you got a salad and naan.  I personally like the variety of the buffet, but the environment of Copper made up for not have one. :)   I loved that the restaurant is in an old house, too.  There is a covered patio that was very nice to enjoy the view outside."}
{"text":"The food at Copper was quite tasty.  My dish, chicken in a sauce used for butter chicken, was fabulously delicious, except it was much tastier than butter chicken.  I have finally made the decision to purchase Jasmine rice.  Sam's sells a huge bag - I will have to learn to cook it properly first.  The atmosphere at lunch was typical, phone call here, phone call there.  However, the dish was delightful as was my company!"}
{"text":"Cool decor, I really didn't like what I ordered- but I would try again."}
{"text":"I've read the raving reviews and I would come here maybe once a week on average to pick up their chicken tikka masala and a cup of mango lassi. Very solid atmosphere - perfect date place - and I love how they have this restaurant in a house which seems like a more residential part of town. Very classy place in a cool house. However, the food quality, while good and definitely above average, isnt the best I had. I found the chicken tikka masala to be a bit bland and creamy compared to other Indian restaurant's I've been to.  Blue Taj by Ballantyne definitely destroys this restaurant in terms of food quality."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for lunch service   We dined at Cooper today for lunch, have been wanting to try since our takeout experience. We were quickly seated, though the parking lot and indoor seating were packed. We were seated in the extension in the front. A big plus not available in most Indian food places, ice water yay! I docked a star because the wait was ridiculously long for our order to come out, over 30 min! Not great if work is strict with you about your lunch break.   Finally, the food did come out. My favorite was the saag paneer $9, it was the most flavorful dish out of all our food. The spinach and paneer were plentiful. I'd get this again, but can't say the same for the other items. Dhal makhani side at $7, not worth it. Every expensive for the portion you get and it was not as flavorful as I had hoped. I've gotten better dhal makhani out of smaller less trendy places. The chicken tikka for $11, I don't think I would purchase for lunch again. I'd have to stick with takeout dinner on this... The gravy was abnormally very watery and had an underwhelming flavor compared to the takeout we previously ordered. I'm guessing they have a big pot of gravy premade and then add protein/veggies as needed. Which is totally fine if you can pull of flavor and consistency, neither or these were there today.   I'd come back for the saag paneer at lunch, everything else is probably go dinner service. Tho I recommend going with traditional dishes, the fusion dishes may leave you disappointed if you are already experienced with indian food."}
{"text":"The chicken Tikka masala traditional is so amazingly good. The chicken is white on the inside. The naan is most excellent, very fluffy. I also shazamed several songs, great tunes. I've never been disappointed by the food at Copper. Go and be glad. Ambience in the sun room is also warm and fun to dine around.  Warning: just went to pick up lunch takeout at 2:30 and when arrived was told they threw out the food. They literally called at 2:30 when I was driving and thirty seconds away. I didn't answer because I was about to arrive in a minute. Threw out the food.... annoying. Anyways just writing to warn people to get there before they close or definitely answer your phone :("}
{"text":"I love trying new things. Including ethnic food. We ended up at Copper because my mom was in town and we wanted to be adventurous. She lives in a small rural town where \"chinese\" is the only real ethnic option. Her question, \"Do they have things without curry? I don't like the spice.\"  So the Mr checked out the menu and found just the perfect thing for her: a dish with chicken in a tomatoey cream sauce. Let's just say that my mom was victorious. She ate it all. Unapologetically.  As for the Mr, he got something with lamb. I tried the sauce and was impressed.  I ordered something with spinach and fingerling potatoes. It was \"spicy,\" but my nose wasn't running 5 minutes in, so it wasn't THAT spicy. The flavors were just perfect.  We ordered the naan, and it's my favorite of all the Indian places I've tried. It's served with a few sauces - my favorite was the fruity one, followed by the herby green one. (Yes, I know, I could look up the names, but I can't even pronounce them!)  Notes:  Service was wonderful. We arrived on a Saturday night at 6:15 with a reservation, sat outside, and were treated tremendously, despite our lack of ordering alcohol. Our server was very kind, thoughtful, offered a recommendation when asked, and according to mom, smelled good. (Always a plus.)  I don't know why other people have complained about service, because ours was just so outstanding.  As we were leaving, the inside was starting to fill up, so reservations, especially on a weekend, are a good idea.  It was a very positive experience for us, and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Copper is a pleasant, 30-minute walk or quick rail ride from Uptown Charlotte, housed in a beautiful old property that's been wonderfully renovated inside. Indian EDM thumps incongruously from a mounted speaker, quite at odds with the relaxing environment.  There is a 'Coppertini' menu along with a fairly impressive wine list, with a few decent whites by the glass, including a light and refreshing Indian Chenin blanc, which is what I went with.  The menu promises not just the old Indian restaurant standbys but also some modern takes on the country's cuisine, including a tandoori-spiced duck leg confit (not cooked in the tandoor, of which none exists in this restaurant) and dhana dal with scallops.  'Masala Chili Cauliflower Florets: Zesty Soy-Tomato-Scallion Glaze, Toasted Spices, Ginger' ($9) sounded good. In reality what arrived was essentially a pretty poor plate of gobi Manchurian. I understand that the taste in Indian food is towards very crispy batters but this was something else, nowhere near pliable with a fork, and the glaze was reminiscent of over-salted ketchup more than any of the promised spices or zest. Some complimentary naan and completely extraneous chutneys arrived with this, the bread clearly out of a bag, as well as some raita.  For entree I chose 'Kashmiri Chili-Fennel Roasted Lamb Chops, Wild Mushroom Pulao, Lamb-Mushroom Redux' ($27) and was sorely disappointed. The lamb chops, which I requested medium, came rare, and needed knife and tooth to be prised from the bone. That would be excusable were it not for the nearly total lack of flavor. Some fennel came through, but the lamb-mushroom redux on top was simply overpowered by the burnt edges of the chops. The pulao was a bit better, having a genuine earthy hit to it, but not enough to rescue the lamb. With this dish came more of the naan and a vast bowl of basmati rice. Yes, rice to go with the pulao.  I was of no mind to try a dessert after that so that was the end of the meal. Service was professional, if quite reserved.  For just short of $50 this was a hugely disappointing experience. Frankly I am baffled at Copper's excellent reputation. It's a beautiful space and clearly a great deal of thought has gone into the menu, but the food is nowhere near good enough at any price point, much less the one charged."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving Indian food and read great reviews about Copper. After checking out their menu (which was current!), we made the jump. We drove for an hour to dine here tonight, and we more than just pleasantly surprised. We were floored!  Upon arriving, we were attracted the to quaint outside appearance. The vintage home the restaurant is built inside of is cute and homey but the d√©cor is colorful and modern. We were instantly greeted by the host who had our reservation ready and made welcoming chitchat to us about it being our first time. He also spent the time to tell us a little about Copper's concept, which helped us make our slection.  We shared the Gunpowder Prawns appetizer: the tart granny smith apple paired perfectly with the prawns in a surprising and unique way. My boyfriend stuck with his standby, Tikki Masala, which was complex and rich and a wonderful portion. I dined on Apricot Chicken Tikki, which was invitingly spicy and served with a robust selection of vegetables. We also shared an order of Garlic naan.   Everything was heavenly. We will definitely be back as soon as a craving for curry hits. Can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Copper is my favorite place to eat in Charlotte. Everything is delicious. The dessert with the pistassio dust on the ice cream is awesome."}
{"text":"All the wonderful reviews of this place are right on. The chicken tika masala is to die for. My spice tolerance is usually much higher than most so when asked how spicy, I responded, \"Korean spicy\". The meal came out just right for my taste. You are paying for the ambiance so be prepaid to pay twice as much as you would for a mom and pop Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"After all of the hubub surrounding Copper and the rave reviews from my friends, we finally decided to give Copper a try...and were sorely disappointed.   When we arrived at Copper, I was actually quite impressed with the interior of the house. It's well appointed and has a romantic atmosphere...you know, if you're into that sort of thing. We were seated quickly at a great table on the \"porch\" and the server even checked my coat for me. That's about where my positive comments will stop, so if you're a die hard Copper fan, you should probably stop reading.  It took about 5 minutes for us to get water, about 10 minutes after that to place our wine order, and approximately 10 more minutes for the wine to actually arrive. Fortunately, it was delicious, unfortunately, our server literally stood there and read the entire back of the wine bottle after pouring it for us...awkward, he then walked away from the table before we were able to place our food order and came back about 10 minutes later to take it. We both went for the standard Indian fare; he chose the murgh (chicken) tikka masala and I chose the chicken chettinadu. We also got plain and garlic naan and the veg samosas.  The samosas arrived are were really quite good, not greasy at all. However, there were only 2 and they were $7. I know Copper is an upscale joint, so I expected the prices, but $7 for 2 veg samosas seems a bit unreasonable to someone who has eaten Indian food before. I think the naan was $3 for 6 quarter rounds, I think you get quite a bit more for your money at other places, but all in all, it was tasty and worth the $3.  Our food finally arrived (it really took a long time considering Indian food is always pre-prepared and just has to be ladled into bowls, probably about 25-30 minutes). The best way for me to describe both of our entrees would be \"Meh.\" Perhaps they're catering to a more \"upscale crowd\" or just to the masses, but the curries were hardly spicy at all and there were quite literally, only, at most, 10 small chunks of chicken in each of our bowls. I love going to Indian restaurants and being able to select my spice level, but that's not the case at Copper. You get standard, mild, American curry whether you like it or not (maybe you can ask for spicier?). I also LOVE the left-overs you typically get at an Indian restaurant. \"Free\" lunch the next day is probably one of the best parts! The portions here are quite small, so don't expect lunch.   Aside from being totally average, the chicken tikka masala was $17. Let me repeat that, SEVENTEEN DOLLARS. For a child's portion of chicken tikka masala. My chicken chettinadu was $19, for an equally child-like portion. I suppose if you've never eaten Indian food anywhere else and have a money-tree in your yard, this is probably a great deal. However, I got got by Copper. Our check for 2 entrees, naan, one appetizer and a bottle of wine (one of the cheapest on the list) was $120. For super average Indian food. Bummer.  I realize, from other reviews, that people REALLY love Copper. Like, are OBSESSED with it. I, however, cannot join the masses and sing the praises of Copper, it's just not that good and it's incredibly over-priced. Granted, they have to pay for that super swanky East Blvd. address, but the food is nothing to go crazy over. My recommendation: Save your money and hit a hole in the wall place where $20 will get you enough food for 3 days, will actually have some flavor to it, and you'll get more service than you probably even want (and all the yummy freebies the hole in the wall places give you to snack on!)."}
{"text":"Have I never reviewed Copper? Oh my...time to change that. Copper is the best Indian Food in Charlotte. It has a great, intimate atmosphere. This is a go to place for date night. The food has always been excellent here. I usually get Samosa's as an appetizer, Chicken Tikka Marsala as the main meal, with a couple of sides. The garlic naan, and Naan with peas in it amazing. They also have a nice wine list.  Do yourself a favor, take your date to Copper, get a glass of wine, order some of the best tasting food ever, and enjoy the good life, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Copper exceeded all of my expectations, first visit.  Service was on point, very friendly. Food was awesome! I had Chicken Tikka, and craved it the entire following day.  The Naan was so fluffy and flavorful (garlic). Paired the meal with an Indian Blanc wine, which complemented perfectly Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"a good selection of interesting fusion or classic Indian fares but not everything passes the test on the menu. the wine by the glass selection is poor. The location is nice and restaurant comfortable. During warm days the terrace in the front is very pleasant."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Copper with a large group of friends the other night.  I had been drooling over the menu for a week or so when we had made plans to go.  I definitely was not disappointed with my experience here!    Our waiter was super awesome and very charming - he had this dry sense of humor that really worked especially with a big group.  My favorite line that came from him was when we were asking about heat levels and someone had mentioned they wanted a \"kick\".... and he responded with a dead-serious look on his face:  \"flying kick\" or \"regular kick\".... I was rolling on the floor laughing and it took a couple of my friends a repeat of what was just said to get them on board with my flailing of hands and obnoxious laughter.  Not sure if every table gets this, but we were a table of six and we got a basket of regular Naan with 3 different dipping sauces.  Super delicious.  I was feeling very adventurous that night and saw that the first course selections had a \"Soup of the Day\".... I totally ordered it without asking what it was.  Our waiter replied that the soup was Tomato.... and I was a bit saddened, but still ordered it anyway.  Later he came back and said he was mistaken and the soup was a coconut bell pepper soup.  Sounded great, and was a great surprise.  Best accidental soup of the day ordering ever.  When the soup came, I had to let everyone try it because it was just THAT good.  It was everything that the name promised and more.  My main course was the Saunfiya Kesri Chicken which was on the \"modern\" section.  Who wouldn't pick it based on its description alone?:  Saffron-Fennel Roasted Chicken Breast, Fennel-Chive Creme, Mixed Vegetables!!!!!!  There was a heavy hand of black pepper on the veggies that I really really really really enjoyed and it went perfect with the chicken.  I wanted to fill an Olympic-sized pool with the creme sauce and do laps in it.  Having a really good time with the food, I convinced my friend to split a dessert with me and we partook in the \"Three Excuses\"... they had great dessert names on the menu.  The excuses included a flour-less \"Callibaut\" chocolate torte, gulab jamun, baileys kulfi.  ALL WERE GREAT and a nice way to end the meal.  Felt a little guilty when the check came - I had 2 glasses of wine with my meal and probably spent way more than I should for one person for one dinner, but I enjoyed it tremendously.  Other than the prices being a bit high for some of the dishes and a small side parking lot situation, this place is a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Who knew I would like Indian food so much.  I am usually adventurous in trying new cuisines but have stayed away from Indian for some reason.  Tonight's experiment with Copper during Restaurant Week made me fall in love with the flavors.  First off we started off with Naan and 3 sauces.  Who needs sauce when the naan was delicious on its own?  But the chutney, yogurt and fruit sauces all were flavorful.  For the first course everyone at my table ordered the Tamarind-Curry Leaf Prawns.  It came with 4 tasty prawns spiced just right and a cucumber roll.  Yummmm.  For the 2nd course, I ordered the Thecha Rubbed Tawa Chicken Thigh which started out a little spicy but my mouth got used to it.  The chicken was very tender and the sauce was addicting!  The vegetable medley that came with was quite tasty as well.  The other two people dining with me ordered the Seafood \"MelJol\" which they said was excellent.  The dessert selection was different than what was described on the Restaurant week website.  It was light and with a puddling-like texture with a fruit drizzle but I forget the name.  Our waiter described it as \"like Cream of Wheat\".  To me, that's comfort food.  It was light and amazing.  Service was excellent.  Someone was always around taking plates, refilling drinks or replacing silverware.  This is definitely some place I need to come back to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"I think this Indian restaurant tops one of my Indian restaurant to go to, which is Blue in Ballantyne. Everything we got from the menu was really good. Here's the list of what we got. -Masala-Chili Cauliflower Florets -Murgh Tikka Masala  -Radios Aloo Aur Pakode -Mango Lasse  However, the one downside is eating at this restaurant was eating outside at night. We could not see the menu at all and had to use our flashlight on our phone to see the menu. Other than that, it's a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I go to a restaurant that, upon leaving, makes me keep thinking about when I can return. Copper is the only restaurant in recent memory that's caused me to feel this way.   I had lunch at Copper for the first time 3 weeks ago, and since then, I've thought about it at least once every other day (if not daily).   I can't say that I've ever had bad Indian food. Indian restaurants, to me, have always been more or less the same when it comes to taste of food and ambiance. Copper, on the other hand, takes Indian dining to a whole different level:  Food: Had the mango lassi, naan, and Saag Paneer (my go-to Indian dish). Everything was spot-on and amazingly flavorful. Probably the best Saag Paneer I've had.   Ambiance: One of the things that set Copper art was their location - a historic house-turned-restaurant - in the heart of South End.   Service: attentive, but not intrusive.   Lunch at Copper was far better than most dinners I've had at other Indian restaurants. Looking very much forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The cold weather is on the horizon so what better way to warm up than by filling the ol' bread basket with some curry! I highly recommend the delicious Punjabi Gosht - a richly seasoned spicy lamb curry. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This was a such a great find in Charlotte. From the moment you walk in the door it smells heavenly with a variety of spices. All of the staff was outstanding, they checked on our table throughout our dinner. Our water glasses were constantly refilled. My husband enjoyed the chicken tiki masala and I ordered another chili chicken dish. The app we tried was a spicy chicken in coconut milk and don't even get me started on the garlic naan. There is also an interesting drink menu. Whenever we visit charlotte we will definitely return!"}
