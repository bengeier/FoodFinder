{"text":"Service here is great and food came out very quick, I've been here multiple times for both breakfast and dinner and I have been very pleased with the food every time. They have a wide selection of breakfast items, and surprisingly very good burgers and other dinner items. Would recommend for someone who's looking for a quick bite to eat and still have quality food."}

{"text":"Simply fantastic food and service!  I had a veggie omelet with hash browns. A simple order that was a feast. First, it was delicious. Everything tasted super healthy. The hash browns were not greasy. Whole sliced potatoes with cheese were unusual in the hash brown world. The omelet was one of the tastiest that I've ever eaten.  Second, the portions were HUGE! It was literally enough for two people. I took pictures of the meal before and after. I left about a third on the plate after stuffing myself. Perhaps I could have finished it all but my belt would have complained at the strain.  Third, the waitress had a phenomenal energy and spirit. Who serves the food impacts the enjoyment of the meal. Even the chef came to the dining area and asked everyone about the quality of their meal while patting them on the shoulder.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Impressive small town restaurant. The staff was friendly and fast. The prices reflect a small town (very reasonable) but the food tastes like something from a very fancy hotel. Potatoes were not greasy, eggs were buttery and the bacon was salty, just the way I like it. K had biscuits and gravy and a side of sausage patties. He didn't leave an ounce of food behind and almost licked his plate clean, lol. We also had two pops and our bill was only $15! We will definitely be coming back here for more deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Great food! We stopped to do some marketing for Mercury Wireless Internet provider in Monroeville and got hungry... Breakfast and pancakes... Yes, yes this is the place!"}
