{"text":"OMG what a terrible effin' restaurant. It's about the same price as Madison's Steakhouse but the portions are crap, the quality is at the level of St. Hubert's and it is NOT at ALL high-end no matter how hard they're trying to position themselves.  The ribs were COLD when they were served, the steak was just.. some crap steak I could have bought at Costco and pan-fried myself. No grill marks, nothing delicious about what I got. I even asked for RARE. BLUE RARE and I got it overcooked. Terrible. TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Went there for the $9 special baby back ribs after 9 pm.  Turned out you need to order two portions of the special.   So better bring a buddy along unless you can eat 2-person portions.  Kind of sneaky since they didn't mention that on their advertisement.  The ribs are not that great, very mediocre.  I ordered a side of grilled vegetables but couldn't eat them because they were so burnt that I'm afraid I'll get cancer eating all that carcinogen.  Fortunately the waitress was nice to take it back and not charge me for the inedible plate.  Overall not a great dining experience.  Will not be back again."}
{"text":"The only good meal was the ribs and fries.  The service was excruciatingly slow. We were 8 of us. Won't go back."}
