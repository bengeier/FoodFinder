{"text":"The food itself was amazing, the portions were on the smaller side tho. The staff was great too! 
What really has me wondering if I'll go back is how their seating/reservations were done. I called a half hr before for a reservation and they had no record of me calling!! There was also no clear line of wear to go to put your name in to get a table. We got shoved in a booth up front basically where the line was formed."}
{"text":"I've been going here since they opened, once it twice a week. I've always enjoyed the food, but it's improved even more recently, without a price increase.

I find the food and drink prices to be reasonable. The chips are always warm, and the salsa had just enough kick to it.

The staff here are always friendly.

Though they except Belly, I stopped using it months ago when I realized the restaurants that pay for the service don't get anything, other than some new, first time customers. If you like a restaurant, I recommend you not use Belly to keep from taking profits from the hard working people who run restaurants.

Also, the original Don Patrons, in Hudson, is in no way affiliated with the knock off restaurant that used their name in Streetsboro. I have no interest in going to the knock off. Stick with the original."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice, however, the food is bland and the service is terrible. It took almost 20 minutes for our waiter to come and take our order, and we were the only customers in the place. I had the fajita, which had no flavor. My husband tried a chicken adobe, which was also bland (and he's not a very picky eater). The waiter was weird about it, but  the manager was nice."}
{"text":"Yesterday, Sunday, offers a jumbo margarita for only $5.00, so of course I tried one. It was very good and you can actually taste the tequila in it. Also tried the cheese dip ($3.50). Excellent! their salsa is a little bit spicy, so if you don't like heat go directly to the cheese dip. If you do like spicy you will enjoy the taste of their salsa.

For dinner I had the Cozumel, a flour tortilla filled with pork and cooked with onions and bell peppers, covered with cheese and brown sauce ($10.99). When I say it was filled with pork, I mean it was stuffed. Seared nicely, the pork was just full of flavor. They do it right! Everything they produced was just dripping with taste. Now I have a dilemma: When I return should I try something different or stay with something I know is good? Such a problem!

The only problems I encountered are I had to remind the waiter that I ordered a margarita. He apparently forgot. I also had to remind him I ordered the cheese dip, even though two of us ordered cheese dip at the same time and he served the other person right away. Also, one of the party had a shrimp fajita and complained the shrimp was sparse. But another person had a shrimp burrito and said the burrito was full of shrimp. So I can only go by what I ate and my meal (I will excuse the waiter this one time because of the quality of the food and hope he gets better as time goes on) was as good as it gets."}
{"text":"I'm thankful for the plentiful selection of good Mexican restaurants in my area. And this one is right up there with the rest. Great price for lunch, friendly staff, fresh food. I will defiantly make this a regular lunch spot!"}
{"text":"What a great meal! The fajitas Vallarta were a mixture of chicken, beef, and shrimp. The guac was better than what I make at home and the cheese dip was perfect! The restaurant is set up well, each table has some privacy, which is nice when you have a toddler.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Mexican food! Super fast service and a great value. Some of the best queso dip you'll ever have!"}
{"text":"The service was great and it was very crowded today but the food really needs working on. We ordered fajitas and carne asada. The meat was overcooked ( very well done very well done and very dry). The rice was hard. And the beans were cold ( even on the 2nd order). And we ordered a chicken quesadilla and it pretty much just had chicken and a sprinkle cheese; we had to send it back to more cheese added.
I don't believe will be returning back to this location"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Hudson. I have lived about 5 miles away from it for years, and I have never ventured there before. I went for the first time last week, and it did not disappoint. While it did take a few minutes longer than usual to get the waiter's attention to get our drink order, the food was good and the service was uphill after that. It was also super affordable, and my friend, who is a vegetarian, said that there was a solid veggie menu to choose from (I don't usually pay attention to those things, but I thought I would add that tidbit in for anyone interested)."}
{"text":"Some nice music by a duo on a Saturday night. Had a chicken dish with the special sauce and the sauce was so salty. When I tried to explain it to the waiter he appeared to not understand what I was telling him. The saltiness made the chicken inedible. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Portions were small to very small. And all of our meals were room temperature at best, although the plates were hot. We aren't really planning on going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Friendly staff. Good value. This is now our preferred Mexican restaurant in Hudson."}
{"text":"First off the chips and salsa are great, soapy tasting like sone other places. I love fresh ingredients when I eat out. Don Patron new Streetsboro location was just that. I tried the Mexican sausage in the creamy white cheese and now am in love. For my entree I had the burritos deluxe , again everything was fresh and tastes amazing. Priced like you would expect for the type and area. I'll be Bach:)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Hudson, much better than the one downtown. Very good service and about half the time, they treat us to a free shot of tequila, I like that."}
{"text":"Oh my god!  What did I do?!  I love this place!  The food is great and the staff is even better"}
{"text":"With Mexican restaurants pretty much around every corner nowadays, I would say this place is pretty average..

Lightning fast service and the food comes out within just a few minutes of ordering  which is impressive. So if you want to get in and out it's a plus. They have a pretty big menu but my go to every time is the fajitas. It's not that they are bad but they are no different from the next Mexican place a couple miles down the road..

Food is good but I wouldn't say it's authentic. They have this really good homemade hot salsa that I would recommend trying. 

They don't really have a bar but it seems as if they have all your typical drink specials that you would typically see at a place like this. If your passing through the area I would recommend a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with my wife. We usually go to the other \"Mexican \" restaurant in town. Had a great dinner from a restaurant run by people who know how to make good Mexican food. This is my new stop for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Nice staff and decor at strip mall location - dining room can get loud during busy times. Food was abundant and well flavored with my combo meal being good but not great. Good chips and salsa, I look forward to trying a signature dish."}
{"text":"Okay we LOVE this place. Staff is so friendly and the food was delicious! Bf said the burrito Durango was the best burrito he's ever had and they offered him a shot when he told them that! The shredded chicken soft tacos are so good. Salsa fresh, chips warm. We skipped Luchitas for this place and SO glad we did. Don't forget to use Belly app to earn points when you come!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Hudson. Do not bother going anywhere else. There might be a better location for Mexican food in Hudson, but you will be very sadly disappointed if you make that choice. Don Patron is real Mexican. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great Mexican - everything is fresh and the service is FAST! We enjoyed guacamole, fish tacos, a combo platter, and fajitas (the serving for one easily serves two), a cheese quesadilla, and margaritas. Everything was tasty! Best Mexican place in Hudson and Twinsburg. We ended the meal with shots on the house! Best service I've had in a while. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are very tasty and very affordable. Table salsa is particularly good."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove twenty minutes out of our way, after having nearly nothing to eat yet that day, to try it because of the great reviews.  When we walked in the place was empty except for one couple in the back.  Phones were ringing and we we're ignored for about fifteen minutes.  When a waiter finally walked out from the kitchen, he looked right at us, turned around and walked back in the kitchen without a word.  Not a good first impression, will not go back, and would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been here about a dozen times. Great food and great staff. I also use my Belly app and got a free meal recently. It's definitely my preferred Mexican restaurant in Hudson."}
{"text":"Take out from here was a nightmare. Ordered an order of chicken nachos, and was asked when I ordered if I wanted shredded chicken or grilled, I stated grilled, and was not asked for/given any more information, nor did the menu provide information regarding the difference between the two options. Also ordered a beef taco, which was repeated to me on the telephone at the end of the order. My husband arrived home with the food, and the nachos consisted of chips, pieces of grilled chicken, and melted cheese, that's all. Really? No taco was included in the bag. I called, and they said that there is a price difference between the shredded chicken and grilled chicken nachos, and only the shredded option comes with veggies, lettuce, etc (what one would assume an order of nachos comes with). Would have been nice to have been told that when ordering. No offer to rectify order, other than coming back in. At almost 9p on a week day, no thank you. We won't be returning, which is a shame, as this was our first trip here."}
{"text":"This was the second time ordering take out. I haven't dined in the restaurant so I can't comment on that aspect.

When I placed the order, I was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. I did not arrive for approximately 20, because I had to wait last time. When I arrived I had to wait another 10 to 15 minutes for them to bring the food out. I had to pick this up on my half hour lunch break from work, so I was a little late getting back and that could have been prevented by telling me it would be about a half an hour instead of 10 minutes. They were busy the first time I went, but this time they only had 4 or 5 customers.

The food tastes good but it was lukewarm at best. They place their take out orders in foil containers so it was difficult to reheat. 

The staff is friendly and seemed attentive. I'll probably come back, but I just wish their food was warmer and they would have given an accurate wait time."}
{"text":"Great service from the minute we walked in the door. Staff couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming. Food was delivered to our table promptly and was nice and warm and tasted great. Our server kept our drinks full, answered our questions, and made suggestions on menu items. The manager also came around with a complimentary queso dip. I highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"It has been a very long time since I found a really good Mexican place. I have definitely found my new favorite Mexican restaurant! The nachos with cheese were awesome, the taquito was awesome, the cheese quesadilla was awesome, and the Spanish rice was awesome! Service was super fast and the place is clean a nicely decorated, I will definitely be back to try more!!"}
{"text":"This is my Family's favorite Mexican restaurant. For the last several years we have enjoyed many delicious meals here. I normally get the chicken or steak fajitas. Believe me I am a big guy but I always have some food leftover for lunch the next day. The staff is courteous and attentive. On our last visit the Manager sent us a couple of shots of their house tequila. Wow!!!  Felt like my entire body was being warmed up from the inside. Many thanks for the kind gesture. Looking forward to many more delicious meals."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican spot in Hudson. Recommend the arroz con pollo and the margaritas are awesome! Service has always been 100%"}
{"text":"My wife and I brought the kids here on a Saturday night.   We usually go to dinner early if we have the kids in tow.  We got there about 5:45 and we were seated immediately. (Which is usually a tall task because we have a child that requires a booster plus one in a car seat still).  We ordered draft Modelo Especial which is great because it's normally hard to find on draft.  The beer came in these giant mugs.  For a second I thought it was a mistake because the mugs were enormous.  It turns out the bottom of the mug had some sort of chilling component that made it so big.  $5 and change is a great deal for the 25oz drafts.  The food was very tasty.  We got the fajitas for two with a mix of chicken and steak.  The veggies were very fresh and the meat was pretty good.  The steak might have been a little overdone but it was still good.  Overall the quality was very good and seemed very fresh.  The kids got the children's taco meals.  It was a good portion of food for $5.  Overall it was a pretty great meal and the service was excellent.  Our waiter was very attentive and we got a shot of tequila to cap the meal!  I knocked a star off due to the over cooked beef but we will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Just moved to Stow and am hoping to find a new favorite Mexican restaurant in the area.  I've tried Don Patron a couple of times and found it decent enough.  But tonight, we stopped in at 9:10 (according to the sign on the door, the restaurant is open until 10:30), were seated immediately, and then ignored.  We weren't even able to flag down a server.  We left, thirsty and hungry, at 9:25.

Two stars for decent food and service on our two previous visits.  Alas, the search continues."}
{"text":"Being a Southern Californian, I am very spoiled when it comes to Mexican food!  Don Patron definitely rose to my expectations! Their chips were fresh and light.  Their salsa had just the right amount of spice!  Texas margarita was a perfect blend.  Portions very generous and food quality great!!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered lunch fajitas and I was satisfied with the takeout order.  I need to go back for dinner and sit down next time."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this Mexican restaurant while planning a movie date. Love the chips and prob the best Salsa. Huge menu and many  combination choices. We really love the service. This will be our go to spot for Mexican"}
{"text":"We have eaten here about a half dozen times.   The staff are always friendly and helpful.   I have ordered a variety of dishes from vegan to steak.  The food has been  consistently quite good.  We continue to return because  of these reasons."}
{"text":"Great service and a fun atmosphere- fun music with lively patrons. I ordered the number 5 combo- 2 enchiladas, rice, and refried beans. I was pleasantly surprised. Satisfies the Mexican food craving in a comfortable atmosphere!"}
