{"text":"I'm updating my review because I was recently in the store and they had a lot more stock (gift items), so the store is much fuller. I didn't have a really long time to look around, but I will be back because it looked like they had some interesting stuff. 

We did have ice cream cones. The server was very friendly. She was also open at least 15 minutes past the scheduled close time - the servers here are excellent and have been well trained. 

I can't give it a 5-star rating because I haven't been able to try the sandwiches or baked goods this year."}
{"text":"Perfect ice cream pit stop! We stopped here after an invigorating hike through the Belfountain Conservation area to view the waterfall. They had lots of ice cream flavours, various specialty sodas (bottled), and super friendly staff and a counter filled with fresh baked treats. We had the best peach rhubarb pie - à la mode (is there any other way to have it?)

The shop had a few curated knick knacks like scented candles, and bottle openers, home decor stuff etc. Seems like a lot of it was neat, locally made contemporary stuff (not your grandma's souvenir shop). 

The owner must really love dogs as the doggie treat section rivalled the human treats. Fur babies are welcome, I guess. Lots of picnic tables outside with patio umbrellas to provide shade. Customer bathrooms are porta-potties unfortunately, but if u need a real flusher you can use the one in the park if u were going that way anyway."}
{"text":"Cute place to grab an ice cream, coffee, sandwich, muffin, etc. before/after your hike at Belfountain!  According to the woman behind the counter, they just opened this past April.

What I tried was quite fresh, including a butternut squash soup, pumpkin spice muffin (~$2, more subtle in taste and not super sweet), and a savoury pastry ($3).  Coffee was well-priced at under $2, but I didn't grab a cup.  

There is seating inside, but I found it a bit noisy as the competition across the street was a biker hang out.  If you want a bit more peace and less car exhaust, sit on the other side of the Café out on the picnic tables.

Nice place to watch the world go by!"}
