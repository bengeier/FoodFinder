{"text":"I ordered delivery. I've tried a variety of Indian places and this was probably the worst. Also, I ordered it for a specific time and they showed up two hours early."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in our neighborhood. Several times we walked by and saw that it was empty. We wanted to support a new place, but still we were a bit nervous to try it. I am so glad we did. The food was excellent. We tried  tandoori fish, butter chicken, naan bread, and two vegetable dishes. They were all very good. The server seemed a bit inexperienced,  but since it wasn't crowded this wasn't a problem. This will be one of our regular restaurants."}
{"text":"I hate to rag on a place that's already down, so I'll keep this short. 

Went for lunch, and even though it's 20% cheaper than alternatives close by, it just is not worth the money or stomach space. Literally, nothing good to say.

Don't go."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as it's very near to my house and I love Indian cuisine. Unfortunately, this was not the case.

I tried the buffet lunch and was not impressed. The tandoori chicken was really dry; the butter chicken was too sweet and the chicken tasted like the cheaper thigh meat, rather than chicken breast.

There were a few vegetarian options but nothing particularly tasty.

There are definitely better options in the area. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very mediocre, bland food, NO LABELS ON THE BUFFET ITEMS, rice was dry and crunchy, naan was thin and crunchy, not soft and chewy/fluffy, unimpressive overall. Don't bother."}
{"text":"I ordered food from this place from \"orderit.ca\"

Wow! I wish i would have read these yelp reviews before i placed my order. By far the worst indian food i have ever had, and they charge top dollar for their food. My advise to the restauranteur is to take up another profession. 

The chicken tikka is terrible, curry is not authentic at all. They advertise that they use a tandoori oven and I'm sure they don't even know what that is. 

I paid an extra few $ for papadums and i got these plastic tasting curled up things that i couldn't even think about finishing. 

Their rice was also terrible, but edible, because its rice! Their naan bread was hilarious because its not even cooked in a clay oven! I Ordered keema naan and it was like ordering a flattened roll stuffed with a bic-mac patty. 

I think its sad that they charged me $40 (a fair price for my order of it was from a real indian restaurant). 

Lucky i had frozen pizza in the fridge.

I hope they close these place and save everyone from wasting their money because they just assume that Toronto always has decent indian foods."}
{"text":"Here's the deal: this place can do it right, depending on your expectations. The food is average at best, but the price is great at worst. 

For instance, get the vegetarian dinner special. It's a big plate with a bunch of stuff for not much money. Simply put. 

It'll fill you up, you'll be able to satisfy that hankering for savory Indian food, and it won't hurt the wallet. 

If you want to relish the complexity of this beautiful cuisine, Gau isn't the place for you. But if you just want a quick fill up with some Indian character, it does the trick."}
{"text":"I live pretty close to this place, and have called in orders for pick up a few times. The food is quite good, and the prices are comparable to the other Indian restaurants in the neighbourhood. I am not sure why this place has received such poor reviews. To be honest, I actually prefer the food here over Banjara, as it is less rich and does not make me feel sick after I eat it (like Banjara does). I recommend this place, and hope it gets more support from the community in the upcoming months."}
{"text":"We are BIG fans. I have eaten in only a couple times. Takeout - probably had it 6-8 times and always right on.  I haven't ordered by delivery so I cant comment on that. Usually I walk in, order, take a stroll, adn come back 25 min later and evverything ready to go.  Every dish we've tried was generous in portion and very tasty. Also, they package things really well - the food stays hot, organized, and never soggy the way it can be at some places.  Prices are competitive with similar places. It was nice to walk in last Saturday and see every table taken."}
{"text":"We used to order from Gau all the time but now every time we try their phone rings but no one answers. Are they closed or don't want the business?"}
{"text":"Gau was wonderful! My boyfriend recommended this joint when he went here for lunch from work. We went for dinner.

The restaurant was empty. Very empty. The only thing that was making noise was a very annoying buzz coming through the speakers. I asked our waitress to turn their sound off so the buzz wouldn't be coming off, but she opted to play music instead which was nice. 

The food was good, I only had a butter chicken roti and it was delicious! It was tons of food and I saved the rest for lunch the next day. Our waitress was delightful and everyone who was working inside seemed very grateful that we were eating in their restaurant and wanted to make our experience great. They succeeded. My only complaint is that the butter chicken was pretty sweet.

All in all, it was an enjoyable experience and I'll be back."}
