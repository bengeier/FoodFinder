{"text":"I found Deli Roma too late.  Fortunately, I was able to enjoy the godfather part I several times this winter before it closed.  This was my favorite sandwich, anywhere, ever, period.  Sad to see you go, thank you for the delicious food!"}
{"text":"Boar's head meats and cheeses are what they use for their sandwiches, and they also have olives,and some other deli items. The sandwiches are great, and the service is friendly. I miss their old employee John, he was such a charming, handsome young lad. :-( They even know Chris Burke!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is insanely good.  Fresh meats and very, very tasty.  When you order a sandwich (i recommend the godfather I or II), the owner goes to the fridge and begins slicing cuts for your sub.  Doesn't get much fresher than that.  They have a few tables, but I've never eaten there so I cannot comment on the service but they are always friendly when I order take out.  In addition to a plethora of sandwich options there are italian dishes as well.  I've had the lasagna which was a large, flavorful portion.  Desserts are great too.  Try a Cannoli."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and never disappointed. Muffulettas are very comparable to those found in N'awlins. Large portions & great pricing, there have been times were we've had to wait sometimes with a lot of people waiting as well, but most of the time there is 1-2 people there and you have to take that into consideration. The food is definitely worth the wait in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Finally went to Deli Roma yesterday and so glad i did. I've been meaning to go for a while but, always forget about it because of it's location. It's small but cool at the same time. All the Italian nostalgia in there is fun to look at while you wait.

We got a veggie muffaletta, grilled panini, and a Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog.

Veggie Muffaletta ($5.25)~ Wow! So much flavor with the olives, 2 kinds of cheese, and the in house olive dressing. Served on a 5\" round Pane Mariano bread (my new favorite bread). Great price for a huge sandwich.

Grilled Panini ($6.49)~ It was the panini of the week, not sure what it was. It had 2 kinds of meat( ham and salami i believe) and cheese. The focaccia bread was grilled to perfection. We got the order to go and it was still super hot when we got home! Tasty sandwich with a TON of meat in there!

Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog ($2.75)~ Very good dog with all the fixings. Only complaint was that it was not very warm but that's OK with a hot dog i guess.

If you can find this place you need to go! The mailman was eating lunch when we were there. I always think if the mailman eats there, you know it's good!"}
{"text":"Deli Roma , the food is GREAT I try and eat there at least once a week .Very TOP NOTCH . Always FRESH and good"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! Just wish it were open on Sunday :)"}
{"text":"Only place in the area that makes an authentic Vienna beef Chicago style hot dog.  Simply awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is amazing to say the least. The only time I have been disappointed is when I showed up on a Monday and found out they were closed. Best place for Italian in the area. Thumbs up to the owner and staff, keep it up!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times - twice to carry out some food, once to eat there.  The food has always been excellent.  It's like a big-city Italian deli, in little old Sun Prairie.  I mark it down a little for the service.  They are rather basic, not exactly unfriendly but you're lucky if you get a mumbled \"Thank you.\"  When I ate in, they were polite enough taking my order, but after my meal I wanted to get some dessert.  I went up to the counter, wallet in hand.  A guy behind the counter (I think he's the owner/manager; I heard him telling a guy about the lengths he goes to to source good meat) walks right by me, looks me in the eye, keeps going without a word, even though I smile and hold up a finger in a friendly \"need some service\" gesture.  I think he must be coming right back, but nothing happens.  After two minutes a younger guy comes out from the back for a reason seemingly unrelated to me, quizically asks, \"Did you need something?\"  I replied \"Yes, I wanted to try some dessert,\" and he seems irritated to be pulled away from whatever he was doing.  After I pay he grabs my dessert, sets it on the counter, looks at me blandly and walks away.

So it's that kind of place.  This didn't ruin my day or anything, I was over it by the time I was out the door - but it's enough to keep me from coming back when there are so many choices out there.  The food is outstanding though, especially The Godfather roast beef sandwich."}
{"text":"Nice little sandwich shop in Sun Prairie and they do a decent job but they have big plastic things of Prosciutto to make them look like a big time Italian deli only one problem...they don't serve Prosciutto on any of their sandwiches and you can't even order it extra.   

They advertise that they have a couple of types of Lasagna and to ask for what they varieties are but they didn't have any when i was there.  

The sandwich I did have was good and they heat up bread that tastes very yummy.  I'll give them another chance."}
{"text":"Been in SP for a year now and only just discovered this place on my way home tonight. Wanted something quick, tasty, and not from a fast food chain. Talk about a good stop. My sandwich was just filled with Boars Head ham, salami, cheese, delicious fresh tomatoes all on excellent toasted bread. Considering the amount of meat and the overall size of this sandwich the $7 and change price was more than reasonable. I'm already looking forward to going back here. Service was pleasant and quick considering there were two people immediately in front of me.  A unique gem in an area of SP dominated mostly by fast food joints.  Only wish they had better roadside presence so I had been able to find them sooner!"}
{"text":"Ross, I hope you're going to show up somewhere else. Sure miss you in SP."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I were planning on having Cousins Subs next door when we seen the sign for Deli Roma. We ventured inside and were greeted by a dining room full of customers. We figured that had to be a good sign. 

I had the panini of the week which consisted of Salami, whole milk Mozzarella cheese, and sun dried tomatoes. My co-worker had the Godfather sandwich part 1. Both of us had food comas afterwards. The portions are huge and my panini could have fed the whole island of Madagascar. 

I plan to go back. Prices were fair in my opinion. Just wish they offered pizza by the slice for lunch time as I don't want/need a whole pie."}
{"text":"I tried Deli Roma after a recommendation from a friend. The service is very slow (unless you're a \"regular,\" then they whip your food out in no time.) I waited far too long for some very simple food that, when I got it, was wrong. 

The Godfather 2 my mother ordered was missing the mushrooms and jus and frankly, just didn't taste that great. They gave us a fully loaded hot dog when I ordered a plain one. The cheese bread I ordered was burnt and the two slices were stuck together and inedible.

I really really wanted to like this place, I was hoping for a fantastic find, but in the end, it was a small, dingy deli that caters to a small group of regulars and doesn't seem to care about keeping new customers."}
{"text":"Deli Roma- Great Italian deli.  Large portions.  Sandwich meats are slice to the order.  Perfect tiny dining room with plastic red and white checkered table cloths.  Soooo good. Go there.  Eat!"}
{"text":"By far the best food I've had anywhere on the planet, except possibly my wife's cooking.  I am still distraught that they are closed and hope they will reopen."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and no one was at the front counter.  It's obvious that this is a small mom & pop type operation, which is encouraging because this usually means good food.  But we wouldn't know because no one ever came to the counter.  

There was one couple at a table eating, but no other customers at the time.  There was a dude walking around in the back, he looked right at us, but didn't acknowledge us in any way.  

We stood there for quite a while and looked over the menu repeatedly, hoping that at any moment someone might come forth and say something as simple as \"I'll be right with you\" etc.  Didn't happen.  

I get the whole idea of them not being fast food, and that good food takes time so on and so forth, but that shouldn't also mean \"we will not acknowledge your presence.  Ever.\"  

Three more people came in behind us and proceeded to wait.  There were then five of us crowding around the counter................waiting...................and waiting...........

Here on Yelp I noticed that one complaint had a response from the business, which gives me some hope, but hey guys, I was there, with money in hand and you dropped the ball.........again apparently.  

We walked out after waiting a longgggggg time for nothing.   We may try again some day when we have absolutely nothing better to do.  However, if this is standard operating procedure I don't know that they'll still be around for that \"some day.\""}
{"text":"This is the best place for authentic Italian food.The sandwiches are excellent!!!!!"}
{"text":"Place is pretty good. Have been here a handful of times. I always get the Godfather (1 or 2) which is an Italian beef sandwich. It is really good.  My wife really enjoys the Americano.  Overall I have not had any issues, except for my recent visit.  There was an issue with one sandwich, called up and talked with the owner.  He was very understanding and wanted to make things right, so he gave me a $25 gift card to use the next time I'm there.  I won't let one little issue stop me from eating here."}
{"text":"This place is a great stop for lunch. The sandwiches are huge and they use boars head premium deli meat on their subs. I challenge you to take down a whole one. They also make fresh pasta and lasagna that is to die for. Check This Place Out!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go. Their motto says it all, \"little place, big flavors\" or something like that. It's just really really good."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. IDK what the other guy was talking about complaining about the service. I was greeted with a smile and a friendly conversation while I waited for the old man to make my sandwiches. Reminds me of when I lived on the east coast. Got to love Boar's head."}
