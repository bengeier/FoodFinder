{"text":"Great breakfast fast,  tasty , resteraunt is very clean. Waitresses are very friendly."}
{"text":"For some reason, I love this place. Their onion rings are pretty good and the chicken pita or seafood platter is my go to dish. It's not the best, but it's fair and tasty when hungry."}
{"text":"Our family does breakfast all the time and we enjoy it.  Great prices.. Good food.. The wait staff is always helpful.  The know our orders by heart!"}
{"text":"Very good service.  Their breakfast is very good.  Overall their food is solidly good.  Really wish they would serve breakfast until 2 pm on Sunday."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Decent lunch food. Great prices. Child friendly. Very fast. 
Mixed age customer-base."}
{"text":"I have been to nearly every Showmars in the greater Charlotte metro area.  The food is good when you don't want to spend time in the kitchen.  They always have good specials for family dinner...or just for breakfast.

Showmars is a \"can't miss\" family restaurant with very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Not greeted. Had to go to counter to get drinks refilled. Food seems to be preprepared my steak tips were rubbery and onions and peppers also like rubber.  Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Tasty and cheap fast food with delicious Greek options and a friendly staff. I've had their Gyro pita sandwich and loved it. I would definitely make a return trip here whenever I'm in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Low carbing at Shomars is pretty easy & deliciously do!  This is a review on getting food To-Go from here.

Grilled Chicken Chef Salad is always fresh, and you get a nice big chicken breast (not dry at all), along with hard boiled egg, cucumber, cheese and the usual toppings on a bed of lettuce. Some places make their take-out servings a little smaller but not here.  Nice and big with everything you would get if you are dine-in, all in a nice vented container so your warm chicken doesn't make the rest of it soggy.  2 generous dressings come with it, and they didn't forget the utensils!"}
{"text":"Shomars offers fast, healthy and tasty food. I often try their chicken Santorini pita sandwich. Love the mildly seasoned, grilled meat with sauteed onions and peppers. Taste without the guilt. Very well priced, great fast service. No wonder shomars is always crowded with customers."}
{"text":"I love going to Showmars. They have breakfast, lunch and dinner and their prices are really decent for the amount of food you get. They're quick, family/kid friendly and service is always great at this location. By far one of my favorite places to eat in the Charlotte region."}
{"text":"I've found that when I give three stars, that's sometimes taken as a \"not good\" rating.  But, like it says, it's \"A-OK\".  That's Showmar's...A-OK.  My wife and I  ate breakfast there after a stay at a nearby hotel on the way to Charleston,, SC. The service was very good: efficient and friendly. The food was fine; what you'd expect.  If you're not up for the free stale muffins at the hotel, Showmar's is a good choice.

We liked the value and the service.  We had no \"dislikes\". We'd recommend it to anyone eager for a filling breakfast and good service.  It's family friendly and casual."}
{"text":"Consistently good quality food, quick, lots of veggies and a personable hard-working staff. THE go-to place for breakfast and for lunch."}
{"text":"During our stay in wonderful Huntersville we journeyed to the Renaissance festival and had a great day. Then off to sleep at our hotel. Morning came upon us and our bellies were hangry so what better place to go than Showmars. Here our service was exemplary and the food was amazing. Breakfast began with a wonderful freshly brewed coffee and a cup of hot chocolate. This teased my tongue to wake me enough to devour the omelette that awaited me. 

The omelette of choice was of course the Greek but it is ones recommendation to add kalamata olives. This omelette was stuffed just right with fresh spinach, Roma tomatoes and feta cheese. It was also graced with scallions. Then the potatoes were perfectly seasoned  to compliment the meal with saut√©ed onions. Finally my meal was finished off with some toast and garnished with a wedge of melon and orange."}
{"text":"I was awarded the global domination badge for this check in! I like Greek food and their grilled chicken Greek salad has great flavor, it's healthy and their service is fast."}
{"text":"Came here for a job and decided to stay and eat. Inside, it was nice, clean, and orderly. Just like every other showmars out there...at least good ones. This time I ordered a souvlaki somora. It came out well, like every other showmars...filling. Lunch hours get busy, but starts to die out around 1:30-2.

Nothing really special to note, other than the nice service and the small amount of televisions. And the interesting people that came by this place, it seems like a lot of soccer moms enjoy a lunch here. I think other showmars decked out more tv's, but this one wasn't too bad. In the end, I got my lunch, got filled up, and went onto the next job."}
{"text":"First time here even though I've driven by it many times.  I ordered the Flounder plate for only $7.99.  It is served with my all time favorite, crinkle cut fries and cole slaw but I'm pretty sure I could have subbed them out for one of the other many side dishes.  Aren't there like 20 to choose from?  I may be exaggerating but there is a whole page of sides at the register.   I did see quite a few people order their onion rings.  I will try those next time.  
My husband had the Gyros Pita.  He liked it and did say the gyro meat wasn't heavily spiced like it's served in San Diego.  If you get gyros in San Diego, you will be tasting/burping it up all night and I'm not exaggerating.  Not pleasant at all.  

Service was fast and friendly.  They do get super busy at lunch time but their employees handle it well and with a smile.  It's nice to see friendly employees, something we take for granted.  

I will be back to try the salads.  They look really good too."}
{"text":"Great service of course. The food could be a little more consistent, my go to is the chicken santorini and at times the veggies it comes with can be super greasy and inedible. Don't try the salmon, it's definitely frozen and has the fake pink color that you see in farmed salmons, I tried it once and decided to go back to my usual."}
{"text":"Today's service was much better than the last time I ordered a to go meal here. But I still don't understand why all gyros don't come with tomato and onion. But I wasn't charged for them, so I'm happy.

My first review is below.

Showmars is one of my absolute favorite restaurants. I grew up eating at the various locations throughout Charlotte and Mecklenburg County.

Today when I arrived at the Huntersville location to order dinner to-go, I was as excited as can be being that I no longer live in or near Charlotte. I ordered a canadian fish and shrimp platter and a gyro platter (gyros are my favorite!!!!).

I got my food quickly and hurried to my destination so that I could eat. I open my gyro platter box and realize that I haven't been given ANY toppings. A piece of pita and lamb with no tomato, onion, or tzatziki sauce."}
{"text":"I am normally not a chain guy, but there are times that I head over to Showmars for a quick Gyro.  They do a good job when you have few authentic choices."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in a while. They upgraded the decor including the front door. New tables, chairs and wall decor. Today was the second time I've had breakfast here. Showmars is not trying to be known for having good breakfasts. I had the French toast, scrambled eggs and link sausage. It was unremarkable. French toast was limp and not thick like other places. Sausage was half cooked. Also, they bring you syrup in a tiny, little plastic container instead of a bottle. My server was nice however."}
{"text":"If this review was based only on the quality of the food and the speed of service, I would give it five stars; however, over the past year or so the portions at this location have become noticeably skimpier.  We love to order the gyro dinner and it used to have quite a bit of meat, so much meat that we could take some home for a late night snack. Now there is barely enough to fill us up, and for the price it costs I expect more. I keep going back in hopes they turn it around, but may have to start going to their other locations instead.

Hits: anything they serve with gyro meat, Greek salad, love the crushed ice in their drinks
Misses: onion rings, rice, green beans"}
{"text":"Sing it with me, folks, \"Everybody loves Showmars....and it SHOWS!\" Sorry, I couldn't help myself. But really, for a quick and tasty lunch in Huntersville, this Showmars fits the bill. 

When I first moved to Charlotte years ago and worked in Huntersville, I had a hard time finding a speedy location to grab some good grub. Well, lucky for me, this Showmars is located on Statesville Rd. in between exit 23 & 25. While it can get crowded during lunch hours, I have never (and I mean never) waited more than 5 minutes for my food to be delivered to my table. This is super impressive, especially considering that I was with a party of 10 or so! 

I usually go for the chicken pita or the gyro. These truly are special at Showmars. The quality is present and the food is consistent - regardless of the location. You know, sometimes you just need a soft carby pita filled with tantalizing gyro meat. Oh, even though the correct pronunciation of gyro is \"yeer-oh\", the staff will happily take your mis-pronounced order with a smile. And normally I don't venture outside of those two items, but all of the items I've seen come out of the kitchen look fresh and enticing."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice.  Not great, not horrible.  Probably wouldn't go back, though, unless I was with people who wanted to, and then I'd give it another try."}
{"text":"This place has the Worst customer service Ever! Waited 5-10 mins before anyone even acknowledge my presence. Food was okay should went to Mickey D's will next time."}
{"text":"Really good place to eat and reasonably priced. Our 5 and 7 year old shared a Cheese pita. I had a gyro and it was delicious, my five year took several bites! We purchased 2 baklava, had them heated and thoroughly enjoyed them. Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"This isn't 4 Stars when compared to all other restaurants, but 4 Stars for what Showmars is designed to be. It really comes down to expectations. If your expectations are low, you will be pleasantly surprised. If your expectations are high, you might be disappointed. The burger is good (not great). The fries are good (not great). The chocolate chip cookies are good (not great). Detecting a pattern here? As far as service goes, it's excellent."}
{"text":"Giving 1 star because I can't give zero.  Today I was reminded why I have not been back here in a year or so.  I used to love the gyro combo, but today, this place found a new low.

So I order extra catsup for the fries in my to go combo, because they have gotten so tight with stuff and guess what? They loaded it on the gyro!  Does anyone get catsup on a gyro??

Fries were cold, they give you your drink with soda all over the outside so that you have to ask for a napkin to wipe it off (they used to be on the tables).  And on top of that, the gyro meat was barely above room temperature.

That's it... Done."}
{"text":"When you ask an employee for ketchup and they say, \"It's already in the bag Miss.\" *smirk face* Great customer service."}
{"text":"Its more of a fast food place so if your not looking for that , go someplace  else. You place your order and then go sit and wait for it. We thought it was more of a diner place. They do have good senior specials though.."}
{"text":"I love to go to Showmars for breakfast.  It is fast and made to order and just enough food to fill my tummy, supplemented by plenty of coffee!  The restaurant is typically full on any given day and weekends may require a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"They're a decent breakfast option, served 7 days a week.  Today I had two good-sized pieces of country-fried steak with eggs, home fries, and a biscuit for $5.99; usually I get one egg with smoked sausage (w/ home fries and biscuit or toast) for $4 or $5.  They used to have butterscotch shakes -- not sure if they still do.  Breakfast is waited, while lunch and dinner, you order at the counter; I just come here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Every Showmars location I've ever tried has been the same.  A tried and true formula, whether for breakfast or lunch, of decent food, served quickly, and at a fair price.  The Huntersville location is no exception.

Breakfast has all the southern staples you are looking with the requisite eggs, sausage, bacon, grits, hashbrowns, etc.  But they go the extra mile with options such as smoked sausage and livermush.  I've never had livermush but actually do like liver so, somone tell me I'm missing something if indeed I am.  They have breakfast sandwiches on a variety of different baked goods, biscuits, toast, english muffins, and also serve a decent pancake.

For lunch there are plenty of choices as well with Pita Burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads and fried seafood like flounder platters and sandwiches.  Like breakfast, everything is prepared fresh and very quickly.  I believe they bill the flounder sandwich as \"worlds best\" or something.  I don't know if that is true but, I referred my nephew to a Showmars as he was passing through town a year ago and he said it was one of the best he's ever had.  For the price, I have to agree...

I'll sing with Nicole... \"Everybody loves Showmars....\""}
