{"text":"I'll keep it simple. It's winter, it's cold... I want soup, and Pho Bac 97 is my go-to pho place. Go for the beef pho with tribe with the classic ingredients: tendon, tripe, &meatballs. Because I only go there with one dish in mind, I am always satisfied."}
{"text":"MMMHH si vous voulez déguster de bons Bo Bun cet endroit est parfait !!"}
{"text":"I agree with the reviewers who state that this is a solid, but unspectacular place for Pho.  This is from my opinion as a Seattle native, Vietnamese-born, picky foodie.  

As with most Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown/International District locales, the seating is humble, the restrooms are dirty, the service is decent, and you would be wise to wipe down your eating utensils prior to using them.  This is par for the course, and indeed, I feel less than comfortable eating a dish in a fancy place when it is traditionally served from stools on the ground.  

So forget all that.  How's the food?

The Pho broth here has an initial rich, floral scent and taste, but unfortunately, it doesn't last.  The aftertaste tastes strongly of MSG and lacks anise and a good meat base.  

The noodles were oddly cool compared to the soup.  Not undercooked, mind you.  And certainly not overcooked to the point of bursting and falling apart.  

The variety of meats was good.  They could have been sliced more thinly.  

The garnishes were decent, with lime, bean sprouts, and Thai basil.  Pho places get extra points in my book when they include culantro (\"ngo gai\").  The vegetables seemed quite fresh and fragrant.  

So all in all, Pho Bac 97 is a pretty good place.  Perhaps I had an off-day, but I was their first customer that day, so doubtful."}
{"text":"Je pense que je n'aime pas le pho finalement. Ça manque de goût, les nouilles ne sont pas aussi l'fun à manger que les nouilles de ramen, le bouillon est blah. Une des sortes de viande était un peu moins appétissante à mon goût avec des longues languettes de gras. Service très gentil et rapide et prix très abordables."}
{"text":"The pho didn't taste that much better than other places; the raw onion slivers they chopped in was supppperrrrr spicy...I understand that cheap sweet onions are hard to come by in winter, but the least they could have done is soak it in water to get the sharp, spiciness out...

The place is dingy and sticky, and the service....the waiters are quite curt and rude.

I would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Pas très propre.  Sur un groupe de quatre tout le monde a été incommodé (maux de têtes, problèmes gastriques)."}
{"text":"Mes commentaires étaient élogieux après ma première visite.... j'y suis retourné et ce fût la grosse déception.... nourriture peu appétissante, insipide, la viande n'était en fait que du gras.... je n'y retournerai plus jamais"}
{"text":"If you're freezing or nursing a cold or a hangover, pho is our household's go-to remedy. It was -15C / 5F out so we blazed our way here for a warm bowl of pho. My preference is pho ga (chicken), and after having a bowl of pho ga with beef broth at one place and another place that didn't have any chicken broth, I was very excited when the waiter gave me a \"of course, we have chicken broth!\" look. Third times a charm. 

After taking my first sip of my soup, ahhh, it hit the spot!  I was a little disappointed that I'd had whiffs of bleach even after the usual ritual wipe down of utensils. They also didn't have coriander. Cilantro and pho ga go together like salt on fries. It just gives it that extra umph. 

Nevertheless, the meat portions are generous and the soup is hearty. I've had way worse and better ones. Have to admit, it's also pretty impressive when the guys who work here are switching between all the different languages. It's only my 3rd pho joint in Montreal so I'd like to try others before I come back, and I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there... and I must say that the Tonkinoise beef soup was better than I expected. As a PHO/Tonkinoise lover, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"first meal in montreal?real good soup.superb?tres délicieux!Je le aime!suggested by friends,the price is real good,the special is really worth a try!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Chinatown by far.

I've been coming here regularly for about 3-4 years now, and while I must admit that the quality can fluctuate a bit, generally I've found that the components that make up the pho are better than any other place I've been to in china town. The broth is tastier than other places, with the right amount of fat and not overly sweet or salty like many other places do. The noodles are generally the right amount of cookedness and consistency, and the meat is always fairly high quality."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pho I've had. Period. Full stop. I feel bad even writing about this place because it's hard enough to get seated during the lunch and dinner rush. 

*tip* have the pho tai w/ a side of extra beef. The meat isn't your usual frozen inside round cut - it's fresh, tasty and mouth watering.  Thank me later."}
{"text":"My favourite pho in the city!  The perfect thing to warm you up after a long day in the snow.  Staff is super friendly and helpful.  The service is very speedy.  

The portion size is generous, but not overwhelming.  The broth is always rich and fragrant, never been disappointed! The veggies are fresh, and accompaniments are authentic."}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the rough! We did a quick search of the best food along the main Chinatown strip and Pho Bang New York popped up. That place wasn't satisfying enough so we did a quick search again and found Pho Bac! The food was great! No skimming on portions and friendly staff. Everything was quick and pleasant. We're going back just because of how wonderful of an experience it was. I definitely recommend this place and it's cheaper than Pho Bang and right across the street! Cross the street and have much better food!"}
{"text":"This is a solid, good place for pho. I really appreciate that they offer the dish in 3 sizes, even if the \"small\" isn't actually small. Most places give you a giant bowl of pho and call it good; here you are allowed to have some control over how much food you're requesting. I also really appreciate that the veggie pho was actually a star dish instead of regular pho without meat. 

Service was mostly efficient and mostly polite. When we were finishing up and getting ready to leave, our server was in the middle of condiment maintenance, and we had to interrupt him in order to get the check & pay. It's not a big deal, but be aware that you might have to flag somebody down at some point."}
{"text":"My favourite pho place in downtown Montreal. Located in chinatown so it's easy to get to. If you're a fan of beef pho, you'll like this place. The broth is really great on its own. I've been to other pho places where the soup broth was tasteless and had to had tons of hot sauce to enhance the taste, but this place does it right. Also a fan of their fried springrolls. I've tried their rice paper rolls and weren't that impressed, so I would stick to the fried ones if you like those. Reasonably priced and fast service. Giving this place 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Pho was delicious, pretty big portion too. The shrimp rolls were tasty. Also we enjoyed the excellent service by the servers."}
{"text":"I travel to Montreal often on business and try to go to non trendy establishments to break the cycle of overpriced business dinners.  After reading Yelp reviews I decided to try this place. 

Being from DC, I have quite a pho palate and this place fails miserably. Let's start off with the good:
- the place has quick service.  You are in an out within 30 minutes. 
- the portions are large.  A medium size bowl is a large in some other places.  

Now onto the disappointment:
- cash only. It's expected in these types of restaurants but can be inconvenient for tourists. 
- the pho broth was greasy, a huge pet peeve of mine. The cuts of meat were also extremely fatty.  Some pieces were all fat.  Gross.  
- the broth was also very bland. I had to add a ton of hoisin and sriracha in order to get any type of flavor.  
- the summer rolls are bean sprouts, shredded lettuce, and slices of thin shrimp. The dipping sauce was watery.  

Overall I would not come back.  Pho is all about broth and a greasy, fatty, unflavored broth is a big no no."}
{"text":"TAKE OUT

This is my first visit in Montreal. The beef noodle soup broth didn't seem to have a lot of msg. It tasted like most of the vietnamese restaurants I've tried. There was a hand full of Vietnamese restaurants but this was the best option. This place got selected since it was the only one I notice that had customers eating. 

The soup in the a separate container was filled all the way up which was not good for putting stuff in when you don't have a separate bowl. They put the noodle and raw meat in one container and the broth in another so they seem to be aware of the noodles getting soggy."}
{"text":"My mother and I are big fans of grilled chicken pho and this is definitely our favourite spot in Chinatown. 

The broth is very flavourful, the vegetables are crisp-tender, and the chicken is mildly sweet and so tasty! 

They serve tea instead of water, which is a nice bonus. 

Service is quick and efficient, and prices are very reasonable. Cash only."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 15 years and this is my favourite pho in town period ! Make sure you grab spring rolls with the peanut sauce yum!!"}
{"text":"This seems to be a pretty popular place as it was pretty packed when I arrived.  However based on the reviews I expected so much more and it didn't really cut it for me.  The Pho was good but it wasn't great.  The portions are generous and the service was quite fast. Overall, that's why I gave this a 3 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best pho of my life... and in the middle of Montreal, of all places. Who knew? 

We walked in on a cold afternoon to warm up and nurse some pretty bitchin' hangovers. The menu was the same as any other pho restaurant, order by number. They brought out the typical plate of basil, lime and bean sprouts as we sat there shivering and sweating simultaneously. 

I don't know what kind of liquid crack they put in their pho, but it was seriously, deliriously tasty and full of flavor! We licked those large bowls clean and wanted to beg for more, had we not already been so stuffed and satisfied. 

My boyfriend and I have had a lot of pho in our lifetimes, from many different places, but this place trumps them all. From the outside, this place looks a bit run down and beaten up. Don't let this fool you. Their pho just might save your life."}
{"text":"I come here so often that the staff recognize me. One of the better pho broths I've had in Montreal"}
{"text":"Delicious pho! 

I liked that you could add vegetables for a small extra cost to the pho since I always feel like I'm carbo-loading when I eat so many noodles.

Our table was wobbling a bit but the server came to our rescue with wadded up cardboard to shove under one of the table legs. Love the resourcefulness! 

If you're paying with debit/credit, you have to pay at the front. 

Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Probably the best of the Viet places in Chinatown. Had the Bun Thit Nuong here and though the bun could be softer, the pork slices were cooked well. Will return to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"Great deal, caring service, and somewhat different soup in my pho experience. Delish thin rice noodles in perfection :D loved the temperature of my pho. Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Located through a basement entrance in Montreal's Chinatown, this is a solid pick I found with the help of helpers. I had the bun, which was quite good, but will be back to try their pho as well. I ordered the pork which was good and the imperial roll (which was extra and wasn't worth getting). The imperial roll wasn't particularly great and, at least in the San Francisco area, normally comes free. That said the overall price of $11.50 was a good deal for the amount of noodles and meat in the dish."}
{"text":"There were actually several pho restaurants around here, and since I only came to visit I'm not sure how good this place is compared to other pho places in the area. The place is not that clean to be frank, definitely clean your utensils, cups, etc. its also relatively small, around 15 tables? I actually like this place the most out of all pho places I've been to. I only ordered the rice dish which was really good, but the pho judging from what other people said at my table, the pho is good as well. Overall the food is great, just the place isn't as nice."}
{"text":"My favourite pho spot in Montreal.

They don't just add more noodles in the larger size, you get more meat. SO YUMMY."}
{"text":"Amazing. I've had pho like it's meant to be, according to my Vietnamese friend, in California, and this is just as good, at least to my tastebuds. I've looked for a place like this in New York, and I don't think there is one. My father had never had pho before, and he said he has a new favorite food.

The place even looks like it's supposed to, sort of cafeteria-style, almost. Portions are generous, and the price is pretty reasonable. Less than $10 for a bowl, several sizes available.

I had the chicken, and my father had the beef, and they were both great. We also tried the shrimp spring rolls (not the fried kind, the kind that's often called \"summer rolls\") and they were great as well. They used iceberg lettuce though, and it was a little wilted.

It's very casual. The tables have numbers, there are stacks of chopsticks and spoons on the table, and you pay at the front."}
{"text":"Out of all the pho restaurant I've been in Montreal, PhoBac is the best. The soup is always hot and boiling. They serve fast. Plus, for 10$, you get a big bowl of pho stuffed with meat(they give more portion than other restaurants)."}
{"text":"This place is the best place to eat in Chinatown. Every thing is amazingly fresh and taste great. Best pho soup ever and not to talk about the size of them. Service is great, fast and they are super friendly. The prices are awesome you can eat a LOT for very cheap.
Don't let the look of the place fool you because you will be missing out for sure
A MUST GO!!!"}
{"text":"Craving pho so checked this place out based on reviews and proximity. Pho was so-so. Meat looked questionable, even green under the light(!). I would give this place another try for some of their other dishes, but the pho is not the reason you should try this place."}
{"text":"Hmmm i expected more since reviews here were so good.....i don't think i'm coming back.
I went there around 16h on a Friday in November. The restaurant was little dark and not clean, I saw some little garbages on the floor and some tables weren't cleaned up even though place wasn't full. We 4 people, ordered a big chicken pho, a big beef pho ( both were huge enough to share with 2 ) and a spring rolls ( not fried ). Spring rolls were just ok. Really, nothing special nor impressive, you can make them just like that at home. 
Pho was good, but weren't that hot as I wanted to be and I wanted them to have more flavor or salt even, I felt that soup was lack of salt or some taste even though it had a nice flavor. And also I wanted more chicken in a chicken pho, even though beef pho had a good amount of beef. 
So, to sum It up, I guess i'm not coming back. If you try to make nice pho by yourself checking recipes online, you'll be able to make them just like them."}
{"text":"We tried to go to three of four different pho restaurants on St. Laurent but, for some reason, they were all closed or in the process of closing for the night.  Pho Bac was the only place opened, so we gave it a try.  

I guess they were closing soon too, as the entire restaurant smelled of bleach and cleaning products.  No matter - I was about to eat my first ever bowl of pho.  I can't compare it to anything else, but it was really delicious.  I overdid it on the chili sauce but I knew I couldn't let anything go to waste.  So, even though I was sweating profusely into my bowl, I finished it and had no regrets.  It took about 12 hours for my taste-buds to get back to normal after being destroyed by the chili sauce.  Again, no regrets."}
{"text":"Good pho! We ordered the beef ball one after finishing one dinner and the soup is good."}
{"text":"Utterly working-class eating house.  Was briskly greeted and presented with a pot of tea and a menu.  Menu is tiny.  Went with plain beef pho with extra veg.  

Soup arrived quickly.  The flavor was *brilliant*.  The noodles in it had the best texture of any Asian soup noodles I've ever eaten.  Only complaint about the soup was the scarcity of beef.

Choice of four sauces/condiments on the table, along with a rack of chopsticks and spoons, and an old school napkin-dispenser (wish more places would think of that), caused that I lacked for nothing logistics-wise.   Pleasant meal.

Restroom was a bit dirty, but fully-functional. Points for that. You're lucky to get a door that locks, in a lot of Chinatown's places.

This is a great place to quickly fuel up your gut with hot food that tastes wonderful.  Leave the Kiton blazer at home and just go in 501s and yesterday's grey hoodie.  And bring CASH.  That's all they'll take."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Pho Restaurant in Montreal by far.  I used to frequent this place as it had the best pho broth, bbq pork noodle bowls and fresh rolls in the city.  The place is located in the heart of China town along side a bunch of other pho restaurants, but this one is always booming with customers.

I usually order the special along side a plate of fresh shrimp rolls and it never disappoints.  The food comes out super quick and the steaming bowl of pho is always on point!  The give generous amounts of meat and other goodies including tendon, tripe, beef balls, etc. in their special and the extra large is definitely going to fill you up.  You can probably use the bowl to wash your face after, it's so large.

I always go here when I'm craving Vietnamese food in Montreal and the place can't be beat.  Customer service is also great and the people working here are a family unit that care about their food and customers.  Don't miss it, if you're in Chinatown Montreal!"}
{"text":"Nice big bowls of pho. Perfect for cold Montreal days. Tax is included in the menu price which was a nice surprise when the bill came."}
{"text":"Chased this place down on my first night in Montreal. REALLY, REALLY good pho for less than $10 - the soup base and the noodles were really ONE, as opposed to tasting like one has been added to the other like most pho do. Owner is super nice and gives great service. Did not disappoint. Recommend to those looking for good, easy, cheap comfort food on a cold damp night."}
{"text":"Huge portions, got a medium veggie pho and it was way too much food for one sitting. Imperial rolls were decent, but the winner is the cute little man greeting everyone and chatting from time to time. Also, the tea was a lovely little comfort on a rainy night."}
{"text":"Bland soup and not that hot when it was served, usually any pho soup is served very hot  and tasty because of the long hours of preparation of the broth but this one is bland and lacking in color and smell of real pho broth that we've tasted before."}
{"text":"Favourite pho place I've been to in Canada! XL size easily feeds 2 people. 

Broth is absolutely on point, not too much MSG but definitely heavy in rich oxtail and bone cartilage flavouring. Fresh cilantro and mints are always a plus.They always give good portions of meat!



Only downside is lack of debit/credit."}
{"text":"This pho hit the spot. Located in the center of Chinatown, it's a cheap little Vietnamese restaurant that offers pho and other Vietnamese dishes that you can find at other Vietnamese restaurants. Nothing fancy, fluorescent lights and kind of a bare bones service. 

We were seated right away and brought lovely jasmine tea like the kind that is served at Chinese restaurants. After looking over the menu, a man came by to take our orders without writing anything down. I ordered a medium pho, which ended up being a dollar cheaper than the small, but too much food for me to finish.

I also ordered a spring roll, which here, means the unfried rice paper roll filled with bean spouts, vermicelli noodles, the white parts of lettuce and shrimp. The peanut sauce that it was served with was good, but I've had better rolls. Oh and by the way, they're called \"summer rolls\" where I'm from if you're more familiar with that term. 

I asked a waiter (?) for water and he didn't even acknowledge me, but another man brought us waters.... we had to go up to the cash register to pay. If the service was better, this place would be better than a-ok, but for now, it's just 3 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Had the vegetable pho here. I'm not entirely sure if the broth was veg though, which I'll leave as a mystery. Regardless, it was a huge portion and VERY filling!"}
{"text":"Best pho in chinatown! Huge portions and delicious! Service is quick and the staff is super friendly! My one and only pho place in downtown!"}
{"text":"What a mean Bun Bo hue!

It was amazing! Served pipping hot, but so good you don't mind getting your mouth burnt.

We arrived at lunch and it was FULL so we decided to get a extra walk to let the crowd finish their dish and make some room as well as carving extra room in our belly.

The service was quick and efficient, the place look a bit run down. But you don't mind because your face will be in your bowl! 

The bun bo hue was phenomenal! If you can handle the spice, it's a must!"}
{"text":"We were traveling in Montreal and were craving pho given the snow and cold. Used other Yelp reviews to find this place, which is in the heart of Chinatown. It did not disappoint.

Nice staff and bring food quickly. The XL portion of the pho is actually EXTRA large! I had the veggie pho and my husband and daughter each had the beef ball pho. Delicious! Fresh ingredients and a great experience. Also, the prices were very fair given the huge portions! Make the trek and give it a try!"}
{"text":"There are easily 10 other Vietnamese restaurants on the same street, but this was one of the two places that had a line up on Saturday night. (The other place was pho bang New York) 

Service is quick. 

I ordered the basic regular pho. $8.50 for a small and was just the right portion for me. 

The soup base was good. But it still lacks some depth of flavors that I've had at other pho places. The noodles were spot on. And they are not stingy with the beef!!"}
{"text":"After hearing that Canada has a huge population of Vietnamese, the Vietnamese food must be amazing. I have had pho from many Viet restaurants, and somehow there is no clear distinction on what okay or great pho is since it all basically tastes the same. The only distinction would be the soup base. The soup base is very clear and refreshing, which I really liked. I am very used to pho that has full of flavor and it makes me thirsty after every few bites. - If you really enjoy your soup base to be very clear with just enough flavor, this is the place to go. It was not salty at all, compared to many other pho places I have had especially in NYC. 

The spring roll definitely differs from the ones in NYC, I'm not sure whether it is just the way this restaurant or Montreal Vietnamese restaurant makes it, but it simply tastes the same but with larger spring roll wrap. 

One downside is the ice coffee that I ordered was packed with ice and it was completely gone after a few sips. It is definitely disappointing when I can't even enjoy my meal with my coffee. 

I can totally see everybody that works there are very kind people despite the low attentive service."}
{"text":"Came to Montreal and this was the first place we went to. It was so good we came back again. It is very delicious but cash only!"}
{"text":"Traveling from Chicago, I would not compare this pho favorably to Pho 888 on Argyle street, but the broth is awesome, the price is cheap, and the (Medium) bowls are huge. My kid said the beef balls were too salty, and the amount of tendon and tripe in my soup was nominal. Cash only is a small inconvenience to me. I would eat here again, but I would rather try some others to see if I can find a 5 star option first. Wins, but without flourish."}
{"text":"Pho is good,but the place is not cleaned..good price,it's the best pho in Chinatown ,but it's not the best in montreal.."}
{"text":"One of the best pho ever had! Portions are huge and price very fair. Also the guy who served us was super kind. Atmosphere relaxed in a cozy place. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Attitudes not good.Service could've been  better. Waiter was not anxious to explain the menu. I do enjoy PHO and this was truly just average.my wife ordered the pork and shrimp and it contained only two shrimp. They only take cash. I ordered a spring roll and the waiter told me that they were out of them. 10 minutes later I saw them serving it to someone else. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was blah. This is the problem when you don't do any advanced research on restaurants before you go to a destination. Plus, when you ask people on the street for pho and they aren't Asian, they automatically send you to the local Chinatown. Oh well, lesson learnt. 

I looked up this place on the Yelp app on the crackberry. It came up and it looked okay. I actually was intrigued by Annie P.'s review on this place about the Asian party. We were hoping that the Asian gangster would give us four Asian brethren ideas on where the fun places were to go. But that didn't happen. Obviously the kind of party they were offering Annie P. isn't the kind of party we're invited to. 

The place is like any other standard Pho place. All of them have the standard white lacquer table and dinner chairs with the plasticy chopsticks and spoons sitting at the table. 

Ordered the Pho Dac Biet; the usual I get at any pho restaurant. The food came fast...standard. 

The soup was frickin hot, but unfortunately I can't say that the flavor was anything worthwhile. Was a little disappointed. We were craving some good pho after a few days of the gnarly rubbish the locals called food. We were hoping for an Asian saving grace in some local pho, but no joy. 

Well, it was filling and standard in price like $6 USD. It is in the heart of Chinatown (given that their Chinatown is like 2 square blocks). And of course China and Vietnam are the same.... right..... 

There were a couple places across the street that looked to be more popular by number of people in them, but they were all Caucasian with a couple Asians, so not sure if they were any good. 

My suggestion is to just find the one with the most or best looking Asian people and eat there. That way you'll at least get the pleasure of being with others with a similar taste profile and can maybe get that hookup to a nice Asian party in the area."}
{"text":"Good solid 4 stars.  Had the grilled chicken pho,  the broth of the meat pho way better tho.  Grilled chicken spring rolls were okay"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great pho in Montreal, this is the place. Excellent service and even better food!"}
{"text":"I eat Pho regularly and I thought this Pho was very flavorful. It was very light, not at all greasy, and had a lovely depth of flavor. Ambiance is lacking but prices and service are great."}
{"text":"I usually eat at pho Bang New York just crossed the street, but I tried the Pho Bac for the bun bo hue once and really preferred it better. This time I decided to try the regular assorted beef pho to compare with Bang. It turned out I liked this one better. First of all, the beef are very fresh. The one I get at Bang have some weird smells for the few times I went, their quality seems declined. At pho Bac, the broth is less greasier and I didn't feel thirsty after the meal. They probably used none or less msg. Speaking of the portion for an XL soup you pay only 11$ and they gave lots meat which is a bargain. I would come here more often to see if they maintain the same quality over the time."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awful.  I have a fairly high tolerance for most food, even terrible food, but this was gawdawful.  I always feel bad about not finishing my food because obviously, we're blessed to have food to eat, but I had to sacrifice my principles and stop eating.  

I find it funny that people think that just because a restaurant smells of BO, has a few authentic Vietnamese waiters and chefs, that the food is good.  Authentic maybe, but good?  No.  Please do yourself a favor and do not eat here.  Vietnamese food is amazing...this place, not so much."}
{"text":"When you've eaten multiple thousands of calories in poutine for lunch, sometimes you need liquid for dinner that has nothing to do with gravy.

The atmosphere was blah, but the food was tres yum. 

I tried the beef pho, a chicken curry and the spring rolls. The pho was served in huge portions, so unless your stomach is able to hold more than a gallon of soup I'd suggest sizing way down. The prices were reasonable. and the food was hot and good. The chicken curry was spicier (and therefore more delicious) than I'd first anticipated.

The spring rolls were disappointing for 2 reasons. The first being that they came out 30 seconds before the rest of the food, leaving us no time to eat them, and the second is that I really just didn't like the taste of these spring rolls and I can't put my finger on why. They were bland and just not what I wanted. What I wanted was a fried spring roll, and I didn't realize these weren't fried. They were also huge, each the size of a small burrito. 

The service was friendly and prompt and besides the spring rolls not showing up as an app, I had no problems. You have to go up to the counter to pay though, so don't wait around for a check at your table!"}
{"text":"After a weary long day of travel and walking between New York State and crossing the Canadian border, our tour bus of thirty five Americans worked up an appeitie for dinner. We came here after having a very bad taste of McDonald's for lunch. Vietnamese Pho is good comfort food as I enjoy noodle soup. The staff is somewhat attentive to our table but were mistakening give our table one combined check. My Mom and I were sitting with our tour bus group along with our guide which the waiter automatically assume we would get one combined bill.  Not! 

When we were finished with our meal I requested the check in Canto which the waiter instructed to go to the cashier (without any ticket or paper bill). Luckily the staff speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, English and of course French.  Multi-lingual opens doors indeed! 

Cash only as Pho Bac 97 does not accept credit cards in any format. They do accept American dollars with change in Canadian."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of pho, especially from toronto, so I came with high expectations according to reviews. Large portions, and cash only.
Got the first item on the menu, which was the mixed beef noodle. 
Meat was drab with no flavour. Didn't really taste fresh so I don't recommend the rare beef noodle. Broth wasn't extremely hot so I don't know if it all cooked down. The tripe was kinda meh as well. 
Good points though: Broth was authentic, and noodle texture was also on point.
Usually I get vermicelli at pho places so I might go again and try that? Vermicelli usually comes fully cooked and warm/cold so you don't have to worry about the issues found in the pho here.
Verdict: not a bad choice when you're craving pho but quality has lots of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Although I 100% trust Joke's tastebuds ..if you've had Prince Street, Flushing Pho Bac or Pho Bang in Emhurst.. Pho Bac 97 isn't as good in flavors or clean. Not to be a snotty brat but it only made sense that when us three Queens girls treck it over here to Montreal's Chinatown but only from St. Denis (no biggie) to try this place (all over the tour books) we weren't too impressed.

I believe the Sriracha and Fish sauce were in containers too... so no squirt bottle action.  

The decor made me feel like I was in a sad hardworking Alaskan family's restaurant. I can't imagine it in the Summer.

None of us got the vermicelli or rice plates but the only way I could explain it is that if those other spots I mentioned boiled their broth for 5+ hours then this place only did 2... 

So if you're far from this location .. I'm pretty sure any other Vietnamese place around town will be the same.
The servers were all friendly gangster men and one of the main guys even gave us his card in case we wanted to go to any \"asian parties\".. I believe his name was Chino or something close."}
{"text":"Decent pho and bbh. The pho was a bit salty but not bad. The bbh was a lot better than pho.

Spring rolls was bad.

Price was decent.

Service was ok. I asked 5x for water until I finally got it."}
{"text":"When you're in a new town and don't know where the good food is, just go to the busiest place. There's a reason it is so busy! 

As soon as you enter the delicious smell of the pho broth welcomes you in. R & I shared a pork  vermicelli roll and each had the pho was everything ( rare meat, tripe, ect... I think it's #5 if I'm not mistaken).

The vermicelli roll was really good I only wish they cut in half, but other than that very tasty. As for the pho it was blissful! It was raining that day so it tasted even better in the cold rainy weather. The broth was rich, the noodles were tasty and the amount of meat in it was more than enough. The medium size was a lot for me! like seriously so much meat and pho in general. We really loved it."}
{"text":"Authentic and awesome. 
Great rare beef pho. Add vegetables, it's worth it. Fast and easy, can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Living California all my life, I've had some good pho and Bun Bo hue (spicy beef noodles soup); therefore my expectation for this place wasn't too high before the foods came out. 
We ordered well done and rare pho and the BBH (spicy noodles soup) and to my surprise the pho broth was very tasty! The BBH bowl came out with the lemongrass and sate aroma! It is also spicy to my liking. 
The regular bowl is fairly large but if have a hefty appetite, the large will keep you full for a day! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Montreal needs a really good pho place because if this rated well it's pretty sad. Pho had no flavour and awful cuts if meat. Fresh rolls had no herbs or meat. They filled it with ice burg lettuce.  Just awful. I would not go back. The service was expected of a pho place.. we were seated near the washroom and received a dirty glass. Horrible"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho places. The food is cheap, wide selection on the menu and they give good portions. They also serve you hot tea, which is provided without additional charge. It's a good casual place to bring friends to sit around and eat, or to get a cheap bite to eat."}
{"text":"I came back for the pho and it was also delicious! Portions are enormous (even the small) and very filling. Broth was quite good too. I just wanted to add that the owners are very sweet and I will be back to support this local family establishment."}
{"text":"A cheap and quick place to eat in Chinatown! It definitely doesn't have a fancy restaurant ambience but there are families, people eating alone,etc.

I had #5 on the menu, which was a beef/tendon/tripe pho. It came really quick and was pretty good. 

I wouldn't be craving their pho all the time but if you are looking for a cheap giant bowl of pho, this is the place."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  My husband and i have been \"take out\" from here for the past year.  Always SO relish- and zero mistakes on our order. Always order the Pho Soup- w beef and an order of  spring rolls.  

We decided to stray this week and try recomended Pho Lein which had great reviews.  SUCH a disapointment. When we got home, unwrapped the beef to put into the soup - it was already pre cooked? UGH. The beef was fatty and tasteless. 

Pho Bac- great portion sizes, fresh taste, and delish! 
Be prepared w/ cash only and time to look for parking"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food! Their menu is more extensive than just Pho. While my friends all had pho I had vermicelli noodles with grilled pork which was delicious! I also really enjoyed their Vietnamese coffee. The owner was very friendly and always came to check on us. Reasonable prices and great service."}
{"text":"Standard quality pho. Have to flag down the waiters for everything including refill some water or drinks. Forgot a few of our items but got them immediately when flagged down 15 minutes later. Otherwise good food but wouldn't go there again. Took 20 minutes to bring 3 bowls of pho. Not sure but every other vietnamese restaurant, the pho is the easiest and quickest and comes out in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"After arriving in Montreal on one of the coldest days of 2017, driving through some harrowing traffic at rush hour, and discovering that our hotel was literally around the corner from Chinatown - my friend and I were thoroughly excited to go get some Pho!  

Based on the reviews on Yelp, I decided on Pho Bac because it was very close, had great reviews, and looked exactly like that hole-in-the-wall place that serves authentic fare without all the pretension.

And that's exactly what we got!  The perfect recipe for pho on a Friday night in Montreal.

We arrived just before 8, and the place was hopping.  I was afraid we wouldn't get a table, but a group cleared out just as we arrived, and we were able to get a table.  It was crowded... but it made for a great atmosphere.  I would venture to say that a lot of the customers were locals.  

I ordered Pho Ga as per my usual routine when at a Vietnamese place, and my friend ordered the vegetarian small soup.  She also ordered some fresh spring rolls.  Tea was complimentary.

My pho was the best chicken pho I'd ever tasted.  I'm being completely honest with this when I say the best.  The cuts of chicken were good.  A mix of mostly white meat and some dark pieces.  The meat wasn't overly fatty, but you could tell that the broth had been cooked with just enough fat to give it a distinct flavor without being greasy.  I loved it.  The mix of vegetables was minimal, some onion a spring of cilantro.... with the sprouts and thai basil and lime wedge, the flavor was perfect.  The temperature, too, was excellent.  Hot, but not too hot that I couldn't dig in right away. I ordered a medium and it was plenty big, my friend's small was probably the perfect portion size to be honest. 

Service was swift and polite. The food was great. Atmosphere was authentic. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Awesome pho. The Bun Cha Gio (vermicelli) was really good too. Poppin spot. Portions are HUGE. The medium is well enough for a grown man. This is OG Viet food."}
{"text":"Montreal is packed with fabulous restaurants, but this no frills spot on Rue St-Laurent in the red light district is one of the best.  Paradoxically, it is also one of the cheapest.  I have been coming here for over ten years now and fortunately nothing has changed.  Every time I visit I worry that it will either have closed or gone downhill, and every time it surpasses even my best memories. The food is incredible, the staff is extremely nice, and the price is right.

I always order combination B1, but with fresh shrimp spring rolls instead of imperial rolls (they are very accommodating here).  This combination includes strips of tender chicken sauteed with lemongrass and chili with sticky white rice, fresh shrimp spring rolls with two fantastic dipping sauces, and a spectacular Vietnamese beef and vermicelli soup.

Every one of these things is out of this world.  The lemongrass chicken is tender, succulent, and just a tad bit spicy.  This is served with crisp veggies and perfectly cooked sticky white rice that provides a nice antidote to the spice.  The shrimp spring rolls are fresh, flavourful, and  paired with both a sweet vinegary sauce with carrots and cabbage and a homemade sweet and crunchy peanut sauce so crazy good you'll want to dip everything into it.  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, the beef soup ('Tonkinoise' in French) is perhaps the most delicious thing of all: a generous portion of incredibly tender, wonderfully flavorful beef strips floating in a jaw-dropping lemongrass broth with crisp green onions, soft vermicelli noodles and fresh cilantro.

It isn't fancy, but Pho Bac is definitely worth making a special trip for."}
{"text":"on the second day of our visit over memorial day weekend, it was rainy.  though it wasn't cold, it was the perfect day for a bowl of pho!  
the place was somewhat small but it accommodated the weekend lunchtime crowd.  
service was friendly and fast.  i've never had a bad bowl of pho and this place didn't disappoint.  the broth was perfect and the ratio of meat to noodles was appropriate.  the eggrolls were good too!
i suppose that the true test of a restaurant is whether natives eat there and after seeing the number of vietnamese people patronizing this place, it's safe to say that pho bac is pretty good."}
{"text":"When I saw Pho Bac, I was expecting some Bac flavor.  The southern vs northern style of Pho is distinctly different.  In the USA, we generally only have the southern style, so whenever, we get a chance to eat the northern style we get excited.  When the bowl came out the flavor was just what we get in the USA.  Overall, it wasn't bad but nothing spectacular.  Service was fine and it is CASH only."}
{"text":"Self proclaimed Pho Enthusiast and this place would be my favourite for a downtown location. The pho here is definitely the best on the strip with good portion sizes. The spring rolls and imperial rills are also good- however I believe some of the other phos on the strip might be a little better in that regard. Also, the bun bo hue here is satisfactory but nothing I would order again ( something Montreal pho is lacking) . Anyhow, for Pho this is the spot you want to be at on Saint Laurent and within the dowtown, old port, chinatown, even plateau area for that matter... Once you head toward the mile end there are a few that can rival Pho Bac."}
{"text":"Was pretty delicious pho and at a good price. It pretty typical and standard pho. I dont have any complaints or compliments because it was just a typical pho experience. 

plus is this place stays open later than most."}
{"text":"The bouillon of beef noodle soup is not that hot to cook the rare beef and they are dirty how's the hell they gave a plate of bean sprout and Thai Basil for 3 people it's supposed one for each, crispy noodle is too salty for the sautee. I never come back at this place anymore"}
{"text":"As I was downtown I decided to stop in for a warm Pho or Bun (Vermicelli).  One this fine evening I ordered #3 the pork fried spring rolls with a #22 Chicken vermicelli.  The vermicelli came out just as expected with a huge whopping serving with a good mix of veg and meat!  The only thing it could have used more would be a bit more mint!  Delish knish!  Price is very inexpensive for the quality and amount!  Good thing I ate at 4:30 PM as I will need all night to digest!  :)"}
{"text":"Best pho I ever had, the rice rolls are so good and there are a lot of beefs in the Bun Bo Hue"}
{"text":"My sister was visiting and we were looking for a nice warm bowl of pho. The restaurant itself is nothing fancy, but the food was good. The medium bowl of pho was pretty large and I actually couldn't finish it, this was pretty unusual for me! I opted for the beef, tendons pho, there was an extremely generous portion of meat. 

The only downside was that the service took a bit longer than expected, but I can maybe attribute it to the busy-ness of the restaurant at that time."}
{"text":"When I saw it call PHO BC i really thought this spot is Viet northern cuisine which is hard to find in the East Coast and Canada, oh well I was wrong , same style Pho like any other restaurants in NY. Anyway, we order one Pho one Bun Bo. 

Pho is ok,  Bun Bo is surprisingly strong taste with shrimp paste. My man like it and I saw next table 3 Caucasian dudes seem to enjoy it too. 

One hightlight of the food here is how tender the meat in both dishes is. Super tender, great taste. 

Clean spot and funny staffs"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this pho place for years now, and the scene has changed a bit. It used to be all asian, but recently the customers have been extremely diverse. I guess this place is gaining popularity, and with good reason! It's a nice typical pho place with tasty broth and a good balance of noodles and meat. My go-to place in chinatown whenever my boyfriend and I are looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"My favorite pho in Montreal. Big portion and fresh basil with very good price. I always have number five medium, a mix of various beef parts. The portion is the best. The size is larger than the one in NDG area and Concordia area. The price is tax included. Only accept cash but have ATM. 
Love this place. Have been here more than 30 times."}
{"text":"Not bad. Just a little less impressive than Pho Bang for the area. Less busy place too, so if you want a more calm meal that is nearly as good, this is a great option. Very enjoyable. You won't find a lot of white people here, and that's a good thing.

Comfortable in French, English or Vietnamese.

If you can only go to one place, go to Pho Bang. if You can go to two, this is number 2 =)"}
{"text":"This place blows NYC Vietnamese food out of the water. Why pho can't have a renaissance here like ramen did I'll never know.

Came here on a Sunday morning for a noodle breakfast. Planned on ordering pho, but decided to switch to bun bo hue at the last minute. I like to live life on the edge, what can I say? Soup was fantastically spicy and flavorful, noodles were on point (none of that rice noodle BS), and there was plenty of beef. I'm pretty sure the waitstaff was talking about me, but I was in soup noodle bliss and just couldn't bring myself to care. Now bring this to New York and I'll be a happy camper...

Until next time, Montreal."}
{"text":"Tried the pho while visiting Montreal, was not disappointed. Smack center of China town and conveniently located. Ask for some sate sauce if you like it hot."}
{"text":"Sometimes you're just in need of fresh shrimp spring rolls with crushed peanuts on top of slightly sweet peanut dipping sauce. If you happen to be offered a pot of fragrant tea and a menu you may even order a bunch more. Since it was between meals, it was just the former 2.

Unfortunately, the rolls were below expectations and I've had my fair share of 4 and 5 star semi translucent wrapped Vietnamese spring rolls of the freshest kind. Sometimes the green onion is sticking out the end, sometimes they are thicker and more chock full of plump bean sprouts and the shrimp are moist and flavourful. 

In this case the bean sprouts were brown at the ends, the roll was shriveled and dry looking, plus sadly the shrimp were dry and had not been cleaned properly. 

Perhaps, it was between lunch and dinner and they had sat a while. Perhaps, I was too focused on them as my main snack, yet something said, 'nope, this ain't right'. I expressed these shortcomings, (did not mention the place smelling not so good), and was told that was normal. I mentioned my numerous other good experiences and decided to move right along.

I can see the average rating for this place is pretty decent, so I wonder if it was bad timing? I don't give many 2's, but for the spring rolls and smell under the table, this simply reflects that."}
{"text":"good food and fast service. I ordered vermicelle bowl with veggies, pork, chicken and an imperial roll, everything in it is flavourful even the carrot is pickled and tastes really good, except the rice noodle is a bit dry and has no flavour... But it'll be alright if u pour enough fish sauce&hot sauce on it!"}
{"text":"Good for a warm meal on an awful day.

Service was quick and my meal was hot and yummy! 

One downside about this place is that the least popular dishes/soups come out a bit lukewarm. I would recommend ordering something that is popular that way it comes out HOT! 

I'm surprised that the staff speaks four different languages! FOUR! French, English, Cantonese and Vietnamese! Amazing!

In a tourist area this place was fast and cheap! I would come again if I were around the area!"}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese and this is the best pho I've had in the western hemisphere, besides grandma's. This is not hyperbole. This pho is insanely delicious and I'm not just saying that because I came in from the cold craving soup.

The flavors are subtle and abundant. The tai meat is lean and the brisket is fatty, just like I like it. Ordered the extra large, and dear God is it big.

Also, loved the tea touch when I sat down. The new school pho places don't do that anymore. This place is legit. I will always come back here when I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"After trying all the most popular pho places in Montreal multiple more times I can finally concluded that this place is the best.

they have the greatest portions of noodles and meat, amazing broth, and very good prices. furthermore, their service and speed is better than the more popular place across the street, and there always room to eat. 

my go to pho place."}
{"text":"not very good. i grew up in diasporic asian communities, so i've eaten pho in all sorts of places. the noodles were cut and seemed low quality. also, rude service. the waiter laughed at me when i asked for no ice in my drink, and they also don't do substitutions even if it's simple (tripe for beef balls). also, the amount of food you get for an XL really isn't a lot, and i barely saw any tripe or tendon in my order, even though tripe and tendon were part of the order. the broth wasn't very good either, it seemed bland.

they take debit now, in addition to cash."}
{"text":"Service efficace et poli. Pour manger santé à bon prix, c'est l'endroit désigné. Ici, oubliez l'intimité, on vous assigne une place,,. Là où il y en a. Et c'est probablement ce qui fait le charme de l'endroit. Et puis pourquoi ne pas partager un espace avec des inconnus, le temps d'un repas? Ça n'a jamais tué personne."}
{"text":"Pho is the best I've had since Pho Pasteur in Arlington, TX and in Vietnam Nam. Broth cooked as it should be. Many flavors and lots of meat."}
{"text":"Pho was amazing in a rainy day in Montreal. This wasn't our first choice. We went to another pho spot on the same block. But that place was packed so we decided to come here. It's a really nice spot. Food and people here were amazing. One of the best pho I had, so good."}
{"text":"Wow, is this place ever packed during lunch hour. So avoid high traffic hours like lunch if you don't like the touching chairs or elbows with strangers crowd. Be ready to have a bit of a wait. It really seems as though they are constantly on their toes here to watch out for who is leaving - clear the table - seat someone quickly.

Tried to order the three bean rainbow drink but without eye contact or a glance they said they ran out. During lunch - they ran out.

Ordered the house special.
The soup base was a little watered down and lacked flavor for me but at least the food was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Excellent resto ! Service rapide! Abordable! Ne pas se fier au décor vous serez enchanté par leur soupe pho !"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, everything tasted authentic but the cold vermicelli was cold and the meat was cold. It was very disappointing. 

The broth on the other hand came out luke warm as well. 

The saving grace were the spring rolls but once again warm and not hot. 

I was hoping to get hot food but everything was either cold or warm."}
{"text":"Consistant as always noodles are awesome. If your going for decor this is not the place for you. More like a hole in the wall with great noodles. Service is your typical chinatown service which translates to nothing special. But the food is there and so is the Quantity. I once ordered thier large bowl of noodles and rolled outta there!!! Never again!! Stick to the medium as that too is huge."}
{"text":"I like the pho here. Next time I will order XL size and don't sit too close the door... it's windy!"}
{"text":"Went there early after a play at the TNM. Even if it was only 5:30 pm it was already pack with people. I had the fresh minced pork spring rolls which was good, not the best I had but good enough. The fish sauce served with it was great; well seasoned. I tried the Bo Bun, suggested by so many yelpers, it was my first time having that soup. The waiter told me they ran out of the noodles they usually put in Bo Bun but I had it anyway with regular rice noodles. Obviously I can't really compare the soup but I thought it was tasty and comforting. The broth was rich and just spicy enough. The meat was generous and tender. Quick and polite service, the place is clean enough, interesting menu at a cheap price; I'll be back If I'm in the hood."}
{"text":"Not to sound dramatic, but I think this is the restaurant I've been the most to in my life.
In saying that, I agree that the no-frills atmosphere and good food are consistent with these folks. Ingredients are fresh, portions are generous. So many empty bellies filled over the years; so many successful rendez-vous' here.
Really, there's no way for me to fully express my deep love for Pho Bac 97."}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant a few years ago for their pho soup and decided to go back since I was craving a good pho. I attempted to  be adventurous and try a different dish based on the image #1 posted on yelp which for sure was photoshopped and didn't exactly represent the dish.

I ordered #25 which is a beef vermicelli bowl with spring rolls and some lettuce and it came with a small soup as well. My friend ordered the same thing as I did but the chicken version. We were both happy with the soup but disappointed with the beef and chicken vermicelli bowl. It lacked color, taste and maybe the fact that I had a better version of this dish elsewhere makes me a tougher critique. 

Long story short they make a delicious beef pho soup and in my opinion this would be the best item on the menu to order. Stay away from their vermicelli bowl."}
{"text":"I have the number five the bowl. It was absolutely amazing the broth here was great. My husband has the number 25 pork chop chicken combo with rice and really enjoy that as well. The eggrolls need some work but still very good."}
{"text":"The Pho was delicious. We decided on the number 8 and added meatballs. The flavor was so good we are thinking about cooking back. We usually don't do that while on vacation...BUT this place was an exception. The tea was also great with the Pho. You won't be disappointed give them a try!"}
