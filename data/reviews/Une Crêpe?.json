{"text":"A good French restaurant that has good crepes.

However I experienced very bad service with the cook being very rude, if I really wanted the crepe, if I'm not going to change my decision. Another waitress had the same behavior. 

My recommendation : don't go ! Yes you will taste french cuisine but you will also get a very arrogant french service. There are other places worth of your money elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 crepes and a side from here via delivery. They arrived to me cold and with 2 items missing. One of the crepes was missing one of its ingredients as well. I ended up throwing 2 of them away after tasting them. The only one that was edible was the chocolate blueberry. All in all I paid 35 dollars for one cold somewhat edible crepe. I will not be ordering from them in the future."}
{"text":"I liked the casual but nice decor, and the food was excellent. Unfortunately, the service was terrible. There were only 3 tables, including ourselves. Instead of taking our order in a timely manner, the waitress chose to hang out behind the counter. After emptying the entire dishwasher and then chatting for a bit, she served food to another table and eventually made her way over to us. The food was prepared quickly and well, nothing but praise on that front :)"}
{"text":"This place has great sweet and savoury crepes.  They have many recommended combinations, but you can also pick out whichever toppings you would like.  Plan to have a leisurely meal, as this is not a place where you will be rushed out the door."}
{"text":"Our regular spot for Crepes in Montreal every time we visit. Pesto and nutella based ones are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice low key place. One of the few places that offer gluten free crepes (made from buckwheat flour) so I had to give it a try. The crepes (savory and sweet) were delicious. Had the ham and cheese, salmon and cheese and nutella with banana. All were great! The service was super slow but that's because they are understaffed. Only one girl serving/taking orders/cleaning tables etc and another girl doing crepes. I honestly felt bad for them because they were working super hard, running around and trying their best to serve everyone as soon as possible. So if you are expecting fast service don't go. If you dont mind waiting a bit for great crepes then its a go."}
{"text":"I visited my first day in Montreal, and wasn't disappointed at all! Really big portion of crepe, with top quality ingredients. The restaurant itself is lovely as well, and perfect for friends, family, or even just myself! 
They also play some jazz radio :)"}
{"text":"\"Bacon\" = pile of mushy strands of pork on a wet-greasy plate. Completely inedible.

I asked for eggs over hard. Our waitress spoke clear english so I can't blame a language barrier for the mistake... What I got was sunny side up. I sent them back with even clearer instructions to cook through... and got the exact same thing.

Then to top off the experience my eggs were plated with stale toast, an old bruised strawberry, and a slice of pineapple with a hair on it.

Never going back."}
{"text":"The savory are phenomenal. I had the Germaine and boyfriend had the Vedette with smoked salmon and dill sauce, and excellent combination. 

They had soy milk for my latte, which was great. The atmosphere is really laid back and cozy. It's a big location but it's nicely decorated. Service is good and the prices are reasonable. 

Would come back to try the sweet crepes next time."}
{"text":"Awesome crepes. I got the Parisenne, which consisted of ham, apple, and maple syrup. I can honestly say it was one of the best crepes I have ever had. Perfect balance of savory and sweet. In addition to the awesome food, the service was spectacular. Our waiter/host was very kind, and the man who I believe was the owner was nice as well. He stopped at every table and made sure we were enjoying our food. Every staff member went above and beyond typical duties, which made the restaurant that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Living in montreal, I've had different cravings ... First frozen yogurt, then some burgers and now one of my favorites.. Crepes

Walking on rue mont-royal we came across une crepes (425 avenue du mont royal est) we decided to give it a try ...

we were welcomed by a waitress in an amicable way , she was sick and had no voice but despite that she welcomed us with a wide smile ... After showing us to our table we were given the menus .. We did not take much time to order although every single option on the menu seemed tempting!
We started off with a crepe salé (spinach, ham and cheese ) it was a great combination, delicious and light. 
And for dessert we ordered the crepes nutella et meringues... No words can express how yummy it was ... 
I'd definitely want to go try other crepes on their menu."}
{"text":"Situé juste en face du metro Mt Royal, cette crêperie est aussi charmante que délicieuse. J'adore la crêpe bretonne avec jambon, fromage et un uf miroir dessus car elle est savoureuse, servie joliment avec une petite salade.
Le service est parfois un peu long mais comme j'y vais généralement le WE en pause magasinage, ca ne me dérange pas vraiment.
Les crêpes sont à un bon prix, la bretonne est a moins de 10$."}
{"text":"My crepe was a bit disappointing (the vege) a little dry but the flavour were good! It just needed some type of sauce to complete It. Unfortunately the service wasn't great when we went, just took way too long to get the check about 20-25 minutes on a not so busy day."}
{"text":"I don't consider myself a crepe connoisseur, but I enjoyed the savory crepe I had here. My husband and I decided to split one, and for a small fee they basically gave us two plates(with a crepe on each one and small salad), which didn't even seem like were splitting one! Our waitress was great. 

The only disappointment is that they don't have any vegetarian friendly soups! They had a carrot soup that I wanted to try, but it had chicken stock. =("}
{"text":"If you want to have real crepes in Montreal, then this is the place. You never go wrong whatever you order. It just gets tastier & better. Excellent service, cosy ambience & perfect location."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is really cute; there's a HUGE teddy bear at the back, and the wall is decorated with photos, plants, and mini terrariums of Totoro and UP House. Tres romantique! My boyfriend and I felt really cutesy that day.

He ordered the Mexican Crepe, and I ordered the German Crepe. His crepe contained guacamole, cheese, pepper, and egg, and mine contained chicken, mushrooms, and hollandaise sauce...but mine was particularly more delicious because the chicken itself was well seasoned! And the holliandaise sauce was a great combo to it all, so I was really happy with mine. 

I really liked that this place gives you an option between white flour, gluten free flour, or a mix of both, for no extra charge. So if you need a gluten free crepe, this is a nice place for it."}
{"text":"SOOOO delicious! This is right across the street from where we are moving this summer, and we will definitely be back (perhaps too often for our own good ;))

We were surprised to find the restaurant almost empty on a Sunday morning, but it worked out well as we only had 40 minutes to get in and out before visiting an apartment.

I don't typically like sweet things for breakfast, but all of the sweet crepe options looked delicious this particular morning. I enjoyed the strawberry, banana, and nutella crepe. It was the perfect amount of fresh and sweet! 

My husband had the special - a savory crepe with emmental, asparagus, chicken, and bechamel. The chicken had a really nice marinade on it.

Big crepes, and reasonable prices. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"I like it here a lot! Great crepes! Chill place, good for people watching. And there are so many choices to pick from. You can also create your own crepes, which is good cuz you may not necessarily like everything in the preset options. I liked their white and mixte crepes. 
Our waitress was very friendly. I find the prices are super cheap and then portions are generous :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for crepe of ur choice. Savory or sweet w diff types of batter. They have their house specialties as well as the flex to have u create ur own. Plus they have ample seating & plenty of teas to choose from. It's a cute spot right by the metro."}
{"text":"Mother of all creperies. Service is good too. Very fresh ingredients. Lots of choices. This place is crepe heaven"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes, love the build your own options. No wait for a seat. Service was friendly. I would go back."}
{"text":"The price is very good for the service and the food!! I ordered the one with pear and nutella and nuts. Very good!"}
{"text":"Yummy crepes both sweet and savory. Great cocktail menu and they serve big drinks so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Great Service, Great Breakfast and The juices are a must!"}
{"text":"My first going there and have a crepe. It was very delicious.The gluten free are made with buckwheat flour and are very airy. The waiters very friendly and understanding when I told them I was gluten free."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Our waiter was bilingual. Atmosphere was homey.

We went up to the bar to pay our bill."}
{"text":"I went there because of yelp comments.
I come from France and I'm extremely disappointed. 
Those \"crepes\" were disgusting. The sweet crepe wasn't cooked. The salty one had no butter and the garnish was really poor. The portions are really small compared to France.

It might be a good crepe for a foreign country but please, never ever again say that it is french. This is no french crepe at all. It gave me cancer."}
{"text":"It was delicious! Got the Pommière crepe and it was awesome just like their hot chocolate"}
{"text":"Fantastic and cheap!!! Got the make your own crepe with all sorts of add-ons. Great service and good food."}
{"text":"What a perfect ending to a nice night. My friend and I came here for dessert crepes, actually, we didn't plan on coming here, we happened to walk by and clearly we needed NEEDED to eat crepes, so that is what we did.

It was fairly later in the night, like after 9pm and it was completely empty, but also a weekday. The service was a little slower, but it was nice to be able to just enjoy the night with good company.

The crepes were delicious. I had one stuffed with dates, nutella and I believe walnuts, the thing was huge and delicious and about $8. My friend ordered a chocolate, ginger orange crepe which I was pleasantly surprised that they used REAL orange yum!"}
{"text":"proper sweet crepes in an epcot paris cafe sort of place. the crepe batter was spot on in terms of flavor, and it was cooked properly and had the right thickness. it was also a plus they didn't pound it with nutella like they do in the states."}
{"text":"The choice of sweet and salty crepes is really good. There is some French influence in the way the the fillings for the crepes are combined and prepared. Of course what is more French then crepe aux marron, which was worth tasting. Not impressed with my cappuccino, I guess I should have chosen the cider instead....."}
{"text":"The most amazing crepes that we have ever had!! To top it off, the sweetest girl that was our waitress made the dinner the best possible dinner experience."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!  I had the Mediterranean crepe and the Supreme hot chocolate.  Wow!! It was so delish!  The restaurant itself was cozy and reminded me of an Irish bar.  Please support this establishment and eat here!"}
{"text":"We only came upon this restaurant because our original plan for brunch was scrapped as a result of long line-ups, but boy, are we glad we did! Right as we walked through the door, the scent of cooking crepes was enough to make our mouths water, and we were seated right away. 

The menu had a large variety of different choices, including the option to build your own crepe. Being extremely bad at making decisions, I went with the crepe Pommiere (with apples, cinnamon, and  walnuts), and my boyfriend ordered a crepe salée with cheese, egg, mushroom and onion. 

I was thoroughly impressed with the one girl behind the counter making all those crepes hot and fresh to serve.  They tasted great - fresh ingredients, tasty fruit/salad on the side, and very filling! 

On top of that, the waitress was friendly and the restaurant was cozy and very nicely decorated. 

For a Plan B restaurant, I'd still give the experience an A!"}
{"text":"J'ai fais un arret inesperé ici mais j'ai aimé la tranquilité, la bouffe , l'odeur sucré et le service, tisane servie sur tasse reflechi ;)"}
{"text":"During our last trip to Montreal, we had our first meal at Une Crêpe.  It was a short walk from where we were staying.  Our group of 7 was seated by the gigantic Teddy Bear!!  Cool ambiance overall.  Service was good as well.

On to the most important topic.  The food!!  Of course, we all ordered crepes.  Everyone in our group was pleased with their choices.  Wish I remembered the names of what Wifey and I shared.  You can view my pics to see.  I can tell you that we shared one savory and one sweet crepe.  Each was delicious and fully satisfied our hunger.

Don't know if we will ever return, but I will say that they are a Nice place.  Check them out for yourself.  Bon Appetit!!"}
{"text":"They have crepes, hence the name.  Good crepes, a wide variety of crepes, and they have cider.  

We tried a variety of savory and sweet crepes and also tried the buckwheat crepes...all equally delicious.  The waitress was great, explaining everything to us.  

We tried to go back during our most recent visit but they were closed for the holidays.  We stood with our noses pressed against the glass looking forlorn at not getting to taste our favorite crepes again. alas!"}
{"text":"Tried the crepe with chestnut paste and whipped cream, and one with ham and cheese and bechamel sauce. Both were delicious - I wish I stayed near here so I could go back everyday! 

Hot chocolate was decent especially in the winter. I loved the slice of chocolate that came on the side."}
