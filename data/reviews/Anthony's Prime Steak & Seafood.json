{"text":"Fancy Schmanzy place to meet clients! Of course M Resort is beautiful ..convenient ...honestly don't think our steak was great...was aged type steak but turned out dry on medium ...disappointed ...all three of us  
So no photos sorry ..
On a more positive note...our chocolate Soufflé ..I mean , Chocolate Soufflé !!!! Yummm yummmm Perfecto!!!"}
{"text":"9/10 for me. Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and made the reservation over yelp, leaving a note that it was. Atmosphere was very cozy and romantic. Servers were very attentive and nice, immediately saying happy birthday. I got the bone in rib eye which was one of the best I've had, very tender and juicy. Also go the tots, which were good but not as amazing as I thought they would be. At the end of our meal we asked if they have chocolate covered strawberries and the waiter said he would go check, which we though was weird, then he came back a minute later with a plate with a candle on it saying they were bringing it out anyways. The strawberry shortcake topped the whole meal off. All in all, this place was amazing and had delicious food, wish I could try all the other steaks."}
{"text":"Amazing food with superb customer service! The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks ; he was able to answer all my questions and didn't rush at all.  

For appetizers, we went for the Shrimp Cocktail and Spicy Southwest Shrimp - which was my favorite!!! I could of had the Shrimp as a meal, it was that delicious! 

I ordered the Filet with a Loaded Baked Potato, and it was definitely LOADED lol. I loved it!! The meat was tender and had so much flavor, I didn't need any sauce. 

For dessert, I ordered the Milk Chocolate Soufflé, which took 10 mins to make, and well worth the wait. We also ordered the Sorbet - consisted of 3 flavors (Mango, Lemon 'Lemonade' and some sort of berry) with fresh strawberries and berries. Amazing. There was nothing left at the end lol. 

Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, great service, and beautiful ambiance. Wife wanted to have a nice dinner but didnt want to fight all the crowd on the strip so we decided on anthonys since it was literally down the street from the house. Glad we decided to valet our car cause anthonys was near the front entrance, so we didn't have to walk far at all . When we got to the place, we were able to be seated right away.
     For dinner we started by odering 2 glass of moscato, a dozen oyster and tater tots, wow it was hella good haha by the time our main food came I was feeling very tipsy lolz the moscato was sweet and very smooth. The wife ordered the rib eye and I order the the bone in filet OMG it was the best filet I had in a long time, it was sooo good that I had no leftover haha. We eat out at steak houses all the time but this was the first time I ever saw a bone in filet, so I knew I had to order it. Anthonys is easily one of my top five steak houses in vegas, so I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"So depressing here. I'm here for my wife birthdays , but service sucks and food still sucks. Sorry should've went to M buffet."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas, we dine here. I always get the lump crab roasted beet salad and the chilean sea bass.  Some times I will do a surf and turf and split the Signature prime bone-in ribeye and the sea bass with my husband. It's so good. Their Signature prime steaks are raised on the family farm. It's worth it to get the upgrade from the regular steaks they offer. Once in awhile they offer wagyu beef. If you call in advance, they can have caviar and all the accoutrements available. The service here is excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is always good and the service is intuitive, graceful, and proficient.  The lobster tacos are a must for a starter!  We also love pretty much any  fish they do.  If you are going to have steak ONLY order the selections from the Marnelle (sp??) ranch - the flavor is incredible!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite steak houses in Las Vegas. From the first glance the glass opening when you walk up and the decor and all together ambiance is fantastic. The hostesses were cheerful and got us seated immediately. We were greeted very quickly by our server Tony, who was absolutely phenomenal. He had an amazing personality and a great knowledge about the menu and helped us narrow down all of the amazing options that are offered on the menu to the perfect entrees that me and my husband loved. I ordered the filet, and my knife cut through it like butter. My husband ordered the prime rib and it was outstanding as well. This was one of the finest dining experiences I have had in a very long time. Thank you, Tony for your amazing service! If his section is open, I highly recommend requesting him as your server."}
{"text":"Please note that the prices here are not cheap, but I don't think you will be disappointed with the food if you are willing to splurge. :)

My husband and I have stayed at the M Resort a few times now, but this was our first time eating at this particular restaurant. Wow, we are so glad that we finally tried it!

We started off with the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer. We were surprised to hear our waiter say that it only comes with 3 shrimp (considering the price was $15), but at least they were JUMBO shrimp and the cocktail sauce was awesome. 

We were not sure which entrees to try, so we asked our waiter for his recommendations. He recommended the bone-in filet mignon. My husband asked him why he would recommend that over the regular filet mignon. He explained that the aging process for the bone-in version provided extra flavor that can't really compare to the boneless version. My husband ordered it  and it was cooked perfectly. It was huge and it  tasted SOOOO GOOD!! He was thrilled with it.

The other recommendation was the pan seared sea bass (sesame soy glazed with bok choy), so I ordered that. I was already considering it, so it was a no-brainer when our waiter recommended it, too. I was thrilled with my selection as well! It was nice and tender and light and just perfect. 

Even our side dishes were great! We ordered the grilled summer zucchini and the cheddar and onion scallop potatoes. My husband went nuts over them, so that says it all! He's not usually excited over vegetables, but he was pretty happy with the zucchini.  :) He also doesn't usually care for scallop potatoes, but he thought they were very tasty. 

We ended the evening with the chocolate souffle. It required about 15-20 minutes to make, but we decided to try it anyway. It was pretty good, but I honestly don't feel like it compared to the rest of our meal. I'm not saying it was bad...I'm just saying that we were more impressed by everything else. 

Overall, we really enjoyed the food and we were happy that we splurged for it!"}
{"text":"I enjoy dinner at the Oyster Bar at least two times a month. A few of my favorite dishes are the Seafood Salad and the Filet. The stuffed Tomatoes that come with the steak are to die for. To my surprise a few nights ago they had changes the wine menu. They no longer offered my favorite Pinot Noir by the glass. I have been drinking Holdridge by the glass for quite some time. Untried the new house Pinot and did not care for it. The Manager on duty gave the ok to open a bottle of my favorite wine to keep me happy. What a way to keep a loyal customer coming back."}
{"text":"I was really impressed!!  Service 5 stars.  The special Bison steak 5 stars.  The crab appetizer 5 stars.  In fact the presentation and preparation was like none I have ever seen the crab was just over the top.  This may sound strange but in our 13 day stay in June 2015 we had dinner there 3 times.  I am as old as dirt and that says something about this place!!"}
{"text":"Only reviewing happy hour....

Very tasty appetizers, good portions. French Onion soup is chronic. Nice TV's and a sportsbook close by for betting. Service is great. Ambiance is very modern and fits the rest of the M."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Anthony's from the service to the food and drinks everything is top notch here. I can't wait to dine here again.... The sangria is the best I've had in my life!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin.We had a reservation and walked up to the desk to check in when we looked over to the left at the bar the waiter was getting a glass of red wine and basically was smelly it with his entire nose in the glass. That was the first incident. We proceeded be seated in the back booth looking at the Chef's cooking everyone's food. We ordered the filet and New York steak one cesar salad and one chopped salad also scalloped potatoes. We received our salad my cesar salad had a sardine on the side with head chopped off of it  I couldn't believe it. The chopped salad was not appetizing either. The main course came the steaks and potatoes. The scalloped potatoes were soggy and watered down so bad I can't even explain like soup. Upon eating we seen the head chef eating and not but rinsing his hands not washing then another cook back behind the line eating also. So we complained to our waiter that we seen maybe twice and he already knew about the potatoes and he took them off the bill. We finished our meal and asked for the check and he brought it and stood there and waited for the money! Who does that! Not impressed would not eat there again."}
{"text":"Top notch food and service -- love the steak and soup. Also the free bread is delish and the atmosphere is perfect quiet and conformance"}
{"text":"Had gf birthday dinner here and was very enjoyable.  Prices were fair and the steaks were delicious.  Service was solid, not extraordinary not bad by any means.  Very nice quite atmosphere and will be back."}
{"text":"This dinning experience was amazing. You would have never guessed to have this top notch experience from a restaurant located in a casino resort.

Food was amazing and the staff was very attentive. Thank you to our server Florin, Bruno and Brain and the other staff members for the great service!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant, friendly staff, we dine a least once a week, best well dressed manager,  friendly he makes you feel your dining at his home. Ask for him when your there his name is frank, keep up the great work you all do"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was good, and the steaks were great, but the sides (mashed potatoes, broccoli) and dessert were just okay. We waited for about 30 minutes for a table, having no reservation on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"My family and friends also ended up at APSS during Thanksgiving dinner because Studio B was overcrowded.  My experience was better than one other yelper who also spent TG at APSS.  

Great experience!  We didn't have any reservations but we were seated immediately.  Nobody in my party took advantage of the $45pp Thanksgiving menu.  I ordered the bone in ribeye cooked medium.  It was superlicious!!!!!  Superb steak!  Our waiter was very attentive and our glasses were always filled to the rim.  Excellent service.  Desset was amazing and well presented.  It was a perfect evening.  The wasn't so nice was the $700 bill.   :("}
{"text":"When it comes to the food, this place doesn't disappoint, I ordered their elk dish and I have to say that it was cooked perfectly and tasted great, the only bad thing is the price , if you want to take one other person besides yourself, plan on spending over $100. Otherwise the service was good and the staff were helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"A rare date night out with my wife. My wife had a taste for crab legs. We conducted a search close to our home by Southern Highlands and decided to give Anthony's a try. The Alaskan crab legs did not disappoint nor so did the oscar filet but from the start the service struck me in a bad way. Hostess were in a personal conversation before we were acknowledged,  it took a very long time after we were seated to get our menu and our server was very disappointing. We did not have the service I expect when you go out and spend several hundred for dinner for two. My wife noticed that the table in front of us was frequently looking for the same server's attention. I side tipped our busser for trying to make up for the bad service we were receiving from our server. I did not want to complain to the manager and ruin our rare date night out but we will take our craving for crab legs elsewhere...."}
{"text":"Good food, slow service (but worth it). 

My entire family had a dinner here, and several people in our group stated \"this is the best _____ I've ever had\" about their dish. And they weren't even drunk. The food is fantastic, just don't come here if you're starving, because the food takes a while to come out.

A side note: If you want to play a drinking game, don't do it here, because that sh*t will get expensive and they have slick floors!"}
{"text":"Our favorite steakhouse in Vegas! We go here at least once a week, yes, it is that good!The staff is amazing! Bruno is like family to us. The steaks, crab legs and all the seafood must be tried. Big appetite? Then try the LARGE Lobster tail. They don't have it everyday but if you let them know ahead they will have it. Sides are all good too. Desserts? Favorites are Doughnuts, Peanut Butter Pie and Chocolate Lava Cake. This ensemble of amazing people make your dinner one to remember each time!"}
{"text":"Marvelous Dining Experience 

I am writing this review as a very satisfied consumer after having the opportunity to have one of the finest dining experiences I have had in the last decade. There were 5 of us in our party with 3 of us being in the hospitality industry and all 5 of us being well traveled. 

We were able to book a last minute reservation for Anthony's after hearing some great things about the quality of food and service. We ventured away from our hotel on the strip despite there being an abundance of steakhouses to choose from and we are beyond happy that we made the short trek to the M Resort. I'm not going to go into detail about the resort because our time there was limited to the dinner, but I will say that the common areas were clean and well appointed. 

Upon our arrival we were greeted promptly and warmly by the host and asked if we had reservations. We of course had made reservations and I'm very glad that we did, the dining room was busy but there was a very professional and relaxed pace amongst the service staff.  From what I could see there isn't a bad seat in the entire dining room with ample space between the tables for intimate dining and a great view of the show kitchen. 

We brought a special bottle of wine with us to celebrate the 30th wedding anniversary of our parents and Edward did an impeccable job of decanting it. We ordered a fantastic Perrier Jouet 2004 vintage to toast to while the 1992 Lafite Rothschild had some time to breath. The menu had all of the traditional steakhouse fare that you would expect as well as an extensive wine list. 

I won't bore you any further with details on our specific dishes, but I will tell you that the quality of the ingredients used and the technique of the kitchen and service staff were definitely on point. The simplicity of the dishes left zero room for error and I can honestly state there was a flawless execution to our entire experience. 

This restaurant is highly recommended, send our regards to Edward, Frank and JR when you go in for your marvelous dining experience."}
{"text":"A beautiful restaurant with a great view. The steaks were awesome. Loved the tater tots. Our waiter, Bill, was wonderful."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  A little pricy, but well worth it for a special occaision. 

We love the bread, and all the steaks, but the best steak on the menu is the bone in tenderloin! 

Sides are big enough to share, and cream spinach and Mac and cheese is delicious!"}
{"text":"Well worth the trip!

Everthing was awesome. Steaks melted in your mouth and I could almost cut it without a knife. Everthing about the experience was spot on. Service, quality and it all seemed genuine. Happy people happy to be there for you and in my humble opinion, the best steakhouse ion town."}
{"text":"Anthony's has the best steak in town and it's worth the trip to the south edge of town. Their Prime bone-in filet, from the Marnell family ranch, is not to be missed. Always perfectly prepared and fork tender. Oh my! The chef there (sorry to say I don't know his/her name) is incredibly talented. If you hear a special that sounds interesting, go for it, it's likely very good. We love their chopped salad: tons of fresh veggies and not over-dressed. And the service is always outstanding - friendly and warm without being intrusive. The entire property, and this restaurant in particular, is gorgeous. The view after the sun goes down is fantastic. But it's the food you'll come back for.  It's a locals secret (which I guess I just let out of the bag)."}
{"text":"We came here for date night & had an awesome experience. We got the beets & jumbo lump crab salad & a Caesar salad. For our main entree we got the filet & Seabass combination with sweet potatoes & asparagus as side dishes. Overall we were satisfied! We didn't get desserts because we were pretty full. Awesome atmosphere, really private & quiet."}
{"text":"I have dined at Anthony's on several occasions and each time my service and food was excellent.  I live here in Las Vegas and have dined at many fine steakhouses and Anthony's does not disappoint. I have had the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection, the Lobster very succulent, Alaskan King crab perfect creamed spinach, creamy mashed potatoes, tator tots all prepared wonderfully. I highly recommend this establishment. I have never been dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Bone-in filet and porterhouse were amazing. You could cut the filet with a butter knife.  Definitely recommend Anthony's for a delicious steak experience."}
{"text":"Amazing! I had my first porterhouse here, and it was amazing, Amazing, AMAZING! We also had the bacon wrapped dates, prime rib, filet mignon, a few deserts, and lots of wine. Everything we had was amazing! The staff was very knowledgable and accommodating with my elderly father who was in a wheelchair. As this place is fine dining, it it not inexpensive, but it is worth every penny! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Second time here.  I highly recommend anyone willing to drive off strip or downtown, quick 20 minute drive and you will have the best steak.  Had the dry aged, bone-in filet... big, tender and tasty.  Also ordered oysters... delicious.  Heard about their crab legs and will be back!"}
{"text":"We had a really nice dining experience here. Our waiter, Bruno, was really cool and gave us great service. I like how this place doesn't have an uptight, snooty vibe but it's still nice enough to enjoy on a special occasion, like an anniversary...which is why we came. The large outdoor patio overlooking the pool was such a neat surprise! It was beautiful out there. We relocated to the patio to enjoy our chocolate soufflé and they happily let us do so. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the shrimp Louis salad with lobster was presented beautifully and was delicious as well! I also recommend the scallop potatoes. Ooh...and the bottles of wine were affordable! As low as $35/bottle. We ordered a $45 bottle of Pinot Noir and it was nice."}
{"text":"Anthony's also has an Oyster bar that is often missed by people.  It's a great place.  Must try is the Surf and Turf Sushi.  My personal favorite is the gumbo."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Derrick was our waiter. Nice guy...great service. My sea bass was perfectly cooked. The texture was like butter. My only complaint was I wish the cut was a little bigger. My husband ordered the surf and turf. And I was given a complimentary birthday dessert. Everything we ate was delicious. We'll definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"If you come here, you must order the tomato mozzarella salad! Hands down one of the best tomato mozzarella salad I've ever had! I was expecting something small, but the salad was huge! And they use the sweetest heirloom tomatoes, definitely worth every penny! I also had the salmon, which is cooked perfectly. It had a great sear on the outside and tender inside. 

The ambience is great here and they have a huge outdoor deck with nice views."}
{"text":"Best steak in Vegas! Edward is the best waiter! And Florio! Tell them karen & tony sent u!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were delicious. The service was also great. All of our waiters were very attentive to all of our needs. We started off the night off with some drinks. If you like a strong drink/cocktail then I would highly recommend the Mexican Peach. However, my favorite cocktail was their coconut martini. 

For my entree I had the prime bone-in filet. It was soft and very tender. My only complaint is that the meat did not have much flavor. I also ordered the macaroni and cheese, which was incredibly chessy and flavorful. For dessert I ordered the creme brulee and 3 trio gelato. The creme brulee was delicious and its comes covered with a sugar shaped dome, which was beautiful. The only gelato that I enjoyed was the mango. The other flavors were a little too tart for my liking."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time last night. It was fantastic!! We were so pleased with our meals. 

The cocktails were fantastic! Kudos to the bartender. We started off with calamari and oysters rockefeller. Both were delicious!!! The calamari was so fresh and tender. The oysters had great flavor with spinach and cheese. My son had French fries and we ate more of the fries than he did, lol. They were freshly cut with great seasoning. 

We shared a bone in rib eye steak. Let me tell you....this was one of the best steaks I ever had. Excellent flavor, super tender, just plain delicious. We walked (or rolled) outta there so satisfied.

It was a bit busy. The only negative comment I would have is that we waited for the waiter a bit longer than we would have liked. He must have been really busy because it took him a while to get back with us. Luckily the food made up for it. However, the waiters and runners were very friendly! The decor in there is super sheik. I love it! 

We will definitely be back for sure! We just live not too far away so it's great that it's so close to us."}
{"text":"Chopped Salad, no tomato.  
Fig & Peach Salad w/ Arugula & Cheese.
Chilled Crab w/ the tasty Dijonaise.
Ahi Tuna Stack, delish & fresh avocado!
Any Seabass dish w/ Scallops or Shrimp on top & YAMs!

Please bring back the SW Shrimp!!  If so add an extra corn bread too please mmm!  

The Short Ribs fall right off the bones & the yams are better than dessert.  I love the bartenders Whitney, Ray & Carl.  Great wine list, HH & soon to be Football seasons, where it's fun to sit at the bar!  Park in valet or on the side closest to the freeway so you can walk right up."}
{"text":"I feel pretty darn lucky to consider Anthony's Prime Steak and Seafood as one of those \"it's just down the street\" type of places. I live in Anthem behind the M Casino so any great place within a 15 min drive from my pad is heaven. I like knowing there is a fine dining establishment close by and not have to drive all the way to the strip for. 

After we arrived, we were seated promptly as it was not busy. Plus I made opentable reservations because I like the points. The ambience is hip and sophisticated, the service is uber attentive. In this place you never feel unpopular because the staff pays a lot of attention to you. 

We decided to skip entrees and order three appetizers, it was that kind of night. On our table was placed crab cakes, oysters Rockefeller and the Foie Gras. The presentation of all three were post card worthy... Hail the food art that was presented before us! The crab cakes were crispy and moist, the crab was fresh. The toppings of various vegetation that decorated the crab cakes were a fine compliment since it added texture and palate changes.

As for the oysters Rockafeller... Wow... Super fresh oysters. The oysters were large, perfectly cooked with a topping of spinach mix and hollandaise sauce. The oysters were presented on a plate of rock salt, a happy place for salt lickers! I highly recommend this appetizer.

Now the Foie Gras is pretty darn good.  I love ordering foie gras because different restaurants create various interpretations of this beloved ingredient. At Anthony's, it is seared and served with thick toasted bread. I really appreciated the thick bread because in all honesty... There was enough bread for the foie gras! Awesome!!

We also ordered the frozen peanut butter pie for dessert. Ummmm wow. This is definitely a shared dessert because what you get is a MASSIVE slice of frozen peanut butter pie on a chocolate cookie type crust and topped with nuts and chocolate. Super amazing!

I am looking forward to visiting this \"it's just down the street\" restaurant, again."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for our anniversary and we had an amazing dinner. I highly recommend the green beans, calamari and tater tots as a side. The tater tots were so cheesy and full of flavor; best tater tots EVER! Our steaks were both cooked to perfection and the flavor was outstanding. If you're looking for outstanding flavor, give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary and hubbys bday. I'm a steak person and this place is better than Mortons and Ruth's Chris. The view at the M was awesome"}
{"text":"We went to our favorite place again last evening for my birthday. The food is so delicious. The Lobster Bisque and the Wedge Salad is quite yummy. My husband always gets the Prime Rib, as he agrees Anthony's is certainly the best place in Las Vegas for this dish. 
The atmosphere is very relaxing and serene. We sat outside again and the view is great. The view overlooks the pool and you can see parts of the strip from where we sat. Our waiter, Fabio was great as usual and our busser from Hawaii was so warm and friendly. The hostess's always greet you with nice, welcoming smiles and accommodate your needs. 
This is by far, our very favorite place to dine in Las Vegas. We love and enjoy going here and think the food is amazing, the service is great and the dining experience continually leaves us happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"WOWZA! WOWZA!! WOWZA!!! Quite an INCREDIABLE happy hour~ 
  Daily 5-7 half price apps of the menu placed on the table, NOT the dinner menu but we had the oversized Tater Tots, creamy, potato-y goodness, shrimp cocktail beautiful jumbo \"CLEANED shrimp & beautifully presented w/ really good cocktail sauce, mushroom ravioli rich savory deliciousness, Mac n Cheese I know you can get this anywhere these days, but not like this one.........again creamy, smooth better than Mom's!!!! Atleast my Mom's~ and finally the French Onion Soup, again just pure deliciousness .
    Wine is 1/3 RS off per bottle and one of the BESTEST MANAHATTENS I've EVER CONSUMED 
   I am telling Ya~ Get over to the M & Antony's Steak, NOT BURGERS and enjoy a wonderful atmosphere in the bar area, FAB service YOU CANT GO WRONG!!!!!"}
{"text":"Celebrated dinner here last night for Christmas Eve.  The service was top notch.  We had filet, bone in rib eye and the sea bass. For dessert the chocolate banana tower.  Not much of a tower.  Our meal was ok but not the best I've ever had.  We were seated immediately with a reservation and like I said the service was great!  Not sure I would eat here again.  Nothing really stood out for us!  There are other steakhouses out there that are much better!"}
{"text":"Awesome... Food, service, prosciutto salad, and the steaks are on par with any of the high end steakhouses in town. We've eaten here several times and it is consistently excellent."}
{"text":"I have walked by this place so many times that when my friend asked me to join her for dinner, I was looking forward to finally trying it. I would say this is another place that isn't too memorable. We didn't have a reservation and were seated right away. We went around 6pm during the week and we were the only ones on the side of the restaurant. I thought that was a little odd and maybe not a good sign. This is a large restaurant so maybe it just doesn't fill up.

I ordered a filet and shrimp. The shrimp were pretty amazing! I love shrimp and do not like when the have that fish/shrimp taste. The steak of overcooked, so I didn't like it. I always order my steak medium and I find if it is overcooked, it loses flavor. Since my friend's meal was fine, I didn't want to send mine back.

The service was okay. The waiter wasn't too friendly but he stayed on top of refills and checking in on us. At the time, I thought maybe he was in a bad mood because they were so slow! One thing I liked was, after the sun started to go down, they opened the blinds, to give you a view. 

With so many steakhouses in town, you really have to stand out. Not only does the atmosphere or service not stand out in my mind but the food wasn't great."}
{"text":"Try the Prime Choice bone in filet mignon. Very intimate atmosphere with dim lighting. We decided to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner while vacationing in Vegas and were more than pleased with the amazing experience. Will return."}
{"text":"hi, went to anthonys last thurs. night with a party of seven. We were celebrating an anniversary , we all dressed up to the nines ! ! wanted to have a fun nite out ! 
the food is good, very high end .  2 of us ordered the prime rib, 2 others ordered filet, 3 others steak, plus apps of sashimi, tator tots, mashed potatoes, 
spinach, lobster bisques for all, they do charge extra for everything... so watch out,
we sat outside it is a nice view..... now the bad part... our waiter, Fabio. I don't like to be disrespectful to our food servers here in Vegas cuz they do work hard, but Fabio is
very rude, rushed us during our ordering, did not want to explain the specials after my uncle asked a question, he said he did not know, did not bring our drinks until after our dinner was served by someone else, he was very rude when we asked for another martini and never brought it. he also did not bring water until we asked four times cuz we passed on the bubbles water, he also tried to take out plates before we were done ! the place was empty, three times he wanted to take my plate with food on it ...jeeeez..... Anthonys please he needs more training on how to treat customers :("}
{"text":"Amazing dinner and service! Frank the GM and Fabio our server are two seasoned vets. Bison filet with port wine reduction and bone in rib-eye cooked perfectly. Creme brûlée presentation 5 star"}
{"text":"Service won me over at Anthony's.

Yes, the food was good.  The descent variety of aged steaks and seafood options were nice, and you can even go over to the kitchen to watch the food be cooked on the grills.  The variety of sides (tater tots with bacon and cheese? Yes please) was also nice.  The food was very nice overall, with a variety of steak sauces ready to server.

But the service was spectacular.  Not too pushy, very kind, patient, and you knew the staff wanted to make you happy, not just wait on you.

If you're at the M and want a steak, you can't go wrong at Anthony's."}
{"text":"Ahhh... so good.

We came here on Christmas because we were staying at the resort for the night. The Studio B buffet's wait time for the night was at 3 hours when we called at 5:15pm. So we decided to see if we would be able to get a table at one of the restaurants on property. 

Called down and made reservations at Anthony's Prime Steak & Seafood for 6:15pm. This is somewhat of an accomplishment seeing at ANYTHING on the strip would have been fully commited for the evening already. (see my other review on the M Resort Hotel)

We came down and waited maybe 5 minutes for a table. We were seated in a quiet corner by the back window. Edward was our server and his assistant (didn't catch her name) brought us bread and butter while we looked at the menus.

We ended up ordering the Prime Filet Carpaccio as our appetizer (sorry no picture, was too hungry and ate before I could remember, oops). Mache Salad, with shaved Parmesan and mustard dressing. We had a little bit of salt and pepper added as well. And, let me just say it was wonderful. There wasn't an overpowering flavor from the mustard dressing and the salt and pepper helped bring out the flavors. 

For our entrees my boyfriend order the Porterhouse $52 (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=j1hCLhSsUTtA0KlZc0-SoA&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw) and I had the New York Sirloin $38 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anthonys-prime-steak-and-seafood-henderson?select=nUAkbmot4qS5bbvKnheLrQ#AjsCFXsZhJfvEj8BOx742A). We had them cooked to medium. These were some of the BEST steaks I've ever had. They melt in your mouth... (I'm drooling just thinking about it) They were perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend had asked about the sauces out of curiousity and Edward told us that we really don't them - and, he was right. 

Both steaks came with a little grilled onion, stuffed tomato and a tiny salad. We ordered two sides the Asparagus and the Mashed Potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anthonys-prime-steak-and-seafood-henderson?select=nUAkbmot4qS5bbvKnheLrQ#MN4Viu96g2YAhywjbGhF-A) and both were great! 

Had Creme Brulee (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anthonys-prime-steak-and-seafood-henderson?select=nUAkbmot4qS5bbvKnheLrQ#nUAkbmot4qS5bbvKnheLrQ) for dessert and that was alright, not the best I've had but still really good.

Anthony's. 5 Stars. Done."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and based on the yelp reviews had somewhat high expectations but somewhat let down. 

We had dinner reservations for 730. I asked for a booth seating unfortunately there weren't any available. They sat us by the window where you can see the meat getting cooked on the grill. For some reason I felt like that area wasn't really \"inside\" the restaurant although I know it was.

There was more seating passed this area and from our seats it looked like there could possibly be an outside view, but we didn't really get to see what that area looked like from where we were seated. 

They started us off with a bread basket with butter that had olive oil.  Good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  For our meals, I orders the wagyu short rib and my boyfriend ordered the 20 oz bone in rib eye. The menu said we had a choice of 3 sauces (bernaise, peppercorn, boredelaise) for the ribeye. However our waiter failed to ask us what he wanted. I only remembered about 20 mins after the order and asked our waiter about it. We also ordered a side of wild mushrooms. 

I felt like the wait for our food was a little too long. It didn't seem that busy inside the area where we were seated but who knows what it looked like on the other side. 

We finally got our food from what seemed like a 30 minute wait. Both portions were huge!  However both the steak and short ribs just tasted ok. I felt like I've had better. The peppercorn sauce didn't do anything for me  My boyfriend felt the same way. 

I don't think our waiter was attentive enough. They did remember I had mentioned on the reservation it was my boyfriend's birthday so they brought out a complimentary dessert (see pic).  However it kind of irked me there was no \"Happy Birthday\" message on the dessert (as I've seen in other pics). I know, not a big deal, but those attention to detail, special touches is what makes the visit memorable. 

Overall, for a pricey steak restaurant, the service was somewhat lacking. They didn't come back to follow up if we wanted cocktails until the middle of our dinner, the waiter forgot an essential part of the steak order, and he didn't check up on us much. We got more attention from the busboy.

I don't think I'd come back here again if I'm in the mood to spend my money on an expensive meal. I don't know if I can recommend this place either.  There's definitely other steakhouses out there that are worth the money."}
{"text":"This place was INCREDIBLE. It is located inside of the M Resort and I do believe it used to be called something else as I recall eating here once before. The service was beyond any expectation. Our server was accommodating, knowledgable, and extremely pleasant without being overbearing. The staff was all around great -- our drinks never reached the halfway point before being refilled. The food was great. I had the sea bass which is probably the best piece of fish I have ever eaten. It encompassed everything a good piece of fish is suppose to taste like. We had a few sides which were all great, and other two people in my party had prime rib and steak which they were all delighted with. The total bill for all 3 was somewhere around $120...money well spent for the extraordinary food and service."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the best steaks in town. They serve 22-24 oz. rib eyes and porterhouse steaks that just makes you want to visit this place whenever you are in town. The  sides they serve are just as fantastic. Their mac and cheese along with their cream spinach will guarantee your return. This place is a must stop if you are visiting the the M resort and casino."}
{"text":"If you are in the on the south side of the town and want to avoid the strip for good food then you look no further for a classy steakhouse. I came here for the Christmas Day dinner with my girlfriend and her mom. They are pretty busy on Christmas, so reserve a table couple days in advance. Once we checked in we were seated promptly.

The service was ok and that's probably due to holiday rush and lack of servers during for taking their time off. I ordered the lobster bisque for starters. It was very delicious and rich. However, it was bit more salty then how I usually prefer. The lobster pieces were in good amount and the meat was tender.

The main entree consisted of 24Oz porterhouse (med-rare), Bordeaux, asparagus, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and three different dipping sauces for the steak. The steak was bit on the rare side for my taste, but the seasoning was pretty good, the peppercorn steak sauce was also delicious. All the sided were perfect compliment to the steak and the wine was exquisite. 

This is a good location for a nice family or a company dinner Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Update as of March 2016: We had been told that there were major changes in the restaurant since the last time we were here. Apparently the bottom line was not doing well and there were changes in personnel. They also cut back the number of servers and it appears they also changed the prices. The biggest change that we noticed was in the service. We were in the restaurant for an hour and a half. We did get our salad after considerable amount of time. They never did manage to get to bring out our shrimp cocktail before we had to leave. Our server was very apologetic. However, the restaurant now being shortstaffed should not be my problem. Our water glasses were never refilled. We asked for a refill on the bread. It never came. Even trying to get the bill required that I ambush a food runner going to another table and telling him we were leaving and needed to have a check immediately. The price was also quite different than the last time we were here. The wedge salad alone was priced at $17.50. While it was quite good, it was not a $17.50 good salad! Not exactly a bargain, especially for a happy hour sitting in the bar. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The staff was wonderful.  The promptness and friendliness of the service was the best part of my evening.  However, for the price we paid, the food was not worth it.  I got the lobster risotto special and I was very disappointed. The company i was with loved the steak, but I was very disappointed in my meel"}
{"text":"Half off appetizers during happy hour 5 PM to 7 PM come check it out.  The staff is very polite kind and friendly. The food is delicious overall it was an excellent experience. Met some new friends here.. BON, WHITNEY, and JOE. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great dinner last night.  Steaks done as ordered.  Lobster perfectly cooked. Service is top notch. I am a Los Angeles foodie and I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Quiet and romantic atmosphere in the back by the large windows.  Friendly service and large portions.  Nice local steakhouse."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of three times. My first time I was new to the hotel and saw their menu and instantly got excited. I dined with my sister and we enjoyed our first visit. My steak was over seasoned but I overlooked that because of the great side and desserts we ordered. 

Second visit I brought the whole family. We absolutely loved everything and the food came out well seasoned. 

Third visit, today, I'm surprised that this dinner was downhill. All of the food was ridiculously under seasoned. I'm not one to make a fuss but it was over $200 for three people so you can imagine my disappointment that the food was not up to par. Especially since they just opened and we were their first table. The soups we ordered were fresh and great but I could smell something burning and realized my first bite into my medium well steak that it was well done and tasted burnt. The creamed corn my mother was excited to order was bland, although her mashed potatoes were great. I really enjoyed their scalloped potatoes my other visits but this time it looks disgusting. It was drowned in cream which probably explains the lack of flavor. It didn't taste like anything. 

At least my father and mother enjoyed their fish. And they took the corn off of the bill. 

Wanted to bring some out of town friends here but seeing that it's a hit or miss I'm not so sure anymore. Can't really take that risk at a pricey restaurant."}
{"text":"Always been a great, solid dining experience. I'd like to see the menu get changed up more often, though. Their bone in rib eye and fillet are superb. 

Have had every appetizer on the menu and all are flavorful beyond belief. My favorites are the lump crab and beet salad and the poke. 

Fabio ALWAYS takes GREAT care of us. Hopefully he will for you too!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had an amazing time at this restaurant. Our waiter (wish I remembered his name!) was fantastic, very friendly and knowledgeable. I ordered the filet and I'm serious it was one of the best filets I've ever had (and I've had quite a few!). I like my steaks done medium rare and I can't tell you how many times I've had chewy meat and was told \"oh, that's because it's medium rare\". This is not true if it's a good piece of meat. This was in my top 2 for filets, absolutely incredible. We also had the lobster bisque which was so creamy and amazing. My fiancé had Lamb I believe and he was very happy with his dinner as well. We got in without a reservation although I got the feeling it would be a good idea to make one. Anyway, we will ABSOLUTELY be back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This might be the best steakhouse in Las Vegas.   Try the bone in ribeye and lobster tail."}
{"text":"After a one star experience at this place and a subsequent talk with the manager, we were invited to give this restaurant another try. This review is based only on our second visit.
Our waiter was very attentive, but did not have the best knowledge about the wine menu. The wine menu is great and they have so many different kind of wines all over the world - that is remarkable. But in my opinion I should not get a recommendation from the waiter for a wine that he can not find on the wine menu and request me to do the search. We finally came to a conclusion and got our choice of wine served. He showed me the bottle, opened it, gave me the cork and wanted to pour the wine. There was no wine decanter he brought with himself and we had no wine glasses. But what was he doing??? He took two glasses from the free table next to us, instead of taking them from the bar or kitchen. You can not do like this in an upscale restaurant. We still had no wine decanter and got our wine poured into our glasses. Dear waiter, please learn how to hold a wine bottle, when you pour in. It is a $150 wine bottle and not a plastic bottle of purified water. Ok, enough complaints - our overall experience turned out very well... Some minutes later we got our Appetizer. It was the Prime Filet Carpaccio, made of the finest and highest quality products - top notch. The overall taste from the mustard dressing was a little bland, but still an excellent Appetizer. We could not wait for our entree. We both ordered the dry aged bone-in Filet Mignon medium rare with the complimetary bernaise, peppercorn and bordelaise sauces with macaroni and cheese and cheddar and onion scallop potatoes for the sides. I have to state that I got the best steak ever in my life. This is the place for having a steak - I am more than 100% sure. Some words to the sauces, but do not understand them as a complaint, just as a statement. All three sauces tasted delicious. After talking to our waiter, we got the information from him, that it was not a real bernaise sauce, but tasted still outstanding. The bordelaise sauce tasted for me a little bit too much after burned sugar (more in the licorice direction), but had its own oustanding taste. The peppercorn sauce was absolutely brilliant and my personal favorite. After this excellent meal we had no room for a dessert, we just ordered two espressi. Unfortunately the espressi did not have any crema on top and the taste was not rich. It must have come from be the used beans, because the machine they have is first class. So, thank you again for this outstanding food experience. My wife and I decided, if we come back to Las Vegas we will stay for sure in the M again and visit Anthonys Prime Steak and Seafood for dinner. With a more complete waiter service I can easily update my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Stayed at the M for two nights, we were excited to go to Anthony's and actually made reservations (not really necessary) two nights prior.  We have enjoyed many \"high end\" meals and were expecting to spend $150-200 between the both of us.

We were seated by a nice girl, then it turned bad. Our waiter \"Darrin\" arrived and asked my husband if he wanted water with or without bubbles. My husband asked the waiter if he had a beer list, and the waiter says and I quote \"Well right now I'm taking the water.\"  Husband is pretty shocked and laughs (thinking its a joke).  And says ok I'll take a water without bubbles.  Waiter leaves and we realize this guy isn't joking.  

Comes back with the water and Husband asks again for a beer list.  \"Darrin\" the waiter asks well what do you like.  Husband says we are big craft beer fans what do you have.  \"Darrin\" says well I'll be here all night if I tell you all of them.  This guy has some damn nerve, rolls his eyes and lists two beers.  

I know what husband wanted to do to waiter but he calmly ordered two apps and a check. Worst service we have ever had for a \"nicer\" restaurant.  \"Darrin\" thanks for representing your beautiful hotel with such disrespect.  Just to add insult to injury the waiter gives us a complimentary white chocolate candy that read \"Happy Birthday\" instead of \"Happy Anniversary\". He says oops I guess they messed up and leaves.

On a better note front desk staff was great, Jayde Fuzion's staff was terrific.  I will be forwarding this to their management considering we bought 2 rooms (inviting guests to visit us) gambled for hours and visited every restaurant they had."}
{"text":"We ate here about a week ago and everything was amazing. From the time we sat down our server helped with recommendations. We had oysters as a starter and then the ribeye and chicken for dinner both were amazing. Mac and cheese side was great also the tater tots. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Anthony's for several months. The reason is the quality of the food.  This visit we decided to check it out again to see if anything changed. Ordered the Lobster Special which was good but not excellent as it was dry!  The worse was the steak served with a lot of fat attached to that thick inedible layer of hard fat.  Only ate 1/3 of meat.  It looked like a untrimmed steak.    The scalloped potatoes were under cooked.  Did not eat any after unable to put my fork in it.  Servers were invisible, poor service!  I would like to call this my favorite steak house but it lets me down every time.  With so many great steak houses in Vegas, you would expect exceptional food and service. Very disappointed!  Needs a new chef!"}
{"text":"This is one of the finer steakhouses in Las Vegas.  Great service and fine meats.  The sides are marvelous and the horseradish is wonderfully strong!"}
{"text":"Great service + Quiet & Chill + amazing dining + beautiful decor + completely transparent kitchen 

This is one of the best kept secrets in Vegas! It's off the strip and tucked away in the M, I've been here a few times over the years, it's consistently an amazing dining experience with reasonable prices given the quality of the food. Pictures don't it justice, it's seriously gorgeous with tons of space between tables and marvelous decor. The tables & seats are comfy!

Food is awesome across the board, the have dry and wet aged steaks & prime rib. Everything is awesome! The sides are on par and as expected!"}
{"text":"Let's admit it where in VEGAS every steakhouse is four to five stars. I've been to them all Anthony's makes me feel like warm and welcomed walking right in the door. The manger Frank came to make sure that we were satisfied with our experience, which is very important to me since I am in the service industry. Hands down the server DEREK is on point make sure you request him right when you walk in. Service was impeccable. You will have one of the best experiences even ordering the tots off the menu. Perfection."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to try this place out as there was not a lot of people in the restaurant. For starters, it is off the strip at the M Resort, but I had some friends that were staying there for a tournament so I we tried the steakhouse out. It was not crowded so the service was really good. I was surprised with the quality of the steak - i had the 22 oz bone-in rib eye and it was cooked quite well. It came topped with some shoestring onions and also a side of bernaise sause (you could choose from a variety of sauces as well). My friend had the fish (forgot which one), but it was also very good. The price of the food is a little lower than some of the places on the strip and since the restaurant only recently opened, they are definitely trying their best to please you. I would say that its a good option for those not wanting to spend too much money and are willing to explore places off the strip where it is definitely not as crowded."}
{"text":"This review is not for the food or dining, it's only for the reservation & host/management experience.  In short, making a reservation means nothing!  I reserved a table for 4 on Saturday night at 7:15pm to welcome my colleagues to a nice meal while staying at the M Resort & Casino.  It was crowded when we arrived, and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation. I asked if we could go to the bar while we wait, and she said there was no room there either.  So we went to a Casino bar & came back 30 minutes later, and the manager told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes.  They weren't at all polite, they acted like we were being a pain for coming back. SERIOUSLY?!  So I asked them to take my number down & call me when the table was ready, and she begrudgingly did.  Well, they NEVER called me to say our table was ready.... good thing we snagged one at the Burger & Brews place next door.


Clearly, Anthony's doesn't know how to manage their reservations.... obviously an OpenTable reservation doesn't guarantee you a table.  We were super let down because the menu looks great, but I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for Valentines Day and they sat us on a made up table by the Kitchen??? It was hot,bright and embarrassing! Even the waiter name Hector was not even in a good mood! 
We stood up and found a manager to find us a different table.
Found out the menu was different from their website.Food was good but Pricey...
I don't want to ruin Valentine's Day and my Birthday,so... Whatever!"}
{"text":"The first time that I came here was when my parents were in town. The waiter messed up the order between the craziness of my family and another family of one of my dad's golfing buddies. It was not really an inconvenience with it being a relaxed meal for us, but the waiter went out of his way to try to make it right. They bought a round of drinks, brought a couple extra sides out and a big plate of bite sized desserts. Even with a little mistake, it was a great experience. I have been back regularly since and my absolute favorite thing on the menu was the heirloom tomato and burrata salad. They made a change to the salad from burrata to buffalo mozzarella and I was honestly a little skeptical at first, but it was just as fantastic! The steaks are quality and perfectly cooked. The only thing that I have not been a fan of was the massive tots they have. I will continue to take people here and tell people about this place and that heirloom tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad!"}
{"text":"I'm so surprised to read all the good reviews as I just had a pretty bad meal. The appetizers were amazing but it seems like they promote them and then sell them at half price in happy hour to make sure the locals come in and have a good time drinking and snacking. We had the calamari and sashimi ahi tuna - both were very good, especially the tuna. We then ordered lobster ravioli (i've had better from Fresh and Easy) and a filet. The filet wasn't bad but I know packet mashed potatoes when I eat them and these were absolutely, 100%, packet mixed mash. I was so surprised after such good appetizers. I wouldn't normally say anything but I just couldn't help it. The chef didn't come out, all I got was \"oh no, they are definitely freshly made, I eat them every day\"
Sorry but I won't be back and I can recommend much better locals restaurants which are much cheaper. I just feel sorry for the guests staying there who know no better"}
{"text":"This place was the tits. Excellent. I went here and it's not on the strip, OMG, OMG it's not on the strip. Grow up people. The M hotel on Las Vegas blvd, is nicer than many hotels \"on the strip\". It's on Las Vegas blvd about 7 miles west of Mandalay bay. The rooms yesterday on a Saturday night were going for $349. Ummm, I think it's a little nicer than ballys or harrah's. I would compare it to Mandalay bay. Only thing hotels on the strip have over the M hotel is the headlining shows, that's it. The steakhouse is 5 stars, start to finish. Food, ambience, atmosphere. Bang, 5 stars. But wait, it's not \"on the strip\""}
{"text":"Food 4 star, prices are higher than any fine seafood and steakhouse I've ever been to though. Especially at an off strip casino. If you just hit the big jackpot, go for it! Lol."}
{"text":"My boy friend and I decided to go to Anthony's Prime Steakhouse for his birthday. He has been here a few times and highly recommended this restaurant. It is always fun to go to the M Resort. The waiter was very nice and attentive. They served a variety of breads. We ordered a bottle of wine and it was 33% off. How cool! We both ordered the rib eye steaks. He ordered the big 21 oz. steak and I ordered the smaller one. It was fantastic, juicy, tender, and tasty. We shared the chopped salad, loaded baked potato, and asparagus. Nothing is better than a delicious rib eye steak. After dinner, we received a birthday surprise. They served us chocolate covered strawberries, raspberries, and cream. It was a splendid way to end a marvelous dinner. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This is a top notch joint in Las Vegas.  Food and service are excellent.  Good place to go for a nice steak."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend last night. We were really looking forward to this place based on much of the praise here on Yelp.

My first impression of the ambiance here was that it was too open and sterile. It definitely lacks the intimacy of most steakhouses. I was with a friend, but if I were on a date, I certainly would have chosen another restaurant.

The service was good, but certainly not top notch. When you go to a steakhouse, you expect a much more refined staff. Don't get me wrong... The staff here was friendly and attentive, but their approach was more of what I'd expect at a Cheesecake Factory.

Looking at the wine list, there were many names that I have become familiar with over the years. However, their wines are VERY overpriced. I've been to a number of steakhouses, and this is the first where I've seen at least 90 percent of the wines marked up over $100 a bottle. The only wines that were below $100 were cheaper names like Beringer. This was a major disappointment for me. Wines should not be marked up this much. We ended up with a bottle of cabernet sauvignon that cost about $50, but really tasted more like a typical $25 bottle.

We started our meal with the prosciutto salad. Incredible. It was the perfect combination of salty and sweet favors.

My friend ordered the bone-in ribeye. I ordered the bone-in filet mignon. I've never hear of a bone-in filet, but it was truly amazing. Definitely the best filet I've ever had. My friend's ribeye was very good as well. Both of us added the shrimp as a seafood option. I don't know what they did, but the seasoning on the shrimp was not good. My friend gave me his shrimp because he couldn't stand the taste. He said it tasted like the smell of an electrical transformer from a toy train set.

We were so full by dessert that we could not order the chocolate souffle that our server suggested. Instead, we opted for the berries soaked in a marnier sauce of some kind. It was very good.

Overall, the food at Anthony's exceeded my expectations (except for the shrimp). Unfortunately, for me, wine is a big factor. Seeing that they more than double their wine prices compared to higher-end steakhouses is just unacceptable. Do I regret dining here? No. But I would probably not return to Anthony's given other steak alternatives in the Las Vegas/Henderson area.

Personally, my suggestion would be to visit Hank's Fine Steaks & Martinis at Green Valley Ranch."}
{"text":"\"Manners maketh man\"
..or at Anthony's steak house, \"Manners maketh 5 star rating.\"

Every time I come here, the service is exceptionally well. I came here twice so far for dinner, and never had any issue finding an open table. From the host to the servers; they all do an amazing job keeping the place feeling very professional, clean, friendly, welcoming, and attentive. 
Water cups are always filled nearing half cup, and servers were great at checking up on us or changing out our plates while still maintaining just enough space for our group to have our dinner socializing in peace.

Food can be a bit pricy depending on what your order, and plates like the steak and lobster ($74) can really rack up your bill pretty quickly. But if you aren't in the mood for splurging, there are still plenty of shareable appetizers like the giant asparagus, and wild mushrooms that will entertain your palate with flavor.

Also FYI: the macaroons are a must try on their dessert menu!

I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their filet mignon soon. If you wanna good place to impress your tinder date or just spoil yourself for that hard day of being yelled at work (you know you deserve it) Anthony's is the place to do it."}
{"text":"--Rant---

Service...it's all about the service...

The food was great! Tasty and such. I got a modified Salmon and Asparagus dish.  Well prepared, the salmon tasted fresh and pretty much melted in my mouth. Like the jackass I am, I asked for my usual \"No additional Salt\" \"How do you cook the food\", etc. etc.  The stuff that usually makes waiters hate/remember me. hahaha  This guy was very accommodating and assured me the food will be prepped to my preferences. Homie came through #LikeABoss~

Atmosphere was fantastic and a bit fancier than I had anticipated. So when you go try not to wear tank and shorts type clothing ahah.  Go for more Business Casual or general Fine Dining attire.

Service...this place ROCKS...so let's explain..basically the waiter came out with MY food but not my GF's food. Then he said something to my GF along the lines of \"I think your food is going to take longer than I anticipated. My apologies, we will NOT be charging you for your meal\".  Under my breath I was like \"Aw Hell Yeah!!!\" hahahah savin' money on V-DAY FTW!!!!

---Overall---

Service: A-.  Absolutely appreciate the adjustment in the bill given the prices!  However the food still came out late. I wouldn't have minded so much but this was more of an inconvenience to my GF, which I still took a bit of an offense to.

Food: A. As expected for a fine-dine place...hell it better be given the price!

Atmosphere: A. Clean, very nice and well-lit."}
{"text":"We were seated at the worst table in the restaurant (up next to the glass partition to the kitchen and next to the waiters' service area) even though we had reservations and there were many unoccupied tables when we got there.  I guess my husband didn't tip the Maitre d' enough.  The prime rib was OK - somewhat flavorless and chewy.  The scalloped potatoes were delicious. We decided to share the creme brulee for dessert.  It was beautifully presented with a sugar dome and berries but light on creme brulee.  I would suggest ordering one for each person.  The service was awesome!  All in all, a mixed bag."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE STEAKHOUSE EVER!!!!!!!!

BEST mac n cheese I have had in my entire life

My gf and I go here 2+ times a month and love every minute of it"}
{"text":"After having a bad couple of days over the 4th of July weekend, my wife and I decided to take a chance and go to some place new and so we headed over to the M Resort and Spa!  We were hungry and it was my wife's 50th birthday. We asked a worker on the floor to recommend a place to eat and told us all the restaurants in the hotel were excellent, give that woman a raise! Great answer! We asked about the Oyster Bar over at Anthony's Prime Steak and Seafood. She told us she is a huge fan of the pan roast and that's what we were looking for! so we head over there and it was not busy but it was not empty either.  We sat at the Oyster Bar area and the aromas there was just inviting. I have to agree 100% with the last reviewer \"Amazing food, ambiance, and service.\" It sure was indeed. We both had the Shrimp pan roast and one thing is for sure, they did their homework and went to the Palace Station oyster bar to see what made them so uniquely amazing and how was Anthony's version be a little bit better, the answer! More flavor and bigger SHRIMP!!!! OH HELL YEAH BABY! THAT'S THE TICKET! We were just blown away by the dish I enjoyed with a glass of pinot noir.  The chief's that evening were awesome too, even let us have a sample of their soups, we are coming back! 
Once are meals were done, we were ask if we wanted deserts, I mentioned it was my wife's birthday... Although it was the 4th we were a day late to celebrate because of things needed  to be taken care of the day before. As soon as I mentioned Birthday our awesome waiter just stopped me and said he'd be right back. Few minutes later he came back with a chocolate moose that was out of this world and made our evening that much extra special! 

If you never been to the M but you've seen drive into Vegas from the I15, do yourself and favor and check it out!

I'm not a food critique, just a fan of good food that likes to write about my experience, So go out and experience food and be the judge."}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had. I think the French Fries might be the best also. It's very expensive but worth it. You can't get anything bad here."}
{"text":"Went here for my mom's birthday. What a great night! Excellent meal with leftovers for the next day.

I got the lobster bisque and filet mignon. It was delicious. They brought a basket of different breads for the table. If you like bread, you will love this basket.

My brother and I split the tab for my mom's birthday. Total bill was around $300 for 5 people including a bottle of wine, apps, and entrees. Worth it!

Would visit again if in the area."}
{"text":"Always love the experience at the Anthonys restaurant... we have a wonderful time when dining will return again... it has a good view of the pool and of las vegas... will definitely bring my wife back for nice romantic meal..."}
{"text":"Service is always on point. The food size is very generous. and the FOIE GRAS is a MUST on any and every steak."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant, delicious food, excellent service. Prices are a little high but hey, it's Vegas. The stuffed dates are sweet and savory but could use a little more sauce (just a tad bit dry), the french onion soup was very cheesy and savory and the steak (we got filet mignons) had wonderful flavor and tenderness. Get the merlot sauce, it is to die for!
Service was very attentive and our drinks were always full. This is a great restaurant on the far side of town!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. I had the sole fish and was well prepared with a great wine sauce. Sides are delicious. I also had the crab beet salad which I also think is really good (if you like beets). Excellent strawberry shortcake and really good chocolate soufflé. I don't think you can go wrong on the food.
Excellent service and good decor. Pretty pricey though so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Great service. Breakfast was clean and fresh. The omelette was a bit bland, but I was okay with the natural flavors.  For the price, I probably would rather wait and eat at the buffet."}
{"text":"Ended up here after we tried going to Cebo Veloce, I guess they closed over a year ago. Ooops! This was a fantastic place to \"end up\". I got a good vibe immediately entering. There is an elegant, casual atmosphere with dim lights, it was very open with a contemporary modern feeling and intimate booths. We ordered from the oyster bar, the kumamoto oysters were excellent, and the prime filet carpaccio was good as well. We wanted something that we could both share and sample, so I chose the sea bass (soy glazed) I was a little nervous at first because I don't like ponzu sauce, I find it too salty, but this dish was surprisingly really good. Second dish was the special of the night which was a bison steak with foie gras. This was a table favorite, if they offer this while you're there, get it. The sides we ordered didn't disappoint. They also have a very impressive wine list, large selection of California, Italian and French, and the best part, bottles were 1/3 off! I found a 2007  Malbec, Terrazas, Afincado. Excellent, try it!

Will most likely come back again, especially to try happy hour."}
{"text":"Great for special occasion. Went for wedding anniversary dinner. Got the steak and it was cooked just right.  Don't have to dress up which we like."}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner here, The escargot was very good, Are serving team did a great job,"}
{"text":"I am hesitant to share this review with others because I enjoy that I have never had to wait to get seated and it is never crowded... But a good place deserves its recognition so here I go...

Venture off the strip and into this classy restaurant. The whole ambiance is dim lit classy. I don't think they require you to dress up a certain way when eating here but it's definitely fitting for a nice date night attire.

I've eaten here several times and I've experienced eating here with a party of 4 up to a party of 12 (where we had our own private room even though we never asked for one).

THE FOOD: The food is excellent! Their steaks are delicious. My favorite is the prime rib made medium rare. My husband has ordered the rib eye and the porter house in the past. From my recollection, I've also ordered their seafood and steak combo and they were all delicious! The sides definitely trigger the reward centers in my brain. Their mac n' cheese has a nice crunch and creaminess to it. Their creamed spinach also has a delicious flavor although the last visit we had the spinach was a bit on the watery side (must have been a fluke). I tried their corn for the first time last weekend and it's now my new favorite SIDE from Anthony's.

THE DRINKS: They have your usual glass of water and they keep it coming. I recommend ordering a bottle of wine to go with your meal. They have a good variety to select from however, during our last visit, they didn't have the bottle of wine we wanted so they quickly offered us a similar bottle with approximately the same pricing.

THE SERVICE: They keep it classy from pulling your chair back to rearranging anything on the table that looks off. They always walk by your table to make sure everything looks good. The server we had during our most recent visit was a man named, \"Anthony\" and he even offered to take our picture but not after he made sure our table setting was cleaned up and we all had wine in our glasses. The host/hostess have been very polite and accommodating. We have never had a bad experience with service here. 

PARKING: This place is located inside the M Resort so there's parking outside. The open parking (not garage) is closest to Anthony's. 

LOCATION: This place is literally attached to another Anthony's restaurant which is a burger joint. Still very classy. There's also other restaurants attached to it.

RESTROOMS: Very clean."}
{"text":"This is by far, my FAVORITE place to eat when I visit Las Vegas. 
As we all know, Las Vegas boasts countless restaurants that serves high quality food with exceptional service and exquisite ambiance, so for me to make such a statement about Anthony's being my favorite, it really means something. 
What I strongly suggest :

1. Caesar salad - the best Caesar salad ever! I mean the BEST!
2. Wedge salad - this is also very delicious. The bacon on top of the wedge, is superb and their blue cheese dressing is amazing.
3. Oysters - fanny bay and kumamoto... you can't go wrong
4. tomahawk steak - this is limited so they don't carry this all the time, but if you're in luck to order, you should not hesitate. This is SO yummy

The food is always so good but what makes this place a top notch is their service. Dave and Edward are the best servers ever! They REALLY take a good care of you.

I will be back at Anthony's again soon! Hopefully very soon :)"}
{"text":"As far as local steakhouses go Anthony's is the only one I keep returning to.  From the upscale modern design and the quite informal atmosphere and general lack of pomposity from the staff.  I feel comfortable dining here in a black punkrock t-shirt & facial piercings.  I have never been treated as if I didn't deserve just as good service as the yupp's

Try not to go nuts on the bread & butter assortment.  The course portions are large and I know that thin seasame flat bread is pretty tasty.

The appetizers are more than adequate and the mains are what stay on my tongue.  They are all beautiful and consistently taste great regardless of which shift or chef is on duty.  That says a lot about a restaurant, when you don't have to hope it's as good as last time.

The torchon of Foie Gras is noteworthy.  Creamy with the usual garnishments.  I've tried worse at more hyped restaurants.

The Shrimp Scampi is jumbo crispy, saucy and a rather large appetizer for just 3 shrimp. I recommend. 

The oysters Rockefeller are probably my favorite anywhere.  Never over cooked.

The shrimp cocktail has the same giant prawns as the scampi but the cocktail sauce is prepared with generous horseradish or ginger.  A Vegas classic done right.

The 22 or so oz. Bone-in Prime rib of beef is a knock out with bordelaise and I swear there were stong hints of black truffle all over it.  I like it more rare than others and everyone has a different opinion of what medium rare is.  I order a cut this big as medium rare, because I have a brain, and it is going to be perfect in the middle for my tastes everytime because it is gigantic.  I usually have it with the wild mushrooms and those must be truffle laced also?  I'm sure you could request a foie gras on top but at 22oz you wouldn't be able to devour it all and I'm not sure how well Foie would hold up as a left over.

I could never get myself to order anything other than this as a main course.  It is my favorite steak.  Period.  Now I didn't give 5 stars because I am aware that all these dishes are standard steakhouse and seafood fare.  I have to honestly admit that some places can probably do a better job on some things but as a whole food experience this place wins out on the craving meter for me.  

It's a modern-day ratpack menu restaurant and I'm part of the new old fashioned.  So I highly recommend Anthony's."}
{"text":"Anthony's...just as good as its former Terzetto's.  Same great steaks and seafood (according to Hubby) and same great service.  We only had one iffy time while it has been Anthony's and our server corrected the problem immediately and professionally.  To preface this, we NEVER send back food but our steaks were clearly overdone; my filet was ordered medium but came out well done while Hubby's bone-in ribeye was ordered medium rare but, came out medium-medium well.  Again, I can't stress how well our server handled the situation.

When we go out for steaks, we're pretty much creatures of habit, filet mignon, ribeye, or bone-in ribeye.  Steaks at Anthony's are top-notch and can rival any steakhouse on the Strip.  Steaks do come with complimentary sauces such as bearnaise, bordelaise, and peppercorn--try the bordelaise!!!!  Another thoughtful note Anthony's provides for their steak diners are the complimentary roasted tomato topped with parmesan and a petite mixed greens salad with a very light lemon viniagrette.  For those of you who like french onion soup, please note they must've changed their recipe when they transitioned from Terzetto's to Anthony's.  The french onion soup tastes like it has tomato sauce/paste in it now; it used to be a robust beef stock flavor.  Sides are very good here.  I highly recommend their creamed corn.  Tater tots should be ordered only if you are having a very light dinner, as they're very dense and heavy.

Again, service is A to A+ and can also rival some of the most elite steakhouses on the Strip.

The contemporary decor in Anthony's hasn't changed much since it was Terzetto's.  It's still a very large restaurant with tons of seating options.  It has the oyster bar adjacent to it and a regular drinking bar off to the side.

Great place for dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this steak house! Food is amazing service was wonderful as well. We tried oyster, king crab legs and some bone in rib eye, chillin sea bass, fillet mignon. Amazing! My steak was a bit cold but still good. I would have gave 5 stars if it wasn't for that reason."}
{"text":"I've come here twice more since my previous review, and both experiences have been fantastic. 

Each and every person who accommodated our table was exceptional, as they have been all of the times I've dined here. 
Our waiter, Bruno, was amazing. 

Things to eat here: creamed corn, scalloped potay-tays, lobster bisque, ribeye steak, and the lychee martini (their drinks are on point)."}
{"text":"The bone in filet mignon (I know that is a contradiction in terms) is the finest filet I've ever tasted. The seared ahi tuna was perfectly done and fresh. Service was friendly and professional, a little gregarious but in line with what you'd expect from a Vegas steakhouse.

Ambiance was very nice, decor is tasteful neo-modern. The bill can be a shock, but if you're looking for a quality steak in Las Vegas in an upscale casino environment, plan to pay."}
{"text":"So close to my house but not even close to some of the steakhouses we frequent. My few experiences were meh.  I've had the filet, sides, and fish dishes here. Never impressed, tons of better options close"}
{"text":"An early Aug 2015 happy birthday with a steak & king crab dinner at Anthony's Steakhouse with an awesome 2010 cab from ZD wines followed by a surprise birthday dessert of grand marnier creme brulee & chocolate dipped strawberries. I ended my night overlooking the pool sipping on scotch and smoking a cigar with my handsome date. I'm excited to be going back again this year!"}
{"text":"Pleasant experience the times we have ate here. Most often we hit the happy hour in the bar for beer and appetizers which have all been delicious. Visited the main restaurant for steak dinner and all is well there. They let us split the bone in rib eye with no extra plate charge (we are not big eaters) and had the side of creamed spinach. Both recommended and excellent. Service could not be any better from all the staff. Desert also looked good, but no room."}
{"text":"Good service and atmosphere. No more expensive then other higher end steakhouses on the strip."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent and our waiter Edward was great.  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu really.  The wine is overpriced however but they have a great selection.  If they brought the prices of wine down 50% I would eat there more."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best locals casino steak house and it would give any LV strip steak house a run for its money.

Everything here is delicious.  Be sure to get the foie gras apppetizer, especially if you're coming from California!  It's pan seared and accompanied with toasted brioche and a fruit compote.  You top everything on the brioche and make love to it.  It's so good.

The butter poached scallops come in a trio and are so rich, buttery, with salty sea goodness.   Be sure to get the clam chowder as well.

As for entrees, I typically go for the bone in filet mignon.  Just be sure to pick up the bone and go K9 on it.....leave your manners at home.  The juices and meat is the best on the bone.

To round it out, order the chocolate souffle 15-20 minutes before you're finished with your main entrees.  

They also have excellent seafood options and you can also order from the seafood menu.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for Valentine's day and it was some of the best food I've ever had!! 

Appetizer: We shared the Southwesten Shrimp and my God although the portion was small, it was absolutely incredible!!! The shrimp was juicy, the sauce was spicy, the corn gave it some sweetness and the cornbread just amazing. Combine it all for the perfect bite. The bread basket was meh. I prefer warm, fresh bread and soft butter. 
Main: we had the new york and filet minon. My filet was like butter. Perfectly cooked. We got the tator tots and cheddar & onion scalloped potatoes. Double yumm.
Desert: We shared the chocolate souffle. Omg. It was like a dream. Devoured it.
Drinks: We ordered the coconut martni and chocolate martini. Both were pretty big and definitely strong. No complaints. 
Setting: We had one of their high tables. Wouldn't call it romantic exactly and hard to get on the chairs. Next time I will request a booth.
Service: slooooow. I know it was a holiday but it took forever getting water refilled, dessert ordered or paying our bill. I mean our server was nice enough, but the lack of attentiveness was a little annoying. 

In conclussion, the food was beyond amazing. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night to celebrate my birthday. It was our first time there so we were very excited to try another dining spot at the M resort. We arrived at our reservation time and the hostess was very nice and polite and showed us to our table which was in the back of the main dining room, which was perfect because it was away from all of the action and private.

Our server Dave and his team were on point from the start. They got us everything that we ever could want and or needed. They were very friendly and amazing and made us feel like we were their only guests of the evening.

The food was amazing and the portion sizes were impressive. When Dave said that most people order one vegetable and one starch for the table he didn't lie. The side dishes were impressive.

Btw:martinis are fantastic...."}
{"text":"Waiter was good, but drink/assistant waiter was the best.   Food was good.   Not great, but not bad."}
{"text":"Never been inside the M Resort.  Twas 'bout time I explored the SE part.  Dark outside on the drive over, but had no idea homes existed out there.  Lights are so pretty at night, and you can tell there's still lotsa space to develop the area.

Intended to have dinner at the M.  No clue where or what.  In a hoodie, jeans, & Old Navy moccasins, wandered into Anthony's feeling like seafood for dinner.  It's a formal white tablecloth dining atmosphere.  I'm feeling awkward but who's stink-eyeing me?

We ended up with a really cool waiter, Mario.  Timing to get our orders in was a little wait.  But I saw they were juggling a few tables and a few waiters were tending to us all.  Was cool since my new Yelp BFF and I had a chance to catch up on our lives.  Yeah we were \"badged\" by Yelp during this dinner :D

Da Luca Prosecco was a perfect choice since we were having seafood.  Aroma, flavor, sparkling fizz, bottle design, presentation - they poured and refilled for us although it was kept in a tall ice stand tableside.  Told you formal dining.

I had the Pan Seared Blackened Sea Bass.  The sea bass almost reminded me of fresh steamed seasoned king crab legs meat.  If I could spend this kinda money every week, I'd repeat this dinner!  Soooo excellently delicious!  

The sea bass was on a bed of steamed vegetables which I like to call a hot salad.  Something to do with the flavor in the veggies that reminded me of a salad.  Literally took me over an hour to enjoy my plate.  One cuz I am a slow eater; two cuz it deserved to be savoured.  Fish eaters, I highly recommend the sea bass.

Beautiful modern decor.  Glass wall cases surrounding the restaurant filled with wine bottles.  Where we sat, we were able to view the kitchen through a window wall.  It's really nice!  Bring anyone here for any reason."}
{"text":"Anthony's is one of those hidden gems off the strip in Las Vegas. World class food can be found here with their delicious 24oz ribeye, porterhouse steak or even exotic meats like buffalo. I've personally tried their ribeye and have gone back to try their porterhouse steak with each time surpassing my previous experience. Don't forget to ask for borderlaise   to go with your steak! Anthony's also dives into worthy seafood such as lobsters and their sides do not shy away from awesomeness. Their mac & cheese is definitely worth a bite, or two or three!

You definitely get what you pay for here but everything is worth the price."}
{"text":"All I can say is OK...

We love the M, our favorite hotel! We had our wedding here and had the filet from the catering group for the wedding! It was one of the best steaks we ever had, so we figured this steak house would be the same.

Unfortunately, it was not. The catering department blew away this steak place, not even on the same playing board. 

My wife and I took our families here...typical steak price point, maybe slightly lower, sat at the nice center table, service was great, steaks were OK. In the end, we won't return to this steak place, we will to the M for sure though!!!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the sum of all of my visits. I tend to eat here a couple of times a month.
Let me start by saying that I am a fan of the M as a whole, it has a very casual feel to it. 
Things I've loved...
Salads: Wedge, Chopped, Mozzarella and my favorite the Blue Crab & Beet.
Apps: Carpaccio & Ahi
Steaks: All. they seem to run a Wagyu Strip as a special every week and it's the best of the bunch.

Blah, blah, blah

The reason for this review is to tell what to avoid.
Blackened Ahi Tuna. I tend to avoid things that say blackened. My reasoning is that it typically a pre purchased, generic seasoning blend. I typically like to leave this option to a lower end restaurant, pub or dive bar. Well, my bad. I ordered it blackened. If you like that great, but this whole dish was a fail. 
Let me break it down one time. Blackened= High heat butter, seasoning. This was a quick sear (great for ahi) not so much for blackening. Lemon Grass-Soy beurre blanc. This tasted like Teriyaki  Sauce, which has no business near Louisiana. It was accompanied by  \"Risotto\"? It this point I am beyond the fact that \"Anthony\" is trying to fuse a bunch of flavors that don't get along with each other, but the Risotto is undercooked by at least 5 minutes, rendering it uneatable. When I pointed this out to the server, who was great, I saw the look of \"I knew this was coming\" cover his face. I got the impression he got that complaint a lot. The explanation; an apologetic  \"that's the way chef wants it. Hey, al dente is great, undercooked...not so much.
The waiter offered to replace anything I ordered. But hey, I ordered it. My bad, but this dish needs to come off of the menu or at least re worked. No, it needs to come off the menu. If that was my first visit my feeling about the joint my feelings may/would be different.


Oh yeah...Halibut over cooked and slightly dry.

That being said...I'd go back tonight.

People are not robots."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Anthony's Steakhouse yesterday for the first time.  It was a pleasant experience.  The décor has a relaxed cosmopolitan feel, with the marble floors, leather/chrome chairs hosting the white tablecloth tables and has an airiness/openness to the restaurant.  Service is good, and several lovely items on the menu--specifically their aged steaks.  I will admit their wine selections are very good.  Started the meal with the Oysters Rockefeller, six large oysters with a creamed spinach and loaded (very heavily) with a hollandaise sauce--good dish but is a little on the heavy side.  Next was the Lobster Bisque.  This was a very nicely done soup, small pieces of lobster and the cream/sherry base was wonderful--outstanding soup course.  Moved on to the salad--Bibb Salad, with shaved vegetables, some smoked blue cheese chunks and a wonderful tarragon-mustard dressing, simple and light.  Next course was the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras, this course was plated nicely, had a large grilled brioche that the Foie Gras was atop, accompanied with a blackberry jam and delicious pickled grapes.  Very good course--Foie Gras was excellent, grilled brioche was on the large side--could be halved.  My main course was the Filet Mignon, a 9 oz. wet aged steak--this was very flavorful and tender.  This was accompanied with a grilled artichoke and I had a wonderful bordelaise sauce (dry red wine, bone marrow, butter, shallots and a sauce demi-glace), also had a delightful jumbo asparagus with a garlic and lemon zest as a side vegetable.  All presented very well and enjoyable.  Finished the meal with a simple trio of sorbet--raspberry, coconut and mango--accompanied with a mix of blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries.  All the courses were all very well prepared and enjoyable, service was good.  Had an opportunity to meet with Matt--sous-chef--and with Frank Micalizzi--manager--both very pleasant and provided wonderful service.  This was a good experience but I would classify this restaurant as a great place for steaks and not so much on a fine dining atmosphere."}
{"text":"My family and I went to this wonderful restaurant and we all were more than pleased. My daughter had the gumbo and it was delicious!  The rest of us had Rib Eye and it melted like butter.  I have to admit the sides...macaroni & cheese, scallop & baked potatoes, asparagus,  clam chowder & creamed spinach were yummy!   Portions are large and great for sharing.  Also the dinner bread assortment is pretty awesome.  Try to take it slow, you will fill up quickly and you want to have room for your meal.   It was worth every penny, plus the fact it was off the strip.  The ambiance was relaxing, family friendly and completely romantic for two.
I would consider myself a bit of a Foodie, so I would urge other Foodies to try it out!"}
{"text":"Steak was superb! Appetizer soft shell crab was terrific! And the service from Dave and Anthony was superb! would recommend the drive to this place to eat the best steak with the best service and atmosphere. Nothing like it in  vegas!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Anthony's from their service to their food this place really makes me happy and never lets me down! This steakhouse is located inside the M resort and offers a killer happy hour 5-8pm half off all apps and select bottles of wine. The friendly staff is always timely and on point with their service and recommendations. Tonight I had the poké appetizer and ceaser salad to start both were on point. Went with the 9oz filet ordered medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. All the sides were solid portions and very tasty. Wasn't able to save room for dessert but I'm sure it follows suit with the rest of the menu! For being off the strip, this place will have you wondering why you would ever go to the strip to pay double the price!"}
{"text":"Tried this steakhouse on my buddy Gordon's recommendation. I have never been to the M hotel before. Very nice ambience - modern but subdued. The experience started with a friendly and professional hostess promptly seating us at our table. Our server Dave was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Had the Oysters Rockefeller, wedge salad, bone in rib eye steak, with three sides (scalloped potatoes, creamed corn, and mushrooms). The Oyster Rockefeller was excellent, not mushy like at Morton's, and the wedge salad was good with a pork belly strip (excellent). The rib eye steak was seared to perfection medium rare and the meat melted in my mouth; it was served with three sauces but I didn't even get a chance to dip a piece of steak into them because the steak didn't need any sauces. The sides were good but the creamed corn tasted like it was made fresh off the cob (not frozen or canned).   Dessert was incredible with my friend having a multi-faceted chocolate dessert (can't remember the name) - five textures in one dessert. I had the donuts with raspberry sauce - ate all 10 of them without noticing they were so light and delicious.  Their seafood selection looked excellent - the wife doesn't eat steak but their ginger soy marinated sea bass is something we will try next time.  Will be back with my wife soon !!"}
{"text":"While in Las Vegas, we had dinner at Anthony's Prime Steak and Seafood located at the M Resort off the Strip.  Way, way off... We had an unbelievably delicious foodie experience!  The restaurant wasn't too busy, as it was a weekday.  We had reservations and were seated at the chef's table, a large legless table that hung from the ceiling.  It sat the 14 of us comfortably right in front of the open kitchen. I can only attest to what I was able to sample and steal from others.  Rest assured, EVERYONE there enjoyed their food.

Starters:

Complimentary bread basket:  I could've just eaten this alone.  Can't believe it's free!
Kumamoto oysters on the half shell-Very fresh.  Outstanding!
Seafood Louie salad-Awesome!
Lobster Tacos-Spicy and delicious!
Stuffed tater tots-Large and filling!

Mains:

Filet Mignon and Bone-in Ribeye-Cooked perfectly as ordered and so tender!

Sides:
Creamed corn-The first thing to disappear! My kids couldn't stop eating it.
Mac and Cheese-Ooey Gooey Goodness!

I had a Pomegranate Martini, which was nicely made.  

The food here was so delicious and well prepared that I wanted to cry, smile, and laugh all at the same time!  I didn't know how to feel. 

Our server, Dave, was great!  Very knowledgeable, patient, and helpful with our food questions/choices.  He made us feel welcome and comfortable in this fine establishment.  


Absolutely worth a visit if you're in town!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nice ambience. Went light, a few flaws with the food presented. Next time  I'll go with a steak."}
{"text":"We stopped by the M Resort for some light bites and drinks. The oyster bar thats a part of Anthony's has and east/west motif to their menu. Half of the menu has Asian-inspired fare, while the other half has American fare. Three types of oysters were offered. We went with half a dozen of the smaller Kusshi oysters. Clean and mild tasting, they were a great start to our meal. Next up was a cucumber and watermelon salad ($10). I envisioned a beautifully composed, petite salad. What we got was the opposite. It was a large mound of lettuce, vegetables, and watermelon drowning in a kim chee vinaigrette. The flavors were somewhat bold and spicy but it was so heavy-handed that I could only eat a few bites.

We moved over to a different bar closer to their main dining room to check out their menu. Yup, a completely different bar menu. Not sure why they felt it necessary to have a separate menu, but whatever. The beef tartare ($22) was another heavy-handed dish. The cylindrical stack of beef sat atop mixed greens. On top of the beef was a substantial pile of pickled red onions and a quail egg. The dish was way too acidic, drowning in a sauce that was probably masking inferior beef. There were two more sauces needlessly spread across the plate. Talk about overkill... there were about half a dozen ingredients that should have been left off the dish.

The last item we tried were the lobster tacos ($24). Surprise, surprise... it was another heavy-handed dish with an excessive amount of ingredients. They used so much chipotle aioli and avocado mousse that I couldn't even taste lobster. Sauce was oozing out in every direction.

Anthony's has a menu -- or menus, plural -- that sound appetizing, but unfortunately the execution is lacking.

2.5 Stars"}
{"text":"I've now been to the M steakhouse 3 times.  Read my previous review for more in depth details on my first visit.

First, let's tackle the food.  Every time I've gone I've gotten the filet mignon.  The taste and seasoning is good, though I think it's a tad expensive for the size.  Just up the road at Silverton you can get a steak 30% bigger for $6 cheaper.  That said, I'm happy with the size, just not the price.  The sides are all about $9 or $10 (a fair price) and range from OK to pretty good.  The yukon gold mashed potatoes are top notch and a very large serving (would be enough for 2 people if that's the only side they order).  My fiancee likes the mushrooms.  The tater tot side is not something I liked -- basically reformed breakfast hashbrown potatoes with some cheese and bacon thrown in.  Just didn't taste right to me.

Let's get to the two major failings of this place, though.  First off, the bread basket.  It's pretty dismal, to be honest.  You get 5 types of bread: harder small white bread (not toast, but think slightly stale in terms of texture), softer large white bread, some raisin/nut bread combo, and two thin wafer types which have sesame and poppy seeds, respectively.  I don't like nuts in my bread, but that's a personal preference and I'm not going to hate on them for that.  What I don't like, and I don't think anyone likes, is cold bread.  Every time I've gone I've never even gotten room temperature bread -- it's always cold.  On top of this, the butter (which has salt on it -- a nice touch), has always been ice cold and rock hard.  Who wants cold bread and hard butter?  Spending a few minutes to warm it all up would make a world of difference.

The other major failing is their service. It has been very spotty and we've only had one out of three of our experiences be good, and none of the times we've been have they been busy.  The first time we went we had Derrick as a server and he really never came to the table (read my previous review).  After that, we had Bruno and he was very good.  The last time we went, we had Florin and he was by far the worst.  I believe he had a total of 3 tables, all parties of 2, including us.  It was a while before he came over to take the order then it was about 30 minutes before we received our order.  He stated that ordering a medium-well steak would take a while to cook thoroughly, despite the fact I ordered it butterflied.  At no time while waiting for the food to come did he give us an update or check on us, instead choosing to have 5-minute long conversations with the tables next to us.  We were within 30 seconds from getting up and walking out when our order arrived.  

A while after getting our food we were low on water and asked Florin for a refill.  He then immediately went to a nearby table and struck up another 5+ minute conversation.  We only got a refill when one of the busboys noticed we were low.  Hat's off to them as every time we've been there the busboys have been very attentive.  

At the end of our meal the entire table had been cleaned and we waited for the check as Florin again was at an adjacent table having a conversation.  He saw the busboys clear the table and even met eyes with us while he continued the conversation.

Following paying the check I saw Bruno, our previous waiter, asked for his name so I could tell the manager how good our experience was with him, and then spoke to a manager.  I let him know that Florin was the absolute worst and that Bruno was amazing.

Long story short, get some decent waiters and stop serving frozen bread and butter!"}
{"text":"We wanted to stay away from the strip and looking over the menu and reviews online thought this place would be a good choice. We booked a Valentine's Day reservation here and checked in only to be seated at a made up row of tables behind the host stand. The table was awkward and didn't feel like a nice romantic date at all but a place for people who check in to see what you ordered so we asked to be moved inside the dining room. For the price that we knew we would be spending, this table was a joke. 

Once we were seated at a different table, menus were brought over and we had a chance to look things over. After looking at the menu online, the first thing I noticed when I was given the menu was that prices had been raised a few dollars on every single item due to it being Valentine's day. I know that's how it works with fine dining and holidays, and we knew we would be paying for a nice night out and of course a fancy meal being the holiday, but we walked away paying $300 for a meal for two with a few drinks and two steaks seemed really excessive to me for the M resort. 

I ordered the surf and turf which included a filet mignon and a small piece of lobster which was $82. My husband ordered the tomahawk steak which was around $70 I believe. We also ordered a Caesar salad for $18 and scalloped potatoes for $11. 

The Caesar salad was good, huge pieces of Parmesan frico, salty anchovies and a perfect ratio of lettuce and dressing. My husbands steak was delicious as well. We could see the open kitchen from our table and the open grill method made for a flavorful steak when they topped it with butter and salt. My filet was also good and cooked a perfect medium. Neither steak needed any additional seasoning. The potatoes were probably my favorite. Thin slices of soft potato layered in between creamy cheese, butter and herbs. It was a nice helping and a great side for our steaks. The lobster tasted a little tough to me and I believe it had been over cooked. 

Our server was very busy, we could tell. We had to ask for a bread basket, drink refills seemed a little delayed and plates weren't cleared in a timely manner, but he was still good. 

I love the M and thought this was a good meal, but it wasn't an amazing meal. I just can't wrap my head around paying such a large price again for this steakhouse."}
{"text":"Visited Anthony's Steakhouse this weekend for our anniversary.  Made our reservation through Yelp and had no issue. When we arrived.

We shared the prosciutto salad which was perfect for 2 and I had a special Buffalo Surf and Turf while my wife had a bone in filet.  Both were very well done.  The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the cheddar and bacon stuffed tater tots.  Wasn't that great.

We did really enjoy our bottle of wine and with 30% off, it was $30. Nice.


Overall, it was a very good dinner.  Just not the cheapest. Worth it though for a special occasion and its not as crowded as the strip."}
{"text":"The M resort is kind of its own special type of casino. Its not on the strip swarmed by tourist, but its not a divey local's casino like many of the Station properties. It's filled with luxury amenities like many other tier one casinos, ie lush rooms, spa, pool, and one good restaurant.

Anthony's is easily the best restaurant at the M because besides having quality food, it has prompt and attentive service, spacious and scenic dining spaces, and modern decor. The menu is very classic American steakhouse and doesn't have any \"fuzion\" offerings like other places pretending to be something they're not. The meats come from the owner of the M resort's family farm (Marnell Family Double Fork Ranch) which sounds like a great way to cut cost from suppliers and offer steaks at more affordable pricing (without the extra strip steakhouse fee) . Most entrees range from $40s-$50s and do not come with sides ($9).

My favorite is the dry aged bone in rib eye and has came medium rare each time and secondly would be the sea bass that comes with a nice hard sear. Crab legs are still in shell, but cut for your ease of access, taste is pretty plain jane accommodated with butter. Salads come in a generous portion and no withering salad leafs in sight. I can't say any praise for the side asparagus though as it was limped and wet. As for adult libations there is an extensive wine menu, but I choose to partake in the $10 blue label special instead because... blue label.

Reservations are probably not needed unless you're bringing your company here for a large  dinner on the outside balcony with a view of the entire Las Vegas strip because the M offered you an unbelievably cheap price to room all your employees in their classic suites."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I can honestly say that this is the best steakhouse I've ever been to. It makes Claim Jumper look like McDonald's! Our server is usually Bruno, and he takes very good care of us. I always get the filet mignon, medium rare and it is always tender, juicy, cooked perfectly, and melts in my mouth like butter. My husband on the other hand, likes to order whatever the four-legged special is and he has yet to be disappointed. Most recently, he ordered the buffalo steak, medium rare. I tasted a bite and it was delicious. I wish that I had ordered it myself but that's what I get for not trying new things! As far as appetizers go, I like the oysters and crab. I'm not really a dessert person, but on Valentine's Day, our meal included a fruit and chocolate plate which was pretty good but again, I'm not a dessert person so it didnt really appeal to me. 

Writing this review has now gotten it into my head that my husband and I now need a date night so we can go to Anthony's!!"}
{"text":"Don't go anywhere else, this is the best steakhouse in town.  Everything is so good, I always get the sea bass, it's killer.  Hubby got the tomahawk for his 4-0 and two years later can't stop talking about it.  He's also loved the chops and other steaks.  Do not leave without trying the tater tots!  Once you've eaten here, every other steakhouse will pale in comparison."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had!

I went to Anthony's on New Year's Day night, after hearing several different people recommend it.  The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous on the inside, and the menu is full of amazing-sounding steaks and seafood.  Our server's name was David, and he made our experience PERFECT!  He was accommodating but not too pushy, and did a great job steering us towards entrees he thought we'd like.
We brought our own wine, but started out with a round of martinis, which were excellent.  I've been to restaurants where the server seemed miffed about us bringing our own wine, but David was quite the opposite: He complimented us on our tastes and poured the wine in a very professional manner.
We ordered: beef carpaccio (great), oysters (amazing, fresh, beautiful presentation), Bouliasbasse (the best I've had), and sea bass (tender, flavorful).
The food was paced out perfectly, where we didn't feel rushed but also didn't feel like we were sitting around waiting too long for the next round.
The ambience is lovely - a great place for a romantic dinner.  I probably wouldn't bring kids there, but only because it seems designed for adults who want a fantastic dinner in an upscale setting.  I can not think of one aspect for this restaurant to imrove upon.  It is great food, great service, and then prices are extremely reasonable!"}
{"text":"Celebrating for thé next two weeks our upcoming 1st #Anniversary

This is our 2nd time here...

We love the Buffalo special (when available) w bacon... for my hubby, of course ;-)

You cannot go wrong w their Sea Bass... absolutely fabulous!

Order the Colossal Crab & The Oysters without the cream sauce... you will not regret it! The cream sauce may be great, in fact,  I am sure it is... Was trying to keep it light tonight, so we went we the horseradish and cocktail sauce w lemons!

The Ahí appetizer, the Scampi, Mozzarella salad... All Yummy and on Point!

For dinner this time I had the Alaskan King Crab Legs... OMGee... that should explain it all!

The wait staff is very attentive and very knowledgeable when it comes to their cuisine and vinos... This is a big plus w me as sometimes everything looks too good for me to choose, so, I like when the server can confidently recommend what I should nosh on.

All in all a great place to enjoy some great food... try and sit by the Window facing the pool area...

Cheers!

{"text":"We love coming here for Happy Hour.  Great place to unwind and have some great food and drinks. We usually have a bottle of wine with our meal. Perfect for a quick get away."}
{"text":"Beware!

I have eaten here a few times over the past couple of months. Holiday dinner, birthday dinner and took some friends from out of town here.

Everytime I went, the wine was offered to us at 1/3 off. But when the bill came, the discount wasn't included. Mistakes happen, but after the third time, it makes you go hmmmmmmmmmm. 

It is a shame because the food is excellent, but the billing error left a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Of all the places we tried at the M Resort, this was the most ho-hum for me. The meat quality was just a bit better than average and the our side dishes and dessert were all relatively plain, like they just needed a few tweaks to spin them to the next level. 

The staff were great to us on both visits (we returned for cocktails on a different evening), but I definitely enjoy the other offerings at M Resort more."}
{"text":"Started with the Oysters Rockefeller, they were only so-so.  They weren't as hot as they could have been, and the hollandaise looked as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for more than a couple of minutes.  The bacon in the sauce was fatty and undercooked.  On the good side, the creamed spinach was nice and the oysters were large and fresh, but I wouldn't order it again.  

Followed that up with the bone-in filet, which was good...but nowhere near amazing.  It was tender, but not juicy at all, rather dry actually...even at medium rare.   

When we ordered the steaks, our waiter did not mention any sauces and our steaks arrived plain.  I had to flag down our waiter to order bearnaise for me and bordelaise for the wife.  The bearnaise was fine but the bordelaise was way too sweet.  We sent it back and got the peppercorn which was better but nothing to write home about.

We were disappointed with the service.  Made reservations on Open Table where I noted it was a birthday dinner.  The hostess wished me happy birthday, but that was it....nothing from the waiter and no complimentary or special dessert was even mentioned.  That was a bummer after seeing all the pics here of \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate and the nice comped desserts.

The highlight of the evening was actually in the bar before dinner where we had the Ahi tuna sashimi appetizer...it was excellent.  Everything else I felt was middle of the road and the steak was not, in my opinion, worth $52."}
{"text":"Food here has always been good. The filet mignon was very tender and the Mac and cheese was delicious!! Prices were a tad high but the service and food make up for it."}
{"text":"Dinner for 20+ for a friend's birthday in the private dining room.  

The private dining area located towards the back of the restaurant and outdoor patio is very nice.  Floor to ceiling windows with a really nice view adds to the overall experience.  

Service was top notch, Ed V. is the man and the general manager stopping by and spending a few minutes with our party was a nice touch.  

On to the food...

When you walk by the kitchen, the cooking stations is separated  from the dining area only by a glass wall.  Their method of cooking is on an adjustable grill over an open flame.  

I have been to a good number of the upper echelon steak houses (Mastro's, Ruth Cris, Chophouse, Morton's, Flemings, Vic & Anthony's, Etc.) and I have to put Anthony's up there in my top 5.  I do like my steak broiled at 1500 degrees topped off with butter, but the flavor of  my 22oz bone in rib eye was excellent, the type of flavor you can only get from a dry aged steak cooked on an open flame seasoned with a little salt and pepper.  They import the beef from their own cattle ranch, which made me think why wouldn't all steakhouses own their own ranch, not that I could tell a difference in the quality of meat but from the standpoint of owning a business that is centered around beef.

You have to try the mussels for an app, I could have drank the broth out of the bowl but had to restrain from revealing my membership to the league of Gluttonous Fat Bastards.  I did use about 2 loaves of bread to draw the broth; I wonder if anyone noticed that I was drinking the broth out of the shells after I had ate all the bread...I hope my GFB identity is still safe.

We had mac and cheese, hash browns, mushrooms and asparagus for shared sides, but to be honest after my GFB incident I didn't want to miss out on enjoying my steak so my side show was limited.

Fast forward; dinner was great and those private doors leading to an outdoor patio proved to be a huge benefit.  Nothing like getting outside for a scotch and cigar after a truly epic evening."}
{"text":"I was surprised. I had modest expectations that were summarily surpassed.

I had the 22 oz bone-in ribeye and it was outstanding. From the ranch of the M Resort owners. It was tender, juicy and flavorful.

Just a little less expensive than the high-end meat joints on the strip....steak in the 40s instead of 50s. But worth it.

Wine list is good, not great; but workable. Service was very good. 

This goes on my list of first-rate Vegas steakhouses.

Just opened so they're eager to please."}
{"text":"Derrick Anthony's service and knowledge of the menu lead to a perfect dinner meeting at Anthony's Steakhouse.

We all had the Buffalo Tomahawk bone in steak - cooked perfectly very flavourful and giant sized. The sides are family portions so order a couple for the table. Donuts, yes donuts made for a perfect finish. 

Wine was, $20  off a bottle so that made the experience perfect. It is worth the cost of the taxi from the strip or if a local to make the trip to the M for dinner. 

I will be there for again soon myself."}
{"text":"Amazing food. TheThe bone in ribeye was amazing. Along with the bacon wrapped dates an the lobster at so are to die for. Going to try the none in filet next time. This is definitely on my Fav. Place list"}
{"text":"The filet mignon with a side of bernaise and mashed potatoes were really tasty!  Not a huge fan of the lobster ravioli..  The staff was nice and tentative..  Overall a good experience.."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner here! The filets were perfect. The sides were great. The service was wonderful. And to top it off, the price was reasonable. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great quality food, upscale dining experience with top notch servers. We dined here during 2016 4th of July weekend and it was pretty packed here. The food was delicious and the ambiance was casual yet sophisticated. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I came here with my family on the last night of my bachelorette weekend visit (I'm from Vegas but no longer live there, and my parent live in Henderson) I've come to this restaurant quite a few times, and I've always had a good experience. This time we had Dave the waiter, and he was awesome! I've met those waiters who goof around, but it really doesn't \"fit\" the situation, and Dave was the exception to this. He was funny, and had a good sense of humor. I had a bad crab experience the night before, but decided to give crab another try here. I have to tell you, I've never had such sweet crab in my life! I was so happy with everything. He had forgotten my crab and I gave him a hard time about it (light hearted) and he was a total trooper about the whole thing. He even brought us Chocolate covered strawberries to make up for the crab being a little behind, and from my bad experience the night before at another restaurant. If there's another special for the buffalo filet, I HIGHLY recommend it! Tastes like butter! Sweet crab, awesome steak, two thumbs up. If you're lucky, you'll get Dave."}
{"text":"This was really an excellent meal.  I went to Anthony's last night and I'm so glad I did.  I had the 18 ounce, bone in filet done black and blue.  

First, the bread basket they bring you has a trio of breads from which to choose.  There was sesame lavash, raisin bread, and regular sliced French bread.  With it, they brought butter that had some olive oil on it to give it extra flavor and they ground sea salt on the butter.  Yay!

The steak was exactly the way I like it--charred and cool inside.  Just walk the cow through the kitchen!  On the plate were some small greens making a small salad, a small broiled tomato half, and a grilled pearl onion.  I ordered for a side the tater tots with bacon and cheese.  These little critters are excellent.  Grated potato formed into small barrels around some bacon and cheese and then fried.  Delicious!

I ordered the chocolate soufflé for dessert at the beginning so my server would have the chef start it as I was nearing the end of my steak.  I needed to get to the other side of Las Vegas for a show, and I was beginning to worry about the time I had to get there.  It turned out to be fine.

The wait for the soufflé was well worth it.  There was a rich chocolate flavor and with the soufflé there was a small pitcher of chocolate sauce with small round chocolate crisps.  I opened the soufflé and poured in some of that good sauce.  The whole thing is highly addictive and may be on a controlled substance list somewhere.

My server was Leon and he was great.  Someone was there to refill iced tea, refill my water glass or remove dirty plates.  The room is very modern and I sat at a window table on the side and enjoyed watching the folks below who were coming back from the pool.

One of my better steak experiences in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for Thanksgiving dinner since the wait for Studio B was 4 to 5 hours! 

Basically the upscale steak restaurant for the casino with all the typical upscale steak house apps, etrees, and desserts. For Thanksgiving, they had a prix fixe menu for $45/person. 

The place was pretty packed, since it was the holidays. Only two, in our party of five, ordered the special Thanksgiving dinner. The grilled mahi mahi, prime rib, and lobster ravioli were the other entrees ordered. A spinach salad and shrimp cocktail were the a la cart appetizers we ordered. 

The prix fixe menu included choice of french onion soup or some squash soup, turkey with stuffing, and a choice of a dessert. There were no complaints for any of the dishes and the serving size of the turkey was enough for two. The shrimp cocktail consisted of three extremely large shrimp, at least 21/25, and a host of condiments. I thought the serving dish was a little too large for the three shrimps, but that is an easy mistake to overlook. The spinach salad (my app), was just the way I liked it, not too much dressing, with the flavors of the ingredients coming through. The grilled mahi mahi was cooked nicely, not dry and not too greasy. The mango chutney also complimented the fish and rice nicely. My brothers had no complaints of the prime rib or lobster ravioli. Overall, the food was average to above average for an upscale steak restaurant.

What brought down the overall rating was the service. When I eat at an upscale restaurant, I expect the quality of service to match the quality of food. We rarely saw or heard from our server. Granted it was busy, but the restaurant is supposed to be able to handle that, or else why put in so many tables/seats. My ice tea was refilled three times over the course of an hour. Many times, my request for more ice tea had to be repeated. 

It is a shame the service at this restaurant could not be better. From the other reviews, the happy hour sounds pretty good, but I don't think I would come back for non-happy hour meals."}
{"text":"Sirloin, rib-eye and filet mignon were okay. I was a fan of the reduction, peppercorn, and bearnaise sauce more than the seasoning of the steak...and it didn't melt in my mouth :( Maybe it was a bad day for this establishment. King crab legs lacked seasoning. 

Only highlight for me was the lobster bisque and tater tots.

Decent wine selection. 

Also, complimentary chocolate covered strawberries for people celebrating birthdays so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Great food great service good value. Great place for a date night. Ive been there more times than I can count because of the consistent quality and service. Best off strip steak house around. Wish I could say the same for the casino."}
{"text":"We accidentally ended up at Anthony's lastnight.  We didn't yelp first which we normally do. 

We weer not disappointed by the food which was phenomenal. But we were a bit surprised with the top of the strip prices at am off the strip location. 

We both had prime rib which couldn't have been Amy better.  It melted like butter in your mouth. The yuckon mashed potatoes wete delish. The creamed corn just may be the best.  I was surprised they use a mild watery creamed horseradish, I prefer fresh ground horseradish with a bite. 

The service was perfect or glasses were never less than half full.  The waiter seated me and placed my napkin on my lap.  The bus boy used a scraper to clean the crumbs for the table cloth. Oh and for a nearby diner with a child they went to another establishment in the casino to get the child a pizza which he would eat. 

I highly recommend this place but be prepared for a large check at the end."}
{"text":"Anthony's is a great option if you're craving steakhouse and live near the M casino. Restaurant looks like a great size, plenty of tables, not too close to neighboring tables. 

Service is friendly, with a smile. I never had to wait and seated right away. 

Menu is what you typically find in a steakhouse. I have not tried the king crab legs yet, but will try next visit. 

I do not like walking into M, smells very heavy with smoke. Disgusting. 

Reason I do not dine at Anthony's, I do not like the air quality in casino."}
{"text":"OMG!!! They deserve all the praises!! Hands down the best steakhouse EVER!!! Among all the steakhouses that I have been to so, I have never had such delicious steak!! We ordered dry aged ribeye, ny steak, beat salad with crab meat and pork belly and potato cutlets!! Meat was so tender, juicy, and unbelievably delicious!! Crab meat was big lumps and was really fresh!!! It was a fantastic dinner! They are pricy but worth every penny!!! If you want to try the best steak in town, this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Awful service.  We counted up to 8 minutes between checks from waiter Tony. Even then it was a quick stop. Prime Rib was cold. Didn't want to wait another 8 minutes to get the waiter to return and replace.  We even put glasses at the end of the table as a hint we needed a refill. No visible manager which was disappointing as well. We dine out a lot and usually a manager stops to check on the tables. For a very pricey meal we were very disappointed. A lot of training is needed. He said they are the only restaurant that serves bone-in filets which is incorrect. I usually scout out restaurants for bone-in because they are much tastier.  And yes there are other steakhouses that have dry aged vs prime.  Not sure it was worth the additional $20 for the prime. We ordered both to try out.  Shrimp cocktail is only 3 large shrimps.  Side dishes serve 3. Appreciate the other reviewers which helped us to make our choices."}
{"text":"This restaurant located in the M Resort and Spa.  Our Waiter was entertaining and helpful with our choices for dinner.  Ordered the Chilean Seabass that was sooooooo delicious.  Prime Rib and Rib-eye at our table was also a big hit.  Highly recommend this restaurant for a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time Tuesday night to celebrate my birthday, it was supposed to be me and my husband's birthday as we are both in June.  Anyway, it was fantastic! the food, the service, everything.  I cannot wait to go back.  Our waiter was Fabio.  He is so nice!   He was so on top of things, answered all questions, checked in on us enough to be great but not over bearing.  He wished me a happy birthday several times.

Appetizer, we split a tomato /mozzarella salad..... definitlely is big enough for 2 people to share.   The drinks were very good.  I had a Sangria and it was one of the best I had.  My friend had 2 Cosmo's and she liked them.

Bread, they bring a nice variety with butter.  Flatbreads and some regular different varieties.

Main Course, I got the Bone in Filet, its bigger than the 9 oz but not much and very good! for ten dollars more I say to get that for 52.00 rather than the 9 0z for 42.00

My friend got the bone in rib eye, her's definitely had more flavor than the filet as rib eyes usually do but both were excellent!! I recommend either one 

Sides, we had the homemade fries.... they tasted homemade too and were very good.
We also got the zesty lemon Asparagus --- they were very very big and tasty.

I complimented my steak with a grilled shrimp.  It was a nice size and the waiter said I should have the head of it chopped off if I never saw a shrimp that way so that was the way I went :)

For dessert - we had enjoyed a complimentary birthday one of chocolate covered strawberries and some seasonal berries on the side ( see photo) and on a piece of white chocolate, it said Happy Birthday.  They were delicious.

I will return to Anthony's again, the prices are similar to going to Ruth Chris, I would say and the food is great!  Also, the restaurant is very pretty and has an outdoor area with a nice view."}
{"text":"We are a bunch of locals and works in the industry, loves good food and drinks. We came here to check out their promo for Blue Label. The bar tender Michelle was short and ufriendly. We weren't expecting anything out of the ordinary but at least be cordial and basic customer service skills. We weren't dressed to the nines so she probably assumed we didn't have money. I jad my phone oit and mentioned im going to write yelp review. They probably heard that comment and her attitude changed. She started talking to us and asked questions but a little too late. We paid and despite the poor service we still tipped her well. She got nice towards the end because of those reasons (getting yelped and she saw the tip) not because it's part of her job. How does.she expect to build local clientele who spend$ money and tip her well?"}
{"text":"I took my brother and his girlfriend to the M because he was in town visiting and on his way back out of town a few hours later. we landed at Anthony's after debate between the steakhouse and the Italian place, we chose Anthony's 

I dont think this review will be very long, because I feel I should just get to the bad points and the good points.

The Good Points;

The Oysters Rockefeller were pretty good, I liked the bed of sea-salt and herbs they were laid on..

The Caesar Salads looked pretty good that my brother and his girlfriend ordered, and they didn't complain about them being bad.

My Prime Rib Cut seemed to be a lot more then 12 ounces. 

The Bad Points.

Prime Rib seemed tough, even when cooked at rare-medium rare temperatures.

If you love water, you'll love their French Onion Soup! absolutely no flavor at all. None.

The waiter, Fabio, needs a severe attitude adjustment, his words may sound nice but once those stop his facial expressions and anger come out.. he snubbed us after we needed to pay separate checks after we were sat down. And when observing him deal with other people his eyes rolled once they completed their requests. when it was time to pay he rudely asked if I was ready to pay. I find it very very sad that he makes great money at a great place and hates it there. maybe this will serve as a wake-up call to him and he'll straighten himself out. 

One star off for the soup, and one star off for Fabio's attitude. 

I'd give this place another shot if the chance allowed, however I don't think I'd be too happy if the Fabulous Fabio was our waiter again."}
{"text":"\"Fabulous and accommodating\"

Whether it is a small dinner for two or a dinner for 14 in a private room at Anthony's at the \"M\" in Henderson, we've never been disappointed. The food was fabulous and the service impeccable. They make a bison steak that melts in your mouth and their lobster bisque is rich and creamy. They serve items a la cart, so you have a variety of items from which to choose. If you want to be away from the chaos on the Strip, head over to Henderson for a top-shelf dining experience."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fancy steak restaurant, then go here. Went here a while back for an event and hands down it was a good experience, enjoyed the atmosphere inside the restaurant and the view of their kitchen while the chef cooks for you, very delicious and fancy. They also have a balcony outside with tables, just make sure to call ahead since they are busy."}
{"text":"Wow I was amazed by how good the steak  really was even the seafood so fresh ,appetizers , good atmosphere is really nice people working there my  favorite waiter , Bruno and Frank the manager A real gentleman"}
{"text":"I have made this statement before, in some of my other steakhouse restaurant reviews, but it is worth repeating here: \"In my opinion, Las Vegas has the most great steakhouse resturants, per square mile, then any other city in the world (and keep in mind, I lived 35 years in the NYC area, and traveled all over the world, so I know what I am talking about)\". That being said, Anthony's is another fantastic steakhouse that Vegas has to offer. Anthony's steaks were seasoned and cooked to perfection, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the prices were very reasonable (when you compare the prices to other upper end Vegas steakhouses). If your looking for a great steak dinner, Anthony's should definitely be on your list to consider."}
{"text":"My Wife and I made dinner reservations at Anthony's for a date night out at 5:30. Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and seated promptly. Throughout our dining experience Everything was exceptional!  
      Our Waiter...Derrick was very helpful and knowledgeable with our menu selections. Continually we experienced very prompt, well timed and Attentive service with the help of also Angel and Jose the support staff. Thank You gentlemen for making our evening certainly one to remember!
      The ambiance...was pleasant as it has a very open concept with Windows and a balcony overlooking the pool. We especially enjoyed the charming and cozy two person booths for comfort.
      The Food...was all excellent with a preference for the chopped salad which was so finely chopped and easy to eat, just the right balance or sweetness in the dressing! To drink my wife had the \"Stubborn Mule\" cocktail (a recommendation from our waiter Derrick) which she loved by the way along with a JW Blue Neat. Probably the Highlight of my night was the 18oz Bone-in Dry Aged Filet! Wow this was perfectly cooked and seasoned and had such a fine flavor and texture! My Wife found delightful her Roasted Chicken dish with steamed Artichokes and fresh Olives. For sides we enjoyed the baked potato, giant asparagus, and scalloped potatoes (definitely our favorite!) and all were delicious and good for sharing!
     Next the final course, Dessert! Which our server Derrick prepared us for in advance because their signature chocolate souffle takes longer to prepare then most desserts but he had this timed perfectly for us to arrive just in time along with the Peanut butter Pie. Both were so rich and flavorful! Hats off to the Chef on the Filet and Souffle! We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"We had a great overall experience for dinner last night. We are at the M for a conference and decided to check if out for dinner. The ambiance and decor are on point. You can actually request to sit with a view of the kitchen and watch them cook your steak. Appetizers-crab cakes and fried scallops were amazing. My husband and I both ordered the bone-in filet, which melted in my mouth. Mine was cooked medium well since I am pregnant and was actually more tender than my husband's medium rare. The sides were the only disappointment. We had the creamed corn, which was good, but nothing amazing.  We also had the tater tots, but we were not impressed. For a high end steakhouse, they definitely need to work on improving their side dishes. Overall, we would eat here again."}
{"text":"Ahi Tuna at a Steakhouse?  You bet, and boy was it excellent!  Prepared just right to my specifications like I know they do steaks!  I was there with a very large party, so between all of us, most of the major menu items were ordered.  No one, and I mean NO ONE had anything but rave reviews for their food.  Located inside the M Resort, this place makes the trip to Henderson worthwhile.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our great meal was a great start to an overall great evening at The M. We had a party to attend at the wine bar so we decided it was a good time to try Anthony's. First, it's so easy to get to this restaurant because The M is off strip and that makes parking and traffic very low key. We made a reservation for a Friday evening, but I'm not sure we really needed one because they weren't overly busy. 

We didn't start with drinks this evening since we were on our way to the wine bar. The lobster tacos were calling my husband's name so we started with those and they definitely didn't disappoint. Three came on the plate which was perfect since we had a friend from out of town with us as well. For dinner my friend and I had filet mignons and my husband had the sole with a butter sauce. All of our entrees were perfectly prepared and flavorful. We shared brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes which were also very good and full of flavor. We all enjoyed our own desserts and none of them disappointed. The desserts came in generous portions as well.

Overall, we found this restaurant to be a win. We were impressed by the ambiance and food. it doesn't hurt that it seemed to be a little less expensive than similar restaurants on the strip and closer to home."}
{"text":"AMAZING MENU, FOOD & SERVICE!!!

We stopped in for a business dinner and got a private room in the rear of the restaurant.  It was nice a quiet and  great way to have service and space to ourselves.

The staff was prompt, attentive, knowledgeable of the menu and remembered what each member of our 20-person group was drinking, down to exactly which wine to pout which person!

The menu was one of the BEST I've EVER seen at a chophouse - AMAZING selections and unique items, it was truly an exciting menu to peruse and made it tough to find just one thing to try!

The food was prepared PERFECTLY!  Steaks tasted like grass-fed and truly perfectly butchered beef.  The seafood was VERY fresh and prepared perfectly.  The plating was OUTSTANDING!  You've got to see the pix of the various items we ordered - amazing!

Overall, this was one of the BEST steaks I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"We went to Anthony's tonight for my husbands birthday.  We were expecting the same great service as our first experience.  Sorry to say....service was not good.  Nothing at all like before.  Food was amazing....but WOW!  We were shocked.  Sad!"}
{"text":"This one is tricky, because it's a gourmet restaurant with a wide variety of steak and seafood.  You should definitely take extra time to review the entire menu as to order what you really like.  The most expensive item is not necessarily the best item for your personal pallet.  For me, it was the crab legs and tater tots.  Massive swol succulent crustacean limbs from the salty sea paired with handcrafted crispalicious amazingly seasoned tater tots...  the best tater tots on planet earth as far as I'm concerned.  These tots are about 2 inches wide and 1 inch thic.  The good kind of thicc lol.  Anyway, those crab legs had perfect texture and flavor.  They were so good that the 8 oz fillet underneath them seemed like a garnish lol... The staff had a warm and welcoming attitude and I left fat dumb and happy... and drunk"}
{"text":"This restaurant was really nice and had a great staff! I'm deducting a star only because there was something wrong with everyone's dish. My salmon and crab cakes were too salty, and the rest of my party's steak was overlooked based on their liking, also our Brussels sprouts came very hard and burnt. But other than that our creamed corn, mashed potatoes, calamari, etc were great!"}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner Saturday evening ( 5:30 PM). I had the bone in Rib Eye, my girlfriend, the Prime Rib....Along with a couple of sides.
Everything was perfect.  The service was excellent, although we were brought a wrong order, it was fixed immediately......
I only gave 4 stars because I wish they offered a better wine list by the glass. That part continues to be a disappointment....Atmosphere is very nice.

I'm a local who has lived here for over 20 years. This was probably my 4th or 5th time eating here since they opened almost 10 years ago. Other then the wine I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a fairly solid steakhouse in a nice off-strip location.  I don't think the cuts are as lights-out as some of the other joints on the strip, but the prices here reflect that, in my opinion. Nice interior.  I've been here a few times and the place never seems busy."}
{"text":"Anthony's at the M Resort served me the BEST CRAB LEGS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!! That's my review, for the Crab Legs. Ok the service was good too (yes its pricey) I went with 2 people and the bill was .... well, I'm glad I was treated and did not have to pay. DID I SAY they served THE BEST CRAB LEGS I'V EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE (and I'm a big crab leg fan)."}
{"text":"Had a great meal BUT a horrid server, black male-forgot the name, who never checked on us. My beer was gone during the appetizer and then at the end of my entree he asked would I like another beer. Let me just say his tip reflected the service. I had the fillet mignon and my friend had the Ahi. I just hate how a dumb inattentive server can ruin a fine meal. I still gave the four stars based on the food."}
{"text":"Out of had delicious.  Oysters, Buffalo Steak, Scotch.  All fantastic.  Drive here.  Casino smoke abatement system makes it seem smoke free.  Really cool.  Bring a fat wallet $$$$ & plan to enjoy yourself.  It won't be enjoyable if u r on a budget."}
{"text":"Can't really complain about the food. It was good. Service was as good as you would expect. For the $$$ go to Gordon Ramsay steak or del Frisco."}
{"text":"Excellent food and much more quiet atmosphere than steakhouses on the strip. Highly recommend and then hit the wine cellar."}
{"text":"This place is has by far the best filet mignon and rib eye I have tasted!
My manager and I came here to take a friend to dinner and we were spoiled! 
The staff was charming, presentable and knowledgable about what they had to offer as well as recommendations.
For appetizers - we ordered the bacon wrapped dates (which was the first time we've tried anything so creative). The sweetness of the dates and the juicy smoked flavor of the bacon complimented each other well and were amazing to start! For sides we had ordered the sweet potato with a glaze and sweet creamed corn. The softness of the sweet potato was amazing - cutting through it was like a piece of cake and just one bite melted in your mouth instantly! The sweet creamed corn was to die for - a must have for sides. The sweetness was just right and the creamy sauce reminded me of cream of mushroom soup - fulfilling and delightful :) 
For the entrees, the waiter had recommended that their steaks were the best in the country - we decided to have the filet mignon (wet dry- where the meat is vacuum sealed to retain moisture), bone in rib eye (dry age- where the meat is air aged) and bone in filet mignon. All though the dry age meats had more flavor and were delicious - all three meats were tender and aged to perfection. The cuts were smooth and fresh. 
After this amazing feast - the waiter was able to sneak in their chocolate soufflé and some hot tea and coffee. The soufflé was a lovely way to end the night - the flavor reminded me of a warm milk chocolate with little dots of chocolate inside. 
To summarize my dinner - the presentation, staff and food was phenomenal. I would recommend Anthony's Steakhouse for any occasion :)"}
{"text":"Thank god I live only minutes from this place. By far my favorite steak house. The bone in filet is the most amazing steak I've ever had. All of the side are great and I've had them all."}
{"text":"They service is great and very thoughtfulness and very comfortable restaurant. Food is great, except green beans which is side menu. I think steak is too salty for me,but very tender and juicy. 
And their peanut butter pie is amazing actually very big dessert but my husband who's peanut butter lover says delicious all the time;) 
One day We went to eat just desserts at Bar area,but bartender lady who's Hispanic isn't great service. She is disagreeable. So We felt uncomfortable. And chocolate soufflé is just OK. I like restaurant area but bar area is just OK or less. That's too bad."}
{"text":"Loved the patio and ambiance. The steak and salmon were a bit on the salty side, but I'm a fan of salt so it didn't bother me. Great wedge and loved the scallops potatoes. I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard steak definitely good but nothing to brag about.  For the money there are definitely better places to go on the strip but for the area it's not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Nice place but the quality of the food is not equivalent to the price. The service was mediocre. I would not return. The food and service would be compare to Outback."}
{"text":"Choose Marnells Cut Steak..and Creamed Corn...this is is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best steak in Vegas! They have a wonderful wine selection to go with your meal. The staff is fast and friendly and knowledgable. I recommend the filet which is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Best meat I ever had so far! Wonderful dining. And the service was also perfect! 
The prices are as normal as in Germany. So for that Quality and that service it was an perfect evening!
Thanks you do an wonderful job!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Was not a fan of the Ahi Tuna app, but everything else was delicious."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque and lobster risotto, catch the theme here?  Great food and lots of fun with the group."}
{"text":"We had an interesting experience here.  Our server was Doug and he was great.  He was personable and knowledgeable.  His assistants were useless as was the manager to a certain point.  A busser dropped a full glass of ice water right next to our table of 6. It literally exploded, shattering glass and water on our clothes.  NOT ONE PERSON came over to ask if we were OK.  They just swept it all up, and that was that.  I had to call over the busser to get the glass under our table. I look over through the clear walls and the manager glances over in our direction, then just stands there still leaning on the counter chatting with a server.  Doug was running around and the \"assistants\" were setting a table that left 30 minutes ago.  All of our appetizers had been eaten, our wine was finished, and we had a full table of dirty dishes and all empty water glasses.  We didn't mind waiting for our dinner given such a beautiful environment, but now it was uncomfortable with a filthy table, and still stepping on pieces of glass.  So, since the manager is still not doing anything I approach him.  I say, \"excuse me, \" as he looks directly at my chest instead of my eyes (he's lucky he didn't get smacked) and I explain to him that since there are supposed to be 4 people (server, manager, and 2 assistants,) giving my table attention yet we have no water or wine left in our glasses, and a table of dirty dishes.  He apologizes and waves for people that are busy with other things to come help him clear the table.  We ask him for more water, he says, \"I'll be back immediately with that.\" He forgot and went back to holding up that hostess stand. We asked one of the assistants for more water, and it was like we asked her for a kidney.  No smile, no pleasant answer.  Just a deep breathe and an attitude.  If she would've just told me where it was I would've done it myself. Doug came back and apologized up and down about everything.  He was as sweet as could be.  He then noticed our water all gone and grabbed the pitcher immediately. To make amends with us, even though it wasn't his fault, he showered us with desserts after our incredible meal. Being an Italian family we wanted specific things but we were totally OK with not getting them, laughing and joking with Doug.  Doug went above and beyond and went to the Italian restaurant to grab us cannolies!  Very thoughtful! The food was so amazing it was breathtaking. We all absolutely LOVED the food!  And the efforts he made with dessert were so incredibly appreciative. However, if we had to choose between better service or complimentary dessert, we would've chosen the service. We are locals, and I don't know if we'll bring our families in town back here, but if we did, we would request Doug."}
{"text":"A casino so elegant, that you swear that you've finally arrived! Tony Marnell's new creation (post-Rio) has all the design elements that must be appreciated knowing he's one of the great casino designers, and his restaurants contribute in terms of ambience and great food. We enjoyed it immensely. We highly recommend this place if you just want to get off the strip and enjoy the extra value that beauty and aesthetics provide. Plus the machines are loose! We enjoyed dinner with Tony's son having dinner next to us with Mike Tyson and his friends. Still a Las Vegas secret, but not for long!"}
{"text":"Had the bone in filet mignon with mushrooms and creamed spinach.  Service was good and food was excellent.  Cab fare from the strip was $40 so you have added pressure to win at the tables to make up for the cost!"}
{"text":"I really really REALLY wanted to be able to say this place was amazing but...sadly, no...it's not. 
     This side of town is a bit far for me but if it wasn't for my office's Holiday Party I would have never come. The ambience and is beautiful and tranquil...very fancy (^_^) We had a private room and chef with a menu that included a seared Tuna appetizer, Caesar salad, and choice of Sea Bass, Surf & Turf or Chicken. The Seared Tuna was deeeelicious! The Caesar salad was a bit salty for me personally...the sheets of parmasean may have been a bit much for my liking as well. But where these two were robust in flavor the Surf and Turf I ordered for the entrée lacked flavor. The Steak was med rare, very dry and gamey like freshly hunted meat that hasn't been properly cleaned...idk maybe that's the flavor they were aiming for. Nothing a crap ton of lemon and pepper couldn't fix. The lobster was tough almost rubbery...the butter and lemon juice couldn't even help that texture. The \"community sides\" they brought were very good...I filled myself up mostly on these since my entree was so lackluster...mashed potatoes, some sort of veggie side, and string beans. Very good. 
     The presentation was exquisite and lead me to believe that the flavor would be as just. But I was a little disappointed where they dropped the ball on the flavor and texture and were more concerned of the presentation. I will try this place again but outside of a company event just to give it that second shot. I'm sure there is something I have to be missing. This place can't be that bad! Maybe the chef had a long day?! 
     PS...The deserts weren't very good. We took them to go and met at a different location to enjoy them. I think the only ones our office liked were the macaroons all the others were not memorable or very yuck."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite places in Vegas!  Our waiter, Derek, was knowledgable and very personable.  The food was elegant and well prepared.  The swordfish was so good, I don't know how to explain it. Well seared, moist, sitting in a bed of mushrooms and a delicious purée. Others had the sea bass and said it melted in their mouths.  Also, it was quiet and easy to have a conversation.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"As you all know, Vegas has tons of steak houses so it is tough to say one is greater than another.....this place rocks!

1.  Ambiance - typical M style open environment with tall ceilings. Not intimate yet nice feeling regardless

2.  Parking - you are in a casino resort so be prepared forth normal walk and navigation through a smokey casino. 

3. Service -  I would say near or at the top of the class. From the reception to the server to the table bus position, I found all to just right. 

4.  Food -  wow!  Had the bone in filet mignon. First time to try a bone in filet. This was a very thick cut and I had it media, rare. It was just right throughout the entire cut. I wonder how they do it without butterflying the filet???  For the table, we also had the ribeye and this was not their prime cut bone in, yet it was tasty. Also had the Ahi tuna, asparagus,scalloped potatoes and wild mushrooms. Everything was perfect!

5.  Wine list - great selection of California wines, italians and even some French, Australians and Chilean!  Some were very expensive yet even the reasonably priced   Malbec was nice

Some of the best steaks I tried with the right atmosphere so I say, check this place for sure"}
{"text":"If you want a good steak spot off the main strip this is a great place. I have come here time and time again I often order the bone in ribeye med-rare and it always comes out exactly how I order it!! That's what I call consistency, when it comes to steak specially at restaurants sometimes they either under cook it or over cook it happy to say that every time I have come here the steak I order have been delicious and cooked properly. Would recommend for special occasions since price is a bit on the higher side. If you go and like mushrooms I recommend the wild mushroom selection sautéed and a bone in ribeye, that's what I call a great meal!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place is so highly rated. The M casino is beautiful, there's beautiful views of the strip from here, but I left here feeling very underwhelmed.

The food is highly priced. An order of shrimp cocktail is $18 and has 3 pieces of shrimp. That's $6 per shrimp. I don't care how good that shrimp is, but $6 for one? Soups are about $11 for a mediocre size bowl. I can go on and on about everything I ordered, but I think I've said enough.

I've been to the steakhouse at the Silverton, their creamed corn is to die for. Here at Anthony's, we barely touched it. The steak at Red Rock, I still can't forget how the beef melted in my mouth. Eating the steak here, I felt it was tender but I could make it myself at home. Out of all the steakhouses, this one is on the bottom. BUT it was the most expensive. We ordered 4 appetizers, 2 soups, 2 different steaks, lobster, sea bass, and 3 sides. The best thing I had on the menu was the scalloped potatoes and that's a side dish. That's sad.

Needlessly to say, I will not be back. Not worth the price at all. Service was whatever for such an upscale restaurant. Our bread came out late and was cold. I still think the M casino is beautiful and might be back for drinks and the view but will probably never eat here again. Way too overpriced. I left here angry that I spent so much and was so unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This was a very solid meal, and better than when we went back when it was Terzetto's (sp?).  I had the crab cakes to start, which were nothing to write home about, but fine.  We shared a shrimp cocktail.  This comes with 3 large shrimp that were prepared well and typical cocktail sauce, with extra horse radish if you so choose.  This was a nice touch, we could have used more actually.  The shrimp was a nice starter.  My wife had the prosciutto salad, which was good and a nice size.

The real stars were the steaks.  I had the bone-in ribeye and my wife had the bone-in filet.  Both were cooked perfectly (mine to medium rare and hers to rare) and very flavorful.  They are both (according to the menu) dry aged, and the taste was there for a dry aged steak.  Our table shared the scalloped potatoes, mushroom mix, spinach, and green beans as sides.  Of these, all agreed the potatoes and spinach stood out.  The green beans were good, but very basic.  

The wine list is not impressive, but VERY reasonable as far as pricing goes.  This is particularly true of the after dinner drinks.  Our server was very knowledgeable regarding the wine list.  Service was attentive but not overbearing.  We live in Henderson and will return."}
{"text":"So I stayed at the M Resort for 3 nights & guess were I ate dinner those 3 nights.....Anthony's! In those 3 nights I've had the 22oz Rib-Eye, 24oz Porterhouse, and the I forget the oz Bone in filet. I've also had the Alaskan King Crabs, green beans, scallops, cream of corn, & strawberry shortcake, Everything was fantastic! Wait staff was great, nice atmosphere and never a wait. The only downside was I spent more money on the food than I did on the rooms"}
{"text":"My son and I shared the 10 oz lobster tail - not up to the standards we're used to from somewhere like Morton's or Ruth's Chris, we also shared the 9 oz filet ( not bone-in so it wasn't the prime cut) we had asked for it butterflied cooked medium and it was very rare, and not very hot when served. My wife had the roast chicken which was on the dry side. The ambiance was very nice and they have an outside eating area. Service is generally good although the food took a while to come out. This restaurant is inside the M Resort."}
{"text":"This is our local restaurant it's only about a half-mile from our house as the crow flies. It's in the M resort which is my favorite casino. Anthony's prime steak is an excellent restaurant food is great Service is excellent atmosphere is also wonderful my tip try the oysters."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I ordered the 18 oz. bone in filet as recommended by our waiter versus 8 oz., medium. When the filet arrived, I thought to myself \"where is the beef?\". Beef was on one side of the small bone. I expected an 18 oz. to have beef on both sides of the bone. I suspect the total weight was at most 10 oz. It arrived cooked rare vesus medium ordered. The lobster tail was luke warm with cold melted butter.

The tasteless bread basket tasted a bit stale, 1 day old with no taste!

Stay away from the sides. The tater tots that our waiter recommended were almost burned. The mac and cheese was worst that gthe box style you get in the store. noodles were well done.

I decided not to complain since we were being taken out by someone else.

We will not go back."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for 24 hours.  Enough time for dinner and breakfast. Ate here for both meals, sadly I was disappointed with service and quality of food for both. It was on the same par as banquet food. The café/ grill on the casino floor where you order at the counter, had far better food."}
{"text":"I haven't had steak this good for awhile.  It's a little slow, both times I've been in, to get started (like it takes awhile for them to come and take your drink order, but after that it's normal speed). Everything comes separately - so you need to order a side or an app or whatever (so it's expensive, but SO worth it).  But everything has been amazing.  I came back a second night because I wanted the bison tomahawk steak I had last night.  They were out (I got here at 9pm) so I just said give me the best steak then, and boy did Edward deliver.  I had a grass fed tazmanian bison filet and it was also incredible.  Totally different than the bone-in ribeye, but an amazing meat quality, and once again they didn't ruin the flavor of the meat with a ton of spices.  They DID, however, have a lovely mushroom sauce around it, but not touching it, so you could sample as you pleased.  I'm so happy right now.  It's in the M hotel, BTW.  And Kesha will be here Sept 16."}
{"text":"Came here to eat with my hubby and loved it. 

Foie Gras: Excellent! Loved the fruit compote it came with and the brioche

French Onion Soup: Perfectly seasoned

Raw Oysters on a 1/2 Shell: So delicious. Fanny Bay & Kumamoto was very fresh

Prime Filet Carpaccio: Just Ok. I've had better. It definitely lacked seasoning. Maybe some capers and aioli could've made it taste less bland

Creamed Corn: Very Yummy. Perfectly seasoned and very fresh

Potato Croquette: Very bland. Could use some seasoning or dip

Porterhouse: Very good

Bone In Filet Mignon: Saw great reviews on this so had  try it even  tho I'm more of a Ribeye lover. It was very lean and tender. 

Strawberry Shortcake: Delicious!!"}
{"text":"The service was fair. The food was very good. I had the beef short ribs, my husband had the rib eye and mashed potatoes and my dad had the salmon and side of macaroni and cheese. We all cleared our plates, delicious and the view, super!"}
{"text":"I decided on this place for an early dinner because the price point in another website indicated it a little lower than Yelp's.  That was definitely incorrect, as we weren't looking for a restaurant at this price point.  Don't get me wrong, the meals and service are worth the price.  All items were ala carte.  My wife had the lamb, and I the prime rib.  Both were excellent.  The waiter suggested we share the side.  Not heeding, my wife ordered the Yukon mashed potatoes and I had the mushrooms.  All were excellent and generous, so much that we had to pass on dessert that we had planned on.  The only disappointment was the wine.  We both ordered cabernet.  At $14.00 a glass, it was considerably more tannic than normal."}
{"text":"I'm born and raised in Vegas and have been going to different steak house for many years.  This one has manager to become my favorite.  Besides the extraordinary food and service.  They offer a amazing view of Las Vegas, a great happy hour and you can get regular steak or you can get a steak from one of the ranch meats from the owners farm.  It's always a great experience here and they also have a great happy hour for those who just want to \"belly up\" to the bar and chill there with a awesome bartender and the games in tvs.  If your a steak house person then this place is a must do..."}
{"text":"Half-price appetizers in the bar during 5-7pm Happy Hour! Yes, half price is still $6-8 a plate, which made us a little skeptical, but these appetizers are honkers, i.e. generous servings. Service was impeccable, especially given that we were seated in the bar and eating the \"cheap\" stuff. 

The bread basket is notable, although the bread wasn't warm, it was tasty, and their butter is tasty. I love a nice, smeary butter. Between the two of us, we sampled the calamari, chopped salad, wedge salad and a bowl of clam chowder. I have no complaints. Every dish was executed well, and we had no problem eating every bite. The calamari was similar to a salt and pepper style, terrific! Both salads were fresh and topped with quality dressings. And, the bowl of chowder left my husband pondering, \"Legal, who?\"

One other thing, this place is huge! If you're looking to have a steak party with 20 of your closest friends, they can accommodate. 

Good eats, happy hour prices, and a nice atmosphere-- it's worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is terrific.  From 5-7 pm daily wine list selections discounted 33% and appetizers 50%. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. Service by Mario, Anthony & Jose was impeccable. Atmosphere was comfortable elegance with comfortable seating, tasteful background music with tablecloth covered table and proper glassware for both wine and cocktails. We are locals and we will be back."}
{"text":"First off, this place is freezing cold.  Not only did we ask about it but when you look around the restaurant there are patrons with jackets draped around them.  They were unable to adjust the the temperatures .  The service was average at best.  Empty glasses and plates were left at the table while our server and assistant played \"grab ass\" next to us. Food was very good!   Had salmon and fillet.   Just disappointed with rest of experience, especially when paying this kind of money for the experience.  Would have rather dined at Hanks!"}
{"text":"I had the filet mignon =amazing. I seriously could cut it with a butter  knife ! It was divine! My husband had the ribeye , which he enjoyed very much . Lovely service . The side dishes  we got for the table of 4 (spinach, scalloped potatoes, asparagus and mushrooms) were delicious and well prepared . Only negative : The chopped salad was too big, too chopped up and had too much vinegarette, in my opinion . My husband had the lobster bisque and he said it was delicious. Nice wine selection , we had a Cabernet from Franciscan. No dessert , after an amazing steak like that , there's no room!"}
{"text":"Wow one of the faves that's off the strip... We tried majority of the main courses. I would have to say that the crab legs was the best part. Really good and it comes with different sauces. Juicy. Soft. Tasty. Lamb was great, fish was drizzled with furikake nori (definitely ordering that again) and the steak was on point medium. Too bad they didn't have white rice for me to eat with the fish but the smashed potatoes suffice."}
{"text":"This place is the best restaurant I've ever eaten at in Las Vegas. The highest level of service you can imagine!  Their Wedge salad is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I love this locals spot! I work in a high end restaurant on the strip, so I expect good service & decent food. This place hasn't disappointed me yet! No less than 8 times & every visit is enjoyable in every way! The wedge is amazing & the bone in filet is DELISH!"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Had the prime rib which was cooked perfectly.  Also had the green beans with almonds which was very good also.  Will be back.  Staff was professional and courteous.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great appetizers, food and service. Nice wine list with 1/3 off bottles tonight. Will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, ambiance, and service.  The Jumbo Sea Scallop appetizer is to die for, honestly in a different league than any of the scallops I've tasted at the celebrity chef restaurants on the strip.  The plate comes dressed with an apricot glalze, charred corn ragout, and almond foam.  It doesn't matter how you dress those delicious buttery scallops, they're perfect on their own.  This dish is one of my top ten most tasty appetizers in all of Vegas dining choices.

The service is spectacular.  Our server was perfectly on point all night, paying attention to every little detail.  I wish I could remember his name so I could ask for him next time.  Anyhow, bf and I both ordered the Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye at a medium rare temp.  Mine came out medium well and his came out close to rare.  I'm not sure how this happened, but our server noticed and resolved it before it could become an issue."}
{"text":"My sister and I went last Friday night before catching the Comedy Club. We were seated in front of the grill and enjoyed the kitchen show. Though it wasn't crowded at 6:30 p.m., it took a while for our server to show up and take our drink order. He was very personable. My sister ordered wine and I ordered coffee when our entire order was taken. She had the lobster bisque--which she said was delicious and had 4 nice size pieces of lobster. I had the Caesar salad that was a little overdressed, but also tasty. The wine showed up, but my coffee did not. When the water glass was refilled, I asked the server to get the waiter to ask him where the coffee was. This server was very accommodating and got my coffee and said he was sorry and not to worry as he would check up on me to make sure I had enough coffee. I never saw him again! My sister ordered the Seafood Louie as a main meal with a side of asparagus. She really enjoyed both. I ordered the prime rib with a side of wild mushrooms. The prime rib was fatty and a bit dry--like a previous comment--I wish I had ordered the Rib Eye. But the wild mushrooms was delicious. I finished the one cup of coffee and the water and tried to catch the eye of any of the servers. They were moving around fast and no one stopped by to see if we needed anything. I guess the manager noticed we were just sitting there waiting and he stopped by to see what we needed. We asked for boxes to take home the leftovers and I mentioned my coffee, which was refilled. We slowly finished our drinks as it took another 10 minutes for our original waiter to stop by, when we asked for the check. For the price we paid--$118 plus tip--it was a little disappointing, mainly because of the lack of service, but I really enjoyed the atmosphere and my sister really enjoyed her food."}
{"text":"We had heard that this restaurant was worth a visit. We were going to the night time pool concert so we thought we would make it a date night and have a nice dinner 1st. 
For a steak house we were happy. It was definitely worth the visit. 
My man had the prime rib eye and I had the filet Oscar style.  To start we had half salads. He had the chopped and I had the bibb salad. They were both wonderful but mine was the best! :) it was packed full of fresh veggies and the tarragon dressing was delicious!
For the sides we shared mac.n.cheese which was pretty decent. I keep trying mac.n.cheese at different places and I am just never satisfied. I feel like the creaminess is there with this one but the true cheesiness is missing. We also ordered something that my man said he felt odd ordering because we were at such a nice place but he really wanted them...tater tots it was! But let me tell you...I would go back for those alone! Lol!!! They were homemade deliciousness...huge! Tasted like a scalloped potatoe with crispiness!!! We were so excited! 
My filet was delicious, perfectly cooked, huge pieces of crab on top, the perfect amount of hollandaise sauce on top with 2 tree like asparagus stems! 
Our waiter was great. The price was almost $200 with tip and no alcohol...but we don't mind paying that if it is worth it. It was worth it. We will be back if we are ever on that side of town again!"}
{"text":"Here's what was bad: 
We waited forty minutes after our 7:30 reservation to be seated for dinner. Our party of 13 had to sit separately even after a 40 minute wait past our reservation time. 

Our medium rare steaks were overdone and chewy. 

My dad's lobster tail was not fresh. Our crab salad was not good either - it didn't have any flavor. 

Service was fine - not as professional and polished as you'd expect from a $54 steak restaurant but not horrible either. We sat by the kitchen though and could hear all the waitstaff side convos and etc. 

Here is what was good: 
Delicious mac n cheese, mom's lamb was delicious and cooked perfectly, sautéed mushrooms were awesome."}
{"text":"First time here. Normally visit Hanks at Green Valley Ranch when we venture out for steak. I had the ribeye and it was excellent. In fact, it was one of the best I've ever had. My wife had the filet and lobster tail. The filet was good. The lobster tail was dry and without flavor. The sides and appetizers were so-so. The reason I won't be back? The beer selection. Yes, they can name off all the beers they have but they are obviously upset to do so. Second, their beer selection sucks unless you want Budweiser, miller lite, etc, etc. I asked for a porter, which goes great with a steak. No porter. I asked for an IPA. Nope. I asked for an amber ale. Nope. Anyway, their bar manager needs to be fired. I'm surprised that a steak house with such good reviews wouldn't take the time to add a couple quality, craft beers to the menu."}
{"text":"Exceptional service but the food was terrible. Filet Mignon tasted as if it was marinated in chlorine pool water and the crab cakes tasted like feet. Don't take suggestions on cocktails, the vodka recommendation was awful. Staying at this hotel, everything has been awesome and our waiter Derrick,  was great but I'd never recommend this venue in the resort to anyone."}
{"text":"About 10 miles west on the Vegas Strip but worth the drive. Beef is the word here as they grow their own cattle for the restaurant. Any steak is large, shareable and delicious. Expensive but not by NYC or Vegas comparison. In the M hotel, classy not glitzy."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in town mixed with Monday night football is a must.  The service is awesome. The bar menu is half price.  Calm atmosphere.  We will return next week. Sorry, pic shows one piece missing.  It's the tuna.. yum."}
{"text":"i came here with some colleagues and had the chicken. it was pretty tasty but definitely pricey. would recommend if you are looking for a decent steak house"}
{"text":"We dined at Anthony's on Christmas Day evening, so perhaps our visit was not representative.  However, we didn't think our meal was deserving of the high marks that have been described here.

Positives:
+ We were greeting by a friendly host, and immediately escorted to a nice table in the rear of the restaurant.  Even though there were many waiting for tables, our reservation was honored, no problem.
+ Nice space, modern and tasteful.
+ Wine was 1/3 off!  Nice surprise for Christmas.
+ Soups (lobster bisque and chowder) were superb.  Sadly, this was the best part of the meal.

So-so:
- Sides were OK.  Had the green beans and much-lauded cream corn.  The corn was good, but not the \"best in the world\" experience that some have expressed here.
- Waiter was somewhat distant, seemed preoccupied.  Perhaps he didn't want to be working the holiday.  Only warmed up at the very end when presenting the check.

Negatives:
- Meal was rushed.  Our starters (soups) were delivered to the table literally 3 minutes after the waiter left the table, even before he could bring our bottle of wine.  I can only guess that he entered the order in their system, and the kitchen runner immediately brought it out.
- We both ordered steaks:  bone-in ribeye and bone-in filet.  Both were cooked perfectly, but strangely, the ribeye was room temperature.  I still cant figure that one out.  You'd think they had grilled up steaks in advance, and just had them sitting, waiting to be ordered by someone.
- Not a good value.  Strip prices, but falls short of a fine dining experience.

Given the prices here, not willing to give them a second chance.  Probably will not return."}
{"text":"We just had a perfect meal at Anthony's. It was our first time there and selected this spot based on the great reviews. The reviews were right on the money. Impeccable service, white linen table cloths, and excellent food. I started with the mozzarella and tomato salad, then moved on to the bone in, New York steak. Wow! That steak was perfect in every way. I just had to pick up the bone and savor every morsel of tasty meat!  If you are not a penny-pincher, and you are looking for a quality spot to have a great meal, then this is a sure choice in Henderson."}
{"text":"This place just stays amazing with it's service and food quality!  This seems to be our birthday dinner celebration hub, having celebrated my mom's 50th, my 30th, and now my dad's 58th here.  Our server, Derrick, was fantastic!  He was extremely courteous and efficient.  If you get the change to request a server, ask for him.  We praised his service to the manager, Frank, who we requested to stop by so we could let him know how great his employee was.

**Also, I'm a full-out WELL done steak person.  This is the ONLY restaurant I have ever been that can CONSISTENTLY serve a thick, 14oz New York Strip cooked perfectly well WITHOUT pink and WITHOUT butterflying it.  I love eating the steak here and have never had to return my steak to be cooked longer because they get it right the first time, every time!"}
{"text":"Just amazing.First the service by Bruno was spectacular. His knowledge of the menu and his manner at the table truly a pleasure. The food i must say was superb from the crab salad to the oysters the bass just brilliant.Frank you have put together a fantastic crew i cant thank you enough.Happy New Year to you all"}
{"text":"Delish.  Great service.  Wonderful view.  Relaxing and affordable as steak houses go.  Get off the tourist trap strip and get to the M for some wonderful food and a beautiful hotel/casino."}
{"text":"I would say this is an above average place to eat off the strip.  For the money, I would have expected a bit better service and a bit better cut of steak.   

The service wasn't bad, it was just good.  If this is trying to compete with Hanks or Todds, they need to step up a bit.  

The sides were pretty tasty although the signature tots did not live up to the hype.   

My steak was well cooked but for 48 bucks I would have expected a better ribeye steak.   In retrospect, I should have ordered the bone-in ribeye as that was a tastier steak for $15 bucks more.  

The environment and the decor of the venue is quite nice and this is one of my favorite casino resorts in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go in Las Vegas. The service is awesome, the food is awesome... I have never had a bad meal or appetizer and the price is to be expected for an up scale steak place.  It is best to make reservations but you can always eat at the bar and still have a great experience."}
{"text":"I came here with two friends for a late dinner and was very satisfied with the quality of both food and service.

SERVICE & ATMOSPHERE

From beginning to end, (hostess, waiter, busser) the employees were top notch. They were obviously experienced in fine dining and knew how to be friendly enough, but reserved and polite at the same time. 

The restaurant itself is HUGE. Since we came pretty late, there were not many tables filled, which would have made for a very relaxing dinner if it wasn't for the inappropriately-chosen pop music and table of rowdy drunk women nearby.

FOOD

Do get:
The rib-eye (super juicy and tender)
Jumbo asparagus
Strawberry-raspberry mini macarons (the accompanying yogurt gelato is refreshing)
Jumbo lump crab and roasted beet salad

I recommend you skip:
Clam chowder (my friends liked it but I found it to be quite thin; I prefer chunky)
Tater tots (basic and dry)
Oysters (we had a variety of seasonal types, none of which were very appetizing)"}
{"text":"Me and my husband usually stay on the M Resort for special occasions. On my birthday we decided we would spend a little extra and eat at Anthony's. I guess my expectations were too high, because i left disappointed. 

We had reservations and were seated promptly on arrival, which was great considering there were only a handful of people in the restaurant for a Friday evening. I was surprised at how long it took for a waiter to greet us and further more disappointed then how long we waited for our order to me taken. 

Dover Sole is my absolute favorite fish and is always a treat when we make it at home. I was very much looking forward to enjoying this dish at my visit. It was a decent size portion and garnished nicely, however was absolutely tasteless. I would say that the $42 was drastically overpriced for what i received. 

My husband got a steak that was flavored well and cooked to his liking, which made me regret my choice in menu selection even more. We shared the mashed potatoes and asparagus, which were both good and well portioned. 

After we completed our dinner they spared no time clearing our plates off the table, but then waited more than 10minutes for someone to bring us our check. i have no ambition to revisit this establishment in the future and will continue to buy my Dover Sole at the store (previously frozen) for a reasonable price and better taste."}
{"text":"If your a vegan just stop reading now ..... cause this place is not for you ~ although there are some beautiful side dishes you could eat.  I wanna tell the rest of you about the perfectly cooked dry aged beef , specifically the 22 oz medium rare bone in ribeye I shared with the hubby.  Get ready to groan out loud cause its perfection in every bite. Can't gush enough! We went simple with a shared chopped salad and a baked potato the size of a child's arm.... smothered with gobs of butter, sour cream, chives and wait for it ... bacon .  Now I must confess this isn't a low calorie meal BUT it was a marvelous treat.  The entire bill was around a $100 bucks with a piece of slap your mama chocolate cake. Yep so when you wanna put down the kale smoothie and rice cakes make yourself a reservation and GO. Darling service staff . Did I mention we were in shorts and flip flops and NOBODY bated an eye . Do It."}
{"text":"Our 2nd time at Anthony's and it was so good!  The bread basket came out and it had sourdough, raisin bread, baguette and bread crisp with poppy seeds.  Reminds me of poppadums.  Fresh bread, what can I say!

We ordered the following:
- 12oz Prime Rib rare - Like butter and sitting in a pool of au jus, comes with an heirloom tomato, a grilled artichoke and a bit of greens.
- 14oz Rib Eye - Tasty, tasty, tasty!  Grilled to perfection and rare as I had asked.  Very well seasoned with salt and pepper.  Also comes with an heirloom tomato, a grilled artichoke and a bit of greens.
- Sea bass - very well received and tastes out of this world!  Comes with bok choy. 
- Halibut - also delicious with a pineapple garnish.

Side dishes:
- Mashed potatoes - very creamy and smooth
- Sweet Potato - very well prepared
- Asparagus - I love the way they prepare the asparagus!

Excellent wait service at M Resort."}
{"text":"Went back again to try the American Kobe steak. This time I went during happy hour, and from 5-7 every day bar appetizers are all half off! Because I wanted to save my appetite, I only ordered the clam chowder soup, which was rich and delicious, with plenty of clams.  Then came the kobe steak, which though wasn't a true Kobe from Japan, which would have been impossible for a variety of reasons, much less the $72 price tag, but the steak was raised under similar conditions apparently.  The beef was heavenly and there was a definite difference in taste and silky texture.  It was really tender, similar to biting into a thick piece of fat, but with the taste and feel of beef.  Totally unreal.  

The only complaint I have is the accoutrements, which included supposed black truffle slices.  True black truffle has an instantaneous distinction, a strong earthy aroma and taste which enhances and pretty much overwhelms everything. These waxy plastic chips had nothing- no smell, no taste, nothing.  It tasted like stale beets, with no taste to them.  I had to ask the waitress what they were because I had to make sure, and she verified they were supposed to be black truffles.  I remember seeing a 60 Minutes report on the truffle market in France, about cheap truffles made in China that was flooding the market and bared little resemblance to truffles.  Well, apparently they've found their way to Las Vegas unfortunately.  But it's easy to tell, real truffles would have brought the price of the meal up $400-500, so it's easy to overlook.  I'd prefer that they not put it in myself, to just add a drop of truffle oil or two if necessary.

At any rate, excellent 5 star meal overall, with their \"Doughnuts and Coffee\" for dessert.  The coffee part was an espresso chocolate syrup to dunk the doughnuts in, which were actually more like doughnut holes.  Unfortunately the doughnut pieces were too big to fit in the syrup cup, so you had to squish them to fit and with the whipped cream it was difficult, so they have a little to work out on that part.  I probably wouldn't order this again, but it was still good."}
{"text":"This review is for their bar happy hour only

We love to gamble in the M, this place has amazing happy hour during weekdays, all half off appetizer plus 30% off wine bottle. 

Duck spring roll is amazing, oysters are taste very fresh, their fries is good too somehow. 

Their happy hour is a must go if you are in M"}
{"text":"I will definitely be back to this restaurant it was fabulous.  Excellent beef.   Experienced staff and a great wine list.  Also seafood phenomenal"}
{"text":"I don't know who their director of Food and Beverage is,however this Steakhouse is a nightmare.First the reservations were made for 4 people at 7p.m. on a Friday evening and when we arrived,I was shocked to see tbhey didn't even have table clothes on the tables,which is,in my humble opinion,ridiculous for a fine dining Steak house.We were told it would bde 30 to 45 minutes and decided to come back,telling the host we would return in 30 minutes.When we returned in 25,she said it would still be 30 minutes an we went to the bar,where there were only 2 seats.The ladies sat while we went and shot craps and didn't get seated until almost 9 p.m. an hour and 45 minutes past our reservation.I said the food must be great and I ordered a Pittsburgh rare strip steak and the others all ordered steaks at various temperatures.My steak was medium and not done Pittsburgh and I sent it back,while all three of the others were over cooked.The steaks took another 30 minutes,for Pittsburgh rare and came out rare but not even close to being charred on the outside.I asked the waiter if the chef knew what Pittsburgh meant and he said he didn't know.I asked him if he knew and he said it was extra rare!!!I don't know why he didn'y know something that simple,but if he didn't,why he didn't bother to ask.The place looked pathetic for a casino,like a rustler, for a fine dining establishment and the management ultimately are the only ones responsible for this kind of experience.Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Hate to do this guys but I am a regular customer who enjoys frequenting your establishment.

Service and food cycle on Saturday night was HORRENDOUS!  Plain and simple.  The server was notably absent from the table and when offering service was a total smart ass to my wife

Now we have to wait a bit to come back.  You get the right to have a BAD night.  Please do not make it a habit."}
{"text":"My GF made a simple request for dinner, \"I want a great prime rib dinner where we won't be served a low quality skirt steak painted up like a Prime Rib\" After doing some research I picked Anthony's thinking She can get her Prime Rib and I can get a good steak.

Well I was wrong, I didn't get a \"good\" steak I got an unbelievably awesome steak. Until last night I honestly believed my father and I made the worlds best two steaks Anthony's is now on my list as number one. it was lightly seasoned, perfectly marinated and ooh so incredibly melt in your mouth tender/juicy. I almost wish I had ordered a 2nd one to take home with us. 

The GF loved her Prime Rib and devoured almost every last bit of it, not something she normally does. We shared a salad and a side order of the mashed potatoes.  The summer herb vinaigrette for the salad was amazing! We were dipping almost everything we had on the table in it and may have just guzzled it down had they left a bottle of it on the table. 

The potatoes were a little bland but were a creamy smooth delight if you put them on your plate and used them to soak up some of the steak juice.  Another disappointing part of the evening was with our Raw Oyster appetizer. We ordered the half dozen and were served 6 Oysters that if combined may have actually made up two or three adult sized Oysters for the price we paid for them we should have been given oysters the size of my fist but they were the only disappointment of the night.

Sorry but thats not true, I was disappointed with the beer selection, no draft beers and nothing you couldn't find down at the local store. Also, You go to a steak house to eat a great steak and have a great dining experience with friends and family but they were teasing me with the MLB playoffs being on a TV in the next section and the TVs were too far away for me to catch the score over the GFs shoulder. 

Our server was great, perfect timing, knew the menu and could answer questions about what was in the dishes and would pair well with the other items on the menu. I wish I had thought to ask him to give me the playoff score updates as I was sitting there.  Well maybe next time and trust me there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"We decided to stay local on our most recent Vegas trip. A couple of Yelp searches led me to Anthony's.

We arrived at our reserved time and was given the option to sit at the tables or booth. The host was very nice and welcoming. 

The restaurant is beautiful and modern. We sat in the booths with full view of the kitchen and the hanging marble table. 

We had ordered our drinks with the assistant waiter. He gave us a weird look when we refused the wine list and kept insisting that we should take a look at it. Pushy much?

The bread and butter with olive oil was good, I had to stop in order to save my appetite. I ordered my steak medium rare, and it was more on the rare side. I never send back food so I had to deal with it. The lobster ravioli was good and had chunks of lobster throughout. The vanilla creme brulee was delicious, and had fresh berries on top, its one of the best I've ever had.

Our waiter could have been more attentive during the meal, he was in the back much more than the floor. We had to wait to have our glasses refilled a few times, and even left with empty cups. However, when it came time to pay the bill, he was standing by the kitchen, watching us like a hawk. Yes, all of us are going to run out full speed in our 4 inch heels and skirts, mm-hmm. 

This place is ok, we had to try it at least once. I would not come back nor would I recommend it to anyone. I need better service and my meat cooked correctly. Next time I will suck it up and just journey to my favorite steakhouse on the strip."}
{"text":"Dinner last night. This is an amazing restaurant. Ambiance was really nice. We had reservations for three. They took us in immediately.
 I order the halibut. It was like silk melting in my mouth! Yes. We also order tater tots they were okay.
The taretar was amazing! 
My bf had steak that was made by the steak gods! So yes the food was amazing !!
Our waiter was off his game last night. I asked for merlot he asked me white or red wine??? My bother and his brother both agreed they heard me say Merlot. Our dinner came without our sides. He then asked us where our sides were at? Last when paying he came back and told my boyfriend his Amex exceeded spending limit. Well that's impossible because there is NO limit on his Amex. Machines don't read that as description! Disgusting and RUDE! 
We will consider returning.."}
{"text":"Steakhouse on one side and Italian on the other.

- Dim lights.
- romantic setting.
- not cheap eating.
- very elegant inside.
- should dress nice, we didn't.
- very friendly waiter.

Come up: Prime rib - med well (38.ish)

Prime rib came out in like 5 minutes of ordering...sort of odd.  The meat was warm - not sure why.  I thought the meat was a bit on the dry side...ugh.  Definitely not the best Prime Rib I've ever eaten - I expected much better...sorry.  I'll stick with the Rib eye next time I guess.

Would come back."}
{"text":"Made dinner reservations for me and the Misses for our Christmas Eve. When I called to make the reservation, the lady asked me for booth or table and I said booth. Upon arrival, on time, the hostess says our table is not ready and will be a few minutes. 20 minutes later, we get seated...at a table! Misses says to let it go so I did. Got seated and took 15 minutes just to get menus. Took our drink order, after another 15 minutes. Finally order. Misses got some type of surf and turf. I got theee most expensive steak on the menu since alot of reviews rave about it. And since I am a big fan of a good steak. We shared calamari. 37 mins later we get our calamari (barely warm). Was really good. 20 mins later entre's come out...was barely warm. Food was super good. My steak was incredibly tender. Wish it were more hotter tho. Can tell it sat for a while. Will come back one more time to see if the dining experience is different. Maybe it was just an off night"}
