{"text":"We were looking for a quick and affordable brunch spot, a change of pace from Eggspectation.  Gauffre Mignonne was close to our hotel, so we TRIED to make it happen.  Walked through the door, and literally stood, waiting to be seated for several minutes, having the 2 floor staff workers walk DIRECTLY in front and past us several times without even the simplest of greetings.  While standing, we attempted to read the menu which didn't afford an English translation.  After about 6 minutes, one of the workers finally offered an uninspired 'Hello'.  We asked for a table for two.  He told us to wait, he quickly wiped and cleared off a table, and then promptly went back to ignoring us.  He did not offer us to be seated, not a menu, nothing.  We seated ourselves, and waited...again.  After another several minutes, still nothing.  We then agreed to gather our things and leave without a second thought.

For a place this small, they cannot afford to have horrible customer service.  Only restaurant/cafe in Montreal we have experienced this."}
{"text":"Comme le nom de ce commerce l'indique, modulo la faute d'orthographe, il s'agit d'un endroit où on mange des gaufres. Les crêpes sont donc correctes mais pas l'élément central de la carte.

Les gaufres sont très bonnes, et diverses recettes permettent de satisfaire tout le monde. Le service est de bonne qualité et la situation assez bonne."}
{"text":"The food and service were both excellent! I had a lovely latte and the Thai chicken sandwich.  My sis had the veggie waffles (which were also delicious). I brought my one year old son and the owner went out of his way to accommodate us.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Would not go back again. Ordered the crepe with turkey, cheese, and tomato and everything looked and tasted cheap. The turkey was clearly slices of turkey breast and the crepe was soggy and rubbery. Worst of all the staff forgot the tomato and still charged me for it. The only redeeming quality on the plate was the salad of fresh fruit. There's amazing things to eat in Montreal and lots in the area so I would certainly choose something better."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with my sister to get some lunch. We were lucky to see this place and eat here!
Great food, and a great price. I paid around $8 for a crepe with nutella and fruit (strawberries+blueberries) and my sister paid close to the same for a very tasty waffle with fruit and real maple syrup. I found the crepe to be a little soft, but my sister loved it - I think the waffle was awesome :)
The inside is very cute, and the selection on the menu is fantastic. I ordered a iced cappuccino as well but was disappointed - I was expecting a slushie like texture but it was basically iced coffee with whipped cream. Still very good, I just made an unfortunate assumption. They could also use a bathroom update - the tap sprays a bit, and the soap+paper towels were empty.
The only real issue I had with this place is that the service was slow - we waited about 15 minutes to order after we had stopped looking at the menu, and there are only about 6 tables in the place (and only when I went up to the counter to ask about ordering).
Additionally, I had almost finished my crepe when I finally got my cappuccino. The waters even took a long time to come. However, the food itself only took about 15-20 mins once ordered and it was delicious so we ate quickly! 

All in all, a great place, absolutely worth the price, and in a great location. The staff are friendly, although a little disorganized. I will definitely be back and will modify my review if the service is better."}
{"text":"They were seriously understaffed the day I went. We stood there by the cash register for about 6-7 minutes before I could even order. Then a swarm of people lined up behind us because everyone realized that no waiter was available to come a wait on them. I'm still unsure if there normally a waitstaff to serve you. If there normally is, they were seriously lacking in staff. If there are no waiters normally, then maybe there should a sign that says \"order here\" above the register so people are not just waiting at their tables.

Tables went unbussed and the food was slow to arrive. My waffle was cold and soggy and you could tell it had been sitting a while because the whipped cream lost its shape and was just a lump of half melted cream. Even if it came out warm, the quality of the waffles is just average...like a waffle at IHOP or Denny's.

Maybe it was just a bad day, but this place definitely doesn't deserve 4 stars. It looks like it would be clean, charming, conveniently located (staff was friendly too)...but my dining experience was not so good."}
{"text":"Great place to grab delicious brunch. We went in at 12 on a Sunday, no wait. The food was delicious  and good price. Recommend the open bacon sandwich. Great portions and right downtown!"}
{"text":"I had the hash breakfast and i really liked it. They serve 2 sunny side up in a skillet with potatoes, pepper and cheese. I substituted the ham and bacon for turkey. The presentation is impressive."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I came for brunch.  We ordered a strawberry and nutella crepe, and a  meatlover's. The crepe was average but the meatlover's was pretty good.  Great service and a really cute place!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from them via Foodora (it's me and my loved one only day off together and were a bit lazy) and the food came super fast, portions were really good and quality/price is A+.
I ordered some american breakfast while my girlfriend ordered some waffle... We were expecting the food to be a little bit cold but it wasn't at all !!! The presentation was okay but I guess that's just because of transportation and doesn't really affect the taste of my food doesn't it!
I recommend, next time I'll go in restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"I can't say anything about the food as on Yelp is says on Sundays it was open until 6pm and on Google Maps says it was until 9pm. I can, tho, say about the service and lack of attention to up to date info + service.

I walked my mother-in-law, who has a lot of trouble walking, and arrived before 5pm. As we walked in, someone came to us saying it was closed, and when prompted about the opening hours I had seen, I was answered simply with \"Supposedly\".

Nice."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and we will be back before the end of our trip! Everything was delicious from the perfectly fluffy homemade waffles to the not-too-sweet iced coffee. If you're in the area and want brunch or coffee quick, stop in! (Bonus: the music is awesome!)"}
{"text":"Great waffles, friendly service and not always busy with late hours
A nice place for a late bite when you have a craving or just to go from a breakfast or brunch"}
{"text":"Nous cherchions un endroit pour déjeuner près du quartier des spectacles et nous avons pensé que cet endroit serait une bonne idée. Erreur. Nous étions 3 et avons pris 3 types de café différents qui étaient tous médiocres et nous avions également tous trois une rage de crêpe salée. Nous avons commandé la crêpe jambon-oeuf-fromage et nous cherchions notre fromage. Une parmi nous avait demandé des patates en à-côté (pour 3$ de plus!) et elle s'est méritée un minuscule bol de frites congelées ultra-salées. Nos crêpes n'étaient pas bonnes et nous avons cru déceler un goût très prenant de Miracle Whip à l'intérieur de la crêpe. Comme si on nous avait refilé du jambon déjà mayonnaisé pour les sandwiches. Un menu bourré de fautes et un personnel un peu trop stressé. Franchement, à éviter."}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriend, nice place with friendly staff. We shared a s'mores waffles and it was truly amazing ! Really nice plate and it comes with a few bananas and strawberries to dip in chocolate on the side. I'd recommend to go there on an empty stomach tho, because that was some heavy s'mores waffle !"}
{"text":"N'y allez pas pour un brunch salé. Les pommes de terre ont un goût de surgelés et le café n'est pas compris dans le prix élevé pour ce qui est proposé. Très déçus par cette expérience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast/brunch place so far! I discovered this at first on Foodora, on a day I was very sick and wasn't expecting a food delivery to be good but I fell in love! Decided to go back with my boyfriend and we both agreed on coming back! 
First time we came in restaurant tho, I think morning shift's people were about to leave because we weren't really greeted... Then we waited a good 10-15 min before someone came to see us! 
Afterward the food came fast and the guy who replaced our server was reaaaally sweet! 
Anyway, the breakfast potatoes are to die for, the sausages are juicy and there is a good fruit portion. Fruits juice are really good and their coffee too!!!
Must try!"}
{"text":"Food and service amazing. Paid 1/3 of what I would have in Mahattan for food 3x as good. Empty mid-week at mid-day. Worth the trip. Waffes and crepes satisfied carnivore and vegetarian in the group."}
{"text":"We had two dinner crepes here tonight; ham, egg & cheese AND turkey, tomato & cheese, with Maple syrup drizzled over them. They were delicious!! The guys were so polite and quick with their service. Now off to see our show at Theatre St. Denis! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Went here due to other good reviews, and we were the only customers in the place for the majority of our time there. Usually you would expect good service from this, but we were sadly disappointed. 
Service was poor from start to finish, food was served up to 5 minutes apart, our drinks weren't served until we reminded the server that we ordered them (this was when our food arrived), and the two staff spent the majority of the time watching videos on their phone. 
Sadly, the food also didn't redeem this experience, my savoury waffle was nothing to write home about and one of my friends orders was delivered wrong. So this was a rather disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Good coffee, good food, good service. Place was extremely busy and there were only 2 employees working. Yet they were still attentive and quick. Get the iced mocha coffee. Waffles and crepes were both very good. 

No complaints."}
{"text":"Amazing menu, staff really earned their tip, overall delicious and cool place! Pretty easy location to get to as well. I had the smores waffles which were to die for. Saw other people ordering sandwiches and breakfast items which came out in big portions. Best hot chocolate I've had!"}
{"text":"2 guys just killin it!!! Amazing crepes, good coffee selection, my boyfriend loved the meat lovers hash skillet. We were stuffed! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Great coffee and nice service. Would highly recommend this place! I got the waffles with maple syrup and bananas and blueberries - hands down the best waffles I've ever had!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here with a lust of waffle. He had the regular one. I had the specialty s'more waffle. I like mine. It came with banana and strawberry. the marshmallow is just perfect. I had a bite of my husband's waffle. I think it was not crispy enough on the outside. Overall his waffle was only average. I like my s'more.
Coffee was just OK, below average.
The ambiance is great. I like the decoration."}
{"text":"Perfect family brunch. Savoury and sweet waffles...AND S'MORES ARE ON THE MENU!! I resisted though. They also have yummy looking crepes and some classic sandwiches. Just all around a solid breakfast brunch with a little bit of a twist. Not very busy around 12-1 on a Sunday and good service."}
{"text":"Excellent find through yelp and it exceeded our expectations. The food was very tasty and the portions are great. I had the Very Berry waffle and it has been the best meal I've had so far in my trip through Canada. The waiter was very polite and accommodating to my disabled mom. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness. This could easily be the best breakfast I've ever had in my life. 

I ordered the Sugar Rush waffle which comes with caramelized bananas, chocolate swirl syrup, whipped cream, and a mini hot chocolate. I also had a side of eggs sunny side up, breakfast potatos, and bacon. 

My husband was horrified at the ferocity and speed at which I finished my meal. I thought I was going to eat him too if he tried to touch my food. It was just SO good. And the price was quite reasonable as well.

Just go. I don't know what else to say. I want to eat here forever."}
{"text":"This place was five minutes walk from the hotel and personally, this was probably the fastest service I've experienced coming to Montreal. I ordered crepes and the portion and the price ratio is perfect. I find it odd to have greens for breakfast, but I can't complain when the greens are seasoned very well."}
{"text":"1 person hosting, serving, taking orders and making all the drinks. While one chef makes everything else. Does that seem right?
The menu is not very diverse and confusing.
It's suppose to be a brunch place yet they don't carry just a simple bacon and egg combo.
Everything is complicated and confusing!
Was not flavourful or filling.
Small portions.
I bet if there was more staff they would be doing much better.
Apparently on trip advisor it's rated a top restaurant to eat at..
Don't trust it.
Wouldn't ever come back here.
Slow service!!!"}
{"text":"Average food with disappointing service. There were no other people in the store, yet our food took ages - the staff clearly just didn't care. 

First of all, our drinks didn't arrive until after our food. We had to remind him to bring them. It was just iced coffee and tea (literally just hot water, come on). Instead of making drinks, the two workers were watching videos on their phones. The food came out very staggered, and I literally had to watch my food sit on the counter for ages and get cold before coming out. They were literally just being super lazy - there was no reason. Half the food came out 10 minutes before the rest.

The food itself was fine, but nothing to write home about. My order came out incorrectly, but I wasn't going to ask them to fix it knowing how long it took them to make a simple waffle to begin with. I do not have the patience for that. My bacon was a bit burnt, but fine. It wasn't a satisfying meal by any means. Everyone I was with seemed ok with their food, but it definitely wasn't great. The only genuinely good thing was the potatoes. 

I was honestly so surprised - the reviews on here are so good, but our experience was so completely disappointing."}
{"text":"C'était bon, c'était ok, mais tout, tout, tout était froid, la fille est pressée de prendre notre commande, et le service est long.. il n'y avait aucun Rush lorsqu'on est arrivé... nous étions 2 à commander des crêpes, et 2 a commander des Gaufres... Les crêpes sont restées sur le comptoir de service , sans réchaud, avec l'air clim dans le tapis pendant plusieurs minutes, donc c'était très froid... On reçoit nos cafés alors qu'on a terminé de manger (il y avait maintenant un lineup) , et ils sont froids, une amie m'a même pas eu son café, ni des patates ... On me charge les patates de mon amie... Personne n'est venu nous voir pour savoir si c'était ok... Lorsqu'on le dit à la fille, elle nous dit que ce n'est pas de sa faute, qu'ils ont eu un Rush, avec un air vraiment pas sympathique... Ils étaient 4 au total, service, cuisine et plonge... La vaisselle est lavée à la main, et comme ils sont occupés, la vaisselle sale traîne sur les tables, ou sur le comptoir de service ... Ca m'a coûté 21$ pour une crêpe très mince et froide, beaucoup de crème fouettée, l'équivalent de 2 bananes et du caramel, avec un grand latte froid (qui devait être chaud..)
Aucune de nous 4 à été satisfaites, et nous avons toutes encore faim! ..."}
{"text":"Had a vegetarian waffle, which was good but so terribly small portion. We were still hungry afterwards and this place is super expensive. If you're going to do breakfast, big portions are important and refills on coffee -__- don't go her, not worth it."}
{"text":"Coffee and tea place for more relax meeting with friends in the area. Sugar sugar sugar ... and many tables."}
{"text":"yummy waffles
light and airy on the inside and crunchy on the outside
good service
good coffee"}
