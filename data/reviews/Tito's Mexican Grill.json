{"text":"Great local restaurant!! The food is the best Mexican around and the wait staff treat you like family! I would give 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and service, can be slow to get your food when it's busy (evenings/weekends), but overall a good value."}
{"text":"Came here for Cinco de Mayo a few days ago. Waited nearly two hours to be seated. The manager sat other people ahead of us even though we were there first and had young kids with us.  He also cussed out another patron who complained about the long wait. The next day, my friend and I were SICK. 
AVOID THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"My favorite \"Mexican\" food in town. There are a few items on the menu that I haven't seen anywhere else. The Gold margaritas are also fantastic"}
{"text":"Good food. Great service. This is a good place with reasonable prices and a wide selection to choose from. I had the enchiladas chipotle with chicken. Tasty and just enough food for lunch. Margaritas are raved about here. There are top shelf and well versions with associated prices. They're okay. The atmosphere is nice. I would come back. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Food was very good! I got the spinach and cheese enchiladas. The spinach filling was DELICIOUS, however there was a bit too much cheese sauce on top for me. Service was a little slow, but they were busy, so that's understandable. Prices were very reasonable and I was overall pleased!"}
{"text":"I've had great food every time.  I typically order the chicken salad or the Mexico special, and my husband always gets a steak dish - delicious and consistent. I really like their queso. 

The prices are fair and there's rarely too long of a wait.  

My only concern is the service.  It's very hit and miss, and we go there once pretty often (about 1x a week), so we've had everything from the best to the worst in servers."}
{"text":"Much better than el rancho and mariachi locos"}
{"text":"The food is good but beware ordering takeout for a large group. We ordered about 9 meals at lunch time and when we got back to the office we discovered we had been shorted one, mine. We called Tito's and were told they knew we were shorted because \"it is sitting right here\". The woman we spoke with offered to replace the missing meal and for our inconvenience add another meal. When I stopped there after work to pick up the meals, I was told that they would only replace the missing meal. We will think twice before ordering from Tito's again."}
{"text":"Chipotle enchiladas are my regular choice.  They come out delicious with a cheese quesadilla and small salad with guac.  This place is ten times better than the other local Mexican joints in the area."}
{"text":"The quality of food is better than most Mexican restaurants in area. However it's always packed and the staff has a hard time handling it. The margaritas are perfect. Not too much sour mix. The atmosphere is nice though. Once you get the server's attention, they are nice but not quick. I would've rated this place lower, but the food and drinks are too good."}
{"text":"While I'm not a big fan of Mexian food, I would go back to Tito's.  Our viist started out as a frown!   Guests, including what appeared to be wait staff, were smoking just outside the front door. WHAT???  Not a good first impression.  
We were immediately greeted once we got inside and shown to our table with no problem.   Service was quick and friendly and my chicken, taco salad was fresh and tasty. My wife was equally pleased with her fish taco dinner   We enjoyed the visit.  Nice job Tito's!!"}
{"text":"This is \"Mexican\" food ... Ohio style.  That being said, it's the best in town.

The carne asada tacos are very, very good.  A little lime, a little cilantro and it's as close to street food as you can get in a 50 mile radius (that's a huge compliment).

Don't waste your time ordering a margarita - order a Paloma (tequila & Sprite), it's what they drink in Mexico (for real) and it's much better than any mix.  Order with Don Julio, trust me.

The queso dip with chorizo is a fabulous starter.  

The grilled chicken (fajita chicken) is very good.

Service is getting better.  There was a rough start, but after 4 or 5 visits, it's improved greatly.

If you want to order the \"Ohio Mexican\" food, then I'm sure it's just like any place else.  Order the real stuff and it's quite a nice experience."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. Waited just a few minutes before getting seated. Had tacos and Nachos. Food great and service fast and friendly. Great bar also. Ail definately go back."}
{"text":"The BEST mexican restaurant in the fairlawn/akron area. The staff is so amazing, especially the owner. Always greeting each table as if family, and the servers are amazing as well. Great food and an amazing atmosphere! Always going to eat here when i'm in for a tasty mexican dish!"}
{"text":"I've been to Tito's a few times now and have sat at the bar on every occasion, so I can't attest to the service while sitting at a table. For your typical Mexican restaurant, the inside is clean and looks fairly new. The service is average (when it gets busy it's a little slower) and the food definitely comes out quickly after ordered. In my opinion, the food is your typical run of the mill Mexican food you will get at Mariachis or Tres Portillos, but it is pretty cheap. I usually get chicken fajitas which are about $9 and it's enough food for 2 meals. If you're looking for a clean, Mexican restaurant with quick service and you're average Mexican cuisine this place is for you!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. However the service on this night was not great. 4 different servers were asked to bring water. Meal was almost complete when the water showed up. Waited 30 minutes for the check. Yikes. Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"So-so tacos for lunch. Good guacamole & fresh chips."}
{"text":"My family has been eating here off and on for a couple of years. Every visit is different. Many times we have terrible service--long wait to get order taken and do not get drinks refilled until the meal is almost finished. I do not recommend eating here if you are in a hurry! However, the food is pretty good. Again, not the most consistent, but it is never terrible. Prices are above average for Mexican cuisine and the food isn't any better than the less expensive competition. We eat here because it is close to home, but when time permits, we drive across town to a faster, less expensive favorite. If you just want to sit and enjoy some chips, fresh salsa, cheese dip, fresh guacamole, margaritas, and good company with no time restraints, this is a great place."}
{"text":"I was in Akron on a business trip and I did not want to venture too far from the hotel to get something to eat for dinner; I accessed Yelp and located Tito's Mexican Grill.

Much like Soly Z I also lived in Southern California, and I moved back to NW Ohio in 2013. Trying to find anything even remotely comparable to the plethora of excellent Mexican restaurants found in SoCal has been a major challenge at best.

When I arrived, the parking lot seemed to have a lot of vehicles so I was encouraged. Walking inside, the restaurant was somewhat busy for a Sunday evening. It seemed as if they were short staffed as the servers were hurrying around in attempts to get the job done.

When the server finally arrived at my table he apologized for the wait and I appreciated his gesture. I had plenty of time to look at the menu so I was ready to order.

The chips and salsa arrived and the salsa was very bland. Thankfully there was some hot sauce available so I poured it in the salsa to hopefully add something to it. Close, but no cigar...

When my dinner came out, it was on 2 plates. Initially I thought there was no way I was going to be able to get through it all. The majority of items had ground beef as the featured item as well as a chili relleno. The food was just as bland as the salsa. Needless to say, my quest for authentic Mexican food here in Ohio continues. Ugh!"}
{"text":"Went to Tito's Mexican Grill last night. Ordered the Yucatan veggie fajita. OMG it was huge (enough left over for lunch today) and delicious. Our server Betty was wonderful. She was attentive and polite. Beware: Chips and salsa are addictive! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I walked in and was almost tempted to leave as no one was near the door and the place was empty. 

So glad I just walked up and sat at the bar. Chips and salsa was very good but hey that is hard to mess up. 

Ordered a Modelo from the tap. 

Looked through the menu and the person behind the bar recommended something different and I took his advice. Steak, shrimp and chorizo with onions, peppers, and cheese. They call in the Rio grande I believe. I call in amazing. 

It came with rice and beans and the guacamole salad. 

It was a little spicy. Maybe a 3 or 4 for people unlike me. 

One of the best meals I have had in a long time. Sure you had to wait a bit, but good food is worth the wait. 

I ordered Flan for dessert. Very tasty. I am a huge custard fan and this doesn't disappoint at all. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"Local storefront Mexican restaurant (in the former Egg Castle). Gold margaritas are good.  Food just ok.  Very clean.  Seems to be the new local hot spot."}
{"text":"Two friends and I came here after work on a recommendation from another friend.  The waitress was rude, I asked about happy hour specials and she gave me a blank stare.  The salsa was good, but other than that my burrito was bland.  I ordered a banana margarita that tasted like lime.  Save your time and money and go to other Mexican restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Love Mexican food but this place missed the mark.  New to the area so it's busy, but the food is not good.  I was hoping this place would be good because of its location, but not so much.  Better Mexican is not so far away..."}
{"text":"To-go orders are consistently late. Give yourself at least a half hour of extra time.   The food is authentic."}
{"text":"Tito's  definitely beats the average mexican. Top shelf margaritas were awesome. Chips and salsa very tasty. Had beef and chicken enchiladas with beans and rice. Very good. Retried beans were not just mush.  Staff was very attentive. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Beware of the Killer Sangria! Very strong and delicious. 
I ordered the shrimp quesidilla combo dinner with rice and beans.  The food came out quick and hot.  I was surprised how accommodating the server was with my Gluten allergy.  She said they could make anything with corn tortillas that I saw on the menu.  This was a first for me in a family style Mexican restaurant to acknowledge Gluten Free options.  The salsa and chips were fresh and tasty, not too spicy like some places.  This place is on our list of favorite places now."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  Great food, atmosphere and service! The total package. Our favorite place to eat out. You have to try Tito's."}
{"text":"Food is good, I usually get the chicken chimichangas. Decent rice and beans. My husband mixes it up more often than I do and is always happy with his meal.
LOVE the mojitos- I think it's difficult to find a well done, standard mojito when eating out. 
We go to Tito's when we want a quick Mexican meal and we choose this restaurant over the other Mexican places near by. 
They are usually pretty busy for dinner on the weekends, so prepare for a bit of a wait for one of their tables. The dining area isn't very big."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here, it was delicious and the service was excellent. Tonight I went with my fiancé and it was Christmas Eve.  Once again, the food was excellent, but the service was horrible. Our server asked us six times if we needed containers for our food. The first time he asked we had only had a couple bites of our dinner. Apparently we were holding him up from his Christmas Eve plans. I've never been so offended by a server in my life.  As we were standing up and leaving, I apologized for taking so long and keeping him from his plans. He said oh, no problem. Unbelievable! The guy should be fired on the spot!"}
{"text":"Salsa and chips. (Check!!!) The ambiance is really nice because it brings you to a place unlike any from the outside. The staff were nice and the food was great. We ordered fajita and enchiladas. The fajitas had a very good flavor. The salsa for the chips had a very good flavor with fresh ingredients used. I would have given it 5 but because we  asked for our dish to be extremely hot ( the waiter told us that we can tell him how hot we want our dish) and our orders did not have a single spicy kick in it, im giving it a 4. But the food was very giod for the price and it tasty. Just add some of the hot sauce on the table and you should be fine if uou are looking for something spicy."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in the Akron area. The food was excellent, with good spices. The service was efficient and polite. The restaurant was clean and the decor was comfortable. Highly recommend and will come back again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I both loved the fajitas and Mexican quesadilla. Our bartender worked his ass off all night running, yet we didn't feel neglected. He was on it. Loved the food and the service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Passing through town saw reviews and wanted to give it a try. Wasn't too impressed by the lack of personality of the hostess and our waiter wasn't much better. The pink lemonade tasted like water-the salsa was good but the food took way too long too come out for a half full restaurant. Food was OK but service was lacking. Would not come back"}
{"text":"Overall good authentic Mexican food

The fajitas are done just right

Highly recommend the traditional Mojito

Service can be slow sometimes but the staff is always friendly and accommodating from the moment you walk into the door"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped for lunch and probably should have kept driving. The service was slow and the food was really bland. It's almost like they opened a can of Old El Paso and used that to cook with."}
{"text":"Its average Mexican food, not that fresh nor the best !! Will never visit again"}
{"text":"Francisco is the best bartender in town. I dream at night about his caipirinhas. The food isn't very flavorful but isn't as homogenous in texture as it is at most Midwestern Mexican restaurants. The scene is chaotic, but polite."}
{"text":"I ate here based on the good reviews on Yelp and I'm not sure if my fellow Yelpers have never eaten good Mexican food or had a good waiter or if I went on two very off nights, but man was this place BAD.

Our waiter got 2 of 4 meals completely wrong the first time I went. By the time he had corrected it, the other half of our party had finished eating and was ready to go. No drink refills for the whole meal and the food was not good at all. He didn't refill our chips and salsa either.

I gave it a second try and that experience was just as bad. Food was rubbery and didn't taste fresh. The waitress had an attitude and forgot to bring out the queso until after we got our meals and had eaten half of them. We told her we wanted it before the meal and had no real use for it now and she rolled her eyes, but still left it on the bill. Had to speak with a manager to get it removed. 

I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"The Memory Waiter.  You know the guy:  He never writes anything down, because, well.  He's a pro.  He'll get everything right, right?  They never get anything wrong.  Just ask them.

So here's a new twist.  Sunday, that awkward time between too late for breakfast, don't want the full-blown brunch, just a tad too early for day drinking, hey howzabout some Meskin?  Off to Tito's.  First guy comes over, with his hands in his pockets.  A tad informal, even for a strip-mall Mexican restaurant.  My daughter really needed something, pronto, so we ordered her the appetizer bean nachos and were assured by Senor Pantspocket that it would be no more than five minutes.  \"Or six minutes,\" he added, which really sounded promising.  Five minutes later, he comes back.  \"Was that chicken, or beef?\"  I wanted to walk; cooler heads prevailed.  I marveled, as this guy wandered the restaurant, never once taking his hands out of his jeans. In hindsight I wondered if perhaps he didn't actually work there, but had no place else to be and decided to try his hand at food service.  Sort of working, while not quite working.

Finally, our REAL waiter arrived, and all was again right with the world, the food planets re-aligned, and Tito's won our hearts.  The food comes to table mere minutes after ordering.  (Two of our party had been here for a weekday business lunch, during which time was of the essence.  They get you in, get you out.)

Food was pretty good, portions allow for a full meal now, and a full meal whenever you remember you have that styrofoam box in the fridge. The decor is comically kitschy, although unintentionally so.  The Tito's name is emblazoned everywhere: table tops, chair backs, booths.  I mean EVERYwhere.  I checked my back in the mirror, thinking they may have slapped a Tito's sticker there, too.

(I would be remiss not mentioning that I still mourn the restaurant that once lived here:  The Egg Castle.  It was a castle, honoring the egg.  It was, for many years in my salad days the after-bar place, the post-10k race place, the hangover place, the walk of shame place.  It's the laughter we remember, when we remember the eggs that were...)

{"text":"My mother LOVES this place. 

Personally, I think she's gotten a little out of touch with our Texan roots and has forgotten what really good Mexican food tastes like. But, to each their own.

Their fajitas are solid, the seafood is as fresh as you're going to get in Ohio, and the margaritas are more quantity than quality, but sometimes that's all you're really looking for. But unfortunately, there's something missing that I can't put my finger on. There's like this inivisble line between meh Mexican restaurants and OH-LAWDY Mexican restaurants, I'm not sure what that is, but this place is on the meh side.

Service is usually pretty decent, so I can't complain there."}
{"text":"I ordered the Rio Bravo. Excellent. Way better than my last review. I don't know if the whole menu is any better but the rio bravo was really good."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice now, and we will most definitely not be going back. Akron has always had a very poor selection of Mexican restaurants, so naturally we were excited that there might be a better option opening so close. 

Our first visit was fair enough. The service was attentive, the chips and salsa were decent and fresh. I ordered a chicken dish with vegetables and tortillas that was a little bland, but with a little hot sauce turned out pretty well. My wife had a combo dish that featured a few different items all slathered in the same sauce. It seemed good at first but the sauce kind of made everything taste the same after awhile. The wait was a little long and the server gave us one of those punch cards with half the meals punched out. 

Our second visit was a disaster. Quite possibly the worst Mexican food experience either of us have ever had. My margarita had a poor consistency between the frozen and melted parts, the service was abysmal. Our server barely acknowledged us after taking our orders. My margarita came nearly instantly but my wife waited about 15 minutes for a glass of water and the waitstaff ignored our attempts to flag them down. This all might have been forgivable with some really awesome food, but it only got worse from there. 

I ordered an enchilada combo with one cheese, one beef and one chicken. Instead I got three cheese enchiladas and it was covered in the same overly sweet sauce that my wife had the first time. She ordered the fish tacos which came out in a pool of grease and with a pretty intense fish smell. Nearly inedible. The server gave us our check so quickly we hadnt even experienced the food to complain about it to him and he disappeared after that. 

The manager was nice enough not to charge us for anything but the margarita after we took our concerns to the front desk, but that was too little too late."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been waiting for this place to open for what seemed an eternity.  Then one evening as we drove by we noticed it open, but very few cars in the lot.  So, somewhat reluctantly we decided to give it a go, and boy are we glad we did!  As it turned out it was only the second day open for business, which could explain the excellent service.  I hope it continues once they get busy.  Towards the end of our meal the manager came by and explained that they were going through kind of a soft opening to give the staff time to break-in.  That was several weeks ago, now when you go past the parking lot is always full.

Do not let the strip center, store front exterior dissuade from going in, they did an great job on the interior.  I wish I could remember exactly what we had ordered, but our tastes are pretty open and we went with our server's suggestions.  Antonio did not disappoint in the least.  The food was very, very good, and actually equally as good the next day in that the portions are very generous.  Even after three or four adult beverages and a well deserved gratuity of about 25%, our bill was only around $35.

I would highly recommend Tito's when looking to satisfy your taste for Mexican. (not a Mexican, but for Mexican, as in food!)

BTW... Although the address says Ghent Road, it's actually in the old Egg Castle location which is more easily accessed off the side street (the name of which escapes me).  The small strip center it is in is next to the Winking Lizard.

Go and enjoy..."}
{"text":"Food is average, but every time I order something to go they get my food wrong or don't give me half of the order. Tired of driving back and forth when ordering from them. And I don't want to sit there and open every item I got and dig through it to make sure the meat is the one I ordered. They could do better...."}
{"text":"Ohio is my home state, but I live in LA and love good Mexican food. There was nothing special about the food at this place. However, the service was fantastic, the waiters were attentive, the food was inexpensive, and the margaritas are as cheap as they come. I wish the food was more authentic, but we're in Akron, so let's not be too picky. I don't know if I'll be back or not, but if I do it will be for the service, the salsa, and the drinks."}
{"text":"Went there last evening, not impressed with salsa but after my fajitas arrived, I was more than happy!  I travel to Mexico quite frequently, love Mexican food, and  I feel this is the best Mexican restaurant experience I have had other than in Mexico itself! 
    The portions were generous, but more importantly, the quality of the food was  superb!  Service was very good but did have to wait for the check.  I  have already recommended this restaurant to many people and will continue to do so.  
   After reading other reviews, I felt obligated to put my two cents in--I'll be back and soon!"}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing differential from any other Mexican restaurant. The service was less than acceptable. We sat for 10-15 minutes before anyone came over for a drink order."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how Titos doesn't have at least a 4. Service is great, food is great, and the margaritas are strong. Beware of the picky reviews. This is a well run establishment with best Mexican food in the area!"}
{"text":"Much better than I expected. Had read a few reviews, and figured it would be just an average restaurant. Pleasantly surprised at the super attentive service, very prompt, and very good food. 2 kids and 2 adults. We all loved our dinners. Visited on a Tuesday evening, and had no wait; seated right away at 6:15p. Also, decent margaritas. Definitely will be back for tex-mex. Fernando was an excellent server."}
{"text":"I love this place. My friend and I split the gold margarita pitcher, and it tasted delicious. I'm still buzzed while writing this review. I ordered a side of guacamole, which tasted good and was definitely made fresh. For my entree, I got the yucatan veggie fajitas. These are THE BEST fajitas I've ever had. The veggies were so fresh and seasoned perfectly. I couldn't stop eating them! Most of the negative reviews comment on the service, but I had no issue with it. Our server was nice, and pretty funny. Our food came out at different times, which was a little awkward, but it was so delicious that I honestly have no complaints. Food is good, service is good, price was okay. A little expensive, but I suppose I did purchase a pitcher. Around 25 dollars for my meal, Guac, and a pitcher split. (Yes, I did have leftovers, so the portions were good- enough for two meals) Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"TOTAL RIPOFF!   ITs the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to In the last 30 years. The service is absolutely horrible you sit at your table and wait and have to go to the front desk and find for servers chatting while the tables are not being serviced. We  ordered combination dinners and were charged additional for rice and beans $2 each !  place is a total rip-off! When I complain to the manager it was futile. There are many Mexican restaurants in the Fairlawn area,  area don't go near this one,  the food is awful also!"}
{"text":"I've come here countless times with friends to enjoy dinner.  Their salsa is usually very spot on. Not too spicy, which is how I like it. The chips often come out pretty fresh. The food tends to be very very salty. I find myself drinking lots of water during and after leaving Tito's.  After I told them to start making my meals with low salt, they've come back perfectly.  The lunch portion fajitas Yucatan had LOTS of vegetables and it's large enough to fill a person up. I've tried the one with chicken, steak and shrimp. Steak is the best tasting one for sure.  During dinner, you can order it plus an additional $0.75. It's a very good deal."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. My tip is to order something with chorizo. Theirs is excellent. It really had a nice mix of smokey and spicy flavor. The dish I ordered was their Nachos Mexicanos (sp?). It practically was a list of all of my favorite things topping nachos; avocado, beans, chorizo, steak, sauteed onions, cheese and more were just a delicious combo. The service was fast and all our orders have been right every time we've gone there. Not bad prices, a nice atmosphere and plenty of food for a second meal. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Dropped in on Cinco de Mayo. The place was packed.

I've been in north east Ohio for a year and this is the best Mexican restaurant yet. I'm from Southern California where I grew up on awesome Mexican food."}
{"text":"Have been to Tito's several times. Salsa and chips are great. Food is good. We went for *Happy Hour* with a coupon that advertised *half off margaritas.* Ordered same; fairly good. Bill came with the margaritas at full price. We questioned the waitress and were told *half price for LIME margaritas, not strawberry ones.* Showed her the coupon that said nothing about the difference, and were told *It's on the website.* Be sure to go on Weds. for half-price pitchers of lime margaritas."}
{"text":"As a pregnant woman craving some acceptable Mexican cuisine (I know we are in Ohio, so I'm not even going to lie to myself and think I can find the Mexican food we have available in my home town of Los Angeles), I decided to give Tito's a try. 

I ordered the two enchilada special - one cheese and one chicken. The chicken enchilada had a 2 inch piece of bone nestled in the shredded chicken pieces along with chunks of onion and some sort of greenish pepper. The tortillas were soggy and the cheese was nothing I had ever experienced. I paid extra for beans and only took a few bites. I left most of the food on my plate and filled up on chips so I wouldn't leave starving. 

Service was not attentive, despite the fact that I visited on a rather quiet Friday afternoon. No one came around to see if I needed a refill on my iced tea, and I had to flag down the server to bring me my check after I stood up and finally made eye contact with another waitress who told my waiter that I was ready to leave. I definitely won't be back, since I Taco Bell can do a far superior job in satisfying any Mexican cravings I have from now on."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Tito's for years. We always have great food and efficient wait staff. I really enjoy the atmosphere and I think they handle the traffic well when they are extremely busy."}
{"text":"Love the Guacamole! Food is always fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Just checked this place out for the first time tonight. The food was good, the atmosphere is welcoming (and clean!), but our server is awful. 

I ordered the Texas Special which came with a chimichanga and something rellena (I can't remember what it was called). Both were tasty, made fresh. The cheese dip was good, but the guacamole that came with my meal left something to be desired. I wanted a mojito, but they're out of mint.

Our server has been to our table three times total so far: once to take our drink order, once to drop off the check, and once to pick the check up. Never checked on us. He gives off the impression that he's here as a favor to US. 

May come back if we're in the area and wanting Mexican, but I will definitely ask for another server if we get stuck with him again."}
{"text":"Update:  revisited the snapper ceviche last week and it was not as fresh as before.  It tasted pretty fishy (think sardines), and I would definitely not recommend it any more.  The rest of our meal was very good.  We had a  poblano chicken dish, which we really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. Service is attentive and portions are generous. 
Fajitas were delicious- we'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Happy hour, that is what this is for me..... Make that a happy fourish hours... ;)

I come here to sit back, chop it up with the owner and crew, whom are super chill and friendly. I may grab a bite from time to time, less likely however... Really this is all about Astro Traveling, how high can we go on the rocket ship of Tequila and Mixed drinks... probably high enough to erase the hard work week or maybe enough to level out the wonderful work week... what ever the choices, a great place to grab a simple appetizer and drink!

The food here is more Tex Mex... which is not surprising for the area, chances are a real Mexican food adventure would leave people questioning too much! LOL 

Tex Mex is more reliable for the steak and potattas crew...and for that I expect exactly that!  Simple, easy, food.."}
{"text":"EDIT (3/30/13): It seems that Tito's has gone pretty downhill, as many of the Mexican restaurants in the Akron area do.

I went there last night, and had a not so great experience.  The food was meh, when it once had been extraordinary.  It just isn't nearly as flavorful as it once was.

The number of people in the restaurant reflects this.  Before, I would have to wait about a half hour to get a table.  Now, I can walk right in.  On a Saturday night.  Plus, when you wake up at three in the morning with a bad stomachache from this food, you know it probably isn't too great.  

Maybe it was just the dish I got, but it was once much better than the recent times I have gone to Tito's.

Sorry Tito's, but there are other Mexican restaurants in the area much better and more consistent than you."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here frequently.  The dining area is clean and well kept.  The servers are friendly (sometimes too friendly - they get slow when the talk).  The food is excellent.  It is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Akron.  

Casa del Rio in Wadsworth is still my favorite in Ohio and Uncle Julio's in Grapevine, TX is my all time favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This is your average 'authentic' Mexican restaurant. The food on the menu is nearly identical to every other Mexican restaurant locally and across the country. The food is prepared quickly and served hot. The flavors are muddled together, and there isn't much that stands out. Chips are plentiful but the salsa could use some salt and spice. The bar is small and the times I've been there usually whoever is working the bar will focus on a few customers and ignore the others. If you are in Fairlawn and want a quick meal without much fuss, this place meets the minimum standards."}
{"text":"I would not suggest this place. The service was extremely slow, the food was subpar, and our waiter was very lazy. I have a dietary restriction and when I asked a question about a few meals he simply told me he didn't know, when I asked if he could find out he said he was \"pretty sure\" which for my dietary restriction isn't an okay answer. He wouldn't go check for me. 
I give this 2 stars because I suppose it could always be worse, but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very good mexican food...extensive menu, enormous portions, great service, decent drink selection, chips and salsa seem to be homemade. Good prices, decent ambience."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Mexican restaurant. Very family friendly and the food is unbelievable. We recently went back in for our 1 year olds birthday and it could not have been a better experience. Our server Mr. Diamond was one of the best we've ever had. The entire staff was friendly and engaging and treated our kids like they were their own.  I would say with much confidence that this is the best Mexican restaurant in the entire Akron area."}
{"text":"We love Tito's!  Always great food and friendly, attentive staff.  Great margaritas at great prices."}
{"text":"The staff here is top notch. They're super friendly and nice, attentive but not in your face. The food is a  bit above the normal mexican fare, and their top shelf margaritas are delish. I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best food but it wasn't the worst. The salsa tastes more like tomato sauce than salsa. Service was fine and everyone was friendly. Ordered and chimichanga and a steak taco. The chimichanga was small, but the taco was decent. I asked for a side of sour cream and they brought me a queso bowl full of sour cream and charged me $1.99 for it when all I needed/expected was a spoonful. 

Overall I would say small portions and over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"It's a great Mexican restaurant mixed among the many shops and stores in fairlawn.  The staff was very hospitable and friendly. It was a great place to take our friend for her birthday.  The menu prices were quite reasonable and the portion sizes left us all feeling full. It can get busy on weekend nights, but not too difficult to get a table. Great place!"}
{"text":"We love titos! They have amazing Mexican food. We often order takeout and are sad when the small container of salsa ends. This last time we found out you could order a medium sized drink cup of salsa for I think 5$ or less. It was worth it. We've eaten there many times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty par for the course, as far as Mexican food in Ohio goes. My issue, however, is with the wait staff. 

We asked the host how long of a wait we would have. When he told us, we said no problem, we'll go elsewhere. Out of nowhere, the manager comes up and says no, we'll seat you now. Which would have been fine, except he was SO RUDE to his coworker. 

Then, our waiter: he was more concerned with hitting on every woman in the place than he was with being quick or efficient. He had a large party come in after us, and proceeded to tell us to hurry up, because he'd be busy with them. We waited 20 minutes after eating for our check. 

I personally will not return to Tito's. There are other restaurants in this city with good food and the service to match."}
{"text":"Our first trip there, excellent food and service. We will definitely be regulars. Love the warm chips, nice touch."}
