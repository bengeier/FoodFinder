{"text":"Maybe I over ordered.  Started with a Negroni. Then Burmese Tea salad. Delicious.  Edamame, not too salty.  Squash steamed dumplings, pan fried pork dumpling. Fried chicken spring rolls.  Are it all. High recommend"}
{"text":"I wasn't wowed by Soba ... the food and service were okay but not outstanding. The vibe was much \"trendier\" than my wife and I had expected, and perhaps this contributes to the dining clientele. We were unfortunately seated next to a borderline unpleasant, inebriated and and rather \"bro-ey\" table of guys and gals which detracted from our experience. I reckon the feel of the place appeals more to others than to me, so take this review with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"So far, this is the closest that I have been able to come to a meal in Pittsburgh that even resembles a meal in San Francisco.    Open Table for my reservation....check. Found plenty of free street parking on a Sunday eve....check. Plenty of seating available for a 6pm reservation....check.  Didn't know they had a patio!  Beautiful upstairs setting for a warm summer evening.  It appears they also have a gas heater on the patio for chilling nights of dining as well.    I started with a chopped salad.....very San Francisco....mango, cucumber, papaya, mint, avocado, cashews and a miso dressing.    The waitress brought over, \"complements of the kitchen\", a yellow/orange saucy cucumber sampling with pita squares.  Not bad for just a taste.    I ordered the Alaskan Halibut which was amazing.  Not the absolute best I've ever had, but it was pretty high up there on the list....especially in a city where fried foods are the norm.  And there was plenty on my plate to fill me up...no room for dessert.  I would definitely return, especially if entertaining out-of-towners."}
{"text":"I rave about this place. I have not had one dish that I was not impressed by and have visited several times now. I take anyone who comes to visit me from out of town here. The lounge is a great place to grab a drink (just as good as the food). Not only is this my favorite restaurant of the Big Burrito family, but it is my new favorite in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh!  The corn chowder and filet are winners! The service is always top notch and the bar scene is great!"}
{"text":"I ate here 3 days ago and I'm still thinking about it!  Excellent service, decor, ambiance, etc.  Excellent food.  I'm craving the scallop soba noodles I had.  And of course...  CHOCOLATE MAKI ROLL!  *sigh*  This place loses 1 star because I can't afford to go here as much as I'd like."}
{"text":"Soba got a lot really nice reviews so my wife and I decided to try it out while visiting pittsburgh.  The atmosphere and ambience are cool and really nice.  While the portion sizes are large and food is beautifully plated, the dishes really just average. The ingredients and flavors of two dishes we are needed balancing very badly.  If you're sensitive to spicy food beware because every dish was spicy and geared for bold flavor.  We had the Burmese Salad, Miso Black Cod and the Cantonese noodles with beef.  The salad was very creative and with a little tender care and adjustment to the ingredients it could be a really nice dish (too many spices added and too little dressing/vinegarette). The Miso Black Cod filet was the highlight of the dish (prefectly cooked, beautiful taste) but unfortunately it was massively overpowered by the super strong gochujong sauce that drenched the rest of the dish. While the piece of fish was really nice, the rest of the dish was too extreme and lacked the finesse of a decent arrangement.  The Cantonese noodles were pretty good and our favorite out the three dishes.  The beef was nicely marinated and cooked perfectly to give a nice tenderness.  The noodles seemed they provably came from a package and were a bit too thin (unlike traditional beef ho fun) so nothing special there.    While the service was great and the dishes were presented beautifully, the ingredient combinations did not mesh well enough for good fusion with balanced flavors and the prices were too high."}
{"text":"Made reservations on a busy Saturday night (3/5) for me and my girlfriend....it was our first time eating out in Pittsburgh (out of towners) and Soba exceeded my expectations (coming from SoCal where there's Asian fusion joints everywhere).   The Coat Check for ladies and free parking was awesome....the tandoori grilled salmon was impeccable....and this place is getting 5 Stars from me mainly for its outrageously delicious and homemade \"Soba banana split.\" That's right, homemade chocolate, roasted pineapple, and jasmine-green tea ice cream scoops on top of banana cake and creme-bruleed (crunchy) bananas. Best dessert we've ever had.   Speciality drinks were pretty outstanding too....thanks Soba!!"}
{"text":"My worst dining experience while working in Pittsburgh. Up until tonight I've thought \"these are the nicest people I've met\" more than any other city I've worked in recently. Soba's staff has cured me of that. Food was good not great and my server acted as though my table of one was a bother even though I spent 60 bucks and ate within an hour with a 20% tip. My co workers were interested in checking this place out before we all head back to Los Angeles but I'll let them all know it's not worth a visit. Pittsburgh has some great restaurants but this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Used to love the inventive --if quirky and sometimes off the mArk ---combos of this Asian Fusion place. But now it is about As standard as they come with lamb shank and salmon entrees ... What happened ? After the renovation the place lost its center !  Plus staff is slow and not very  professional  ... Another one bites the dust !  Not likely to return especially when the competition for novel and fun food is on the rise in the burgh!!"}
{"text":"Good consistent meals.  Valet Parking.  The steak and the tuna is awesome!  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"excellent service - so so food, went there two weeks ago.  first let down from (for me) from the big burrito group."}
{"text":"We have been regulars at Soba for years, sharing a few appetizers at the bar-lounge on a quiet evening and enjoying the food. Last night was different. For the very first time the food was awful.  A scallion pancake replaced the kimchee pancake. The chef, who we learned was new, obviously had no idea that a pancake is the glue that holds a tasty morsel together. This was pure glue, tasteless and sticky. Where was the content, the taste, the flavor? The lump-crab egg roll was worthy of a corner take-out Chinese eatery, oily mostly. A pulled pork appetizer was passable, nowhere near the dish it replaced. find a new chef quickly. John E. Raffie."}
{"text":"I have come to Soba a multitude of times ( I believe I am the duchess)  and have always had a wonderful table experience and the food has been out of this world. The hostess has a real attitude problem which is why this review is only 4 stars and not 5. She always seems annoyed and if I had not had such a wonderful food and dining experience I would probably have not returned. The sea scallops are so meaty and the chocolate maki is one of the most surprising and interesting desserts I have ever tasted!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our first visit to Soba yesterday.  On recommendations from a friend we be began dinner with the fried Tofu. Excellent! The lemongrass sauce completed the dish nicely. I had a Dark and Stormy cocktail with it. We ordered the duck and the black cod. Would recommend both. Our waiter was helpful and attentive. We sat on the upstairs patio. Beautiful evening , delicious meal!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Soba this past weekend on a trip to Pittsburgh and I have been dying to return ever since. I wish I could get it shipped here to NJ! The food was definitely some of the best food I have ever had. The drinks were all very interesting as well. Very tasty! We ordered an array of small plates to sample various different things. Each one was better than the next. The spicy tuna maki roll was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The tempura green beans were so delicious too! We sampled everything from soup to salad and Korean BBQ ribs. Everything delicious! We even left room for dessert which was equally amazing. My friend had the sesame ice cream with salted caramel. It sounded strange to me at first but it was so delicious. I had the chocolate make which was so beautifully prepared and delectable although extremely rich with the dark chocolate. Definitely something to share because of the richness, I was only able to eat a few bites. My other friend got the pandan leaf panna cotta. After reading it on the menu, I didn't think it sounded like something I would like. Boy oh boy, was I wrong. It was amazing! I can't wait to return to Pittsburgh to visit Soba again!"}
{"text":"Started in the bar for delicious happy hour cocktails, all of which are Asian variations of classics. The space is calming yet chic and perfect for drinks with friends who like conversation or a date. Dinner was also very good. I had the red curry, which was tasty but I should have ordered it to be spicier. Next time, and there will be a few next times, I'll make a meal from small plates with the sashimi and other fish offerings. The Chilean Sea Bass satay was unbelievably delicious.  It was seviche on a stick in chopstick friendly pieces. There was a subtle smoky flavor to the fish. The service in the bar and in the dining area was attentive and helpful in navigating the menu."}
{"text":"I went there last night to enjoy what I thought would be a romantic night out. Upon walking into soba restaurant I was greeted by the nicest hostess who kindly directed me to the lounge. The lounge was everything it was advertised to be. Many different options of where to sit and a beautiful ambiance that really put us in the right mood. As soon as we sat down we were handed a drink menu with all sorts of options. Went with the Bangkok Tea, was delicious. Now why did I give it 2 stars? Everything sounds great right? Wrong!! The server went out of her way to make us feel uncomfortable. Kept walking over to ask us if we wanted anything else (I ordered 2 drinks while my date got 1). She didn't leave us alone and didn't hide the fact that she wanted us to leave. What's the big idea. At the end she closed our bill early and said that we should tell her if we need anything else. That was our sign to leave. What a way to ruin an otherwise beautiful evening. So my advice to anyone coming to soba at around 6:30pm on a Tues is to watch out for Ashley. Hopefully it was just an off day for her, but it definitely ruined our evening."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Pittsburgh! The crispy  tofu there is so amazing! My next best dish is the thakkali curry.. The drinks specially the Asian plum sangria is fantastic.. Love the ambience! It's like a place in New York. Good veggie options."}
{"text":"This was a great all-around experience.   I visited in late March, but have just now gotten into Yelp.   The wait staff was very knowledgeable and checked up on my party often.  The atmosphere was elegant and the food was extremely well executed.   For an appetizer, I had the tempura fried rock shrimp drizzled in a spicy sauce. They were fried to perfection and the spice was tasty and not overwhelming. For my entrée, I had the tuna tartare with taro root chips. The tuna was evidently fresh and well seasoned and the taro root chips added a nice textural element. My mother had pad Thai, which she says was excellent; pad Thai can so easily be mediocre. For dessert I sampled the condensed milk ice cream and one of their many varieties of tea, I believe it was something with lemongrass (in all honestly, I selected one at random because I was so sure any of them would be delicious, and I was right). If was a lovely finisher to a wonderful meal. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Fusion is difficult to pull off well.  Have you ever noticed that \"Fusion\" almost always involves East Asian food and American cuisine.  Thai corn chowder?  Are they really going crazy for corn chowder in Chang Mai?  You never find, say, Mexican-Moroccan or  Ethiopian-Brazilian fusion places.  That would be really inventive.  Instead, with Soba, you have another pan Asian-American Fusion joint, although I don't think I've been to a better one.  The mussels are incredible, a meal in themselves, and a bargain at $9.    I had the chopped salad, with fresh mango, avocado, mint, and just a hint of spice.  The best meal I've had here was the mussels, followed by the tuna.  The crabcakes are also good, made with lump crabmeat.    If you feel like something vaguely Asian, but not too Asian (ex: kimchee pancakes), you won't find a better option.  But if you want something truly original, you have to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have only eaten a full meal in the dining room once; but I have ordered appetizers and drinks in the comfortable bar area more than a handful of times. On the occasion of the dinner, a dining companion's seared rare tuna was really excellent; I'd recommend ordering that. As for appetizers, I like the lobster maki and the crispy tofu. They also have a great wine list and some good cocktails (I enjoy the plum sangria).   In all, first class food, drinks, service and decor. Now if they could just do something about all the pretentious people who flood the place..."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant, one of the best Big Burrito spots... love the small plates and the idea of being able to grab a drink at some small bites in the bar. The pork dumplings and the the vinegar sauce... to die for!!!  They have a nice happy hour M-F as well.  Good cocktails.  I think many entrees are overpriced, but they are good.  But $24 for a chicken ramen dish... I still get it because it's excellent, but even restaurants in San Francisco and NYC don't charge this much for such a dish.  The Bronzini dish is always excellent and they try to add a few other tasty specials in from time to time... but in my opinion the menu doesn't change too often.  It's a good place to go when you want to get exactly what you want... meaning, whatever you had on the menu last time will probably still be on the menu."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm an out of town visitor that was looking for a good restaurant for the family of 5.  I am huge fish fan and the selection they had was fantastic.  We are koreans so we stayed away from the fusion korean food thinking we probably had better cooked by our mothers.   The wait service was fantastic and very helpful with wine and food list.    The appetizers were o.k.  we got the tomato soup, curry chowder, mushroom buns, baby octopus.  Baby octopus was great but other were ok.   The nice waiter recommended a new fish dish that had braised the whole fish, which was excellent.  I'm a huge fish fan and it was so tender and flavored.  I tried some of the tuna steak, but it was okay. And some of the noodle dishes were fantastic and good size.    I would recommend it for special occasions because it was pretty price, but I really did like the fish dishes they had."}
{"text":"Easily one of the better places in town and parallels great Asian around the country. Certainly not quite up to Hakkasan or Nobu standards, but on a trajectory. I have been happy nearly every time and have been here about a dozen times over the last year. Bar staff very attentive and good. My favorites are Bao buns, filet satay, dumplings, Burmese tea leaf salad , most of the sushi and sashimi , some noodle dishes. Haven't really gone through the entrees in a while, but I'm sure they are very good. All in all , a great dining experience 4.5/5)."}
{"text":"Good food, inventive, well presented and something for every palate. Great tandoori salmon, braised pork dim sum, sea bass satay and miso cod.   I think however that for the price you pay, the service should also be of the same standard. We were served our meals but not our wine. We had empty water glasses.  The tablecloth was wrinkled.   We will return but it's not going to be a high priority."}
{"text":"Been coming to this restaurant for years, before the fire that caused the entire renovation of the place you now go to.   Obviously, I like the food, good quality, a perfect serving size, and the amuse bouche is a nice touch!  The wine selection by the glass is pretty decent.  Service is always great.  The bar area is fun and definitely a place for young professionals out for a drink, to hang, and to meet others.  At night, for the late-night menu, you can even get a few selections made from their neighbors, Umi!"}
{"text":"Outstanding dining experience.  Soba Lounge is our favorite place for anything special.  Just give us a reason, any reason to drive in from Greensburg.  Yes prices are higher than the average everyday restaurant, but the food is a culinary delight.  Each entree and side treats your taste buds with many flavors.  The seared rare tuna is my favorite.  The filet melts in your mouth.  Crispy tofu and Tai corn chowder are must haves for appitizers.  Don't forget to order the Soba Banana Split to share.  Ian did an excellent job as our server."}
{"text":"Well... The pad Thai was OK. Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap it was not. Baby puke with delicious beef? Hard to place it. Bizarre watery consistency. Shiitake was good too. Way too much hype for such underwhelming food. Service was so-so too."}
{"text":"Great food, cocktails and dessert. I hope to come back here again!"}
{"text":"I've been impressed with all of the Big Burrito restaurant group and so far my favorite is Soba.   The interior is a lot nicer than the exterior space. I've driven down Ellsworth a million times and would not have imagined zen/dark themed interior restaurant (especially with their obnoxiously loud yellow, caps, bold exterior signage that says SOBA on moss green wall).  My husband and I shared a sake, lobster maki, seared tuna w/ kimchi, and scallop udon. All yum. We were also surprised by the generous entree portions.   What made my experience at Soba so great was the dessert menu. As much as I love dessert and sweets, I typically do not like a lot of ingredients used for desserts (ie. nuts, chocolates, raisin, certain fruits, cinnamon, & other spices). But when I saw their dessert menu, I craved almost all of them. Although my husband and I usually share one dessert, we decided on two. We had the cream brulee and dark chocolate mousse maki. Both were ridiculously scrumptious."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here recently to celebrate his birthday. We decided on the crispy tofu and the four-course tasting menu they were offering for the Chinese New Year. Every single course, from the dumplings to the dessert was delicious. Our server was very polite and knowledgable as we're the food runners. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pan-Asian fusion.  That designation usually means fancy Chinese food at high-end prices. Even in Boston and Chicago, $30 was a lot for an entree.  So to have the same prices in the 'Burgh, the \"Most Livable City,\" I would expect to be knocked off my feet.  Or, maybe, I'm just a cheap bastard.  I tried all the appetizers, and they were all excellent.  The portion sizes for both the appetizers and the entrees were generous.  The spring rolls, crabcakes, spinach dumplings, et al. come with 6 servings each.  I think most people enjoyed their entrees.  I had the seared tuna, which was a big piece.  It was prepared pretty well, and had nice sides of pickled cucumbers and kim chi.  The sides were really good -- but I've also had these items store-bought, and they tasted almost as good.  Service was excellent and the waitstaff was nice and accomodating.  I also appreciated the decor and atmosphere, something I normally don't prioritize.  It's definitely a swanky place.  In short, very good food, but for me, who averages $13/hr for my salary, I'd rather eat somewhere with a better price/taste ratio."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants while working in Pittsburgh.  The decor is incredibly sexy and the food is delicious.  I don't think we ordered one bad thing."}
{"text":"*****This is what fusion Asian cuisine should be! ***** The chef is very innovative. Try the Tandoori Salmon or the Long Island Duck with bokchoy. The greatest surprise is the Thakkali curry, Asian veggies in fragrant curry sauce. Sumptuous meals and great presentation."}
{"text":"So underwhelming. I've been here a few times and have always been disappointed. Last night the service was especially lackluster. And the kitchen closed and 10, so no snacks for us later in the evening . They do make a good French Martini though."}
{"text":"Soba is Big Burrito's take on Asian fusion.  As with everything concerning Big Burrito, Soba is excellent in all departments.  It is next door to Umi (Big Burrito's sushi place) in a trendier area of Shadyside.  The space is elegant--a waterfall adorns the interior.  Lighting is dark as is the decor--as with most Big Burrito establishments.  There is plenty of space between tables and such--you can take a date here and you should.  The food is excellent.  Dishes are inventive (not your normal Asian fusion dishes here) and well presented.  The quality of the ingredients is top-notch (my tuna tar tare tasted very fresh).  As a note, tasting menus are not available--two specials seemed to offered every night.  The menu seems to change by season as well.  Soba's wine and whiskey selection is extensive--10 pages for wine, 4 for whiskey.  The service is excellent, as is to be expected.  Really, everything here is great.  You should go at least once, Soba is a gem in the rough of the Pittsburgh dining scene."}
{"text":"Good beer specials when I've had their beer specials for the night.  Appetizers & entrees are usually perfectly sized, if not a little large.  The one exception is the fried calamari - the plate was probably about twice the size it needed to be!  The complementary small-portioned appetizer (I know there's a name for that, but can't think of it off the top of my head) is always been delicious.  The seafood is extremely fresh, and all of the flavors are very good.  Attentive (but not at all annoying) service with friendly waitstaff, nice decor, and a great atmosphere for parties sized from 2 to 20."}
{"text":"Part I of two - the restaurant.  I've dined here quite often. The ambience is nice. The food is comparatively bad. Greasy and soggy. They call it 'Asian fusion' = random combinations of ingredients, some 'Asian' others not so much. Just because you add soy sauce or rice noodles won't make it Asian. Two stars for the food.  Part II of two - the bar.  Best cocktails in the Burgh. Hands down. They are artisans. There is Plymouth gin. The Sobatini, a ginger-martini, is healthy enough to count as vitamin tonic. Clean, tangy, and refreshing.   Advice: skip the restaurant, have a few drinks at the bar, eat from the bar menu if you must eat. I usually end up having drinks at Soba and then dinner at Eleven, another of their restaurants."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with the quality... the salad was drenched in vinegar, the duck was mediocre.  I guess I'm used to really good food from foodie towns.  If I wanted mediocre food, I would go to fridays or olive garden-- was it comparable?  Yes, for quality of food.  The price, obviously, was much more.  This fake fusion place would have gone out of business, regardless of price, if it had to compete with the likes of Slanted Door or was located in a city with good food.  If this is representative of the best Pittburgh has to offer, then take the money you would have spent here and reinvest it in a trip to SF or NYC and eat well for a week. How sad is that?  Don't go here... you pay $30 for an entree, $10 for an appetizer, and $15 for a mediocre wine.  Not worth it..."}
{"text":"My first trip to Soba was as a +1 at a Yelp Elite event (yay!).  The event occupied the bar area, which was lovely, had ample seating, and a beautiful (well stocked) bar.  The food and drink provided was well designed to represent some of the better tastes of the menu.  We chose a poor table, and tended to get the ends of each service, but ultimately, we were well fed and pampered by the end.  The shishito peppers were truly outstanding.  Lovely and smokey, but not too spicy.  The rock shrimp tempura and seared rare tuna were tasty and definitely worth getting, but the highlight (for me) was the bao buns.  Dear Lord. The dough was light and soft, the chicken deliciously fried, and then my brain kinda melted into nirvana rather than thinking about the other ingredients.  We also sampled the edamame, spicy tuna roll and a vegetarian roll, which were good, but sort of as expected and not my favorite.  We also sampled the plum sangria (very tasty), the thai mule (very gingery, delicious, and my favorite!!), and the midnight manhattan (amazing, if you're a rye drinker).  For dessert, we all received a chocolate maki, which was very creative, well presented, and good.  A nearby yelper had a birthday, which called for a soba banana split.  After the banana split, which was truly outstanding, we were all left a big jealous.   Also of note, their happy hour specials were good.  A nice selection of reasonably priced cocktails, wine, beer, and beer on tap.  I would definitely come back for a nice dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"I have dinned Soba on multiple occasions and it never disappoints.  I really like the decor (very fitting for menu served) and the wait staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. Since my standard practice is to ask what their favorite dishes and the most popular dishes are, a waitress/waiter that can give a detailed response is a big plus.    The wine menu is very thorough and my wife and i can always find a bottle that is both of high quality and reasonably priced.  For apps, we usually split the grilled baby octopus, if you have never had it, i highly suggest it.   I was a little surprised on my most recent visit that they have removed the Sea Scallop entree from the menu,  my wife and i had both planned on getting this meal that evening.  I hope it returns soon, however, and a big however, the scallops were replaced with the miso black cod, which was absolutely fantastic.  one of those meals where eat bite is better than the next, the bbq ribs and noodles remain from the scallop dish but i believe there was a llittle more spice in this dish.  I also believe this is the famous miso black cod from next door at Umi, i could be wrong.   get this entree, it is amazing.    In summary, Soba is great for a nice meal out, food is top notch, some of the best you will find in Pittsburgh, and of course i will return soon, yet again."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a regular here. I'd like to give it 5 stars, but almost every time I go my friends and I get frustrated with the service, so I had to knock it down to 4 stars. The servers are extremely inattentive.  We always sit in the bar/lounge area, which is beautifully decorated and has quite a fresh, relaxing vibe.  The drinks and food are excellent -- I've only had 1 slightly bad food experience here out of probably 15 visits. During happy hour, drinks are cheaper and we always get a few apps to share. The food is really outstanding, full of flavors and VERY unique for Pittsburgh. I love it! Go!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. The portions were large. Cocktails were great. Fantastic environment. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Great place to go for a foodie night out, romantic dinner. But ALSO - a great bar with a very cool, upscale vibe. Fantastic cocktails, excellent service, nice staff."}
{"text":"I don't see the big deal about Soba Lounge. I thought the food was only okay, and I didn't like all of the flavors overpowering each other. The ambience is really nice, and the servers are friendly, but the food was just alright for me."}
{"text":"Soba is beautiful, simply stunning. This time I sat solo at the bar for happy hour. You really can't beat $6 glasses of wine and cocktails. The Thai mule cocktail was so refreshing and smelled exactly like a delicious fragrant Thai dish. Please keep this cocktail on the menu for summer....this is the perfect summertime drink. Even though it is 15 degrees out, I'll continue to drink at Soba in the winter and let them transport me away to somewhere warmer :)"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong in a Big Burrito restaurant! Well, unless you are  looking for your Mexican friend's grandma's cooking at Mad Mex. Soba is probably my fave BB restaurant (I haven't been to Umi yet). I love creative foods and drinks and Soba delivers here. It's about 17-item small plates list seems extensive, because you would want to try every one of them. We shares six small plates for dinner - grilled octopus, Vietnamese shrimp and squid, yellowtail sashimi, lobster maki, Korean bbq ribs and calamari. The Viet shrimps were quite overcooked - kind of like when you try cooking the chilled cooked shrimps. It's sauce and the accompaniments were amazing though. The ribs were a big hit, crispy, tender and not fatty. I wish the sashimi was a little bigger in portion and the calamari about half the amount they offer. The portions, except for the sashimi were \"Pittsburgh portions\". I almost had to be rolled back home; I was that full, and happy. If I am to spend $100+ on dinner, then I want to be this happy that I would want to write a yelp review the very next morning."}
{"text":"This is officially one of my favorite \"special occasion\" restaurants in the city.  Both times my BF and I have been here, we have ordered the tasting menu.  The first time was the \"Water Festival\" that was fabulous.  The second time was for Valentines weekend.  I like the tasting menu because it forces me to try things that I wouldn't normally order.  I am not a fan of the gamey taste of lamb or the texture of scallops and mushrooms....but when its done right, like it is at Soba, I fall in love and realize what I am missing.  My BF and I usually order one of each item and switch back and forth so we get to taste 7 dishes in all.   Highly recommend the tasting menu."}
{"text":"Food is way over priced. Lobster tacos.... $14 for (2) tacos put together equalled 4 inches lol.... Sushi was very good tho..... Mule drinks $12 for 4oz .... This place is a rip off.... $80 for 2 people and had to go somewhere else to eat afterwards because we were still hungry. This is a show off place at best. Show off how much money you can waste in a night ."}
{"text":"This place is extremely overrated. First off, it is WAY overpriced -- I should not have to pay $25 for a subpar dish of chewy pork with an \"asian\" sauce that was basically a ton of sugar and not much else. The salmon was OK but not worth the $25 either.  The only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that the waitstaff were very friendly and the appetizer was original and tasty (carrot/ginger soup). In fact, if I ever went back (which I won't) I would probably just order a few appetizers and go home happy and not broke.  I know good thai food, and good asian fusion food, and this place is just not it."}
{"text":"I'm the first person to stick my nose up at Asian fusion, but hot dang, I had a wonderful meal here.   Hamachi sashimi appetizer - Delectable! Raw fish paired with avocado and an interesting garlic sauce for a bit of salt. Yum yum yum.   Korean barbecue ribs - Fall off the bone. Unbelievably tender.   Seared rare tuna - Almost 2 inches thick, and totally rare on the inside, with a crust of sesame seeds. Brilliant idea. Kimchi on the side for a flavor punch, and ginger fried rice was tasty too.   Ambiance was contemporary, intimate, and cozy. Dark lighting sets the mood for a date, but I came here with family and still loved it. Upstairs patio was a bit muggy in the summer, but has nice views."}
{"text":"Delicious! Came here for a date night while visiting family for the holidays. Great food and drinks and the atmosphere is fancy yet still cozy."}
{"text":"THE place that I went for a nice conversation + cocktail combo in the 'burgh. Great atmosphere, great drinks, great food. Ahh, Soba. If only all Pittsburgh restaurants could be like you, the world would be a better place."}
{"text":"Had dinner there 12/22/2012. Started with seared scallops and chopped salad.   Scallops were cooked perfectly and tasted quite good. Chopped salad with mango, avocado, lettuce, cilantro was light and refreshing and perhaps the best part of the meal. Entrees were the black cod and the seafood stew.  Black cod was cooked well but the sauce lacked something - it could have tasted delicate and light but instead tasted charred.  The seafood in the stew was cooked well - scallops, shrimp and mussels were done perfectly - but again the broth lacked something to brighten it. Service and ambiance were nice.  For a young hip vibe I would ask for downstairs seating. All in all I would say the food was very good, not great. We will try again in the summer with a different menu."}
{"text":"Soba is hit or miss for me. The cocktails are awesome, particularly when $6 during happy hour. You can't beat lavendar syrups and St Germain. I've had some great dishes - the corn soup and the pad thai- but some have flopped. The lamb stew, for example, had delicious flavor but besides the veggies was almost inedible because the lamb was tough as leather. I feel like mistakes like this shouldn't happen at these prices."}
{"text":"Veg Standpoint - From the start the ambience was great.  The food was huge portions so order less and order more if need be.  There are a few veg dishes which were nice but not amazing.  Still great place to go.  Good romantic dinner."}
{"text":"We go there for our 5th anniversary. The service is very good, foods are very tasty. Lobster taco is highly recommended. I like their duck dish, it's very tender and juicy, eat with crispy house made flat bread. Chocolate pretzels stack is very good too."}
{"text":"WoW! This place really makes me happy. First Time here and I will be a long time patron. Thanks a lot for a very nice meal.  Even though I came here on a Monday night I can imagine that this place gets packed so if I were you I would make a reservation, I guess I just always make a reservation if I can get one at a time that works for me as I did on a Monday even though I don't think that it was warranted.   Right from the get go I was pleased with the ambiance of this place. We showed up early and went to have a drink at the bar were we received very friendly unrushed service from the bar tender. I had a few questions about what was on tap and they were very knowledgeable which I can appreciate.   After we finished our drinks we headed over to check in for dinner and we were seated immediately. Soon afterward we were greeted by a really cool and professional waiter. I thought that it was great that he had a really good understanding of the menu at Soba and had no problem discussing the different items to help us make a decision.   We started with the crispy tofu, spicy tuna Maki, and grilled baby octopus. All were tasty bites. The crispy tofu was by all means excellent, the only thing was that the sauce that the tofu bits are tossed in takes away from any sort of characteristic that reflects crispiness. I might ask next time to have the sauce on the side. The Octopus was like it was fished out of the sea the day we ate it. It was a nice light dish that was tender the way an octopus should be. Thanks for that by the way, I hate choking on rubbery seafood. The Spicy tuna maki was also beautiful and tasty and would almost recommend this appetizer over the other two that we had if you had to only choose one. Over all 3 appetizers was way too much for us.  I don't order steak out that much but I said what the heck I'm going to see what this place has got. I ordered Medium-Rare like an aristocrat would. And once again they didn't let me down. Perfecto and the chili mashed potatoes, well I wish that I could drink them or get them via I.V. they were so good but I was so stuffed. Darn it! I tried some of the Seared Rare Tuna, oooooo! that was soo good as well, next time I may get that. All in all, heck of a great meal and I will be back sooner rather than later as there is a large menu to choose from.   I was also very happy by the friendliness as well as the professionalism of the valet service. The guy had my car out super fast and had my car configured just the way I had left it with the wheels turned for the getaway.   Go check it out for yourself I can't imagine that you will not get anything less than the best of service and quality here."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better and more upscale modern Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh (excluding Thai food- so many good options). This was my first time at Soba after spending many visits at Umi. I would argue that Umi is the better sibling with excellent sushi options (with a hefty price tag) but Soba is a bit more approachable to the person who is less familiar with or doesn't want sushi. In all, it's a good place for a date with a desire for reasonable and modern Asian fusion.   Ambience: Trendy, dimly lit and very clean decor. It suits the cuisine and is well set for small groups or a date. Not too loud but certainly not dead either. I loved the bar area- has a mix of bar and casual couch/lovechair seating that's well suited for a date or small group. Based on the clientele and set up, I'd lean towards trendy attire if you come here- not a casual place by any means.   Food: Thai corn chowder- so good and very rich. I would return just for that dish. For an entree, I had the seared rare tuna. They definitely didn't skimp on my portion of tuna and cooked it well. Granted tuna is a bit bland, I was hoping for more seasoning and oomph from the Korean barbecue sauce. The ginger fried rice made up for any disappointment I had with the tuna. For dessert, the chocolate pretzel stack was fantastic- perfect mix of chocolate, sweet caramel and the salty wonton chip.   Drinks: The old fashioned was well-executed. Went back for a second. Can't speak for any of their other cocktails."}
{"text":"Soba is usually my pick to use my free entree coupon from the Big Burrito restaurant group and there's a reason I keep going back. It's fantastic! It's a bit pricey, but not stuffy or pretentious at all. Their food menu changes daily and takes advantage of local and seasonal ingredients, but if they ever get rid of the Chocolate Pretzel Stack desert, they might have a mutiny on their hands! Their recent remodel really opened up the space, yet it still feels very cozy. The servers are always friendly and attentive and I've never had a bad experience here. Definitely a great \"special occasion\" or romantic restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food is consistently great and there are always new and interesting things on the menu."}
{"text":"I went to Soba with some co-workers on a work trip to Pittsburgh. The wine selection was pretty impressive (there was something for every taste) and the food was good. Not the best pad thai I've ever eaten (pretty dry, like it had been sitting a while) but my co-workers enjoyed their meals. Would go back again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"appetizers were great!!! Entrees were just ok to be honest. Desserts were definitely good ate on the Deck great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am new to Yelp - even though I haven't been to Soba in awhile it is my absolute favorite place to go for a nicer meal in Pittsburgh.  If I ever have the choice - the Seared Ahi Tuna with BBQ would be my last meal on earth.  The atmosphere, the service, the food, the drinks (Pickle Martini!), everything is always on point.  I highly recommend Soba!"}
{"text":"A great way to spend the night.  Loved the seafood salad with soba noodles.   Asian cloppino and the filet have never disappointed.  Would love to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"ANOTHER GOOD EATERY FROM THE BIG BURRITO GROUP.  We went to celebrate my bros girlfriends b-day. BECAUSE if you sign up for the big burrito birthday club you get a yearly $30 birthday voucher for most of the big burrito restaurants!!!  Any who...this place has a high end warm feeling. Menu had alot to choose from in the way of Asian fusion. We tried the calamari which was good. Chopped salad was refreshing but not everyone at the table liked it. I had scallops - large and well cooked. Dessert was show only. The cashew terrine was so so. I would love to try more of the small plates. I felt the entire place was good enough to visit again."}
{"text":"We booked a table for 4 and the service was great. Everything we ordered was delicious (nigori sake, crispy tofu, filet satays, double salmon roll, lobster roll, wild Alaska halibut, Long Island duck, vege fried rice, and banana split). The vege fried rice was a bit saltier than we expected, though. The chef even gave us an extra plate of salmon roll for the appetizer waiting time. The server suggested nigori sake (as we go sweet) and it was very nice. Amazing experience :-)"}
{"text":"I am giving Soba 5 stars for the experience I had there, even though I'm not quite sure the food deserves the whole 5 stars (Maybe 4.5) My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary. We are poor college students we got dressed up for our special dinner. We ordered several small plates: the Indonesian corn fritter wrap, the spicy tuna maki, the chicken and vegetable spring rolls, the korean barbecue ribs, and... something else!  The ribs were probably the best, and the corn fritter and tuna maki were also great. I was disappointed by the spring rolls - they were of good quality, but they were somewhat bland, and I expect a little more at a place (and a price!) like this.  For dessert we had the vanilla-poached peach with raspberry granita, coconut tapioca and brown sugar-barley crisps - this was fabulous! The combination of textures and flavors was superb. This appears to no longer be on the menu. The real treat of the evening was the service we got from our waiter. We wanted to order sake, but we are sake noobs and had no idea where to start. Our waiter brought us a tasting tray of three very different sakes, all of which were delicious. We made a decision, ordered a carafe, and settled down to eat and drink and, uh, gaze lovingly into each other's eyes. As we were finishing our small plates, the waiter sidled up to our table and replaced our empty carafe with a full one, winking at us and saying \"Will you look at that!\"  We were very pleased with our experience at Soba and it made a great anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"Dear Pittsburgh, we are foodies from Boston.  The wonderful thing about living in a city like Boston is that there are few chain restaurants, but infinite amounts of local-owned restaurants with hip atmosphere and delicious food made with fresh ingredients and a whole lotta passion.  I understand you're hard up, but this place made your list of top 25 restaurants in the city?  Seriously?  The decor looked much like many homes in the suburbs outside your city-a little bit o' this and a little bit o' that, but that is beside the point.  Swarmy waiters you have to flag down for service (and by the way, the locals were having to do it too) is not charming or cool.  It's unacceptable.  Especially when a restaurant has the audacity to charge what this place was for a crappy meal.  And I'm telling you, other than the Thai corn chowder, this food was barely edible.  What with all the Kings and Eat-n-Parks you may not know this, but trust me, a visitor from the land of delicious, this is just gross.  And to pay anywhere over $100 for gross (or even anywhere edging up to $100) is just a slap in the face.  It's time for Pittsburgh to get standards that are above ground.  A restaurant like just should be nowhere near your top 25."}
{"text":"Made reservations at Soba for my birthday dinner.  Started out with appetizers of Sushi and Pork Dumplings. The sushi is by far the best. So fresh, very sizable portion, and plain out delicious. The Pork dumplings were good too! For my entree I had the Thai chicken curry, and it was so good! Definitely a dish that takes your taste buds on an adventure. I actually got stuffed on the appetizers so I actually basically took my meal home. I would love to go back, but I honestly would probably order two or three orders of sushi because it was so delicious!  I do recommend making reservations, as it did get busier as the night went on. They sat us on the quieter side of the restaurant, as I had no idea that the restaurant has so many different seating rooms!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a nice birthday dinner. I thought it would have mire Japanese options on the menu being named soba.   I ordered the black truffle-potato samosa which was not bad.   I also had the chopped salad which I suprisingly really enjoyed despite it being iceburgh lettuce which is definitely not what I use for a good salad. I wish they didn't put fried batter all over it though.   Last I had the vegetarian curry dish, the only vegetarian main I found. It was boring and not enough curry gravy with plain white rice! No delicious fragrant jasmine rice....Also deep fried the Naan, didn't enjoy that. The potatoes were also undercooked with not much flavor in the dish overall.   We were put at a table in the very corner of the third floor and all I had to stare at was a wall and an ugly floating tv hutch. It was very cold.  We were the first people in the restaurant but took FOREVER to get served. Everything took a long time to come out and the service was very poor.   Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I heard umi is also one of their restaurants and I loved it so I thought this one may have been just as good. It was not enjoyable.   Also the valet took FOREVER though it's a tiny parking lot right outside the front door and the booth was freezing despite a heater hanging way too high and no door. Heat rises....I thought most people knew this."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance. VERY good food. Sat outside on the upstairs deck. It was raining and they had the deck covered with the awnings and it was sooooo peaceful. Absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan of what Big Burrito does around Pittsburgh, yet I can't fully recommend Soba to the Asian food enthusiast. While the space and service warrant a 4.5 star rating, one can summarize most dishes as high quality yet forgettable rip-offs.  Not that this designation makes sense or anything at this point, but read on. I'm not going to go into the details of the dishes I ate, as they probably won't be on the menu in the near future. Soba's seasonality is something that makes it stand out, and I appreciate the sourcing of the ingredients. Speaking of the ingredients, everything is a rather high quality, which is to be expected at the price point. My scallops were deliciously meaty and sugar sweet, and my vegetarian dining companion's vegetables all tasted quite fresh. The rhubarb in my desert had a perfectly tangy, subtly sweet flavor. Proteins and veggies stand out.  But the dishes, as a whole, don't warrant the price point. Soba tries to communicate subtlety in flavoring of its food, and it carries this principle of subtlety a bit too far. In fact, the food ends up being on the slightly bland, underseasoned side more often than not. For example, the broth in my entree tasted only vaguely of the soy and ginger promised, and my friend's red curry exhibited anemic spicing. Flaws in execution are similarly prevalent; my noodles and my friend's rice were too mushy. Such flaws didn't detract too heavily from the dining experience, but when I'm paying $70+ (appetizer, dinner, dessert, and drink) for a meal I'm expecting complex flavor and texture contrasts, deft seasoning, and meticulous technique. To that end, Soba fails. The meal was fairly enjoyable, and perhaps I went on an off night, but my sticker shock for good but not great food has yet to subside."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very nice - quiet without feeling like a library, nice lighting, decent and eclectic music mix.  Service was excellent.  The clientele was mixed on Friday night - a couple with a child, two couples double-dating, people just getting drinks, etc.  Onto the food.  The Pacific Rim drink was fruity and not too strong, and also reasonably priced.  The crispy tofu appetizer is awesome.  If I lived closer, I would want it all the time.  The high crispiness level means it was probably deep fried, but it's so yummy I didn't even care. Spicy cucumber raita (amuse bouche) with flatbread was also delicious.  I kind of want a jar of it at home to put on sandwiches or something. As far as entrees, boyfriend had the beef brisket which he said was excellent and very tender.  I had the citrus tofu curry, which was just ok.  If I were a chef, I would have balanced out the very sweet citrus sauce with a little soy sauce or something savory.  The portions were more than big enough. And for dessert, we had the Vietnamese coffee creme brûlée, which was beyond delicious.  I generally enjoyed the meal, but would appreciate maybe one more vegetarian entree to give diners a choice.  Also, a head's up: the adjoining parking lot is small, so if you have a reservation or are meeting people, make sure you allow time to find alternative parking if the lot is full."}
{"text":"Fantastic Interior! Swanky Bar!  Smooth lighting! It's all here! I've loved this place since since setting foot in the door a long time ago. It was always a 5 star experience....but in the last few months somethings different and thus the 3-star status. I'm not sure what it is...whether it's taking exceptionally long to get attention for service (here's a hint...if you get everyone drinks faster, they're probably more likely to have a better experience!), or the quality of food, or not feeling like you got the best value for the price paid when you walk out.... I haven't given up on it here yet - and have high hopes that it's just a bump in the road."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side, but wow is this place great!  Went here with my wife for our anniversary and it quickly has become my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I would go here every week if I could afford it.  My favorite of all the Big Burrito places..."}
{"text":"To start off with, let me tell you that I am big fan of this restaurant and the only reason Im writing this review is to praise it. SOBA has been my favorite restuarant in Pittsburgh that has class, good food, flavourful and each food is served with very good presentation. This restaurant has been the restaurant of choice for any occasion- celebration of job, or birthdays.  Being a vegetarian myself, they really dont have many options for vegetarians. but they ae ever so accommodating to make any pasta customized for vegetarian taste buds.  let me summarize the experiences-  1) the staff is friendly, polite and explain any dish to you if you ask them.  2) lovely lovely ambience. i love the water fountain inside the restuarant. 3) food is flavorful. a tip- the sides listed on the menu are usually small eats and work marvelously as an appetizer for two-three people. make sure you try them. 4) the presentation of the food is really good. matches with the flavor. 5) not a slow service 6) good selection of wines. again the staff explain the best combination for every meal. 7) desert- is top of the world. my personal recommendation- try the chocolate maki. its a desert that is truly creative and deserves five stars. it has chocolate mouse stuffed inside what is similar to a rice roll, instead its a chocoltae crepe. the wasabi is substituted with paste made of pista chocolate sauce becomes the vinegar and of course, ginger is as is. this is by far the best desert i have ever tasted in pittsburgh at any restuarant.   if you are looking for a romantic friday evening, or your first date or just a classy restuarant for celebration then i would highly recommend this. just be aware that the food is a little pricey and can easily run up for more than $100 for just 3 people including drinks."}
{"text":"Went there on a weekday night around 10pm. The restaurant was already closed so we sat in the bar area. The music was nice but the drunk people siting near the window were quite noisy. I wish they could have a separated quieter area.  We ordered some desserts and those are incredible. Very delicious, big portion ( can easily be shared by two people) and inexpensive ($6-8).  One of the two desserts that we ordered was the chocolate maki. It has chocolate maki roll pieces (hard chocolate wrap and chocolate mousse filling), chocolate sauce as the soy sauce and pistachio sauce as wasabi. Very nice presentation and great taste, although it's a little big heavy. You might want to share it with another person.  Another one was the banana split. It has two banana halves covered by crispy sugar coating, three different kinds of ice cream and a banana cake. Very tasty, and each piece has a different contradictory flavor. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good as were the drinks. Didn't get out table until almost 30 min after our reservation. Now, for our waiter... Saw him twice, first to take out order and second well after we were finished to grab the bill. Hopefully we have a different server next time."}
{"text":"This is one of the greatest restaurants I have ever been to and I wish to god I had the kind of wit and vocabulary to accurately reflect the really really REALLY good meal I had here.    As soon as i walked in, I felt really special, which sounds corny and laughably pathetic but I'm not kidding...I felt like one of Angelina Jolie's adopted kids...really special.  The host was a chipper fellow who whisked our coats away and took us to our cozy nook on the second tier in full view of the slate waterfall cascading down the full length of the 3 story restaurant.  I was mesmerized.    Our waitress was a sophisticated, demure lady who catered to our every need and helped us navigate the wonderfully creative menu.  We were given yummy complimentary scallop appetizers over baby veggies.  My sister and I immediately looked at each other and knew this was gonna be goodddddd...  I would spell out every dish and how friggin' awesome it was but I'll post pictures instead...even the one of me crying at the end of the meal.  Be sure to read the captions...  The bathroom was gorgeous showcasing cutting-edge design concepts which had me convinced there was a hidden camera shooting me for the next \"Bold look of Kohler\" commercial (in the non-creepiest way...I do realize I'm talking about hidden cameras in a public bathroom).  I might have scoffed at my little sister for going to school in a sketchy place like Pittsburgh, but quite honestly, I just need to shut up and visit her more often."}
{"text":"I hate to put two stars, but.. I have experienced better. Especially for the price. This was my first visit, and, frankly, it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant.  There were definitely good points. The service was great, and I enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered off the menu. Also, they had a couple of lesser-known cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing. The wine by the glass menu had nice choices, too.  Unfortunately, the food was mixed. I had the pork dumplings for an appetizer. The combination of flavors in the filling, dip and wrapper was very good, but the wrapper was unusually thick and distractingly chewy, even gummy (as in, it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy). The server said they'd just started making their wrappers in-house, and I think they need some work.  I had the chicken ramen soup for a main course. It just wasn't very good. I didn't expect it to be up to Vancouver BC standards (that city seems to have a thing for ramen), but the noodles were a bit tough, and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt. This includes the broth and the chicken. I didn't really want to eat it; I just tried the leftovers, and I don't really want to eat them either.  If the food were at 2/3 to 3/4 of the price I'd give it three stars. As it is, I wish I'd gone somewhere else. Clearly, other people love the place. Maybe I'll give it another chance, if I'm with friends who want to go."}
{"text":"So my wife's birthday was approaching and I was trying to think of somewhere she hasn't been and I immediately thought of Soba as I had previously enjoyed a Yelp event there so I made reservations for dinner.   The decor inside is beautiful. Contemporary modern with an Asian flair. Once we arrived we were immediately seated. A few minutes later Robert, our waiter came with our menus and also told us about the specials of the day.  Since the Yelp event I had studied the menu and knew exactly what to start with. We started off with those amazing Korean Chicken Buns, Korean Barbecue Ribs and Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps. The chicken buns were incredible! The chicken had a crispy skin but was hot and juicy on the inside and went perfectly with that pillowy bun. The Korean Barbecue Ribs were just superb! Tender meat with a nice tangy sauce and the Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps were delicious as well!  For our entrees the birthday girl chose the Spicy Cantonese Beef Noodles which features beef tenderloin, rice noodles, basil, sprouts, garlic, local beans, scallion  and I chose the Korean Fried Chicken which is literally half of a chicken. The chicken was cooked the same way as the chicken in the bao bun was so it was outstanding! Perfectly seasoned with crispy skin on the outside and hot and juicy meat on the inside.  When I made the reservations I let them know that it was my wife's birthday and our waiter Robert let her chose any dessert for free so she chose the Chocolate Pretzel Stack. It features wonton pretzel chips, malted milk chocolate cream, miso caramel and kinako truffle. IT WAS EPIC! One of the best desserts we have ever had!  Robert was very patient with us as we had a lot of questions about the evenings entrees before we finally made a decision. He had a extensive knowledge of the food and was able to figure out what we would and would not like for our main entrees. He took excellent care of us the entire evening and made sure the we were never without a full glass or needed anything.  Soba is now one of our favorite restaurants and we both highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't been yet."}
{"text":"I have always bee a fan of the big burrito restaurants. My boyfriend and i have been there 4 times and each time it has been amazing. the decor is excellent and its dark and even romantic. they also have a hip bar with couches and they open it up during the summer During certain holidays they have the chefs tasting  menu which has 4 courses. My boyfriend got that during their thanksgiving special and he LOVED IT!!!!!   I have gotten the spinach and mushroom dumplings as a starter  a couple of times and they were amazing the pepper dipping sauce was soo delicious. for my entree i got the red curry tofu and the flavors were amazing. it was very filling and all the vegetables blended well. for desert i got the caramel bomb and it was DELISH!!!!  I ve had the vegetarian pad thai on a different occasion and that was pretty amazing too. They dont have too many vegetarian options i kind of wish they did.   They have a great wine and cocktail selection too.  For non vegetarians the chefs tasting options they have every once in a while are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service!  Our waitress was helpful with food and drink suggestions, since it was our first time dining at soba.  I came with my SO, and we ordered three small plates, an entree, and dessert.  We shared everything \"family style,\" and I was happily surprised that the kitchen actually split our shared entree into two separate bowls for us.  By the way, it was the Korean-style miso black cod, which I strongly recommend!  The apps were hit or miss, but one hit was the sea bass satay.  I found it interesting that the ambience varies greatly, depending on where you were seated in the restaurant.  We were in a very dark area upstairs, but I noticed some other parts of the restaurant had better lighting.  Would recommend coming for a nice occasion!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, gourmet class! Loved the scallops with Korean rice noodles. Am hard to please with fusion, but these folks have pulled it off."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat for a special occasion.   I'll break down the atmosphere, service, and food below!   Atmosphere is very intimate with low lighting to set the mood. Tables for 2 are a little close to each other but this seems to be the new trend in restaurants. Sometimes it is hard to not pay attention to neighboring table conversations or glance at what they are eating. Very clean however and the decor gives you a modern asian feel.  Service was awesome. Albert was our server for the evening and helped us with all of our questions. He was extremely versed on all menu items and their descriptions. Our food arrived in steady sync and other staff members came by to constantly fill our waters and clear empty plates.  Now for the good part, the FOOD! They were offering a 4 course tasting menu which we opted to pass on. To start we ordered the Corn and Crab bisque. Excellent semi smoky flavor with plenty of jumbo lump crab and corn to accompany the smooth texture of the soup. We then got the rock shrimp tempura and lobster tacos. The shrimp came out with perfect temperature and crispiness tossed in a spicy dressing. Very similar to the shrimp served at The Bonefish Grill. The Lobster tacos had a nice fresh taste with the crunch of the shell. The avocado cream was seasoned just right and the zest of the lime was delightful. For our main entrees my girlfriend and I both got the Filet with fried brussel sprouts. Filets were cooked perfectly to our liking and the crisp on the sprouts were delicious. Dessert consisted of the Chocolate Maki that I took a picture of an Creme Brûlée. Both exceptional.   Overall, a great experience from start to finish from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. Valet is also nice as it is complimentary and tip is not required, but always good to do so, especially with the weather being so cold!"}
{"text":"For a fusion restaurant, the food is ok. It's nothing to write home about though. Big burrito's offerings are like pottery barn or CB2--attractive on the surface but generally lacking in quality. The portions are Pittsburgh-sized (i.e., large), so be careful you don't order too much food. The tuna is one of the better items on the menu. Lobster maki is not great. Chocolate maki is the right choice for those with a sweet tooth. Service is the best feature of this restaurant. The bartenders are attentive. The clientèle is generally upscale--you can always find a few profs from CMU to chat with at the bar."}
{"text":"Of all the Big Burrito restaurants, Soba is probably my favorite. I absolutely love both the atmosphere and the food. When I got my Big Burrito birthday coupon, I knew Soba was the place I wanted to use it on this year.   Of all the things I've tried, the one thing you must get is the Chilean sea bass satays. These morsels are so light and perfectly seasoned. Even if you don't like fish, still give it a try as they're not at all fishy. I've thoroughly enjoyed everything else I've ordered here so I honestly think you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! we had such a sublime experience here.  Service was wonderful, efficient, not fussy or intrusive.  The food?  Awesome!  We started with the crispy calamari and the crystal dumplings (?) or whatever they were called.  Both were delicious.  John had the bibimbap and I had the duck, which we both agreed was the best duck we'd ever had.  Just perfect.  We're not big on desserts, but it was a special occasion, so we splurged.  John had the terrine and I had the ice cream sandwich, both very nice endings to a fantastic meal.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Soba delivered again! One of the perks of being on the Big Burrito mailing list is the postcard they send every year at your birthday time for a free entree. I like to celebrate my birthday with some good food in the company of friends, so I usually select a restaurant and invite a few folks to join me. Tuesday night eight of us met at Soba for what turned out to be a truly lovely evening.   We had great service from go. The staff is very professional, yet willing to engage. We were seated on the top level, which was quite nice because it was quiet and there were only a few other tables aside from ours.   The roasted beet salad ($10) was a nice start. Golden and red beets were thinly sliced and piled with arugula, cortland apples, a very pretty light pink radish with green skin, cashews, and dressed with ginger vinaigrette. Others around the table enjoyed the chopped salad, tuna tartar, spicy tuna maki, and the calamari. There were no complaints and many a plate circumnavigated the table. Several of the group commented that the calamari were particularly good.  There are currently three veg options on the menu, and it was a hard choice:  * red curry tofu: wild mushrooms, yellow wax beans, yu choy, fried cauliflower, carrots, chickpeas, basil, steamed jasmine rice ($17) * autumn vegetable and rice cake: butternut squash, chanterelles, apples, spinach, fermented black beans, miso butter, pine nuts ($17) * spicy pumpkin and basil noodles: shiitake, baby bok choy, peanuts, fried egg ($17)  I finally chose the noodles with the spicy pumpkin and basil sauce. The dish was pleasantly spicy and I liked the addition of the egg. I would have liked the bok choy to be cut a little smaller and the shitakes cut a little bigger, but these are very small complaints about an otherwise very enjoyable dish.  My mother when with the autumn vegetables and rice cakes, which really weren't \"cakes\" at all, but more like small balls (about the size of a gnocci) made out of rice noodles. It was \"too spicy\" for her, but I really can't tell you what she meant because it is not spicy at all. It had a bit of a smoky rustic flavor and no spiciness whatsoever. All I know is that the rest of her dish is now in my fridge which I will be enjoying later.   Dessert started out as a hard sell to my dining companions, but I had saved room--this was my birthday dinner after all! What's a birthday dinner without \"cake\"!?! I went with the chocolate maki: dark chocolate mousse wrapped in a  chocolate pistachio crepe and sliced to looked like a maki roll. A small pile of pistachio cream sat next to it looking like wasabi and the \"pickled ginger\" was really thing slices of cantaloupe. A small pot of chocolate sauce mimicked soy for dipping. T'was rich and fine, however, being the ginger fiend that I am, I really wished they had used real pickled ginger!  Others shared the chocolate pretzel stack, consisting of wonton 'pretzel' chips, malted milk chocolate cream, miso caramel, and a kinako truffle. My spoon may have found it's way into that pile up and I was impressed. the \"pretzel\" was really tasty and the malted chocolate cream complemented it well. My mother and I both agreed that the miso caramel was amazing, and while mom's concept of \"spicy\" may be questionable, her judgment of things caramel is not. I also heard no complaints about the black & white ice cream sandwich (dark chocolate cookies, white chocolate cheesecake ice cream, peppermint sabayon, pomegranate molasses), though it sounds like too much for me.   Soba has consistently delivered a solid menu and fine service over the years. Once on the cutting edge of Pittsburgh's nascent culinary scene, they're now part of the old vanguard, but there's nothing stale about the place. Adventurous vegetarians and omnivores will all find something to delight the palate, though I can't guarantee your 70 year old mom will fare as well."}
{"text":"Hit up Soba for Valentine's day.  We were late making reservations so I stalked Open Table for an opening all day and finally got an opening.   The ambiance is great, though we were seated next to a patio that's closed for the season, so we had the least romantic spot in the house with views of chairs turned over on tables and a leafy concrete.  We have ordered the rock shrimp tempura before and it was really our reason for heading to Soba on Valentine's Day.  We joked on the way that we should just order 3 plates, but when our dish arrived this night, the batter was browned, the lemons (normally insanely good) were unevenly cooked, chewy and bitter instead of crispy and melt-in-your-mouth.  The shrimp were half the size they'd been the last time we'd ordered and a little chewy as well.  Still worth a try because when they are good, they are crazy good.  We got the shrimp spring rolls but they were dripping with grease and just plain dull and disappointing.  The shrimp was undetectable and the vegetables soggy.  The homemade mustard and duck sauces were delicious but not enough to redeem the dish.  Though we had room for dessert, we only managed to eat one egg roll between the two of us, picked at a second one and took the third home, but it found it's way into the trash.  For half the price, you'll find more satisfaction with some old school egg rolls at your run of the mill Asian eatery.    The fried rice was a nice sized plate and the shrimp in this dish were cooked beautifully.  The bok choy was a great addition, but the plate did cry out a bit for a drizzle of sauce of some kind.  It was a little bit of a disappointing visit, but we'll probably give it a try again sometime."}
{"text":"I had dinner and drinks with a group of 7 just before Thanksgiving.  Soba was one of the few places in the area that was able to accomodate a Friday night reservation for that many people in a short time, so that was great.  The drinks are good, and the wine list is decent.  We were there at Happy Hour time, but you have to go to the bar yourself for the Happy Hour offerings and prices, which was a little annoying but not a big deal.  However, my husband ordered the Manhattan off of the Happy Hour menu, but the bartender made him the regular one, which was twice the price, even though he pointed to the HH one.  Not sure where the miscommunication was there, but then the bartender did not offer to remake or take back the incorrect drink.  Again, not a huge issue, just a little grievance.  Overall the food was just ok, I did not find it specatcular to warrant 5 stars.  Casbah is still our go-to restaurant in the Big Burrito group, but Soba is nice for a change."}
{"text":"Last night my husband, two friends of ours and myself had dinner at Soba.  Well attempted too...  While waiting for our food,  the power went out  and stayed out.  After the initial \"we thank you for your patience \"walk around we did not see our server or host until we flagged someone down to get our check.  The restaurant did not offer any of us complimentary drinks or even ask how we were doing.  We left after sitting in the dark for 40 minutes and got tacos somewhere else.  The appetizers we had were great, but not worth sitting in the dark."}
{"text":"I've wanted to dine at Soba for as long as I can remember, and I finally had the perfect opportunity to celebrate a girlfriend's birthday there!   I arrived a little before she did and checked in for the evening! I was greeted by the kindest hostess who offered to check my coat (bonus!) and gave me the option to wait in the lounge or right there in the receiving area. Both were elegant and beautiful! Once my friend arrived, we were quickly seated. I would definitely recommend making a reservation because it seemed that everyone who came in had and the place was packed by 6pm!   We started with celebratory cocktails, of course! She enjoyed the khalessi while I enjoyed the Asian plum sangria. I really loved my drink and she enjoyed hers as well. Mine was sweet while hers had notes of orange bitters.   We shared the rock shrimp tempura as an appetizer and that was probably my favorite thing of the night! Crispy, flavorful - it had it all. Then we also shared an order of the pad Thai, a lobster taco, as well as the spicy tuna roll. Both of these were amazing as well! The pad Thai features chicken, shrimp, and tofu! The sushi was just excellent. By the time we had finished sharing all of these things, I was stuffed. Portions are not skimpy! BUT, It was a birthday, so dessert was in order! We ordered the chocolate pretzel stack and it was to die for! A rich, creamy mousse with a crunchy pretzel crust and a caramel drizzle. We could barely finish half of it because it was so rich!   Protip: if it's a birthday, sign up for emails from the big burrito company and you can get a coupon to soba for a complimentary entree up to $30! (Most entrees on their menu are not more than that)   We were fortunate enough to be able to walk there, but they do offer valet parking if you don't want to attempt driving to Ellsworth.   There are still several menu items I want to sample and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I like the crispy tofu here.  Its in a great location and the food is pretty good.  Great for mixing up the chicken wings and pizza lifestyle of shadyside.  Never had dessert.  Staff is always nice."}
{"text":"So the majority of my food was good here, appetizer (King Edward Mussels), dessert (sorbet) but the main course I ordered: soba noodle was horrible. It was way to salty which overwhelmed all other flavours.  Normally I would give a place a second chance, but this is soba we are talking about the namesake of the restaurant.  For this price, I would expect excellent food and great atmosphere which this place has failed to deliver."}
{"text":"Dined at Soba a few weeks ago for date night and it most definitely did not disappoint. It was a very nice, relaxed atmosphere. Even better being a beautiful evening with the front opened up! The server was very knowledgeable and attentive and the food was amazing! We will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Ambience was beautiful but main dishes were not as good as appetizers. Rice was incredibly salty, and the duck was \"recommended\" to be cooked medium rare, however it was terribly rubbery and fatty. The sauce was good though. It took 45 minutes for us to get our check.   Go for drinks, not for meal"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,service and food! Had the mushroom pad Thai, rock shrimp tempura and tuna tartare!! The am going back for the tartare alone!! Perfect date night with my hubby"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday a few weeks ago and it was amazing.  We started with happy hour drinks in the lounge. They have a number of $6 cocktails. It's a really nice space. We sat at the bar, but the lounge has a lot of bench/couch type seating and small tables. It's not a huge space, but there's definitely enough room. We were there on a Friday around 6:30 and it wasn't too crowded.   For our dinner reservations, we were seated upstairs and thought the decor was really nice. It was a little dark, but that was okay. We could read the menu just fine and it made things feel cozy. I also liked that it wasn't too loud.  Dinner was amazing. We split 3 appetizers and an entree. This was some of the best calamari I've ever had and we loved the Korean fried chicken bao buns. The chicken was flavorful and really crispy. I'd really want to get those again or try the pork belly ones. We had tried the filet satays at a Yelp event, so decided to go with the sea bass satay and it was awesome. Really juicy and flavorful. The glaze was good too, but not too sweet. We got the miso black cod as an entree. I loved that this was just a little bit spicy and the cod went so well with the barbeque pork. The kitchen even split the entree in half for us, which made things so much easier. It was so nice of the waitress to offer.  I think this was one of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh. I really want to make it back. It was cozy and would work well for a romantic, casual meal out, or the lounge is great for a fun happy hour with friends."}
{"text":"I've been to Soba twice and it was my first real experience with \"upscale\" dining.  The inside is great, I was especially fond of the two story waterfall against one wall. The seats were comfortable and the pace of the service let you know that you could stick around a while and enjoy yourself.  The food isn't as Asian as I expected it but still delicious. I went with the filet mignon and it melted in my mouth like butter. The sprouts on top gave it a nice, fresh crunch.  The service was spectacular, as it should be for this type of establishment. My only real complaint is that after having been to Kaya and Eleven, I feel Soba could diversify their menu a bit. A few of their dishes can be found on its brother's menus and I don't think they're quite capturing Eastern food.  Either way, it's delicious."}
{"text":"Every year my husband and I alternate Big Burrito Restaurants where we use our birthday coupon. None ever disappoint. We had never tried Soba and boy were we glad we did. The whole experience was amazing.  We started out with both types of sangria. The white was good until you tasted the red, which was delicious. We loved it.  Our appetizer was the filet satay. Wow! It was perfectly cooked & seasoned. The meat was so tender and melted in our mouths. We hated for it to end.  I had the Pad Thai and I normally love Pad Thai. Everyone raved about it, but unfortunately I don't think it lived up to the hype. I did not find it flavorful at all. I also felt they could have made it a lesser portion & charged less.  My husband had the Korean fried chicken & loved it. I thought it was moist & delicious with perfect breading. The only thing I didn't like on the plate was a tiny bit of potato that looked like a sweet potato, but tasted like a bland potato.  We finished the night off with the pretzel stack. A friend of ours loved it & I did not care for the taste at all.  The decor and ambiance in the dinning room was great. The lounge was beautiful and looked like a fun place to have cocktails with friends. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to Soba to celebrate my sons birthday. Quality of food was not at all what was expected for the price. We have eaten there several times in the past but not sure that we will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. I did not like my tuna entree, despite it being somewhere around $35.   I do enjoy their cocktails, and like to come to the bar for happy hour."}
{"text":"I eat at Soba with my parents almost every time they come to town. I'm just out of grad school and not exactly in a high paying field, so I can't afford to come here on my own. I've had a great experience every time except for the last one, when I came here with my boyfriend.   I've had the Thakkali curry, the chicken ramen, and the filet and they've all been wonderful. My boyfriend is horrified that I enjoyed the Thakkali curry so much because it's a vegetarian dish and he loves meat, but it really is tasty, especially the roti. I've had a bunch of the appetizers too, and my favorite is the Thai lettuce wraps.   The last time I ate at Soba, I had a less than good experience. Maybe I went into the dinner in a lesser mood than usual because I wasn't excited to see my parents (they weren't in town) and it was raining, but I just had a generally bad experience. I ordered the basil noodles and they were horrible. I've written in many of my other reviews that I do not like sweet noodles, and these tasted like candy. They were gross. And sloppy. And saucy. So I had about 2 bites and went home hungry.   I don't know if Soba directly employs its valet parking attendants or whether they contract out, but I also have a bone to pick with them. My boyfriend arrived separately in his fancy Audi and they parked his car right out front. I showed up in my Hyundai and they parked it over the river and through the woods. I joked to my boyfriend that they parked mine in another zip code because it's \"shabby\" and not fancy like his, and the parking attendant entered the conversation and told me yeah, that's true. They park the \"lesser\" cars in another lot because they're afraid of damaging the nicer cars. I get it. My car isn't a luxury car, so they are less afraid of having to pay to fix it if it gets dinged up, but is he really telling me that? I couldn't believe it."}
{"text":"I need to return to Soba for entrees; this review is for pretty much everything else on the menu--small plates, drinks, and dessert. Three of us went through four small plates slowly, and with the apt guidance of our patient and chipper waiter. It was nice not to be rushed, even though we intended to graze through the meal. The tuna tartare was conventional, but tasty, and the lobster maki's lobster was hard to taste or even find. However, the short rib buns--wow. Short ribs are everywhere lately--thanks, Top Chef--but I'd eat these every day, as their richness and warmth was balanced brightly by pickled cucumber and cilantro. We washed these plates down with cocktails: I'd highly recommend mine, which had amaretto, sake, and coconut milk and tasted like a cool, smooth cookie. We then split two desserts with dessert wine and sherry to match. The chocolate maki had us licking our fingers.  I'm not totally sold on the originality of the menu, but it sure tasted good. Next up: Casbah!"}
{"text":"Intimate, sleek, and dark atmosphere. The staff is very professional and attentive.   The food is well prepared, visually appealing, and filling. I appreciate the generous portion sizes here. Everything at this restaurant exceeded my expectations.   Patrons, for the most part, were well dressed when I dined there on a weekend evening. Overall, this is a solid recommendation for a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"My mom really wanted to go here on a causal night and I was skeptical because it felt like more of a \"special night\" place....but I am a total convert. I LOVE it here!   We sat at the bar, so there was a more laid back feel. They had a good selection of beers on tap. I love beer so it was nice to have some craft / American options at an ethnic food restaurant.   We shared the crispy tofu, chicken spring rolls, pork lettuce and edamame hummus. There was SO MUCH FOOD! This was WAY more than enough for both of us and I ended up taking everything but the spring rolls home (because we finished those!). Everything tasted so good. The pork lettuce wraps were a tiny bit heavy on the peanuts, but that is the worst criticism I can come up with.   Food = awesome, atmosphere = awesome, beer choices = awesome. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A very elegant restaurant. Perfect for a special night.  The entrees on Soba's menu are not cheap. I personally think that the items on their share and appetizer menu (which are significantly cheaper than the entrees) also taste better. I prefer ordering a few of these items and sharing them with friends.  I'm a huge fan of tofu, and Soba makes their Crispy Tofu extremely well. I have ordered the spicy tuna roll and double salmon roll. While the rolls do taste good, I don't think they were really worth the price. I would've enjoyed an order of another appetizer instead.  Soba has an eclectic variety of Asian inspired dishes, and I will be returning soon to try different items on its menu.  --  taste / 4 aesthetics / 5 vibe / 5 service / 4 price for quality / 3 OVERALL / 4.2"}
{"text":"Dude.  Pittsburgh.  Who knew you had such a refined and sexy dining scene???  Well, your good citizens, that's who.  Which is how husband and I were referred to Point Brugge, Salt of the Earth, and lastly Soba Lounge, thanks to the brilliant hostess at our B&B who told us Soba was her favorite spot within walking distance.  I don't usually dine without Yelping these days, but I am *so* glad we recklessly heeded her advice.  Our meal at Soba was one of the finest, most delicious, and wholly satisfying that I can recall (joining Salt of the Earth, no less, in that prestigious category...).  The subtle lighting and modern décor of the joint is coolly lovely, setting the mood right away for a relaxed dining experience.  Attentive, professional service is provided by servers who explain that most of the produce used in Soba's dishes is locally sourced and are happy to make recommendations.  Husband and I started out with an Asparagus Maki Roll appetizer, with tempura asparagus, tamago, roasted local shiitakes, scallion, and a spicy lemon ponzu.  The soft, sticky rice didn't overwhelm the crunchy asparagus, earthy 'shroom, and slightly-sweet tamago; the ponzu dip was a pleasantly sour foil.  We also had an order of Thai-inspired Blue Bay Mussels with crispy soba and aioli, which were *fab-u-lous.*  I eat a lot of mussels, but these were some of the most enjoyable I've ever had.  For entrées, husband and I split the Soba Noodle Scallops -- which arrived at the table with root spinach, cuttlefish, wild mushroom, and fresh wasabi -- and the Seared Tuna -- with a sesame crust, cucumber-red-onion salad, kimchee, ginger fried rice, and peanuts.  Both dishes were out of this world.  Husband I had trouble cutting ourselves off at half and switching plates, but were both rewarded tenfold for doing so.  The scallops had a perfect sear, the soba was fat and chewy, the ponzu wasabi broth was soul-warming.  And the tuna was seared expertly, still gorgeously garnet and cool in the middle, complemented by a crunchy, nutty sesame crust and that flavorful rice.  I don't think either of us wanted that meal to end.  And all things considered, husband and I thought the bill at the end of the night was ridiculously reasonable.  Soba FTW.  Pittsburgh, I have a crush on you.  Your perfectly-priced fine-dining scene makes me want to pull up stakes and move in with you."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Soba more than I did! I have heard a lot of things about this restaurant but never had the chance to try it until I had some visitors from out of a town and another friend made reservations here for dinner.   There was a group of 6 of us who went out to dinner, our reservations were around 9:30 on a Saturday night. This is my friend's favorite restaurant who made the reservations- so I was looking forward to trying some new cuisine! When we arrived to the restaurant, the hostess informed us that our table wasn't ready yet so we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before we were seated. This was fine since we were able to grab some drinks at the bar while we waited. The inside of Soba is very dark and \"swanky\"... I did feel a little underdressed while being inside. It seems like a place that people were coming to celebrate special occasions... but there was also a small mix of people (including myself) who were dressed more casual.   After we were seated, we were all set on drinks. Everyone had ordered different drinks ranging from beers to martinis. I stuck with vodka and water for my not so fancy cocktail. For a starter, we ordered the rock shrimp tempura small plate. This shrimp was pretty good and was generous in size- there was more than enough for all of us to enjoy! For my meal, I ordered the spicy pork lettuce wraps off the small plate menu. This was very different from anything that I have ever had! The pork/rice mixture was delicious and had the right amount of spice. Again, this was a very generous serving for being considered a \"small plate\". Chris ordered the pad thai, which came with chicken, shrimp, and tofu. It seemed a little heavy on the tofu- which I'm sure next time he could ask for more chicken/shrimp. The pad thai was just OK- doesn't compare to others I have had in Pgh. Soba was a nice experience, but I think I'll try out some new places before returning."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome!!!!!!!!!i went for dinner last night and everything tasted amazing. The atmosphere is great and the drinks are a reasonable price. I highly recommend this place for dinner."}
{"text":"I used to love soba. The past few months drinks, service and food have dropped to the point where I won't return."}
{"text":"I love Soba. I started off with their signature dirty martini.  They make it with this fancy pickle juice and Hendricks gin.  Lucky for Soba I moved to solid foods after two of those on an empty stomach.    I slurred my dinner order of the pork belly, crispy tofu, lobster maki rolls, and Thai corn chowder-all fantastic. The pork belly was topped with brown sugar crumble and cooked with honey. It was amazing.  For dessert I had the pumpkin ice cream sandwiches.  I washed all of that down with two Ketel One and sodas and stumbled out of the restaurant fat and happy.    Sadly, our car was broken into in the parking lot and my friend's laptop was stolen and his window broken.  I told the bartender just in case the employees park there as well.  He was genuinely sympathetic but not entirely surprised.  Based on what the police officer said, it was the second one tonight.  She also said there is at least one of these a day in that lot or around the restaurant on the street. I think Soba may need to invest in a part time parking lot attendant to protect their customers."}
{"text":"Had I went with more people, I would have loved to have ordered more small plates to share. However, I ventured to Shadyside alone. As an appetizer, I ordered the kim chi pancake. The sauce is what makes the dish. Without the tangy soy sauce, the kim chi, which has bay scallops and shrimp, the pancake tasted lackluster. Definitely to be combined with kim chi and the bean sprouts sides as well.   As my main entree I ordered the miso cod. FABULOUS. By far the best cod I've ever had. The flavors were so rich and surprising with every bite. Atop the cod was a zesty lemony topping, while the miso sauce was unbelievable with a spicy kick. The cod was perfectly tender and just melted in the mouth. While the BBQ pork was less tender, I appreciated that it was lean meat. Along with the pine nuts and the rice cake medallions, each bite was a sensory eruption. Sizeable portion.  For dessert I ordererd the banana split with bruleed banana, banana cake, chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce, lychee sorbet (substitute for sesame, on the side), and condensed milk. Super decadent, but terrfic.   Service was impeccable. Cool atmosphere in an up-and-coming neighborhood. Definitely an interesting Pan-Asian repertoire."}
{"text":"My favorite Burrito group restaurant. My husband and I love the shrimp tempura. Additionally, we love their desserts. Drinks were well made. Overall, great food and great service."}
{"text":"Every year for my birthday I always get a big burrito bday coupon to use at one of their restaurants - eleven, casbah, soba are usually the 3 I pick from.  This year was soba's turn.  First, I love and might be addicted to the rock shrimp tempura appetizer - so light and crunchy and delicious - you have to try!   High hopes for the Chilean sea bass  satays but I didn't care for it too much.  Maybe because I love Chilean sea bass so much - it's so buttery and tender without having to do anything to it - it felt like such a crime to sauce up such a beautiful tasting fish - I mean they could've swapped it with cod and it would've tasted the same.  They had a Korean fried chicken bahn mi (not on menu but should get if available) that was super tasty.    For dinner our table got the dolsot bi bim bap x2 (yum!), tandoori grilled salmon (yum!), and a Long Island duck (yum!).   Everyone gave it a thumbs up!    And since it was my bday we had to get dessert and wowza - soba can DO dessert!  We got 2 and shared and the combo of both together we ate every little bit- please get the chocolate pretzel stack and the soba banana split.  So yum  Oh check out the lounge - there was a dj and it was a great vibe - they also have drink specials after 10 pm - I'm going to try the khaleesi next time"}
{"text":"I love the ambience here, and the fact that it is so close to my house is a definite plus! Although, it is dangerous to be so close to one of my favorite spots in the city. The tuna is my absolute favorite entree, hands down. The Korean barbecue sauce on the tuna has the perfect amount of acid and heat, and the sesame crust adds just the right amount of crunch for texture. It is served with ginger fried rice and kimchi, and both are always delicious.  To start, try the lobster maki and the Korean BBQ ribs. The octopus starter is also fantastic if you are feeling adventurous. I am obsessed with the chopped salad. I could eat this daily-no joke. The combination of daikon and mango with mint and cashews is absolutely perfect. I absolutely love love love this salad.  If you venture upstairs to Umi in your future eating adventures, rest assured that Umi's dessert menu features all Soba desserts. They always have a seasonal shortcake-my favorite is the plum. And the chocolate pretzel stack is pretty spectacular, despite the fact that I'm not really a chocolate person.   The only person in my party who wasn't blown away by their food the last time I was here ordered the vegetarian curry option. It was just okay due to its lack of complexity and flavor. But, unless you are a vegetarian, you really can't go wrong with any of the other entrees. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of visiting this establishment two times over the last several months.  The first time was for a fancy-pants dinner in which the upstairs portion of the restaurant was reserved and the guests were privileged enough to indulge in unlimited drinks and a very elaborate 5 course meal.  Soba is very much \"Asian-Fusion\" in its cuisine, and it pulls it off quite well.  As a vegetarian, there are plenty of options for me to choose from.  Some of the dishes that stand out to me include the tofu appetizer and the vegetable curry entree.  The second time I visited here, I sat by the bar, which is dimly lit, relatively quiet, but gives off this cool sort of vibe.  I love it.  We had a great time.  Service was fantastic.   My critiques would be 1.) a tad bit pricier than what I would like to pay and 2.) could up the ante on the spice level just a tad.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this place.  I think you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Great Asian fusion restaurant. My wife and I did the dim sum menu as we love tapas style. We really enjoyed the rock shrimp, calamari and dumplings. They also have great deserts. The atmosphere is really trendy and modern, yet romantic. Our server, Hallee , was phenomenal and really took great care of us. They also have complimentary valet which is really nice in shadyside to not have to look for parking. Highly recommend this place for a nice dinner out!"}
{"text":"Kudos to Rachel C. and Yelp for having an Elite event SO GOOD that it brought me back to Soba almost immediately. I joined the fabulous Jonathan D. for a birthday dinner last night. At my suggestion, he ordered the Korean Fried Chicken (the Yelp sample was sooo good, I had to see what the entrée was like). At the recommendation of our fabulous server Albert, I tried the Pad Thai.  I wouldn't usually order Pad Thai outside of the food truck in the Strip, but he assured me that it was above and beyond the regular Pad Thai...and he was RIGHT. This delicious monstrosity is sure to feed me for days. It includes tofu, shrimp, chicken and I swear 4 lbs of noodles.  It's definitely the best Pad Thai I've ever had. Throw in excellent server and a killer ambiance, and you've got one of Pittsburgh's greatest restaurants. I hope to see a few more entrée selections in the future, but other than that, it's perfection!"}
{"text":"Like the other Big Burrito group restaurants, this restaurant features excellent food. Sat at the bar and enjoyed wine, a seafood dinner, and dessert. Fairly fancy although you can get away with wearing jeans."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic.  Loved the salmon and the portion size was perfect.  The service was ok, but felt a bit rushed.  Loved the art work on the walls."}
{"text":"Soba Lounge appears to be the only sign of life in Shadyside.  Moderately trendy 20-40 something year old crowd makes the scene, and seem only too happy to make room for you.  Popped in here only for a nightcap after our lousy Taco Bellesque dinner at the Shady Grove and it was the highlight of the evening.  I've been coming here off and on for years, and the espresso martini is my favorite choice, at only $8 per glass!  Comprehensive beverage menu featuring some excellent wines as well as the darling cans of Sofia champagne.  As a matter of fact, this is the only bar that I have seen offer these besides Coppola's restaurant in North Beach.  if you don't know what they are, it's the grown up girl's take on those Minute Maid drink boxes that your mama packed in your lunch, and definitely a girly drink, but a bit pricy at $11 per can.  Next time I return, I plan to dine here and I can see Soba Lounge being my \"Bar away from SF Bars.\""}
{"text":"Awesome service, food very good, but a tad salty for my taste. Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"I been to Soba a few times and I love the food.  The appetizers are particularly wonderful, so this last time I ordered 3 appetizers, then split an entree.  Yeah, that works.  The mussels are very flavorful: Blue Bay mussels, Thai sausage, basil, and Szechuan peppercorn.  I can also recommend the Filet Mignon, which is prepared with chili garlic mashed potatoes, wild mushrooms, garlic soy,  and pea shoots.  Delicious.  I think the service could tighten up a bit, and I wish the Hostess would be a little more welcoming, but on the whole, the service was good."}
{"text":"After hearing so  much about Soba over the years, I knew it had to be my February destination for my New Year's Resolution: one Pittsburgh restaurant each month that I've never been to!   My 3 girlfriends and I made a reservation for shortly after they opened for the evening, so the space was nice and quiet for the majority of our dining experience.  I ordered a glass of chardonnay ($10) to start, and the four of us decided to split the crispy tofu appetizer ($10).  The appetizer portion was perfect for the four of us to snack on and could easily be made into your meal or hearty shareable plate for two.  For my main course, I ordered a bowl of the Thai corn chowder ($8) and the double tuna fat roll ($14).  There were so many delicious entrees to choose from, but I had to remind myself that my eyes are always bigger than my stomach, and settled on the soup and roll - I will definitely be back again to try one of their entrees:  the Long Island duck & seared rare tuna dishes sounded phenomenal.  Our first round of dishes was served shortly after we finished the crispy tofu:  my Thai corn chowder was excellent - perfect consistency, temperature and flavor.  One complaint is that the menu description for the chowder touts jumbo lump crab meat and I had one measly piece, which was rather disappointing.  The other girls in my party had a couple orders of steamed dumplings, which looked good and again were large enough of a portion to make into a meal.  Our waiter was extremely attentive, checking on us regularly and making sure our water glasses remained filled.  This is such a subtle task, but for as much water as I gulp down at each meal I greatly appreciate when waiters and waitresses keep my glass full.  It was a bit of a wait for our maki rolls which surprised me a bit, seeing as (I would assume) they take less time to prepare than other entree-style dishes.  About 15 minutes after our first course was cleared, our rolls were served.  I'm not sure if there was an error in submitting our order to the kitchen, but both courses that were brought out were served to the wrong person at our table. Perhaps the breakdown came when a different waiter served our food than the waiter that took our order. Obviously the fix is as easy as exchanging a couple of plates across the table, but it's something that could most definitely be avoided.  Regardless of the musical plates that we played, the rolls were delicious and I soon hit a sushi wall... they say you're never to leave a soldier behind, but I had to leave one lone, tasty piece of the double tuna fat roll on the plate by itself.   I had just enough to eat at that point and was mentally high-fiving myself for not ordering an entire entree, half of which would've likely ended up in a doggy bag.  Overall, I am pleased with my experience at Soba and will most definitely be back.  The interior is intimate and dimly lit so it would be a perfect date night spot or, as I did, a girls night out.  There really doesn't seem to be a bad item on the menu. On this particular visit, they were even offering a special prix fixe menu in celebration of the Chinese New Year.  It looked tempting but again, my eyes are always bigger than my stomach and I had to politely decline the opportunity."}
{"text":"We first visited Soba last year and didn't like it despite all the rave (what's wrong with us, right?). We gave it another try this week since we didn't feel like spending our Big Burrito birthday coupon anywhere else.. and my, it is an entirely different experience!  What we ordered this time: Chilean sea bass satays, Crispy calamari, Miso black cod and Roasted chicken ramen. The seafood orders were definitely the highlights. The glaze on the see bass satay brought out all the flavors and the fish was so fluffy! We didn't realize rice cakes accompanied the miso black cod entree even though it said so on the menu, and it was a really nice surprise. Nothing to take home about the roasted chicken ramen though: both the chicken and noodles were too tough.  What we ordered last time: Seared rare tuna (which was alright but bland) and Roasted duck (overcooked).  John served us this time and he had wonderful recommendations. Thank you for making our second visit so enjoyable! We are already planning on returning with guests in the future."}
{"text":"We made an 8:30 reservation at 8:15, and were seated as soon as we arrived. We asked to be seated in the lounge/bar area and they did it without a problem.  Cocktails: nicely done, stiff but not too strong. Not memorable, but not disappointing.   Food: incredible!! Absolutely get the calamari; the mint cilantro combination feels like flavor bursts in your mouth. The Korean BBQ ribs were so tender and fell right off the bone. The tuna tartare is nothing special, but still pretty tasty. The lettuce pork appetizer dish was also incredible. They were also really accommodating of allergies, which is always appreciated.   Service: the hostesses were very polite, but the wait staff was really slow. I'm guessing they need more in the area."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Soba with the girlfriend and two friends.  It was a disappointment from top to bottom as we were excited for a very good asian infused dinner but instead experienced an average at best night out.    At first we were greeted instantly by our server and things started off fine.  However once we placed our drinks it took the staff, I kid you not 25 minutes to make and bring 4 drinks. They would have never been brought if the manager didnt approach the table and ask if everything was ok.  After he finally brought them with the time in mind he did comp our round which was a nice gesture.  The appetizers, which mind you were brought out BEFORE the drinks, without any staff paying attention that fact.  Apps were the best part of the meal.  Korean BBQ Ribs, were dry and really needed the extra bbq sauce to make the rib succulent and still the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. The Rock Shrimp was excellent, very light batter, fantastic lightly spicy sauce and spiced well. same shrimp as Umi.  The Softshell crab was pretty good, the heirloom tomatoes and avocado added a nice touch and the crab was prepared perfectly, soft and a good crisp crunch.   What really hurt this experience were the entrees. I had ordered the Double Cut Pork Chop and ordered it cooked t o the chefs suggestion in preparation when it came out, it was a tough pork chop, noticeable without even cutting into it.  I dealt with it and continued to eat it but overall a tough and dry dish.  The accompaniments such as snap peas, lotus root and mushrooms just seemed very thrown together, and didnt add anything to the taste of the dish, did not mesh well. My friend ordered the Roasted Chicken which was a variation of a chicken ramen soup.  For $22 a ramen entree should be out of this world and it was far from that, and it was work to get the dish into ready condition to be consumed. The girls ordered shareable sushi offerings and found them to be just ok nothing greater than they have had at good sushi restaurants.    The service was lacking all around our meal.  Apparently it was \"Jam on Walnut St Festival\" which meant that many checked out the soba bar for drinks.  However when I went to the restroom and passed by it looked like a normal bar scene to me.  Not only did our beverages take 25 minutes to arrive.  The waiter never checked up on us after app or entree until we were obviously ready for the table to cleared and when I was served my pork chop I still was left with a butterknife to cut this tough piece of meat.  Had to ask server for a steak knife, which was clearly meant to be served with this dish.  When the girls got their shareable entrees the dumpings they ordered were replaced by shittake mushroom dumplings when they ordered shrimp.    The ambience of the restaurant is nice but some of our party had trouble seeing as it is extremely dim all around making it tough to read and even see your dish.  There was a lot of cell phones out at tables around us for flash light usage.  I wouldn't return to Soba it just does not offer enough for me to justify the cost and it looks like right now they are having trouble serving dinner on a saturday night."}
{"text":"This is place is good. I frequented here with a friend of mine who lived right near them so it was convenient. I wish I had places this solid near me. Favorites : crispy tofu ,  pumpkin curry when in season or any of their Thai dishes, and their Thai mule cocktail.   Ambience is this swanky chic lounge in the back first come first serve that is a beautiful area to kick back before going out, as we always did. Reminds me of the Delano hotel bar in Miami. Bartenders are great. Lounge Service can be hit or miss if it's busy. Dining section, service is always great!   Overall, great atmosphere, good food, and awesome cocktails. Can't go wrong. Perfect for dates or starting out the night."}
{"text":"MMM my hubby and I went there for the first time tonight.  Its probably our new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.    After they took our coats, we were seated on the 2nd teir looking across to the waterfall wall... We were there a lil early for dinner (530ish) So we were theonly ones upstairs, it was really nice... and quiet.  Service was wonderful and relaxed.   First, ordered the corn chowder, and the lobster maki for starters. I'm VERY picky about sushi, hubby loves it, and he can rarely get me to eat it.  It was delcious!!  I'm actually craving more now that I'm thinking about it.    The corn chowder was also very tastey... but after 3 or 4 bites you're mouth needs some time to cool down!! Its got some kick, but a good kick :)  Ohh, I almost forgot the complimentary appetizer that the chef sent out... I wasn't really listening to her explain it, but it was some sort of delcious hummus on a truffle infused chip... AMAZING.  They should put iton the menu :)    For entrees, I got the pad thai and hubby got the filet.  Both were really good, the filet especially.  Probably one of the best steaks I've had.  Hubby gobbled down the whole thing...  but i had to box up most of my pad thai... I think the sushi and the corn chowder filled me up... ANDi wanted to save room for a dessert.  OMG.  We shared the frozen cashew terrine.  Orgasmic.    This will be our new regular place, i think :)"}
{"text":"It's beautiful and dark inside, each corner has something interesting to look at or a different texture.  It's a lot to take in before you even open the menu.  We started with drinks (old fashioned cider for me - a little cider wouldn't have killed you on this - I didn't order a cup of bourbon over ice) and a beer for the husband.  I also tried a sangria, but it was more kool-aid than wine.   Onto the food!  We started with three things - tuna maki, rock shrimp tempura the crab-corn chowder.  Each was absolutely amazing!  The tuna was super flavorful, the rock shrimp was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the chowder.  Wow.  I really want to go back and just bathe in the chowder.  It was spicy and crabby and super thick.  More like a corn milkshake.  Delish!  I had the seafood hot pot and J had the pad thai.  The pad thai was perfection.  My hot pot left me a little confused.  It sounded like soup, but came out in a weird bowl with like a thick mixture on the bottom not resembling soup broth.  The mussels were good, but small.  The scallops were amazing.  The fish cake was also very flavorful and not at all fishy, like I had had in prior fish cakes.  It wasn't that any distinct part wasn't good, it just wasn't what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Special place.  I had bibimbap and it was tasty.  Definite cool ambiance.  The place has swagger.  Lots of good grub on the menu to keep you coming back."}
{"text":"We love it here. Great drinks, great food. Servers are great. We have a 1 year old and come for happy hour and they treat her with as much respect as everyone else"}
{"text":"The Vietnamese short rib was amazing, the hotteok will change your life.  Excellent atmosphere and experience all around.  Get a desert!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer for so many years I can't even tell you how many.  But lately, I notice a slight drop in quality in the food (subtle changes like the chips that accompany the tartare).  And I do not at all like that there are ever fewer small plates to choose from, rather being forced to get a plate to \"share\" when we dont' want to share.   The service has dropped a bit too.  The servers used to be so professional that it felt like NY.  Still better than most places but I am disappointed that Soba has not been able to maintain the level of quality that brought me there in the first place.  It may just be that now that there are so many other good new restaurants, there are just not enough quality servers to staff them all. The menu has become too predictable and boring.  Kind of flat.  Like the kitchen is no longer inspired.  It feels like the energy has gone into building the addition rather than the food and service. I am writing not to complain but rather to encourage everyone to perk up and go back to the lovely choices, presentations and service that brought you to be voted one of the city's best.  As you know, if you don't constantly maintain your standards in this business, you'll sink into oblivion.  And i'd hate to see that happen!"}
{"text":"Went to experience their summer Vietnamese fixed four-course meal. The offerings were delicious, well presented, and comprised an excellent menu.  Two concerns:  first the speed of serving each course was too fast.  As soon as we finished the appetizers, the second course was served.  The only well timed service was the final item, dessert.  Second, the main entree had some improperly prepared pho noodles....under cooked and quite hard and clumpy....however, upon request an additional serving of properly prepared pho was provided.  Aside from those issues...the four course meal was excellent."}
{"text":"First, it's a beautiful space. It's the kind of place that would be good for a nicer date. It's also the kind of place where they offered to take our coats at the door.  I tried two cocktails. The Hattori Hanzo was pretty good. I like cocktails that are sweet, but where you can still taste the alcohol. I also had the Asian Plum Sangria, which tasted like juice, so if you don't like to get that hint of alcohol in your cocktail, that'd be my recommendation. Sips of my friends' Cucumber Collins and Thai Mule proved that they can make decent cocktails at Soba. I was expecting something a little more creative tasting at a place like Soba, but I guess I can't complain about what they did have.   Food-wise, we ordered the shiitake dumplings and bao buns as appetizers. The dumplings were a bit doughy. However, the bao buns with fried chicken (instead of the typical pork belly) were delicious! I wanted more. I got the Seared Rare Tuna. It came with rice, kimchi, cucumbers and onions, and a BBQ peanut sauce. I'm glad they put the sauce on the side because it was a bit overpowering. The tuna was one large chunk. I think they should have served it as two pieces and drizzled the sauce on top, but overall, it tasted nice and it was filling. I tried my friend's Miso Black Cod and it was scrumptious, like melt in your mouth delicious. The Long Island Duck was also pretty good. For dessert we shared (as you can tell, we love sharing) the Tahitian Vanilla Creme Brûlée and the Frozen Cashew Terrine. Both were really great.   One thing I'd suggest would be for them to be informed as to where the fish is sourced from. I wanted to know where the tuna was from, but our server didn't know. Overall though, the service was good."}
{"text":"I love coming to Soba -- everything I have ever had here has been wonderful, from happy hour cocktails and appetizers to full course meals. I can never pass up the crispy tofu (which is also great at Mad Mex) -- it's the perfect balance of sweet and tart. For dinner, I realize the menu changes all the time, but if you ever come across it, I highly recommend the butternut squash soup as a starter. It's delicious! It's filling on its own (almost), but naturally I followed it with one of the noodle bowls with chicken, which was just spicy enough with flavorful chicken and vegetables.  The curry dishes are excellent, too. Soba service has always been friendly and attentive, and I love the dimly lit atmosphere and decor, particularly the waterfall wall. Meals are on the pricer side, but it's a nice night out, so it makes up for it (appetizers are around $12, meals are around $18-38 each).  They have excellent cocktails for happy hour, too, even if they are a bit on the pricey side ($10-13). Soba has great ambience for happy hour, too -- comfy seats and plenty of room for chatting. Whether you come here for a drink or a meal, it's always a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"First a warning, the parking lot will most likely be full, because it's not just for Soba. See a parking space on the street? Take it.  Soba is a beautiful restaurant and lives up to the Big restaurant group expectations of unique flavors. The sushi is great, but if it was anything less than great I'd be worried about Soba. The grilled salmon was cooked perfectly with a wonderful coconut Thai sauce. The staff is very courteous, but I had a creeping feeling they were all \"egh a bunch of 22 year olds just walked in and they don't belong here.\"  We'll have to come back for drinks and dessert one day."}
{"text":"Fan.tastic.  I came here earlier this year for a Yelp Elite event, and have been waiting for a good opportunity to return ever since.  (Read: I wanted to come back with someone that would be into this type of décor and food as much as I am!)  The opportunity presented itself when one of my best friends and fellow foodie came to town to visit.  We split several small plates, a salad, and an entrée.  We were too stuffed for dessert, but I'm sure that would have been spot on as well.  My favorite small plate dish is the Chilean sea bass satays with a miso glaze.  It melts like butter in your mouth.  We had the Burmese tea leaf salad, which struck an excellent balance between a crunchy texture and bright flavors.  It was an excellent palate cleanser before  the main entrée, Korean fried chicken.  This chicken is so flavorful and crunchy sitting atop its bed of spicy puree and roasted veggies.  The vinegary dipping sauce took it to the next level.  Our service was a bit slow (or perhaps the kitchen was behind?), for which the waiter profusely apologized.  However, in this type of setting, we were completely fine to have a longer than average wait time because we were enjoying our conversation and the atmosphere, so it set a nice pace for the evening.  (Anyone used to dining abroad would probably think absolutely nothing of it.)  This place is truly unique and I appreciate the way that it's fairly upscale with services like (free) valet parking and a coat check, but is still accessible from the standpoint of being not \"Just for special occasions because that's the only way you can afford it\" type of restaurant.  Soba is definitely a real favorite of mine and I look forward to a return trip."}
{"text":"Delicate Asian cuisine. Love all the dishes we have ordered! And the price is lower than expected. Cocktail/wine special at $6"}
{"text":"Last night was the first time I went to Soba and I LOVED it! My friends and I got some tables in the lounge area and it was the perfect setting for a quiet Saturday night catching up with friends. The whole place has such a great vibe, the service was awesome, and the drinks were dee-lish! I can't wait to go back and have dinner there."}
{"text":"Soba is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. It is your standard Asian fusion fare.  I have a strategy I enjoy. I make a reservation on OpenTable set for right after happy hour.  The cocktails are excellent. The happy hour specials make it a great time. The bar is very nice.  The cocktail specials are balanced. Hard drinkers can get a strong drink, lighter drinkers can get a sweet drink. Everyone wins.  Given the special, I'm willing to take risks and try anything.  After happy hour, it is off to dinner.  The food is great. I particularly enjoy the fried rice, ramen, tuna, and the special courses.  My most recent visit was during the water festival. My meal was amazing.  Finally is the desert. The chocolate maki is absolutely amazing.  Overall, the drinks are great, the food is great, and the ambience is great."}
{"text":"We waited for our foods for over one and half hour and foods were awful. Extremely disappointed. First bad review ever."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I came here for an anniversary dinner last night. We were late for our reservation because we're bad at estimating traffic delays, but the service was still accommodating and friendly!   The inside is very hip and loungey, with tables accommodating couples up to large tables for bigger groups (there was a group of 10-12 people while we were there, and several groups of 8).  For drinks we had the plum and lychee sangrias. The plum sangria was super festive looking and both drinks were tasty and presented nicely! To start, we had the chicken spring rolls and crab corn chowder. The spring rolls came out fresh and hot with a sweet/spicy dipping sauce and the soup was hearty and warm!   For our meal, I got the bulgogi bibimbap and he got the chirashi bowl and a side of stir fried bok choy and mushrooms. The bulgogi was definitely huge - full of seaweed strips, marinated mushrooms, beef, bean sprouts, egg, etc. The chirashi bowl was beautiful and the fish was delicious. While everything was super tasty and filling, it was a bit salty for our taste and we packed some of the stuff to go.   Portion sizes were generous, so we didn't have room for dessert! Next time :)"}
{"text":"Soba is easy to review, being a simple, high quality, modern Asian restaurant. The food is excellent, building beautiful, and since they now have valet parking, the location is convenient. The menu is limited and wine list adequate. Our dinner last night consisted of a spicy chicken noodle dish, a beef noodle dish, and a shared crème brûlée desert. Everything was outstanding, as always. Unfortunately, our server was horrible. We sat for almost 15 minutes before seeing her and she was never there when we needed her. It was the first sub-10% tip I've had to give this century. Ouch! We won't let one bad server, however, degrade our opinion of this otherwise fine restaurant. Finally, it's important to note that this is a limited menu Asian restaurant, so if you're looking for meat and potatoes this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly friendly and quick.  We started with the squash dumplings(fried) and we both said we'd eat about 20 more of them; they were awesome! I had the yellow curry with chicken. It was delicious with the perfect amount of heat...and big enough for a lunch the next day.  The husband had the seared tuna and judging by what was left on his plate he clearly enjoyed it.  We also had an Old Fashioned and a Mule and both were delicious.  This place nailed it on every aspect...except it was probably one of the most expensive meals we've had since moving to Pittsburgh. That said, is most certainly eat there again."}
{"text":"I love going to Soba. I went there for my birthday dinner this year and they were extremely accommodating of my vegan needs (the crispy tofu is one of my favorite dishes in Pittsburgh), and for such a high-end restaurant their portions are great and satisfying. The ambiance, the decor, and the cocktails are beautiful and unique. Our server Albert was amazing! So attentive and fun, he really made my dining experience feel unique and special. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The menu here is very pricey, and some things are complete hits, and others are total misses, thus I give it a 3.5-star rating. We started with the crab and corn chowder (creamy, spicy and delicious - $8), chilean sea bass satay (large cubes of cod, cooked rare, tender, with a sweet, tasty sauce - $12). I had the shiitake dumplings ($9 - 5 or 6 in an order, fried, pretty good but nothing stupendous). We got the double salmon roll, which had a lot of mayonnaise on it for my taste, especially since this was not listed as an ingredient on the menu. I probably wouldn't have ordered it if I'd known. The fish was delicious ($14). We also got the hamachi sashimi, a favorite of my dinner partner's. He said the fish was great, but the fennel, apple and avocado sauce added to the dish were a total miss and detracted from the great fish underneath ($14). We both wished the hamachi had been combined with flavors that made more sense for its delicate flavors. Finally, we shared the red curry and rice, which neither of us particularly cared for. It is an all vegetable dish, with tofu, broccolini, butternut squash, and a fried egg I never found in the dish ($17). We opted to skip the entrees, which run from $22-34, and we were glad we did, as this amount of food more than filled us up, with enough for at least one meal of leftovers, despite coming very hungry. We finished our meal with the cashew terrine ($9), which was essentially a trio of pureed cashew and coconut milk bars served with chocolate sauce, candied cashews, and raspberry/passionfruit sauce. Finally, we had the port trio, all of which were wonderful and a relatively good deal ($14 for 3 small glasses).  At a previous event, we also tried soba's food, and got the chance to taste the crispy tofu (bland, but inoffensive, $9), roasted chicken ramen (delicious, $22, enough for leftovers), and pad thai (good, but way overpriced with too many noodles and costing $19, for something I could get at my neighborhood thai joint for $12-14)."}
{"text":"I went here for Valentine's Day and had their prix-fixe menu. I actually really enjoyed everything I had, but I found some of the dishes to be too sweet.   The portions were tiny, but since the flavor wasn't exceptional I thought the price was a bit high. I've eaten at Michelin star restaurants before and am used to high prices for small portions, but if you're going to give small portions I expect the food to give me \"wows and mouth-opening reactions of flavor.\" Expect Soba's food to be good, but not memorable.   The best part of the meal was the dessert. Their yuzu tart is excellent - perfect balance of tartness, sweetness, and crunch.   I would come back to try their regular menu, and I would recommend this place for a nice dinner. The actual restaurant has an spacious, but maze-like layout which I appreciated."}
{"text":"The weird thing about Soba is their appetizers are way better than their entrees. My husband and I split 2 appetizers and 2 entrees and I loved both appetizers, however both entrees were just ok.  The sea bass satays were amazing. If you love sea bass they're a must try. Also the double salmon roll was so good. The salmon was extremely fresh and melts in your mouth.  If I eat at Soba again I'm tempted to just order more appetizers/shared plates and skip the entrees.  Dessert was really good too. Ordered the chocolate peanut butter pretzel and it was delicious.  I highly recommend eating outside on their patio upstairs. Great setting and atmosphere.  If you wanna check out Soba I would recommend it however it's not one of my regular go to restaurants."}
{"text":"What really stood out was a clearly trained and dedicated staff. Well dressed, attentive, and professional. Refreshing and contributed overall to a great atmosphere.  The food was creative and  delicious. Not a single complaint.  BTW - try the Black Manhattan its not what your Daddy used to drink."}
{"text":"The hanger steak was to die for. The jalapeños on it brought a welcome amount of heat to balance the sweet on the dish. Absolutely delicious. Spicy tuna roll was just that. I wasn't a big fan of the spring rolls, but my dinner date loved them. Nice dark ambience. The service left a bit to be desired. Server was new, and it in no way ruined the fine dining experience, but little things were overlooked. Items that were clearly not being used (chopsticks, soy sauce pot) were left on the table through dessert. Our server knew the menu well and made recommendations per food category, which I'm sure he was trained to do. But a suggested 'favorite' for each of 6 sections on the menu was a bit long-winded and just too much. Overall a nice experience, but 5 star service and attention to detail would get it to the actual 5 star mark."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I came to Soba (my surprise to her) for our Valentines dinner this past weekend and had an amazing time.  The ambiance and music were exemplary and the wait-staff was very helpful, knowledgable and courteous!  The food (Thai Corn Chowder, Steam Squash dumplings, Bah Mi Bao Buns (the last two appetizers are on the \"to share\" section and that's what we did) the Tuna and lobster rolls for her and the Pad Thai for me) was all excellent in taste and presentation.    I'm just giving a 4 out of 5 to an amazing dinner because: 1) it could be more clear (specifically, written on the menu for example) that the Pad Thai automatically comes with Chicken, Shrimp and Tofu and 2) the portions for the main courses were too huge (I had enough pad thai for 2 more meals at least) for both of us (but especially on the pad this, which on its own, sans any appetizers is easily two meals) and that the chicken on mine was a little too blackened for my taste; and  3) the service was a little fast between courses.   Overall though, an excellent meal the two of us are still talking about!"}
{"text":"This review is more general as opposed to a single visit, and applies to Soba post renovation.   Going here, the more expensive price is expected, and honestly worth it. I don't mind paying more money when the food is delicious, the service great on all levels, and the ambiance enjoyable. Soba achieves all three with flying colors. The first time I came with a large group and sat in the main dining area, and we were accommodated very well with fast flawless service. We ordered a variety of dishes and I can't say I disliked any. I normally hate tofu, but I even enjoyed the fried tofu dish. I've come back twice since then, to eat in the bar area. Whether the place was crowded or less busy, there was no variation in the high quality of food and the speed and friendliness of service, a rare accomplishment.   My advice for people coming here is to order a bunch of appetizers to share. The variety of flavors and foods is remarkable and it gives you a chance to experience the diversity this kitchen is capable of without investing a lot in one dish. That isn't to say that the entrees aren't also amazing, but this will help you have an idea of what you like best here and pick entrees that suit your tastes. But don't forget to make space for dessert. Their drink menu is also quite extensive, especially their offerings of a variety of sake to suit any dish or preference ranging from a standard carafe of warm sake to some limited edition bottles.   If you're in the mood for Asian food and want some great fusion cuisine, this is the place to go. It's also a great place for a date or happy hour with colleagues/clients. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday dinner and it exceeded my expectations. Soba is a pan-Asian restaurant and they definitely showed the Asian influence in their food. I had ordered the seared rare tuna and it was cooked perfectly while my boyfriend went with the salmon entree (cooked medium rare).   The atmosphere is very intimate, with low lighting and candles and a waterfall wall.  The food was delicious and the waiter was attentive and informative. Would definitely go back! Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Went here for anniversary dinner after last minute search on yelp. Great food - my boyfriend was nervous about trying Asian fusion for the first time but we were able to get familiar and delicious spring rolls and dumplings for appetizers.  For dinner we got seared tuna and scallops, our first foray into Pittsburgh seafood after moving here from NJ, and were not disappointed.  They have an extensive wine list (I had two generous glasses of angeline pinot noir) and a great-looking cocktail menu (I don't usually go for hard liquor but I found myself uncharacteristically indecisive with so many interesting-looking choices).  Pricey, but on par for the quality of food plus cocktails - would go back on another special occasion.  Also pleased to find they have a (albeit small) parking lot."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding restaurant that we would frequent more often if doing so did not require payment of a $50 surcharge (for babysitting).  I particularly enjoy things such as the tuna tartare, and the wonderful fusion dishes that they have created.  This is not a \"stick to your ribs type of place.\"  The quantities are generally not enormous, but then most of us can afford (weight and calorie wise) to sacrifice quantity for quality.  This is not a hostile place for kids, but... unless your kids are pretty adventurous there are limited selections on what is available to eat, i.e., no chicken nuggets or mac and cheese."}
{"text":"We started our dinner sitting on the deck but soon had to move inside because it started pouring and rain was coming through the tarp a little bit. The host was very accommodating in getting us another table.  Food-wise the corn chowder was excellent. Didn't know it was possible to make a corn chowder that tasty. Crab cake was also good, almost no filler at all. Pure fresh crab meat.  I had the halibut for entree, which in and of itself was pretty good. Cooked just right. However I soon found out that the rare tuna that my friend ordered was way better. So there's that. In case you are unsure which fish dish to pick, get the rare tuna.  Finished the night with a banana split, which I'd recommend as well."}
{"text":"The best thing about my recent experience at Soba was the service.  The waitstaff were unobtrusively attentive and very friendly.   I highly recommend the chicken ramen, which has fried chicken, noodles, and a fried egg.  I'm not sure how you can go wrong with that combination of ingredients.  The true star of the meal was the dessert - some sort of chocolate mousse and pretzel stack that was really amazing and made in-house.   My only quibble is that some menu items are pricey considering what they are - I mean, $18 for fried rice?"}
{"text":"Only went there once -- it's nice, but not so rave-worthy as other reviews might imply except in comparison to the other offerings in Pittsburgh. Food was good but IIRC, the portions are small -- you end up spending a lot of money in order to feel moderately full. Drinks are good."}
{"text":"We were seated at 7:20 and our cocktails took 20 minutes to receive.  Sitting in the lounge is quite a nice experience, but not when you're waiting for your cheer.  The waitress was non existent after that, actually the GM was walking by and took our order.  Again the waitress brought half our order and we waited (it was noticeable and shouldn't have been...kinda like your heart beating, if you notice it, somethings wrong) for the other half which never came.  We actually left without even having it wrapped but having paid for it.  Frustrated at the sssslllooooowwwwwww service and lack of attention.    Although the food tasted good, there is an incredible amount of competition in the area, we will not be returning in the next 5 years."}
{"text":"It's been 3 days since Yelps Swingin to Summer event and I had to get my Soba fix in. Pulling up to the restaurant you will see they have a valet service (tip based) which is awesome since parking in Shadyside can get tricky. I have seen a lot of pictures of the bar and lounge area from other reviews but I was really blown away by the interior design of the dining room. It was very modern and upscale! I also really loved the sliding doors it really opened up the area and let in a nice breeze.   I knew going into this dinner the filet satay was a must and so were the pork belly buns. My mom wanted to try the spicy chicken lettuce wraps so we ordered that as well. With the filet satay you get 3 skewers that come with 4 pieces of filet that basically melt in your mouth! The pork belly buns were also heavenly. There was a nice mix of flavors happening here, sweet and tangy! Last but not least the spicy chicken lettuce wraps delivered as well. My mom did say they were the best chicken lettuce wraps she has ever had and she is a big chicken lettuce wrap eater. They were not spicy at all which is what she was originally worried about. The halved peanuts, green peppers and caramelized onions really added extra flavor and crunch. The portions were very generous for these all being shareable. Next time I would like to try the Korean bbq ribs for sure!   Soba you are definitely on my favorite restaurant list and I recommend everyone to try it for themselves."}
{"text":"After several incredible experiences at UMI, I decided to give Soba (next door) a shot.   The design of the place is awesome. Definite 5 star for ambiance; unfortunately the food did not fair as well.  chicken and vegetable springrolls: hot mustard sauce, nuoc chom - these were tasty but the description fails to mention that they are fried and a bit too oily. The nuoc chom sauce that accompanied the dish was possibly the highlight of the meal. Like a very light sweet and sour.The hot mustard was passable but nothing special  calamari: chilies, toasted garlic, mint, uni emulsion -I was hoping for a raw or lightly grilled calamari presentation, I guess I should have asked. Again, soba fails to mention these are fried.  As fried calamari go..these were delicious. The uni emulsion was more of an uni-mayo sauce..and the chilies/toasted garlic/mint sprinkled along side added some great flavor.   wild barramundi: sushi rice cake, summer vegetable ratatouille, ssam jang, thai basil -I liked the flavor of the fish, the rice cake and vegetable ratatoille, however; they were all too oily. I'd like a light sear on the fish, but this was like a deep pan fry on one side. Veggies were a bit to oily as well. The ssam jang was too vinnegary in my opinion.   vegetarian pad thai: zucchini, green beans, bok choy, tofu, peanuts, mung bean sprouts, cilantro -rather bland and again absolutely soaked in oil.   Service was acceptable, but nothing special.   Overall, I much, much prefer UMI and can't wait until Mr. Shu get's back from vacation. I probably won't be back to Soba, I'll opt for Tamari if I'm in a fusion mood."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks. Initial impressions from ambience and cocktails were good. Appetizers were mostly good, especially the buns. Sushi was decent. However the red curry was one of the worst I've had.  It's really pricey for the portions and quality. I might come back for a quick cocktail and app."}
{"text":"I really love Soba!  Soba has been around forever...possibly 20 years?  It's been one of my favorite dining spots in town for a long time.  It's at least 15 yrs old bc I had my 21st birthday dinner there.    I recommend you make reservations before dining here, and you can do it electronically through their website, its really easy.  Before your dinner I urge you to have cocktails in their bar.  Its a lovely space, in fact I've come here just for cocktails.  The restaurant itself has a really cool vibe to it.  Asian fusion meets dark wood?  I dont know how to explain it, but its a beautiful restaurant perfect for a romantic dinner, dinner w/ girlfriends, or even a business meeting.  I like to sit out on the covered patio.  In fact the last time I was there, it poured rain and it was actually kind of romantic and cool to hear the rain.    But anyway the food...the food...  You're not going to leave stuffed but you will leave happy.  I love thier crispy tofu appetizer and miss it when I haven't had it in awhile the way some people miss their ex's.  I usually order the pad thai when here, it is delicious and balanced and not too salty.  If they have scallops on the menu, get those.  They're fantastic.  I dont like chocolate, ever, at all--but their chocolate maki dessert is to die for.  Soba is not cheap, but I do think it's completely reasonable.  They've got a great wine list and the service is always great."}
{"text":"I LOVE SOBA! It might seriously be my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I started coming here when I was an employee for Mad Mex, since we got a discount one day of the week. But my husband and I have continued coming here over the years for special occasions, because it's so good!  The fried tofu appetizer is incredible. I'm a vegetarian, but my husband is not and usually doesn't like tofu - even he gets excited for the fried tofu.  We have both tried various menu items and drinks here, and everything has been top-notch. The atmosphere inside is beautiful, and if it's nice outside, it's nice to sit on the covered patio. We always look forward to an occasion to come back here and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a romantic or just delicious evening!"}
{"text":"In the last year, I have gotten through most of the Big Burrito restaurant chain, and I have now conquered Soba too.  I came to the lounge area on Thursday night with a friend around 7:30 PM.  We got the two last seats together, other than two at the bar, which is pretty impressive for a Thursday night.  Foremost, of the Big Burrito group, Soba might have the best atmosphere.  The lounge was similar to the upscale ones in New York, Chicago, D.C., etc., and I love that.  The drinks were really reasonable ranging from about $9-$12, although I mostly drink in the aforementioned cities so maybe slightly higher than the Pittsburgh average.  I ordered two Cucumber Collins ($11) drinks, which contained effen cucumber vodka, nigori, lime, and agave nectar.  This drink was light and refreshing and definitely not weak.  The wait staff was super laid back and disorganized, which is typical for this chain, but I don't mind it in this atmosphere.  All in all, I would definitely come back here for a drink.  Dinner is very far out of my budget here, but I am sure it would be good too."}
{"text":"Incredibly stylish.  This is a place where you are impressing the people you bring from the moment you walk in the door.  The water down the rock wall is amazing as we walked to the second floor.   Food was all good...I think our favorite was the crispy spicy tofu.  Don't be afraid of the peppers strewn on the tofu.  It's great.  And the mushroom pad thai was excellent too.  If I had one quibble, I'm not sure that I'd classify this as vegetarian friendly.  When we said 'vegetarian' just about the first thing the waitress asked was, 'so is fish ok?'  I expected a bit more understanding than that, and two of us ordered almost every vegetarian dish on the menu.  So, hard to go back and get anything different the next time, and if we were in a bigger group we would be doubling up on dishes if we were all sharing.  So--in my opinion, vegetarian friendly is a generous statement.  If I were Soba I might figure out how to add a few more items, maybe off menu.  But--still, love walking into that space!"}
{"text":"Soba is big Burrito's (a Pittsburgh restaurant management company) Asian Fusion restaurant. My girlfriend took me here the other day for my birthday dinner and we were not disappointed with our experience. The decor here was hip and relaxing, sort of a zen/feng shui vibe. Not sure if it met actual taoist standards, but it definitely appeals to the average Westerner (could that sentence be more pretentious?). Service was friendly and well informed, our waiter answered all of my questions.  Anywho, the food here was really great. We started with the steamed pork dumplings and the chilean sea bass satays. The dumplings were yummy but not inspired. The satays, LORDY, those were fantastic. No Joke, the chilean sea bass satays were the best seafood dish I've ever tasted. The fish was buttery and sweet, but complimented with lemon juice to balance it out with some acidic flavoring and DANG, it really was fantastic. Do yourself a flavor and order the chilean sea bass satay if you go to Soba. For my main course, I had the dolsot bi bim bap. The searing rice bowl was delicious, I had to eat around some of the spicier parts but it was still yummy. My girlfriend got the tuna steak, which was seared beautifully. Really generous portions for the entrees: we both brought stuff back home.  Soba is sweet, I do not have any criticisms from my experience with the food and staff here. While it was a great experience, I am not giving 5 stars because I beginning to realize that 5 stars means I regard the experience as \"perfect.\" I do not regard this experience as perfect because there was a first date sitting next to my girlfriend and I and it was not going well. He could really have let her talk more, but it seemed like she did not have anything interesting to say. It was very awkward. I was happy when they left. Food was great though. Woo!"}
{"text":"I was here this past week while visiting. The food was superb. The seared tuna was amazing-the best I've had anywhere. The scallops were also excellent. Appetizers were delicious. The restaurant is beautiful, dimly lit, and very relaxed. Our server, Amanda, was great-really knowledgeable and helpful. Lookinf forward to my next trip to Pitt. to come back here."}
{"text":"The crab meat corn-chowder appetizer is the finest appetizer I have ever had in my life. I have been to most of the great restaurants in New York City over the past 30 years, and that statement stands.  Just fabulous."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday and the experience and food was great! It's beautifully decorated and had a very nice outdoor terrace that we were seated at. Everything we ordered was very flavorful and the portions were larger than what I was expecting which is never a bad thing in my book. Our waiter was also so nice I wanted to be best friends with him, haha. Safe to say I had a wonderful birthday and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went to Pittsburgh for the first time to visit my friend and we were trying to choose a restaurant for dinner.  Like I do when I visit any new city, I researched the best restaurants in the city based on yelp, food websites and word of mouth.  My friend and I came across Soba as a highly regarded restaurant.  Friends who live in Pittsburgh mentioned that Soba was a great choice.  The interior of Soba reminded me of a restaurant in NYC.  The inside looks very modern with a lot of wood and glass material and is spacious with multiple floors.  There is complimentary valet parking at Soba which makes parking easy.    We chose the crispy calamari as an appetizer and shared the thakkali curry and pad thai for the entrees.  The crispy calamari was okay - similar to crispy calamari I had at other restaurants.  The thakkali curry was very salty and there was not enough liquid to balance out all the vegetables.  We had trouble eating the curry as the sauce was very pungent.  The pad thai was nothing spectacular - definitely had better in NYC and Philadelphia.  The portion sizes of all the food that we ordered were very generous.  I did not appreciate the lighting in the restaurant as it was very dark and I could barely read the menu or tell what was in my food.  Unfortunately, we may have ordered the wrong food as we heard such great reviews about Soba."}
{"text":"Soba is my absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Soba is consistent with high quality service and cuisine.  I have been going to Soba for well over 10 years, and I have never been disappointed.  I highly recommend eating the pad thai and washing that down with a fussy monk or  two.  Soba also has great happy hour specials. I highly recommend you visit Soba!"}
{"text":"Soba is a nice place to go for dinner, but I probably won't be coming here again. The food is pretty good, but paying $22 for ramen when I could go to Ramen Bar for half the price is just not very appealing. The pricing is comparable to Legume, but the food is far less unique. Also, the flavors were a bit bland, though I guess for a \"fusion\" place that is normal.   I will say that the ambience of this place is amazing. It is dim, but not too dark, and all of the furniture and decor is chosen with an eye for modern elegance. The bathrooms are beautiful and well-maintained (hey, bathrooms are important in a restaurant!).   All in all, a nice place to take a group of picky eaters who won't enjoy the less-traditional establishments. I would recommend it for business meetings."}
{"text":"Went here for my husband's birthday and they have a very nice outdoor seating area. I wasn't a huge fan but my husband loved it and compared it to being on the same scale as Eleven so that's why it gets a 4 star rating.   We ordered the korean barbeque ribs $12) which fell off the bone and the calamari with chilies, toasted garlic, mint and an uni emulsion ($9).   My husband had the seared rare tuna - sesame crust, korean bbq, kim chi, cucumber-red onion  salad, ginger fried rice and peanuts ($34) which he loved. I had the spicy basil noodles with broccoli, onion, button mushrooms, baby bok choy, orange peel, sesame seeds and fried egg ($17). I ordered it spicy but found it to have a strange taste.   For dessert we had the frozen cashew terrine which had chocolate ganahce, mango-rasberry coulis and candied cashews for $8."}
{"text":"I have dined at Soba more times than any other restaurant in Pittsburgh; it is my favorite! The dishes are original and creative, not like anything one can find elsewhere. I don't like tofu so much, but their tofu appetizer is fantastic - and is a large portion for a moderate cost. The chopped salad is worthy of my daily cravings. They usually have two vegetarian entrees, one or both of which can be made vegan. For a long while they had an awesome rice cake dish that I could not resist - it was a take on pesto with neato chewy rice cake noodle things and a seasonal mix of veggies and mushrooms. I do miss that one. But lately I've been getting the thakkali curry, which is pretty good too, with an interesting take on mango pickle (spicy!) and sadly, it comes with the best paratha in town.   Once I had a bad experience with the rice cake dish - it came out all wrong. I was unable to complain at the table due to my company...but I emailed the manager because I wanted them to know that somebody in the kitchen didn't seem to be gettin' it. I also took that opportunity of contact to ask for a recipe for some to-die-for brussels sprouts they used to have on their sides menu that were no longer available. The response was above and beyond what I could have expected. Everything was made up for and then some. And they apparently didn't have the recipe I requested on record, but gave me a general run down of how to make it from memory; now I make them at home according to Soba's instructions every time!  The drinks! Excellent. Some of my favorites are The Metamorphosis (no longer on menu, but I think you can still get it), Offer You Can't Refuse, The Dirty Pickle, La Pinta and Beauty Mark...They also have a nice selection of Sake, which is rare in Pittsburgh, however is is expensive to buy here.   The atmosphere is not really my style, but it passes as a cool calm romantic space. I do get sick of hearing the same music every time I go, but there are some great songs in the mix. The service is hit or miss, and some of the servers come off as scripted (probably new). Our last server was really slow about checking on us and drinks took a long time (though it wasn't busy). And as with most Big Burrito restaurants, I don't like that there are separate food runners from servers, because it makes it confusing and more time consuming to ask for things. I prefer the bar seating and service, usually.   All in all, I think Soba is Pittsburgh's best place to eat and drink."}
{"text":"The night I moved to Pittsburgh in January 2010, I went to Soba with my parents. My mom was so obsessed that we had to go every time they visited. I loved it too, but after realizing there were so many other worthy restaurants to try in Pittsburgh, Soba fell by the wayside, to the point where I figured that maybe I was playing it up to be better than it actually was in my head.  I ended up going back to Soba for dinner this week since it's right around the corner from my new place. And it was actually just as good as I remembered! I was upset that there was nothing pork belly related on the menu (that was always my favorite here), but ended up getting yellowtail sashimi, scallops with a peach jam, and the chopped salad. The chopped salad here, which changes with the seasons, is possibly one of my favorite salads of all time. There's always like ten thousand ingredients in it and it's always super refreshing (this time there was nectarine, coconut, cucumber, avocado, mint...).  I wish the restaurant wasn't QUITE so dark (this seems to be the trend in all Big Burrito restaurants) and we were being stared down by a snobby older couple the entire time (we dined at 10pm, and were dressed to go out afterward...I don't know if it was my friend's tattoos or the fact that I was wearing a crop top that was so offensive, but they were NOT having it!), but otherwise it was an all-around awesome experience. Our waitress was super nice and down-to-earth and didn't make us feel like we were out of place at all. So, Soba, you have managed to maintain your 5-star rating from me, and I'm so very sorry I've been neglecting you!"}
{"text":"We found Soba to be very unique and relaxing. We absolutely loved the smooth rock water feature expanding two floors and an entire side of one wall. Very peaceful.  We tried their farm feast tasting menu event for $35 per person, including four courses. You may also accompany the courses with a wine paring for $20, giving you four different types of wine with each serving. We thought the cost was a great value.  The thing I love most about a tasting menu is that you don't have to worry about decisions. The menu is already planned. I'm sure many people would have an issue with this, but as a foodie, there is nothing better than to experience new cuisines. If you are one of those picky people, you can order off Soba's Japanese-fusion style menu.  Because we were blown-away from the atmosphere, outstanding service, and talented chefs, Soba made our Pittsburgh Favorite list at www.GirlLikesToEat.com//pittsburghfavorites/  This is for sure an exquisite dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food. They did a great job with the renovation- the place is swank!"}
{"text":"Soba is a safe option when you want to have a fancy dinner and you're willing to go pricey, but not excessively pricey. I live in the neighborhood, and I come here with my boyfriend when we want to treat ourselves to a nice dinner but also don't want to travel far or take an Uber to do it. The cocktails are solid and the ambience is elegant - great whether you're coming here for food or just drinks. There are some dishes my boyfriend and I get every time we come: the pork buns and the rock shrimp tempura. Their sushi is also great. We've also had the bi bim bamp and the pad thai before; they're okay, but not outstanding. For entrees, I'd recommend sticking to the clay pot duck or the fried rice. The reason I give this place 3 stars is because of its service. I find it to be incredibly inconsistent. Sometimes it's great, but other times I've found the waiters to be lazy or forgetful. Given the price of this place, I expect to always have amazing service, but this hasn't been the case. I'll keep coming, though, because the food is good and is conveniently placed near where I live."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great. They have their own valet parking, amazing atmosphere surrounding the restaurant. I'm not a big fan of dim light because I have to turn on my flashlight to look at the menu lol. The service is friendly and entertaining.  Looking at there menu, this restaurant have three kinds of cuisine mix in them. To be honest it's four. Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai. Me and my friend ordered \"Rock Shrimp Tempura, Corn Chowder Soup,\" for the Appetizers, and for the entree. \"Spicy Cantonese beef noodle\" aka \"Beef Chow Fun\" lol and \"Thai Curry Chicken\" The appetizers were great and the Rock Shrimp Tempura taste decent. As for my entree I was a little dissatisfied with my portion. My \"Spicy Cantonese Beef Noodle\" the portion size is great can serve for two. I have ate at numerous of restaurant that have \"Beef Chow Fun\" too. Each of them are good. This place there spicy Cantonese beef noodle disappointed me! It was really salty, the beef chunk are big but that is fine. Just the dish too salty and the noodle need to be boil a little longer. It was a little too hard. I wrote this because \"Beef Chow Fun\" is one of my favorite food that I had since my childhood to present! I know each restaurant have their own special way of making them for a regular person who have ate this dish can tell the different immediately.    This restaurant the price is little bit above average. That is fine, as long it taste good. Anyway a great place for date and romantic dinner for couple."}
{"text":"Elie and I came in for happy hour drinks and I'm really glad we did.  The bar is lovely, and the actual restaurant is really nice.  The drinks were delicious and strong, and everything from the sour pickle martini to the smoky mezcal was excellent. We had two drinks each, sampling four decadent cocktails for only $24.  I heart happy hour, and this one rocks.  The food looked great, worth trying next time around."}
{"text":"Over the past 4 years or so, my rating for Soba has regularly swung between 3-4 stars. Because my experiences during recent visits have been positive, I am hoping that the 4 stars will stick this time.  One of Soba's consistent strengths is its ambiance. It offers a swank, contemporary atmosphere (and, unsurprisingly, with an Asian feel). The lighting is soft and pleasing -- great for romantic dinners, but still appropriate for business meals as well.   The menu also reflects a contemporary but Asian influenced theme. The dishes are a little less innovative than Tamari's, but they are generally well thought-out and well prepared. I especially recommend the beef short ribs (strong and complex flavors) and the fillet mignon (super tender and juicy). The kitchen sometimes seem to have temperature control problems. I have had disappointing seared tunas (over done) and on a recent visit, my \"medium rare\" fillet would probably be considered \"very rare\" by most restaurants in Pittsburgh.  The dessert is overpriced, but I have a special soft spot for the perennial chocolate maki."}
{"text":"The soba cocktail hour (their fancy way of saying happy hour) is a straight-up excellent deal. Delicious, complex cocktails that normally run $10-12 are $6 apiece. And they're pretty strong! As for the food, I can only comment on the appetizers. They're overall tasty, although by no means spectacular. The Korean kim chi pancakes are delicious, filling, and a good option for sharing.  I've only sat in the lounge area, which somehow manages to be both sleek and comfy. When it's summertime and you get one of the seats next to the large windows facing onto Ellesworth, well, it's pretty divine."}
{"text":"This was my first dining experience in Pittsburgh and it was a very nice evening.  I had wine, seared raw tuna and the Chocolate Maki with associates from work.  The service was fast and polite the atmosphere was pleasant.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"Gosh, I did not anticipate the sheer size of what I was ordering. I ordered a lot of food assuming it would be small portions of everything! I was wrong.   I ordered two appetizers and a main course. They didn't have a whole lot of veg options but the ones they had looked totally delicious so I didn't mind! I got crispy tofu. Came with jalapeños, cilantro and peanuts! A bit spicier than I expected but it was actually incredible. The sauce with the slight sweetness, spice and cilantro was amazing. The peanuts neutralized it perfectly. It was a huge bowl. I couldn't even finish half!  For my second appetizer, I ordered the squash dumplings. You can either steam them or fry them and I chose steamed. Really good, also surprisingly spicy. The squash and mushrooms actually went well together and the sauce added a salty flavor. There was an appropriate amount of this appetizer.  I ordered a completely vegetarian version of the pad thai. They have a vegetarian suace they sub it with and even include vegetables. I thought it was pretty tasty. I got very nervous because of how insanely large it was! I felt like I could have fed at least 3 other people with what I was attempting to tackle. I liked it but maybe cut down on the size!  The service was just okay. Very friendly but also very slow. We waited a long time without water which was not pleasant with the surprisingly spicy food."}
{"text":"I was expecting so much more out of this place, after several people called it one of the best places in Pittsburgh. I'm new to the area but I've eaten out enough to know that it really isn't in the league of the best. The food is acceptable for a $$$ place, but that is it. It just doesn't pop. It doesn't make you want to come back and try the next dish. It's more of a place that you go to for the atmosphere than to get an exceptional meal."}
{"text":"Classy, fancy place. They offer complimentary valet parking next to the restaurant. Has a low light, candle lit interior. The service was prompt, and the waitresses were courteous. We got the black cod, wish was amazing, but didn't really come with anything else, and by itself was a little small. However, the duck clay pot, pad thai, and bi bim bap, all had decent portions. The duck was succulent. The pad thai and bi bim bap were also good, but hard to tell much difference from good but cheaper thai / korean restaurants."}
{"text":"After reviewing some of the top restaurants in Pittsburgh I decided that this would be a great place to celebrate our anniversary. I had fairly high expectations and I can honestly say that they were all met! On Open Table I requested a quiet table and the request was honored, which is always a huge plus. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly, even when I asked to exchange my cocktail since I thought the one I ordered was a  bit sour. Fortunately the second cocktail made with honey and gin was amazing!  For an appetizer we shared the hamachi sashimi and it was perfectly delicious. For our entree we shared the ahi tuna and it was very fresh and well-seasoned. The Korean barbecue sauce served over the tuna was on the spicy side, but not too much so, the ginger fried rice and kim chi served alongside were also very good. For our dessert we shared the chocolate maki and wow, it was amazing! This is definitely a must if you visit this restaurant! It's incredibly decadent and certainly large enough to share. Taste aside, the presentation makes it worth trying: in place of ginger they serve freshly grated melon and what looks just like wasabi is actually whipped pistachio cream.   I'd definitely visit this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Decent meal but nothing to write home about. That said, I cleaned my plate! It's a little too dark inside (even the server said he couldn't see our table!). Service is attentive and friendly though. We shared tempura shrimp (totally addictive though a little sweet for my taste) and I had black cod (nicely cooked, good flavor, sauce is a bit gloopy). My friends had Pad Thai which they said was a bit bland and the noodles were too heavy. Last time I was in Soba must have been 20 years ago and I'm sure I will be back. But not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Soba, Pittsburgh     I'm a fan of the Big Burrito Group- they're successful for 2 simple reasons: they have good food, and provide stellar service.     Saturday evening a group of us braved the 32-degree spring weather, and had dinner at Soba in Shadyside.     The décor at Soba was minimal, but tasteful. Small polished stones were placed in front of each place setting, complimenting the wooden--faced menus. Our host was running a few minutes late, so I did some exploring. To the right, just beyond the hostess stand was a single, elongated, VIP table. Above the seating area was a large, organic wall with cascading water- if you've ever seen those really cool Zen-like mini pug-in H20 displays at Bed Bath and Beyond, it's like one of those- on a grand scale.  The bar/lounge area located at the far end of the restaurant was filling up with hip, well-dressed patrons eager to socialize and sip trendy cocktails. The lighting was dim and warm throughout; most of the diners were using the flashlights on their cell-phones to peruse to decipher the menu. Comfortable couches were scattered about making for a fun, informal meeting spot.     As I sat at our table waiting for everyone to arrive, I asked our server what he recommended.     \"Black cod for sure,\" he said.     Now that I had decided on my entrée, it was time to review the starters.     The Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps looked good (12), as did the Edamame (9), Jumbo Lump Crab Spring Rolls (13), Rock Shrimp Tempura (12), and Lobster Roll (15). We ended up sampling ALL of these plates, as well as the sweet corn and crab chowder.     The Spring Rolls were impeccably fresh, and the crab sweet and succulent. My favorite appetizer however, was the Rock Shrimp Tempura prepared with spicy aioli, tsumi, ponzu, and chives.  Another fantastic dish was the Sweet Corn and Crab Chowder that included curry, and FULL FAT coconut milk.  Between courses we opted for the Soba Chopped salad- a perfect combination of taste and texture with fresh papaya, mango, daikon, creamy avocado, iceberg lettuce, mint, basil, cashews, and coconut tempura- a spicy tempura dressing completed the dish.  With our palates adequately cleansed, we chose our main courses. Miso Black Cod (30) for me please- also ordered: Tandoori Scottish Salmon (27), Seared Rare Tuna with Sesame Crust (30), and Filet Mignon (38).     The fish was served in a medium-sized ceramic bowl, and included barbequed pork, rice cakes, bok choy, ssam jang, and pine nuts. The cod was buttery and rich- the barbecued pork was delicate, yet flavorful. A tangy miso broth puddled at the bottom of the bowl, and was quickly lapped up with my soupspoon.     I had the opportunity to try the Seared Tuna, and Scottish Salmon- both delicious.     \"You have to order the Frozen Cashew Terrine,\" our host suggested.     I didn't want to upset him of course, so we ordered two for the table, along with some basil-lemon sorbet, and the Soba Banana Split.     The terrine was amazing- I had never had anything like it. The dessert had the texture of ice cream, but was more dense, and packed with flavor. Also on the plate was chocolate ganache, mango, raspberry coulis, candied pecans, and real whipped cream- I would go back just to eat this.     Soba serves amazing food- couple that with a great atmosphere, and flawless service, and you have a true winner."}
{"text":"Soba had become one of our regular spots for big family dinners. Most recently we came for my sisters birthday. I was able to get reservations for 7 at the last minute for Saturday night. We had a long table next to the waterfall on the first floor. It was a high top so it wasn't the most comfortable but for a last minute reservation it worked.  We started with the calamari which was delicious and then dived right into entrees. I had what I always get- the seared tuna. It's crusted with sesame seeds and comes with rice, BBQ sauce, Kim chee, and pickled vegetable. It's so delicious I never get anything else. I had bits of my moms duck which was also delicious and the boyfriends sea bass was amaze!   We did not stay for dessert at this visit but in the past I have enjoyed the ice cream with cashew dessert. Soba is really so good. And it looks to beautiful."}
{"text":"Food: 5 stars. Service: 3 stars.  Like others have said, Soba is by far my favorite of the Big Burrito Group.  The space is very unique with a dark ambiance of stone, wood and water.  The best part of our experience was the food.  We started off with the Crispy Tofu small plate.  This was far from small and was a lovely pile of fried tofu in a pad thai-like sauce which featured some good green onion and black pepper.  We then moved on to our entrees.  I had a very generous portion of short rib.  It was a very slow cooked, tender (but not too fatty) short rib atop a bed of roasted fingerling potatoes, sweet potatoes and carrots all topped by a lovely korean-like barbecue sauce and peanuts.  WOW!  My partner had a very tasty Hedgehog Mushroom, Rice Cake Noodle, Basil, Apple combination.  She is vegetarian and noted that Soba had some of the best and most original vegetarian options she has seen in Pittsburgh.  Lastly, the lower points of the meal.  The wine list, while somewhat extensive, was rather ho-hum and a bit overpriced on the low end (more moderate on the high-end).  Wines by the glass were a mediocre pour.  The service also left some to be desired.  When it became somewhat obvious we weren't going to throw down more than $100, our server became elusive and rather short with us when he did show his face.  In addition to his lukewarm, standoffish nature he did not offer any recommendations and his familiarity with the wine list seemed to be marginal at best.    Anyhow, he didn't ruin the meal and I can't wait to go back and have good service so I can rate this place the 5 stars it deserves!"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try Soba for dinner every time we go to Umi. I'm only in town a few times a year, so we finally made this a priority. The food was spectacular and the drinks and service were first class.  My wife had the whole bronzini, which I tried some of, and it was dynamite. Don't let the whole fish preparation intimidate you!  My entree was the seared tuna and it was quite good as well.  We enjoyed a great pinot noir that was recommended by our waiter and also had some great sparkling sake.  We waited for our table in the lounge and tried some cocktails -- all receive high marks.  We were seated near the water feature wall, which is a spot I would recommend. The lighting, mood, food, and service make this a great location if you're looking to impress or have a nice romantic evening.  I look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Soba Saturday night after Art All Night! Whew there were so many people in Lawrenceville! It was impossible to get in anywhere and my group wasn't willing to stand outside in the brisk air just to get in and have to fight for seating or even a drink. Soba was the perfect choice! Love, love it here.  I have been here to eat before but most nights it's such a busy place that we head elsewhere. Since all of Pittsburgh was on Butler St we got in and sat right down in the lounge next to the glass fireplace! I would love to do a photoshoot in this sexy space. There is always a romantic mood at Soba. Martini glasses clinking in a group cheers, a spectacular setting for a lovely evening and exciting conversation, discussing all the interesting art we just saw.  You have to try the Cucumber Martini, it is \"muah\" marvelous! I think my drinks all summer will be Cucumber themed because it is so light and refreshing!   I have this thing for Pad Thai, and I am searching the city for the best. So that is what I ordered last time I dined here. It was a pretty decent Pad Thai but I am still looking for one like I had years ago at Papermoon in Erie. It was the best I ever had in my life, no competitors yet. The appetizers I have tried are very good. This is an upscale dining establishment so expect that the food will be as well. They have a small lot that is always packed so you may have to drive around on the small side streets to find parking. I think this is one of the best spots in the city for a date night!"}
{"text":"This is an upper end Asian fusion place. Overall, I had a good experience here as the food tasted great, the service was good and the decor was nice. I wouldn't entirely say that the prices justify the experience, but hell, I was here on company business: \"back up the truck, whoo!\" I loaded up on lobster sushi and sampled a few appetizers such as kim-chi (huge bowl!) and chicken skewers. Not authentic fare, but tasty nonetheless. Recommended for those who have fat wallets.   Food Quality/Taste = 4 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 3 Stars Relative Price = 2 Stars Service = 5 Stars Experience with Staff = 4 Stars Decor = 4 Stars Clean (yes/no) = yes"}
{"text":"Only went here for drinks, but very impressed.  Sidecar was very strong, but not too strong that it wasn't drinkable.  The waiter had a ton of knowledge about different drinks they could serve.    Overall great atmosphere - young, talkative, fun crowd.  I would definitely like to go back again and try the food."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere (we asked to sit on the upstairs patio). The food was delicious and fresh. I appreciated the vegan options as well"}
{"text":"We recently had a phenomenal meal here. Wow I typically get the seared tuna as a main course because it is one of the best meals around, this time we decided to go with appetizers. I am glad we did. The rock shrimp tempura, lobster roll, and calamari were exceptional. But the Chilean sea bass was as good as it gets. I'm excited to go back to have the Chilean Sea Bass and the seared tuna. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Oh Soba... Always a tasty experience, but you always manage to screw up just enough to not make you a place I would brag about.  Tonight, I ordered the pad thai... meh.  I've had it twice here, and each time, a loser.  This time it had a great taste, but the after taste had too much of a carbon flavor for my palate.  However, the mussels were great and the braised ribs were excellent.  Nonetheless, I still have that burnt carbon taste in my mouth, hence the 3 stars.  Would I go back again?  Yes.  But just stay away from the pad thai."}
{"text":"The bar and restaurant has nice decor. Very upbeat. The calamari was good but not exceptional. The Chaing Mai curry was so spicy hot I couldn't eat it. The service was unattentive.  Has potential but presently over rated."}
{"text":"I would prefer to leave 2.5 stars.  I ordered the kimchi pancakes and a salad I think.  The pancakes were ok, a little mushy but flavorful.  I wish I could remember the other thing, but it was better.    The kicker was when I ordered a glass of Laphroaig.  When the bill comes, it is 75 dollars.  Apparently the only Laphroaig they have is 30 years old and no longer being produced.  And is 50 dollars a glass.  Drinking Scotch in Pittsburgh has been fun so far."}
{"text":"We ate here last wednesday before the \"debate\".  I had fried chicken and she had pad thai.  The food and service - generally speaking - were good, but the waiter forgot to put our order in and only let us know 25 min after we initially ordered that there was a \"computer malfunction\" and it didn't initially take our order.  Besides this somewhat major hiccup, the experience was really nice.  Portions are big and there are definitely other things I'd want to try on the menu.  Will have to go back and hopefully update my review."}
{"text":"We came here for my friend's birthday dinner last weekend after the Pirates game. My friend and her husband have been here on many occasions and really enjoy it; it was me and my husband's first experience at Soba. We had reservations for 6pm, but ended up arriving early, since after the Pirate game we just headed straight over. The hostess said that she could seat us right away, even though we were early. Although, this shouldn't have been a big deal since we were the only guests. My friend had originally booked a booth inside, but during the day we all agreed it wasn't too hot to sit outside. We were taken upstairs to their patio, which was very cozy and comfortable, with a nice view.  To be honest, I checked out the menu in advance and was a little hesitant, since there were things that I had never eaten and some I had never heard of! However, I'm always willing to give anything a try at least once. To drink, my husband had an iced tea. I got an Asian Plum Sangria: \"plum wine, merlot, peach, orange, pineapple\". It was tasty and refreshing, a little sweet but not bad. I was a little disappointed, hoping that it had actual pieces of fruit it in, which it did not.  Our friends suggested the Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps as an appetizer, they got an order and so did we. They were delicious! And, even sharing with the H, I was quite full from them. Since we ate a little at the game, we both decided not to get an entree. My husband got the Double Tuna Roll as his main course, which he said was very good. I went with the Crispy Calamari, which was described as having \"chilies, toasted garlic, mint, uni emulsion\". I asked the waitress about the sauce, which she described as not like mayonnaise, but the same consistency. And although a sea urchin, said it did not have a fishy taste. I was a little skeptical, so she said she would have the emulsion put on the side, since it normally comes drizzled on top. As I expected it would be, given how things were going so far, the calamari was delicious. It was fried, but very lightly breaded, not heavy at all. The sauce was, in fact, fishy, but I didn't mind it at all...it was also good. Besides the pieces my husband stole from me, I ate every last bite. Our friends both got dinners, my best friend had the duck. I had a small piece of it and thought it was quite good.  Our waitress was very friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. My only reason for not giving Soba 5 stars is the prices. While the appetizers and salad prices seem reasonable, the dinners appear a little on the expensive side for how much you get. I was perfectly full with sharing the appetizer and the calamari. I would like to try a dinner next visit, but feel that I would have to still get an appetizer to compensate.   Overall, the atmosphere was nice and relaxing. I liked how there are small little sections, so the place feels very private. Several groups came to sit outside while we were there, but it still felt intimate and not loud or intrusive. Would most definitely return."}
{"text":":(  Ehhhhhh   came here with a party of 5 on a friday night.  Seated us quickly, and we ordered drinks quickly and then....  it all went away.  As in no service and when our orders were taken they were all screwed up with missing entrees, missing drinks, and we waited at least 45 minutes for our food.  No, we did not order any super fancy dishes.  I don't know whose fault it was- the waiter or the kitchen or what but it was really really bad and I eat out all over the country all the time.  Worst service I've had in years and I'm a moderately tolerant fella.  Lost 3 stars for that.  Assuming the service was superb I'd give the food a 3/5.  Slightly above average.  I know this is supposed to be one of pittsburgh's best, and yes I am in Pittsburgh in the middle of \"why does anyone live here???\" which has zero michelin starred restaurants, but damn, it was not that great.  The interior design was also nice.  Good ambiance.  Best thing about the place- they have free vallet parking.  The lot was filled with Audis and bimmers and maseratis but the valets cheerfully took and parked my spectacular status symbol 1989 dodge grand caravan minivan.  They got the tip."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last night with my fiance and parents for dinner.  It had been awhile since the last time that I had visited Soba and it was nice to see that they had renovated the restaurant.  I have always found Soba to be a pretty cool place and these renovations have only helped.  One of the most distinct parts of the restaurant is a wall in the dining room that has water coming down it giving it a  waterfall-esque feel.  Beyond that there are three levels of dining which is pretty unique for Pittsburgh restaurants.  On this day we were seated on the second floor although I have eaten on all of them before.   Finally the bar section of the restaurant is also pretty cool with a nice bar and then the surrounding tables seated down pretty low to the floor which is probably to give it an Asian feel.  For dinner my fiance and I decided to start off the evening with the crispy tofu.  This is one of my favorite appetizers in Pittsburgh and it once again delivered.  I don't know how they get the tofu so crispy on the outside and yet still somewhat silky on the inside but they do consistently.  The dish is covered with a wonderful lemongrass sauce and garnished with some peanuts, scallions and jalepenos with the jalepenos being a new addition since the last time that I had tried it.  While I thought that the jalepenos added quite a bit to the dish, my mother, who normally doesn't handle any spice very well, did not and ended up with her mouth on fire.  For my entree I decided to go with the Dolsot Bi Bim Bap while my fiance went with the Pad Thai.  If you have never ordered dolsot bibimbap, the dish is served in an hot stone bowl with all of the ingredients on top of the rice and the rice against the bottom of the bowl which makes the rice crispy.  This version of bibimbap came with beef tips, poached egg, pickled shiitake, cucumber kim chi, mung bean sprouts, scallion, nori and goju jang.  While I enjoyed the general flavoring of my dish with everything mixed together, I was not too happy with a couple pieces of meat that were in my dish.  They were hard and if I had to guess, they had some tendon in them which is not what you are looking for whenever you are eating pre-cut beef tips.  Beyond my dish I was also able to try some of my fiances Pad Thai, specifically some shrimp from it.  It had some fabulous flavor with the slight natural sweetness of the shrimp combining with the taste of grilling.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back to Soba again in the future.  While this visit was not the best due to the beef tips (hence the four stars instead of the five stars I would have given on all previous visits), everything that I had still tasted good and I still think that Soba is in my top 5 list for restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last-minute and it turned out to be a great choice! The ambiance was great; we sat upstairs in a small room so it was quiet and calm. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable. She gave us a good wine suggestion and my martini was well-made. We had the mushroom dumplings for an appetizer and they were delicious. My dining partner does not do well with spicy food and they made her pad Thai un-spicy and it was great. My seafood hot pot had a slight kick to it and the seafood tasted fresh.   All-in-all I'd say it was a great meal in a nice place."}
{"text":"I ordered the rare tuna. It came slathered in barbecue sauce, peanuts, onions, pickled cukes, and mild kimchi, with spicy rice. I scraped the bbq sauce off, but the tuna had the texture of frozen. It was better with the sauce.   The place was lively, but full of people not easy on the eyes. I wound up paying $60 to sit near a dude in a beat up \"West Virginia\" tee and dirty Penguins baseball cap. There were a couple of older gentlemen with young dates, so an extra star for them.   A Port Authority bus stopped across the street covered in a large stencil of a bat, a baby, a dog, and a bird. \"Battery baby dog bird\"? Cool.   This is Shadyside, an old, nice neighborhood. Shadyside is fine dining from the 80s. It's worth driving--even inebriated--to Legume or Meat and Potatoes. Let's be real, you'd have to shoot someone for Pittsburgh Police to care."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Soba on a Thursday night with a friend.  Went around 6pm, no reservations, and were seated right away.  I was talking to my friend about my lack of knowledge of white wine when our waiter came over to fill up our waters.  He asked if I wanted to learn about white wines and offered us a tasting of 3 varieties. He had us try them without telling us what they were. The thoughtfulness and interest in pairing our wines with our dinner really made our night.  We started off with the crispy tofu, which I always get, and this time did not disappoint.  I had the mushroom and rice cake noodles and my friend had the seared tuna.  Both dishes were great, aside from the kim chi on my friend's plate that was not very good. My dish was on the spicy side, so make sure to ask about spice level if that concerns you."}
{"text":"I've been to Soba numerous times, mostly for drinks at their lovely bar, but most recently I enjoyed dinner with two Australians that were visiting for the weekend. We sat in the upstairs area which is just as sexy as the rest of the restaurant. I enjoyed a glass of Tempranillo, my guests enjoyed a carafe of sake. I strongly believe their wine prices lean toward the higher end, but it's Shadyside and I wouldn't expect anything different. I'm a fan of mussels, although I have yet to have better mussels than those served at nearby Point Brugges. The mussels at Soba were on the smaller side, although there were plenty in the bowl. The broth was good, although it was difficult to soak it up with the yummy pita that they served on the side. My guests both enjoyed their meals. We finished the evening up with a creme brulee. It was quite delicious although there was a very small piece of hard plastic that we found. We brought this to the servers attention. We greatly appreciated the dessert being removed from the bill, including our drinks. Despite this fluke, I will be back and will continue to support this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is right across the street from my office.  Great food and drinks and the ambiance is sweet."}
{"text":"The ambiance is good, but the food is better.   We started off with the Thai Corn Chowder and the Rock Shrimp Tempura- both were great, but I'm still thinking about the crispy yet light shrimp that I couldn't stop eating. The soup was a welcome departure from most lackluster restaurant soups, and was rich and creamy. We followed up with the Double Tuna Roll, which was nothing short of amazing. The fish was so fresh it was buttery, and was deliciously dusted with crispy tempura dust. Our main course, the Tandoori Salmon, was a bit of a letdown; we were promised a medium rare salmon that was served to us *very* well-done, and was seriously lacking in any sort of \"tandoori\" flavor. The lentils and raita sauce served on the side were the saving grace for this dish, making it both palatable and delicious. We were too full for dessert, but the creme brulee is on my list for next time!"}
{"text":"miso black cod, thats all I have to say!  BEST DISH!  the seared tuna is also quite tasty too.  for appetizers the grilled octopus is to die for!  seriously tasty.   great restaurant, great cocktails and all the food is amazing! don't get the chicken ramen, its very bland."}
{"text":"There have only been two superb fusion restaurants that I have been to in the world. There have been quite a few that were average and some that down right stunk. The problem with most fusion places that they rely on the principal that the sum will equal more than the parts and therefore, the parts do not have to be that good to begin with. Unfortunately Soba falls in that category.  For example the corn fritters we had, if you tried the fritters on their own they were barely passable, greasy, falling apart and not much flavor - a virtual fritter failure, however you wrap that mess in the bibb lettuce, put on a basil leaf and dip it in the sauce chili-soy sauce and all of a sudden it becomes a tasty little snack. But I still have to ask would this dish not be better if ALL the components were excellent?   The Thai corn chowder tasted good, but had a funny mouth appeal, grainy and lumpy at the same time and didn't look appetizing brownish yellow. We eat with our eyes, nose, taste and tactile feel so while this tasted good it didn't do so well on the other requirements.  The mushroom and spinach dumplings were actually very blah, relying on the red pepper dipping sauce for their flavor. However the chopped salad was excellent, so all is not dismal at Soba.  I could go on but you get the idea. The place is expensive for what you get, they should pay more attention to the parts, master making them correctly before you try fusing it into another cuisine to cover up your mistakes. Overall most people are not as picky as I am, we tried, it was good with some problems, problems that should not have been there at their price point.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat great food.. But the hosted Was MEAN! As hell rude bitch.. But FUN place to meet up with friend for drinks"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try Soba Lounge for the first time - as a fan of the Big Burrito Group, I couldn't pass on the opportunity. As soon as we entered we were asked if we wanted to sit at a table on the right, or at the bar. If want a lounge experience, I highly suggest going to the bar which has couches as well as bar seats (better for groups), if you want an intimate conversation (2-4 people), I suggest being seated to the right.  Food: We ordered the crispy tofu and mushroom & spinach dumplings for appetizers, the grilled salmon and spicy basil noodles for entrees, and shared the chocolate maki for dessert.  Crispy Tofu: Must eat for vegetarians or meat eaters. Cooked perfectly, with a tangy sauce  Mushroom & spinach dumplings: a little smaller than expected, but the red pepper dipping sauce did it in for us. The combination of flavors was great.  Spicy basil noodles: Seems pretty conventional to order here, but the waitress said that it was a \"signature dish.\" Pretty standard if you ask me, but nothing to complain about.  Chocolate Maki: We were excited for this, but unfortunately a tad disappointed. The pistachio cream and nuts were a great touch for the mousse, but the pistachio crepe had an awkward, rubbery taste to it.  Drinks: The management and staff have differing opinions on weather or not you can bring a drink (from the bar) to your table. To clarify: YOU CAN. Go ahead and order a drink at the bar (very good cocktails/martinis) and walk over to your table. If you're a gin drinker, I highly recommend the Bee Keeper (my favorite) and Gin Blossom. The bartenders aren't shy with alcohol, so keep that in mind.  Atmosphere & Service: The waitress was super helpful, and the atmosphere provided a good medium for a great conversation. Overall, great restaurant, but a little on the pricier side."}
{"text":"My family and I dined at Soba Lounge for my graduation dinner. While the ambiance and service were great and some of the dishes were delicious, many of the dishes were way too salty.  We decided to share the lobster maki and the sea scallops.  Both were good and the sea scallops were cooked perfectly.  My mom chose to get the grilled baby octopus and the chopped salad.  The baby octopus was very tender, but was a bit too salty.  The chopped salad was probably one of the best dishes I tried that night because it was so light and refreshing whereas everything else was on the saltier side. I got the seared rare tuna.  The tuna portion was sizable and I loved the crunchy texture of the crust with the melt-in-your-mouth rare interior. However I thought it could have done without the korean bbq sauce. I felt like there were too many flavors that were competing with the dish when all I wanted to do was taste the tuna. The cucumber and red onion salad was delicious but I did not like the kimchi at all.  Maybe it's because I'm Korean and more picky with kimchi but it was just too sour, which may be perfect for stews but is not really enjoyable for eating.  The ginger fried rice that came with my meal was a complete joke. It was so salty I could not take more than 3 bites of it and there was zero ginger flavor because all you could taste was the salt. My younger sister ordered the miso black cod, which she enjoyed although she said that it was a little over seasoned.  I got a bite of it and it was flaky and good. My older sister had the striped bass that she liked as well. My dad, however, got the pork and shrimp fried rice and was really unhappy with it.  The portion was massive but it didn't need to be because he barely made a dent in it.  Like my ginger fried rice, the pork and shrimp was way too salty.  Our waitress was really nice but I other than checking up on the food during the appetizers, she didn't ask about our entrees. I don't think my dad felt like making a fuss about it but when she asked if he wanted his meal to go because it was basically untouched, she didn't ask if there was anything wrong with it when he said no thanks.   For dessert, my older sister got the coconut macaroon tart, which she devoured.  I chose the frozen cashew terrine, which was also really good.  The raspberry coulis way overpowered the mango, but other than that, the dessert was good.   Overall, while there were good parts of the meal, I think you can't really overlook the general saltiness of many of the dishes.  I'm curious to see if it was just a fluke night and might want to go back since the restaurant was recommended by  many of my friends but there are so many other good restaurants in Pittsburgh that I don't know if I will choose to dine there again any time soon."}
{"text":"This is a copy of my review for the event that this fine establishment hosted. I was not aware that the review would not show up on their restaurant page. I am kinda new at this! But yeah... Here it is..            Overall experience with the drinks was really good. The tai mule gave me a little tickle in the back of my tongue, with a taste of lemon and mint. The sangria was served with a orange(of course) and was blended perfectly with fruity and wine. The desert drink was different for me as I don't usually drink something with such a kick. So with that said, I am not sure if it was brandy or whiskey. Overall the drinks were fab.     The seared bar tuna was served with peanut and Korean bbq sauce. It was very tasteful and not dry at all. My head needed a minute to wrap itself around how good it was.     The double salmon roll was very good. The salmon was definitely fresh and put together very nicely. The other roll was  cucumber and avocado. I enjoyed this one because you were able to taste everything, including the seaweed wrap, which has been a while for me, so I know it was fresh.     The Korean fried chicken on a boa bun(rice flour), with a tomato, cilantro, and sweet pickle was delish! I really with I could have had another one!.. And will!     The rock shrimp was very good as well, with a nice spice to it. It wasn't dry and was very flavorful. This was also served very cute in a paper cone.     The sea bass kabob was cooked with perfection! The meat was juicy and flavorful with a sweet tasting glaze, and was not overwhelming with a seafood taste.     The shishito pepper were mild and either grilled or chard. Not sure if it had a taste of cayenne, but over all they were good. The edamame was good as well.     Being that this was an special event, I can not really being critical of the actual service we received, I will have to do that when I come back for a regular visit, but it was very good.  The ambiance was very nice and romantic, casual, and comfortable. That's all I can say!"}
{"text":"This place was good! My fiancé and I went here last night on a whim. We had no idea it was so...dressy inside, so we were a little underdressed. (Jeans don't seem appropriate here.) But hey, that's life. The atmosphere is romantic. Dim with bamboo features and a very zen waterfall wall. I had a delicious tequila cocktail called El Jefe, that I would order again in a second and my fiancé had a Flying Dog beer. He ordered two appetizers for his dinner (shrimp spring rolls and a pork stir fry type thing) and I had the crispy tofu and chopped salad. Everything was very tasty. My only gripe was I felt like it was pretty expensive for what we got... We spent $75 all told, and we didn't even hit the \"entree\" side of the page or have multiple drinks a piece. Still, I would definitely be back. This is definitely the kind of place I would go for a special occasion or the next time my folks are in town."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. However the Service was sloppy all around, people looked the part but didn't measure up. Served soup with no spoon, waited for refills way too long, twice food runners brought wrong food over.  Should be a little more seamless for the cost."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me out to dinner at Soba Lounge for my birthday last week!  We had reservations for 7 pm on a Thursday evening, and had an absolute hell of a time parking!  How does anybody live in this neighborhood?  It's maddening.  The lot next to Soba was full, and there's only one way in/out, so it was pretty much impossible to get out of after we realized it was full - don't even bother, just drive around until you find street parking somewhere.  Our disgruntled-ness quickly wore off when we stepped inside.  Dimly lit, sleekly decorated, and filled with a sense of Zen and calm, my boyfriend noted that it reminded him of the restaurants in Chicago.  High praise!  We followed our server upstairs, past a peaceful wall-waterfall, and to our elegant table.  There was a medium-size crowd at Soba that night, consisting oddly of mostly older people and businessmen - not many twenty somethings in sight!  That was a bit surprising, but fortunately the noise level was low, giving Soba a feeling of intimacy - great for a date!  Our server was friendly, perky, and quick to recommend her favorite dishes.  She was the kind of server who, if you wanted her to, would stop at your table to chat for a few minutes, but if you'd rather she was unobtrusive and quick, she could do that too.  I started with a cocktail, the Gin Blossom, and my boyfriend got something with Drambuie that isn't on the menu anymore.  I LOVED mine - it was purple!  It was very floral and sweet, perfect for me.  Just strong enough too - I sipped it throughout the whole meal.  We started with the grilled baby octopus, which actually was great!  The texture was meatier than we expected - I think we anticipated the rubbery, chewiness of calamari.  But it was great!  The legs (tentacles?) were lined with grill marks and the meat had a salty, savory taste.  And the aioli that lined the plate?  Creamy and delicious.  Next, we enjoyed the lobster maki with pistachios and mango - it was delicious and fresh, presented very simply.  A bit pricey for what you get, but we enjoyed it nonetheless.  For my entree, I had the sea scallops with BBQ pork, and it was pretty wonderful.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, and I mean PERFECTLY.  The pork underneath was flavorful and tender - a bit salty, but at least it wasn't bland!  The rice cake noodles were deliciously glutinous and chewy.  It was a good size portion as well - I couldn't quite finish it after the two appetizers we shared, so I had to take a bit home. Boyfriend got the pad thai, and I found it a little disappointing in that it was indistinguishable from takeout pad thai.  Good takeout, but still - it didn't seem heightened in any way.  Which is fine, I guess, but for $19?  Whoa.  No.  He was satisfied with it, but I was disappointed since it was a special occasion and his meal definitely wasn't of birthday caliber.  At least it was my birthday and not his!  I think generally the food here is very good, and the atmosphere is upscale and intimate.  I'd stick with the dishes that are complex and unique.  Don't go here and get the pad thai.  But you won't be disappointed by the exotic offerings!"}
{"text":"Finally went to this restaurant, now I understand the hype!  I loved what I had ordered.  The Thai corn chowder is awesome -so flavorful.  The flat bread with hummus - delicious (the hummus had a citrus taste to it).  The avocado maki roll was also great.  Service was excellent.  We sat outside on the balcony - beautiful and comfortable."}
{"text":"Best fancy dinner I've had in town, hands down.   The atmosphere was romantic, the staff was very friendly and attentive, and the food was done to near perfection. Other reviews have talked about a rude hostess, but the woman who seated us was friendly enough. Perhaps I got lucky because we went on a Sunday and it was a nearly empty restaurant?  I had the tandoori salmon and my friend had the bass. Both were very yummy, and though I often don't get desert the sorbet trio was a perfect ending to the meal. I'm always wary about going to such high priced places and leaving still hungry due to small portion sizes, but I was stuffed to the brim and we had left over calamari."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant and i went there as an undergrad and I felt really chic. It's a very stylish restaurant and has a great array of menu items without sacrificing quality. The food was really good and I would definitely come here again but probably for a special occasion. It makes for a really wonderful date.   I went a few years ago but I remember the lobster tacos sticking out - they were very tasty and I wish I could have gotten several plates of them."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service -- we sat on the second floor patio and it was well decorated. Temperature was cool with the awning but still received the warmth of the afternoon, so it was a nice balance. It was our server's second night on the job, but he did very well and was attentive to our table.  Cocktails -- we each had several different cocktails over the span of the night. My personal favorites were the Offer You Can't Refuse ($10) and the Bee Keeper ($11). Both were very drinkable and I could definitely have a few over dinner. I also tried the White Walker ($12) as any Game of Thrones fan would. I love smokey flavor and this had a great mezcal, but the jalapeno was a little too strong for my liking. It was great as a \"one and done\" cocktail. Definitely could not have more than one of these as it left a bit of a tingly sensation on your lips from the heat of the drink.   Appetizers -- the Rock Shrimp Tempura is DELICIOUS. I could order a couple plates of this and be completely satisfied for the night.   Entrees - The pad thai was so-so. I am partial to the Pad Thai at Nicky's Tai Kitchen, so it's hard for me to find a good runner up. The sauce was good, but I am also not used to having tofu in my pad thai so that threw me off a bit.   The Long Island Duck was very good. The Asian pear complimented very nicely and the sauce was amazing. Served with gnocchi, this was a great dish.   Overall was very pleased and will come back again."}
{"text":"What a lovely, intimate, upscale restaurant! A nice surprise by my boo on a Wednesday night was going to Soba for dinner. We didn't have reservations but there was some seating available and we opted to sit outside since the weather was gorgeous.  I have never been here before and was really impressed with the decor! The outside seating area was my favorite part of the whole dining experience. Comfortable chairs, lights strung across the ceiling, the most pleasant breeze and a view of the sky (which at the time was a mix of pinks and reds).   Boo and I split an appetizer (the mushroom, spinach dumplings) and the pad thai entree. Both were fantastic as was the service. Love it!"}
{"text":"I went to Soba for my birthday with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed every second. It was hard not to with the amazing decor (I kid you not, one entire wall is a water feature; it was insane). With the dark lighting I knew I was in for a fancy meal.  We ordered the rock shrimp tempura as an appetizer. It was very spicy, but I enjoyed it. Somehow the tempura batter stayed crispy after it had been tossed in the sauce.  We split a spicy tuna roll with the pad Thai. The sushi was fresh and bright. It was a great tuna roll! The pad Thai was also very yummy; the sauce was the perfect consistency that coated every noodle--it was just as pad Thai should be. I didn't enjoy the texture of the chicken that much, but that is probably just a personal preference. I wish I could've switched out the protein though!  The best part of our meal was the service. It was my birthday, and when we ordered the chocolate pretzel stack for dessert (very richly chocolately, loved the crunchy pretzel bits, but far too rich to finish) and it didn't arrive with a candle, our waitress went to get me one within seconds. It was that touch that really made the meal special."}
{"text":"Really solid food, and excellent service thanks to Bart, our extremely genial waiter. I've been to Soba twice before for entrees (thank you, Birthday Club!) and been satisfied, but tonight's sharing plates + maki dinner had me downright impressed. The shishito peppers are delicious, and a nice foil to richer, porkier dishes. The Chilean Sea Bass skewers were very nicely flavored, though we were disappointed to not be served the skin--it's the tastiest part! We also got the Korean fried chicken bao (Vietnamese style slider), and while the chicken was very authentic in its sticky sweet glaze and crispy coating, we felt the buns were missing some spice and acid...a little gochujang would have made them much more balanced.  We also ordered both the double maki rolls, and they were tasty although the tuna roll didn't seem to have much of the spicy mayo. We were also tempted into dessert...I usually take one look at the menu and think \"I could make that, and that, and that...\" but Soba's dessert menu is quite thoughtful and creative. We got the banana split and the pretzel stack, and while both were quite tasty (the miso caramel was especially interesting), neither was particularly remarkable (the raspberry ice cream of the night clashed with the banana and caramel, and the stack needed a bit more crunch to cream). If you're into desserts, I would highly recommend saving room at least for a peak, because it's rare to find a restaurant that puts such effort into the post-dinner menu.  I would be remiss if I didn't give a fuller commendation to Bart, who jovially kept our water glasses filled, offered recommendations, and ensured that everything was prepared to our liking (even going so far as to sub out the coffee-flavored ice cream on the split). He struck the magic balance of being there every time we looked for him but nowhere in sight when he was not needed. Soba is lucky to have him."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wonderful wait staff, and the food is good, but a little too much. I kept wanting chef Ramsey to walk in and make the dishes more simple.  The pork wrapped around sugar cane, simmered in banana leaves with lemon grass water was a bit too sweet. The soup's were dense and filled with so many ingredients, you couldn't enjoy, let alone identify, the flavors.  They give large portions, and don't skimp, but sometimes, less is more. The ribs were the saving grace, with the meat almost falling from the bone."}
{"text":"Dining solo so my review is somewhat biased because of a slight uneasy feeling doing so at this establishment.  Don't get me wrong.  I dine alone and have done so quite often throughout the many years.  My point is that I shouldn't feel uncomfortable while doing so and some establishments seem to go out of their way on this point.  I chose this restaurant as a recommendation by my hair stylist as a treat to myself after getting a great new coif.  I walked the several blocks from the salon to the restaurant because it was a nice evening weather-wise and I hadn't really explored Shadyside before so it was fun taking in the architecture of homes, shopping, and seeing other restaurants in the neighborhood I want to try.  Upon entering, I stood for a few moments more than necessary to be greeted.  I was asked if maybe I wanted to sit in the lounge area; I looked and opted for a table, instead.  I then waited a few more moments more than necessary when he returned before he made eye contact after searching for an open table.  All I'm saying is that I definitely felt second-rate at the host(ess) station, whether that was because I was alone, alone as a woman, because I didn't have a reservation, or maybe my new coif wasn't as great as I thought (ha!).  I don't know and didn't really care for the feeling.  I did manage to stay; however, to be escorted to the top floor patio that is open but covered.  It was an exquisite place to dine.  My server was pleasant but definitely reserved.  I ordered a glass of Riesling ($10), a fair price amongst restaurants.  I also ordered Thai corn chowder and pork lettuce wraps, each coming to the table separately.  The corn chowder was flavorful but the texture wasn't what I expected.  It was more of a thick puree than chunks of corn.  Though good, I'd order something else next time simply because of the texture.  The pork lettuce wraps were excellent and plentiful to make a dinner portion for one.  All totaled, the bill was $30 for the glass of wine, soup, and lettuce wraps, a fair price in such a beautiful setting.  All in all, I would come here again but definitely with my husband.  It's a great date venue but a little more hoity-toity and prissy dining solo (aka \"pretentious\") than I particularly cared for.  Thus, 4 stars vs 5 stars for the review."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere.  The food leaves you wanting more.    First time back in many years.  I won't rush back.  Cocktails were good but weak in alcohol.  First plate was steamed dumplings with squash.  The steamed dumpling was the consistency of a leather shoe.  The filling was barely apparent.    I shade a piece of the friend pork dumpling...which was better.  I also shared the fried tofu which was good.  Second course was salmon roll.   I asked for it third but it was placed at the same time with the incorrect third course.   It was delicious.   When the error was corrected, my third course was the Sichuan chicken which was so salty it was inedible.  My friendly server let me know that the manager tasted it and agreed....bizarre.   Nobody chose dessert.   I will probably not go back.   I can get good rolls in the strip for less.    The waiter was the only redeeming factor."}
{"text":"I've been to Soba Lounge before, three times before actually, and all three times I had a good meal, but my last visit was so unfortunately and unequivocally terrible that it felt necessary to share the details of our meal.   For appetizer, we had the kimchi pancakes, which were not fully cooked. They were doughy and sticky, and when we informed out waiter, he agreed with us that it was not fully cooked, but made no move to return the dish to the kitchen until we requested that it be at the very least warmed up to a degree in which it was actually edible.   I had the sea bass, which was mediocre and somehow different from the other wonderful times I had ordered this delightful dish - it lacked the explosively delicious flavors. The curry that was ordered was the worst - completely and wholly NOT recommended. The rice was tough (probably not fully cooked once again), and the spices were arbitrary to the chicken itself, as though they were thrown in after the chicken was already cooked.   Given the price of Soba dishes, the bill certainly took a plunge into our wallets, but sadly with no degree of satisfaction for our taste buds or stomachs."}
{"text":"Soba is another restaurant in the Big Burrito group's offerings and absolutely another hit. It's located in Shadyside, an area that I rarely venture out to for fear of destroying my car, but I will make the trek for Soba. And Mad Mex.  As others have noted, the restaurant is very intimate. Compared to Eleven, which is classy and upscale but rather casual (if that makes sense), Soba is definitely date night territory. In fact, my boyfriend took me on our first date to Soba followed by an awesome evening at Cirque de Soleil. What a night it was.  This restaurant is up to the standards of quality and service that all of Big Burrito's restaurants offer. The food is amazing, the drinks are tasty, and the staff are super friendly. The Asian Plum Sangria and the Bangkok Tea are my favorite drinks there, highly recommend them. The one called Offer You Can't Refuse - be careful. Tasty, but be careful.  As far as food, excepting one time we've always just ordered a round of different appetizers and spent the night sampling. I've never had anything I didn't like, and I in fact highly recommend the crispy tofu. Yum-my. Even if you think you don't like tofu, you feel so wrong about that stance once you've eaten theirs.  The only time we ordered entrees was on NYE. We engaged in their pre-fixe menu for the holiday. I can't remember what we had, but I do remember all of it being awesome. It was a really great way to spend NYE, avoiding any type of craziness and filling up on some good food."}
{"text":"I was recommended this restaurant by a friend a year ago and I loved it when I first went. It is dimly lit and has a very romantic ambiance. The seared tuna, made medium-rare, was warm and crunchy on the outside due to the sesame encrusted skin but still retained a nice, raw non-fishy tuna taste on the inside. The drinks are also fairly priced. Especially a year ago, if I remember correctly, it was around ~$65 for Moet Champagne which was very cheap so we ended up getting two which I guess helped the night go by easier. The lounge got busier and more vibrant as our Friday night went on at Soba Lounge. If I reviewed it last year, I would've given this restaurant five stars.  Impressed with my experience the first time, I went back again last Wednesday night. I still made a reservation on opentable but it was completely unnecessary since the restaurant was pretty empty. If that's the case I recommend you asking to be seated by the waterfall on the first floor. A bottle of Moet went up to $87 so I decided not to get it this time and moved straight to the food.  I began the meal this time with calamari, followed by the tuna again with the bronzini (sea bass) for myself and ended the meal with a light honeycrisp apple pudding cake dessert. I'm not quite sure what the sauce was for the calamari but it didn't go quite well with the oversized fried squid. They were not bite-sized and I've never had to cut calamari before. Even though the restaurant wasn't very busy, I was surprised the chef was still able to undercook the ginger rice accommodating the Tuna dish to an inedible level. The waiter apologized and don't get me wrong, there was great service, but I still ended up paying full fare for half a meal. For that I had to drop the restaurant down one star.  There's a parking lot available right next to the restaurant but spaces are limited. Street parking around the neighborhood shouldn't be too hard to find too."}
{"text":"Soba is great! The food is delicious, and sometimes (positively) surprising. For example, their mashed potatoes have an asian twist to them and are a little bit spicy! I like the atmosphere, interior and the service has always been great."}
{"text":"I can't stress how incredible the Big Burrito group is. They deserve prizes.  I came to Soba with two friends for the Oc Om Boc festival, and was pleased to order and eat the price-fixed ($35) four-course meal they offered. Delicious pho, egg rolls, spring rolls, duck confit, duck breast, noodles, beef and rice, fresh vegetables, and an incredible dessert of cake with a hint of banana (and a vanilla wafer).  The lights were turned low, there was a wall with running water streaming down from the top, and there was some contemporary playlist in the background playing all of your NPR favorites (David Gray, Radiohead). As an added bonus, the paper towels in the bathroom were EXCELLENT--I felt so guilty wiping my hands on them and throwing them away.  The menu is a bit pricey, but I don't think I'm experienced enough to judge its price vs. the food...I'm just a pretty broke college student who spends all of his expendable income on nice places like Soba."}
{"text":"I had a great night planned with my girlfriend at Soba for valentines, we had looked forward to dinner all week.  When we got there we got a couple of appetizers one being the steamed pork dumplings.  When they served them to us my girlfriend said they felt cold and when she cut them open it was completely raw.  When you feel as though you're going to an upscale restaurant you should know that they can at least cook the food properly, and while they did take the dumplings off the bill, the entire meal should have been comped.  We'll never be returning again!"}
{"text":"This was the last stop on the \"Brother Visits Ne'er Do Well Kid Sister and Treats Her to Meals\" tour.  We started with the Indonesian corn fritter wraps, which were delicious with the chili-soy dipping sauce.  The corn fritters should have either been a little smaller or the lettuce leaves a little bigger, however, because the combo to unwieldy to roll up and eat.  The seaweed salad was good, too.  My entree was the autumn vegetables and rice cake noodles--which I only realized was very similar to a pasta dish at Casbah after I took my first bite.  The dish at Casbah: maccheretto with white beans, wild mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, cheese and walnuts.  Soba's version: rice cake noodles with wild mushrooms, butternut squash, green beans, arugula and sunflower seed pesto.  The types of vegetables in Casbah and Soba's versions differ, but the pestos taste pretty much the same.  Rice cake noodles don't really soak up liquid, though, so Soba's version was drowning in sauce.  I probably would have enjoyed another entree more.  I guess I should have read the menu description more carefully, but didn't think Asian fusion (Soba) and Mediterranean (Casbah) were anything alike, so I didn't expect to get the same dish at both restaurants.  For dessert, we split the five spice apple tart with honey creme fraiche and crispy yam.  The tart was more honey creme fraiche with some apple bits on top; it was tasty but I would have liked more apple.  I enjoyed the atmosphere on a Sunday night, and our server was pleasant but didn't hover.  The food's delicious--just order carefully if you've dined at another Big Burrito restaurant not too long ago, to avoid getting a similar dish."}
{"text":"This was one of the best dinners I've ever had. A total surprise as frankly, I didn't think of Pittsburgh as a culinary Mecca. But two for two. Soba's ambiance is ecclectic and Asian avant-guard.   Nestled in a newly gentrified part of Pittsburgh and close to everything.  Entering the restaurant, we were ushered promptly through the modern multi-storied restaurant to a quiet part of the restaurant, where our very service-oriented wait staff was eager to make our night a memorable one.  We started with the spicy tuna maki which was a tasty melange of tuna, corn nuts, avocado and peppers.   My BF had a Thai Corn Chowder soup which was more like a succulent potage.  We then shared the chopped salad, an iceberg-based salad with coconut tempura crisps, cashews, mango, cucumber, daikon, papaya, avocado, and all drizzled with a spicy miso dressing.   This last concoction was heavenly.  For a pièce de résistance, my BF ordered the Alaskan Halibut, delicately cooked in a pomegranate-based sweet and sour sauce, and accompanied by the brussel sprouts and turnips with a butternut squash puree.  I had the Bronzini on lemon-grass broth, which the chef, upon request, fileted and removed bones and head, since it is  normally served whole.  This last concoction was absolutely amazing, with chopped buttercup squash, a slaw of apple and cashews, and drizzled with a lemongrass coconut sauce.  The dessert was their sorbet trio with the mango being the winner.    The entire evening was a wonderful concoction of flavors and Asian infusion.  A wonderful Argentine wine complimented the selections. Sorbet trio"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very beautiful. The sapce is good, services are excellent. However, the dishes are not as I expected. Pat Thai is salty, and Korean Baos Bun is not tasty.   I just came to try the foods before my big groups come. It seems I have to choose other place"}
{"text":"This is a really nice place, tucked into a fantastic little block on Ellsworth in Shadyside. The cocktails and food are very good. They always have a few great beers on tap too if that's your thing. You can get sushi, which I presume comes from Umi upstairs.  I'd give it 5 stars, but I think the Soba restaurant itself lacks ambiance. It's kind of weirdly quiet and too loud at the same time. If you go as a couple, you inevitably get a table uncomfortably close to large loud tables on either side. Feels like they're cramming you in like the one \"nice\" restaurant in a college town on Valentine's day. Last time after we saw where we were seated, we just went to the bar, which was a lot nicer and serves the same food.  Overall, Soba is a great place. Good food and drink. Just sit in the bar area."}
{"text":"Brooklyn sorachi ace ale on tap was excellent. We had the farmers feast tasting menu (4 course, $35 plus wine pairing $20, great value). All locally sourced ingredients. Unexpected dishes for a pan Asian restaurant.  1st Course Smoke corn chowder with corn tempura, thyme, and smoked bacon Green bean tempura with a hot pepper aioli and sweet tsume  Corn and zucchini cupcake with tomato ponzu  2nd Course White tuna aka escolar fresh cherries and cucumber. Bonito, pine nut brittle, and Thai basil oil in cucumber water  3rd Course Lamb saddle wih local vegetables :corn, zucchini, heirloom tomatoes. Braised lamb leg and a black garlic sauce  4th Course Sweet corn cake with black berry jam a brown sugar streusal marinated peaches and a popcorn whip cream  Service at bar impeccable (Erica mixed a mean Pimm's cup, and knew the menu inside and out)"}
{"text":"The food is really good here, I always get the calamari! I would stay away from the lobster rolls though.  The atmosphere is really awesome, I usually like to sit by the bar... usually in one of the comfy couch/chairs. The lighting sets the mood, and they have a TV which is good for when you want to keep an eye on the game but not be completely absorbed with it.  They make awesome drinks, and the service is pretty good.   Great place to bring a date or come with a buddy to get a drink and an appetizer before heading out on the town."}
{"text":"The tuna is so amazing. I am obsessed. The Kim chi side is a bit spicy for my tastes so I get it on the side. The Korean BBQ sauce is so good. A bit sweet and tangy. The tuna is always cooked to perfection and never chewy or fishy. Tastes like a steak. So, in other words, perfect. Worth the price.   The happy hour is great, too. The drinks never fail. The calamari appetizer is so good. Lightly breaded, right amount of saltiness, and the dipping sauces are wonderful.   I only go on special occasions, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If you want a classy evening with great food, creative drinks and a very nice interior, you can do far, far worse than Soba.  First, it's much larger than you might think at first - with a restaurant proper and bar / lounge area to the side. Your first decision will be whether to dine in the restaurant area or go for a more casual (but comfortable) chat near the bar. Either are great options and the bar / lounge area can be particularly awesome for a big group. I've been there with 20(!) people and we had enough room and felt very comfortable. One downside (and the reason this review is a four star, rather than a five star, review is the service in this area. When I have been there, there has only been one server allocated to the bar area, even when there were over 30 people present! This is a seriously tough person-to-server ratio and we were waiting about 20 minutes to catch their attention and place new drink orders. With this kind of ratio, you can also rule-out someone spotting that you're drink is finished and you might want a top-up. If you do visit the bar, try the lobster tacos - delicious!  In the restaurant area itself, you can have a classy meal with very attentive service (which makes the lounge experience all the more puzzling). There is an impressive drinks menu and the food was uniformly excellent. This would be a very good location for a date or a celebratory meal.  So overall, come here for a very nice meal or a casual hang-out in the lounge or bar area. Prepare to be patient if you do sit in the lounge area as you might be waiting a while for a drink, but as there aren't many place that can support the numbers that Soba allows, it might be a price worth paying."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and am a huge fan. Asian fusion places are always tricky to master, but Soba has never failed to impress me. The main courses and desserts are delicious, beautiful, and have a nice spin on them without being too exotic or extreme. I can see both an Asian and Western flair in a variety of dishes, which is right up my ally. However, the two occasions I've been there, I find that the appetizers aren't as great as the main courses. The lobster tacos and the dumplings were bland and weren't seasoned well. I could definitely see having a bit more salt on the tacos and less of the mayo as a couple improvements, but the tacos were still delicious. The dumplings didn't have any taste and the dumpling itself was much too starchy than I was used to, but this is just a personal preference. Overall, I can definitely say that Soba has great main dishes and desserts and I'm hoping I can find that golden appetizer next time I come here."}
{"text":"Call me old fashioned, but I like actual tables and chairs. I also more than an airplane-rows sized leg room in bet between different parties of people.  Leaving the weird ottoman seating and ikea end-tables behind, the food was not bad and service was quick. The sushi was bland but the crab spring rolls were amazing."}
{"text":"We went to Soba for a belated birthday celebration and we all overall enjoyed it but there were a couple things we didn't like. If you have a reservation for 5pm, they do not open their doors until 5pm so be prepared to wait outside beforehand. The entrees weren't as good as the appetizers as most of the appetizers were really deliciously exceptional. The edamame hummus was wonderful. It was served with taro chips which were excellent but they don't give you enough chips for the amount of hummus they give you and you will be charged $2 if you ask for more chips, which I think is a bit much, especially when you order as much as we did (over $200). My sister didn't like the $26 hanger steak which she said was chewy and sent it back. They took the steak off the bill but didn't comp her for the $19 meal she ordered instead. It was an inconvenience that she had to order another meal and the least they could do was comp it. They didn't do anything special for my birthday so be aware of this if you are celebrating something nice. There are many other establishments I've been to that give you dessert, sing to you or throw you something special to celebrate your day, this is not the place for that. My boyfriend ordered the duck ramen $22 and it wasn't good at all..AT ALL, would not recommend it! He ate most of it but the taste was off as the duck didn't compliment the ramen noodles or the seasonings they added to it, which all sat in a non appetizing soupy broth. The corn chowder $9 with crab was just ok... crab in a creamy corn sauce, not the most appetizing of combinations. The chirashi bowl $16 was good, a big bowl of sushi parts. There was a raw quail egg in it which made the dish a bit runny but the fish and rice was good and I really liked the seaweed strips added to it, though I wouldn't get it again. I would prefer a sushi roll as compared to rice with raw fish thrown atop of it. The spicy tuna maki roll $14 was good, definitely a cut above regular sushi. My mom and sister got vegetarian and chicken/shrimp pad thai $17/$21 which was a big serving and they enjoyed. I tried the noodles, they were good, not great. The steamed squash dumplings $10 were OUT OF THIS WORLD! Definitely would order those again. For my main dish, I ordered a salad $11 and sea bass satay, both extraordinarily great!  I'm glad I ordered 2 small plates compared to an entree which isn't their strong suit. The szechuan chicken appetizer $10 no one was crazy about. It was fried, a lot of curry, and dry peppers and green onions. It didn't taste like chicken at all and had the consistency of dog treats. My dad got the vegetarian bi bim bap $21 and really enjoyed it. Overall, the service was good and small plates were delicious but the entrees fell short. I would come back but for small plates only."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants. Has gone through a couple of face lifts with the most recent being the best. The bar side, where I go almost every time is much more comfortable and cooler than before.   The drinks. I think they have a pretty decent cocktail and wine list. They are very well made and although expensive, pretty generous. Really like Laura the bartender. She is solid. The beers on tap are minimal and pretty safe bets with a few more to chose from by the bottle, but not a beer snob Mecca.   The food. I really enjoy places that spotlight small plates allowing you to try many things. I can't remember a small plate I did not like and can remember a few I wish would come back.....uhhh soft shells...  Usuall don't go for an entree but my wife and I split the filet one unadventurous night and it was delicious and very cleverly done.   It is expensive but very high quality and It's a great place to come alone, as a couple or a group. One of BB's gems."}
{"text":"Consistently outstanding and creative food served professionally in a great and even varied ambiance. What more could you ask for? Oh yes, excellent wine list and drinks."}
{"text":"excellent!!!  requested a private table for our anniversarry which we actually got !! started at the lounge bar since we arrived 30 min early with a White walker , very different , spicy but great.  We had bao buns and shishito peppers for an appetizer , tea leaf salad then moved to our main courses of pan tai and korean fried chicken.  It was all excellent !  for desert we split a bannana split.  In all with 3 glasses of wine and two cocktails added the total bill was $138 .  Which i thought was a bargain .  Will most definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Over the years, I've tried a number of items on Soba's menu. Items I've enjoyed: calamari, lobster tacos, double salmon roll, white lychee sangria, hazelnut crunch bar. (A special shout-out to the lobster tacos. They are great. I especially love the peas in them.) Items I haven't enjoyed: pad thai, green mountain curry, lobster roll. Items that were just okay: long island duck, spicy pork lettuce wraps, banh mi bao buns, spicy tuna roll. One thing that seems to be consistent is the long wait time for your food to arrive. Once when I came for dinner, I recall having to wait 55 minutes for the food to come out. With interesting menu options, Soba is worth a try if you haven't been here before, but be careful with what you order and be prepared to wait a while for your food.   Taste | 3 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 3 OVERALL | 3.5"}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of Asian fusion restaurants. To me, most of the time this ends up being Asian dishes that are made worse rather than interesting but still delicious.  Soba defies this stereotype. They have some interesting dishes but almost everything I've tried is pretty solid.  My favorite is the Miso Black Cod. The ssam jang (miso type) flavor is pervasive throughout the dish and makes the savory component complex and interesting in every bite. A slightly different take on the Nobu version, including some complements that I think elevate the dish even more. The rice cake is soft but chewy, and the black cod, the star of the dish is tender, flaky, and (dare I say it) moist. The pine nuts add a little bit of crunchy buttery and somewhat sweet taste.  Another favorite among my friends is the Rock Shrimp tempura. This is a dish that is featured in many menus, but Soba executes it so well: lightly fried and paired with a slightly sweet, slightly spicy aioli. Yum.  Their cocktails are generally strong (minus perhaps the sangrias which are just sweet but yummy), their decor is elegant, and their service is generally spot on. There's a reason that this is (and will continue to be) one of my most visited places in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Food is very good, not outstanding and they are  pretentious. They seem to be very New York like in terms of seating trendy looking people in the front and parking the Bentley's ou front with lots of orange cones.   One of the six of us got the wrong dish, but she ate it. Turns out to have been the best dish."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night with reservations. The restaurant ambience is great. I started off with a lychee sangria that was light and refreshing with hints of lychee and lemon.  We had the rock shrimp tempura and Korean fried chicken bao buns. The shrimp tempura portion was huge and definitely sharable. It was nice and crispy and the sauce was a typical bang bang shrimp sauce. I had never had bao buns before and was so excited to try them! The buns were nice and soft and the fried chicken was so good. Definitely could have had another one.   We then shared the double salmon roll and the spicy tuna roll. For sushi, the pieces are pretty big. The double salmon roll had SO MUCH salmon in each piece. The spicy tuna roll also was very fresh fish.   Finally for dessert, we had the Thai ginger creme brûlée. The ginger and thai flavors were a little overpowering for my liking but still a well made desert. Overall, would definitely come back to Soba! Every item we had was prepared well and tasted great. Just a bit on the pricier side."}
{"text":"I enjoyed pat tai smelling exotic scents and fried cuttle under the golden candle light. Taste was good and I felt romantic. It was a little expensive but worth it.   There was a nice bar also even though I didn't drink anything. When I have another chance to visit there, I will treat myself cocktail filling beautiful glass with its vivid color.  You would rather make a reservation to get comfortable seat. Be careful about extra ordinary scents that can be unbearable to someone though I loved it."}
{"text":"I had read about Soba in Pittsburgh Magazine. I was intrigued when I saw that Soba was Numbero Uno according to a recent reader's poll. And doubly impressed that it was listed as one of the magazine's top 25 restaurants in the city. With a build up like that, I was very excited to dine here.   We had an early evening reservation. The exterior is described as 3 story Victorian. Looked like a homely dump to me. Inside was a very different story. Sleek and modern, with a Zen like garden feel, we were excited as little kids to be lead to table on the 3rd floor near the bar area. I thought the atmosphere was tranquil and very romantic. I started with the thai corn chowder with crab meat. I was taken aback by the color, a sort of dreary gary/mustard. But it was very delicious, very spicy. My BBF had a salad that was very flavorful with chicken and fresh spring greens. We were also served an appetizer with cucumber and pita chips.   For dinner, we had the filet mignon and the seafood hot pot. The filet was extremely thick and served with a nice vegetable mixture and potatoes.  The flavor was amazing.  The seafood looked delicious, I sampled the shrimp and they were very well seasoned.   Dessert was also just as amazing. We shared the vanilla-roasted Asian pear served with a gingerbread biscuit, Asian pear sorbet and sabayon. We also shared a chai spiced creme caramel flan. It was so yummy with pumpkin seed brittle and vanilla chantilly.   All in all a very special evening. Everything was wonderfully presented and service was very good.  I have to agree with the readers of Pittsburgh mag."}
{"text":"Food ordered:  Drinks - Rhubarb Fizz, Flying Dog Porter Appetizers - Potstickers and Lettuce Wraps Entrees - Dolsot Bi Bim Bap and Vietnamese Beef Noodles  For $12, the Rhubarb FIzz was underwhelming, over-iced, overly bittered. Flying Dog Porter is a great beer. The Potstickers were ok, but tiny, while the Lettuce Wraps were the star of the entire dinner. Vietnamese Beef Noodles were bland and flavorless. The menu lists them as including jalapeno, but there was no heat whatsoever. As for the Bi Bim Bap, I've had this a few times at Korean restaurants, and it was very... different. They essentially took the appetizers and side dishes and tossed them in the pot. The kim chi and pickled shiitake just didn't belong in the dish, and brought a very off flavor to the entire things. It took a full dousing of the goju jang for the dish to be eatable. Very very disappointing.  Service was ok. They asked how the meal was too many times, yet after 15 minutes I had to flag down a waiter just for them to take my card so we could pay and leave.  It was my wife's birthday, and we took advantage of Big Burrito's GREAT free entree promotion, but even with $23 worth of Vietnamese Beef Noodles taken off the check, I still felt completely ripped off paying $80 for the rest of the meal and a tip. I'd much rather go to Noodlehead and pay $20 for a much better meal next time."}
{"text":"I'd prob give Soba 3.5 stars if I could. We didn't want to drive in the snow so walked over to Soba on a Friday night and actually made reservations just an hour before (we prob won't get away with that on a non-stormy night). After a blast of warm air I was welcomed into this dark, cozy and seductive venue. We were led up to the top level and settled in. I ordered a Sapporo, calamari and tuna. Beer always hits the spot for me. Calamari was delicious with a nice mayo sauce with a squirt of lime. The tuna was tender! My butter knife cut into it so easily. The side of kimchi was just okay and the abundance of hot sauce sauce was to much for me. Fried rice went well with everything and balanced the tuna and sauce out. We then ordered the coconut cashew brownie which was delicious too as suggested by the waitress. The portions were large imho and while the service was fantastic I just thought the food was priced a tad high for what was offered. Seems like Soba would be nice for a special occasion or just to have a nice dinner though."}
{"text":"I was here to bring in the year 2015, and it was a memorable experience. First, the calamari appetizer I ordered was great! And the vibe there is so chill with such a modern layout. The service is also wonderful. You can either do open seating in the really nice bar area, or you can be seated in the dining portion of the restaurant. It's a cool place to hangout with your friends, though I remember some things on the menu being a little pricey. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I think Soba has one of the best/coolest atmospheres of any restaurant in Pittsburgh.  My first experience at Soba I did the tasting menu (I can't remember most of the courses, but I know I loved it)...I would do it again in a heart beat! My second experience, I ordered the Tandoori grilled Scottish Salmon as my main course and it was fantastic! I normally fill up on appetizers and my main meal and don't have room for dessert, but this time I decided to skip the appetizer and get a dessert instead, excellent decision! I would recommend any of their desserts (we ordered the chocolate pretzel stack and we agreed it was in the top desserts of all time).  Will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"By far the best meal I had during my four night stay in PIT.  Dinner kicked off with some ridiculously good Pork Belly Buns.  Sandwiched in the folded Chinese steamed bun were fresh cilantro, two flavorful, tender slices of pork belly, and a slathering of  hoisin BBQ sauce that was both tangy and savory.  If you consider these the Asian version of a White Castle slider, then go ahead and put me down for a Crave Case.  For my entree I had the Chili-Miso Black Cod.  Our waitress mentioned this was a fairly new addition to the menu, and, from what my stomach tells me, it's going to be on that menu for quite some time.  The black cod was delicate and delicious.  The rice cake noodles were like an Asian-style gnocchi, and their slight firmness provided a nice textural change to the black cod.  The sauce itself was flavorful, only slightly spicy, and included little shreds of pork and pine nuts to add to the flavor profile.  Dinner ended well with the Frozen Cashew Terrine.  The layers of chocolate ganache and candied cashews balanced well with the mango and raspberry coulis.    The interior itself was dimly lit and had a modern Asian vibe.  The wait staff was also very friendly and made some great recommendations.  If I'm ever back in PIT, Soba immediately jumps to number one on my dinner list."}
{"text":"pretty good food, fantastic atmosphere, slightly overpriced, but not unreasonable for the quality and atmosphere"}
{"text":"I have been going to Soba for the past 3 years on my birthday.  It is by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  It all comes together so beautifully at Soba.  When you walk in you really feel important.  Your table feels intimate, your server is interested in you, and most importantly the food is amazing!          On my last birthday in June it probably was my best experience yet.  We had reservations for right when they opened because we were going to the Pirate game right after.  We were the first ones there.  It was hot out but we asked to sit outside because we had never done that here before.  I loved it outside but it was probably a little to hot for us.  We could have gone back inside but we decided to stay out and just drink some cold water.         One thing about nice restaurants are that if you're really hungry you need to get a appetizer.  Usually the main dish isn't big enough.  That's one thing I have learned and I made sure to get an appetizer here.  I got the Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps.  They came out with some lettuce but a ton of meat!  It was great!  It was by far the best lettuce wraps I've ever had.  We needed more lettuce to eat it all.  It was so juicy, great spices, and refreshing.         The wraps were really filling.  Started second guessing my tip there about ordering an appetizer but I'm still glad that I did.  For my main dish I ordered Tandoori seared Scottish salmon.  Every time I come to Soba the menu is nice and challenging for me.  It's not like going to a chain restaurant and you already know what to expect and what you are going to order.  At Soba I like to read through the menu and see what I might like.  Then you have to read what comes with the rest of the dinner.  I usually take a little risk.  I like Salmon but I'm not sure if I will like everything that goes with the dish.  This has happened before to me at Soba.  \"lentils, green beans, fennel-orange salad, coriander raita, orange oi\"?  Will all of that work well with my Salmon?  I ordered it not sure if I would like it but the small risk turned out to be a big reward! This was one of the best plates that I have ever had.  It was so good.  The Salmon was cooked perfectly and all the other sides on the dish worked together so well.         They never disappoint me here.  Each time I come here it just keeps getting better and better!  I always recommend this place to my friends when they are looking to take out their love one to a special dinner.   Soba will not disappoint you!"}
{"text":"I came to Soba with some friends for a late dinner on a Saturday evening. This is more of an upscale joint, but you definitely don't have to \"dress up.\" The ambiance was romantic and very dim lit. The place seemed pretty massive as there were several large rooms to dine as well as a lounge/bar area.   The menu had pretty basic Asian options. Nothing really stood out as unique in any way. I ordered the Pad Thai and my girlfriend got the Lettuce Wraps. The Pad Thai had a lot of flavor but lacked spice. I also think you should get the option to select chicken, shrimp, or tofu rather than mixing all three. I'm not a big fan of tofu and would have much rather had more chicken or shrimp. It was very tofu heavy. The portions of food were very generous. The lettuce for the wraps was more like a salad and didn't really allow you to create individual wraps with the leaves. However, the fried rice and pork filling for the lettuce wraps was fantastic! It had the perfect amount of spice and the rice was fried perfectly to add a little bit of crunchy texture. I could have eaten an entire bowl of that stuff. All in all it was a bit overpriced for simple Asian cuisine, but that's what you can expect in Shady Side. It wasn't bad by any means, but they didn't give me much of a reason to return."}
{"text":"I love, love, love their pad thai! My boyfriend had bi bam bap which he loved as well. We shared the tuna tartar for an appetizer then finished with the chocolate pretzel stack! All in all, it was a delicious meal which is why I give it 4 stars.   The service was good, but nothing out of this world.   Unfortunately due to its ambiance and set up, our table was next to an obnoxiously loud table which caused us to not hang out and drink anymore cocktails. A little more space between tables would be nice, but it's not stoping me from going back.  Well done, Big Burrito!"}
{"text":"I've been to Soba a couple times now, and both times the food has been quite amazing.  I got a ramen dish last time that was amazingly spicy - in a good, sinus-clearing, make-you-think-about-what-you-just-done-boy sort of way.  The interior decor is quite beautiful and relaxing and swank. Presentation is quite nice too (well, soup can only get so pretty). I found the wait staff to be a little on the smug and unfriendly side, though. It isn't very clear how they separate the bar service from the seated tables, or where you're supposed to sit down, or how their whole system works. None of the staff seemed overly ambitious or excited to invite some new customers in.  I couldn't tell if they just are unhappy in their jobs or if they think they're top shit and should treat their clients like they don't belong, or what the deal was.  Perhaps it was just one experience. I'll be back to try it again - because the food is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is A-ok, so to speak. First, the positives: +really solid food- I wouldn't say anything is \"amazing\" or \"inspired\"- but it is high quality and delicious.  + great cocktails  +fantastic ambiance no matter where you are.  Cons: - I wouldn't call this a con, but this is in a place that I'm just \"dying to go to\"- i've never walked away unhappy but I've never thought man I really want to go to soba tonight. Likewise I wouldn't put it on a list of must do restaurants in Pittsburgh - it's over priced - can get a wee bit crowded and as noted in other reviews, parking is a bit tough.  Over all if you live in Pittsburgh, or you visit a lot, this place is definitely worth a try for the variety. However if you're only visiting, I would say find something more unique."}
{"text":"It is difficult to deliver bad news to anyone--delivering it to your best friend is even tougher--and delivering news that will make your best friend think you are a d__k is the worst.  That would be my discussion last night regarding a job interview.  At times like these, it's best to do it over a good meal.  It makes everything more, well, civilized.  Went to Soba at the recommendation of a friend from San Diego.  Soba is a very upscale hipster restaurant that could hold it's own in any city in America.  I had the mussels appetizer for dinner--it's a fairly substantial bowl with about 20 black-lipped mussels in a green curry (?) sauce with dried (small) soba noodles and some yummy vegetables.  Can't say enough good things.  Oh, and it was $9.  Can't beat that, can you?"}
{"text":"Ambiance was perfect for a date night. Not too loud not too quiet. Our waitress was nice and very helpful in suggesting appetizers and cocktails. \"Offer you can't refuse\" cocktail was delicious!  Food was great too but I'm giving Soba 4 stars because nothing was super memorable. I'll definitely go back, but not because I'm craving something I ate."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here since I first moved to Pittsburgh, but I never gotten a chance. Until I went to Yelp's event and Soba was serving kabobs, ooh I then told myself I am coming here for my birthday. I joined the big burrito membership so I can receive a free meal for my birthday, but I never did :-( Anyway, I still went to Soba for dinner. I had their Long Island duck, boy it was delicious. My favorite meat is duck, so I have have a lot of ducks. Soba's duck is more like a four stars for me. However, my experience makes me give them a five stars. We had a party of three and we waited a very looooong time for our entree to come out. Everyone else had their food but us. So the manager came out and apologized for any inconvenience, and he asked us if we need anything. I jokingly said free wine, and he really did bring me a glass of wine. My sister then told him that it is my birthday but I never received the free meal, if I can have dessert for free. He really let me pick a dessert for free. I got the dark chocolate Maki, it was soooo good :-) This shows that they really care about customer satisfication. I will definitely come back for some special occasion."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, a little too dark but still very very pretty and if that's all I was rating, it would be 5 star. However, I was unimpressed with dinner. The Korean ribs as appetizer were stale, NOT fresh by any means and overcooked. The tandoori salmon sounded and looked wonderful when it arrived and the salmon was cooked medium-rare, but I wasn't a fan of the overall dish and had to ask for lime, hot sauce, salt to be able to eat my meal. I was really hoping I would be blown away but unfortunately, I was not. However, others ordered different dishes which appeared delicious so maybe just don't order the Korean ribs or the salmon."}
{"text":"Spring Soba Noodle Salad is always so tasty and fresh. The atmosphere is relaxing with a lovely decor. Staff friendly and seem to enjoy working there."}
{"text":"I am reserving the fifth star for when we return on our own dime and order from the menu.   Went here for an alumni event with my husband.  There was open bar as well as passed hors devours.  Then they had a buffet station for dinner and dessert.   Soba outdid itself.  We were about an hour late to the event, but they were still serving some hors devours.  I was able to sample a miso black cod bite in a Chinese soup spoon which was a delicious bite and perfectly cooked.  I also had a glass of Prosseco that my husband enjoyed as well.   Then the dinner service began, which included chili garlic mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, seared ahi tuna with korean bbq sauce, and filet mignon with a delicious sauce that I can't remember the name of.   The food was phenomenal.  The tuna and filet mignon were both stellar and cooked to rare perfection. I also enjoyed a Last Word cocktail with dinner which was perfectly balanced and delicious.   For dessert they brought out their chocolate pretzel stack which was delicious and so wonderful with a salty and sweet combination.  They also had what tasted like small lemon tart, but I can't find it on the menu.   Overall I can't wait to return!  The service, food, and atmosphere where all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went to Soba for an anniversary dinner since we wanted to try something new and trendy. The interior (which I hear was renovated) was just that - NYC style trendy and the ambience was romantic. I had requested a seat overlooking the waterfall when I made the reservation which they said they could accommodate on the mezzanine but when we got there, they said it was closed. So we sat in the side room - not a huge deal.  We had the Korean BBQ appetizer, which was DELICIOUS! It felt kind of funny eating with my hands whilst in such a nice restaurant wearing a pretty dress, but I would totally get these again. *mouth waters*  For entrees I got the chicken ramen soup bowl which had a lot of chicken in it (pleasant surprise!) and was nice and hot. I added a little of the hot chutneys to it :) BF got the bim bam bop which he said was so-so. He asked for the egg on the side, but they plopped it in the middle. I'll have to say the service was so-so.  Nice for a special occasion and with 2 $10 off entree holiday coupons it didn't break the bank."}
{"text":"I've never been to Soba to eat a proper dinner. Only for drinks in their old bar. I remember it being tiny and pretty unremarkable. But now... wow! It's really a beautiful space. They must have replaced the lounge and the drink menu... because now it's memorable!  We were sitting there enjoying the open air windows looking onto the street, as the slight summer breeze rolled in, trying to figure out if this was an unused space or a new building they bought. Either way, the expansion is incredible!   I truly enjoyed sitting in the lounge sipping on some pretty phenomenal cocktails. I think sometimes I just assume Meat and Potatoes and Acacia are going to be the joints were I'm going to enjoy a stellar cocktail and that's it. But how narrow minded of me? I should be equal opportunity cocktail, right?!   I loved the Docksider (silver rum, aperol, agave nectar, grapefruit bitters, lemon, basil). I'm super into any cocktail with grapefruit, because that equals refreshing to me, and less sweet. But what blew me away was the Rebellion (beet infused wigle whiskey, luxardo maraschino). I love beets, so if you don't, this may not be the drink for you... BUT I thought it had a light beet taste with just the right amount of whiskey. And those maraschino cherries. Geez. I could eat gallons of them!  We also sampled some grub from the menu. The spicy noodles were very good, with just the right amount of spice to make my noose run (a sign of good spice). I could have used a touch more veggies, as the mushrooms were very good, but I find noodle dishes never have enough veggies in them. I thought the pork rolls were okay as well as the calamari, but really dug the yellowtail sashimi. Fresh and delicious. Like it should be!   I want to try every single drink. So let's begin..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I do not normally take the time out of my busy day to write reviews for restaurants that I check in at. However, I felt particularly compelled to take 15 minutes to discuss Soba Lounge with the E-universe. Put simply, the food is amazing. I went with a group of friends and we all decided to splurge on a good meal. The end result was we still found ourselves talking about this meal the next morning.   I have never tasted anything quite like the wagyu beef buns and highly recommend them. The combination of wagyu beef and flavorful kimchi, surrounded by a soft, delicate bun rivaled the best cheeseburger I've had in my life. For entree I went for the tandoori grilled salmon and this also did not disappoint. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was well complimented by a tangy yogurt sauce.   The ambiance is an upscale, dimly lit presentation, perfect for a romantic date or a couples outing. The service was friendly and fairly timely.   I look forward to the next time I am back in Pittsburgh area and can return, as the quality of the food is well worth the higher price-tag, and the menu provides adequate diversity."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Soba yet?  Well, let me remedy this oversight directly.  WIth this review I have now completed a clean sweep of all big burrito restaurants and I believe have not give one less than four stars.  This is a testament to this talented restaurant group which recently gained national attention by being named a semi-finalist by James Beard foundation for restaurater of the year.  That's it Pittsburgh we are getting more and more attention with the national food scene.  So, I've been here a million times (well, not literally) and was here last on Wednesday for business prior to the Pitt game with Mike and G. W. (not our former president...he hates asian fusion).  The space is beautiful and I spend most of time at the bar where they serve the full menu.  Howeve, a couple tidbits on the dining room.  It's three levels with a bar on the first and third level I believe an also a deck for al fresca' dining.  The first level is beautiful earthy tones, white linens and really comfortable chairs with some bench seating on the sides and four tops scattered about.  The ceilings are very high and there is a staircase in the middle of the room.  The top floor has very nice wood floors and a small wood bar.  The lighting is intimate and flattering.  The bar itself is pretty large with bench seating on the sides and nice comfy leather chairs for lounging.  I believe the doors open up to the sidewalk in the summer.  The service is always adequate, but not necessarily friendly I'd say. I usually get this bald fellow who is nice enough, but probably wouldn't engage in conversation if I was by myself.  One small complaint is that they tend to keep the bar really dark, which I like if I'm trying to hide in the corners while I drink away my concerns, but if I'm on a date I'd prefer a little more light.  The menu seems to me to not change that frequently and I rarely hear them offer features not already on the menu.  I guess it's because I've been here so often, but I wish they had more options.  We started Wednesday with korean barbecue ribs, chicken spring rolls and calamari.  The barbecue ribs were probably the best thing I had there all night.  They were well seasoned, fall off the bone and a healthy portion for only $9.  The chicken spring rolls were forgettable and the calamari was just \"ok\".  It was served lightly breaded, but lacked any real flavor.  We all drank relatively reasonably priced wine for under $10 a glass.  G. W. and I ordered the seared rare tuna, which is a very healthy portion of fresh quick seared good quality tuna with a sesame seed coating.  It's served with house made kim chi (really spicy) and ginger fried rice.  It's a safe choice and probably the most popular entree on the menu.  Mike had the seafood hot pot, and I think he was the winner with best entree' choice.  It was a delicious curry broth served with rice on the side overflowing with mussels (fresh), scallops (cooked perfectly) shrimp and I thinkI may have even have tasted sausage.  We skipped dessert.  This is a good place for some drinks and even a nice meal, especially if you don't come here often.  Congrat's again big burrito group for the James Beard nom."}
{"text":"The ambiance is perfection. However, I enjoy excellent food, timely service, and well balanced cocktails. If you prefer outstanding decor over all other elements listed. Then I'm sure you will enjoy your experience. I can only hope you trust and find my review helpful.   I accidentally ordered delivery from here after spending a long night working. It was horrible. The fish was tough and the other dish was simply inedible. This place is far too expensive to be serving food poorly prepared."}
{"text":"If you are like me, and adore espresso martini's, you must check out Soba on Ellsworth Avenue! The martini is made of chilled espresso, vanilla vodka and Kahlua coffee liqueur.   By far the best espresso martini in the city!  They also have an excellent food menu for both the bar and restaurant.  They have happy hour specials and the bar is always filled with a great crowd!  Soba is affiliated with the Big Burrito chain, along with Eleven, Kaya, Casbah and Umi: all of which are excellent restaurants!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service okay. A bit expensive for the quality of food served. Thai corn soup jumbo crab??? Good lucking finding a piece of crab meat.  Pad Thai at a fusion place? Not good at all...Better go to a real thai restaurant for pad Thai. Tandoori Salmon was average. I still don't understand why they served their fancy cream soda warm.  A cup given with no ice and a bottle of soda?  Why weren't their any ice in the glass? Who drinks sodas at room temperature. This restaurant maybe was trying to be too fancy and forgot the basics of ICE.  Maybe it is really just me who prefer cold sodas. Overall it is okay, but not justified by the price."}
{"text":"Overrated.  Completely overrated.  After reading all the rave reviews and hearing about how amazing SOBA was, I went there last night with two companions.  We started off with an order of calamari and tuna tartar.  What came out even before our appetizers was a complementary cucumber salad (it appeared that every table got it).  I found the flavor of the cucumber salad the best part of dinner.  The cool cucumbers were complemented with a slightly spicy sauce, which were served with slices of pita bread.  Even though our waiter went on about how the calamari was different than other restaurants, it was strikingly similar to the overly breaded calamari at the Cheesecake Factory.  It wasn't heavily seasoned, and most of the flavor came from the garlic sauce and freshly squeezed lime juice.  I preferred the tuna tartar over the calamari, as the the flavors melded well together with just the right amount of bite from citrus notes.  These were served with house made potato chips, which were sliced thin and fried golden with just the right amount of crunch.  For entrees, my companions ordered our server's #1 and #2 recommendations of seared rare tuna and boneless pork chop, and I ordered the wok seared sea scallops, since I've been having a craving for large plump sea scallops for some time.  One companion asked a rhetorical question of why everything that is labeled as \"Asian fusion\" or \"exotic\" has to be spicy, which we could not answer.  His seared rare tuna was a tuna steak cooked rare topped with the Korean \"gochujang\" mellowed out with some soy and probably sugar (that's where the fusion plays in, instead of kiwi or pear juice).  He mentioned that he liked the ginger fried rice, even though the rice was probably one day old (fried rice is traditionally made with leftover rice).  My other companion received a 10 oz. thick cut pork chop.  Being so thick and also pork, the meat was flavorless and dry.  I sampled a piece from the outside edge and one cut from the center; the first piece had the flavor form the char, but the center cut one was so bland I could not finish it.  The defining part of the dish was it's spicy chili honey sauce, as it made the pork edible.  The grits were OK, not amazing, but not bad.  Two five oz. pork chops would've probably done the dish more justice than that 10 oz monstrosity.  Meats that need to be cooked through should not be thick cut unless it's well marbled, and we all know how hard it is to find marbled pork nowadays.  Last, my dish consisted of around 4 oz. of rice cakes cooked in an overly salty \"sauce\" with pork and bok choy topped with four seared sea scallops.  For some reason, I was expecting my sea scallops to be around 30% larger in diameter, but realistically being in Pittsburgh the only scallops that are available are ones that are shipped from the coast.  The scallops were seared perfectly (but honestly now, searing sea scallops is not difficult).  The rice cakes were cooked properly, but they were miniscule in size and thickness, and overly salty from the \"spicy\" sauce, which had maybe quarter of a clove of minced garlic, and half a seeded chili pepper.  The bok choy was cooked beyond recognition, and basically became a sponge for the soy sauce.  The few strips of julienned pork was probably 2 oz. meat, and did not fit well with the dish as it got lost in the sauce.  DISHES THAT ARE SOUPY IN NATURE SHOULD HAVE LARGER PIECES OF MEAT; ONLY DISHES THAT HAVE MORE SOLID FOOD THAN LIQUID SHOULD BE ALLOWS TO USE SMALL PIECES OF MEAT.  I was not impressed at all.  Yes, I keep switching between soup and sauce; it's labeled as a sauce in the menu, and it was definitely too salty to be a soup, but it's consistency was that of soup, and it was served with one of those soup spoons you get with egg drop soup in Asian restaurants.  For it's price, SOBA should've been much better.  I would've given SOBA two stars, but our waiter was attentive and the ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"Why come here?  This is a perfect place for a date, anniversary or for a big happy group. Came here with a large group after a great successful conference at work.  Atmosphere was elegant. Low lights and a fantastic interior decor set your mood right. Service and food were excellent. Parking is easy and there is valet if you're feeling lazy.   What to get?  Our menu was limited because there were so many people. The mushroom dumpling app was phenomenal! Tried chicken and shrimp pad Thai. Portion was extremely generous, Pittsburgh or Midwest style.  Pad Thai is one of my signature dishes and I'm a little snob about it. I tried it out to basically take notes to perfect it more. The chicken was cooked well but on the bland side. Also the rice noodles were stickier than usual.  It needed more chopped peanuts. The garnishing cilantro were wilted and topped with lots of crazy spicy chilis.  But overall it was a great dish. My friend tried tandoori salmon with lentils and it looked insanely fresh and appealing. It was incredibly delicious.   Would come back?  Totally! Also it's located next door to Umi which is said to be the best sushi place in the Burgh.   Arigato gozaimas, SOBA! See you soon."}
{"text":"Amazing Two Fish Tempura Fat Roll...one of the best things I've tasted, seriously. Excellent Thai Corn Chowder. Incredible Black Cod. This place does Asian Fusion well!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed going to Soba but the atmosphere is even more inviting and enjoyable now that they have renovated and expanded the restaurant.  It is still a bit pretentious more so than any of the other restaurants in the Big Burrito group, but I'm willing to overlook that because the food is so fantastic.  They always have a decent wine list, though on my most recent visit my friend and I were disappointed that they did not have a Reisling available by the glass.  She opted for the Louis Latour Pinot Noir and I opted for the amber cider which was delicious.  We shared the Lobster Roll which was fantastic though I have noticed that the size of the individual rolls are now almost half the size they were from about 2-3 years ago however they are still absolutely delicious.  For dinner we both ordered the Pad Thai which is always delicious choice particularly if you love Pad Thai - I've never had a bad dish of it here at Soba.  If you love spicy food be sure to ask them to bring the spice trio of chili sauces with your meal.  Some of my other favorite items on the menu are: the crispy tofu - many times when I've dined alone in the lounge area I've ordered the crispy tofu and the seaweed salad - it's a nice light dinner option and probably the best tofu that I've eaten at a restaurant - great option for vegetarians.  The corn chowder has a bit of a kick to it, is full of complex flavors and the crab is always tender and fresh.  The Korean bbq ribs literally melt in your mouth - my sister-in-law is Korean and makes the family Korean bbq when her and my brother visit from California and it's always delicious, but Soba's Korean bbq ribs blow my sister-in-law's out of the water - they will make your mouth water.  If you like steak, then the filet mignon with the chili garlic mashed potatoes will have you in heaven.  I only eat beef a handful of times each year and typically it is on my birthday when I indulge in Soba's filet or on occasion when I'm at Eleven and order the Eleven burger.  The duck is also spectacular and I would highly recommend it as well.  You honestly cannot go wrong with almost anything on their menu.  The food is consistently fresh and delicious!  I will definitely return to Soba time and again."}
{"text":"Had the famous \"Birthday Coupon\" and decided to make it worth the free entree. This place has been on my list for a while, and I was finally able to convince my husband make the trip for date night.   The only seating available without a reservation was at the bar, which is never a problem for us. We were two of the only three people there, and it was really quiet, so perfect!  We were greeted by the bartender who was very knowledgeable and friendly. He provided us with drink menus and gave us an ample amount of time to decide.   We started with the hamachi sashimi, which was a brilliant blend of pomegranate, pear, and avocado with amber jack tuna. A spicy little sauce was plated along with it, and the mix was really tasty. Beautiful presentation as well.   My main course was the Thaikkal curry, which was a fun, educational dish for me. First, the eggplant was fire-grilled, which blended so well with the curry sauce. It was plated with bean sprouts and slices of fresh mango, which I had never thought to pair with a curry. The roti was fried, which I didn't prefer.   My husband ordered the seafood hot pot. Quite a full portion of seafood with a side of rice, this vast array of shellfish went down quick. His comment was \"It's Big Burrito salty.\"  Really savory food and pleasant service in an atmosphere drowned in Massive Attack. That's Soba."}
{"text":"Normally this is one of my favorite places, but last night I was very disappointed. We asked to sit by the open doors since it was my birthday and we were told no. We had a 5pm reservation and we were told we had to sit at a 2 top when we were the only ones in the entire restaurant. Another table was seated directly next to us, which was very disruptive to our dinner since at this time there were only our groups in the restaurant, and no other tables had been seated the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"Soba is not only a great lounge but also a great restaurant.  Part of the Big Burrito Group, Soba has a pan-Asian cuisine.  The lounge area is somewhat small, but even when the bar is crowded it doesn't take too long to get a drink.  The food is fabulous and the atmosphere in the dining area is anything but crowded.  Multiple floors and an outside deck gives you a number of choices on where to eat."}
{"text":"It's a nice, intimate restaurant with an elegant setting. Valet is very professional and the staff make guest feel welcome. I had the pad Thai. There was so much food and I was very satisfied. My girlfriend had the Long Island duck which was pretty tasty from the piece I had. It took a little long to come so they comped the wine and dessert. Plus it was her birthday so that helped. The server could have poured water more often."}
{"text":"I've had many great experience at Soba, but our most recent visit didn't quite match the rest.  The service was great, as usual, but we had a few misses with the food.  We started off with the spicy pork lettuce wraps, which were delicious last time!  This time, soooo salty.  Omg.  It was as if someone had spilled salt into the bowl.  Granted, it wasn't enough to be completely inedible, but it did sort of ruin the dish.  For the main course, I had my usual Bi Bim Bap and my wife had her usual tuna.  Her tuna was done perfectly.  They seem to have this nailed.  My bi bim bap was hot, but lacked any of the crispy, slightly dry rice around the outsides of the bowl.  It was all just regular-old, glutinous, freshly steamed rice.  For bi bim bap lovers, you know that the little added crunch and texture of that crusty rice really makes the dish!  We had an early reservation so we could make an early show.  My guess is that the kitchen hadn't quite \"gotten up to speed\" for the dinner rush yet.  Oh well.  I would still whole-heartedly recommend Soba, but this time was a miss."}
