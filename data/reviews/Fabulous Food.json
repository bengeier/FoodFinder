{"text":"This company has been an absolute pleasure to do business with.  They are so professional and did an outstanding job with my Husband's 50th birthday party last night. They arrived promptly 2 hours before the party and totally transformed my house - the table linens, decorations and flowers they provided were beautiful. The food was amazing, an original menu beautifully presented with great attention to detail.  All my guests were very impressed.  There was more than ample food, we will be eating left-overs for days, not that it will be any hardship! The staff were excellent - they managed to achieve that balance between being attentive but totally unobtrusive, I can't say enough about how great they all were.  After the party was over they cleared everything, left the house immaculate, packed up all the left-overs and it was almost as if they had never been there!  This was a totally stress-free party which meant that we were free to actually enjoy time with our friends, I will most definitely use Fabulous Foods for any future parties and would absolutely recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"We had Fabulous Food cater our wedding. The food was indeed \"fabulous\"! Everyone commented on how great the food was.  Emily, Christina, and the rest of the staff were all very friendly and professional. From the personal tasting session to the flawless service at the reception, they really helped made our wedding a success. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The DÃ­a de los Muertos event at the Desert Botanical Garden (DBG) was fantastic this year; however, the food catered by this company was certainly not \"fabulous.\" The food was average at best and certainly overpriced for the quality.   The catered menu for the DBG celebration consisted of a fairly limited menu of chips & salsa, and a choice of either Machaca Tacos (shredded beef) or Fish Tacos. There may have been one salad option, too.   The chips were fresh and the salsa was delicious, but seemed a little overpriced at $4.50 for a small serving. The Machaca Taco plate came with a side of rice and refried black beans for $13.95. The shredded beef was tender and had good flavor, but the rice was cold and the refried beans were dried out and lacking flavor. Also, the Horchata tasted like sweet milk and was seriously lacking in spice - who forgot the cinnamon?!   Besides the lackluster food, I was also disappointed by the lack of professionalism and attitude of the catering crew. This was a cool event to cater, but they all looked bored.   Based on this experience trying a meal catered by FF and interacting with their staff, I would not hire them in the future."}
{"text":"Arizona Science Center  deserves better.  The \" Cafe\" doesn't serve coffee or tea.  What a silly joke if it weren't so sad!  People need to TRUST that no one business is going to unilaterally change the definition of the word, \"CAFE\" to not include a hot cup of coffee or tea.  False advertising"}
{"text":"We had Fabulous Food cater a wedding reception, and are so thankful for all the expertise, guidance and outstanding level of service they delivered.  Everyone we dealt with at Fabulous Food is at the top of their field at what they do.  They set up all the indoor and outdoor spaces in such a way to make the most of each area, given the size of our party.  Every menu item was perfectly executed and presented, and their staff bent over backwards for us and our guests to meet their every need (I say \"bent over\" in the figurative sense, but think they might have literally if someone had asked!).  The Sales Consultant and Chef perfectly guided me to keep things on track so I could focus on guests and even enjoy the party myself - they are masters.  They understood from the beginning what our vision was, and always had my back to make sure that vision was delivered regardless of job title. Throughout the night our guests would approach us to compliment all the great food and the event.  I could give them no greater compliment than to say that they made us look good!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I have to say that Fabulous Foods really impressed me with the service, professional demeanor and especially the food when I attended two events that they catered.  The Yelp.com CMYE at Desert Botanical Gardens was my first experience with Fab Food.  I was pleasantly surprised again and again with the quality of the apps being brought around at this event.  Bacon wrapped figs...yum. Several kinds of brushetta...yum. The marinated shrimp was delicious. Everything they brought out was delicious!  Service was really friendly and professional. Everyone I spoke with was informative about what they were serving and pleasant to chat with as well.  After the Yelp.com CMYE I went on to the beergarden event at the DBG.  This was catered as well by Fabulous Foods. Again, pleasant and agreeable staff and service.  If I need an event catered, Fabulous Foods will be the first call I make!"}
{"text":"So impressed with Fabulous Foods!! So professional and easy to work with. They were always flexible and willing to go the extra mile. They showed up on time (even a little early) and the staff was dressed nicely and ready to go. The food was delicious and the set up was beautiful. Kristina did an amazing job working with me to make sure we had everything we needed for our event. Amazing staff!!! I highly recommend  Fabulous Foods."}
