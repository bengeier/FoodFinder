{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend, and will definitely be back! The House cocktail is a craft riff on a margarita, and was delicious. The beef and Brussels sprouts skewers were amazing, a lot of different flavors on a small plate! The ahi tuna app, meh, not exactly memorable. The wait staff was friendly and helpful, and they have a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great food, happy hour and staff!  Keep up the good work.  Very accommodating for small and large groups!"}
{"text":"I have tried Indigo Crow three or four times for HH in Cave Creek over the past year and it's gotten worse each time...and the most recent was the nail in the coffin. My bf & I went and sat at the bar.. First- we were ignored for better part of 5 minutes by bartender w glasses & a beard. There were only 2 other couples at the bar...when he finally acknowledged us he asked us \"what could he do for us\"..we looked at each other and asked for menus and our bar top to be wiped from previous guests.  Second- we ordered four appetizers..flatbread, brussel sprouts, a salad, and pork wings. First two came out- one was wrong item entirely- and after offering them to us (mussels) the MANAGER auctioned them off to other \"regular\" guests after I had meekly agreed to try them..I typically don't like mussles but was going to give them a shot..guess not. The flatbread was good, but tiny for price, Brussels sprouts were ok. Better the first visit I'd made...The third item, the salad, didn't come until we'd finished the flatbread and sprouts completely. Then the bartender blames the chef for the pork wings that took 35 minutes..brings them, and leaves them on the bill.  Third and final annoyance- I called the restaurant to explain why I was unhappy, as my bf & I do not see eye to eye on service standards and he get flustered when I feel the need to complain..so to avoid an argument with him I called later and the MANAGER ( who auctioned food off in front of us, AND was sitting screwing around w his phone at the bar during our visit-I find that SO unprofessional unless it's McDonald's) took my email address and promised a visit on him to rectify the events, agreeing that service should go basically unnoticed when dining out (his words) and I haven't heard a thing since.. My bf & I had gone to J&G at the Phoenician recently, where prices were comparable, but the staff and service were impeccable. Indigo Crow is a No-Go"}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time, tried the mussels and we shared a few other appetizers and all were very good. Great ambience and love the enclosed wine rack. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a decent place to eat in Cave Creek that did not break my credit card limit, but a step up from the \"bar\" food that is so prevalent in the area.  On YELP I found the new restaurant Indigo Crow. Loved the building and architecture in a serene setting, offset from the main road, across a bridge. Smiling diners were walking out as we entered. Staff was extremely friendly and attentive. The prices were very reasonable. We had the rib eye steak and the linguini with chicken and prosciutto in a cream sauce. Although the steak was a bit fatty, the taste was outstanding. The pasta was also delicious. There seemed to be nice seating for outdoor dining, including an upstairs with an outdoor balcony.  The bar faces windows that open for outdoor bar service, complete with barstools.   The Indigo Crow will now be my GO TO spot in Cave Creek. I am anxious to take friends to this special place."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 5....   We stopped in for a late dinner on a weeknight and found the restaurant basically empty so we decided to sit at the bar.   Positives: Darren who first helped us and continued to throughout out meal was wonderful! Very attentive and helpful.   Food was wonderful! I will definitely go back for the scallops and crime brûlée!!   Negatives: The other female bartender, Becky ruined our evening. She was constantly \"checking on us\" though it felt more like see was trying to steal the check away from her fellow bartender. We heard much more about her personal life and what was negatively going on with her then I cared to know. And language she was using was not appropriate. Instead of a romantic intimate dinner I was on the set of Maury.   The flight of wine was decent though overall selection of wine is weak."}
{"text":"Unbelievable view and ambience.  I only wish the food and service were worth the wait. After ordering we waited 1 hour and 30 minutes for our entres. My steak was barely warm when served and the cut was very vainey. We dined there on March 13th, management should have worked out the kinks by now. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg.... All I have to say is that this restaurant/ atmosphere was welll needed in cave creek. The service was just fantastic, every one was attentive and on their game. Staff were friendly and very personable. We tried the a few starters of the caprese and sprouts and sirloin .  I had the duck and my husband had the fillet . It was just fantastic.  We will definitely be a regular here. Thanks for the great night"}
{"text":"The service was great. Food was good yet overpriced. We truly left feeling like our meal was very expensive for the quanity of food offered. The service was the highlight. They dont have a large craft beer selection, but their wine selection was excellent. My husband ordered the pork chops, and wasnt thrilled with the sauce they swore was amazing. I ordered the shrimp rissoto and thought the four shrimp were cooked well, but the plate lacked flavor and variety. We both were shocked with how stingy the restaurant was with vegetables. Glad we went. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"FINALLY we have a restaurant that caters to the critical appetite and not to PUB FOOD like Harolds and the Tap Haus, Hogs & Horses....etc...... THIS IS A FABULOUS RESTAURANT!  Not an expansive menu, and the Executive Chef knows what she is doing.  The owner is ALWAYS present and the staff are great!  We have now made 4 visits to this restaurant and each time it gets better.  Last night we sat at the bar and ate appetizers that were off the chart good and had a fantastic bottle of wine.  You get as involved in the environment or not!    Good luck to you Don and your staff...your daughter has it nailed in the food presentation and fantastic tastes that exceed any restaurant in the area, including BINKLEYS!  We live in Cave Creek and finally have a place that is fun, good food and fantastic atmosphere....what a great evening!  Great bartender...love Jackie!!  Sandi Eppel Creeker Local"}
{"text":"Wow, Bob was awesome. He custom crafted delicious cocktails for us - service and food were top notch. Celebrated my mother's birthday and the group agreed it was a special evening. Thanks Bob!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new restaurant and it's going to become a destination. The decor is lovely with an open concept. There is plenty of outdoor seating including a sweet little outdoor bar. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and one of the owners who quickly accommodated our request to sit outside by a heater. The menu is interesting and carefully crafted to not have too much and overwhelm. There is a lovely wine list. We both had cosmopolitans to start and they were good if not a little warm due to delay in being served. That brings me to the only kink we had in our evening. The service was slow. Normally we wouldn't mind this as we were out for the evening but it caused our drinks to be served warm, our food cold and left our glasses empty most of the night. We loved the food, the Catalina salad is served in a fresh and interesting manner, the brussels sprouts and beef were tangy and tender, the shrimp appetizer was a large portion cooked perfectly and the seafood pasta was very flavorful and the fish was cooked perfectly (although the portion of pasta was small). These are seasoned owners and I'm confident they will work out service issues. Go try this gem you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best place for Happy Hour in town. The food is delicious . Service is excellent. experience was very good."}
{"text":"Just got done having happy hour although the dinner menu doesn't start until 5pm and we got there at 4pm, The appetizers were AMAZING!! The staff was awesome especially our waiter, plus they had a great kids menu too. I highly recommend this place especially for happy hour, half off all appetizers and the portions were the perfect amount of food."}
{"text":"I brought my dad and mom to dine at the \"Crow\" affectionately called at the Corrales NM location. Owners Don and Gina have certainly continued their tradition with phenomenal quality of service and tasteful food. Wine selection as good as any 5 star restaurant could be. Mom had the lamb cooked perfectly, Dad had the filet that was tender and the most delicious tenderloin we've ever tasted. The rib eye was cooked perfectly at medium rare. Appetizers were scrumptious. The desserts Crete brûlée, key lime pie and the chocolate mousse awesome.  Highly recommend the Indigo Crow Restaurant and Bar. Best new restaurant in the Phoenix area. Looking forward to their expanded lunch and brunch dining coming soon according to Gina and Don."}
{"text":"I'm not thrilled with all aspects of tonight's experience. But Jackie provided excellent service and the scallops were amazing."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely terrific. My husband had the ahi tuna, I had the filet mignon but they switched the sauce for me to the cabernet sauce they use on another dish because I also had the charred romaine and both plates would have had a gorgonzola concoction on them. The romaine was senational, the main courses were too. We also had a delicious chocolate cake-and-mousse dish for dessert.  Our server was Ashley and she was attentive, helpful, funny, and kept us informed when the kitchen got backed up.  Though not out of line for an upscale place, the restaurant is not cheap -- so check out the menu online to get a sense of it.  My only complaint is the noise level. Although we were there on a Saturday night (5/30), since the snowbirds had left, the place was half full. Even at that the place is just too noisy to be pleasant. I can only imagine how awful a full house would be.  Nevertheless, we'll definitely go back again; we'll just try to pick an odd week night and time, especially when the snowbirds return! It's great to have another excellent upscale restaurant choice in the Cave Creek area."}
{"text":"I've been there twice in the last two weeks and both experiences are similar.   Two weeks ago my brother and I arrived at 7pm and promptly sat at the bar. The single bartender was slammed with drink orders for tables, so it took about ten minutes for us to be served. We did appies and wine. Decent wine list and salad/appies to choose from. Salads arrived promptly after ordering but we waited 15-20 minutes for our appetizers to arrive. Tasty dishes, but took too long.  Last week I sat at a table with my parents. Again, salads arrived promptly after ordering but the main dishes took 20-30 minutes to arrive after we were done with the salads. All three dishes were only warm, no where  near hot. Food was very tasty.   After reading other reviews stating long waits for food to arrive from the kitchen, I think I've given this place my last shot. Too many other places that have comparable food but in a timely manner."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find. We planned to stop in just to check it out but stayed due to the amazing friendly and genuine service from Becky at the bar. She's the kind of person you want to come in to see. Her recommendation of the scallops was spot on. They were AMAZING!! Thanks for a great visit...you've created return guests for sure!"}
{"text":"Took my husband for his b'day dinner last night, first or second night they were open.  Fantastic food and great service.  We shared a grilled romaine salad and chipolte clams.  Both were very good, the broth with the clams was delish and we asked for extra bread so it would not go to waste- great bread! We had lamb chops and pork chop.  Both cooked to perfection, I like my pork medium rare and that is how it came out.  Had carrot cake for dessert-heavenly. Nice wine list too.  Can't wait to go back and try something else new on the menu.  Heard the duck is really good.Spencer was our server and did a great job."}
{"text":"THE RETURN TO THE CROW....I have been coming to Indigo Crow since it opened for happy hour as well as dinner.  I have had great experiences every time.  Recently it has changed the configuration of the bar area.  We were greeted by a lovely hostess this past Thursday evening.  We mentioned our group of 5 was there for happy hour and might stay for dinner.  With the new configuration of the bar area it is impossible for 5 to sit together at a table and no room at the small bar.  The new rule as explained to us by the manager was no happy hour seating outside the bar area.  She didn't want the happy hour crowd to interfere with the dinner crowd.  We were offered a table on the patio which we begrudgingly took (It is still quite warm out to enjoy food outdoors) in an otherwise empty restaurant except for the bar.  Service from Jackie top notch as always.  Food was mediocre because it was HOT on the patio.  We left after 1 drink.  BOTTOM LINE....If you want a happy hour crowd make them feel welcome.  If you don't, eliminate the option.  Manager really made us feel like we were an intrusion to the restaurant.  Saw another foursome walk in and out while we were there.  Probably told no room for any more happy hour guests.  Probably won't be returning and as a Concierge won't be sending anymore of my guests up that way to have a similar experience."}
{"text":"The overall experience was not bad. The food was good but nothing blew me away except the bread, which was heavenly. Our server, Conner was delightful. We ordered the lamb, which had no seasoning. The risotto was flavorless and the blackberry glaze did not accent the dish at all.  We also ordered a pasta dish, which was the special for the evening and felt the dish was average. The big disappoint was the owner walking around in attire not suited for the restaurant but instead a slumber party. The owner was also drinking the entire time I was there and appeared to huddle up with staff at the bar. Was expecting more.........."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner there. This place is almost too good for Cavecreek... Excellent service. The music was very interesting also not so loud and obtrusive. I'll definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Just have a fabulous happy hour here. The drink prices and happy hour menu are worth the drive. Don't miss this gem in the boulders of Carefree. Ashely was a wonderful server and the bartender Johnnie deserves a shout out for a terrific Clamato Beer."}
{"text":"Just went here for dinner. First time I have ever had \"pig wings\", an appetizer like chicken wings but more like pork ribs. Try them, you'll love them. Our waiter was Sam. He was awesome! So friendly and helpful explaining the menu. My wife had the Lobster Ravioli and loved it. And she is not easily impressed. I had the Rack of Lamb. It was presented with a blackberry sauce and over Risotto. Service and ambiance was superlative. A little pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"Just a delicious meal!  From a great arugula and beet salad to a savory and perfectly seasoned trout and shrimp entree to a great cocktail and excellent wine choice (by our sommelier, Bob) thoroughly enjoyed our evening.  Will be returning ASAP.  Wish it was tonight!"}
{"text":"I love this restuarunt!  It's definitely a favorite!  The atmosphere is very upscale yet relaxing and conducive for fine foods and exquisite libations.  We sat at the bar and had excellent service by a young man named Aiden who was very friendly yet professional and I have to mention easy on the eyes.  We had the Ahi, shrimp tacos, wings, beef and brussels skewers which melted in our mouths.  All fresh ingredients which were cooked to perfection.  Hats off to the chef!  Cheers and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant with Owners and staff that are personable and friendly!  I ordered the Catalina salad and the Rack of Lamb!  Both fantastic  The owner then brought me a nice section of Lobster Ravioli to try and it was extremely good!  Ended with a Chocolate Brûlée w ginger cookie   Bottom line - this is a great restaurant that is a year old  Fantastic dishes with a superb Wine selection   There is a upstairs Bar and Outdoor balcony that offers outdoor dining w beautiful sunset views!   Will at the bar will provide you with Top notch service and is very personable and super nice  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This was top ten dinner of all time!  Our server was Bethany and made experience extraordinary.   Appetizer ahi tuna poke and truffle fries were wonderful. I had bone-in filet with add on of shrimp and scallops. Others in party had mojito chicken and salmon, clean plates all around! End of spring break so we tried carrot cake, key lime pie and flan and would rate in that order!!!"}
{"text":"Had a totally unacceptable meal. First, an order of rack of lamb, requested medium rare, was delivered well done; replacement reflected that the kitchen was capable of producing the meat at requested temperature but the lamb quality was average.  The other main course, steak frites, makes one wonder if the restaurant is interested in maintaining customers.  The steak, requested and served rare, was presented as two quarter inch thick slabs of virtually inedible beef sitting on top of a large pile of decent fries.  The heavy duty knife was unable to cut the sinewy meat no matter which angle of attack used.  Was our sixth and last visit to this restaurant; quite a shame to experience such a rapid deterioration of quality."}
{"text":"2 visits in one week. First we sat at bar. Took 10 min to get a cocktail, but bartender became attentive afterwards. Ordered 2 apps at Happy Hour. Prawns and Pig Wings. Prawns were decent size but only 4 to an order. Pig Wings were dried out. Pretty sure they were sitting or someone's mistake. 3 nights later a party of 8 splitting apps at HH. Service was so slow and basically no one there. Bar was out of everything. Apps were excellent tonight! Skewers!!!! Mussels, Mushroom flatbread ...all wonderful. Prices are to high, but HH is a great deal. Don't be in a hurry...it will be awhile."}
{"text":"Indigo Crow is a relatively new restaurant in Cave Creek.  My husband and I were away for several months so really didn't know they had opened.  Our neighbor and a city councilman suggested we try the restaurant and definitely the mussels. All we can say is \"WOW.\"  Service, food and atmosphere are terrific.  We have been back numerous times and every aspect of this restaurant  has been exemplary. I own a gallery  in Carefree and I am asked daily where can I get a great dinner.  Well, new suggestion, Indigo Crow."}
{"text":"I had family in town for the holidays and decided to take them here.  I think everyone including myself was expecting this place to be a little different but we were all a little blown away by how expensive it was.  I got a salad and it was definitely on the small side and not exactly in line with how much salads should cost.  I'm from the north east where everything is expensive and we aren't afraid to pay for a good meal but Indigo Crow was a huge letdown.  Service was excellent, but sadly I wouldn't go back unless I had extra money to burn and especially with so many great choices of restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Pig wings a must. We go usually once a week for happy hour and love it. Either downstairs or up you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very pretty it's very nice and modern and has art inside a very pleasant place to eat dinner.  The food was so-so yes it's very salty as other reviewer said my husband thought the Porkchop was just OK although it looked very good but tasted just OK.  He had a stomachache all night from it.  The part that I wasn't happy with was the bill was over $100 and supposedly it was happy hour?    The price indicator with two $$ is not correct at all.  This is what confused me.   It is definitely a $$$ menu."}
{"text":"Despite the food being good. Only giving 2 stars because the service was so bad. Waited at hostess stand for over 10 minutes for someone to show up and seat us. The woman who,seated us said she would also be our server. She took a drink order, and didn't return.  After around 15 minutes, someone else brought our drinks and we asked her to send our server over. Our server finally showed up (after another lengthy wait) and told us she forgotten about us! That certainly didn't make us feel like valued customers!  We enjoyed our meals but will not return to be ignored again!"}
{"text":"WoW!  YES PLEASE! We've been searching for the \"perfect\" spot to dine and drink in Carefree/Cave Creek and have found it!!!! The vibe is perfectly classy and cozy... couldn't even decide what to order -the menu has lot's of delicious options. Mussels and pig wings as an appetizer ... PERFECT.  I had the Ling entree and my husband had the rack of lamb. Both were cooked perfectly- tender and juicy. The vegetables were organic and delicious. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive to us at all times. The craft cocktails were dynamic and obviously made with fresh squeezed juices, which is VERY important to us- nothing worse than a margarita made with pre made mix!  I love this place and will be coming back at least twice a week."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 20yr anniversary here. We loved our server Bob!! His wine suggestion was spot on! The filet w/surf @ turf was amazing!! We would come back in a heart beat!!"}
{"text":"Got seated at a table that was so out of level the silverware slid into my lap. He got the Chilean sea bass and it had pin bones in it. I had the vegetable pasta and the pasta was so mushy I couldn't get it on my fork without it falling apart. Disappointing experience for a $120 bill. The Tickled Pink cocktail was the best part - it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Our compliments to the entire team at Indigo Crow! We happened upon the restaurant through Yelp while in the area - and so glad that we did. The food was prepared perfectly-not over seasoned - and they obviously use fresh and high quality ingredients. Our entire order, from drinks to dessert, was delivered correctly and totally yummy! The waitstaff was very knowledgable, attentive and professional. Thanks Bob and Sophie. We will be back."}
{"text":"The family and I stopped here for a nice dinner while we were staying in Cave Creek.  The décor is really beautiful and rustic--and the ceilings are very tall, almost like a barn.  Really cool building.  Our waiter was also super nice and very personable; he had a ton of tales and loved to chat!  The food overall was also super yummy.  Among other items, we really enjoyed the arugula and beet salad, the steak, the ahi tuna, and my scallops were very nicely done.  Really nice time, and paired with a cold glass of sauvignon blanc, a great dinner over all."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service. Cool vibe and muted industrial ambiance. Wife and I had the shrimp risotto and it was really good. The wait staff was happy and genuine about serving our group. Nothing missed. We are definitely going back and I like having more good dining options in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Amazing new restaurant in Cave Creek.  It is very modern looking and expensive so I hope the get the clientele there are hoping for.  Waiter was great, service was great, drinks were great and the food was PHENOMENAL.  Out of the group of 7 of us I tried the Scallops, Lamb, Artichoke Pasta, Filet, and the Artichoke Pasta with Duck breast.  Didn't want the night the end we had such a great time - can't wait to come back and try the wine list"}
{"text":"Lord have mercy. This was one of the best experiences I've had for a dinner for the first time in a long while. We ordered the Brie En Croute for an appetizer. The Brie was baked in a flakey pastry covered in apples and berries soaked in a red wine reduction. Absolutely TO DIE FOR. My mom and I almost arm wrestled to lick the plate! For dinner I ordered the lobster ravioli and she ordered the filet. The garlic mashed potatoes were delicious but paled in comparison to everything else. The steak was killer in a garlic, butter cheese sauce. The asparagus were unfortunately bitter. The lobster ravioli was delicious and even though the main ingredient was cheese, it was not heavy at all.  The best of all was out server Karlie, she was so attentive and kind. She is exceptional as a server and I would hate to have anyone else but her for my next visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I relocated from the San Francisco area to Carefree two months ago and found this gem.  We've visited Indigo Crow three times, each time for Happy Hour (every day from 3pm-6pm).  The drinks are delicious, my personal favorite is the Tickled Pink - Titos, prickly pear syrup, raspberries, sparkling rose.  My husband likes the house Margarita and the Stagecoach Mule.  As good as the drinks are, the food is even better.  We've had the Beef & Brussels Sprout Skewers which included bleu cheese crumbles, olive oil-soaked cherry tomatoes, red onions, and a peppercorn honey mustard vinaigrette; the Pig Wings which are sriracha-glazed pork wings and whipped potatoes with a tarragon mushroom gravy; Parmesan Truffle Fries with fresh herbs and Himalayan truffle salt; and finally, my favorite, the Ahi Tuna with fried kale.  The portions are large and definitely enough to fill you up.  The only thing I can't figure out is why there isn't a line out the door every night.  If this restaurant was located in the San Francisco area, you'd be waiting a week to get a reservation and would never be able to find a seat at the bar during Happy Hour."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dining experience at Indigo Crow. Johnny was knowledgeable and helpful with the menu.  I had the lamp chops which were fantastic.  Another in our group loved the Lobster Ravioli.  Beware: the dessert portion sizes are more than adequate. I recommend sharing."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite happy hour! Between the two of us, my husband and I have tried almost everything on the happy hour menu (food & cocktails). The Brie En Croute is the only thing we haven't tried yet (aside from the salads)  and that's just because we're saving it for dessert. My favorite starters are the Parmesan Truffle Fries, Sriracha Glazed Pig Wings and Lemon & Garlic Prawns. My husband loves the Steamed Mussels. The Yellow Brick Road cocktail (golden beet infused gin, canton ginger, lemon & apple bitters) is my favorite craft cocktail but the Mexican Mule and She's the Bee's Knees are also very yummy. Typically, I'm not a fan of rye, bourbon or whisky but the St. Anthony is admittedly delicious. The only two entrees we've tried so far are the Lobster Ravioli and the Bouillabaisse and they did not disappoint. Both were excellent! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here. Our server was slow to arrive initially but after that the service was good. We tried the poke, pulled mozzarella and tomato, chicken, and filet mignon. I felt my chicken was good but could have had a little more flavor. Everything else was quite delicious. I would have liked to have a healthier starch option."}
{"text":"The food is very, very  good - flatbread is great and the lobster ravioli is excellent. The service is very, very bad - one bartender who did her best but one bartender on a very bust Friday night, ridiculous."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a wonderful dinner again at Indigo Crow. Started out with a raspberry mojito, and I'm glad I did. Without a doubt, the BEST raspberry mojito I've ever tasted! That's a big statement since I always order a raspberry mojito and so basically I've tasted every mojito in Scottsdale.  We brought friends with us and first enjoyed a round of appetizers to share: scallops, beef tenderloin skewers with Brussels sprouts, mango & prosciutto salad, (my 3 favorite appetizers!!!) then I ordered a 2nd mojito, and could have easily ordered a 3rd.  For dinner I enjoyed the rack of lamb with raspberry sauce over risotto. It was lovely and a perfect accompaniment with my mojito. Our friends ordered the airline chicken, and declared it to be \"the tastiest chicken ever\".    Although everyone was stuffed, we decided to share a dessert: red velvet moon pies. Fabulous. It's not on the menu, so I can't promise it will be available for you, but if it happens to be on special, do yourself a favor and order it.  There are so many wonderful things to love about Indigo Crow. This is starting to look like our favorite dinner hangout. Hope they get some gelato on the menu pronto and while I'm \"wishing\" maybe add homemade potato chips for happy hour.  A gal can dream. can't she?!"}
{"text":"Trust the reviews that say this place is pricy.  The muscles we not very fresh tasting and garlic shrimp was slimy.  Caesar  salad dressing was too strong.  Dessert and apps we just average.  Waiter seemed like he might have been hung over or stoned. Very odd and our bill was super high. Do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you are going for happy hour, which is a good value, but you will be \"paying\" with awful and rude service! If you go for dinner, it is grossly overpriced with awful service-choices!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner. Great cocktails and bubbly. Mussels, Catalina, beet salad, & rack of lamb were delicious. Meat was cooked to perfection. Sammy and Bob were great. Nice atmosphere very trendy. I am not a restaurant reviewer and appreciate economy of words so I will stop now. But just say that this is a great option in cave creek. Although no Bbq on menu. ;)"}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service was awesome. Would fully recommended this restaurant. They also have local beers on tap."}
{"text":"I just need to say something about a fast talking waitress that works during happy hour here. Well it was my husband and my first time to this place. We did not know what was on the HH menu, Waitress was nice and gave us the run down, That's all good, Then the moment she said half off bottles of wine we said sure. Food is good well dilivered. Then the bill came, We asked the waitress why did you charge for full price on wine bottle, She then said \"first bottle full price and 2nd bottle half off\" , No way did she say that to us at all? We did tell her so about what she told us.  Waitress then said \"Oh sorry\" and did not offer to deduct the price. I call that a scam and lied to us. Poor character on her part. Sad...We will not be returning. Better place next door at Brugos."}
{"text":"Great food and music. Food was very tasty! The music selection is on point! Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Upscale and fashionable this restaurant is in the Stagecoach Village which houses some typical higher end less touristy stores than in other areas of Cave Creek. The service was excellent and I liked the ambiance. We salmon and tuna which were excellent and well prepared. I would say they missed the coveted 5th star if the menu was a bit more varied. Overall very good especially if you wasn't something other than barbecue after your touring and shopping Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and artfully prepared food - a real gem in the Cave Creek/Carefree area."}
{"text":"Fabulous.  Thrilled this type of restaurant opened in Cave Creek. We tried many things but the favorites were the grilled romaine salad, salmon and ahi.  Service was perfect - attentive without disturbing our conversation, great recommendations and very knowledgeable about the menu. I would have given them 5 stars but for two things: 1. the portions are too big - I like to start with a salad or appetizer but the mains are so large it makes me not want to have a first and I am not a doggie bag fan.  2. Supposedly their roots are New Mexican and there wasn't anything on the menu I felt had a New Mexico flare - I would have loved to have some of those options."}
{"text":"Been here at least 5 times. This is my go to spot now. Hands down the best food in the far north Scottsdale/Cave Creek area. I have yet to order a bad entree. This is a must try. Great bar and cool table seating. Sit at the bar if you can, because Jesse and Becky are great. Do yourself a favor and try this place. I might see you there. I just love it!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far and both times were great. Sat at bar once and table once. Bartender and server were both friendly, knew the menu and service was great. Lobster ravioli is delicious!  Filet was also good. Love having this spot in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I have loved this place and certainly enjoyed the food, ambience and service every time. I recently took my mother to dinner here, and, in the main, this was another excellent experience. There were 3 minor factors that kept this experience from being of the 5-star variety:  1. The waitress was a little slow, but, in her defense, the place was very busy. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, and the way she described the specials caused my mother and me to abandon our initial decisions in favor 2 or the special selections - kudos! 2. I had asked the waitress if she knew which variety a particular chardonnay on the wine list was (the vintner offers 6) because the wine list was not specific. I offered the names of two varieties, but she was uncertain. Had she taken the time to ask either the bartender of the sommelier, she likely would have sold us a bottle. That said, the wine list should have been more specific. 3. The young man who brought our salads to the table asked if we wanted fresh ground pepper (we said yes), but he returned with the pepper mill, he dispensed the pepper without moving the mill over the plate to insure even coverage.  These three issues (all of which can be addressed though better training) aside, the experience was wonderful. The young ladies at the hostess stand were gracious and ebullient, and our waitress was professional and largely attentive. The food, as usual, was superb (though the lettuce in our Caesar salads could have been more fresh). The chef de cuisine and chefs de partie deserve kudos, to be sure. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great bar, worst management ever.  Had a wonderful bartender, Johnny, who was doing the work of two, three or even four people, while the manager was totally oblivious, and got into two unnecessary debates with one of our party. The manager, a very young man with a cocky, entitled attitude, was much so busy defending himself when we asked him to help the bartender, that he spent several minutes telling us about his \"experience\" and that he has a wine certification. Finally, one of our group woke him from his monologue to as him if he would get our drinks. Later in the evening, the bartender was asking us how we were doing when the bartender rudely, ignorantly interrupted him to ask him for a pen. Really??  I would love to go back and have dinner, but not until I am assured the \"manager\" is gone."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! It has a great atmosphere as far as lighting/comfort, plus they had live music which was really fun. The food was fantastic and the service was even better. I had the Chilean sea bass which was to die for. We went with a group of 7 people and not one person was disappointed. If you live in the area or even if you are just visiting, you should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice for happy hour. Overall food pretty good -- especially for the price. Highly recommend the Beef & Brussel Skewers, Wild Ahi Tuna, and Sriracha Glazed Pig Wings. The Mozzarella used to come with proscuitto which it no longer does. Maybe it is because there was hardly any on the plate when it was supposed to be."}
{"text":"Food poisoning! I ate at this restaurant and waited about 90 minutes to get our food. The food took so long that we finished our bottle of wine before our entree arrived. The bread that they serve is amazing but don't let it fool you, I got so sick from this place I would never go back."}
{"text":"We love this place so much we've been there 3 times since it opened! They're still working out a few kinks but almost everything is a masterpiece. Things we've tried, loved and recommend are as follows. Appetizers: lemon garlic prawns, kabobs, scallops, mushroom flatbread were all amazing. Salads: charred romain and Catalina are great. We've had the filet, ago, lobster ravioli, strip, duck, and seafood pasta. The clam appetizer needs a little work. The seafood pasta would be better with a different noodle. Everything needs a little more seasoning. We saw the Brie appetizer yesterday and it looked amazing. They don't have a kids menu but the owner, Ron, spent half an hour with our table going over suggestions from our friends' children. Cave creek needed a place like this. We love some of the other places but the wine lists are lacking. Indigo crow has an awesome wine and drink selection! The happy hour is one of the best we've seen! We love the decor and the outside bar. There's a separate wine bar and eventually upstairs will be a lounge type section. Get there. Now."}
{"text":"This is by far the best happy hour in Cave Creek!!! The food is absolutely delicious, we have never had a bad meal!! The service is great and the atmosphere is beautiful!!! You owe it to yourself to experience this fabulous place, I cannot say enough good about it!!!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite restaurant in Carefree and Cave Creek.  The food is always delicious and the service is the best.  Last night I had the Salmon with fried Kale and Carrot chips.  So good.."}
{"text":"This place was big, but set up well. The bar is just big enough and the had the game on two small TVs. The staff was nice and knowledgeable. We changed our minds on seating after they seated us, and they didn't mind changing us to where we wanted to go. I wanted the filet but 10-12oz was too much for me; Justin talked to the chef and found a perfect 6oz filet. He substituted the potatoes for Brussels spouts too. And finally, the key lime pie was really good. The crust makes it!"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful atmosphere, good wine. This is where we take out of town guests when we want to have a conversation as the ambiance is relaxing and the noise level is quiet. The waitstaff does a great job of reading the table and knowing when to be chatty and when to leave you alone."}
{"text":"An incredible meal!  Great wine recommendation that paired well with our meal. Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. To top it off we had the opportunity to meet the owner chef. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill fast since 1st opened.... wouldn't recommend to anyone!!!!!!:( Food and prices are not customer friendly in the least :("}
{"text":"Food and service is excellent. Really unique and cool atmosphere.  Menu is simple yet diverse.  Cocktails were a touch on the weak side for the money.   Solid wine list."}
{"text":"We and our friends chose Indigo Crow for our \"Wednesday before Thanksgiving\" dinner while staying in Cave Creek.  The restaurant is relatively new (open less than a year, I think) with a very interesting online menu.  It was a good choice.  My wife and I shared two entrees\" Seared Ahi Tuna and Lobster Ravioli and both were very good.. We'd probably order them again.  The tuna was beautifully prepared: two thickly cuts, seared with a cool, sushi style interior.  The lobster ravioli, stuffed mainly with ricotta cheese was served with lobster medallions in a tasty sauce, and topped with a 4 to 5 oz in-the-shell lobster tail that was nicely steamed.  Our server was very good, but unfortunately the restaurant was unprepared for the number of customers.  Both the kitchen and the servers were greatly understaffed, so much so that the owners showed up to help out in the kitchen.  Fortunately, the quality of the food did not suffer, but we waited over 2 hours after ordering before our food arrived.  All were apologetic.    I didn't downgrade our review and gave them a pass on the service problems because I felt it was a one-time fumble as a new restaurant, with new owners, and they didn't appreciate in advance the number of diners that would confront their very limited staffing.  It should not happen again.  Beside we enjoyed the evening and the food."}
{"text":"Indigo Crow is one of my favorite restaurants in Cave Creek.  Great food, service, and love the Cave Creek views.  They have fabulous seafood and excellent menu selection.   I might add also the best happy hour in town.  The apple chutney brie, is out of this world.  Service has always been top notch, and my two favorite waiters Matt, and Sam only add to the excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Since Indigo opened, I've been here 4 times - but the first three visits were within the first few months of opening. Thus, we had a great experience twice, and the 3rd time not-so-great which caused us to delay a return visit. As a local, I want... I NEED to give local restaurants the benefit of the doubt and delay judgment. I'm so glad I did!! Today's visit was was fantastic and I'm a bit disappointed that I waited this long to return. I like to have several visits under my belt until I review new local Creek spots. The ambiance is pretty awesome - it's big, modern rustic in aesthetic, and very Creeky.   Cocktail list is great! A large list of handcrafted cocktails with fresh ingredients. Hubby drinks Moscow Mules, and so our kids have taken to ginger ale + lime as a drink. Indigo served up a great N/A ginger beer plus lime for the kids, no Seagrams! Wine list is extensive and wonderful. Rombauer chardonnay by the glass = YES, please! We also enjoyed a Stags Leap red blend by the glass. Wine people need not be worried about the wine options at Indigo.   We started with a prosciutto with pulled mozzarella (basically a caprese) which was a great starter. My kids are foodies, and typical kids menus don't cut it for them. My older now always orders off adult menus because of the lack of options. Off the kids menu: One shrimp fettuccine pasta with cream sauce. Shrimp was large, flavorful... an awesome kids dish. Perfect! For the rest of us, we had the Ling (cod, kind of like halibut) on a bed of broccolette, lobster ravioli (so rich!) with a lobster tail, and the airline chicken. The ling was cooked perfectly, wonderously as was everything we ordered.   We had the flourless chocolate cake with a raspberry sauce for dessert and it was awesome as well! So good with the last of the Stags Leap red blend we had. Julio was our waiter, and he was on point and delivered exceptionally good service and great suggestions on ordering, questions, etc. He was awesome and was always there when we needed him. I freak out (not literally, I just get a little sad) when I get my dinner arrives and - GASP - my first glass of wine is gone. Julio timed my wine perfectly, and made sure my Rombauer was there before the perfectly prepared Ling was delivered.   We will definitely be back and look forward to a menu that changes occasionally (it was changed since our initial visits -- so please continue doing that!) so we can return as regulars and enjoy different meals and experiences."}
{"text":"Had dinner there totally amazing. Food was out of this world. Kristina the exec chef knows what she is putting together. Next time I am in town it's my new go to restaurant."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. We went on a Wednesday night, there were hardly any other guests and it still took almost five minutes for our server to acknowledge us. When we finally got our food, we were incredibly disappointed. The portions were small and the prices are steep. We were still hungry after we ate but we didn't want to waste anymore time or money so we left and went elsewhere for some food to fill us up. We will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"The scallops and homemade noodles were very good. The best part was our server! I don't recall her name but she was awesome."}
{"text":"Great place to go any night of the week, lots of seating choices inside and out, upstairs and down stairs.  Good service and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Very creative and endemic cocktails fit for a curious tourist's expectations.  We tried the cowboy kicker which includes Amaro mixed with cardamom and whiskey... Next level! Very cowboy-chic. ;-).  The Creeker which includes the house's chile-infused Aperol mixed with apricot liquor, lemon and a few other ingredients is amazing and unique.  And that's just the cocktails. We are on to appetizers and they have delighted.  Our bartender Joe was clearly meant to be in the industry. Passionate about his craft. So we highly recommend.  If you're looking for a modern take on rustic AZ , this is your spot."}
{"text":"Great new spot in cave creek!! 2 stories with an open kitchen and large bar. I had the duck and my wife had the ahi. They do a nice happy hour with good apps and drink specials. Becky at the bar is a blast.  I had the tequila drink with jalapeños. Really good. Great bar staff. Very pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Ahi tuna was the best I ever had. Nice atmosphere too. Friendly staff. They also offer many good wines however they could have more in stock."}
{"text":"The food here was fabulous. Everything came out cooked to perfection. Ambience is great! This place looks fabulous. Stagecoach really needed some type of life in there.   Waitstaff was great never needed to ask for another refill my glass was topped off"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch there yesterday on a Sunday. They were a little overwhelmed because of the Art Fest but the food was great. Observed a few impatient people but we got a free round of beers and apologies for slow service. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Fantastic happy Hour!! Great service..  Get the carrot cake:)- trust me - it was to die for!  Beautiful views from the upstairs patio. We  can't wait to return!  From appetizers to the beet salad to our entrées this meal was phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! I don't live close and was in the area, well worth the drive back. One of my new favorite spots up North!!!"}
{"text":"Nous avons été invité par des amis et c'était notre première visite. Nous avons adoré l'endroit. J'ai mangé le \"airline chicken\"...un pur délice. La sauce est incroyable avec un soupçon d'estragon.  Mon conjoint a pris le \" ahi tuna\" et c'était le meilleur thon qu'il ait mangé à ce jour.  Les garnitures dans les assiettes sont parfaites. Une belle sélection de vins au verres. Le service a été impeccable et surtout on ne se fait pas pousser dans le dos."}
{"text":"Do not go. Stay away. Very nice decor and ambience. Very hard-working bartenders. The young manager is an arrogant fool. Destroyed any chance of a pleasant evening. Will never ever go back. Fire that manager."}
{"text":"Fabulous service beautiful place lovely location and wonderful food! The garlic bread is so yummy but if you don't like garlic just look for the whole cloves and avoid them. Prawns are excellent sea bass salmon and mussels excellent. Nice portions too! Ok so We normally do not have dessert but our waitress Lanore  said that we had to at least hear the list because they have an in house pastry chef. Well we went for it and the choc blueberry deal was awesome but the key lime pie was truly excellent! We are so full but so happy"}
{"text":"We chose Indigo Crow as an alternative to driving all the way back in to the valley for a good meal. Success!! The food, service, and ambience were top notch. I had the Lobster Ravioli and my boyfriend had the filet. We shared a charred romaine salad. All of it was perfectly prepared and plentiful. Our server, William, was very knowledgable and attentive."}
{"text":"We were here on a Saturday night. All the other places that were not saloon type eateries were over run with prom tourists. This place was accommodating and comfortable. We decided to sit at the bar where the bartender Jaime took good care of us. He really sells that menu! He knows it and really makes everything sound so good! He was quite busy without much assistance from food runners or busboys but managed to keep everyone happy!  The beer selection was specialized and unique. It was really interesting to hear which beers were from where and their alcohol content percentage and what makes each interesting. Again, Jaimie was working his hospitality magic. Its so nice to be waited on by someone who understands customer service,  The food was like the beer selection- creative, individualized and unique. We chose a pound of steamed shrimp, the tacos and the beef Brussels sprout skewers.   We will for sure return to try the surf and turf. Really something for everyone but not quite like anything you've had before. Thanks for a very special dinner out. Its such a relief to go out and not run into problems when you just want to relax, have fun and be taken care of for night."}
{"text":"Killer happy hour! Great food and staff.  Happy to have another option in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is below the Creekers in cave creek. Have had the tacos that were also very good, but came on a Monday and Creekers were closed ... so sad. Indigo Crow is owned by the same people!!! Shrimp scampi, truffle fries, beef and brussels.... can't say enough. Owner Jaime is the best!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place because of the favorable early buzz. We were seated at one of the two chef's booths which face the kitchen. Watching the food being prepared was both fun and interesting. We ordered a bottle a wine and looked around at the restaurant. It is nicely decorated with a hip metro look. Jackie was our server, who was very pleasant and fun. I ordered the chicken & risotto, which was outstanding! Don, the owner stopped by. It is obvious that he only hires the staff that share his outgoing personality, as he made us feel most welcome. Don't miss this one!"}
{"text":"I didn't review the second time we went because another expensive disappointment, so why repeat, but...  I had commented that our previous two visits to Indigo Crow had been very disappointing and we would not go there again, but others told us there are new owners and we should give it one more chance. So we went last night. Well....as my husband said afterwards: we could not find a thing to complain about! (And we are notoriously picky!) Okay, DH said his dinner was just a touch cooler than he would have wished, but my shrimp risotto dish was off the charts and our server, Lenore, was EXCELLENT! We started with this incredible grilled romaine salad and finished with a delicious chocolate cake topped with flan. Well, we ate half of it and I am going to have the rest for breakfast, maybe.   Thank you for a lovely meal, Indigo Crow!"}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour.  The bartender is super friendly and knows how to make drinks.  You tell he is passionate about his job and it shows!  We ordered brussels, beef tenderloin and Mexican corn on cob appetizers.  All were good.  The food prices for happy hour are great.  Lots of parking nearby."}
{"text":"First time to this place, and we live up in Cave Creek - all the fan fare is 30 seconds down the street, but you have to give it a try.  Food is outrageous - lamb burger was the best I have ever had, anywhere, no kidding. Fish and chips for the wife were phenominal and the fries were awesome.  Their own beer on tap - get the Irish red.  Staff was great.  Jamie upstairs was helpful but not pushy.  Just relaxed atmosphere with great views.  Cool that the downstairs is higher end with steaks and seafood, and upstairs is pub but very quality chow like fish and lobster boils down to pretzel boards and salads.  You gotta try it - not cheap but value for what you get is off the charts."}
{"text":"The restaurant seemed nice and the reviews were good. I actually visited the restaurant at the recommendation of a relative. I was so excited to try this restaurant and sadly I was let down on so many levels. The wait staff was excellent but I am not exactly sure what happened in the kitchen. I ordered the rack of lamb and ordered it medium however it came out just seared on the outside and raw on the inside. My cousin ordered the Filet black and blue and checked first to make sure that they would be able to do that. They of course said yes but brought her stake out medium. I sent my rack of lamb back and when they brought it back to me, half of it was cooked medium and the other half was still raw on the inside. In addition the risotto I ate had whole cloves of garlic in it that I consumed. When we complained again to the waiter, he apologized and informed the manager of the situation. He asked us if we wanted to order desert and said that they had a good flourless chocolate cake that was like fudge. The chocolate cake honestly had a chalk-like texture and we did not finish it. There was just insult upon insult. To add to that, the only thing the restaurant was willing to do was to comp our horrible dessert. I was not looking for them to comp any of our meal. What I did expect was for the manager to step out and speak to us and own up to the awful food that his kitchen served to us that day. I can't in good conscience ever recommend this restaurant to another person."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our food and service last-night.  Ambiance was nice plus their key lime pie was the best way to end our meal."}
{"text":"Initially our group of 4 was seated at one of the booths towards the back.   The booth felt very cramped for 4 people so we asked to be moved and they put us at one of the larger tables with a view into the kitchen.  Much better!  The restaurant has a beautiful interior with a lot of colorful art work (for sale).   Service was friendly and efficient.  We asked our waiter for recommendations which he gave with a lot of enthusiasm and we ended up taking some of his suggestions.   Not all of them were successful.     We started with the Serrano & Pulled Mozzarella.  The Serrano is more of a garnish (i.e. not much of it) but the flavors were good.   To try something different I ordered the Charred Romaine - not a fan of smoky lettuce it turns out.   We also had some Mussels (enjoyed) and the Baby Green Salad which was good.      Entrees:   Rack of Lamb (very good), Trout Special (very good) and the Risotto with scallops and added shrimp (good seafood but risotto itself was not enjoyed).  Dessert:   Key Lime Pie (very good), Carrot Cake (ugh - far too dense, odd texture and not enough frosting).  We will be back to try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Wonderful staff.  Go for happy hour and try the Brie and Truffle Flatbread."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nicely decorated and offers a very pleasant dining atmosphere.  The meals are pricey and seem to be way overpriced.  The sea bass was $49 and portion was small , a salad was $24, and the lamb was $39 and not enough to justify these prices.  I think we would come back if the prices were more in line with the meal offered.  The yelp review showed two dollar signs when in fact it should be 4!"}
{"text":"Happy hour at the Indigo Crow has to be one of the best I have ever experienced! Appetizers are half price and we tried 3 of them -Wild Mushroom and Truffle Flatbread, Mexican Street Corn and \"Pig Wings\"- and left room for the Tres Leche cake for a shared dessert! 3 drinks and all that for $50, a good deal.   Best part, everything was delicious. Make sure you like balsamic vinegar if you order the flatbread. The cheese with the corn was a bit salty but the grilled corn made up for it. Pig wings were 3 pork shanks, with crispy medium/hot wing coating and meat falling off the bone. Flavorful potatoes with lobster cream sauce (!) balanced the spiciness of the wings. Bob was a great bartender and helped us decide what to order. Yum, we will be returning for a special dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful date night here. Great wine list. Delicious food. Great addition to Cave Creek."}
{"text":"FABULOUS PORK CHOPS...my husband and I were told how good these were and we tried  them and they were fantastic.  The salads are wonderful..only wish they had more vegetarian dishes!!  Will be back...wait staff was great, love the building it is in..."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service.  Wild Mushroom Truffel Flatbread was incredibly tasty. Pork Chop was one of the most tender I've had.  If your looking for a good tequila based cocktail, order a glass of the Up In Smoke (good dessert drink!)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great food. Great place. Vegan options and fabulous wine list. Drinks that were spicy and fruity and fresh salads with wonderful fresh dressings.  Very nice experience."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went in for Happy Hour. Great options.  Mussels.........very good Steak Skewers.......delicious and tender Fired Green beans........yummy Flatbread.............delicious Our cocktails ...........fantastic The Bartenders were wonderful! I am beginning to think this is my favorite close to home spot!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tripped across this place while on our anniversary in the area.  We didn't know what to expect but were pleasantly surprise.  We had reservations for dinner but ended up doing happy hour instead.  We ordered 6 items and all were great.  We really enjoyed the steak and brussels sprout skewers.  The pig wings were a great take on an old favorite as well.  We will go again when we are in the area.  Compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and what a disaster.  The apps were quite good, and we were looking forward to the main courses.  When my husband specifically asked the server if the Parmesan Shrimp Risotto contained mushrooms in the vegetables, the server consulted the kitchen and returned to say that there were no mushrooms in the dish.  Mushrooms are the one thing my husband cannot eat.  When the dish arrived, it contained many mushrooms.  After complaining to the server, he asked for the Sea Bass special instead.  He waited as the rest of us ate our mains, and finally the sea bass arrived.  Unfortunately  the fish was barely cooked.  Not even close. So raw it was difficult to cut.  Too late to order yet another dish, and a very hungry and angry husband was the result.  Really spoiled what should have been a lovely evening. Only lukewarm apologies were offered. Surprisingly, no attempt to make us happy in any way.  Needless to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an amazing experience while dining here. The decor was beautiful, the live music was superb and the dinner and drinks capped off a perfect night. We started off with Pig Wings and they did not disappoint. It was a perfect balance of smoke, spice and heat. After that, I had a Caesar salad and my wife had a beet salad. Both salads were delicious and very flavorful. We both ordered the same main entree of bone in Filet Mignon. It was cooked to perfection and paired well with the sides that accompanied it.   Their drink list is extensive and does not disappoint. Whether you love beer, wine or a unique cocktail, you won't go wrong here. After trying their Moscow Mule and Last Word, I salute the master mixologist who concocted these phenomenal beverages.   Indigo Crow is an absolute perfect place to take the one you love out for a wonderful dining experience. From the attentiveness of the staff, to the quality of the food and the inclusion of local flavor, this is a true gem in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"This fairly new opened restaurant is a good experience.  Went there for Happy Hour and found the menu to be varied.  We looked at the regular menu and thought it would be a good option for dinner.  There was a lot of wait staff so service was excellent.  Other wait staff spent their time tidying up and cleaning drink glasses.  A nice restaurant is needed in this area.  Plenty of parking available."}
{"text":"Love that there's a new dining option in the area and hope they are here to stay.  I might have given them 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that they need to work out some service kinks.  We went there to celebrate my husband's bday.  When I  made the reservations I stated this in the comments along with the fact that we would have a 1.5yr old with us and would need a high chair.  However, we were seated in a raised booth and their was no high chair ... just a booster seat.  We had to hold on to the babies legs to make sure she didn't slip off.  No one mentioned the birthday, so I made sure to mention it to the waiter.  The food is good.  We had the chipotle clams, charred romaine and lemon garlic prawns to start.  Everyone thought they were quite tasty.  The rack of lamb was cooked perfectly.  The lobster risotto was good, but very rich.  Another guest had the the seafood pasta and she seemed to enjoy it.  Two of us had the lobster ravioli.  It is not a traditional ravioli.  It is more like a sheet of pappardelle pasta wrap around a \"slab\" of ricotta.  Because there was so little pasta, I would say it was closer to gnudi than a ravioli.  The description says it was accompanied by a spicy cream sauce, but we didn't taste anything spicy at all. It was good, but a disappointment  because we were expecting the taste of more pasta.  Desserts were a chocolate cake, carrot cake and the apple puff pastry.  The carrot cake was the best.  The apple puff pastry was our least favorite.  The pastry was good, but the apples were sliced too thinly rendering them almost dry and their wasn't enough sauce to offset that.  We also didn't care for the cheese that it was garnished with.    Back to the service.  They really need to get there act together.  You could tell our waiter was  pretty \"green\".  He was very polite and he was trying really hard, but he would continually forget things.  He asked if we needed more bread and then forgot to bring it.  Someone asked for a cocktail and he forgot that too.  Food came up rather slowly too.  It was a Monday and the restaurant was maybe half full, so we couldn't figure out what the problem was.  We sat at a table facing the open kitchen and we think some orders were getting mixed up and servers were picking up orders that were supposed to go to other tables.  Lastly, as I said it was my husband's birthday.  There was no complimentary dessert!  We even sang \"Happy Birthday\", so it was like they didn't know.  Anyone hope they work out the service issues.  We would love to see them succeed."}
{"text":"Just went in for any old dinner last night and had not heard of Indigo Crow before.  Amazing food and service.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner around 6pm on Tuesday night.   We were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess and seated.   We then sat at our table for 10-12 minutes and were ignored by everyone else in the restaurant.  Nobody came by to take a drink order or even acknowledged us.  Didn't seem that busy but we didn't see anyone really helping other tables either.   So we got up and left.  Ain't nobody got time for that!"}
{"text":"Very nice decor-the food is almost as good as any high end restaurant.  The drinks are fantastic-could have a bigger beer selection.  Smoked Patron dessert drink - WOW!  But the prices are the issue-a little too high on everything..again I compare this place to a Maestros/capital grill or Wildfish...all of which I would say the food is better.  But if you want to pay the prices and stay in Cave Creek...your options are limited anyway."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience at Indigo Crow last night. Superb food and wine, and our waiter Bob was exceptional. Every one of his food and wine recommendations nailed it.  We had some Spanish wines that were incredibly priced."}
{"text":"The place was OK but the beer was flat and over priced and although we did not eat, the food odor was not pleasant. Meaning that if we had thought of eating there it was probably not going to happen. The Bartender was a bit arrogant. Considering the place was quite empty on a Friday evening speaks for the food quality and service for me. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give this restaurant one star is because the food was pretty good.  Although it took nearly 90 minutes to get our entrees. It was somewhat worth the wait.  The service however was less than decent.... Sorry to say this place is not going to last. It's really too bad because it has a great decor and prime location."}
{"text":"Took visitors there.  Menu eclectic.  Food was mediocre.  Waiter was OK.  Wouldn't recommend this restaurant.  Too expensive for what is provided."}
{"text":"As a vegan, I am accustomed to high end restaurants either having a vegan option on the menu or the chef is happy to prepare a vegan dish.  We looked at the menu and found not one dish that was remotely vegan or vegetarian for that matter. Odd in this day and age.  So we asked the very nice an accommodating waitress what she suggested. She went back and talked to the chef. The answer was \"salad\". The waitress was embarrassed and agreed to have another conversation with the chef.  I will say that we finally ended up with a great pasta meal after 3 conversations between the waitress and the chef, but we should not have to design a meal ourselves- the chef should be creative enough to come up with one.  And the chef never bothered to come out from the kitchen and speak with us.  Ambiance is good and service is good. But please expand your menu to accommodate vegetarians and vegans."}
{"text":"Ate here with a party of 14 the night before New Year's Eve. The owner was AMAZING.  We had such a good time.  Great food, great place, great service!  They really did everything they could to accommodate our crazy crowd. So appreciated everything that night."}
{"text":"We love this place and have been coming here for years. Today I met the best bartender named Bob. He knows the entire menu as well as bar drinks! So happy we me him! Come and visit you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite! Cave Creek has needed a place like this for a long time! Great owners and staff and the food rocks. The wine selection is exceptional! We will continue to go back over and over!"}
{"text":"Food was great!! Service was even better! We enjoyed our anniversary dinner very much.  Thank you Makayla"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner spot.  Delicious food and stellar service.  The pig wings were to die for.  The trout and filet were fantastic.  My boyfriend says it was the best trout he had ever eaten.  Our waiter Bob was awesome.  He anticipated our needs and gave us great service.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best happy hour offerings in town. The perfect blend of excellent food, great prices, and fantastic drink selection, makes it the best.  A few of our favorites include: beef and brussels sprouts skewers, ahi tuna and Brie en croute. The beef is nice and tender served on top of a bed of arugula lettuce cherry tomato and onion. The ahi is sashimi grade served on a plate with coleslaw wasabi and ginger. The brie is baked in a puff pastry topped with a sweet chutney, making this a fantastic dessert! This review is long overdue. They offer happy hour seven days a week are located in a really cute area of Cavecreek and it is definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Always our go to spot north of mi casa!  Bob has been our man consistently the last four years and tells you like it is!  So glad this place is here and maintains its quality."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My mom and I were in town for a wedding and stopped by 3 minutes before happy hour ended. They honored the half price apps which were already priced reasonably in the $12 to $20 range. We had tomato and mozzarella and ahi tuna to start followed by their chorizo mussels and filet and Brussels skewers. Portions are big but better yet the food is really really good. Service was outstanding! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 7 adults (all ages!) for dinner last night. Our waiter, Sam, made the evening extra special. His professional service, humor, and extremely patient manner, made everyone happy and comfortable. The meal was delicious as well. If every restaurant had more Sam's, they would be very lucky!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the 3rd night they were open - We started off with the Brie en Croute which was amazing, Lobster Ravioli was great with just the right amount of heat, gorgonzola topped filet for me - perfect med-rare w/great flavor.  We had a nice bottle of Cabernet and the ability to taste 3 desserts - I can't decide which I loved best - Key Lime Pie with Macadamia Crust , Chocolate Mousse Cake with Roasted Strawberry sauce or the Infamous Carrot Cake.  The pastry chef, Kelly Brinson, spent a few minutes with us talking about the desserts - Can't wait to go back and try more.  This is a very nice addition to the Cave Creek area - very refreshing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant with enormous portions. Hands down the best restaurant in the north valley. If you like Key Lime pie, it's better than we've had in the Keys.  Makayla, our server, made suggestions that blew us away. She will make your experience at the Indigo Crow that much better."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great well crafted signature cocktails. Lovely menu. Went for happy hour. Had small plates, shrimp, arugula in garlic wine sauce. Beets salad, mushroom fat bread. All scrumptious. Service excellent with smiles. Love to have different fare in this area, well prepared and plated."}
{"text":"Just had the best appetizer I have ever had.  It was Brusselsprout and beef skewers. Amazing!"}
{"text":"We love the cave creek area and really enjoy this lovely place. The setting is so nice and we can dine inside, outside and upstairs. There are views upstairs and a very nice environment.  The service is very friendly and service oriented. They know the menus and make killer drinks.  We were here for happy hour and enjoyed some the signature cocktails, beef and brussel sprouts kabob, street tacos, mushroom flatbread and lemon and garlic prawns. Lots of food and super good. We are coming back for steak for the full dinner. Nice addition to Cave Creek."}
{"text":"LOVED it!  Very cool atmosphere. Great furniture and decor.  The food was Delicious.  I had the flatbread appertizer without the meat and a salad.  Everyone at the table had something different, from  steak, to shrimp/clam appetizer and reported that everything was delicious.  I'm happy for cave creek to have this joint.  The shopping center seems cursed, nothing seems to stay long.  I hope they STAY!"}
{"text":"We had dinner on August 12, 2017.  Each had a couple of glasses  of wine. We ordered four different entrees, thinking we may share from each. Food quality was just Okay but the portions were rather skimpy.  Prices were $$$$.  2 couples, we had separate checks.  When I received my check there was an order of beef skewers @ $14.00 added that we never ordered.  When I questioned the server he said \" oh yeah thats right\"  I'll take it off the bill. Obviously, he knew it was added and thought maybe I would not notice.  Well, my wife and I dine out at least 5 nights a week and notice checks are deliberately padded about 35% of the time.  I guess many establishments think everyone is on a company expense account and really don't care how much they pay for dinner.  This is \"fraud\". Had I not been with friends, I would have made a scene.  It is unfortunate this kind of ripoff occurs much to often.  Lived in Arizona over twenty years and has continued throughout.  Very sad!! Never did I experience this thievery back east. Caveat Emptor!"}
{"text":"Delicious as always! One of my favorite reasonably priced meals in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. Don't waste your time and money. Was told our meal will be out in 20 minutes, then again in 10 minutes,  etc. This happened for an hour and 15 minutes! It was a joke.  Under-staffed and over rated!"}
{"text":"This is a review of their presentation this evening at the Taste of Cave Creek. Their booth had an incredibly misleading sample example (for lack of better terminology) at their booth. Five tickets was definitely on the high end for a sample, but when I saw the beautiful, thick, and generously sized piece of filet mignon sitting neatly on a pile of mashed potatoes, I thought, \"Now that's worth five tickets.\"  Unfortunately, what I was actually served was not worth five tickets. Instead of what they had displayed, I received a small, thin, oddly cut chunk of overcooked filet swimming in a bowl of soupy potatoes. The size of the piece I was served was at best 1/4 the size on display. How incredibly misleading. I was also not impressed with the flavor of anything in my bowl.    Now, I wouldn't normally expect to receive a fine filet mignon dinner for five dollars, but if you tell someone that's what you're serving, then by golly you'd better serve it.  Having felt totally lied to and like I wasted five of my tickets, I doubt I'll be visiting Indigo Crow anytime soon."}
{"text":"In a word, disappointed after the other reviews.  Like the location and general ambience and less noisy than we expected.    We went for dinner on a Saturday night with two friends. Wine list is good, but we were still waiting for the two bottles - one white and one red - that we ordered when the first shared appetizer arrived. Our friends' appetizer arrives about five minutes later.   I made a mistake ordering the seafood pasta which arrived overcooked in a non-descript industrial tomato sauce.  Not the worst $26 main course that I have had in the Scottsdale area, but far from the best.  Our friends liked the salmon and the filet.    We asked for bread and were told that the second plate would take 15 minutes to heat in the oven - this on a busy Saturday night,   It finally arrived when we had finished our main courses.  The waiter didn't seem to have the urgency that he might have shown."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Cave Creek.  This is a great venue.  The restaurant is laid out very nicely; decorated very stylishly and the menu is quite interesting and the service was great.  There were four of us and everything we ordered was delicious; plated beautifully and done to perfection.  Leave room for dessert...we ordered three different things and one was better than the next.  Our server knew the menu very well and this is definitely on our list to return. We live in the area year-round, so it is great to have this here."}
{"text":"I don't often provide a narrative, however, the food, service and atmosphere at this restaurant is 5 star!!  The beef and brussel sprout skewers - delish!  The Airline Chicken - stinking delish!!!!  Carrot Cake & Key Lime Pie - to die for.  I am in gastric heaven right now and can't wait to come back!!  Plan to come here for the live music in the lounge next time!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here. Probably should have done a little more 'research' before making it a 1st on Mother's Day.  The restaurant is very nice inside. Nice decor and very friendly staff. The restaurant advertised a special \"Mother's Day Brunch\". Now 'brunch' to me, means a combination of food that could be eaten for breakfast or lunch. It also doesn't mean 'buffet', although it can be.  Here's the bottom line. The food was OK. It was It was a breakfast buffet: eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, ham, fruit, yogurt parfaits & an omelette station. Kind of a disappointment, but OK. Then the bill came. $45 per person! With 4 soft drinks, the total was $215: for breakfast? That was really outrageous. Especially given the $$ legend here on Yelp and on OpenTable, list it as $30 or under.  Had it not been 'Mother's Day', I certainly would have had a conversation with the manager over the unpublished price."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 arrived on a Saturday night, with 6:30pm reservations.  The hostess proceeded to tell us that there was a full house tonight, and so entrees will take a while to come out.  She recommended that we order a bunch of appetizers in the meantime.  We all thought this was strange because first, shouldn't a restaurant be able to handle a busy night, second, there were empty tables on the ground floor, and three - she didn't even apologize for a possible delay in our orders.    Our waitress shows up to take our drink and appetizer orders.  The appetizers came out in a fairly short amount of time, but we had to wait over 15 minutes for our drinks.  Her explanation - the bartender is in training and so our specialty drinks take longer.  So, the restaurant has a busy night and they have a bartender in training working this evening?  Finally, there was no issue getting our entrees, but getting the table cleared of our dirty dishes took over 20 minutes (and two requests to the waitress).  After the table was cleared, we had to wait another 15 minutes for the check.  All in all, I won't go back.  The food was good, but definitely not worth the poor service."}
{"text":"We decided to try an new restaurant in town today and came upon Indigo Crow. Our first impression ......... lovely!! Loved the decor and the ambiance. Our waitress was friendly and accommodating. We followed her lead and ordered the Charred Romaine with blue cheese, Parmesan truffle fries and the Beef and Brussels sprouts skewers. What a disappointment. The presentation of two humongous lettuce halves on your plate with barely enough melted moody blue sauce left much to be desired.  Both the Beef and Brussel sprouts were undercooked and difficult to put a knife through  (despite the waitress being briefed on our desired doneness).  We would love to support our local businesses and will, in the future, enjoy their happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"Awesome Food!  Great Service!  The Ahi Tuna was divine!  The truffle fries were crazy good and the Arugula And Beet Salad was Delicious and Inspired!  We are coming back for Dinner!  This place is not VEGAN!  Just sayin..."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! It has a great Ambiance on the inside in the food is five star. Carlos is the owner and also the chef and his dishes are unique and flavorful. We don't live in Cave Creek but we are definitely going to drive out there to go to this place again. It is that good. I had the green chili burger and it was stuffed with delicious cheese and my husband had the tacos. I highly recommend both dishes. They also have really cool art on the walls that are made out of gemstones. If you are looking for a great meal this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Wanted a romantic evening out. The restaurant was well appointed. The menu selection was very good. My date ordered the lamb, when it was served to the table it was literally raw... not rare RAW! We asked them to take it back to be cooked properly. I felt terrible eating my meal while my date sat there. He didn't want my dish to get cold. Ten minutes late, my meal was finished and his was being served. I understand things happen, but they offered nothing to smooth over the inconvenience, not a discount or a desert. Not much of a romantic date if you can't even eat together."}
{"text":"Our dinner tonight we shared with friends at this restaurant was fabulous.  Each of our selections were delivered to our table with outstanding presentation and very delicious!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere great,food excellent,service great,best in Cave Creek,Carefree area,happy hour to die for."}
{"text":"A group (about 20) of us called ahead for happy hour. They accommodated us and even made sure that we could bring our 'dogs' (we were coming from an outdoor Art Fest and a few had theirs with) by seating us on the patio.   HH Food was Very good and there was enough variety for everyone. From sea food to Chorizo!  They also had several drink specials that were tasty and unusual.  Will need to stop by for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with beautiful art, food good to very good, although pretty slow kitchen on a Saturday night. Some food came out cold after a long wait. Our table of 6 was getting impatient, but our server Bethany was excellent, salvaging what could have been a bad experience. We'll be back due to great service."}
{"text":"If you like good drink and so so food. The fish was frozen 20 min before it was served to me. Very $$$$"}
{"text":"Found this fabulous place on Yelp. We tried it last evening for the Sunday all day happy hour. Wow. We were so pleased. Food was great, service was uber friendly. Our favorites were the \"pig\" wings and the truffle fries. But really - everything we had was excellent. Lemon garlic shrimp, beef brussels skewers, and yummy drinks. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed an amazing dinner here recently.  We started with mussels and shared a chopped salad. Both were tasty.  We both had the chef's special, which was Trout served with large shrimp over mash potatoes. It was well seasoned and delicious. The dish was also beautifully arranged on a wood plank. We have been here a number of times in the past, but this was by far, our best meal yet."}
{"text":"Kudos to the chef, the food was fabulous service however was terrible three hours to get our food mgr said we were the 7th table to complain. Asked why table next to us got served before us after arriving after U.S. He said they complained before us. Waiter was clueless never came back to check if we wanted drinks had to wait forever for even bread said oven could only make 3 at a time. The check came and totally wrong had food and drinks we never ordered aske for separate checks and got one! Then mixed up credit cards complete disaster!!! Too bad for the food when we finally got it was great. No desert menu, they recite it could not remember what he said. Carrot cake delisc"}
{"text":"Dinner at Indigo Crow...Had the Mojito Chicken, absolutely wonderful!! Great atmosphere, we loved the music. Sat out side on the patio and everything was really clean.  Great experience and will eat there again. Depending on the atmosphere you are looking for the music may be a little load inside but out on the patio it was perfect. Thanks Indigo for a nice dinner"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night, really hoping we would have another option in Cave Creek that wasn't a sports bar.  Place was packed - evidently lots of folks had the same idea.  So for the review...  First the Good - we were seated promptly and our waiter came over quickly to take drink order.  The wine list was fairly good and they had a nice selection of beers on tap.  The grilled romaine salad was fabulous!  Great flavor and plenty to share between the two of us.  The meats we ordered  (duck breast and ahi tuna) were cooked perfectly as ordered and the portions were generous without being overboard.  Now the not so good -- the noise level in this place was nearly overwhelming.  It was very difficult to hear our own conversation or our waiter.  Also, they seem to have a few too many tables crammed in the space.  We literally had to shimmy past a row of tables to get to ours.  The menu was not very inspired.  Basically standard grilled meats and a few pasta dishes with potatoes or rice, and two vegetable options, one if which was deep fried kale and carrots - not what we were expecting for a vegetable course.  Also, while our meats were cooked well, there was a lack of seasoning on everything (except the salad which was great). Pretty bland -- even the risotto.  After starting out well, the service slowed significantly and it took quite a while for our food and check to come to the table.  So overall, I'm not sure if I'd go back - perhaps once to see if they had any menu additions or did something about the flavors, but for the price you pay, I don't know that this place can compete with places like Cartwright's or Carefree Bistro or Venues - especially during the off season when the snowbirds and tourists go home."}
{"text":"Great incredible people work here! Wow we were treated like royalty! The food - interesting and awesome! The drinks - fun and frisky ! Loved it - will be back and soon!!'"}
{"text":"This place is great. Love the atmosphere, food is delicious, terrific wine list, and our waitress was amazing. We ate what she recommended and loved it! It is pricey, I would say $$$. I don't have a single complaint about this place."}
{"text":"Had a fun time at the bar for happy hour. Great prices! Sam, the bartender has a great personality & is alone worth the visit. Music by Kokoma rocked the place. The humus plate was delicious, but the fries were too greasy. Will definitely go back. Lovely atmosphere in Stagecoach Village"}
{"text":"Love going to Indigo. I hang out at the bar for appetizers and drinks when I go. They have a great selection of delicious appetizers and I can recommend everyone of them. Personally I did not experience one of their tasty sounding entrees yet, but did hear my friends say they absolutely loved it. The staff and ownership is friendly, funny and welcoming. The restaurant is kept clean and run professionally, what is important to me. The decor is modern and stylish. This privately owned local place is a wonderful addition to the Cave Creek area and a must try. A true local Gem!"}
{"text":"Yes!  My new favorite place in cave creek now! Beyond AMAZING food and every bite is so delicious!  Don and Regina have really put their heart and all efforts in providing cave creek with a nice fine dinning experience.  Our server was Ben and he was great and very knowledgeable!  We had the Catalina island salad, wow prefect salad.  The beef skewers very tasty and filed with flavor. Lobster Risotto was my favorite. And we ended it with the apple puff pastry desert. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Food was excellent but service was slow. They forgot to give one of us a fork and because our waiter didn't come by, we grabbed one from an empty table.  We asked for lemon for our water which was forgotten.   Food wise I would give them a 5 but the service was substandard which brought the score down"}
{"text":"Differently not 2 dollar signs more like 4. Lest expensive  item on menu is $26. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but sadly the service and food left us disappointed.  We don't have too many options in Cave Creek/Carefree, so I was hoping we'd have another eatery to add to our small neighborhood list.  We were seated promptly and then immediately greeted by our server to get drink orders.  First go around they were out of the beer my husband ordered along with my pinot grigio.  Server then comes back and said they were out of my husband's second selection of beer.  The server then says he hasn't been on the schedule a few days, so he didn't realize they were out of everything.  It's been awhile since I have worked in the service industry, but I thought the bartendars and/or manager would let their staff know what they have or were out of?  We started with the baby greens and arugula, spinach & golden beet salads - both were good, not out of this world.  Onto the entree... My husband ordered the filet and I had the ahi tuna.  The tuna just didn't taste or look fresh to me and the kale was so salty that it lingered in my mouth while taking another bite of the ahi tuna.  My husband said his steak was OK.  Server just seemed awkward and not knowledgable on the drink or dinner menu, so that didn't make the experience any better.   All in all, the place wasn't terrible, but don't think I will come back for dinner - maybe happy hour."}
{"text":"So disappointed in our experience tonight. Cool location and really nice space with a promising menu, so we expected more. We started with the Ahi tuna and fresh mozzarella appetizers. Both were average at best-- the mozzarella was definitely not \"fresh pulled\" as stated on the menu and the tuna was just bland. Kitchen service was so slow... 20 minutes for apps to arrive and then 45 minutes between first course and entree arrival. I had the filet, my husband had the ribeye and both of us agree that we have had better steak at home, purchased at Costco and grilled by us!! The ribeye literally tasted like A-1 sauce had been poured on it and the filet with green chilies and blue cheese was just \"okay\". To top it off-- we could see into the cook area/kitchen and could see the GM hanging out in the prep line eating!! He was literally stuffing either a chicken drumstick or lamb chop in his mouth in full view of customers! Sorry, we definitely won't be coming back and cannot recommend."}
{"text":"I hate to be so harsh because the service was lovely and the guitarist was good.  HOWEVER, the food was simply not very good.    1.  The BOUILLABAISSE ~ isn't a soup. It's a pasta dish?!   2.  The RISOTTO was uber, salty and had a weird Cajun flavor ...was also a wee bit clumpy   3.  Pork Chop.  I didn't try because I'm allergic to leeks.  Hubs said it was good.  My thought is it looked to soupy I'm a fan of seeing my food. I don't want a bowl of sauce...unless it's Bouillabaisse   4.  Lamb Chops ~ undercooked. I asked for Medium.  They were rare. I was also surprised that for $38 they only served two chops?!   The broccolini was salty.   The fries were very good.    Thus, the conclusion is order a cocktail and have fries.  Can't reco much else.  Sadly."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other night. The waitress was super nice and the service was very good. The food was good - I loved the carrot chips that came with my meal. My husband wasn't thrilled with the selection of food however. There isn't a burger on the menu or some simpler foods like he enjoys."}
{"text":"We had the most wonderful evening sitting at the patio bar. Katie & Brandon provided exceptional service. Can't beat the half price appetizers. The seared ahi was so yummy, we ordered twice!  Scallops, mussels and chorizo pasta were all delicious. My favorite was definitely the Gorgonzola mussels. Even the dipping sauce for the bread deserves a mention. Tastebuds very happy!!!"}
{"text":"We will return for the happy hour. Outstanding.  Half off all appetizers. I think our group of four tried most all of the appetizers and they were amazing.  Our waitress, Bethany, couldn't be any nicer she was friendly, helpful and spot on telling about all the beers and food.   The prices for dinner seemed a bit costly but if the food is as good as the appetizers it may be worth it."}
{"text":"The restaurant was almost empty on this Monday night. The service was very inattentive at first but as the meal progressed it improved. The arugula and beet salad was mostly greens. I chose the lobster ravioli and was very disappointed. It is not a ravioli. It resembles an enchilada as it has open ends and the filling is extremely heavy as it is all cheeses. A lobster tail is placed on the top of this concoction. The dish came highly recommended by the waiter. I also thought the wines by the glass were overpriced however they did have decent selections. As the meal progressed it begin to get warmer and warmer in the restaurant. It appears that because there were so few people in the restaurant they turned off the air conditioner. We asked that it be turned back on which they did. I do not think I will be returning to Indigo Crow."}
{"text":"A VERY disappointing dining experience at Indigo Crow. My husband, son and I went for an early Valentine's Dinner last night.  While our server was kind, attentive, accommodating and lovely...the rest of the experience was NOT.  First, they brought our entrees out before my husband and I were even half finished with our salads.  The woman running food to the table seemed genuinely surprised when we asked her to bring the entrees back to the kitchen.  Knowing that our pricey entrees were now being \"kept warm\" already had us feeling a bit uneasy.  Then, when we did taste our entrees it was utter disappointment.  My entree (shrimp and scallops with risotto) was SO SALTY I simply couldn't eat more than 4 bites of it. My husband's lamb dish was average at best.  Certainly not the type of flavor one would expect from this type of restaurant.  It tasted more like someone had put jam on a lamb chop and baked it.  His entree came with risotto as well and his was also WAY too salty.  Our server was nice enough to take my entree away and refund the amount on our bill.  However, my appetite was then completely lost after tasting so much salt.  I passed on ordering anything else.  I'd like to say that we may go back and try the restaurant again....maybe we will and I don't know.  As Cave Creek Locals, we were excited about the possibility of a new favorite place for \"fine dining\".....our search continues."}
