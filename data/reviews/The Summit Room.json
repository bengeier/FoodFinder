{"text":"The food is out of this world.  The cocktails are to die for.  The noise level is unacceptable.  I will only return if I get a table outside.  We were at the bar having dinner, we were screaming at each other."}
{"text":"Loved the food, atmosphere, and ambiance! We had the Fries with Lobster Gravy as a starter (superb) and I had the BBQ Shrimp with Corn pudding as my meal while my husband had the catch of the day (grouper). Both were delicious! Only reason I didn't give a 5 star review was we entered the restaurant at 6:05p and there was no one at any of the tables. When asked if we had a reservation (which we did not) we were told all the tables were reserved for later that evening and could wait or sit at the bar. There were only 2 seats at the bar so we decided to sit there. Before we left around 7:15, there were still more than half the restaurant tables empty...hmmm...otherwise everyone was very nice and courteous! Will eat here again, but maybe get reservations for a table next time."}
{"text":"Very cool place with rustic, lodge-like decor but with a modern take.   Drinks are fantastic and unique but can be a bit pricey. Food is well prepared, portions are good sizes, and there are plenty of vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options.   Bar and wait staff are knowledgeable and caring (we recently had Jennifer wait on us, she is really good)."}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: Superb cocktails and starters make this oh, so close to a 5-star restaurant.  I have been to the Summit room twice. Once with my better half and the other with a larger party. On both occasions the drinks and starters were excellent. On the latter of the two visits, that was sort of the problem.... the starters we so good that we just kept ordering more and had to raise the white flag before reaching the entrees. Both times service was excellent and suggestions from the bar were spot on.  Why no fifth star? The problem is that the mains just don't quite live up to the standard of the starters, those unreal cheese scones (of which I could have scoffed down a basket full) and the cocktails. Yes, I'm picking at little details but the Summit Room is up to the challenge.  Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Loved our first experience here - intimate and small, but attention to detail in the decor was great.  The story behind the concept and the furniture in the restaurant was so cool to read about.  Service was impeccable - they thought our entree was taking too long (we didn't)...and gave us a free soup to share.  Never felt rushed - loved just sitting and relaxing instead of feeling like we needed to pay our bill and get up to leave.  Food was delicious - BBQ shrimp are phenomenal, the duck was the best I've had in any CLT restaurant.  Our only complaint was we wish there were more rocking chairs on their front porch - we would've loved to have grabbed a couple and stayed for another drink but they were all full.  Also, we had a front table so the noise wasn't too loud but I can imagine further back it would be quite loud.  Can't wait to go back - don't miss out on this one!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice.  The first time was spectacular, but the second time was very, very average.  With all the good places to eat in Dilworth and South End area, I doubt I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Not much too say other than this is one of our favorite neighborhood spots.  Scott makes amazing drinks at the bar and always takes superb care of us.  Always fresh food, frequent menu changes, service with a smile - zero pretense!  A welcome addition to Dilworth, hope they stick around for a long time."}
{"text":"Great food and wines. But even if you want a craft beer they have a great selection of local and regional breweries.  Their oysters are fantastic and if you save room the donuts are to die for."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times sat at the bar and had exceptional cocktails, food and service. It can get a little loud at times but it's not a deal breaker.  This last visit I tried their signature BBQ shrimp dish - it was perfectly seasoned & charred, very juicy. I loved the honey peach bourbon julep (this might be a seasonal drink?) paired with the shrimp. Bartenders are attentive and knowledgable about their menu. Food comes out fast. Small parking lot tucked in the back. Plenty of patio space too with cute little rockers to enjoy the weather and your company."}
{"text":"Great decor but interior seating becomes very loud once the place starts to fill up! The sides (fried okra and fried potatoes and onions) were the best part of the meal. Ribeye was seasoned with too much salt and too fatty! Maybe not the ribeye's fault as I tend to gravitate toward fillet and they did not have that on the menu. Fried chicken was mediocre at best compared to the same at other restaurants in town, i.e Carpe Diem. Great attentive service! Quick turnaround on the meal. Would not recommend the banana pudding dessert as their recipe is sour and not sweet!"}
{"text":"Great new place.  It's been open for 2 weeks. It's a little small but it's great. I had the pork belly with cornbread mac & cheese... amazing.  I usually try mac and cheese wherever I see it and this was top notch. I sat at the bar since I was alone and Jim took excellent care of me. They have food and drink you don't see everywhere. If that isn't enough, the owner is involved with underprivileged kids. Go try it before the line is out the door."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!! We came for starters and got alot more. The tapas plates are fabulous. The following are must haves: shrimp, Brussel sprouts and the macaroni. There was not a bad option on the menu. The drink section of specialty cocktails is phenomenal. There's a warm fireplace that takes the ambiance up a notch if you're seated near it."}
{"text":"Yet another Yelp business I wish I could review with 3.5 stars. Came here on a nice summer night, busy crowd. We sat at the bar and got decent service from a busy bartender.  The craft Cocktails were awesome, beer was cold!  I would recommend this place to grab a drink and maybe an app, but might look elsewhere for dinner.  We weren't too impressed with the entree (we got the Cornish game hen featured special) and it was a little bit of a let down, but the drinks and the flatbread appetizer saved this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here three more times since they have opened and I have experienced much better service and the food quality has improved greatly. I love their cocktails. The menu is pretty dairy heavy, but they accommodating for food allergies. Great place overall, I am happy I tried them out again."}
{"text":"\"Average Food...Too Noisy\" Decided to check this place out for restaurant week. Not sure they want their customers to linger after dinner, especially with the hard seats. Its also very noisy and difficult to carry on a conversation. The empanadas were bland. The fish entree dish was plentiful but was also bland. I forget what I had for dessert, therefore, it must not have been too memorable. Better places to eat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I felt the service was a little slow. We had the muscles, empanadas, and bbq shrimp. We honestly felt the muscles lacked flavor. Eating outside was nice, but nothing was really memorable. I would rather give 2 1/2 but will give the benefit."}
{"text":"Very cool place, upscale, trendy yet friendly and neighborhood vibe is all over the place. You never had collards or brussel sprouts like this in Mom's kitchen. Every item has an adventure dining twist. Lots of options if you want to snack and drink or have a major meal. Service was a little slow but the ambiance was relaxed so it didn't matter. They never mentioned desert or a desert menu so I guess they don't serve it.  Like the Dilworth neighborhood it resides in it is waaaay more expensive than it looks or feels. Surised a place this trendy wasn't on Open Table, figured they didn't take reservations. Turns out they do, they were booked.They mentioned some service I never heard of or to just call them. Pretty prehistoric for such a trendy place.THose things aside, a real winner. Best new place in town just has Saturday night prices  with a Tuesday night ambiance. Get over it and enjoy, that's why we work."}
{"text":"First of all, the cheese scones are addictive!!!!!  I would go back just for those!  For dinner, three of us shared the Shrimp Banh Mi Sliders, Country Ham Flatbread and Sweet Potato Empanadas.  For dessert, we got the Pumpkin Cheesecake and Cookie Pie.  All were lovely!  I would definitely go back for the food.  BUT the noise level was incredibly high.  We were shouting at each other across the table.  The service was very attentive - our water (with cucumber!!) glasses were constantly filled."}
{"text":"Where do I begin, I would go there, just for the corn pudding that comes with the corn dusted trout, which is always  perfectly fried, the fish that is!  The Mt. Vinson is a twist on a Moscow mule and its a hit every time.  They seem to be booked out by Wed for reservations for the weekend, so make plans early.  Although I must say,  I get a table every time."}
{"text":"This place has amazing drinks. Hands down. Always has local beer on tap and in package, amazing mixed drinks, great wine and liquor selection. The food is a very good mix of southern fusion and old favs. Every time I come here they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Sitting at the porch is the best part. My husband, my dog and I are regulars. We found this place very cozy. The rocking chairs and the decor are just lovely.  The food is really good, we normally eat tapas and have local beer.  We tried the hamburger once and it was delicious! The services is fantastic, the staff and management are very friendly.  Definitely a great place to eat and have a drink! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Remarkable. This evening my husband and I dined at The Summit Room and it was such an enjoyable and worthwhile experience. Our server Elijah was one of the best we have ever had. His recommendations were on point and he made us feel right at home, very attentive and personable. The passion bubbly is perfect for summer and the beet devil eggs were great to share. The BBQ shrimp are by far our most favorite. Thanks to such hospitable service we will be back very soon!! 5 stars, for sure."}
{"text":"Came here Thursday night with friends for a dinner/date night.  We had the bahn mi sliders for an appetizer and the stuffed cod as a main course (split with the bf).  In all the food was good but a bit over priced. For example the sliders were pretty small and there were just 3..for $14 not worth it what so ever.  Out of the two the stuffed cod was my favorite.  The fish tasted fresh and the presentation was very creative.  I would definitely be coming back but probably just to the bar. The cocktails here are pretty solid as well."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night for the first time. The menu is good and has some unique items, and the food was good overall but lacked flavor. The staff was nice and polite. The overall layout and ambiance is poor. I would go to one of my other favorites in Charlotte next time, rather than returning here."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this restaurant! It took 3 hours to get our food, which was not cooked. The restaurant took on too many guests and the food was often served at the wrong tables. The staff was not attentive and often we didn't even have water! Really over priced and bad service."}
{"text":"Mac n cheese and outside seating were the best parts!   Scones -  taste like warm soft cheeseits. (their version of bread)     Mac n cheese - OMG, so good! Made of real cheese! Can't go wrong!! Cooked to perfection. Enough for dinner!   French Fries-  Very Good!!  Fish-  My friend said it was Increadible!!   Hummus- ok Hummus,  the pickled veggies weren't for me, but my friend loved them.    Mushroom pizza - I'd skip it   Beverages.. GIN A TONIC & VODKA TONIC  - week, but tasty WATER -cucumber water, good"}
{"text":"I went to The Summit Room for the first time this past Friday with a friend and it was a completely delightful experience from start to finish.  My friend got us a reservation so we were seated promptly after we arrived. We were seated next to the fireplace and the overall ambiance was very enjoyable. Our waitress was extremely nice and helpful with going through the menu. She recommended the BBQ Chicken Flat Bread, which I ordered and it was delicious. My wine was also very good. I will say, the place isn't cheap but the quality of the experience was worth it.  I will definitely be back to try the Cornbread Mac n Cheese, Deviled Eggs and Fried Green Tomatoes!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a while. Great addition to the food scene in CLT. Great atmosphere and amazing food. The menu changes from what I understand but the cheese plate was great and mussels were so flavorful. Also, a great cocktail menu! The service was on point and attentive without being too much, they were all very knowledgeable about the food & beverages. Definitely adding it to my rotation."}
{"text":"Holy sweet potato empanada!   So, I finally went to try The Summit Room out and I ended up back there three days later because i just HAD to have more sweet potato empanadas. (Get them, I swear, you'll be happy).   I like the vibe of this place, nice but not stuffy, good crowd, nice wait staff. It wouldn't break my heart if it was a little bigger, I went on a Saturday at first and it feels pretty packed pretty quickly.   Now, food. In my two visits I feel like I've already had a good amount of food from here. Clearly I love the empanadas. The mussels were fantastic, the broth was so delicious, right amount, tasty garlic bread - officially in the running for my favorite mussels in town. The Pork Belly/Shrimp Sliders - very very good, fun flavors, a little small. I get the slider thing but the second time we ordered them, I felt like all I was eating was bread and I was a bit disappointed. They are fantastic though and a must try. We also tried the Summit burger, it was good, simple, a very good amount of burger, tasty - If I wanted a burger, I wouldn't hesitate to eat theirs. We also had the brussels sprouts - these were delicious. A little maple and buttery and I ate them all in just a few bites. Great side dish to a meal. Finally we had the Uno Alla Volta Burrata - yes, please, get it! It was so fresh and so fantastic - I only wished there was more. If you like mozzarella, you have to try this dish, it melts right on the plate and in your mouth. Only thing with the cheese is that I wish it came with bread, so much so that I was really surprised and confused that it didn't and asked our waitress for some.   All in all, I have really enjoyed my food at Summit Room so far and I look forward to trying a few more plates. The only thing that's keeping me from 5 stars is that I do think it's a bit overpriced. I feel like these plates could easily all start $5-8 lower. Either way, I will be back for my empanadas."}
{"text":"We have been sitting outside summit room for a couple Fridays in a row now and love it.  With the string lights and the great service it's a perfect date spot or a great place to get a bite with friends.  Cocktail menu is on point too!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte  from Chicago, picked this restaurant as it was rated one of the best in a google search. Hands down, THE BEST restaurant we've ever been to.  Revolutionary & orgasmic flavors. The cornbread & collards will change your life. Staff extremely friendly & knowledgable; helpful and spot on with selections. Beautiful food presentation, reasonably priced.  Amazing wine, cocktail, and beer selection."}
{"text":"Wow!  Where do I begin?  I've been here before but it was for drinks and a cheese plate.  This last time I visited the restaurant, I hosted a mini-fellas night out.  The food, ambiance, and drinks were amazing!  I can't leave without saying just how well attentive and hospitable the staff is here.  I'm referring to the Front of House to Back of House, everyone completely blew us away with their service.  Enjoyed Summit Room so much that I went back the next evening for dinner and drinks with friends.  It seemed as someone had hit the \"repeat\" button because I received the EXACT same great service.  I highly recommend this restaurant! Oh and ask for Bo....he'll take care of you!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Charlotte!  I have lived in Charlotte all of my life and tried just about every restaurant in town.  As far as food goes, this and sol gastrolounge are my two favorites.  Summit Room sets itself apart with its exceptional cocktails (seriously, best in town by far.. I don't have a 2nd favorite cocktail spot) and friendly staff.  The waitress was very helpful and even gave us a list of \"dive\" restaurants to try in Charlotte.  Fidel is another reason I will be going back.  He always greets everyone with cheer and remembers you by name.  Try this place!!  Pro tip: get the honey crisp apple old fashioned and the brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Cool spot - neat atmosphere and very relaxed. Drinks are 'okay' and have only had a few apps to eat. Everything is 'A-OK' except for the service which is lacking. On three separate visits, the far left room has been empty and the hostess refuses to allow us to sit on the couch and have a drink. The dining room has been half full at most, but they want us to wait '45 mins to an hour' for a table."}
{"text":"One thing that put me off initially about The Summit Room is that no one answers the phone when you call - there is an automatic recording and no option to speak to someone, only to leave a message. I was calling to follow up on a reservation I requested online (and never heard back about whether I had it or not) and I was disappointed I couldn't actually speak to someone before arriving at the restaurant.   As far as first impressions, it is a quaint space that they use well. The front patio is lively and the spot to be on a warm spring/summer night. All the seats were taken and there was a wait for the patio, so my husband and I grabbed a table inside. The cucumber water they serve in the stainless steel glasses was delicious. Hidden gem - it definitely helps keep you hydrated. They have an amazing, boastful cocktail list that is fun and intriguing - with names after different mountains, you get in a fun mindset about choosing your drink. I started with the Mt Vinson with titos vodka, vanilla bean syrup, ginger beer and a cinnamon sugar orange wheel. The drink was good (I sure do love ginger beer) but I honestly didn't get much of a vanilla taste, which is why I ordered the unique drink in the first place. My husband had the peach bourbon he said was just okay.  For the food, we started with the sweet potato and mushroom flatbread and added pork belly. I will tell you that what was served wasn't exactly the flatbread that I pictured. It was a lot more doughier than your typical thin and crispy flatbread, which was what we had in mind. It was pretty salty, and I was also hoping for more of a sweet potato taste (deceiving flatbread name). The gouda was delicious because who doesn't love a cheesy piece of dough? But that was probably the highlight of that dish for me.  We also tried the shrimp bahn mi sliders, which may have been my favorite plate. They are served on a baguette sliced into smaller sliders, with a shrimp pattie (DELICIOUS), topped with some pork belly. The jalapeno relish really gives that zing of spice that takes over your taste buds, but it's a nice accompaniment to the sliders. I actually think it goes well with the flavors! I wasn't overly impressed with the pork belly - I think they were a little too crisp and not very flavorful.  Pro tip - the Mac n Cheese is a huge serving size. It could be a full meal. It comes with bacon (yum) and layers and layers of cheese - I would guess cheddar cheese. It comes served in a skillet so the cheese just melts throughout the dish. It is definitely very comforting, creamy and cheesy - all that you would want in a mac 'n cheese dish.  They definitely have a \"comfort\" food niche here - cornbread, mac n cheese, grits, collards, etc. available. I think it would be great to go with a group to split a variety of dishes, or just come for the cocktails. I think the food quality is average, but the atmosphere more than makes up for that. Service was a little slow. Overall, I'd give 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"So, I think this should really be 4.5 but I'll round up :). A newbie to the Charlotte restaurant scene, The Summit Room has jumped on the farmhouse-chic train with metal chairs, exposed wood beams, and antler mounts. It's a great vibe, perfect for a gals night out, a date, or happy hour. On the smallish side, cozy and a bit loud because of the close quarters. Cute, outdoor porch that overlooks East Blvd. and Dilworth. Yes, I suppose this place may be a little on the girly side.b  They have a list of 7 specialty cocktails that are all $11 and named after the seven summits--a cute touch I thought. I opted for beer and was happy to find a decent-sized list of local and regional craft brews. The menu consists of soups/salads, starters and share plates, and larger plates. They also provide mini cheesy scones in lieu of rolls. YUM!   We sampled the chicken flatbread ($12) with chimichurri grilled chicken, spinach goat cheese, confit oyster mushrooms, tomatoes, cilantro. DOUBLE YUM! Decent sized portion and a unique twist of flavors.  Next up the mussels. Lots of mussels. To be fair the mussels were definitely on the smaller size but they were perfectly cooked and delicious. Mussels came accompanied by toasted bread to dip in the buttery broth.  Lastly, to end on a sweet note, we ordered the creme brûlée which was served with fresh fruit and absolutely delectable.  One thing I wasn't impressed with was our server. A little slow, didn't seem to really know the menu, and mixed up the bill a few times. Not terrible, per say, but definitely not notable."}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice. We ordered the mussels and salads. Did not really enjoy either. Service was great. I feel it is overpriced for what it is. I prob won't go back for food."}
{"text":"Heard from a co worker that we needed to try The Summit Room, after looking at the menu online we decided to give it a shot.  Honestly, I was sold when I saw the Scallops A La Plancha served with carrot puree and pickled peach relish. Unfortunately upon arrival, I discovered it wasn't on the menu anymore. So just a bit of advice guys, update the menu on your website.  Entering the restaurant was a little awkward. Their is a small divide about 2 feet from the door which we thought was the host stand, but really is for privacy for low tables in the bar area. We entered at the same time as another party and the nice hostess was busy bussing tables at the time, so we were fairly cluttered and not sure where to stand (that would be out of the way.)  We sat at the bar while waiting on a table outside, bartenders were very friendly but not very up to date with what seasonal beers they had on tap.    Once seated outside we ordered some appetizers, nothing to brag about here. We tried one of the \"flatbreads\" only to get a small, four piece, doughy pizza. The taste was just ok, however, I would never order it again.  Overall, the aesthetics were pleasing, minus the mounted deer head and animal skulls, the patio area was nice, minus the roaches, and the service was fine. Bottom line, we were extremely disappointed with the food, which we had such high hopes for. Sorry Summit Room, we will not be returning to your establishment."}
{"text":"Awesome place to come!! Food is amazing, drinks are perfect!! Reasonably priced. I hope this place is around for a long time. It's our spot close to home.  The best part: they have a worker named Fidel, from Bolivia, the guy is amazing!! He greats you and has the most awesome personality. He is super friendly, one of the reasons we love coming here."}
{"text":"After reading excellent reviews of this place, we decided to give it a try. The food was excellent and the drinks were delicious. Unfortunately we had really horrible service. Our waiter routinely ignored us and went to other tables multiple times. We waited about 35 minutes for one of our courses. We wanted to like this place, but after the poor service, we will not return."}
{"text":"Man I love the Summit Room.  I mean it!  It's one of the few places you can go in Charlotte to get a serious, proper cocktail mixed for you, and boy-howdy do their drinks have some spunk to 'em!  (Disclaimer: don't drink and drive, you're smarter than that, and better looking, too!)  I will very likely keep going to the Summit Room regularly until I've tried one of all of their specialty cocktails -- which, while they do carry a relatively high price tag (I think it was around $11 or $12 for some), are easily potent enough to match 2 rum and cokes at your average bar/restaurant.  The food is delicious, creative, and extremely well presented.  It's just beautiful.  Again, the price is a bit higher than some of the other places in the area, but it is really worth the coin.  I wish I had the budget to go more often!  I'd happily recommend the scallops to anyone - you get a hearty portion, and they are cooked to perfection!    If you're not into seafood (and I'm not typically, in truth), ask the staff about their favorites - they've got lots of good things to say.  I'll leave you with one more thing - when you sit down, you'll be given an ice cold cucumber water in a frosty tin cup.  So sweet."}
{"text":"The service and food were AMAZING. We sat at the bar and the service and ambiance was perfect. my boyfriend and i split the kale salad large which was perfect  for two, the barbque  shrimp over corn hash. Outstanding!!! And for entree the salmon pecan crusted. Then desert was sweet potato Creme brûlée and cinnamon ice Cream and coffe and Bailee's ! Everything eas very good! We have gone to mayo bird many times now this gives us another reason to come this way!!!!!"}
{"text":"I remember when hitting east boulevard for grub used to be a little hit or miss, and more often than not meant you were grabbing something very casual. However, it has been fun to watch the aggressive expansion of fine dining options on this little strip of town. The Summit Room is one of these places that boasts fine eastern NC inspired eats with a stout cocktail list inspired by the seven summits (get it?).  We stopped in on a Thursday night that was one of those gorgeous 70° evenings, hoping to grab a seat on their surprisingly large outside patio. Apparently half of Charlotte had the same idea so we had no such luck. We did get placed near the window, but my one gripe about the place was how loud it could get inside. But let's move onto the meal.  We started off with a mixed drink each. I got the Aconcagua (a spicy, south american inspired drink) while my wife got the Kilimanjaro (Gin drink with a great balance of sweet and tangy). Both were right on the money. I would definitely go back just to try more of their signature cocktails. To divide and conquer the menu, we decided to split some appetizers and a main dish. We settled on the shrimp banh mi sliders, drunken mussels, and BBQ ribs. The drunken muscles were easily our favorite dish. They are cooked in local beer (OMB copper), which made a great sauce to dip in the provided sweet bread. Also the BBQ rib serving size was borderline ridiculous. Between the three dishes, we had almost too much food - but no complaints here about that!  Overall, The Summit Room is a great addition to the East Boulevard restaurant scene. I look forward to going back sometime soon."}
{"text":"So sad Bruegger's had to go...  Just kidding.. this place is really hip.  Dessert and drinks are tops here."}
{"text":"Appetizer - (Starter) Beet & Bean Salad, fresh, every veggie I love (minus the corn) - done, love it!!  Main dish - salmon w grapefruit slice & bubbles and garnish (good Lord) - yeah, it was awesome.  Drinks - (Starter) Pear Martini, (Main) Laguna Wine, (Dessert) Thin Mint. Ambience - chillax but upscale Service - hostess + Server (Jonathan, What's up!!) = My New Charlotte Spot - done. And I understand they do a mean breakfast??? Oh it's ON!!"}
{"text":"A long wait to get in, but worth it. I love the concept of different cocktails for different summits! My sister-in-law got the duck, and man, was I jealous! The tastes she shared with me were beyond delicious. So tender and rich. I got a corn salad that I think is no longer on the menu; it was good, but not mind-blowing. As for drinks, my husband got the Mount McKinley, which I thought was delicious. I got the Mount Everest, and it was absolutely great."}
{"text":"We popped in late for apps and drinks. This is a unique place because during the day the patio works for the Mayo Bird and you can get great lunch food but late hours, the shared patio works for The Summit Room which serves great small plates and yummy smart cocktails.   A very fun place to hang out with friends, enjoy beer, wine or speciality cocktails like, my favorite, the berry smash. On summer nights its especially nice to use the rocking chairs or sit on patio and enjoy the night air.  Yummy cornbread, cheesy scones, and salads."}
{"text":"I had a great experience with dinner here - the server was excellent, very personable, friendly and gave us some great dinner suggestions.  We had some of their signature mixed drinks, and the apple pie moonshine drink was simple amazing.  For dinner, we decided to have a sampling of their sharable dishes, we chose 4 of them and it was plenty for the two of us.  The atmosphere was nice, there is a small outdoor seating area that faces east blvd.  Overall, if you are looking for a nice place to have dinner or take a date, I highly recommend the Summit Room."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and character.  Would love to stop by there at 4:30 and sip a brew on the rocking chair on the front porch.  This place was hopping on a Saturday night with well dressed young people.  Lots of lively conversation and a diverse clientele.  Shane (reviewer 3/4/2017)was right on all the way around including the noise.  We had a beautiful evening and ate on the patio under the lights, the owner brought out a couple of blankets and lit the gas heaters.  So, why only three stars?  They just changed the menu and the offerings are a bit skimpy.  They were sold out of three of the appetizers and, for entre's there was a burger, salmon, lamb ribs, ratatouille and game hens.  Maybe they were short handed because the service and the food came out very slow.  Wish they'd given us a few more of the yummy \"cheese scones\" to hold us over for dinner.  Burgers were all ordered medium or medium rare and sadly, mine was so rare the meat was red and cool and inedible.  The fries were alittle tough and soggy, probably cooked in a large batch an hour before, and therefore didn't make up for the raw meat burger.  We sent it back, but it didn't come back out until everyone else was finished.  The ratatouille was good, but a bit skimpy for a veggie dish.  I hope this was an unusual evening because I'd really like to go back and try it again."}
{"text":"I have been lucky enough to eat at The Summit Room a few times.  I could eat there every night.  Chef Brent Martin is amazing and his staff never fails to impress.  I love the mussels and will gladly try anything that comes out of this kitchen"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were really good. Staff all friendly and courteous. But holy hell were the portions small for the price!!! The Cornish hen for $24 had 2 little Cornish hen drumsticks. I mean, I know a Cornish hen is small but for $24 I was expecting the whole hen! And on the menu it's listed as a \"Large Platter\". Again, really good food but I feel like we just got scammed!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the soup of the day and BBQ shrimp. The shrimp were amazing. My sister had the ham flatbread which was really good as well."}
{"text":"what a great place!! the service was top notch, the ambiance was perfect, and our server Andrew provided great recommendations.. the food was absolutely delicious especially the bbq shrimp and macaroni and cheese. I will most definitely be back to try more menu items and see Andrew :)"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but...  We ordered the lobster nachos and the burger. For $14 we received a small rectangular plate of approximately 10 neatly aligned nacho chips of which 3-4 had no toppings and all of which had scant amounts of lobster meat and were served cold; I suppose we were expecting a hot messy plate of nachos (regardless of how much lobster meat was included).  The burger was good but came with a bag of prepackaged chips for $14. For a place of this caliber and the price of the burger, we expected more than a bag of prepackaged chips as a side; especially with Bad Daddy's located across the street. Atmosphere and staff were great and I'm sure the rent is high on East Blvd. forcing them to increase food prices, but we were overall disappointed with the small portions and high prices."}
{"text":"great meal.  wanted to try kid cashew but the service was so bad we left.  good thing because summit room always is great.  every staff member says hello, explains the specials in detail, drinks and food are great and edgy."}
{"text":"The pork belly w/mac&cheese was amazing.  Each bite had depth & richness.  The mac & cheese flavor was a bit smoky & there was cornbread in the mac&cheese.  I would have loved a bit more cornbread to do I dare say it cut the richness of the mac&cheese w/the pork belly.  We will be returning!"}
{"text":"One of the best date night places in Charlotte. Casual but upscale with great menu. Perfect place to order shareable plates. Highlights are the barbecue shrimp (best dish in Charlotte I've had), cheese plate, and handmade cocktails."}
{"text":"The Summit Room will most certainly be a staple eatery of ours for the foreseeable future.  We've been twice now and have been very pleased with the entire place.  It's still a fairly new restaurant, so they are working through some kinks... but overall this is a place to add to your Charlotte bucket list.  The breakdown:  Environment: A++.  If it's nice out, try to get a space on the front porch or in the rocking chairs.  Decor is lovely, very industrial chic.  Hardwoods, white accents.  Music was on point.  The wait staff was very nice.  Food: The Kale Salad.  Just do that - every time.  The dressing, the kale, the garnish... DAMN.  It's one of those salads that makes you feel like you're not actually eating a salad.  The potato gnocchi is a great dish overall, not too large for those of us who feel guilty after eating an entire plate of pasta.  The cheddar scones rival any southern cheddar biscuit I've tasted.  What a delight.  The salmon was not my favorite, but still good.  The shrimp bahn mi sliders were great!  Warning, they come with a kick!  My one wish is that they add a few more entree options for those of us wanting to limit the carbs/meat intake.  Drinks: Give me that Chocolate Old Fashion EVERY DAY.  Sounds gross right?  Not at all!  They use handmade chocolate bitters and it's heavenly.  Served in a small snifter - perfect for bourbon fans.  My boyfriend got the pear martini and it was delicious!  Not at all what you would expect - light, summery, with a citrus finish.  Kinks: We went to dinner last night (Tuesday evening).  We pulled up and were ecstatic to see that there were a bunch of tables available outside.  When we walked in we asked for a table outside (there were three clean and one dirty that I saw) - the host quickly said no, that they were reserved and that he had people waiting for awhile.  No worries, he offered us two rocking chairs outside which was actually way better.  The funny part was that the tables remained unfilled the entire time we were there.  The wait staff seemed completely overwhelmed outside.  I give them a ton of credit because they were HUSTLING... but it took us awhile to get our drink orders and even longer for food.  I kind of had to pull our waitress aside to order rather than her asking us what we wanted.  Again, not a huge deal. We were completely content to sit outside and enjoy the weather and our drinks.  Overall: We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Drinks are good. Food is tasty but expect small portions. This is a better place for drinks and small plates rather than a huge dinner. Service is friendly. Kind of pricey..."}
{"text":"Yum! Is the word I would use to describe the food and drinks at this wonderful little Dilworth Gem!  Of course I discovered this place through Yelp and decided to give it a try with some friends who recently moved into town.  At first glance, the menu is easy to read and offers the right amount of variety without being overwhelming.    I like that menu is seasonal and that Chef Martin believes in using sustainable, local foods.  This gives you something new to look forward to whenever you visit.   The service was great.  We sat outside and were served ice cold cucumber water (Yum!).  After placing our orders for food and drinks,  we were served these AMAZING, soft and flavorful cheese scones.  I could eat those ALL DAY! We had a larger party, and our server was kind enough to get us another round of these delicious scones.    I started off with a perfectly made specialty cocktail: lemongrass-basil refresher.  I don't enjoy overly sweet drinks, and they made sure my drink was made to my liking.  It only had a hint of sweetness, along with the wonderful flavor of fresh basil and lemongrass.    The among the memorable dishes ordered by our party at that table were: the summit burger, skillet mac N cheese, house fries, the drunken mussels, BBQ chicken flat bread and the shrimp Banh mi sliders.   Each dish was delicious and cooked to the right temperature, and the portions were reasonable (not overly big but not too small).  The prices are definitely on the higher side, but the food and beverages are absolutely worth trying!   The Summit Room would not be my \"local\" joint or casual dining spot when I want to grab a quick bite, mostly because of the price point, but it is one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in the Charlotte area and is great for a special occasion.  I cannot comment on the ambience of the inside seating, but the decor was cute.  Outdoor seating is nice and great for groups.    I have several friends who are vegetarian, and will say that though the menu has a limited selection of \"veg friendly\" dishes, the ones they do have (at least currently) on the menu, sound very delicious.   I am looking forward to going back and trying another specialty cocktail with some delicious food soon!"}
{"text":"Attentive service. Edgy decor. Delicious brussel sprouts. Pork tenderloin dry, served cold/medium temperature. Small space and very loud.  I am glad I tried it, but would not return. I would not wait in line."}
{"text":"Blueberry smash drink was amazing! Nashville chicken sliders (without pickled cucumbers) were fabulous along with the house fries w/ parm. cheese"}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner and drinks. Love the decor! It's a pretty small setting so I recommend getting there early! Delicious dishes and wonderful cocktails."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great atmosphere and excellent selection of local beer. The food was delicious and I loved that our waiter was so passionate about the food. We love trying places that are unique to the area we are in and this hits the spot!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a cocktail and appetizer on the porch to enjoy the cooler weather this weekend. The service was excellent and attentive, even though we were having a full meal, something that isn't always the case at nice restaurants. The pimento cheese appetizer was amazing and went great with our drinks, which were unique and refreshing. Sitting in the rocking chairs on the porch and watching East Blvd was definitely a highlight of our weekend. I look forward to going back to try more of the food, I was also eyeing some delicious sounding desserts!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing some buzz about this place over the past few months and we decided to check it out.  It lived up to the hype!    The Summit Room is set in what looks like a big old house, and it shares space with this chicken salad place (???).  There is a really nice patio area out front and a big porch with rocking chairs where you can sit and enjoy a cocktail or three.  And you'll probably want three just so you can try as many of the interesting liquid concoctions as you can get down your gullet.  The Cucumber Collins is an excellent summer drink, a delicious twist on a Tom Collins.  Another nice option is the Chocolate Old Fashioned which is a cool take on the classic Bourbon drink.   The dining room is small, loud, and happenin'.  If you are looking for an intimate or romantic setting, don't go here.  It's hip and loud and energetic all around.  There are various animal skulls on the walls and a deer head mounted over a doorway - not sure how I feel about all that jazz but whatever I can deal with it for the delicious eats.  The grilled zucchini flatbread is money as an appetizer.  So is the now-famous BBQ shrimp appetizer that comes on a slab of corn pudding.  If you have all that PLUS the complementary cheese scones, you are already feeling pretty full.  But you have to hang in there for the main courses.  I had the duck which was really tasty - it came with blueberry grits and wilted spinach.  The wife got this huge piece of wild caught salmon.  Both were spot on.  We didn't have room for dessert after all that, but the desserts looked pretty tasty as well.  Summit Room is a cool spot with creative twists on some down-home Southern dishes!"}
{"text":"Highest Rating I have ever given anyone!!!! Drinks,Food,And Atmosphere are all 5*!!! Try all the Tapas and the Lemon Pie is just Perfect!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the vibes of The Summit Room! A must visit for anyone visiting or living in Charlotte.  I visited on a Friday evening with a friend and were seated immediately (only because they had a recent cancellation...lucky us!). Service was great, attentive and personable. Ambiance was cozy, modern and fun. Excellent place to come and enjoy a great meal with friends. A+ on both regards.  We started off with the bánh mì sliders and the BBQ Shrimp. First, the corn pudding served with the BBQ shrimp...delicious and savory. And the shrimp? Succulent. Sliders were crunchy and tasty - everything a pork belly sandwich should be.  I had the brie stuffed hen and was afraid that the brie would be too mild with chicken. Not at all. The chicken was perfectly roasted and juicy, making the Brie a perfect match. My friend ordered the duck - seared to perfection and the pickled blueberries topped it off. Mhmm.  For dessert, I ordered the caramel apple galette. OMG are my thoughts. How could the crust be more perfect than it was? Crunchy and fluffy but melt-in-your-mouth at the same time. And the caramel apples filling the middle? Pure decadent. My friend ordered the special: persimmon jam donut with chocolate creams. Another moist and rich dessert that was absolutely yummy.  Many cocktail and wine selections. Their cocktails are fun, tasty and unique.  Highly recommended. Good eats. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious cocktails. Attentive staff. Everything on the menu is tasty! Perfect place for a girls night"}
{"text":"Great Place food well made and they make good cocktails! Servers are really nice !!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for lite bites and cocktails. It was a short Uber ride from where we were staying downtown. The drinks were delicious; ordered a clementine negroni and was made with the freshest ingredients. As for food, ordered Brussels sprouts with lardon bits and Sriracha deviled eggs. Can't wait to come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Simply beautiful outdoor seating. Tuesday's 10$ off a bottles of wine. The Burger and fries were DELISH!!  Scale 0-5 Food- 4 Service - 4 (Had to send burger back/ requested well done) Drinks - 5  Overall - 4"}
{"text":"The cocktails were great, The waitress was funny, I know I'll go back, When it gets sunny."}
{"text":"I'm so rarely on the early end of a trendy restaurant that I feel pretty cool having visited The Summit Room just a month after they opened! It looks totally different than when it was Bruegger's - I can't speak to the Mayobird side, but I definitely felt like I was in a casual, trendy restaurant. A girlfriend and I went after work and got there right at 5:00 when they opened. We were only the second people in there, and we grabbed a seat at the bar.  The bar itself is awfully pretty... glass bottles as far as the eye can see and silver bar stools lend themselves to a very clean, modern feel without being sterile. There were maybe 12-14 seats at the bar, a few tables along the side, and a high, long table at the front near the front door. There's also a huge, inviting patio, but it was a little sweltering the night we were there. I also love the huge, private parking lot, which is a little rare on East Blvd.  Our bartender, Scott, was so fun and gave us honest recommendations on what to get. I think he got a little overwhelmed later in the evening, but I'm guessing they're just getting their footing. We opted to split the BBQ shrimp appetizer and chicken flat bread appetizer. The chicken flat bread came in four pieces, which were delicious if just a smidgen dry, and the BBQ shrimp was pretty tasty, too. It came over a corn pudding, which tasted verrrry corny, so buyer beware. We were also given complimentary cheddar scones before dinner, which tasted like the delicious Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuits, only in light scone form... mmmmm.  We each got a signature cocktail; there are 7, and they're named after the tallest summit on each continent. The Mount Vinson was very smooth - cinnamon, ginger beer, vanilla - and The Kilimanjaro was refreshing and sweet for summer - lemonade, cranberry, gin.  When we left, we noticed that the patio was packed! This is a great \"classy\" addition to a casual row of restaurants on East Blvd. Do yourself a favor, and check out The Summit Room."}
{"text":"Excellent food, unique cocktails & friendly attentive service!  Friends recommended this new restaurant since it was a pleasant evening for dinner on the patio!  We started with deviled eggs & hummus plate. All was unique and tasty! Pickled veggies on the hummus plate were delicious and crunchy! Oh the cheese scones were warm with crispy outside and tender center along with soft butter - they were melt in your mouth scrumptious!  Since I had read the mac & cheese was fabulous, I knew in the back of my mind I had to have it! So I opted for it and drunken mussels. Neither disappointed although I would have enjoyed more grilled bread with it. Delicious!!  My husband had the sliders which he said were pretty good. Friends got fries (which were wonderful, great seasoning) and another got brie stuffed hen.    Staff ensured we had full water glasses, wine was flowing, and all were friendly & attentive!  I can't wait to try it again and will probably get the farro risotto! I'm also anxious to try their sister lunch place, The Mayo Bird!"}
{"text":"Hostess at the front door was totally on her game  But the food really lacked in larger portions and no veggies, except 4 small blueberries on maybe 1 or 2 tablespoons of grits, how sad also I found that the cheese scones were very lacking. Portion control yet the Wait staff was very helpful.  Never again"}
{"text":"First time here and it was fantastic!  Sat on the patio and had great service.  Delicious food too - meatloaf sliders, mussels, deviled eggs, cheese plate with meats - all awesome.  Solid place - we'll be be back."}
{"text":"Started the evening with a Watermelon-jalapeno margarita. What a great choice. Our table shared one of every appetizer and no one talked while we ate.  The shrimp banh mi sliders have to be my favorite. So much flavor. The sweet potato gnocchi was just amazing. We sat and had wine for 2 hours and never felt pressured to leave. The owner came by several times as well as other staff. We had such a wonderful time. I suggest with cooler weather, grabbing a glass of wine and enjoying one of the porch rocking chairs!"}
{"text":"I found the food to be excellent at the Summit Room, but the prices to be a little out of whack for the area it is located in. My husband and I had the small plates and a few drinks. The sliders are great. They are super tasty. We had the Meatloaf and Pork Belly sliders. The Pork Belly slider is a must try. We also tried the scallops they had. This was where it got pricey. 3 scallops for $17!!!! That was a bit crazy. Although I really like the food here I don't think I will go back just because it is pricey."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Summit around 5:30 and chose to sit in the shaded patio. The bar and interior is retro-modern and beautiful but there's nothing quite like summer evenings on a shaded patio. From the creative drinks (try the cucumber or island) to the fantastic small plates of new southern food (crawdad pimento cakes and collards + cornbread) we were blown away. The food and drink is matched with attentive, smart service.  Thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, however, they changed their drink and dinner menu and it is nowhere near what it used to be. They kept the names of the cocktails but got rid of the staples i.e. the drink with the red wine floater. The chicken sliders were 3 chicken nuggets at best on biscuits for $16, not worth it at all. Very disappointed to visit one of our favorite spots again to find it empty and the menu changed.  Much better places to visit in Charlotte for the money"}
{"text":"Best patio in Myers Park/Dilworth area! Our server, Jennifer, was outstanding tonight. Presented the restaurants concept and menu well, was funny, friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The sweet potato empanadas are a great way to start your night and the duck is always good. Upscale menu in a casual neighborhood environment. Save room for the sweet treats after dinner."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. The bus boy, was seriously on point. Not a fan of the cucumber water, so they brought me regular water. We were a party of 5 and they were really accommodating. The summit burger was awesome, and the gnocchi were fantastic. We order four different summit drinks, which were $7.95 a piece and they were very good. Overall, no complaints, just a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I took my fiancé to The Summit Room for her birthday and I have mixed reviews. The drinks are great, definitely a strong point and can totally understand why people go to drink and eat appetizers. The apps and sides were great but I had a steak that I think they ran out to Applebee's and grabbed right after I ordered it because it was  absolutely terrible. I will definitely give this place another shot but for $100, I expect the entire meal to be amazing. Service was okay."}
{"text":"So this place is amazing. The drinks are so good, and have a interesting story. Just ask your waiter  or if they are good they will fill you in on everything anyways. The food was amazing too. I'll list below what we tried, all ballin' - only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's pricey. Not like you can go here on the reg unless money ain't a thing.  -blueberry smash (cocktail)  -mount Elbrus (cocktail) *my fav* [had 2!]  -pimento cheese corn fritters (app)  -Brussels sprouts (app) with bacon [amazing] -split entree - steak with i don't remember but I remember it being delicious.  --they also bring you scones & butter out which were very good! (While waiting for apps)   I don't remember the drinks my dude got but something with gin. Our waiter was a young guy who was legit! I forget his name tho. Go try this place out if you haven't! Even if it's just for drinks. Totally normal."}
{"text":"When I checked out their menu online, I was so excited to try one of the newest additions to Dilworth. I was definitely not disappointed by our first visit there tonight for dinner.  It was the first day of restaurant week, so I wasn't sure if we'd be able to sit down without a reservation. Luckily, there were still open spots at the bar and at the tables outside. We chose to sit outside on one of the few Charlotte summer days that wasn't overwhelmed with humidity. It was a lovely evening for a lovely meal.  We shared the kale salad, and he had the NC crusted trout, while I had the mussels. The kale salad was dressed with a light house-made vinaigrette, and had flavorful additions such as pickled thinly sliced radish, roasted peanuts, and grape tomatoes. Very fresh and light. It was a pretty large portion, so it was perfect to share as an appetizer.  The trout was lightly crusted and was pan fried perfectly to get crispy skin without being smothered in grease. The filets sat over a bed of creamed corn that tasted very farm to table fresh.  My mussels were delicious as well. Aside from the wonderful flavors, I appreciated the little bits of radish sprouts sprinkled throughout.   Overall, I loved my meal and look forward to trying the other items on their menu, such as chorizo collards, shrimp banh mi sliders, and their fresh juice cocktails."}
{"text":"The Summit Room! Wow! Great experience!  After a nice dinner nearby, we stopped in for dessert, coffee and drinks. What follows is a true story...  Mango Curd Tart: such a beautiful and playful presentation! Little bits of mango prepared in at least two ways, dried and candied/poached, with small peaks of meringue leading up to the tart. It was like a little trail of mango and meringue breadcrumbs leading up to the candy house. The tart itself is a sweet and sour mango curd nestled in phyllo dough and topped with a golden layer of white wine meringue. You must try this!  Cheesecake: two slices of cheesecake with Vanilla Wafer crust artfully placed with strawberry compote, rhubarb sauce and raspberry powder. It's cha cha time for your taste buds!  Chocolate Milk Dessert Cocktail: Godiva Chocolate Liquor, Kahlua, vodka and cream. Wonderful! You will not get a milk mustache from a martini glass, so don't be concerned. Way to tasty and smooth to be legal!!  Great décor, love all the antlers, especially the wall of ceramic ones; a very Georgia O'Keefe vibe. Lots of exposed wood embellishments and table tops, with a well-worn rustic feel but still with a modern undercurrent. The stainless steel water glasses are unique and classy! The wall of Mason Jars behind the bar is a nice surprise for the eye.   Our bartender and the other staff were welcoming and took great care of us. Other than a stunning menu and great staff, one of the best things here is the plating. It is done sooo artistically! Some of the dishes should be hanging up in a museum."}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in Charlotte! Cool vibe, friendly service, interesting drinks and fresh, tastefully done foods. 5 out of 5!"}
{"text":"We had such a great meal here! 6 adults and a little one. Their mojitos are sooo good. Great mussels, tomatoe stack, good fries, we had a grape salad that was really good too.  mashed potatoes, and scallops were my entree but we shared a lot! The plates aren't big so it's fun to pick! I'll be back soon, their outdoor patio is calling my name!"}
{"text":"Not only was the food OUTSTANDING but the service was just as great!! We received such great service at the bar while waiting for a table that we just sat at the bar. The bartender was so knowledgeable and informative (without asking) that it made our experience that much better.  Per the bartender, everything is locally sourced and made in house!  We were served cheddar scones to start, and let me just say.. they melted in our mouth! For dinner we had the Summit burger and Salmon. Both of which were amazing, we look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Great place but too expensive for a casual place.  Food is gourmet but still not worth it.  I Was there right after they opened and service was very slow.  Went back and sat at bar and service was great so the only real negative is price.  Love having this place in neighborhood but I can't really become a regular when hummus is $10 and majority of small plates are around $15.  Love to do small plates but at those prices the bill adds up too quickly.  Loved everything we had both times."}
{"text":"We were in town for a very short visit to the hospital and yelped a place to go to eat. We went to a later lunch with about 6 of us. The people at the door greeted us with a huge smile and opened the door for us. You walk in and the bar is to the right wall and tables all around.  They set up a table for us by the front window which brought in beautiful lighting. We each ordered a cocktail of the menu. They accidentally gave my sister the wrong cocktail so they comped it and bought us a glass of wine. The bus boy came around and constantly filled our water glasses which was awesome because boy were we thirsty. We ordered a pizza for the table and omg it was so delicious. We ordered the pimento cheese gnocchi, the lamb, the burger , and received bread for the table. I was not too hungry so the gnocchi was the perfect size for me. My sister had the burger and she said it was the best burger she has ever had. We are very pleased with the restaurant. we would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Our first experience at The Summit Room was a little hit or miss...   Highlights (food wise) included the burrata, BBQ shrimp and brûléed brussel sprouts. All of the drinks and desserts we tried were outstanding. I actually commented that I'd return JUST for the drinks and sweets. All the drinks are made 100% in house with no premade/store bought mixes and the desserts are so beautifully plated AND tasty! I loved the slow, leisurely service as I hate feeling rushed though a gourmet meal. We had about 20-30 minutes between each course. But, my boyfriend didn't like it and commented that service seemed sluggish. So, this could go either way, depending on your preference, I suppose. I also loved the laid back, \"top of a ski mountain,\" lodge-esque design and decoration. Oh! And the water!! I know it seems silly but I LOVED the cucumber water served in stainless steel cups. I drank at least a gallon's worth.   The lowest point was, without a doubt, the lobster nachos. They sound so decadent on the menu. The plate of store bought tostitos, embarrassingly skimpy amount of lobster and gross green stuff randomly globbed all over the plate was so disappointing. We had that first and I was worried the whole meal would follow suit. Luckily, we just happened to start with what I'd imagine is the worst dish on their menu. Trust me on this -- do NOT order this dish, no matter how great the description reads on the menu.   The burger, fries and sweet potato empanadas were just slightly above average. By the way -- I did NOT order all that food! ;) I went with friends and tried some of everyone else's dishes. Speaking of, the taste of gnocchi and shrimp bahn mi sliders I tried were great!   Topped it all off with pumpkin cheesecake. Perfect, seasonal dessert accompanied by these tasty gumdrop things and topped with smoked sea salt. It was the perfect mix of sweet and salty/savory. Two words... Yum. O.   Soooo, long story short, I think The Summit Room does have some room to grow and dishes to improve on, but overall, very solid addition to the Charlotte restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Really good small plates!  We got the Pimento Cheese Fritters (Maybe the best i've had! 1 a) and 1b) with Lettys! We also got the Meatloaf sliders which came on a sticky bun with delicious BBQ sauce.  Finally we got the deviled eggs which were layered with jalapeño ricotta!    The desert was fantastic!  Cookie pie in a skillet with chocolate ice cream and chocolate bark.   Very diverse menu.  I really want to try the Sweet Potato Gnocchi next time!"}
{"text":"THE SUMMIT ROOM: Go. Don't just sit there, GO. Go on! Get up! Go! You can read my review on the ride over.  This is probably the best new restaurant Charlotte's seen in a couple of years. Not only is the everything on the menu upscale, trendy, local, and fresh, but the prices are SUPER reasonable and the service is A+.  We went on an early summer evening, so we couldn't resist the urge to sit outside. The patio area is incredibly charming, with hanging lights and a view of a quiet part of East Blvd. The inside of the restaurant looked very pleasant as well: wooden furniture in warm colors with a lot of light coming in from the outside. Very welcoming.  Speaking of welcoming, our server knew the menu backwards and forwards and could describe each dish beautifully based on his honest opinion of the food. A server who tells you what's in each dish is good, but a server that is honest about what s/he likes is worth their weight in gold. It paid off.  We weren't chomping at the bit for food, so we went straight to the main event. I ordered the mussels and the BBQ shrimp, while my companion ordered the stuffed cod. Everything was fantastic, but it was the BBQ shrimp - which we split as an appetizer - that was by far the standout. The shrimp were extra fresh and quite large. They were slathered in a smokey BBQ sauce and served atop a sweet and luscious corn pudding. A touch of tasso cream on the side made for a great dipping sauce when desired.  The mussels were outstanding, with the innovative twist being that they were cooked in a broth made with Olde Mecklenburg Brewery Copper Ale. They were served with some stewed veggies and some grilled bread, which, let's face it, is the REAL reason why everyone gets mussels. The mussels themselves are always wonderful, but dipping the bread in the broth after you've polished off your mollusks is like touching the face of Poseidon.  The stuffed cod was quite good. The scallops stuffed inside were a wonderful touch and the fact that this glorious combination of seafood was only $24 made it impossible to turn down. The cod itself is presented beautifully in two pieces - you can see the pictures in this restaurant's Yelp profile - and comes with a candied lemon wheel and arugula butter. Both these accouterments can make this stellar dish even better if applied sparingly. The one thing I didn't like about this dish was the size of the sweet peas in the scallop stuffing. They were a bit too large and mild, so they ended up distracting from what might best be described as a sonata of flavors. In spite of that, the dish was still quite satisfying.  Okay, you've read my review and now (I hope!) you've pulled up to The Summit Room and are about to enjoy a fantastic meal. Bon appetit."}
{"text":"Innovative cocktails and cool small plates are served here. Tried a lot off the menu and it was all good. The three way cooked potatoes were lovely as well as the kale salad."}
{"text":"Only came here for drinks, but was very impressed.  Actually... now that I think about it... the last time I was in the building was when this side used to be a Bruegger's Bagels and the Caribou connected to it on the left side of the building.  My things have changed!  Their cocktail menu is super creative... each drink named after a real peak somewhere in this world we call Earth.  I like the idea of being able to conquer the summit... just like what I did with the two delicious drinks I had that evening.    Our party of 3 sat in the big communal high top, which was cool... I think it could seat 12?  My math/counting may have been on the brink that evening... but great to have the option of a large party table and the smaller tables spread out around the room.  Our server Nick made sure we were taken care of (even though we were there just for drinks).    Really cool, relaxed but upscale vibe to the dining space.  The food that was being delivered to the other tables looked pretty tasty.  I will have to come back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try The Summit Room for some time so when we finally got a chance we were NOT disappointed! The decor has a rustic shabby chic feel to it ,service was also  welcoming and on point. I didn't have any cocktails but the group I was with tried a few and everyone was loving them. We tried and really loved the lobster nachos, the burrata, bbq shrimp, the summit burger and finally duck and the pork tenderloin. Everything was really good. The portions are on the smaller size so if your sharing you will need to order a few more things. I would love to go back and try more bc the menu looks really interesting. All in all it did not disappoint. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and loved the  atmosphere. We sat outside and it was great!  I got the blueberry smash and it was fantastic! The staff and management are all very friendly and we had a great time."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Came in as a group of 4 on a busy Friday without reservations after calling in and being told there would be a 20 minute wait -- and they were confident about the time.   So we headed to the bar, where we were able to grab a couple of seats, some nice specialty drinks, and 20 minutes later - BAM - table was ready.  The menu has so many delicious choices, and we tried our best to eat as much as we could! We started with some shared apps:  Drunken Mussels $15 Steamed mussels, OMB Copper, roasted cherry tomatoes, jalapeño/sweet onion relish, grilled baguette. Mussels were fresh, small and sweet and dunking was must!  Fries and Gravy $12 Harissa lobster gravy, chive oil, cheese curd. This Southern version of poutine was good, although a heavier dish and the cheese could be improved.  Shrimp Banh Mi Sliders $14 Crispy pork belly, pickled carrot/jalapeño relish, cilantro aioli, on baguette. WOW! This was killer.  We moved on to main courses, but I was the only one to venture away from the duck:  Braised Short Rib $24 Fall off the bone short ribs, on the bone, roasted garlic potatoes   Duck $25 Confit duck leg and seared duck breast, blueberry grits, wilted spinach, pickled blueberries, pea shoots  We had lots of fun with the staff, both at the bar and the table.  This is the kind of place we would live at if it wasn't three states away.  Corkage $25"}
{"text":"Pros: A nice location--love that they have an outdoor space to eat. The service was great, and I appreciated that they had  fairly priced wine. The winner here is some of the best gnocchi I've ever had ! I would not hesitate to get the dish again, and it was clear the pasta here is homemade.   Cons: My friend and I had the Lobster Nachos and she said they changed from the first time she ordered them. This is definitely a problem, because you want to know if you like something it will be the same when you come back. Unfortunately for us, this time, they weren't very good. The lobster was scant, and the pimento aioli overwhelmed. My other issue with this place is that the portions are a bit small for the price. I would have loved to take my husband here since I  enjoyed  the pasta dish, but I know he would not be a fan of the portions so it likely won't become part of our rotation.   I will have to try again with friends someday, just to have that gnocchi one more time : )"}
{"text":"Surprisingly one of my favorite restaurants in the Dilworth area. Always a best bet. Great outdoor seating and ambiance. Both the food and staff are fabulous, especially Fidel, :)! Amazing cheese plate."}
{"text":"The two stars were for the ambience which was great!  With a table reserved we were seated quickly but that was the last quick thing in the evening at Summit!  It took us waving at every passing server for 40 mins before an order for drinks was taken, another 20 to get said drinks!  Once they arrived the craft beers and lemon grass refresher lived up to expectation!!  The food was mediocre at best! We had the trout and fries, potato gnocchi and summit burger!! Along with a kale salad which was pretty interesting ! The food however was okay, bland, another 15 mins to get ketchup for the fries..........and this was a Wednesday evening!!  We had heard great things! But IF WE return, a drink at the bar is all I am spending cash on!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food... 3 for the ambiance and service. This place is fairly new, and I hope the quality of the food keeps it in business - it was pretty quiet at dinner on a Monday night.  Upside - no wait for a table!  Very unique cocktail and food menu - made for a difficult choice. I started with the strawberry lemonade cocktail, and my husband had the Everest. Both were fantastic. For food we tried the street corn salad (with popcorn!!!), bbq pork belly with mac n' cheese, and the farro risotto. WOW!! We loved every bite.  Upscale comfort food at its best.  Overall, the ambiance seemed caught in an identity crisis - the decor has sort of a retro-modern farmhouse quirkiness, which doesn't seem to match the refined caliber (and price) of the food.  The restaurant is small, and has the potential for an intimate, cool vibe, but it didn't really deliver on this visit.  My biggest gripe would be the uncomfortable metal chairs - they were cold on my legs and looked like they belonged in a 50's diner.  I'd expect something a little more comfortable and high-end considering the overall quality of the cuisine. A few small cosmetic tweaks could help The Summit Room deliver the full dining experience you'd expect from this type of place."}
{"text":"After getting his haircut at Shear Excellence, the Goose likes going out in Dilworth for drinks/dinner. This past week, we found ourselves at the Summit Room by process of establishment elimination, and had a decent experience.  Honestly, this review might have 5 stars if it weren't for the Ojos del Salado cocktail. I love tequila, limoncello, jalapeno, and coffee, but this just didn't work out. I regretted it immediately.  BUT the other cocktails that I've tried at Summit Room have been delicious. I love the Kilimanjaro and Goose loves the Honey Crisp Old Fashion. They definitely add to the cocktail scene in Charlotte!  As far as food goes, the corn pudding on the BBQ Shrimp was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Goose really loved his Nashville hot sliders as well (the biscuits at Summit Room are on point!).  I'd definitely recommend checking this place out for cocktails and light bites!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!!  The flank steak served with bourbon brown gravy over house fries is outstanding! Their Cookie Pie will leave you smiling! Great cocktails and wine list. Service is always attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Dare I say that The Summit Room is the best new restaurant in Charlotte?! Yes, I do!  The concept is fantastic.  The owner had an epiphany moment after climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro which lead her to open The Summit Room!  The cuisine is southern inspired but is so much more than that. Dishes like shrimp Banh Mi sliders and hummus with harissa add a definite international touch.    I went with my family for Restaurant Week and was simply wowed.  I ordered the French Pear martini (Grey Goose La Poire, St. Germain and a Prosecco topper).  I hoped to try another craft cocktail, but this was so delicious, I ordered a second!   We shared the Banh Mi sliders which were incredible and flavorful! For my entrée, I ordered the stuffed cod (not on Queen's Feast menu) which was the perfect dish for a summer meal. I really loved the slight sweetness from the parsnip puree. I also highly recommend the pork belly if you're going for Restaurant Week.    For dessert, I sampled my mom's Krispy Kreme donut bread budding.  Holy crap, that is one delicious dessert. What is not to love about a hot and now in bread pudding form!? YUM.  Go to Summit Room...now!!"}
{"text":"For drinks that are this pricey, they should come with more liquor. I'd recommend drinking across the street at Kid Cashew, where the drinks are cheaper and stronger."}
{"text":"We loved everything about our dinner at the Summit Room.  We Ubered over so I can't comment on parking, but from the moment we walked in every person working there was friendly and gregarious. Our service was outstanding.  There were 4 of us seated at a round that probably was better suited for a larger party. After a while, we scooted closer together on one side and then it felt more intimate.  We ordered with wild abandon, so we ended up glad we had a big table. Mussels (great flavor, perhaps slightly overcooked), mac and cheese (wonderful, although we asked to hold the bacon), fries (super crisp -yum!), cous cous salad, cucumber salad (the \"everything\" seasoning is the shizzle), roasted potatoes (we fought over who would get the take home leftovers), pimento cheese corn fritters (no one should die without eating these), and 2 different flatbreads (mushroom variety was voted least favorite item on table though).  We had several people stop by and remark about all the food on the table (for 4 ladies, no less). Haha. It was EPIC.  We each had a craft cocktail and we ordered a bottle of wine for the table - yet.... only about $50 each (before tip). What a deal.  If you're going to go, just go for it! What you cannot eat, take home or just leave it. It's worth it just to try the multitude of amazing offerings.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails and tapas. Can get very busy during dinner time. Reservations are recommended.  Had some unique cocktails on classic that were very good. Had the lavender mule and their old fashioned while we waited for a table. Luckily, a table had canceles their reservation and we got seated. 6 of us ordered a bunch of plates to share. The barbeque shrimp over grits were good, but a little on the sweet side. The fried okra was delicious, especially the dipping sauce. The chicken sliders were almost as good as chick fil As fried chicken.  Corn fritters were solid as were the crab cake popsicles. Very good service, water was constantly being refilled. Waiter stopped by often to check on us  top notch establishment. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"A neighbor of mine told me to add a bookmark for The Summit Room some time ago, but we did not have a chance to try them until recently.  I'm so glad we did!  I really like restaurants that put a lot of effort into crafting their cocktail menus.  And Summit Room did a phenomenal job here.  My husband tried two of the seven summits, and I had their blueberry smash.  They were all good, but the blueberry smash was the clear winner.   My husband started with their soup of the day, with peas and fennel.  It didn't sound like one I would enjoy, but i had a few tastes, and it was delicious.  I had the pimento cheese corn fritters, and they were both crispy and spicy.  Yum!  For our entrees, I had the salmon, and my husband had the Cornish hen.  I believe their menu rotates frequently, but this salmon -- topped with a cucumber relish and served with puréed arugula and polenta fries -- was one from the best I've ever had.  The salmon was cooked medium (a little pink in the middle, just like I like it), and was so very juicy.  I never would have expected cucumbers to pair well with salmon, but I was mistaken!  They added awesome flavor to every bite.  The polenta fries were lightly fried and soft inside, and perfectly seasoned.    My husband's Cornish hen had a sweet glaze, and was served with peaches and johnny cakes.  It was a bit sweet for my taste (I prefer savory dishes all the way), but he loved it.    Service was very good.  This is a small place, and our server watched over us to ensure we didn't have want for anything.  Parking is great, especially in this part of town.  Summit is connected to Mayo Bird, and they share a very large parking lot on the side of the building.     We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"hmmmm.....for now I'm going to give 3 stars for The Summit Room.  I WILL go back with a smaller party and I'm almost positive it will be better.  Our waitress was extremly nice.  So nice in fact I wanted to be her BFF..haha! Our party was 11 girls.  That in itself is overwhelming.  11 loud crazy females.  Me included.  Anywho...so I'm trying to take that into consideration as well.  The first issue was that apparently they serve their wine with out the upcharge and sell them at grocery store prices.  YOU HAD ME AT \"NO UPCHARGE\".  All the girls arms went into the air and we said \"bring on the wine list!!\".  Until I saw the price on a bottle of wine that I normally get in another location that's not a grocery store however sells nothing but wine and beer.  (not sure if it's policically correct to name that said place so I'll keep it to myself).  It was list price for $35, but I normally get it for $18.  I was heartbroken.  Oh well...I still order it.  It's good and I split it with three other women so it made sense.    The second issue was that me and the girl next me ordered the same soup.  She also ordered a side of mash potatoes as our ENTREE.  We didn't order apps.  Some of the table did...but we didn't know this.  We specified that it was our main dish and we even handed back our menu.  Food starts coming out and the runners places our soups in front of us.  Cold soup that should have been warm.  :-(  Then....45 min later...we over heard the waitress telling the two girls across from us that \"those two over there got your soup that's why you don't have yours.  It's not our fault it's theres.....\" whaaaaa??  Come to find out they, too, ordered soup as an appetizer and it came out with the first round.  How were we supposed to know that a) they were bringing out apps and not main dishes b) they put the soup we ordered in front of us and c) how is this our fault again??  I didn't like the way she handled that but again...we were 11 girls deep and having a great time.  SO with that said, I'm willing to give this place another try but I def won't \"fall for the bannana in the tailpipe\" and order a bottle of wine that I could get for half in a \"grocery store\""}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant on East Blvd. Awesome patio, great food and the best service. We love Fidel the host!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  I came on a weeknight after going to another place, but not enjoying my food.  It wasn't crowded and we were seated right away.  The restaurant has a very cozy and intimate atmosphere.  The service was absolutely amazing.  Our server was the best I have had in a long time.  She was so friendly, talkative, and accommodating.    I had the meatloaf sliders, they were good!  Had a lot of flavor.  The wine list is decent and I had a lovely glass of wine with my food.  It was a really awesome experience and I'm glad I decided to walk down and give it a try!! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the brussel sprouts. Great service from David, who was very knowledgeable of each menu item. It does get a little noisy in here."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Came here as a large group and everyone was impressed by the food, drinks and service. We ordered several of the summit and seasonal cocktails; the standout was the jalapeño and ghost pepper summit cocktail.   Food: again several dishes ordered here but standouts were the fried green tomatoes, sriracha deviled eggs, and the scallops, although honestly everything was delicious.  Prices aren't cheap but the flavors, service and ambiance make this a spot worth revisiting. Reservations highly recommended - this is a small restaurant."}
{"text":"I hate I can't give these folks more stars because they were SO nice. Our waiter looked like a young Harrison Ford and was SO kind and funny. I had already eaten, but ordered creme brûlée and wine. The creme brûlée was great. The temperature was inconsistent, but the taste was grand. Tasted a friend's Brussels's sprouts and they were full of flavor. Had collard greens and they were okay. Flavorful, just not special. I'd come back here for drinks and appetizers. Certainly a place for a good time. Also, it started POURING down while we were there and one of the servers offered to escort us to the car because we had no umbrella. Just SO kind. As I type this, I decided I'm going back to try more food so I can hopefully up my rating."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out with a couple friends on a Friday night with no reservation (they were fully booked). The manager and wait staff went out of their way to make us feel welcomed. We ended up at a cozy LED fireplace settee in the corner, which was perfect. Don't miss the BBQ Shrimp, Mussels in IPA, Lemongrass Fresher, and Blueberry Smash. Amazing food and service. Can't wait to get back to Summit Room"}
{"text":"So, we're here in Charlotte to pick up our son and liked what we read on Yelp, so we stopped in. All of our expectations were exceeded. Bo, Andrew, John and Fidel were attentive, engaging and professional. The presentation and flavors in our dishes were amazing. We had the halibut special, the brussel sprouts (most incredible I've ever had) and the clams with chorizo and loved them all. The apple fritter dessert finished us off before we finished it! All in all, one of our favorite dining experiences in a long time!  Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Went here for late night drinks only, so I cannot comment on the food.   I like the atmosphere of this place. Chill, relaxing lighting and I love the mason jar background. The bartenders were very pleasant, and I could tell they put time into the cocktails they were making.   I enjoyed one of the \"summits\" - the Denali ($12). Very delicious drink. Right up my alley. My boyfriend tried the chocolate old fashioned ($11), and he wasn't as impressed with his drink as I was with mine.   We only got one drink each. I feel like the prices are standard for cocktails in Charlotte, but I feel like this is a one and done drink place or you will spend a million dollars. I really liked my drink, but didn't feel like this place was on par with say, The Cellar. I will come back for the occasional late night cocktail though.    I've heard good things about the food. A little of how wary dinner for two might cost though."}
{"text":"Perfection!  What a terrific new addition to the charlotte food scene! The very second that I tasted the buttered french baguette dipped in the beer based mussel gravy, was the moment I fell in love with the Summit room, and then...  with every bite of the other dishes we ordered, the love only grew stronger. With a unique cocktail menu, great wine & beer selection, and fancy new age southern food, SR and chef Brent Martin have a lot to offer. We started with a glass of red wine and an Aconcagua (a cachaca, based cocktail with fresh squeezed lime sour, muddled jalapeños, ghost pepper syrup and a salted rim) between the husband and I. On the table we also had the Drunken Mussels (gravy made with local beer from OMB - Awesome!), BBQ shrimp (my favorite!), the daily special fried green tomatoes topped with a poached egg, house fries (delicious!!), complimentary cheddar cheese scones (which were delightful), and we ended the meal with a pecan / pumpkin dessert with creme fraiche, caramel corn and sweet corn ice cream - unique and terrific!  I understand that in a few weeks there will be a different menu for the new season, but I hope and pray that the Chef will maintain his brilliant style, essence and absolute amazingness in all the dishes he creates!  Outside of the food now... The service was great; our server Scott was friendly and attentive and made great recommendations. With indoor and outdoor seating, the vibe and decor at SR is casual yet classy. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Only stopped in here for drinks - wanted to celebrate a new lease and a pay bump, and this was the end cap to our night.  Our bartender was extraordinarily helpful in telling us about drinks, letting us try different liquors to get our flavor profiles, and modifying our drink orders a little bit. Their specialty drinks are named after mountain summits, which is pretty cool (it made for a fun game of \"Google That Mountain!\"). I ordered the Aconcagua (a spicy drink named after a summit in Argentina) and The Lady ordered a Cucumber Collins based on our bartender's recommendation. Both were excellent. I didn't know they had a full menu prior to coming here, so I'm leaving this one on the bookmark list to come right back!"}
{"text":"The food here is good and the service is top notch! I really can't say enough about the service. In terms of the food, I always just get a bunch of small plates and have yet to be disappointed. The cocktails are great too. The patio is also a great place for a drink in the warmer months. It's on our rotation for sure."}
{"text":"One of Charlotte's newest and most welcomed places.  This dive bar offers unique alcoholic beverages along with food that is superb!  Only having been open a few weeks, they are still figuring out their service.  Food took a while to make and deliver for our party of 6."}
{"text":"Watch out for the food prices.  Probably the best new restaurant in Charlotte. Great space in Dilworth.   We sat at the bar. Super menu and the most friendly staff. We were made feel really welcome. The menu is fun, not the typical Charlotte fare. Or if it is; then it has flair.  They have a unique and cool way to pre-order or play-forward a drink for friend.  The only drawback are the food prices; they are too high, even for Dilworth."}
{"text":"One of Charlotte's great restaurants.  Great food, great service and great ambience.  There was 7 of of us and everyone raved.  We loved the watermelon soup, the trout and everything we ordered.  Elijah was our server and he was fun and made the evening special. Rachael sat us and also made sure that everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Hmmm... I really don't know how I feel about The Summit Room. I have had this spot bookmarked before and me and the boyfriend decided to venture out. FYI- seating is very limited so I would suggest coming for either an early dinner or a later dinner. Parking was easy with the connected parking lot.   I didn't care for the drinks at all. They were too strong for me, my younger self would've been more appreciative of the heavy hand but I had to force myself to finish the drink.   This spot is more tapas spot than entree based from what I saw so we ordered a cheese board with prosciutto which was good. We also split a shrimp dish, stuffed portobello mushroom (DELICIOUS!!!!!!), and macaroni and cheese. The food wasn't all that stellar except for the mushroom and I'm not even a vegetarian!  Price points were okay. Overall, I wasn't impressed but the vibe was really upscale casual- which I enjoyed. Service was also really good."}
{"text":"A group of seven of us out for our girlfriends going away dinner and our experience was unforgettable.  We had such an amazing experience. From the food to our wonderful server/bartender Jessica.  We did not leave disappointed.  Everything was delicious, Jessica was extremely knowledgable on the cocktail menu as well as the dinner menu.  Definitely a gem hidden on East Blvd."}
{"text":"This has now become one of my favorite new spots in Charlotte, I'll start first we the staff. Very welcoming, Frances the bartender just awesome! They make it a point to get to know you especially after you visit a few times. Now the food, love the Hummus, the pickled vegetables the come with it are amazing.  The Brussels sprouts are probably the best I've ever tasted, deviled eggs with pickled onions on top were a real surprise but very good.  The desserts are awesome and the drinks are great too.  I love the charm of the decor, a southern charm but yet you feel like you could be at a cute little spot in Colorado.  It is small so make reservations or arrive early before 7 on the weekdays. After 7 your going to have a tough time finding a table or bar seat.  Great location, great staff and great food!"}
{"text":"I can only write a short review since I stopped in for a drink, but bottom line, I can't wait to go back! I had a spicy watermelon margarita-like drink that the bartender recommended. It was a good, properly made drink. I loved the rustic, trendy vibe. I can't wait to go back to try more of the drink menu and some food."}
{"text":"Color me impressed!  This place was quaint, yet lively with charming character.  I met some industry peers for a dinner outing and I allowed the others to choose where we would go.  I had heard a few different things about The Summit Room, but had not personally tried it.  Walking in, you see a smaller restaurant with an open fireplace, a bar, and a narrow, but functional community table.  Other tables fill the space that they have utilized well.  There's also a patio area off the front and the building is shared with The Mayobird; another favorite breakfast/lunch spot.  The food was amazing and the service was excellent.  I had the salmon option that was perfectly prepared and portioned.  I also tried some of the family style mac and cheese that was spiced with a hint of jalapeño.  They offered a beer selection that included locals on tap.  The bread served was a light cheese bread, almost like a scone.  Water was served in nickel-like tumbler with crushed ice.  For dessert we shared a cookie skillet with coffee.  Two bites and I was satisfied.    I will definitely be back and would highly recommend this place.  My only complaint was that it was a bit loud, making dinner conversation a bit of a challenge."}
{"text":"The Summit Room is SOOOO GOOD.  Went for my birthday dinner with my husband last night. We shared as an appetizer the mussels.  They were amazing, and a great portion for the $.  I could have drank the juice they were in.  We got Brussel sprouts, and fingerling potatoes to share with our entrees.  I got the pork belly cornbread Mac and cheese (WOWWWW) and be got the duck (delicious) . the decor is really cool.  Reminds me of a cool place that would be in Charleston. . Finally a Charlotte restaurant I really can't wait to go back to."}
{"text":"My favorite go to spot for the eclectic menu, impeccable cocktails, and consistent and solid service. It can be hard to get a table, since they don't take reservations, but usually if you call in advance you can get an idea and time it right. We've tried the majority of the food, and everything is wonderful."}
{"text":"Good local beer selections and tasty food. They definitely put effort into their dishes and have creative offerings. Overall, I think this place is over priced and in a bit of a weird location. I would go back again for drinks but maybe not to spend a ton of money on food."}
{"text":"Went here tonight. The food was good the service was good/slow. There are better places in charlotte to eat at."}
{"text":"A fabulous restaurant in so many ways!  I started out with a craft cocktail, Honey Crisp Apple Old Fashion!  If you  like Makers Mark, this is your craft cocktail of choice!  House-made honey crisp apple syrup with a few other ingredients that made this is perfect sipping cocktail to start with on a cool, rainy night!  We enjoyed the pimento cheese and low country boil skewers as appetizers.  Both were off the charts delicious.  Paired with a pernicious beer from Wicked Weed made them even better!  The pimento cheese had a smoked flavor which made it very unique.  We also had the surf and turf flatbread -- shrimp and filet.  The atmosphere is small, casual with a classy farmhouse interior design.    I will go back on a nice evening and sit outside on the porch and rocking chairs to enjoy my starter craft cocktail!  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Interesting cocktails (my favorite was the Blueberry smash) and huge patio right on East Blvd. Didn't get to try the food but everything I saw on the menu looked amazing. Great date spot!"}
