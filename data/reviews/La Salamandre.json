{"text":"Delicious and worth it to take the Table Gourmande. Make sure you call to make a reservation, they're likely all booked on weekends. And Even better, it's BYOW!"}
{"text":"J'ai tellement adoré mon expérience lors d'un souper d'amis que j'y suis retournée, cette fois ci, pour un dîner du temps des fêtes avec mes collègues de bureau. C'était unanime, tout le monde a aimé la qualité de cette cuisine savoureuse."}
{"text":"Came here on a cold and windy night with a group of hungry folks. La Salamandre is a fish place and it's BYOW. The menu is written on a single classic black chalkboard and is a mix of updated classic French cuisine with a few game and other meat choices thrown in. The sauces are incredible and the portion sizes are European, so definitely go for the table d'hôte: I had the escargot (freaking amazing!), followed by the Arctic char which was done to perfection and dessert. Dinner came in at well under 50$ with a latte and everyone in our group raved about all of their dishes."}
