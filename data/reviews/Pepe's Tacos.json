{"text":"Food was very authentic and excellent! Best carne asada that I've ever had. If you live here or just visiting I highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"The carne asada burrito was delicious! I also had a taco al pastor which was very flavorful. The red & green salsa were terrific!

Highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"The food here is not good, and the service wasn't very good either. Sorry Pepe's Tacos, I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I really like their meat and the place is always clean. I don't know what these other reviews are talking about. Asada fries are to die for"}
{"text":"This is an awful place to eat.  I ordered a super burrito with carne asada.   My burrito arrived on the counter before I could finish paying.  When I opened it up I was appalled.  Every other piece of carne asada was fat.  I could not eat one bite.  Huge waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Las Vegas! Super authentic just like my grandmas and aunts cooking. Chile rellenos are amazing! I highly recommend their pineapple drink. Very tasty and my favorite drink We go almost every weekend. The kids love it too! Highly recommended! Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I have been to pepes tacos a couple of times. I like the food but the service is ridiculous. If you ever have Veronica as your cashier you can expect your order to be wrong . I have had to return my food more then twice because they don't bother to communicate with themselves and they have an attitude for asked to get what you orders in the first place. I often see people returning the good and being upset because they always get the orders wrong. 

The cashier Veronica has the worst attitude while working and you can expect her to role her eyes at you or even ignore the fact you are in front of her trying to order. She will take your order when she is finally ready. 
I can't believe she still works their"}
{"text":"My wife and i love this place. One of the best mexican restaurants around!its clean,the staff are friendly. When you order in english,they make a note of it and will call your order number in english so that you will understand. Prices are reasonable considering the quality is so good. Its always lots of people when i come but always get my order in a timely fashion. They are open 24 hours which is great for those party nights.. My favorite thing to order or the fish tacos and the menudo."}
{"text":"Fkuvking smells like a$$ inside this place... Food was alright but good lord did it smell.... Been there once and won't ever go back!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. So far everything I've tried has been good. Inside the restaurant could use some improvement. Whenever I eat from here I take it home because I don't like the inside but the food is great."}
{"text":"$10 whack ass burritos no thanks . They're meat is dry old refried beans I'll pass ."}
{"text":"Hispanic \"cholas\" looking girls and a plus attitude.... 
Tacos with no avocado? Not sure if they are Mexican tacos try taco taco Pecos and Tropicana those are real Mexican tacos :)"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!

Visiting NV for some Vegas thing and never discover this place even thou this was not our first time until we met up with some local NV residents.  Now I'm a fan and from now on this place will be the first place to pig out the minute we set foot in NV.  Their food are fresh and full of flavors with each bite.  We had carnitas, carne asada, lengua, cabeza taco and their deep fried tilapia.  Their portion size for taco are so much more compare to taco place in Dallas.  They were all delicious and now making my mouth water just thinking about it.  My only wish is for someone to open Pepe's Taco in Dallas."}
{"text":"Horrible. They raised there prices and the food and service are WORSE THEN EVER. I used to make it a point to take and friends or family to try this place because the food was so good. NASTY. Drive the extra couple miles and find a tacos el compita, there one 2 miles away on Westcliff. More affordable and much better food. PEPES HIGHER PRICES LOWER QUILITY"}
{"text":"The owner of this place  should  pay more attention  to  their customers. The bad customer service  his employees  are giving to his clients.  His staff  are  rude, specially  cashiers.   I don't  agree  the charge implemented for us customers  for paying with  ATM  or credit card, we get charged  a dolar!   The quality  of  their products  have been   deteriorating.  The food  doesn't  taste  the same.  The place  it's  durty, and the restroom  doesn't  even  work  some  times.  When  they serve  the wrong  order, instead  of fixing  the problem,  they make get the customer upset, and they argue with  them.  It's  very hard to park there.  Not enough  space  available."}
{"text":"Mexican food is one of my prime food groups, so I'm a tough nut to crack when it comes to it. Pepe's Tacos would be considered a mallet on my scale of mexican restaurants. 

I ordered a Super Burrito. The carne asada scent alone is mouth watering. Very interesting and vast menu options. You could order anything from menudo to a simple quite delicious cheese burger. Pepe's truly is an excellent choice to pick for a midnight snack"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Whoever owns the place better make changes before they're out of business. Ordered what I thought would be \"super nachos\" paid $7 for liquid cheese. If this place is authentic Mexican so is 7-11. Going back to Robertos where they have the decency to serve shredded cheese."}
{"text":"Went last night the tacos de lengua hit the spot.  The price is always good when I go there."}
{"text":"Wow amazing food, prices, sauce's, wow 
It's all good here. 
Soft tacos, Hard tacos, quesadilla, nachos. 

Loved it. Will always stop by. It's my king taco in Nevada!"}
{"text":"Well...once AGAIN they have raised their prices.  Asada fries almost $10....WOW! Hope you price yourself right out of business.......bye the way I really liked the garbage can on the salsa bar counter top....health district will love that!! Gotta nice picture"}
{"text":"Horrible disgusting old tasting food. My fiance and I are sick. Food was cold. Had to give it back twice. Best believe this is going to court, it made us that sick. We are both sick in bed instead of enjoying our Superbowl Sunday. Beware do not eat here!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, and Pepe's has some great AUTHENTIC Mexican.  It's not the best in terms of ambience or parking or location but I come here for the food.  I usually get the carne asada torta and it's usually enough to hold me over until the next meal.  I like to mix the Pina and Jaimaca for my own little concoction, which I would recommend.  And they have taco specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  So if you get the chance to try this place out, taste the food first and you'll probably be coming back."}
{"text":"One day the hubby and I were looking for a good mexican joint...we were tired of the food from the strip..so we were being brave and driving around a city we dont even know. This place caught our eye since its shaped differently and the color was oh so bright. 

We ordered tacos de cabeza....which are delicious...I really didnt care for the tacos de carne asada...ive had better...but the cabeza was finger licking good. the awesome part is that you get free refills on horchata which you dont find that here in our town....

This place has became a must everytime we are in vegas..."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with the family.  My girlfriend got two carne asada tacos and I got a carne asada torta.  The lady who took our order had the biggest scowl on her face when taking our order, which was a sign of things to come with our food.  The meat was flavorless and extra dry.  The bread of my torta was nowhere near authentic and it completely fell apart as I was trying to eat it.  The bathroom was unkempt with a strong smell.  The only good thing about this place were there natural fruit drinks specially their agua de pi√±a.  This was our first and last time we will come here.  We definitely were not curious about trying anything else.  Take your appetite somewhere else like tacos el Gordo or even Roberto's"}
{"text":"There's something about a 24-hour restaurant that creeps me out a bit... You can't really apply the normal dining barometers, and have to guess:  What time's the food freshly made?  When's the best cook's shift?  And when, pray tell, when do they clean the kitchen?  

Pondered that when, while driving on a road consisting mostly of derelict auto dealership lots and liquor stores (Vegas, baby!) spotted blazing yellow Pepe's.  Being from San Diego, thought I could sniff out a Mexican gem in the rough, and pulled in...  Or maybe I just like bright shiny things.

Apparently, 11:30am is not rush hour at Pepe's.  Parking lot had a few cars in it, but they must've been at the Pawn Shop next door, cause it was empty.  Looked at the menu, typical enough.  They were running a special 4 tacos (street-style, soft) rice and beans for 6 bucks and change.  Not bad.  But then saw the chile relleno burrito and had to order that.  Found the Holy Grail of Chile Relleno burritos at Tere's on Melrose ave in LA, been trying to find another one since.

This wasn't it.

Decent.  Good cheesy filling with a touch of the chile's smokiness, enhanced by some great salsa verde from the salsa bar (the red salsa tasted weirdly metallic) that I dollop-ed on each bite.  Chips were hard and cold (maybe why that other previous reviewer pooped out a periodical element.)  Beans were okay, a bit lardy but not in a great lard-olicious way... 

I'm giving it three stars on potential.  Maybe I ordered wrong.  Maybe there was something soul-enriching simmering in a dented, over-sized aluminum pot back in the kitchen.  I just know one menu item that wasn't."}
{"text":"Pretty much meh.  It wasn't terrible, but nothing worth making a special trip for.  I tried the al pastor and lengua tacos.  The pastor was a little dry and lacked the usual sweetness.  The lengua was tender, but didn't have enough seasoning or something... just kind of bland."}
{"text":"I dig this place.  Working folks and families.  Huge menu and the staff will work with you for the perfect item.  24/7 and safe.  I've been here maybe 50 times and have never been rude to, never received anything but great, real downhome mexican chow.  And did I mention the great mariachi jukebox?

spotless.

Most under $10, salsa that will change your life, man."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Friday, is was busy yet the food was served promptly.  Don't let the name fool you, this is a full menu Mexican restaurant with a varied menu including things I hadn't seen elsewhere.  We had the chicken quesadilla which was delicious.  As others have mentioned it is a little pricy but for us at least it is offset by the portion sizes.  We plan to come back for the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Worse service. I ordered first outta 5 others and was served last. And I had to remind them of my order. Will never return here. Pastor was burnt and food was cold. Las Vegas Voted them the best restaurant in 2015. 2 Years have past and they went down hill with their food and crappy service."}
{"text":"Hands down worst taco place ever ! Service was awful. They were extremely over priced and my burrito order was extremely wrong not to mention it was cold and my chips were stale and my guacamole was super watery and disgusting. Super sad about this because it's right by my apartment ."}
{"text":"My cousin and I ran and got tacos after work & missing the bus we figure we grab a couple tacos to kill time. We end up ordering 6 steak tacos. By far the best ever. The ladies here are very nice and plight."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito is out of this world good, I recommend pairing it with a grape soda."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, every time I eat there I poop gold and pee diamonds!"}
{"text":"Que bueno! Had a carne asada burrito and two tacos al pastor today....deliciouso! Def will pay another visit upon my next trans-barrio-adventure"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices. The horchata is a little watered down, but if you are looking for a good place to eat after-hours, check this place out."}
{"text":"Ate here on their grand opening.  I was very disappointed. Food is okay, but I've had much better."}
{"text":"The fact that this place is open 24/7 is great!!! It's better than Robertos too me. I tried the Chile Releno burrito last night which was good but I feel like the chimichanga is better. More buck for ur bang!! They are HUGGGGEEE!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Not the best carne asada fries, not even close! Nacho cheese on them instead of regular shredded cheese....doesn't make sense. We asked for no guacacmole and sour cream, still got it on our fries. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Went with friends and family. Had the super burrito with carne Asada.  Decent size burrito. The meat was cold inside the burrito,  Every one else that ordered tacos had the same issue.  Other than that food was ok. Food came out right away for a big order.  Salsa bar was fully stocked.  First time eating at this location."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to buy Mexican food, this is a good bet. The food and drinks are pretty good. The atmosphere is is decent, and the staff seem nice. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the last time I was there, they took forever to get my food ready. Besides that, It's pretty good. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Vegas local here, I've tried many places but Pepes has one the best carne asada fries, must try them."}
{"text":"Food is very greasy,last resort food for me.good for a late night meal or something like that"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the low ratings. I thought the beef tacos were almost as good as El Taurinos on Hoover in LA. Almost! Although on the pricier side. Plus I had to wait 10 minutes to get 6 tacos to go. But as long as food is good, I'm ok with it. My new favorite toco place in town. Another restaurant reminding me of LA."}
{"text":"I walk in, smile and say hi. Lady at the front ignores me and walks away. New lady takes my order but the chef decides he's gonna have a 5 min conversation with the first lady before he prepares my food. Too many better options out there."}
{"text":"FAVORITE MEXICAN RESTAURANT IN LAS VEGAS !! Seriously, no joke. To be quite honest we are always greeted by friendly staff (and we've been there more than 10 times since moving here 9 months ago). The establishment is always clean and the service is quick ! There are sometimes lines but we never have to wait, the employees are amazing. 

Weather it be 2 am or 10 am there is no difference in quality, it's always at its peak ! We have tasted everything on the menu, and belive me, it's delicious !! The portions are great, huge !!! You'll probably have left overs. The fresh squeezed orange juice is my go-to, the fruit is so ripe, amazing. Not to mention the Horchata, we highly recommend getting that. 

The Asada fries are to die for, always good. The carnita tacos are a personal faves, not to name names I've been to a place who charged 5x as much and their meat was dryer than sawdust. We highly recommend it here, our moto is always to \"taste it before you judge it\" and this place is definitely top 5 places to eat if you ever find yourself in Vegas ! Where did these bad reviews even come from???"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and avoid this place! Extremely disappointed with the food.  I'm mexican and a local here in Vegas so I know whats up, LOL!  

$15 for 5 tacos and a bottle of coke?!

First, the tacos are pricey for how tiny they are and with how little flavor.  Literally didn't taste like anything!  I honestly just felt like I was putting stuff in my mouth.

Second, they charge a 50 cent credit/debit card fee. Not sure why they need to do this as their entire menu is already over priced.

Third, there was literally a sign in every direction telling me how to live my life. There was a sign for the extra charge, a sign insisting on cash, a sign telling you to watch how much salsa you take, etc. literally a sign for a bunch of unnecessary stuff, I didn't feel welcome!

Most importantly the food was just bleh. You're better off going to another taco shop!"}
{"text":"AWESOME!  Quickly made.. 
Super burrito or tacos, is my menu choices."}
{"text":"This location has bad service.... less food than the north decatur location.  Must be ran by a half assed manager.  Called here to place an order and i was 15 mins away.  Was on hold until i got there.  The girl never even answered my call back and just hung up the phone."}
{"text":"Tried this place because La Bonita, in the same parking lot, didn't have carnitas ready yet.  Pepe's Carnitas burrito...  huge thumbs down!  This food is terrible.  Carnitas are very dry & bland.  I almost thought it was chicken at first.  Rice was dry and old.  Beans were pasty, almost couldn't even get it down.  More expensive than other places, not as good and not as much food.  Service was friendly & quick enough, regardless the food was so bad I will not be back and wouldn't recommend it.  Next time I'll wait for fresh carnitas at La Bonita, or even go to Roberto's (which is a bit overrated, still better than Pepe's)."}
{"text":"My sisters and I have been coming here constantly for the first week of my stay in Vegas. We were obsessed with the Mexican food for a while. I ended up actually liking tacos and the horchata and the burritos, but for some reason we just stopped going here. It was bomb af for a while, but then I guess I got more of this goodness in such little time.

There were flies everywhere that kept following my food, which made me sad..since I had to move around the whole restaurant to try to avoid them. Mostly in the afternoon lol.

I have a relatively high tolerance rate, but it pushed me to the edge when we visited the restaurant at 2 am in the morning.. the woman was a bitchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh tho! She lost her patience and put out her temper on me since I did not know how to pronounce half of the things I ordered -___- She even threw the plastic bag at my sister. Dirtyyyy!"}
{"text":"Although it is not the closest Pepe's to house and it's on an awkward, busy corner, this is my FAVORITE Pepe's in Las Vegas. It's my favorite place for Mexican food, period. 
If i'm with my husband, we order the Carne Asada fries. It's too much for one person! Be sure to do it my way and add onions/cilantro, red sauce, and green sauce from the condiment bar.  If I'm there at lunch, I order the taco special with cabeza. So tender! And then I treat myself to some cool, sweet horchata."}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but tonight is the last time I will go here. This place has gone down hill over the years. Had one wet burrito and 3 tacos and it was 18 dollars. What a rip off, each taco was 2.43 and the burrito regularly is 8 and change but to make it wet it is another 2 dollars. Are you f****** kidding me. Your carne asada is dry with no taste and you add way to much salt to make up for it. Save your money and go somewhere else. Less than two miles south next to the mall is a good place, or Tizon on the east side, or Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours , great food and friendly staff. If your looking for a Place to eat after midnight this is the spot highly recommend.*****"}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious but I have probably come here at least 7 times. 3 tacos = 30 minutes. For the love of God, learn to cook faster."}
{"text":"I went here with my family looking for a burger but instead we paid $6 for a plain meatpatty."}
{"text":"They are misleading.  They have a sign that says $2.69 breakfast burrito.  When I ordered they said it is only the breakfast burrito with eggs, cheese and beans.  What??? The regular breakfast burrito with egg, bacon, potatoes and cheese is $5.99.  That is more that a carne asada burrito at Roberto's.  The prices are higher than Roberto's and the food is worse."}
{"text":"I could say this is the best taco place in Las Vegas. It's also really clean every time I come there is someone always cleaning and mopping, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I make the trip from Henderson to the Decatur location as well. It's worth the drive if you want a good meal. I love the beef tortas. They come with sour cream, lettuce, tomato and I top it off with the salsa verde from the condiment bar. 
The Chili rellenos are yummy as well. The burritos are huge! 
The best part of this joint to me is that it does offer a selection that hasn't been adapted to the American view of how Mexican food should be. Also this is a far south flavor of Ecuador more than that of Mexico. 

The tables are picnic style and the benches wiggle around and most of the signs are in Spanish. So if like me you are limited to asking for a couple beers in Spanish be prepared to enjoy a meal of immersion.  The juke box pours out lively music, I love this place!

It's not uptown, but it's damn good!"}
{"text":"I went to Pepe's Taco last night.  I had an interesting experience.  I ordered the Asada Fries which was different from what I usually had in the past.  I typically get my fries from Robertos.  Pepe's Taco makes their fries fatter and thicker which were a nicer difference.  They also put nacho cheese over their fries, sour cream, guacamole, and of course the asada.  I think I like the ones from Robertos better because the meat is thicker and I like the salsa that they add on it.  I ordered my food to go and it did take a bit but I think it is because there were quite a few people before me.

They have a wide variety of meat options such as goat as well as the typical asada, chicken and ect.  They do have lunch specials but those are offered from Sun- Thur from 12-4. 

Inside they have a jukebox which is really cool because I have never seen one in real life.  They play Mexican music which is understandable because it is a Mexican Restaurant.   

I do like that I can see the workers cooking their food.  I was able to watch them prepare my food and watch them cooking limes.  I think they were a bit creeped out because I was just watching them.  Pepe's Taco does have a nice salsa bar which has green salsa, red salsa, some carrots and onions, and I think they were radishes.  I felt my Asada Fries were decent, but next time I will go to get some tacos.  They are called Pepe's Tacos afterall."}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place on my way to work for a little while now, and today I finally decided to try it out. I ordered the Super Nachos and was upset from the second I laid eyes on this travesty. It looks like they just dropped a small handful of chips into a pool of Velvetta that was probably warmed up at some point or another but was damn near frozen by the time it reached my plate. I've had better nachos at 7-11 for $6 less. I'll stick to the Roberto's across the street."}
{"text":"I would give none if possible. First and last time! Horrible, service and when you ask for manager,  they laugh at you like it's a joke."}
{"text":"So I called to place to place an order and she put me on hold. It was taking too long so I drove down there to just order it but stayed on the phone. I ordered there and waited and got my food there but they just kept the phone unhooked the whole time when I ordered in person. Then she took my friends order behind me and forgot to take his money. Then she picked up the phone and hung it up in front of my face. I got screen shots and pics just for fun lol. Thanks pepes."}
{"text":"The food was completely  cold!  Wtf. And it says world best tacos  haha please! I told lady to make me a new one she said no and put it in microwave really!@#  thw point is not to use microwaves. Really disappointed.  Smh."}
{"text":"Tacos riqu√≠simos. Muy aut√©nticos. Salsas muy mexicanas por lo tanto picantes... Excelente servicio. Todos muy amables.  Muy limpio el restaurante. Muy recomendable para los visitantes latinos de Las Vegas. Pasare la voz sin duda. Un lugar para repetir en cada visita a la familia ."}
{"text":"Is there a good reason that you put pounds of Salt on everything, it burns my insides and it is not chili, Way toooo much please consider it for future customers because you just lost one"}
{"text":"GREAT cheap eats here! They have a 3 Soft Tacos with a drink special that is not only cheap ($7.65 + tax), but absolutely delicious! For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would eat at a Taco Bell when they have Pepe's Tacos--for starters,  the ingredients are fresh here, and I KNOW that the meat I'm eating is REAL chicken. You can see the cooks preparing the food, and they not only offer the common fountain sodas, but the cool horchata, jamaica, and pina drinks.

They also have a jukebox loaded with cool tunes."}
{"text":"Good menu choices, friendly staff, clean restaurant, but the food is just okay at best."}
{"text":"Had the shredded beef tacos.  Very good for the price and portion. The beef was a bit tough but edible.  My friend had the carne asada plate.    Lots of pork.  That wad worth the price also."}
{"text":"Gosh as a aficionado of mexican food tried this location. People are nice but I did not have a fine gastric experience afterwards. Went with a pal who said this was a locals insider place for mexican food but just the opposite for me.

Oh well, maybe just a bad day on the grill.."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Fries? Epic fail! Maybe there other food is good?? I don't know! The world's best Carne Asada fries they have on the back of their building led me here and let me tell you that sign should be taken down! 

Likeeeeeeee Right now! Two stars for the onions and cilantro though!! That we added ourselves!"}
{"text":"Ive never felt so unwelcome & disrespected in my life. So my boyfriend & i get to pepes & we order 2 carne asada tacos, a side of sour cream, & a small water cup. The girl who took our order never gave me the side of sour cream nor the water cup ...i had to go back up there & get both. when our tacos came out they were a little cold but still really good. (thats for the 1 star). So when we were finished eating our tacos &  were about to leave i decided to use the restroom...when i walked over to the womens restroom door there was a women employee standing in the door looking around in the bathroom curiously ,So i said \"Hi, may i use the restroom?\" & she says back to me \"Are you smoking in this bathroom?\" i said to her \"What? No i havent even used the restroom yet im just Asking you if i can use it?\" So shes like \"ohhh.....umm....ok i guess\" and walks away. At this point im just thinking that maybe shes mistaking me for someone else? & the bathroom didnt smell like smoke or look like there was any smoke in there at all? it was just weird. So i used the restroom & when i came out, there were 3 employee girls standing around the door so i was like cornered...& the one fat girl with the braces says to me \"The bathroom is for customers only, you need to leave rightnow!\" i explained to her that I AM A CUSTOMER & that i was JUST EATING not even 2 minutes ago & that i didnt understand where all this weird judgement was coming from? She just kept on saying \"You need to leave rightnow!, you cannot smoke in the bathroom.\" So i began to leave because i was so embarrassed & confused & i hurd the girl say to the other girl in spanish \"Stupid druggies think we dont know whats going on. That bitch just lies\" & i turned around & said \"excuse me? Just because im white doesnt mean i cant understand/speak your spanish. Before you start accusing people make sure you know what your talking about !!! I will NEVER come to this place to eat again!!! how awkward & embarrasing!!!!"}
{"text":"My son and I were so excited when we saw the Pepe's was taking over the old Baja Fresh place. I was excited because I had heard from a coworker that they have an incredible carne asada burrito. My son was excited because he's a 16 y/o boy and two things excite him, food being one of them. Every time we came around the corner and saw the progress that was being made we giggled like school girls.

So it opened and we went and we were not all that impressed. I got the burrito and it was as good as advertised. My wife got the shredded beef tacos which honestly are the best we've had in Las Vegas. My son's food was only okay.

The place is just kinda dingy. And that was after being open for just one day. The people at the counter were not very friendly and never smiled. There wasn't a clean table to be found. And the unsmiling, unfriendly worker became more unsmiling and unfriendly when we asked if someone could wipe a table down for us.

I went a couple of days later to get a chorizo and eggs burrito...... I do love burritos! The girl tells me that will be $7. \"For a chorizo and egg burrito?\" I ask. She points to the menu and it's a full on meal with rice and beans. I ask what the price is without rice and beans and she tells me it's the same. Come on now!

The salsa cups are way too small and the red and the green sauce runs all over your fingers and drips back in to the vat. Now I keep my hands impeccably clean. Julia Childs would be so proud of me. But I don't know which person before me was picking their nose or had left the bathroom unwashed. I'm not really a germaphobe, but seriously!

I'll go back for the burrito or the shredded beef, but I'll use the red sauce I took from Fausto's

Last but not least........ what self-respecting taco stand has coke products? Really? Coke? You gotta have the Pepsi!"}
{"text":"Nasty! Nasty! Nasty! I hate giving bad reviews but this place had roaches! I wish I could give them a zero. I order a burger, my burger was burned, my chips were stale and roaches were running around the floor.  Made me sick to my stomach. The food was disgusting. I told the cashier named Esmeralda and she was extremely rude. I'm calling the health department on them. I asked for the manager and Esmeralda would not even give me my money back or his number."}
{"text":"Great Food Worse service ever! Its sad when u really just want the food so u deal with the service cause u know its good"}
{"text":"Best carne asada in Vegas.  The burritos are massive.  Nice variety in the menu.  Definitely light years ahead of Roberto's and other Mexican fast food places."}
{"text":"Don't go there .. Over priced 
And not good very small portions
Not worth it at all.    stay away. 
Plus they charge U 50 cents more for credit  cards.
A waste of money  $"}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting something fancy - it's cheap, a-ok tasty and big portioned Mexican food served in run-down but comfortable place by friendly people.  My husband and I only tried one menu item this time, sharing the super nachos with carne asada.  The meat had a good flavor and was plentiful, but I was bummed by the liquid nacho cheese topping.  That was the main thing I didn't like in our experience.

We were there around 8pm on a Sunday night and the place was busy with families and couples.  Everyone was just digging into their food - we liked the atmosphere a lot.  There was a jukebox playing upbeat Spanish music.  

Finally some maybe useful info:  they're open 24/7, they serve breakfast (going back to try that some day), you can pay with debit/credit, and in addition to the usual carne asada, carnitas and tongue they offer goat, chicharron, pig and beef stomach meat options if that's your thing.  Oh, and beware the red salsa - it's really hot!  My chilly lovin Indian husband even had a hard time with it!"}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks. A little lacking in personal service and that staff is a bit... blah but I love their horchata. Carne adovada is good."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Cali and verrrry picky about my Mexican food. So when I came to visit my sister she over 2 yrs ago we came to Pepes. And I was like YES!!! My asada burritos ALWAYS HAVE SOOOO MUCH MEAT IN THEM!!! The horchata is pretty good always. Last week my boyfriend order asada tacos and loved them."}
{"text":"We went today to Pepes Tacos to celebrate me n my girlfriend s anniversary of being together for 2 years and we went to cashier to order and the small Mexican girl with heavy makeup on her face say quieres tacos while filling her long painted nail and I said excuse me and She what I didn't stutter bitch are you gonna get tacos or what and I said wait a minute who do you think your talking to i'm with my girlfriend trying to eat here for anniversary and she said to my girl who of ain't this special u want beans with that hahaha.. I said what the Fuck is your problem you know what just give me a torta De asada and 4 tacos with 3 Chile toriados and 2 med drinks and she said yeah sure ok. I get my food when they called our order and they forgot the Chile toriados so I get up and told the girl with heavy make up (she wasn't wearing no name tag) I think her name might of been maria excuse me I asked for 3 Chile toriados and I didn't get them ovshe said wtf you think this is Mexico and yell out to the cook donde chingando esta Los Chile toriados que este pinch gringo sta llorando..

I hate and I mean I hate Robertos tacos but it might be something I might get use to. Why Pepes why u were my favorite"}
{"text":"The carne asada fries were much better at this location and the price is 8.99 but the one on boulder is the one that is ten bucks and less portion size so this one is the one I will go to even though its in a sketchy area and its always packed..my husband ordered lengua fries he loved them"}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed this time around.Paid $5.25 for guacamole and chips...thinking an authentic Mexican restaurant can succeed in this...nope...I rather go to Chipotle for chips and guac for $1.50 with better quality. 
To start the guacamole was watered down slush.
As I continued to eat it I found something in my guacamole and a burnt French fry in my chips...eww."}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible! 
I went in and placed an order to go. I ordered two Menudos (sin pata/no feet). Got home to find that both cups of \"menudo\" were filled with bones and PATA, and hardly any actual menudo in the soup. I called right away and told them that they got my order wrong, they told me to go back that same day and they would refund my cash. So I went back later in the evening only to be told that they will not refund me my money. I didn't even eat the Menudo because I had to save it all day to show them the \"proof\"."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been driving past Pepe's  Tacos for some time now and each time it was always \"We need to try that.\" Well we finally tried it today. Upon walking in we noticed how clean the place was. I'm a waitress and whenever I go into a restaurant I notice certain things that will determine if I eat there or not, and this place was impeccably clean. I was very impressed. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with a drink, and my husband ordered a bean and carne asada burrito. He asked for cheese and salsa but the woman taking the order must not have heard what he said because when he started muching on his burrito it DIDNT have cheese or salsa. We aren't the type to complain so he just went with it, he DID say it was still good though. My burrito was pretty damn delicious. It was hot, had good flavor, the cheese was melted and the tortilla was very good. 
My husband and I both tried the horchata and it was ssssooooooo good. Before leaving my husband went to use the restroom and said that it was extremely clean, and also, they have very reasonable prices.
Overall experience wasn't the best, but it wasn't bad either. Fairly decent food, okay customer service. We most likely WILL come back, but this isn't our new favorite place."}
{"text":"Went in on a Monday afternoon with family and we were helped promptly. We ordered the Carne Asada Nachos to share (there were 4 of us), and each ordered tacos of all meats, a Super Burrito special, and helped ourselves to the salsa bar. There was honestly nothing special about the food; the tortillas tough, the meat dry with no flavor, despite adding on some fixings, and it was a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Very good cabeza tacos and carne Asada fries. Definitely coming here again. Not that bad on price too."}
{"text":"I try not to complain but I don't live next door and I went late night and I didn't get my guacamole that I ordered and my burrito wasn't made right and when I got home it wasn't worth the drive back sl  Check your bag before you leave."}
{"text":"Over-priced, had flies, service sucked, smells funny, im surprised they didnt charge for napkins. Got a barley there bean and extra cheese greasy burrito with lots of extra grease. I couldn't get a refund tho. It should've been a red flag as soon as we walked in.  But I'll give the cleaning person props it was clean and they kept cleaning the whole time we were there.  My kid had to lift her legs a couple times for them....don't come here.  My first and last time...in fact i heard there was some in California also....i won't ever go there either."}
{"text":"The service is great but the food was very disappointing. If Roberto's is better than you're doing something wrong. We ordered 15 tacos and nobody wanted to even finish one. I really hope they start making their own tortillas and more fresh salsa."}
{"text":"The al pastor tacos here are very tasty! The place looks scary but what hole in the wall looks nice? This place use to be an IHOP back in the day. I gave it 4 stars just for the al pastor tacos. If you try anything else on the menu, you are on your own."}
{"text":"These aren't the best tacos around, but they are open 24 hours and I prefer them to Roberto's. The night we dined in the restaurant was packed. There was one cook, one cashier and one other lady attending to odds and ends. There must have been a dozen people waiting for their order before we received ours. We sampled a trio of carnitas, carne asada and al pastor. Each held up and no tough pieces were found. The dining area is awkward and it was pretty dirty on our visit. It's not a place to go out of your way for, but it is not a bad late night option."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! I especially loved the manager Monica! Super friendly attitude, great smile, and overall fantastic food! They spoke English fluently and got my order on 100% correct the first try!! I will definitely be coming back here! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Good tacos for late night munchies! Price was a little pricey for this neck of the wood. Too many damn signs everywhere in bright yellow and red text, and it looks really unwelcome for new customers. If you dine in, you get free chips & beans but not if you are taking out. 

The carnes asada and chickens tacos are good on some nights, but not on the other. They need to work on their consistency more in order to bring back their customers."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place because it's open 24/7, but it was very disappointing...

DRINK: They have a soda fountain, Mexican bottled sodas, fresh Jamaica and Horchata, and fresh squeeze orange juice. The orange juice is delicious. For the fountain drinks, they say that if you share your drink, they will charge extra.

FOOD: Ordered a bunch of tacos and the super nachos. The tacos were dry and bland. It tasted like it was just random stuff tossed onto tortillas. The nachos had a really big portion for the price. It didn't taste good though. I got my nachos with carne asada and it had to be the worst carne asada I have ever had. It is a staple hispanic meat and they messed it up. The chips were all soggy because they put waaaaay too much cheese on it. I love cheese, but this was unsettling.

ATMOSPHERE: The staff is always super irritated and makes their customers uncomfortable. The restaurant is really dirty with food stains and crumbs everywhere. I like that the restaurant is spacious and bright inside though.

*I rarely give such a negative review, but save your money and get real Mexican food somewhere that cares about authenticity.*"}
{"text":"Was not happy at all!  Rude employees,  manager yelling at the staff in front of customers,  overpriced,  small servings, condiment counter was dirty and gross, got my order wrong and treated me like it was my fault... Will never return to this particular store! With Roberto's Taco shop right across the street I don't see this store lasting very long with the bad experience they provide... Bring back Baja Fresh! Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"I love pepes tacos but this location was terrible first and last time coming here the cashier girls were rude and not patient at all and joking and laughing and looking at us made it obvious that they were talking about us and for no reason either. Bad service"}
{"text":"If I can give this place a zero I would. Worst Mexican food ever. Me and my husband went out to eat late night and everything else was closed so this place was our only option. The cashier was very rude. When we got our food, it was cold and disgusting. We were the only people there so the food should have been made fresh. We had to return to be reheated. The next day, we called because we were both having horrible stomach pains, and the manager was horrible. We called the owner and complained and he hung up on us. Never again. Think twice before eating here!!"}
{"text":"Great food but the cashier accidentally took my order wrong and even after I corrected her she still charge me wrong. They refused to refund y money they hadn't even made the food that I didn't order. Never been to a over priced Mexican food restaurant where the customer isn't allow to change order."}
{"text":"My stomach was growling for tacos when I saw the Pepe's on my left. A quick U-Turn on Rainbow, and I was there. My only regret was not being able to sample more of their meaty tacos. I tried the Al Pastor, Lengua, and Cabeza; all three were outstanding. The salsa rojo was spicy and flavorful, the place was very clean, and I will be back for more. And the best part is that I will soon be living very close to this location."}
{"text":"I feel ripped off. I blindly ordered a carne asada burrito and I paid close to $10 no drink. I sat down feeling like I over paid trying to figure out why it was so much for a regular taco joint burrito. Since this place is on Rainbow maybe it's unicorn meat I thought but nope. The burrito is good however not $10 good. I will never go to this place again just because it's over priced."}
{"text":"Good stuff! The steak quesadillas was delicious, Im not a big fan of Mexican food but this place was good."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go here again....clean place, everyone's working but the food isn't really good. I got chips and nacho cheese....they are plain without much flavor.
The 2 soft tacos I got where chix and Chicharron...they were both really small and soggy....I got them Togo so I reheated them in the toaster oven making them a little better....the salsa is quite spicy....honestly I'd rather eat Taco Bell. Sorry."}
{"text":"After an aborted early morning trip to another eatery, I decided to drive down Fremont to Pepe's.

OK.  East Fremont isn't the best neighborhood around.  But Pepe's was nice and clean.  I arrived at 7:30 or so on a Sunday morning.  I was the lone sober, non-Spanish speaking patron in the establishment, I think.

I stood in the short line and perused the menu on the wall.  The owners were helpful enough to place English words behind each item on the menu... i.e. lengua = tongue, cabeza = head.  The drunk, 5'8\" dude with the Elvis do directly in front of me went with tres tacos lengua.  Nice.  I think I'll pass on the lengua today.

I ordered a couple of tacos al pastor and a cabeza taco.  The lady behind the counter pretended she didn't speak English, which is fine.  I don't think she liked the cut of my jib.  I threw a couple bucks in the tip jar and headed to a corner table.

I heard the lady yell SETENTEQUATRO SETENTEQUATRO SETENTEQUATRO!  Hey, that's me!

I grabbed the tacos and proceeded to devour them.  Solid food...and only $1.49 a throw for the tacos.

Wish they had 24 hour taco joints in the crud where I currently reside.

Don't know if I'll make it back, not the best area and I'm the whitest guy ever and from Minnesota, so I didn't feel very comfortable.

But the tacos were very good and very cheap!"}
{"text":"These tacos are more satisfying than a stretch after a long car ride, or food after sex (really, its a good move).  

Pepe's is clean and the food comes fast.  I only order tacos here, mostly because I know they're consistently good.  Plan on ordering 2-4 tacos depending on your appetite.  

This visit I had a Carnitas (pork) and a Pollo taco.  They were both flavorful without being overly greasy.  I especially liked the crunch in the carnitas.  Hit up the condiment bar and add some pickled onions and salsa to give your tacos a lil' swagger.  

Get a few napkins and a beer, and enjoy the $#@$ out of these tasty tacos."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Mexican food, keep looking. This location is awesome. Unfortunately everything else about it, is not. I was really excited for this location to open up; it's right next to the theatre and sometimes all you need to fix a bad day is a movie and some tacos!! I mean really, who doesn't like tacos?

But I was so let down. 

The food portions are small, the prices are expensive ($10 for a burrito??) and they charge you $.50 to use a debit/credit card to pay for the over-priced food you just bought. Not awesome. Overall it's just a really poor choice. I would go on, but it really isn't worth it. 

Bottom line: If your looking to make poor choices, there are much better poor choices you can make in Vegas. Go ahead and skip this one."}
{"text":"Yummy asada fries. Customer service by Claudia is always the best.Asada fries were delicious. Claudia is the best cashier! The chiles toreados are by far the best in town. One of the best taco shops in Vegas."}
{"text":"I ate their chorizo breakfast burrito and had explosive diarrhea before I even finished it.

Their carne asada fries and nachos are ok.  Props to them for giving you a lot.

I've had average service, nothing over-friendly and no rude service.

Their 3 taco with a soda lunch special saved them from getting a 1-star review from me."}
{"text":"We waited 25 minutes to get two tacos, and one quesadilla.  It wasn't even busy.  We were there around 1am.  The problem was we were skipped over 3 times.  When we finally confronted them to ask about our order, some female employee by the name of \"Cruz\" was extremely rude to us!  I will never in my life go to this location again, and may never go to a Pepe's again.  

The food was bland, and boring.  You might as well go to a Roberto's.  It's the same flavor, and quality.  

We only went there, because our favorite taco truck, \"Felipe's\", was closed. 

Good luck if you go.....although I strongly recommend you dont!"}
{"text":"I can not BELIEVE this is the type of service you are choosing to provide your community with.
Yeah, I'm white woman angry as fuck cause why are there two slivers of chicken in my THREE chicken tacos.
Why is there more shell, lettuce, tomato and sour cream than there is chicken?!
My chicken was burnt, over the phone I got a sorry \"they're pre made tacos\". You're joking right? 
I'm paying two thirty fuckin five for PRE MADE chicken tacos that have ZERO CHICKEN.
Basically paying 2.35 for a lettuce, tomato, and cheese taco.
I purchased in hopes that they just had a couple bad nights one time. It's 4:30am, how do you fuck up a chicken taco. 
I wanted to order Don Tortaco first but no drivers where near by for delivery :/ 
This is a warning, do NOT eat here period.
This establishment needs a new owner or to get its shit together period. Such a disappointment in the Hispanic community. In the community period."}
{"text":"Nearest location to me, am a fan of their food, specially burrito alpastor one of the best in the city!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful ! Do not come here the service is bad and the food is disgusting . I had to stop by because a friend of mine suggested this after a night of drinking . I am making the effort to write this review in hopes that this place shuts down ."}
{"text":"Food was great.
Menu one big board filled with all kinds of delights.
Great horchata.
Price was nice.
Atmosphere is like any Mexican joint that's actually Mexican.
Daily specials. Quick.
Kinda seedy location if you a wuss. 
Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Lovve carne asada fries!!!! They make the best fries the cheese the meat the yum!!!! I love coming here to eat they haven't let me down yet!"}
{"text":"The service was absolute garbage. This middle-aged lady with the loudest, most rough sounding voice I've ever heard was a total nightmare. She snapped her fingers at me and was just a deplorable human being. The wait was over 40 minutes for a CARNE ASADA PLATE. Oh, and the actual food was average at best. There was one nicer lady who was super sweet. She was light skinned with big eyes and actually smiled. But I won't be back, like, ever."}
{"text":"Pepe's has great Mexican food and a pretty extensive menu, but I always seem to order the same items: a chile relleno burrito, a chorizo and egg burrito, or birria (goat) or carne asda tacos. Today I came for breakfast, so it was one chorizo and egg burrito and two carne asda tacos, which I took home to split with my husband.

As usual, the food was delish, but the only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the burrito was so dang greasy. Yeah, I know chorizo is greasy, but this was WAY too greasy ... like the tortilla was completely soaked through.

I do love their chile relleno burrito, which is one of the best burritos I've ever had. And their goat tacos are fantastic. So maybe next time I'll skip the chorizo and stick with the chile relleno. You can't go wrong with any of their tacos, which are served street-style in small corn tortillas. And while I've never tried them, the carne asada fries seem to be popular. 

Just lighten up on the grease, please..."}
{"text":"Horrible tacos compared to everywhere else. I would even prefer Roberto's over this. Cabeza was decent but the tacos al pastor and carnitas were garbage."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot, this location is my favorite! Yes the parking lot/area is creepy but it's clean, staff is nice, and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I love my breakfast burrito at Pepe's.  The carne asada taco is so good.  They are very generous when stacking that burrito and taco.  I love the hot sauce, onions with carrots, which compliments the food.  I love the great service of the employees.  I come to eat this 2 times per week because it is that damn good.  There are three locations.  And I have to say, Fremont Pepe's is the best one only during the day and early afternoon.  Other than that, at night the food is lazy."}
{"text":"WOW What a fantastic Taco Shop. I visit Vegas all the time and have yet to find a place i can say i Love until now. Pepes tacos is my new spot. and they are open 24 hrs.
If there's one thing I know is Mexican food!!! This place is the real thing. The People are very friendly and made some very good suggestions.  Good authentic food at at fair price.very clean and nicely decorated. The Carne Asada, and Al pastor  Burritos are amazing i cant wait to go back! Again and again.  
If you are a lover of Mexican cuisine you need to try this place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Every single time I've been here, whoever is at the register seems to have a huge stick up their ass. Prices aren't too great for what you get. Actually, the food isn't even that good, period. Only time I ever think to come here is if I want asada fries. But then I remember how terrible the staff is, and my craving subsides."}
{"text":"We've gone to many Mexican restaurants in the past. Never have we been so dissatisfied.

We walked in everything was fine. Till we started ordering, the cashiers could have been more friendly, I mean it's a part of their job right. We sat down and waited for our food. While waiting we saw cockroaches crawling on the floor... The meat wasn't as cooked as we thought it would be. Very unpleasant visit."}
{"text":"Not a good experience.  Tacos were as tough as sandals.  Salsa, if you want to call it that, tasted like it was passed expiration date.  Beans were flavorless and place was pretty dirty inside....dont plan on coming back."}
{"text":"These are pretty average tacos really. I hate to say that it is like 'Paul's Tacos', instead of Pepe's Tacos. What I am trying to say is the tacos are quite bland with the exception of the Carne Asada Taco. That had a bit of flavor to the meat. The Carnitas was a bit gringo tasting. 

I really have to Three star it because they were just tacos. Just your average tacos. Plus they don't serve guacamole! I'm trying to figure that out.

I do have to say the counter service was great, very friendly. The place was clean and had a lot of seating. I can't say that I will be back, I do love tacos so that is hard for me to say that.  :'("}
{"text":"Honestly not impressed. Cheap feel. dirty restaurant. And food was pricey for fast food. Yep this is on par with taco Bell except Bell has corporate standards. The printer paper signs taped up everywhere were funny and cheap looking. Two stars because the waitresses or counter girls whatever they are called were nice. Food was alright. 
Won't be back. I could honestly make the exact same thing at home. 
Avoid!!"}
{"text":"this  is  a  expensive  tacos  shop  i  got  5  tacos   with a  small   drink     for  15.95     ,  2.50  each  taco    (  small  one  )  bad  quality  of   food    and  expensive   and      charge   .50    if  you  use  a  card    really ?"}
{"text":"They have the best pollo tacos I have had in 3 months. Great atmosphere inside the restaurant"}
{"text":"No bueno.. Sorry.  Customer service not friendly at all. We did get a welcome at least. Best asada fries my foot. I order asada(steak ) but  the asada felt like rubber bands. Pastor tacos so so, but tortillas hard. The only good thing was the salsas. I really don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"I love pepes for my random drunken nights. This location may be the scariest but its definitely the best one. The tacos are the only thing I order. My boyfriend has gotten the nachos before, they didnt look to good. Personally robertos has the beter looking nachos ( i cant really judge though because i dont even like nachos). but anyway the asada burrito is good too! Love that they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"They now will honor their coupons. Still have not ordered the fish taco again since last time. they make a good cheese enchilada."}
{"text":"First came here years ago with my mom and sister after leaving a club.  We were drunk but remember it being delicious.  Came back a week ago now that I moved back up to this side of town and it is still the same.  Great authentic food, a nice salsa bar in the middle, Coca-Cola products (THANK YOU!)...and decent sized dining room.  Great prices.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I went last night with my sister and was very satisfied. We had the carne asada plate and the carne asada super burrito. The meat had a lot of flavor and tender. It was delicious. Nice portion size, we both have left overs. 

The service was good. Good prices. We waited less than 10 minutes for our food.

FYI: you have to pay an extra $.50 to use a card
But it's worth it!

I will definitely recommend Pepe's everyone . I know I'll be back"}
{"text":"This place is the closes to my house so I do come here at least once a week or two weeks depends, well not anymore they keep screwing food and today service. Walk in today and the cashier that is supposed to take orders tells me somebody else is ordering I turn around like what the F it was just a bunch of people reading the menu and deciding I e waited 3 minutes she was actually expecting to take orders in order of who walks into door first, crazy I just left. And however just to let everyone know asada here is horrible is prob bad old meat because it tastes like shit."}
{"text":"Okay so you need a Mexican fix? In Vegas you can get anything at any time and if you crave good Mexican food, drive out to this location.

Now Mexican food is a challenge in Vegas. While you might assume it's a town loaded with good places, it took us a couple years to find this place. Being a Californian and growing up around authentic places in Santa Ana, CA, I know good carnitas when I taste it. If you're Californian you would understand this as CA is surrounded by the best Mexican food in the US. 

So if you're in Vegas, this is one of the most AUTHENTIC places for carnitas tacos. I mean mouth watering carnitas that make you dream about them in the middle of the night tacos. The meat is soft, tender and marinated perfectly and loaded with tasty lip smacking flavor enveloped in a warm tortilla. In addition, I love the delicious salsa bar and the Horchata drink section as you can drink as much as you want. Big plus.

Pepe's isn't fancy, spotless no matter what time of the day or night you go and it's legit so if you want the best Mexican in Vegas, this is it.

One more thing, if you're going late at night it could be considered a little sketchy area because of the dimly lit parking lot but we never found this to be an issue as everyone from staff to customers has always been incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"Everything you want in an authentic mexican food restaurant! If youre looking for some zagat yuppie mexican food youre in the wrong place this is the real deal. My favorite is the Carne asada tacos and their super burritos. If you want your taste buds to explode try the carne asada fries!"}
{"text":"Super burrito was bomb... and i was sober... after some chiefin or drinking I always go to pepes tacos, but this was the first time I went sober..it was still fire..highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great location, friendly services.great open 24/7
 I would recommend it. Also be careful with cups. They leak easily.. thanks. ."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly. Restaurant is clean. Food is always good. I can actually read and study while I'm here. That's why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"The lady's here are disrespectful and always have an attitude. We were given food with a hair in it and they came they didn't see anything. I asked for my money back. Never coming back to this location"}
{"text":"PROS:
+ Open 24 hours, great for their movie-theater-adjacent location.
+ Birria is available daily, instead of just on weekends as at other spots.
+ Large, well-stocked salsa bar has everything from salsa cups to sharing plates to plasticware, in addition to the obvious salsas and pickled veggies.
+ Lunch specials available til 4PM.

CONS:
-More expensive than similar spots. Expect $9 for your burrito, if you want anything other than onion and cilantro in it, and an extra $2.25 just to make it \"wet\" style. All items are a good buck or two more than they need to be, and the quality isn't any higher.
-The birria was super dry. 
-You have to ask the cashier for napkins?! None are given out with your order, you have to ask for them. Ridiculous and inconvenient."}
{"text":"Awesome carne asada tacos,burritos, carna asada fries and horchata! Even though its not the prettiest place or area of town its worth it! They make everything there and they have fresh toppings for your food."}
{"text":"I use to love coming to Pepes, but recently I've had not the greatest experiences eating here. I rather drive across the street to the Pollo Mobile, which BTW smells way better.  I had ordered a pick up and when i arrived the cashier had told me it wasn't ready yet. Still waited an extra 10 min. And when i got home the food was not warm and a bit stale like it was sitting out. Hoping it was just this time."}
{"text":"In a town full of mom and pop taco shops, this is one of them.  Not that it's bad, mind you; it's just not all that different.  The food is good and the prices are reasonable, but it's nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is literally just A-OK. It's a rather large taco spot compared to a Roberto's for example. I hated the tables - the seating was like an outdoor bench? Just odd. The tacos were good - they were stuffed to the max, not little skimpy tacos at all. I was not impressed with the salsa bar, the red salsa sucks but the green salsa was pretty good. The chips they served on the side were straight up stale :( I thought it was pricey for what I recieved... $10 for 3 tacos, a couple of stale chips and beans."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Vegas I searched high and low for the best taco in the valley. After many disappointing meals, I found  Pepe's Tacos. Its located in a shady strip mall with that just looks that way... you'll be fine.  its open 24/7 and perfect for late night munchies.  I always went with the carne asada tacos and el pastor tacos.  The  thing that set this place apart for me that the quality of the food is always consistent. The asada tasted awesome every time I've had it. Cant remember ever having any kind of negativity experience at Pepe's ."}
{"text":"Heads up that the asada fries here are like crack- horrible for you but oh so good in the moment. They use liquid nacho cheese sauce rather than shredded. Not everyone appreciates this, but I actually prefer it for this dish. The asada is flavorful and despite other reviews, it didn't seem any greasier than asada I've had elsewhere.

The tacos are fine: lengua, cabeza, and asada with cilantro and onions are all hot and fresh. Corn tortillas aren't too thick or too thin, didn't have much flavor either but didn't fall apart which is  most important.

Not sure why there are so many negative reviews- location is in the parking lot of a mexican market, maybe clientele are more discerning? Has been clean with friendly staff whenever I've gone."}
{"text":"4 tacos, and a drink for $7.15. I added two more for $1.59 each. Can't beat the price. They put a lot of meat in their tacos. I had two of each; carne asada, carnitas, al pastor. They were all made fresh. Not the greatest but id go back"}
{"text":"Ordered a combination burrito and steak fries.. There sign ain't lying! They are the best steak fries in town!! Burrito was great too!! Best thing?! 24/7!! Must suck for the late night employees, if they don't mind the hours... I may be craving this every night!!"}
{"text":"I will have to say Pepe tacos taste really good. The only thing I do not recommend is the tacos. I do recommend the Asada fries. It's a combination of french fries, cheese, carne asada, two tortilla chips on top, a scoop of sour cream and a scoop of guacamole. The workers are very friendly. I do notice that they try to keep each table clean. They have other things in the menu but I have not tried that yet. I have tried the bacon burger. I would have to say the bacon burger is pretty good it comes with fries and a drink. I didn't notice that the burger kind of taste frozen a little but if you're hungry you won't really notice it. They have three other locations that I have not visited. The place is open 24 hours which is good when you're hungry in the middle of the night and just want something light."}
{"text":"Fortunately this isn't your typical Las Vegas Mexican food restaurant. Despite what some people may think, this isn't no Taco bell! The food was tasty, and priced well. I special ordered a AL Pastor super burrito without beans and add rice, it was perfect. The menudo  (which they have every day) was excellent. For a place that just opened up I would say they did a great job. I only wish they were in my side of town so I could go more often."}
{"text":"This Pepe's was just okay. It is very clean and neat inside, and the staff was nice. The burrito was a little on the small side, and the carnitas plate I got was dry, but the portion was good. I would come again though, since its 24 hours and close by to where I am."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious!
Open 24/7.
Carne Asada Fries are so bomb! 
My boyfriend and I couldn't even finish it, we had to save it for later.
Horchata is on point."}
{"text":"Food was okay not the best I got the asada plate. I've had better food. My flour totrilla was hard and hard to pull apart. I definitely believe that ths place is great for tacos but not a fan of the other food."}
{"text":"We thought this was a great taco shop. Very authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. Clean, service excellent. Can't wait to go back for another meal!"}
{"text":"Finally I found REAL tacos in Vegas. I moved from San Francisco and was spoiled with having real authentic Mexican food and couldnt find anything in Vegas but Robertos...
But not anymore! I always get three carne asada tacos, a pineapple drink and a scoop of their carrots and onions on the side to nibble on."}
{"text":"Delicious menudo and they for sure have the beat pasada fries!!! Delicious salsas and aguas frescas too!!!"}
{"text":"This place is run down, their cashiers are VERY rude, and their food is starting to get a little pricy BUT it's soooo good! That's the only reason I come back."}
{"text":"One star, yes 1 star. Been coming here for years. Tonight is the last time I step a foot in this location.  Me and my family decided to dine in. I order a carne asada burrito and ended up with a bean burrito with a table spoon of rice and steak. My son order carne asada fries and they gave him no cheese. My mother went to the cashier and explained to her the fries had no cheese. They literally tossed cold shredded cheese on top. She spoke up and told her \"really cold cheese\" they microwaved it. Never once did they apologize for the inconvenience. This place is going downhill."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and this location in particular. The food, the friendly bilingual staff and the speedy service make it a great place to eat. A relaxed atmosphere for enjoying a delicious, filling meal"}
{"text":"Meat was really dried , over priced and Mexican food doesn't even taste like Mexican food , don't waste your money here"}
{"text":"Sorry but will not go back because of the 50 cent charge on you card just another way to make more money"}
{"text":"Ah this place sucks I used to love going to Pepe's but the other ones like on Decatur and Washington. Ever since they opened this one I was super wxcuted but it's crazy it never did taste the same and the ladies that are there really are kinda off stand off ish. They also have the stupidest policies like if you take your food to go you don't get the chips and beans but still pay the same price, What?! Why?! Anyways they screwed up my order last night and made me go back no type of apology maybe some kind of free side offer nothing. Idk I give this place chance after chance and there's always something. That's why I'm writing this review. Pretty annoyed"}
{"text":"1st time tried this place and we are now fans! Great service, pricing and taste!"}
{"text":"It seems that they dont care to make you feel welcomed its so hot in there!!! Have you guys heard of an AC???"}
{"text":"Oh Pepe...what the hell?  
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I went here based on fairly good yelp reviews.  
Maybe they had a really off day today?

It was not good and made me very sad. :(
I'm talking worse than Taco Bell not good.
I love Mexican food, I love Americanized Mexican food and authentic stuff.  
I'm from SoCal I can appreciate del taco any day but this was embarrassing.

I was excited walking in because it had the feel of an authentic Mexican walk up.  
I saw some food coming out and I got a bit nervous so we ordered cautiously.  We figured nachos are hard to screw up and the special was soft tacos so we got those too. 
It was not busy but the food took forever!  We finally got our super nachos & tacos and everything was cold.  
They use canned nacho cheese sauce on their nachos.  No joke.  The super nachos had sour cream, bland guacamole, beans and cold meat.  That's it.  We tried steak, chicken & carnitas tacos they were all a bit dry and had no seasoning at all on the meat.  Did i mention all the meat was cold?  
Their salsa bar with a few selections, it was clean but their salsa was not tasty.
Service was average.
We threw out more than half our food.
Yuck what a waste of money."}
{"text":"I know there are a handful of these restaurants around Vegas, and I hope the others are better. We came here on a whim since it was right down the road from where we were staying and I figured that they would be about as good as all the other amazing taco places in town. I was wrong. The place is very dirty and while the staff was fairly friendly they didn't get in a hurry for anything. I hoped that the food would at least be good but I was wrong. I got two kinds of tacos and one was decent while the other was terrible. My friends got guacamole and chips with guac that was only partly made and a quesadilla that was like cardboard with beans that had no taste. This was eaten on a dirty table (the cleanest we could find but still dirty) and with trash on the ground next to us. We also found out that the bathrooms were locked and you had to get a key from the counter to use them, even though they were inside and just barely not visible from the counter. Even better, one of the bathrooms was out of order! The prices are average here but the quality of everything else is not. You can do a lot better for Mexican/WestMex food in Vegas, don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY !!!!!
This place is the worst!  Waited 20 min to get my food, to find out the made me the wrong plate.  Then all the meat was so dry, I couldn't even eat it!  I told the manger and she just looked at me like it was my fault lol..
This place is the worst! Please stay away, save your money.  I got sick to my stomach 30 minutes later.   Nasty food, nasty place"}
{"text":"The set up here is all wrong. You place your order and pick up your food at the same counter which seems like a good idea in theory. But when it's crowded, it's completely difficult to get your food. It's a tight space to begin with, I must've bumped into 3 different ppl before I even ordered my food. They have two counters. Why not use them properly? Designate one ORDER HERE, the other PICK UP HERE. Other restaurants seem to grasp this concept I don't know why they do business this way. It's probably frustrating for everyone including the employees who looked overwhelmed themselves. Okay, enough of that. 

The food was average at best. Good if you're really hungry. I'll be honest, I only came here because the line for Tacos El Gordo was insane and the yelp reviews were positive. I ordered a quesadilla for my kids, very greasy but they seemed to like it. The carne asada fries I ordered had nacho cheese on them, ugh! Nacho cheese? It's carne asada fries, not nachos. The tacos were lacking flavor even the salsa was bland which was kind of strange. After my very large horchata I needed to use the facilities. Have fun searching for the key first. Finally got the door open, wow it was disgusting in there. I don't get all the great reviews. As much as I try to avoid leaving a bad review I just have to be honest about this place so maybe I can save a fellow Yelper from disappointment. The 4/5 star reviews are very misleading."}
{"text":"Meh, was craving Mexican food after being out in Vegas for more than a month.  Growing up in Texas, and now living in California, I have pretty high standards when it comes to good Mexican food.

Menu items of note:

Machaca plate - the shredded beef was just OK, pretty plain tasting

Chips and Salsa - a rip-off, chips were a bit stale, and of course they don't mention that the 'salsa' that they give you is the same stuff that is free at the bar.  Didn't even have pico de gallo to give me instead.

Service:
Hard to gauge, cause I went there at 6:30 in the morning and was the only customer.

Reasons why I come here:
Needed a Mexican food fix, but instead left unsatisfied.  Found out a week later that Ricardo's was near me and is a much better option."}
{"text":"Since I am vegetarian I usually always order beans in replacement of meat at Mexican cuisines. That being said Pepes tacos has the most delicious beans which always enhances every dish I order. I am a big fan of the Mexican cuisines and this one of my favorite taquerias."}
{"text":"It's pretty mediocre sometimes better than others though. Definitely a go-to simply because of the convenience of it. Wish they would do something different with the chicken tacos though whatever they cook the meat in tastes off."}
{"text":"Tuesday 1:30 PM.  Though the tables weren't wiped down, and the 3 taco special was only for soft tacos, what the heck?, AND it is over-priced,  (By the way, their hard tacos are just that; HARD. Their shredded beef dry, with no seasoning or flavor, and the taco shells are saturated with oil, as in fried way too long and left in the oil thereafter). What made me overlook all of this was the EXCEPTIONAL customer service by the gentleman at the register.  We were immediately greeted when we walked in the door, he was polite about explaining the exception to the taco special, he brought our order to our table, (though the amount of napkins we were given were nowhere near enough), ... as we walked out, he thanked us and wished us a good day.  Nothing like stellar customer service to make up for the other areas they lacked in."}
{"text":"What Mexican restaurant doesn't serve tostadas, well this establishment doesn't-FYI... the tacos were just like any other Mexican restaurant. This was my BF pick. Should you ever visit San Diego go to el camals totally authentic Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for Mexican food ! Always clean and the food is always on point . My favorite is the Gorditas and the chicken tacos"}
{"text":"This place is ok for a quick taco or burrito fix 24 hours a day.  I must agree with other reviewers that some of their food can be a little on the greasy side, like their nachos.  What I really like about this place is the salsa bar, and the fact that you can ask for a \"toreado\" (fried jalape√±o pepper) at no charge.  What I dislike is the  fact that they will charge you extra if you want to use a credit card, in fact when I first went there and found out they charged for using a card.   I thanked the girl at the register turned around and went to jack in the box instead.  Like I said the food is not that bad, but I won't use a card."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices!  Never had anything bad here.  It's always crowded because the quantity is huge!!!  

I always have leftovers.  Check it out if you are around."}
{"text":"I like that this place is 24 hours but that is it! The people working just plain don't give a shit about the product they are serving. The food is not even warm! The carne asada has way too much gristle....And the bean and cheese burrito the cheese was still raw! They may have deals on food but steer clear of this place! I ordered more food after the carne asada was yucky and the woman who took my order didn't give a crap that I was not happy she was just like oh well that's nice... 
I met the owner and he said their food was really good! THEY WERE WRONG! The cheeseburger... Definitely needs some help! There was two things that my bff and I did like however... The fries... And the guacamole...we will not be returning.. that's sad!"}
{"text":"Love the carne asada tacos, chicken tacos have generally been bland in my experience, the al pastor tacos has been hit or miss for me. The super burrito and carne asada nachos have also been winners.  I prefer the carne asada fries from Roberto's more but that's more so to do with the fries used."}
{"text":"Came here late night, a local friend of mine suggested it. He's mexican, so he should know what's good! 

Carne Asada Burrito: Got it with the typical beans, rice, onions, cilantro.. However, the meat here was pretty darn good! Definitely better than half the places I've tried here in Vegas. They also got the lime, red, green hot sauces at the usual, salsa/condiment bar. A little squeeze of citrus and some heat always does a burrito good!

Carnitas Taco: Great flavor, not explosive but did the job.

Lemonade: They had this on tap/fountain drinks. So light and refreshing, haven't seen this drink option at any other mexican joints..

I'd come back, if I'm ever around the neighborhood"}
{"text":"We just ate at the pepe tacos on Randall. We all had the Carne asada soft taco. Everything was as fresh as can be. Loved it... the fresh horchata, Pina' and Jamaican juices are refreshing."}
{"text":"Urggghh....what a rip off $2.25 for a taco!? The breakfast burrito here sucks! Super nachos with grilled chicken is more like boiled tasteless dry chicken! NEVER ever AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Love the tacos here! Best Carne asada and salsas in Vegas yet.... well in my opinion this fat.  Haven't been to another restaurant that beats these tacos de asada. Now you can't count street tacos peeps.  But this place is great. Best asada fries too!"}
{"text":"Me my wife and my 15 month baby ate here Wednesday April 22 2015
We all got ecoli
17$ for carne asada fries 
A carne asada burrito
An a case of ecoli

Ill never eat Pepe's again 
Just a warning"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. We ordered before another people and they had food. I waited for 15 minutes for my order and I asked for a refund. The cashier said that it has no refund at all. If you don't want a food, it is not my problem according to what she said."}
{"text":"I always get the chicken tacos here, which are my favorite in town. My boyfriend opts for the breakfast burritos and he is hard to please when it comes to the perfect breakfast burrito and he really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean and the staff was nice. I had the burrito plate with pastor $10.99 + tax. The pastor was good, but not much in the burrito. The rice was bland, but the beans were very good.

The food is a better than average, but their pricing is higher and portions smaller than the competition."}
{"text":"Meh- That is the best word to describe Pepes. I've only been to this location and probably wont go back, there's better Mexican right down the street. The beans were terrible. Still on a quest for great mexican in Las Vegas and this place definitely isn't that."}
{"text":"Frequent this place a lot, well today there was paper in my taco and a bug in my red salsa. Went to the counter and addresses it with the cashier she said they could not give me a refund! The manager came over and tried to ask me if I wanted to order something else!!! I said absolutely not I asked for a credit and they said they couldn't do that either, he then tried to ask me how many tacos I had eaten and was going to credit me for what I didn't eat!!! After going back and forth they reluctantly gave me a refund as the place started to fill with other customers!!! Not to mention my girlfriend ordered a chicken burrito and they gave her a carne asada burrito!! I will now be going to tacos El Gordo their food is better anyway!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. I love their carnitas, simply delicious. Carnitas burrito, tortas, and super nachos are all very tasty and they give you a lot of meat on your entrees as well. Missing the fifth star because the restaurant is not always clean. But overall the food is great, service is friendly, and the prices are good. I will be returning on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I love this place.  They make great food here especially my favorite the Carne Asada Fries.  If you haven't had one what are you waiting for get your ass down here and enjoy some fine Mexican Food."}
{"text":"If I could give it 2 1/2 stars it would be preferable... But alas I'm not going to be that mean...I'll  give it an undeserved three stars... It's just not as good as the other Pepes.. I keep giving this place chances after chances.. It's way too convenient because it's directly across the street.. After months and months of trying it occasionally and being continuously letdown..I've given up altogether.. if you are in the mood for crappy fast Mexican food 
 I would try Fausto's or even the Roberto's across the street over this place."}
{"text":"I was in the area and hungry for lunch so I stopped here for tacos. The al pastor was absolutely flavorless and fatty.
The carnitas were gross. Left without even finishing my Tacos."}
{"text":"I am new to Vegas and was looking for some good, authentic Mexican food. Well I definitely found it at Pepe's. Happy I was referred here because I'm officially a customer as long as I live here. I got a burrito two days ago and now that I'm typing this I'm salivating. Go get one- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"One word Authentic! This is a very important Taco subject. Tacos are different in many areas of the world. In Southern California, where I fell in love with the Taco, they are on small handmade tortillas with minimal toppings. Pollo, Carnitas, Carne Asada, Al Pastor, marinated and grilled meat options that are simple but loaded with flavor. Maybe some cilantro and onion, a simple salsa, or a slice of avocado and lime. Nothing fancy but a nice three to four bite, well crafted, handful of perfection. So when I say Authentic, this is what I refer to. Pepe's is a good sized, strip mall, dive taco joint. You walk up and order. Wait for your number to be called and then get salsa from the salsa bar, some Horchata and sit down to enjoy. I must say also that the Lengua is the best I have EVER had EVER, even in TJ. I literally cryed tears of joy when I ate here. I thought I would never find a \"Taco Shop\" in Vegas after searching for Months."}
{"text":"Great service great tacos ...Monica the manager outstanding. ..We love her...she is a great element thank you very muchas Gracias! !!!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this taco joint since they opened, so finally today I got my chance. I was overwhelmed by all the choices they had. I stuck to the al pastor( marinated pork)mon-thurs they have a 3 soft shell tacos ur choice of meat, drink and refrained beans and chips for about $6.  Which I thought was a great deal. And I love the fact they are open 24 hours, and only a short distance from my house. I will be coming back... Maybe for dinner tonight, or breakfast tmw... Chorizo and huevos yummy..."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food at a good price. Nothing fancy just simple good food with good portions. Way better than Roberto's. Definately recomend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"I wish I would have used Yelp before we stopped here for tacos after Easter services. All 4 of us received inedible food. I took mine back to the counter and they just laughed. I didn't want to spoil my Easter mood so I took my food to the trash can and dumped it. We went to In and Out for lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious. Open 24 hours. Horchata on tap (most places make you pay for refills)."}
{"text":"Nope, not that great. Seriously.

For a $1.75 for a very small taco, not worth the price. Everything here is actually overpriced! People have told me to just eat the tacos not the plates, burritos, tostadas, etc. Cause you might get food poisoning.

Eh. I would ratehr go to another taco place down the street."}
{"text":"Can't say I am impressed with this place. While I know people who have enjoyed it, my experiences have been poor. My buritos have been nothing but beans and lettuce when I order beef.  Didn't taste great. Everyone else didn't seem too pleased with their food either. My dad ordered guacamole, and it came out high. He thought maybe it was a big thing of it. No. a little serving came out. It was ridiculous. 

I decided to try them again, cause people keep telling me they are good. I went in and tried to order. I was told they didn't know english ( \"No Ingl√©s\" ), and after struggling trying to make a order for some tacos and buritos, I raised the white flag, and went to leave. Some one past me as I went through the door, I hear in perfect english from the woman at the counter. \"Oh, hey! How are you!\"
I honestly don't understand why I have had such trouble eating there, but I have given up."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to Las Vegas from Southern California. We have been looking for some good Mexican food since we moved her. We have had a couple good places and noticed this one close to our home. We went in today and ordered a Taquito Plate and a Torta. I noticed when I picked up our food she only charged us for just the taquitos not the plate like I ordered. My food was crunchy but had absolutely no flavor. I'm glad I took it to go because I had to add lime and some salsa verde to get some flavor. My husbands torta was so soggy and flavorless he pulled out the meat and put it in a tortilla at home with other salsas and such to make it decent. We are extremely disappointed in this location and will never be back."}
{"text":"Always been Huge fan of Pepe Tacos ever since went too another location on North Decatur. From the day I saw Pepe Tacos sign were use too by Baja Fresh like HELL YAY! I was counting the days so once they would be open and it finally here! 

The hours are the same like the other locations open 24 hours. Now having it literally so close too my house like taco heaven on earth. LOL! The tacos authentic as can be nothing americanize about them. True taco no cheese in it or taco shell by the bunch. True taco is two tortilla heated up with protein choose with onions, and cilantro. The choices of protein choose from not just your basic usually get the lingua (tongue) but friend (god bless him for introducing me too Pepe) said next time try the buche (pig stomach). I tried the buche was really good. It different texture then lingua are carne asada. Like it. Never had it always like too try new foods in life. The salsa bar has all your normal fixing choose from diced white onions, pickled carrots and jalapeno, fresh cilantro, and both salsa red and green. I am HUGE fan of the red salsa prefect compliment with your tacos no matter what you order. It not hot hot but just right kick too it. Tacos they come with refried beans I love taste fresh made everyday and chips perfect way scoop up beans or leftovers from the tacos!

Since it brand new. It refreshing compare too the normal spot go too because its the complete opposite. New everything looks part, the signs, mexican artwork decorate some of the walls, neon signs, and it look great. It bigger then the other one been too. So not have too worried about finding spot too sit. Maybe cause it was new the place was packed. The only negative was they not serving there three or four tacos specials with drink. Is something they known for at all other locations and the three taco special use too getting. Still even regular its very reasonable priced for under ten dollars. Three or four awesome tacos, refried beans, chips, and drink. 

Without doubt love this place for sure be coming back lot more. I see duke in my future! -)))"}
{"text":"I know been while since reviewed this Pepe Tacos but it reminded me why same chain places one place can vary from another one. I gone too the newer location closer too the house on rainbow. I felt after going too my old stomping grounds so too speak the newest location some things not done as well. The refried beans much more depth flavor then other location. The refried beans cooked out more or sure not see as many whole beans random. Felt like the portion size is slightly larger then the newer location. The tacos always go with my favorite lengua felt like have better flavor at this location. Still newer one being closer too the house not stop me because fan of Pepe Tacos!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is getting all these bad reviews! I've been here multiple times and the food has been consistent and my orders have come out pretty quick. When I come here I typically just get tacos, and while they're not very big, they're packed full with meat. I eat a lot and I usually feel full after 2 or 3 tacos. I've been trying different meats each time I come so I can find the one I like best. So far my favorite is Al Pastor (marinated pork). They are open 24 hrs, but I have only come for lunch so I can't say how the crowds are late at night. During lunch, and especially on the weekends, I've seen nearly all the tables full here. So again, I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews of this place..."}
{"text":"I love getting the chicken nachos! The only thing is you got to eat them fast otherwise they're gonna get really soggy. If you're more of a fry person, I suggest the carne asada fries. Also, skip the sodas and opt for some of their fresh juices or horchata. My personal favorite is the pina!"}
{"text":"Holy greasy birria, burritoman! Another Pepe's! 

I mucho love cheap greasy Mexicanos food, so it's a given that I like Pepe's. I prefer the other location, further up Boulder Highway as I've always had consistently low-grade greasy food there. 

However, at THIS location, the food was SO greasy that it soaked through the paper AND the aluminum wrapped around the burrito. The tortilla barely held itself together and was practically translucent by the end of things. Delicious and totally satisfying? YES. Artery clogging and unfit for consumption in 'civilized' settings? YES.

This was the kind of burrito for when you are drunkski beyond all comprehension and need the perfect ratio of fat-protein-carbs to soak it all up & stagger through the night. 

Will I go again? If I'm in the neighborhood and need some cheap, filling, greasy grub. But chances are, I'll probably go to the one down the street instead since it's not only closer to home but has proven itself less lipid-drenched."}
{"text":"When I'm not feelin' having Roberto's, I usually end up here at Pepe's. This location is rarely crowded and there's plenty of parking spaces."}
{"text":"Pepe's Tacos is decent. I've had better, but this is close to where I live. Since it's open 24 hours, I can always pop in whenever I'm craving a Taco. As the reviews before me have said, this place is mediocre at best. I had 3 different tacos, the Carnitas, Al Pastor, and Buche. I did the 3 tacos combo with a drink for $6.50... Pretty decent deal. The cashier asked if i wanted 'everything' on it, and I replied with yes. I guess I'm used to Tacos el Gordo, because when they say 'everything' at that place, they give you toppings that compliment the taco. However, at Pepe's Tacos, all 3 of mine had the same. This made all 3 of my tacos taste exactly the same, with just the texture of the meat different. 

If I was in a rush or had a late night taco run, I'd probably drop by again. Otherwise, I'd probably go elsewhere. sorry!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for the longest time. Since i was in the area and it was bookmarked I figured hey why not.

Ordered a cheese quesadilla. Was way too much cheese. Don't get me wrong I love cheese but there was so much grease it was  gross. The flour tortilla was soaked and my toddler wouldn't even eat it because she didn't like how greasy her fingers were.

Next were the taquitos which were super crispy, which normally would be awesome but there was almost no meat inside. I couldn't taste it at all. Fried to nothing. 

It would be a one star if the red sauce wasn't so good."}
{"text":"Worst carne asada fries evvvvverrrrr.  If you like them you are 1.really wasted and anything taste good 2.never had real carne asada fries or 3. A huge fan of watery fake cheese sauce"}
{"text":"Been passing this place up for a very long time and finally we decided to give it a try. I'm from Los angles so I'm really big on Mexican food and things like asada fries. I ended up getting a regular chicken burrito
With no cilantro and no onions. It was pretty good.  Next time I want to see what their asada fries are looking like !"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Pepe's - not by choice, but because it's my hubby's taco stand of choice. Their asada is really good - but I'm a super nacho kind of gal, and they don't use shredded cheese which I prefer. Their prices have steadily gone up over the years too, unlike Molcasalsa and Robertos. 

My personal favorite is the carne asada torta - un-freaking-believably delicious!!! The Mexican coke with the pure sugar ain't bad either! MMMMmmmmmmmmm good!"}
{"text":"Errr...it's hit or miss here. Initial review was bad. Came back to give another try and I was pleased. Then came back again and it was bad again. I don't think I'll be back because I don't like taking below 50% chance on my meals. It shouldn't be a gamble on food. One bad time is usually enough for me to never return. For some reason, I've given this place more than enough chances. I don't know why but I just won't return. There are so many other places to eat in this city. 

I ordered the super quesadilla with al pastor. It was so sloppy, half filled with cheese, and the meat was like jerky. It was super chewy. Afterwards, my stomach was extremely bloated and made me sick. Like I said, I've been here many times recently and its hit or miss. No excuse. 

I have worked in restaurants for over a decade and I've worked in places just like this. I can almost guarantee that the prep cooks here over prep and so there's too much product. Instead of throwing away old things, they re-cook. This is how they think they are saving money but in reality, they are losing customers which they will end up losing more money. 

Although, most of the customers here look like they don't care anyways. 

I do though and so I won't be back..."}
{"text":"A GREAT PLACE TO GET FOOD POISONING!

The only thing I had to eat last Sunday was Pepe's Super Nachos with carne asada....It is Tuesday and I still am sick. I had to take off work for two days because of this place. I went to this place on a SOBER stomach and I have not eaten out in 4 days before this visit I might add. My food poisoning has been so debilitating that I am going out of my way to contact the Southern Nevada Health District as well as write this review on yelp in hopes that this doesn't happen to anyone else. 

If I were you I would take a good hard look at the bad reviews on here about this place. Everything they say I have experienced personally but lets break this down logically and not emotionally why you should not spend your money here.

Pros:
*Mildly mediocre food to fill you up when you are starving to death or have been drinking. 
*The carne asada usually tastes fine until you feel it a couple hours later lol.
*They have nice TV screens for the menu.
*The male employees are actually very helpful.
*Open 24/7 


Cons: 
*Racist female employees \"Adela\" and others behind the counter scowling at you before you even say hello. They will never say \"Hi\", \"Hello\", \"Welcome\", or anything to greet me personally when I order and will talk shit about me right in front of my face in Spanish as I am ordering as well. (They don't expect anyone who doesn't look Latino to understand Spanish). 
*Obnoxiously loud Latin Music blasting in your ears as you try to enjoy a meal
*Filthy Restrooms...it looks like a torture room from a SAW movie. 
*An almost impossible parking lot...SO TINY and a ridiculous location on cross streets with so many people trying to make u-turns from Fremont and others trying to enter and exit the diagonally awkward parking lot. This means someone is always honking at others to get out of their way and I've seen two verbal fights break out from just parking issues alone. 
*Homeless people inside and outside of the store ambushing you to ask for some of your food that you just bought or for money to buy their item (bicycle they stole or equipment they could not sell next door at the pawn shop). 
*The ordering and pick up system is never working the same, one day the pick up is the ordering side and the ordering side is the pick up side and some days they are both on the same side. It's not very organized and when it gets busy everyone is huddled around each other in uncomfortable awkward irritable silences. 
*No one watches their children in here and kids constantly put their filthy hands in the covered area with the limes, onions and cilantro grabbing limes and pieces of ice. 
*If you sit at the booth right under the air conditioning vent by the covered food area it will leak moisture on your food from the ceiling vent.
*They use nacho cheese instead of real queso, they should be ashamed of themselves for this lol really.
*The Chorizo they use is NOT Chorizo! Chorizo is not pink! Try a chorizo and egg breakfast burrito....you'll see.
*You can tell this place used to be an IHOP, who are they trying to fool? haha

Before anyone reads this and tells their friends reading this \"oh this is probably just one person who complains all the time\" actually I'm not, I eat here all the time but mostly when I am drunk and in a happy mood because its always open. I refuse to go anymore and would not want this case of food poisoning to be experienced by any of my worst enemies. 

For all you people giving them good reviews just go when you aren't drunk or stoned and you will start to see everything more clearly."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer here for the past couple of years, but let me tell you their service has gone down the past couple of years. Their food taste horrible, most of the carne asada has fat, and the cashiers are just plain rude. The quality that they are selling is totally overpriced. Why spend money on just fat and rude service? The music is also obnoxiously loud. The photo I've attached is how much oil was on my plate for my carne asada quesadilla. This is the last time I will ever be back here."}
{"text":"Beef on the taco tasted old! It was already overpriced! Also, who uses nacho cheese at a Mexican restaurant? Will not be back!"}
{"text":"The best carne asada fries in town!! Every time I come here, I always order it. Never get disappointed coming here. My wife will usually get the carne asada  super burrito that is also bomb!! The price is worth it big time. My only complaint is the fact that  every time we go we get bombarded with hobos asking for something or wanting to clean my windows. Maybe be in a bad part of town but I can't penalize them for that. 5 stars quality all around!"}
{"text":"Great food.. But a little pricey! Sometimes they can little mistakes like not getting your order right! But good overall.."}
{"text":"THE BEST!!!!! Moved here from Cali, and this is one of the first places my sweetie took me to. Great service, AMAZING food, (better then what Ventura has to offer) clean, and affordable.
Family is coming in next week and I can't wait to take them here, yet sweetie is afraid they will never leave after they taste the delisiousness of this place! 
GO! You won't be disapointed!"}
{"text":"Coming from the Midwest to Vegas with family that lives here so I have been to several places locally over the years. This place is good food crack. The most delicious food. Better than home cooked Mexican in southwest Detroit"}
{"text":"Service was wonderful, carne asada tacos were well seasoned, but the quesadilla was a grease ball swimming in oil. I'd come back for tacos but tacos el gordo is still my fave street tacos."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place but most authentic places usually are. The tacos were superb, not the Americanized type that Vegas is full of. Definitely looking forward to going back to try more stuff."}
{"text":"This place is progressively getting worse. I have noticed that they are expanding, which might be the reason why their quality in declining. 

My beloved burrito is no longer good. I've tried it a few times before deciding the lower the review. The steak is really tough. I have wondered whether or not the meat is actually beef. 

The cleanliness of this particular located has also declined. Roberto's is now by go-to Mexican spot."}
{"text":"Beat food HANDS DOWN ! Roberto's ain't got NOTHING on this place. Order late night though, they have the best customer service and food. Whoever the cooks are at that time, the food is DELICIOUS! We always oder the bean and cheese/rice burrito , carne asada fries"}
{"text":"I had a coupon to buy a burrito and get another for 1/2 off. i decided on chicken for the meat. I imagined shredded white meat chicken. I was going to use my debit card, but they were going to charge me extra to use that. I used cash instead. I got the burritos to go. At home, I cut into one and discovered that it was dark meat chicken, and not all lean meat. These burritos were unappetizing. I had to pick through the meat. $7.99 for one burrito. Not worth it, not even worth the half price I paid for the second one."}
{"text":"I have driven by this taco place for years and finally decided on Cinco de Mayo, to give it a shot. Ordered a carne asada burrito, two crunchy tacos and rice and beans. Nothing special. Salsa was just hot with no real flavor. Beans were soupy and it was 21 minutes from ordering to hand out. Customer service was however good."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Have given them a couple of try's. Shredded beef tacos are dry and expensive. Condiment bar is less than stellar. 
With Roberto's across the Street and a Mexican market steps away (who has some really good stuff at their food court)- I think they need to pick it up or they'll be packing."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy carne asada fries!!!! Tacos were okay I like the guacamole it was fresh and had a lot of flavor. Not the fanciest taco places but definitely good for your taste buds!!"}
{"text":"I came to this place early morning March 23rd just left the ATM for Bank of America on Eastern and Owens got $20 to go get something something to eat came to this place.. first thing I noticed I got no hello or welcome. Next thing I noticed the lady over examine my $20 bill.. I ordered my food with rude service I'm waiting on my food and the lady come to my table and asked me do I have another Bill said my bill is fake.. she was a racist looked at me funny as soon as I came through the door.. I've included a picture of my receipt from the ATM I just left.. I will never go to another Pepes tacos again. They hire racist illegal immigrants.  I ended up going to Del Taco which I hate but they gladly took my 20."}
{"text":"I have gone back to this place often to get carde asada tacos and carde asada fries. I wont try anything new but I love the regular stuff i get. 

There fries are really good and thick so they dont become mushy when they add the cheese and meat.

The tacos are hands down the best in Vegas."}
{"text":"Visiting a friend in Vegas and wanted a bit of breakfast... This placed looked fresh and clean inside and out... I ordered 3 things 2 tacos and a chicken enchilada... I must say they give you a lot of meat... Problem the flavor... There was none.... The meat inside the enchilada was extremely dry.... How does this place stay in business... I also don't get the loud music at 9 am... Come on it is the middle of the week... People take calls on their cell phones during the day... It was not background music, it was night club levels... Who manages this place... Won't give them another chance... The food was that bad... I am being kind with two stars... The place was clean...."}
{"text":"Pepe's is on a small list of taco chains in Vegas that I enjoy visiting.

Most of my encounters with Pepe's follow alcohol consumption (something beautiful about that sequence btw,) but I think I would  still enjoy Pepe's on its own.

I am a fan of the carnitas, lengua, and birria.

The food is good, but the value is great!"}
{"text":"drove by this place for almost a year and finally stopped to try it out. Very loud with the music they play inside. Ordered ranchos huevos. Watched them make my order and got it as soon as it was done. I took my first bite and thought that the it was pretty good. Second bite and thereafter not so good. The eggs had such a hard brown crust on the bottom that it ruined the rest of the meal. Not good and I cant see ever going back."}
{"text":"I love this place, the tacos and burritos are amazing. It's very convenient because they are close to my house and they are open 24/7 :)"}
{"text":"Just being honest, first time coming to Pepes . I got Machaca, shredded beef and eggs. I think owner needs to taste the food more often. Way salty, greasy, beef was chewy, and there was barely any beef. Thier competition, won't mention name has got Pepes beat by far, sad I go to AMC every other week and was hoping to be a regular."}
{"text":"Went for the Carne Asada Fries, will go back for the Fish Tacos!  Seriously, I just ate the best fish taco I have ever had and I've eaten them in 3 states and both sides of the border!  Freshly battered and fried fish, fresh cabbage, pico and three thick slices of avocado, drizzled with creamy and mildly spicy sauce all wrapped in two soft corn tortillas.  Yeah, it was that good.  We've had the Carne Asada Fries before and they are the best but the fish taco was the surprise."}
{"text":"The cashier just argued with me over the special they had posted on the screen. 
When I asked to speak to their manager, her and the cook both said he wasn't there. 
It is never okay to argue with a customer over a posted special."}
{"text":"How does this place have so little amount of stars? It's Pepe's Tacos, not some fancy Mexican cuisine restaurant. The staff has always been very friendly and the food is even more amazing. My girlfriend and I love to come here and get the menudo and a quesadilla with al pastor meat. This is definitely one of my favorite places to go to when I need great authentic Mexican food. The only place that I have to say is better is Felipito's."}
{"text":"Oh so good! And dirt cheap.  We couldve eaten 3 a piece, but a single taco each was a great little midafternoon snack to sustain us until our late dinner.  Delicious tortillas and meats,  a nice bar of toppings to add as you wish."}
{"text":"Love this place! My most recent favorite is the steak torta. It's dripping with grease but in a guilty pleasure-type way as opposed to being off putting. The service is fast and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"The pastor meat is garbage. Too much fat and the little meat that you do get, is charred. Carnitas and Asada is ok."}
{"text":"Great food. Carne Asada tacos are a little small, but made with lean meat.  Add a little lemon/salsa and you're set! The shredded beef hard shell taco aren't too bad either. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries!! That's it. Get those and you will love yourself. They are enough to share with someone.

The tacos are good too, but I'm just saying. I liked the tacos al pastor and the asada ones. The chicken tacos were my least favorites. But they were still good. 

I came here with a party of 8 HUNGRY people--and they did a great job getting our stuff together. There was a little confusion, as we were missing some tacos, but the employees there were really friendly and were helpful."}
{"text":"Taco craving = unsatisfied!

My boyfriend and I came here with a large appetites and low expectations, yet we still left utterly disappointed. I didn't come here expecting fine dining or amazing quality, but I did come here for no-frills-tasty-taco-satisfaction. Regrettably, I left taco-teased, jaw-overworked, and unsatisfied. Everything we tried was bland, stale, and super chewy. 

Their salsa bar was a nice touch with the grilled jalape√±os - they were spicy, sweet and the star of the entire meal. They also had a red and green salsa, but I only (slightly) enjoyed the green salsa - both salsas weren't anywhere near spicy or flavorful. 

Here's what we ordered:
- Carne Asada Taco - The carne asada tasted average, but I couldn't get past the mouth workout I did in order to chew it. It was way too dried out, burnt? and tough for me to remotely enjoy. 2/5

- Al Pastor Taco - I preferred the flavor of the al pastor the most out of all of the tacos we ordered, but alas the meat wasn't tender as I would prefer it to be. 3/5

- Lengua Taco - chewy with average flavor. 2/5

- Chicharrones Taco - I wasn't a fan. Slimy and texturally challenging. 1/5

- Carne Asada Sopes - is it supposed to be this dry with no toppings? dense and hard to swallow. Sits in your belly like a rock. 2/5

- Chips - stale and soggy. (??) They were disgustingly moist and flimsy. 0/5

- Guacamole - how do you screw this up? (Oh yeah, when you want to cut corners) Served in the tiniest cup and was watered down and soupy. 1/5

- Beans - good flavor. 3/5 

- Agua Frescas: Horchata, Agua de pi√±a, Tamarindo - I suppose they could be refreshing on a hot day, but they were also all exceptionally watered down. 2/5

A foodie friend suggested that we should order the \"famous\" carne asada fries, but we decided there were way too many upsetting fails to even consider returning. I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. No offense but I don't think Las Vegas knows the difference between what good tacos taste like even if it hit them in the face. Come to Los Angeles and go to King Taco. They'll show you how it's done and what a legit \"street taco\" should taste like.

I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and both of them had fat all over the meat. A proper carne asada taco should have nothing but tender juicy meat that is EDIBLE. I had to spit out half the meat that were in my tacos. Perhaps I caught them on a bad night but it is not likely I will be returning to this place. \"Best Tacos in Las Vegas 2010\" my a**. Whoever was a food critic for this place should be fired.

Honestly, Tacos Mexico (they have multiple locations in this city; ie. Tropicana or the street close by Stratosphere Hotel) is wayy better than this place. With Tacos Mexico, I've been here 10+ times and all 10+ times everything was satisfying.

The only reason why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 was because of the carne asada fries. They put nacho cheese all over the fries...a good addition in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town!

When I need my mexican food fix, this is the place to go. 

My husband always orders the Carne Asada Burrito, For me, soft tacos!
So good, at least one of each. This time it was Carnitas, Carne Asada & Grilled Pork. All the meats are tender and seasoned great! The toppings of cilantro and raw onions  are fresh & tasty, along with the red and green salsas.

The best and my favorite is the jalepeno pickled carrots and onions. Nothing out of a jar here, they make them fresh! Chopped carrots, sliced onion, jalepenos in a pickling sauce with cloves. Truly the best I have ever had! 

I come here often and am never disappointed. Clean and friendly service!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. I got carne fries with extra pico and extra sour cream. They didn't have pico. Okay? What Mexican place doesn't have pico!? Whatever they gave me something close to it. The cheese was really weird, the fries were soggy, it just wasn't something I liked."}
{"text":"Had to come one more time before I headed home. This was 2nd visit in a week to a Pepe's. So glad they have multiple locations and they are all good."}
{"text":"So I was surfing the set and saw a valid coupon for Pepe's Tacos at http://www.moneymailer.com/coupons/online/89183/dining/1994116?pageNum=2

I thought that sounds good so I printed it and headed in.  The coupon was for a free taco with purchase of 2 tacos.  

I presented the coupon and started to order.  The lady at the counter said she has to ask her manager.  I stood there and waited.  She came back and said she needs to see the whole coupon.  I went back to the car and got it.  She went back to her manager.  After a few minutes she came back and said she has to call somebody.  At this point there were about 5 people in line and she started taking there orders.

At this point I walked out and plan on never going back.  Amazing that they would lose a customer over a $2.25 taco when they spent money to send out coupons.  Very Stupid."}
{"text":"I was expecting more because their East location is incomparable to this location. I ordered nachos to go and the condiments were just squirted in top. Like they don't care about the quality nor presentation. The cheese was that cheese you get at baseball games. 
Cheap food, absolutely no quality!"}
{"text":"The super burrito was delicious! I was visiting from Florida and craved Mexican food . Great fast Mexican food. Fast service. Eat in or take out. Building is old but good food. Will be back."}
{"text":"This will be my last visit to an old favorite restaurant of mine. I loved this place. They had the best shredded beef tacos, lots of cheese sour cream on the side in the container plenty of meat, they were absolutely delicious. Last three times I've gone they have gone downhill. I stopped by after work at 1 a.m. Tonight, there was only a few people in there. The tacos that I got had minimal cheese, a tablespoon of sour cream, a thin pinky finger sized portion of shredded beef. They were tasteless. I am not even sure my order was correct, I asked for deep fried taco's, these were a crisp shell. It is a shame to see this place go down hill it really has been one of my favorite restaurants to go to and pick up some great Mexican food. Not any more"}
{"text":"If Yelp had an evil twin equivalent of the ROTD (Review Of The Day), this would win hands down. To the reader, I am not taking responsibility for your well being if you still choose to eat here especially after reading this review.

Let's start from the beginning. I bring my wife and two boys. I order 4 pastor tacos for me and my oldest. A cheese quesadilla for my youngest, and an order of asada fries for all of us to share.

So the food comes out. It all looks good. But looks can be deceiving. You know when people say don't judge a good book by its cover. Well this cover looks good but once you read the first page, it will make you want to rip it in half and burn it.

For starters, the pastor was dry like it has been on the spit for days. That's really funny because there was oil literally pouring out of the tortilla when I pick it up. My guess is that they dipped it in hot oil before throwing it in the tortilla. I should of took pictures of the plate it was on because it was literally transparent from all the grease.

The quesadilla should of been called a \"greasadilla\". My youngest only took a couple bites before he had to stop because of grease running down his chin and fore arms. The tortilla itself was already soggy. 

As for the asada fries I was hoping that would be the saving grace to this horrible experience so far. I was wrong. Boy was I wrong. I took a picture of it and posted it on here. It looks decent. But when we started eating it, we noticed they had used nacho cheese instead of shredded cheddar. For nachos that might be ok. But for fries that's a major no no. The meat was also greasy like they dipped it in oil to bring it to life. The only decent things about it was the sour cream and guacamole.

We ate or should I say tried to eat at least half of our food but it seemed like with every bite our stomachs were screaming bloody murder. But alas, we had to dump it in the trash. 

So in closing, memo to \"Pepe\", can you please cut down on the grease and at least make the tacos just a tad bit bigger? Once you do that, then maybe I will give you guys another try."}
{"text":"Stay away from that filthy place I was there and my iPhone 6 Plus was stolen I called the owner several times and they ignore my calls so I'm wondering if they're covering something or someone.!! Stay away from that disgusting place. Since there's no customer service or concern about the customers."}
{"text":"Best taqueria in las vegas, hands down. True to  Las Vegas, it's open 24 hours, bomb al pastor off the rotisserie right behind the counter.

If you are like some people on yelp, and you see a rotisserie of al pastor in front of you, but instead order carne asada french fries, enchiladas and nachos, you should probably be at roberto's with the rest of the people leaving the club at 3AM who aren't getting laid.

Their tortas, tacos, burritos are great. Meat-wise, the carne asada, pollo, carnitas, lengua are all average. The al pastor is the best outside of mexico.

Unlike california, where the health-code over-regulation makes it illegal to leave meat out unrefridgerated.........here in vegas they can do it just like the lebanese immigrants to mexico did when they invented al pastor. it's right in front of you on a spit with a pineapple on top dripping juices down marinating it while it cooks

so i dont want to hear any more how much better the taqueria's are in california.  i'm from there. only food trucks are open past 2:30AM

and one more thing, how can people complain about this place being dirty, and the next review complains because someone was cleaning the place......... retarded.

so..... five stars for having all of the above.
there are better tacos, but not open 24 hours, with friendly staff, real al- pastor, and the red sauce here is actually hot."}
{"text":"The best Mexican tacos in Vegas! Customer service is what matters!!     Avocados are fresh too ! ;)"}
{"text":"Pepe's is my place to go to! Love their tacos de chorizo and asada! I also love their burrito de chile relleno! Gotta' try it! Oh and their salsa is on point. Last night their customer service was slow BUT I understand that they were training a newbie at the register."}
{"text":"I went there today and I was disappointed with the tacos. I got the steak and pork.  the meat tasted old with no flavor the orchata that I got was good and the customer service was good  But I will not be returning and  I sat by were the have the soda fountain and there was a very bad smell like old  urine I guess the bathrooms are close by. Very nasty. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tacos were cold they messed up my girls order and gave us a poor excuse for their horrible food"}
{"text":"Seriously this is a fantastic Vegas secret! Totally delicious and authentic. I highly recommend you check this place out if you like tacos that are totally delicious!"}
{"text":"Below average tacos at best. Each one was about $1.79. You might think that's a good price until you try them. The carne asada was bland, dry and the quality of the meat was poor. The al pastor was better, but also dry. My expectations for the pork were high when I say the meat on a spit, but it doesn't come close to al pastor at other places around town."}
{"text":"Pepe tacos is my favorite place to eat soft tacos!
i am a Beef lover but their chicken soft taco is more tasty.
i like their green and red sauce.
their meat and product are fresh! 
they chopped the meat as you place the order 
usually i don't like corn tortilla but theirs doesn't have that strong taste :) i like their pineapple juice so refreshing! 
staff is very helpful specially when the whole menu appeals you 
if happens sometime that i just go their by myself 
it's open 24h/7h so if you like real good tacos, Pepe is the place 
price is very descent for the quality!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Burrito and menudo.  I used to have a place I enjoyed but they have destroyed their burrito so I needed a new place.  I LOVE the burritos here the meat is marinated perfectly they burritos are made to an authentic Mexican way.  

Of corse I need tons of the home made green sauce to drench the top. 

My Man loves the menudo here, it is one of the top 2 we have found for him in town.  You can ask for the Ham Hock or get it without, don't forget your onions and cilantro!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious!! The burrito has a lot of flavor and is juicy! The prices are fair authentic Mexican food! My family enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"First time at this Pepe's, but I've visited the Boulder Highway location before.

I stopped in for a carnitas taco ($2.25).  It wasn't the crispy type of carnitas I like, but it was still pretty dang tasty.  The little pieces of pork were soft and succulent.   The taco had two tortillas, a lot of meat and nothing else (I ordered it with no onions).  You can, of course, doctor it up with salsa and cilantro from the salsa bar if you wish.

Bathrooms are for customers only and they are kept locked.  If you need to use them, you are required to tag the bathroom with your gang sign.  They are serious about this policy.  They won't even give you the key unless you have a marker or paint pen.  If you don't have a gang, they have a sign up sheet.  Once you are all signed up and jumped in, you just show them your markers, and they'll give you the key to the bathroom.

You can, obviously, tag anywhere, but at Pepe's people mostly like to tag the back of the bathroom door or the toilet seat.  Any fool can tag the door, and they all do.  The real artists here are the guys that tag the toilet seats.  They don't even use markers.  They painstakingly carve their signs right into the plastic.  Can you imagine the dedication of these bright young artists?  Quite impressive!

Mikey C says: come to Pepe's, but please leave your sharpies at home."}
{"text":"The food here is good enough if you're very hungry, want something inexpensive, and want a large portion.  The condiment bar has some nice items (carrots, radish, lime wedges, various sauces, etc) but when you watch the way customers try and pour a sauce into a tiny container, you get a bit concerned.  Often, they end up spilling it right back into the bin, after it's touched their hands.  They may have to come up with a different system."}
{"text":"They're open 24/7 and they have hard shell tacos!! Most of the Taco places I found open at 3a did not have hard shell tacos which is exactly what I was looking for.

The restaurant is spacious with lots of seating but yes, a little run down and dingy. Everything was neat and clean though. 

We were the only ones in there when we walked in around 3a, but a few others came in after us.

They have a pretty big menu with lots of options. I ordered 3 beef hard shell tacos and my boyfriend ordered the regular tacos, 3 with beef and 2 with chicken. We also ordered chips and salsa to share.

It's an order at the counter and pick your food up at the counter when it's done place. Also, dump your own trays. 

The beef hard shell tacos were really good!! And they were huge! I ordered 3 but didn't even touch the 3rd one. They packed it with lots of well-seasoned and tender beef and topped it with a good amount of lettuce and tomatoes. They have the salsas and onions out for you to put on top of your tacos by yourself. I preferred the green salsa because the red one was extremely way too salty. The shells were good and crispy. 

I don't like soft shell tacos so I didn't try them but my boyfriend did like them!! They also give you a bean dip with chips if you dine in. I've never liked bean dip before but this stuff was actually sooo yummy!! 

For the chips and salsa, they just gave us a box of chips and a big cup to fill with which ever one of the salsas we wanted.... I was hoping for a chunkier, different salsa. Not the same salsa we topped our tacos with but oh well. 

The prices were very fair and the service/kitchen was fast! I don't think the lady at the cashier spoke much English though because I tried to ask her for a freshly squeezed orange juice but she didn't know what I was asking for even though there was a huge cardboard sign about them... I just gave up on asking for it and got a regular drink, which we tried the Mexican pineapple drink. It was good but a little too sweet. 

I'll definitely return for those delicious hard shell tacos!"}
{"text":"Great tacos in the service is super fast I like going here when I'm over at the Meineke up the street it's just a real good taco I like their taco shells and I always get lots of extra cheese on my tacos the lingua is the best I've been coming here since 2004 really enjoy their service"}
{"text":"First night in Las Vegas and picked this place randomly. Excellent tacos. Carne Asada is bombtastic on anything."}
{"text":"Worst tacos ever. Makes me sad. In LA. There are better places in skid row. People. Stop giving these people your money these are not good at all."}
{"text":"So I have to share with everyone about how much I love this place. For the area that it's located in, it is quite ghetto, I mean it is E. Fremont St. So you'll definitely have to get over that part of it. I am one of the pickiest people on the planet and you can see by all of my awful horrible ratings on yelp. I normally only leave good and bad comments with my experiences as there's rarely a grey area and everything is black and white. 

Their food is great!!!  Their enchiladas are my favorite. Wet burrito, asada fries, fish tacos, carnitas, nachos ... Are all really good. Substitutions are the only issue I have. I wish they would make more vegetarian items and substitutions. 

Definitely love this place!!!"}
{"text":"They're tacos are pretty expensive here, in my opinion a lot of the food is overpriced especially for the quality and portion size. Their asada lacks a bit of flavor, beans are pretty dry.. The chorizo is pretty good, service is good. Pricing and food taste is so so. I've had better. 

They are open 24 hours, so if nothing is open super late I might stop by here if I'm super hungry."}
{"text":"Loved Pepe's Tacos at this location.  Servings are generous and the food is great. Can't say enough about customer service. ....it was a delightful experience.  You gotta try the Carne asada Fries. They are great.  The tacos are excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome fast food - WAY better than Rigo's and esp Roberto's, which I hate by the way. Try my OWN SPECIAL concoction - Half JAMAICA drink with half PINEAPPLE agua (flavored drink, kinda like lemonade) and a squeeze of lime. its an authentic Mexican place so dont expect American customs here. Remember its fast food. Location is not  bad, just looks old. Its an old building and the people are cool, no one bothers you."}
{"text":"It's one of the closest place to get decent tacos near my new place. I've been to one of the other locations and they seem to be very similar. I haven't been to Pepe's in a while. I think their prices went up. Burritos seem expensive like $8-9 but tacos are still $2.25. I went ahead and grabbed two pastor tacos and even a churro sundae. I grabbed some green salsa and lime and waited for my order to be called. I was surprised how long it took because there were only a few of us in there and it was really late like after midnight. The lobby is pretty big. I bet it get busy on the weekends or at night after partying. My order was called and I grabbed my tacos and sundae to go, I took my food home and killed it. Tacos were great and the churro sundae was bomb! Such a good Idea. I thought of something I want to try. Maybe a horchata float type thing. Should I patent that? Idk. It sounds like it would be bomb af. Next time I'll try it. Over all Pepe's is much better than the crap taco bell and such around town and it's also open 24/7 and that's a huge plus with my schedule. Keep up the great tacos y'all."}
{"text":"So it usually bothers me when someone puts they have the best fill in the blank in town.. However, Pepe's Taco can do it. They have my seal of approval. In their establishment they have a sign that reads best carne asada nachos in town. They aren't wrong. They have great food for a great price. I came here for some late night ratchetness and brought along a friend to fatten him up. First thing I notice when I walk in is all the seating. Usually places only have a couple seat for you to wait or a couple tables on the side for people dining in. This location had seats on either side and some cool benches. On Yelp it says they close at 2, but they are actually open 24 hours which I was thankful for. Who knew you could sit and talk in a taco shop for almost 2 hours. I of course had to be fat and order the nachos. My friend ordered some pork tacos. We sat down and waited for our food. I see them all the time and it makes me laugh but they have the posted signs for no refills or there will be an additional charge. I think we refilled our drink like 5 times and nothing was said.. I know they are trying to watch their costs and whatnot but it's like cents per cup. They also have a jukebox that randomly plays music and stares the pee out of you. After getting my food I hit the salsa bar and grab green salsa, my favorite, and some limes. I know it was late but everything seemed kind of empty. I think grabbed the last limes.. oh well. They i opened my box and went in on my nachos. They had everything a little separated which I liked. All in all I had a fun time being ratchet at 1 in the morning."}
{"text":"The menu is extensive and the food is authentic. We were tourists looking for something that was inexpensive yet unique to Las Vegas. A local suggested this place and we were not disappointed. The tacos are amazing! The only reason why we didn't give it five stars is because it could probably be cleaner"}
{"text":"I usually don't eat Mex food, but i will eat here. only the tacos tho. sometimes they don't  chop up the carne asada enough and i'm chewing big hunks of meat. but overall they're good. the pork ones are also."}
{"text":"I went to Pepe's today and got the best service from Anahi,  she was awesome!  The food was great too.  My buddies and I had a few beers and a pound of carne asada, it was da bomb!"}
{"text":"I went o Pepe's and got awesome service from Anahi, she was awesome!  We bought a pound of Carne Asada, it was da bomb!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I hate their tacos. In comparison to other places, like Tacos el Gordo, it's just horrible."}
{"text":"It was late and we were looking for something that was open at 2am and we weren't familiar with the area and ended up on Fremont street. We got off of that and just cruised around for a bit and then spotted Pepe's.
 I am so glad we spotted it! Our food was delicious!!!  We got it to go. We got the super quesadilla, carne asada fries and two hard tacos and a large drink.  Their coke was so good! Usually I don't drink coke but theirs had flavor and wasn't flat and didn't lack proper syrup. 
 My husband munched on some food while I used their clean restroom. 
 We ended up waiting to eat until we got home  (two hours later) and the food was sooo good! I wasn't a fan of the tacos but I think it was the meat ratio vs the cheese ratio that was off. There was barely any shredded beef and too much cheese but next time I would get carne asada meat. Or skip the tacos and try something else.
 The carne asada nachos were sooo good!  I normally don't like quesadillas but it was so tasty!! I wish we had one by our house. We only get humbertos and there is no comparison! We will definitely be back if we go back to vegas."}
{"text":"This place is kinda hit and miss for some people. Every time I have ate here I have loved it. Granted I'm not ordering complicated things. No matter what time of the day I come they always make my food the same. The restaurant is clean but it doesn't have a drive thru. The busiest times are the weekend nights after everyone is done clubbing they head on over to get some tacos or fries to soak up the alcohol. I suggest coming during the week if you don't want to wait. Some noteworthy entrees are the carne Asada fries(they use nacho cheese instead of shredded cheese), super meat quesadillas, or the double cheeseburgers that are only 5 dollars during the week. To drink stay away from the sodas and hit up the agua Fresca machine. They offer a white drink called Horchata which is a rice based drink,a pineapple flavored water and also Jamaica which is hibiscus flower"}
{"text":"Great location! BUT!! You walk in and the lay out just sucks no real direction where to go/ order. The screens with the menus are so far behind you when you order you have to step back to see what you are really getting. I just always like to make sure I'm getting the right thing. The chairs are way too low and you have to fall into it to sit down. The food honestly was not as good as I thought it should have been. I was thinking they would be more like a Cafe Rio/ Chipotle but it's just another gas station type hole in the wall. Not worth coming back in my opinion. I can see this closing down soon. If they revamp it to have better seating and better flow and organization it can be successful. 

Ps : no napkins. All behind the counter so I didn't like that and they only give you like 3 thin napkins anyway. And there was a small fruit fly that fell from the ice dispenser. It's new, that shouldn't happen!"}
{"text":"What a great find!!  Absolutely the best little Mexican restaurant we have ever ate at.  And it is sooo clean, even kitchen area.  People working there are friendly and courteous!  The plates are generous proportions and delicious.  Wanted to order more food just to take home and eat later.  Give it a try, you will be satisfied!"}
{"text":"Regardless of what my wife says Pepe's Tacos is a great spot. Pepe's Tacos is possibly the most authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. I know that is pretty strong praise given the number of Mexican food establishments in town, but when compared to the food I get in Mexico, Pepe's is closest.   

   My personal favorite item on the menu is the Carne Asada. The asada is always perfectly seasoned, quite tender and juicy.  Whether it's on their super nachos in a super burrito or their tacos, it is the best in town. The carnitas is also a great choice on the tacos or burritos as is the birria (goat). On Tuesday thru Thursday Pepe's has a lunch special that is worth checking out. Four double wrapped tacos and a soda for $5.99. It's one of my regular haunts at lunchtime for sure.   

  You don't have to look any further than the neighborhood where Pepe's is to realize that a crappy Mexican restaurant isn't going to last very long. Pepe's is the real deal for authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas no matter what my wife says!!"}
{"text":"Food is just sub par. The inside looks worn and needs work done. Customer service was horrible 2 Servers stood there talking on the phone laughing and speaking in Spanish the whole time why they were helping us. The whole atmosphere was creepy. Will not go back"}
{"text":"They have  lots  of things for  under six bucks.  I love their shredded cheese on  the Carne Asada quesadilla.  Nice  customer service when  we dined in to  eat.  Don't  share  drinks there  is  a big  sign by the  fountain machine..  I was  shocked they had  a charge on  credit/debit cards.

BRING CASH."}
{"text":"I love tacos! We were there maybe 3-4am. This is a great place to go after a night out in Las Vegas. Because its away from the strip... it's not to packed but its not too empty where you're the only one there. I ordered the Lengua tacos which were really good and frijoles. My favorite! They even gave me chips with my beans. I would go back anyday!"}
{"text":"Their al pastor really stood out for me. The  salsa verde was great and had a good amount of heat. The salsa roja was overly smoky/chipotle-y for my taste. The al pastor burrito or tacos and some salsa verde washed down with a jamaica: Uuummmm.  Worth the drive to a sketchy area."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Me and my homies where the only non Latinos in the facility but it was all love.. Food came..took it home....and 3 hours later I had the shits... But...the food was good . I think I ate like 4 tacos"}
{"text":"This has been hands down my favorite taco place for years. I usually get carne asada tacos but since they have chorizo tacos, I usually get two of those and one carne asada taco and it is just perfect. I will got across town to get this since basically I am.

The horchata is always good, and never feels to watery or unflavored like some other taco places. Beans are always fresh and never tastes processed, and the salsas are delicious. The carne asada nachos are also worth trying. Never had a bad meal here and always well worth the reasonable price."}
{"text":"I came here to have a great lunch after work, ordered a chille relleno burrito and it was pretty good but half way in I encountered a toothpick inside the burrito and it immediately removed my appetite; complained and they offered another one but this is something that shouldn't have happened since the beginning"}
{"text":"The carne asada gordita we had was quite good. the marinade was tasty and the meat wasn't overcooked. The al pastor taco was good but the carnitas taco was better.

There's a good sized dining room that's kept pretty clean. The neighborhood looks like it has the potential to be a little sketchy but while you sit and eat your food and you can daydream about the dance hall across the street and what Vegas must've been like 25 years ago."}
{"text":"worst Mexican food in the world, no taste, all old meat, hard & stale, but good counter service. extremely flimsy cheapest plastic forks and sporks they could find.. very clean and bright though. super-Americanized for northern Caucasian taste-buds. absolutely no spices used....Please shut down asap..  garbage bull-s--t..."}
{"text":"I go here whenever I don't want to cook. LOL :) It's really good. A little pricey, but good. My husband always gets the pastor burrito and is always good! I get a something different when I go and everything is always good. :)"}

{"text":"You can find a taco shop EVERYWHERE here in Vegas.¬† They have a lot of competition.¬† Pepe's is fairly new.¬† They have a few locations.¬† The interior layout of the seating in this location is smartly planned.¬† The tables and floors could use side wipe down and sweep up.¬† But I'm guessing cuz they're quite busy.¬† Mess is expected.¬† I like the ceiling decos.

I had their double chile relleno burrito; Ness got carne asada tacos.¬† Pretty good!¬† Put some more green sauce please!¬† Oh and we had ordered the churro sundae right.¬† Changed our mind and made it just two churros.¬† Rang us up correctly but accidentally they served us the churro sundae.¬† So as not to waste time and effort, she let us keep it.¬† I said I'd pay the difference.¬† But it was their minor error, so dibs for us :D

Highly recommend their churro sundae!¬† And give their chile relleno burrito a try. 3.5***√ó"}
{"text":"Always a good meal at Pepe's.  Good authentic Mexican taqueria.

They have a fresh salsa bar with a tasty red hot sauce and a green one.  Plenty of fresh cut lines, radishes, and pickled jalape√±os.  

The tacos come with a healthy portion of meat.  They have a lot of choices...  We always order the carne asada (steak) and al pastor (marinated pork).

They recently added carne asada fries which was really good.  Think nachos but with fries at the bottom instead of tortilla chips. 

I've had better tacos in LA, but so far in Vegas this is our spot.  I've been to a few of their locations and sometimes the neighborhood is dodgy, but the restaurant is always clean and safe.  One time I talked to the owner, Pepe, and he said he doesn't sell beer because he wants his restaurant to be family friendly."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Pepes several times. Decent portions, good prices and usually pretty tasty. Id' go for a Burrito or a plate over the tacos though. Better value.  Also this is  authentic Mexican. Thumbs up for me."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love every worker. What a wonderful drunken late night stop. The music is poppin. Lov"}
{"text":"If you are very hungry this place is not where you want to go! They gave us our meal about 15 minutes after ordering (there was about 4 people inside) and we ordered a side of caramelized onions and they made us wait an extra 15 minutes for them when we went to ask if it was ready they said they had given them away to someone else. We left after that. The prices have changed and the portions got smaller."}
{"text":"Consider me a huge fan of this local joint that reminds me so much of Oregon's Muchas Gracias.  The food is cheap, the service was great, and  being that its open for 24 hours it makes for a good meal outside of the casino cafes around the city.  This is one of two Pepe's Taco's and while it caters to a largely gringo clientele, I've seen plenty of latin customers during lunch time.

The most simple items such as the picaditas de chorizo, tacos dorados, and carnitas burrito are enough to make any Mexican food lover salivate.  Most items are within the $4-7 range and combinations usually don't exceed $10.  This particular location is not nearly as popular as the sister joint in downtown and the best one to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"I came to this place after looking at the sign for the best Carne asada fries in town everyday for 3 months. Finally decided to try and let's just say that they are not the best Carne asada fries In town. They used nacho cheese for the the topping cheese! Any self respecting Mexican restaurant would not use nacho cheese on top of Carne asada fries. Plus the service was not that great either. I entered in when nobody was there. Right after me 5 people arrived. I ordered first but three of the people got their food way before mine. Will not be returning here"}
{"text":"Everything about this experience was bad, didn't get to see what the food was like because the added something I asked them not to , then got upset with me cause their mess up talking about save the burrito when she could clearly see the mess up on the receipt,  to top it off it took them a week to take money out . I would never spend another dollar at this place"}
{"text":"Small tacos, high prices, and dumb policies.... Trying reeeeal hard to be nice and give them that second star.

I was here a few months ago but drunk out of my mind and I couldn't have written my Yelp-worthy review based on my tipsy experience. I decided to stop by the other day and I guess you have to be drunk to really appreciate this place.

Located off Flamingo and Rainbow, Pepe's is a 24 hour taco/Mexican fast food spot in the same vein as Robertos. They have about 6 or 7 different types of meat for their tacos along with plenty of burritos, combo plates, and other standard Mexican offerings.

The tacos were small and at about two bucks a pop definitely not worth it. They only use one small corn tortilla so everything gets soggy and falls out on the plate. =( booo! The carne asada was lacking in flavor and a little dry, likewise the chorizo was nothing memorable. The salsa bar was a disaster when we came in. The two watery sauces they had were splashed all over the place added little flavor to the tacos. 

What really disappointed me about Pepe's were their stupid policies. 50 cents charge for using a credit card, 30 minute limit for eating-in and they even had the nerve to post  sign on the soda fountain about extra charges if you are caught sharing a drink. All these rules and fees make eating their mediocre food more of a hassle than it should be.

If you are looking for an authentic tacos hit up Tacos El Gordo, better tacos, cheaper prices, no stupid rules."}
{"text":"I've remembered a lot from this restaurant and have had many memories. Although it may be a little tacky on some looks and quite pricy from some of the selections and specials now, I still think this is one of the best joints para comida Mexicana in Vegas. I would recommend either the cheeseburger (they actually do burgers), the wet chorizo and egg burrito or the al pastor tacos (although I did wish they included pineapple in them like the street ones, still good though con salsa)."}
{"text":"This place lost my business forever. I got a double cheeseburger and meat was all dried up and it gad a bit of a smell to it. I went to let them know of the quality and tgey said they make it everyday. I told them well let me just change it to something else I'll pay the difference. So she proceeded to charge me full price for second item and all the cashier could say was no refunds. WTF ?? ..hand written sign that read no refunds and no exchanges. That shit is so uncalled for, why would i wanna waste food like that if it actually tasted like shit! Fuck this place that's the last time i encourage friends/family to go there. Stick those 5bucks where they fit so called owner! Hope this place goes bankrupt."}
{"text":"Stopped by here tonight with my husband because Lolo's Chicken and Waffles was closed. We've been to Pepe's before and it's not bad. Tonight I got the three tacos plate with rice & beans. I went with carne asada, al pastor, and pollo. The al pastor is by far my favorite. The chicken was a bit dry. My husband got the super nachos with carne asada. I don't love the fact that they use nacho cheese, and neither does he. It wasn't bad at all, but not something we'd go out of the way to eat. The service is pretty standard."}
{"text":"I came and drove miles away to use a gift certificate. They did not honor it. Guadalupe was the managers name. She was a pleasant lady but still couldn't provide a solution to the problem.  They all looked like seers with headlights. They specifically said they knew nothing of the coupon and did not honor it. The certificate had the location name and address.  I'm sure their food was delicious but they're marketing on the other hand....."}

Honestly the best place to be :)"}

{"text":"We were driving by and saw the 'Best of Las Vegas' award logo and thought we'd give Pepe's a try.  We were very dissapointed.  It is expensive for what you get. My wife ordered two street tacos and some chips. I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito Plate and it was $20. My burrito was half the size of a Roberto's burrito, and so salty I had so slather it with sour cream to make it edible. My wife didn't like the flavor of the Carne Asada Street Tacos either, so salty her lips burned.  The refried beans were dry and awful.  She was also dissapointed they didn't have Pico for the chips.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered asada platter with a WHOLE avocado on the SIDE. They put 3 rotten a-- tiny slices on TOP of his food mixed in with the meat so I couldn't eat it. I went to the lady & showed her the receipt & asked for a WHOLE avocado on the SIDE but it was very hard for her to understand. Finally she asked for my boyfriends plate and I'm like SERIOUSLY?! Freeking ridiculous. My boyfriend was STARVING but I have to go grab his plate so you can pick at it??? So when I gave them the plate she was saying that he's already taken a bite. WELL NO SH-- idiot, its his food & he came here to EAT, RIGHT?! I said \"LISTEN all you had to do was APOLOGIZE & give me a whole avocado on the side instead of picking at my boyfriends food & asking stupid questions.\" So after they pick the avocado out (which is UNACCEPTABLE since I didn't ask them to do) they then gave me another rotten a-- avocado which consisted of 3 tiny SLICES!! Absolutely unacceptable service! I even told the \"manager\" how she handled the situation and she said she was going to handle it yet she didn't apologize to me EITHER nor did she give me a WHOLE AVOCADO which is what we PAID FOR!!! They then proceeded to talk rude sh-- about me in Spanish right in front of me assuming that I don't know Spanish. NICE TRY. LOL So I paid $2.15 for 3 pathetic avocado slices & then I get the worst service ever??? F--- this place & their shi- service. I've never encountered such stingy, petty & incompetent people in my LIFE since moving to Vegas & dealing with Mexicans. They obviously hate white people and think that they can treat them like crap and rob them blind. Unfreekinbelievable."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine once said, \"Pssh, I never come to Pepe's Tacos when I'm sober!\"

I should have listened.

This joint boasts a long wait time for simple to-go orders, bland ingredients, and sub-par salsas. Asking them to hold the sour cream is a good way to ensure you're getting sour cream. Also, be sure to count your change back because I guess math isn't an exact science in this wizard's den."}
{"text":"Over priced, asada fries suck, funny smell... But,  when it comes to midnight taco runs, it's the spot to go! And the horchata is decent..."}
{"text":"I was in the area running some errands and saw Pepe's and decided to give it a try.  As someone else mentioned, the ordering process is a little confusing. There is a huge menu board bigger than the state of Wisconsin smack in front of you. Meanwhile, you don't realize that there are 2 registers open on either side of the fixings bar.  Nonetheless, the manager took my order. He was very helpful and reviewed with me the menu and answered my questions. He told me several times that they have the best tacos in town.  I ended up ordering 3 soft tacos with carne asada and cheese.  While i waited for my order, I noticed a girl cleaning the heck out of the dining room.  You need to get a code for the restroom door.  The restrooms were so clean that you can eat off the floor.  I was super impressed with the cleanliness here.  Someone else mentioned in their review that the seats were too low. OMG, is that person right! I felt like i was going to fall over, the seats were so low.  A few minutes later, my food was delivered and I  had to ask for extra napkins. This is the one thing i cannot stand in a restaurant. Asking for extra napkins is unacceptable and makes a place look cheap.  Unfortunately, the tacos were so salty, that i thought that i was eating fish that was just caught in the Atlantic Ocean.   I'm not sure if the salt was on the sauce, meat, or the cheese but the salt level was astronomical.  I really wish the food would have tasted better. I don't think I would be returning here. Sorry. :("}
{"text":"First time ever eating here. The inside of the restaurant is pretty similar to Roberto's. Wasn't sure what to get but I realized the menu is like Tacos El Gordo. Now I've only been there twice so with the menu in front of me, I still was a bit unfamiliar with what most of the choices were so I got those little soft shell tacos instead. I had Carne Asada tacos, Carnitas tacos, and Al Pastor tacos; two of each but my coworker and I shared them. It tasted just like what I had eaten at Tacos El Gordo but here at Pepe's Tacos, it lacked sour cream, onions, etc. It was an extra charge for it but I think at Tacos El Gordo it comes on it."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Nothing amazing. Customer service was terrible. My dad was Asian and spoke fluent Spanish. The cashier acted like she didn't speak any Spanish which was okay. Another customer came in and guess who learned fluent Spanish in 2.5 seconds? She did. We were order number 45 and 6 other orders (that were ordered after us) came out before number 45. What a great way to treat your customers. I will not be going back ever again."}
{"text":"3 tiny tacos, a drink and chips $9!...if you eat it there. If you order to go they won't give you the chips! This is what the lady told me. Seriously? Won't be back."}
{"text":"The best tacos ever! Full of flavor and meat! Definitely my favorite place to get my tacos from"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Open 24 hours with great food. Their Carne Asada fries are a must. They use nacho cheese so it's super cheesy and if you live sheesh like me father you will love it! 

Their super burritos are very good as well! Beans, cheese, guacamole, and more! If you haven't tried this place yet I definitely recommend stoping by at any time day or night! 

Also if you're out il after a night of drinking and someone in your group doesn't feel like Mexican they make a pretty damn good burger as well!"}
{"text":"The food is OKAY. Definitely a one time never again thing. We tried the soft tacos (carnitas) , enchiladas, and the asada fries. It was edible but definitely not worth coming again. Have definitely eaten better. Meat was chewy, color wasnt right, and my stomach hurt after the fact. 

Good luck if you decide to eat here. Hopefully you get a better experience

But there's a reason the reviews aren't ALL THAT..."}

{"text":"I remember when this was originally \"Miller's Steakhouse\". That place was no good but, Pepe's took over years ago and it seems to have stuck. Being a fan of Pepe's in Cali I was always hesitant about trying this place. I didn't know if it was the same or completely different. With only one way to find out I headed on my way. 

The parking lot was packed. I was lucky to nab the last spot. It was busy inside. I placed my order and waited maybe 8-10 minutes for my food. I saw others waiting too so I knew it might be a minute and they were cooking it fresh. I ordered the \"Carne Asada Burrito\" and the \"Cheese Quesadilla\". The tortillas are yummy. The burrito was good in size and tasted decent but wasn't spectacular. The real winner was the quesadilla. It was cheeeeeesy! 

I noticed a sign inside that said they only accepted cash however the cashier asked me if I wanted to pay with cash or debit. 

Pepe's is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Ok so I came here the night before Christmas.... I had a stomach ache after... I gave it three stars because I'm still not sure if it was because of the tacos or because I had too much to drink the night before. 

The food was ok. I might go back. But the thing I didn't like was that I asked for a side of cheese and they charged me $1.99... Crooks!!!!!


The tacos I ordered were a $1.79 and a side of cheese was $1.99!!!!!????? Anyhow, I know what not to order. Along with the chicken tacos I ordered a crane asada burrito that was pretty good. Not too spicy. It was perfect! That I would order again.

My little cousins ordered the fries and they topped them off with spice which actually tasted pretty good. 

The parking out front was good. The place had a lot of seating. 

Like I said I may go back buy ask them to \"hold the cheese\"."}

When you want some yummy, inexpensive tacos or burritos this is the place to go."}

{"text":"I reviewed this location several months ago, but for some reason it disappeared. My family and I frequent the AMC Theatre next door. We were happy when it opened, since it was very convenient to go there before a movie. When they first opened, the food was edible. It is not any more. The quality of the food has gone way down. I saw the comments about napkins and we had to bring our own. How cheap can you get? The food was so bad the last time we were there after making the same item three times. I spoke to the owner and he invited me back at no charge. We have not been back and will not even eat the food for free. I wonder if the owner reads the reviews? If so, he really needs to clean house. His employees could care less about taking care of customers and the quality of the food they serve. It is obvious by now, that the owner never looks at the comments made on Yelp. He should and address the issues customers have taken the time to post. If you have any issues, you should call the owner. His name is Ricardo and he can be reached at 702.646.0300. Maybe, if he receives more calls, he might get a better picture of what is going on at his restaurant."}

The orders have been incomplete a couple of times also. Their customer skills are almost nonexistent."}
{"text":"Just went to Pepe's Tacos and ordered 9 tacos. I was surprised when the cost with tax came to $19.46. That seems very expensive for just tacos but I figured they must be crazy good or crazy big. When they handed me one tiny paper bag I had to ask them if they made a mistake. I checked and inside were 9 tiny tacos that should have not cost more than .99 cents on a good day. And after just sharing the 9 with two friends We all agree they were mediocre at best and still very hungry. Save yourself the money and go to another taco shop, I wish I had."}
{"text":"My dad makes the BEST taco's In the WORLD, then Taqueria De Anda In Fullerton CA, then Pepe's In 3rd place. you want to order fresh \"agua de Pina or Jaimaca\" (Pineapple juice or hibiscus tea) to down the \"Taco's de pastor\" (marinated pork Tacos). Try the Carne Asada Fries...It's The Real Thing!!!"}
{"text":"This business is a health hazard. I ordered a menudo, and there was metal brush pieces inside my menudo. I took it to the register to show the employee, and they didnt do anything, they returned back the same menudo to me. They didnt apologize, they didnt offer a new menudo, very bad service."}
{"text":"Ok, it's getting 2 stars because they screwed up my order, even after explicitly telling them what I wanted (it was a simple request - NO ONIONS) 
That's the quickest way for a place to drop in ratings for me...

Aside from that, the food was, uh, ok. I got the carne asada burrito, which was mostly grisly chunks of beef with some rice and beans.

As I stated, I'm a no onion eating mofo, and as luck would have it, the jalapeno/carrots/onions mix was, you guessed it, 99% onions. No thanks. Picky you say? Why yes i am.

Other than that, it was a good place to cool off from the sun"}
{"text":"Had the carne asada plate flavor of the meat was amazing had to get 4 extra tortillas at a great price of 89 cents because there was so much food on my plate I ended up with 8 big tacos for 9.99 going there tomorrow can't wait"}
{"text":"From the outside it looked to be an above average size whole-in-the-wall place. I had a good feeling about it just based upon that!

I have only eaten here once, a few weeks ago when I was in town. The bro-in-law took me here, raving about the street style tacos. He wasn't kidding. I ordered two carne asada (steak), two carnitas (pork) and two lengua (tongue). All three were EXCELLANTE! None of the meats were dry and all were very tasty! Their salsa bar, with marinated carrots, were good to go! The Horchata (rice drink) was one of the better ones I have experienced. Oh yeah, they throw down some refried beans and chips on your plate too. Enjoyed them also.

You know you've walked into an old school, authentic tasting, restaurant when 3/4 of the customers are our Border Brothers & Sisters! With a ratio of the other 1/4 being us Gringos you know it's good food and service. If it was in a white bread neighborhood the percentages would probably be flipped.

No, I did not get the shits afterwards LMAO.......... I'll be swinging by on our next trip to Lost Wages!"}
{"text":"I love some Pepe's Tacos. Tacos are full of meat, and the menudo is really good. Service is always friendly, and they are open all the time. Super convenient and their salsa is pretty good. I especially love how they switch up the music, one spanish song, and then an english song song. My boyfriend is white and when we walked in, the music changed. Obviously, it was not on purpose, but still super funny. haha. Love this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for good Mexican food since we moved here 9 months ago. We have yet to find it...
We both ordered the super steak burritos which were just ok. The quesadilla was super greasy, but kinda yummy. Super spicy red salsa was great. Horchatas were ok from what I've experienced. The cleaning crew was using some chemical that caused most everyone to sneeze. They continued to mop around everyone for the entire time that we were there. It was extremely unappetizing. 
All in all it was just ok and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ok, so I was in the mood for authentic Mexican food today and wanted to try something new....so I headed towards the hood.  I figured I'd find something good there.

As I passed by Pepe's, I've seen this place a 1000 times since I've lived in Vegas, but never stopped.  I did today.

It was pretty busy in the restaurant and I was glad to see a typical menu for a taco shop....reminds me of when I lived in SoCal.  I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito and a bottle of Mexican Orange Soda....I love their soda because it's made with Natural Sugar and not High Fructose Corn Syrup.

Anyway, my burrito came out and I was pleased to see it was a good size...not too big and not too small.  I went to the salsa bar and got some of their spicy red salsa.  The burrito was ok....I thought the Carne Asada was too salty, but it had good flavor....the beans were good....the rice was dry....and the salsa in the burrito was ok.

Overall, the experience didn't blow me away.  It was a good visit, but not the one I was hoping for.  I guess next time, I'll have to go deeper into the hood.

Will I return?  eh...not sure."}
{"text":"So excited this location opens next to the AMC. My hubby tried 3 tacos plate: carne, al pastor, & another one. He loved it! 
I had a carne asada quesadilla and added guacamole on the side. Delicious! Friendly service, very clean restaurant. 
Only thing I'd suggest management change, do NOT charge customers a fee for using their debit/credit card. Thankfully we had cash but I could see other customers annoyed. That's a cost an owner should always eat, not an already paying customer. 
We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"1st time here....food & service was amazing! I tried the carne asada super burrito. Wow! It was huge & Super flavorful. The meat was quality. 
Cake was moist & yummy! 
Awesome value for the food. The ladies behind the counter were very friendly! 
We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When you're hungry and it's 1am, this is a quick spot to get some Mexican food. However, because I am gluten free and pescatarian I left very unsatisfied with the food itself. The customer service was on plaint and she knew exactly what to suggest when I mentioned I don't eat meat or gluten. The cashier suggested that I make breakfast tacos with scrambled eggs, beans and cheese. She mentioned that she wouldn't be able to make them but she could give me the ingredients to do so. The eggs came out cold and the corn tortillas were thick and steamed which didn't make a good taco. All in all, cold and bland with a soggy tortilla was a disappointment. They were also cleaning out the Horchaga at the time so that was a bummer as well, but I can't fault them for that."}
{"text":"Who would have thought you could find a fresh, amazing tasting, Al Pastor all-meat burrito and carnitas tacos at a quarter after 1 in the morning?
Great salsa bar, too.
This squeaky-clean restaurant is a real stand out, considering the slightly sketchy location.
If I didn't live 400 miles away, I'd eat here five times a week!
This is the best Mexican fast-food I've ever eaten and, I live on the stuff!
Will definitely be back, there is a lot more on the menu I have got to try."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best tacos you will find in vegas. I personally always get the carne asada tacos and lengua. The carne asada is never dry tasting like other places so flavorful & delicious!  The lengua so tender and the flavor is wow! If you eat there they will give you beans and chips the beans are no bland at all. I've been coming for 5 years and I will continue to. Oh yeah the red salsa is so good!!!!"}
{"text":"The line formation blocks the toppings station. The lids and straws are not in the same area as the drinks. You pick up the food where you order. The seating is unorganized. Food was decent though. Just needs to be renovated."}
{"text":"I'm only judging \"this\" one. I had two beef hard shell tacos and a chicken burrito.

Tacos I appreciated. I liked the shells. Flavor was fine but not amazing. Many chunks of meat were very big and much of the meat was as tough as beef jerky. Maybe it was the time I got there. Around 11 pm. May have simmered all day and lost its tenderness. 

The burrito was filled with everything. Good size. $8 and dry rice. But the chicken was perfect. 

Basically, my experience was average, if I were to go again I would get chicken tacos and be happy."}
{"text":"Servings are small and they charge a 50 cent fee to use debit or credit card. They lost a customer and I hope many more."}
{"text":"Love the place we always come when we visit vegas..this is our favor mexican restaueant...service  it's great.."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite taco joint.  Very good food, authentic and I always leave wishing I would have ordered more!  Been here on two separate occasions now and food was great both times.  The restaurant is extremely spacious not a small hole in the wall like most other places.  Plenty of choices for drinks as well, including a pineapple, horchata or house version of fruit punch.  I literally am willing to sneak away from the office even though it's a 10 minute drive.

I've ordered shredded beef tacos, chicken tacos and the rice n' beans.  Never leaves an empty plate and it's shocking to me, because most Mexican restaurants can't get the rice right.  All homemade ingredients and what a bargain for the prices.  Definitely bookmarked for when I'm in the area or need a taco fix."}
{"text":"The service and the food were great. The pastor burrito was amazing. I love how it had grilled onions in it; it made it so flavorful. The meat was seasoned just right and was such a good quality. It wasn't full of gristle or fat like other places."}
{"text":"By all means don't go here! Their prices are misleading! They don't have a menu with pictures to know what you mr paying for. I got 3 small ass tacos and a drink \" they called a special\" for $7.79! And a credit card fee of .50$ so, with a small ass taco and small size drink all came to $8.92! Should went to del taco and get a fiesta pack for less and more food!

Oh! Also, they should add rice and beans to the order for the price your getting for. Overall! Telling all friends and family not to attend any your restaurant. Roberts is better!!"}
{"text":"The lady that took our order needs customer service skills. The food is very expensive considering the way we were treated. I will never go back."}
{"text":"A coworker and I had to run some errands in the adjacent strip mall so figured we'd stop by Pepe's for lunch. Unfortunately, that was a huge mistake.

We got the chicken quesadilla combo and a carne asada burrito. First off, \"combo\" just means a drink is supposed to be included; it doesn't come with rice or beans or sides. Worse yet, the quesadilla managed to be both bland and really, really greasy, which seems like a cardinal sin. The burrito was also lousy - it was more like really dry ground beef than carne asada. It was small, too, making the value proposition quite suspect.

And there's a reason I said that the combo means a drink is \"supposed\" to be included; after I got my CC receipt, I noticed they'd charged us for an extra drink. The same lady who processed my order refused to credit the CC and wanted to pay me back in cash instead, but when she gave me cash she only gave me back the menu price of the drink (without the sales tax, which they charged). I had to talk to another person to get them to understand that they also owed me the sales tax.

I can't shake the feeling that this wasn't a mistake, since I never asked for a drink in the first place (since it was supposed to have been included in my combo); they just arbitrarily charged me for one. Also, not a single person apologized during this whole interaction.

Finally, they charge $.50 to use a CC. Bad value proposition, lousy food, shady cashiers, and still nickel+diming us on top of all that? No thanks."}
{"text":"The food is really good but they have horrible service i went last week and the cashier rosario has an attitude problem and its not the first time. never going to eat there again i hope she gets replace"}
{"text":"This place is adorable and delicious. I'm pregnant and pretty much nothing tastes good, and yet this was amazing. That made a huge impact on me. I got the super burrito with chicken, and from the first bite, I was happy with the world. Ingredients are fresh and the food is amazing. The restaurant is also clean and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday evening and the place is okay. The lady assisting was nice, but the food however SUCKED I had order 2 burritos de asada and a taco de asada for my Bf and I. The meat was very dried after I told the lady I wanted a little bit of beans multiple times I ended up getting them with a ton of beans. Long story short both of us are now in bed with food poisoning puking our lives away.. This is the WORST PEPE'S I've been to never again am I going back there I rather eat at Taco y Taco or Tacos el Gordo."}
{"text":"2.5 stars
This is my second time ever coming to this location. I'm from SoCal so I was here last year in September and tried the carne asada quesadilla which was way to greasy and the asada was not the best. It was dry, hard and flavorless. 
I came here last night and ordered the combination burrito which was actually good and the carne asada fries which sucked. The asada was the same as last time. I knew I should of stayed away from the asada but I figured give it another try. 
The sour cream tasted way to sour to the point where I questioned if it was past due. The guacamole is not freshly made and the nacho cheese is watered down. Definitely not worth the price. This place is not on the cheap side. 
According to Pepe's, the asada fries are the best in Vegas? LoL WTF for reals? Nah I make the best and I've had a lot better. So sad if people in Vegas  consider these fries the best around town. 
The cashier was really, really nice. Hard to find that type of service now and days. 
Never thought I would be back to this spot, but since I'm now a Vegas residence for the time being and was in the area I decided to give them another shot. If I ever return I would definitely get the burrito again. Their is a condiment bar. The radishes looked old and had black spots all over them. The salsas lacked flavor. They offer horchata, jamaica, pina and sodas. The taste is ok. It's free refills, so I ain't tripping. You don't really see that anywhere else. But again, I've had better."}
{"text":"I mean for the price and the quality of food I think this is really place, down and dirty and delicious and does not cost much at all."}
{"text":"I like this place because it's cheap and good .  Tacos are good and staff  Is very friendly"}
{"text":"Ah, it's OK.  Not the worst for me but not the greatest either.

Off the suggestion of the wifey who's office is less than a 10 minute drive away from Pepe's Tacos, we ended up going because her officemates eat here quite frequently.  Who knew this little unassuming eatery had a 'Best of Las Vegas' vote!  I was a bit suspect from the outside of things.  But once you go inside, it's a different story.  Place was surprisingly tidy!  Far from the shizzhole I was half-expecting to walk into.  You got me there, Pepe.

Get inside and you're hit with a flash of neon and the shine of aluminum siding.  Menus are smack dab in the middle of the restaurant, and wow does Pepe and crew love yellow & red!  Menus are all done up in this color scheme.  Does kinda make you get hungry!  

Looked over the menu and noticed that it's very similar to other Mexican eats around town.  More on the authentic side of things, less of the Taco Bell/Del Taco/Chipotle sort.  Which I don't mind at all.  If you see a bunch of Latinos eating here, then the place must have SOME sort of street cred.  All good in the hood I say, all good.

I really had it out for one of their 'Super' burritos, so I got one with carne asada.  Wifey was jonesin' for fish so she got the fried tilapia plate.  Kid was in the mood for fries so she got an order of carne asada fries, with guacamole on the side (kid hates guac ever since her incident at El Pollo Loco, but that's another story).  Is it me, or is it kinda rude to tell patrons they can't share a drink cup, and if folks are seen sharing it's an extra charge??  Yes, there is a sign for that.  I thought it strange but we bought TWO cups for drinks where I would normally just buy one so we can all share.  Save some money, right?  I shared a drink with my wife and for once my kid got her own drink.  Oh no, I shared!  Call the Care Bear police!  But really, it's my drink I can do what I want to.  I shared, and I didn't get charged extra.  But I did get a dirty look or two.  Gotta say though, mix equal parts of their pineapple drink with their hibiscus drink...refreshing!  Their horchata isn't bad either.

Food arrives after around 10 minutes which is OK in my book, so I know it's not fast food.  Helped myself to the salsa bar, and loaded up on pickled jalapenos & carrots, sliced radishes, and limes & cilantro as well.  I like color when I eat!

My carne asada 'Super' burrito was alright.  It included steak, beans, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream.  It was pretty good, but I found it somewhat lacking in heft like I'm used to.  Could have used more carne asada.  I should have opted for the combination burrito instead, which comes with meat, beans, rice, onions, cilantro, and salsa.  Would have saved me $1 too over the 'Super' burrito.  

Wifey said her fried tilapia plate was tasty.  Came with a nice sized full fried tilapia, rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and a side of flour or corn tortilla.  Fish was fried just right, not oily and not overcooked, very juicy.  Beans and rice were nothing out of the ordinary, but their fresh made tortillas were delicious.

Kid was happy with here HEAPING mound of carne asada over some fat French fries.  Fries were cooked well, not soggy, and covered with copious amounts of nacho cheese (oh yeah definitely from a can), steak, sour cream, and guacamole (on the side of course).  She liked them a lot, but got full after about half an order.  Leftovers!  Nothing like congealed blobs of meat & cheese over cold potatoes later.  #drunkeats

I wasn't overly impressed with Pepe's Tacos but I did enjoy the taste of their food.  For us, it was cooked fresh & right.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for a burrito, but if I was in the neighborhood (oh man that would be rare) I would stop in for a bite to eat.  Or maybe a drink.  That I will share.

Arriba!"}
{"text":"Pepe's is my ULTIMATE FAVORITE mexican restaurant ever!!!  I live all the way in Henderson and I'm always down to drive the distance for this place.  I usually get their carne asada soft tacos and I've never been disappointed.  The great thing about this place is that they're open 24 hours a day and the food is pretty cheap.  Lots of my Mexican friends have said Pepe's food is just as good as a homecooked meal.  It's a bit of a drive from the strip but it's worth the visit."}
{"text":"I was looking for good tacos, I've been to tacos el gordo but its so hard to eat there(long lines, no tables available so overrated) so my family and I decided to try these and the we're so good! I have tacos my sister had a al pastor quesadilla and brother had carne Asada fries the only thing I can complain is the cashier was rude when there was an incident with food but that didn't phase me so it's whatever. Overall really good, definitely choose over tacos el gordo"}
{"text":"Best chile rellano I've had in Vegas at any price.  Had the three taco plate, the carne asada on a handmade corn tortilla with cilantro, onion and  roasted chile salsa were all solidly delicious.  Skip the nachos/fries unless you like liquid cheese.  Other than that the frescas and salsa bar is well stocked and the bathrooms were clean despite some tagging, all around great grub choice on Decatur!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try Pepes carne asada fries as they advertise the best in Vegas!
We walked in to no greet as an employee mopped the.floor and the cook looked at us didn't say anything disappeared we waited for someone to come to take our order finally another lady comes out to do so. I didn't like how you can't see much of the cooking taking place.

Highly disappointed we wasted over half of our food there were no beans as another user said bland guacamole no pico de gayo and CANNED CHEESE SAUCE!!! You've got to be kidding me!! There is absolutely NO comparison to Roberto's!!"}

{"text":"Hot hot hot Great tacos I lived in LA for 15 years and this is the only place I found in vegas that does it like they do in LA"}
{"text":"Muy mal servicio, duramos mas de 50 minutos esperando para que nps sirvieran unos tacos y quesadilla de Pollo.
Creo que fueron a matar y desplar al pollo.
Y ademas cobran muy caro como si fuera in servicio de 5 estrellas."}
{"text":"Yuck. I got their carne asada fries sans the meat and they were smothered in this nasty nacho cheese sauce from a can (at least it tasted like it). The fries were soft, their salsa was flavorless, the restaurant was kind of dirty, it was just an overall a disappointing experience and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Wow!! Just wow! I love little dive restaurants like this!! The food was soooo good! My boyfriend and I got the carniasada nachos and a combination burritos, I did mine wet with green sauce (a bit spicy) but good. I love the vibe of the restaurant and the music was nice too. Very clean and good friendly service. Definitely will go again!"}
{"text":"Their street tacos are gross..... I once had a chicken taco that had not one piece of edible meat in it..... nothing but knotty fatty weird pieces of chicken.  The carne asada is even worse.I'm a serious street taco person and my wife loves their shredded tacos but every time I give this place another shot I'm severely grossed out. You can hear them hacking up the taco meat in the back not caring what they're cutting through then they pick nothing out and throw it on a shell . I'll be going to Frijoles and frescas down the street from now on where I've been several times and never got anything gnarly in my meat."}
{"text":"Everybody hyped this place up and honestly I've had real authentic Mexican food before. This place is not it!!  The prices are regular just like their food. It's literally nothing special about it. Their horchata is not even fire. Like I mean I guess if you near by and was over populated by vote like me then eat here lol. I had no choice. 

I asked for some extra cheese on my carne asada fries she tried to charge me almost $3 just for a drizzle of queso. I was over it. 

Their burritos look dry asf and it is NOT the best carne asada fries in Las Vegas. Like no. 

I'm sticking with Taco Y Taco

Oh wait their taco here was good and over filling. It was a lot of guac queso and crema I think I paid like $4 for one taco. I will go back for a taco. But anything else. No sir !!"}
{"text":"I love their fries. I squeezed lime juice on them and they were amazing! The outer crunch and seasoning paired with the zest of lime was awesome. 

As for the other foods we ordered I can't give an opinion yet because I haven't eaten anything else yet. However, I can say that the portions and price are fabulous!

Service was quick and friendly. 

Will update on the rest of the food we got later."}
{"text":"At the oddly shaped corner where Charleston and Fremont Street become Boulder Highway, in one of the older and more dangerous parts of east Vegas, you can find a great taco 24 hours a day at Pepe's!  For 7 or 8 dollars you'll get a huge pile of authentic Mexican food.  I'm partial to the Super Burrito with Carne Asada, or the Huevos Rancheros - yes they serve breakfast all day!  Que gusta!  Very authentic joint.  Makes a great contrast to the Strip casinos if you want to cruise down Charleston for a break from the contrived slot palaces of MGM and Harrahs.  

You might even see a real live mugging - just be careful it isn't you!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars on food, 2 stars on service! So 3 stars is what they deserve I think. 

Let's me start by saying that food is actually not bad! For a kinda fast food Mexican at 12:30 at night! I enjoyed the asada enchiladas. Came w rice,beans and Mexican salad is what I called it; lettuce and tomatoes. Portion was pretty big! Ordered extra sour cream like I always do everytime I eat Mexican food :) 

Husband ordered pastor taco and asada quesadillas. I think he enjoyed my enchiladas more than his food though because he kept on picking on mine. 

Salsa station was pretty clean; they have bunch of lime cut (some Mexican restaurant don't fill their salsa station) they have red radishes just like typical Mexican restaurant and they have chopped onion and cilantros! That alone seriously made me happy!! I love cilantros and onions! 

Now let's move on to the service! The Lady that is taking our order is also running around doing Togo order, putting stuff on the bag, helping with food in the back, and answering phone calls while taking your orders! We found that pretty inefficient! And w  saw a lot of people on the back just talking and so I think maybe if the kitchen stuff would prepare the to go order and just put it out there already bagged it would work so much better for all. It took her about 10mnts to take our order and by the time we were waiting and all set and done there were about 15people behind us! It was pretty chaotic! Am not sure if it's only that night and they were short staff or what but we saw 6 people in the kitchen standing around though and 2 cook! So we weren't sure on what was going on there. I guess next time we'll figure it out! But other than that food came out pretty fast!"}
{"text":"Super delicious tacos at a reasonable price. They also have a great selection of meats, including goat! And, to top it off... They're open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! The employees are nice and they are 24/7!! 
Try there nachos and tacos!!!"}
{"text":"The food was so-so. The place was clean and the service was decent. Ordered the carne asada fries and actually think the meat, sour cream and guacamole would've been better on fresh tortilla chips than on fries. Also would've preferred real shredded cheese vs. liquid cheese. Overall, I'd only give it 2 stars. Was more fast food Mexican than what we'd prefer."}
{"text":"We love this place but every time we come here they always seem to be hiring a taquero or cashier which makes me question how they treat their employees."}
{"text":"Pepe's is ok I prefer the one on Boulder and Flamingo. Price is a bit higher than Robertos I think. Quality depends on the cook at the time you go. I don't like that they don't accept credit cards, but I understand what small businesses need to do to maximize profits."}
{"text":"After moving all of our things to our new home, my fiancee and I ran across Pepe's Tacos and were excited to try this place that we hadn't tried before. My carne asada burrito was really good! Not to mention that they got my order right. This place even had horchata and aqua de pina! We will be back to try more of their food and their drinks."}
{"text":"Pepe's Tacos is surprisingly good but I had to remove some stars because there just isn't a lot of meat in there... You have a burrito stuffed with everything but it's totally lacking in the meat department. I see these photos of tacos stuffed with meat, but you don't get to see what's inside of the burritos! touche!"}
{"text":"CONFIRMED FOOD POISIONING TWICE!!!! 

Here's the story, 

The first week of January I had some undercooked chicken for lunch, I was worried about it all day, I went to Pepe's for dinner and had their all meat al pastor burrito. after I ate it I felt really sick and thought \"oh here we go, that chicken is going to kill me.\" 

I had a bout with that food poisoning for a week straight, total dehydration Doctor said I had to let it all pass... I was very sick and missed a whole week of work. 

Come last night, I go to Pepe's with a friend again, I order the same thing, and last night I had burps that smelled like death and the bubble guts again, terror crossed my mind as if maybe it wasn't the chicken, maybe it was this al pastor burrito that had caused the problems... lo and behold by 6am today i'm throwing out water out of the wrong end and it's not pretty, stomach grumbling, things churning, burping still continuing, even right now i can still smell the death in the burps. I bought some apple cider vinegar that i'm about to wash my system with because i'll be darned if i'm going to let this crap keep me down for another week... wish me luck people and avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"My girlfriend, myself and a friend of ours went to grab some food one night... all 3 of us ended up having food poisoning for the next two days. DIRTY DINNING FORSURE."}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of Mexican places in Las Vegas, both chain restaurants and mom/pop places. I liked most of them and none of them compare to how awful this place is.  Tried it with my wife and kids in 10/07/16.  Everything was simply disgusting.  Unfriendly service and the food is not edible, just horrible. It's just a parody on meat, potatoes, bean, etc.   

After I asked 4 times to make sure the chicken I was ordering was breast meat only and receiving affirmative answers each time, what I got was disgusting pieces of skin with some dark meat attached to it. They lie blatantly.  

My wife ordered pork and received over-fired crisp chunks of pig skin with beans, chips, and potatoes that tasted nothing like the foods we know. If some health and food inspector truly checks this place, these guys will have to get busted.  

A special touch was the server brining the food out of the kitchen and yelling the order numbers out in SPANISH ONLY.  I tried to understand and double checked in English - she just brushed me off rudely  - \"NO, YOU ORDER NO READY!\"  

Worst experience at an eatery in Las Vegas for us so far!  I couldn't eat the disgusting plate of food I was given and went home hungry!"}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of Pepe's Tacos over on E. Charleston. We would head over there after a night of clubbing and get some tacos to soak up the alcohol. I have tried most of their tacos and the carne asada fries and they were delish. I remmber the meat being really nice and juicy, not fatty at all. So I was excited to see that they were going to be opening another place by my house, I was looking forward to some delicious tacos! 

Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the tacos we ordered. We tried tacos de lengua, buche, carnitas and asada and we didn't really like them. They were not at all like I remembered them to be. The quality of the meat could've been better.

Maybe I'll return for the carne asada fries."}
{"text":"Horrible taco place.  Do not eat here.  We ordered pastor and asada tacos, asada fries and some chicken taquitos.

The pastor was flavorless, just tasted like pork.  The asada was also flavorless and had a lot of gristle in it, it was actually hard to eat.  Which made the asada fries suck.  The fries had cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese.  I like a combination of both.  Chicken taquitos were the best part of the meal and that's not saying much.  How can u screw up a taquito, it's just stuffed and fried. 

Will never be back and I will steer people away."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here after seeing a movie at a major theater right next door to it. We should have had a clue when we walked in and there were empty tables everywhere. My wife and I ordered a burrito and 3 tacos. Remember that there were only 3 other people in the place. 20 minutes later still no food. Finally the cashier looked into it and for whatever reason our order was never made. I watched them \"throw\" together our order. The carne asada in my burrito was so fatty and tough that I couldn't chew it and had to spit into a napkin several bites. My wife didn't even finish her tacos. I used their restroom and halfway through the bathroom lights timer clicked off and left me in the dark. I had to use my cell for light to finish. No way I would go back there. And it is a shame since it is directly next to a theater. Hopefully the staff will start caring about the quality of their food and some good ole fashioned PR."}
{"text":"Favorite place to stop on my way home from downtown. Just like the tacos u get on the streets in mexico city. But better quality beef."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of friends tonight and I was not impressed. Each order was cooked separately and a side order that was purchased was never made until I went back up to the counter to remind them. If the place was busy this might be understandable but there was only one other person in the place when we walked in. The food was ok but I will stick with Roberto's from now on as their food is better and less expensive."}
{"text":"A pregnant girl can literally at most anything, for me, to give this place 1 star is bad. This was mainly for the chicken tacos, they're facking garbage! No, I've literally saw garbage that would probably taste better than the .99 crunchy chicken tacos. 

We saw a sign that had advertised .99 chicken taco Wednesday, and we're usually loyal to Roberto's but after the gym we said, what the hell, let's try them. We walked in and ordered and the cashier was nice and all, and I'd say within 3 minutes I got the 10 tacos I ordered. The first downside was they had tomatoes and I HATE TOMATOES. It didn't say they came with them on there, so I was a little irritated. Being pregnant, your smells are amplified, so needless to say I wanted to puke over the smell of them. We got in the car and left.

Upon arriving home, I put some salt, since the chicken (what little they put in there) was bland, some red salsa (FUCKING GROSS) and limon. I lifted my taco and the filling started to fall out. So here's the thing, the chicken to lettuce ratio is stupid, they put maybe a tablespoon on this disgusting, tasteless chicken in there and pile on wet lettuce and wet tomatoes. The box had water and tomatoes water on the bottom, and because they're too cheap to individually wrap the tacos, it made the crunchy shells wet and nasty. Not only that, but my tacos were cold, just from our 3 minute trip home. You know why? BECAUSE THEY'RE FUCKING CHEAP AND HARDLY PUT ANY CHICKEN IN THE TACOS. And perhaps because they may have been sitting there before we actually ordered them. I know this, Roberto's is a 15 minute drive home, and the tacos are still nice and hot when we get home.

The chicken in these tacos is seriously gross, it was sorta gray and tasted like old chicken. Perhaps the leftovers from the days before... good way to get rid of chicken by offering cheap tacos. It was even shredded, just like, a glob. 

I can easily put down 3-5 tacos, but I could barely eat 2. The tacos were just, terrible. They deep fried the shit out of them, and the taste was just horrible. I will never betray Roberto's again. 

Just say no to taco Wednesday here!! Puras pinche mamadas!!!"}
{"text":"Cold over priced old food. i do not now how people go there?"}
{"text":"I've never written a bad review but this one is worth sharing. Cashier was obviously flustered and not in a great mood. Ordered crispy shredded beef tacos, carnitas soft tacos, and al pastor soft tacos. First they got the order wrong and tried to insist we accept the rolled tacos they made instead of the crispy shredded beef tacos we ordered. Why make it awkward for us having to insist we get what we ordered? (and yes, it was correct on the receipt).  
So I started eating my food while my hubby waited for his correct order. No problem. As we're waiting we overhear another patron talking to an employee about his shredded beef being hard and inedible. When my husband finally received his order it was the same. Sooo dry it seemed like beef jerky. It looked horrible, I don't even understand how they could serve this to people with a strait face. My hubby will eat just about anything and not complain but this was just plain gross. 
I gave them 2 stars because the woman that handled returning our money for the 2 bad tacos was pleasant and their bathrooms were clean. 
With so many better options I don't think I'll ever go back. 
There...my first bad review and I don't even feel bad about it, hopefully it will steer other Yelpers to a better place."}
{"text":"Great Place! Great Staff! Clean and Great Atmosphere. Food is awesome and the place is not a Chain, it is a local Mexican Food Place with several other great locations throughout Las Vegas. I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible! The ladies at the front are rude and act like 5 chips (literally 5 chips) is going to cost a fortune and come out of their pay checks if you ask for some. I ordered a taco plate and asked for some chips on the side. Not a side order but just 5 chips and she acted like it was huge thing. 5 chips which probably will cost the restaurant less than 1 penny will now lose me a customer. I wish I knew the ladies name. She was wearing purple polo, is fairly skinny and was working on 5/7/15 at 12:30p

Horrible service. And food was average. I'm never coming back here again because of this cheap woman! Food was aight!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food therefore I am very critical of it. I really wasn't too impressed with this place. First off, before entering the restaurant there was a nasty stench in the air that smelled like pee. It was gross. There was also a homeless guy outside the restaurant begging for change. I ordered the carne asada burrito and Al pastor taco as well as a horchatta drink. The burrito was a super burrito so it included rice, meat, sour cream, and so on. The burrito was okay. I've definitely had better. I actually liked the taco better than the burrito. The horchatta drink that I ordered didn't taste all that great either. It lacked flavor for some reason. Overall, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Prices are higher  , burrito is smaller. 8.99 now for a super burrito.  Sorry but your pricing yourself right out. Coming from cali, it's hard to find a good burrito in vegas, doesn't mean I'm going to spend 10 bucks on a all burrito either. So disappointed"}
{"text":"I've never been to Pepe's Tacos but have heard good things about it. This location is the one closest to my house. On one hungry evening, I was craving tacos. And so to Pepe's Tacos we went!

You can find Pepe's Tacos located in the same plaza as La Bonita and Lee's Liquor on Rainbow. This building is pretty big and is and very clean. 

We ordered tacos: asada, carnitas, al pastor, and a chicken quesadilla. Along with that I ordered the fresh mixed juice (carrots and orange).

The asada meat was a little on the dry side, yet somewhat greasy... does that even make sense? The carnitas and al pastor were decent. At least they weren't dry, but I was hungry so I downed it. The chicken quesadilla wasn't enjoyable at all... ended up boxing it up with a few bites. The only thing I really enjoyed was the mixed juice. It came room temperature... probably would've liked it ice, but it was good.

I probably wouldn't come here again unless I've exhausted all my options. This is a 24/7 place, so I guess that's the only real benefit it has."}
{"text":"Weak. If youre thinking about eating here change your mind and go to Los Tacos. 
Bomb. Bomb bomb bomb booooommmmmbbbb"}
{"text":"Ghetto mexican food. Located in the shadiest of spots, it remains open 24/7

food is better if you are inebriated but otherwise still decent.

Nothing special mexican taco stand, food is kinda bland nothing too spicy. Pork was kinda tough, beff was stringy, chicken was dry.

No pico? WTF!! 

Place looked like the person cleaning the dining room went to break right in the middle and left their stuff strung all over.

I would avoid this place-really kinda shitty but hell it's a long ways before anything else if you live in this neighborhood. poor you."}
{"text":"I only come here for 2 things: Carne Asada Nachos and Pastor tacos. They do both great. Service is good. They have a bunch of tvs, but only run a loop of a produced Pepe's commercial. Would be nice to have some regular tv/sports/news on. Love the no-frills feel of this place."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to pepe's I always spend $40+ this time I went there my all meat burrito was COLD! it was terrible! This happens more than once! Did I just pay for cold food?? Paid for guacamole and they forgot to add that in also in one of the burritos. The only thing that was hot was the fries but the meat cold!! So annoyed of their lazy service!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch. Food was ver good (taquitos very good!), place was clean, and service excellent. Would definitely do again."}
{"text":"Eager to visit this new location of a lifelong favorite restaurant, my partner and I came here for the usual. The interior is new, shiny, and just gorgeous. The digital menu was impressive, and seeing the veggies on ice for the fresh squeezed juices looked appetizing.
   He ordered an all meat lengua burrito and it was significantly smaller than the other locations we've been to. I ordered a chili relleno burrito with 2 chilis. 7.99. The cashier looked confused, and confirmed my order of the relleno burrito. A few minutes after we pay I noticed that we were charged 10.99 for a wet burrito combo meal, when I brought it to their attention, they were happy to make what we ordered. Getting that $3 difference back was a whole other story. 5 min later they hand us $2.06. I don't understand the confusion of such simple math, having been a cashier myself for years it just seemed like common sense that 10-7=3. We left with the food, and the relleno batter was raw inside the burrito. It was inedible, just awful. Don't go here, go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Finding a legit Mexican restaurant is challenging in this town, where's it's drowning in Mexican restaurants, including Chipotle.

Experiencing Pepe's Tacos is part of my list of finding some of the most authentic, bomb-ass Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Since moving here, my mind has been spinning around looking for THAT one Mexican place I'll frequent the most. Unfortunately, Pepe's isn't one of them. I understand this location is open 24/7 and it's not a guarantee that the food will be orgasmic unless I'm stoned but my past 2 visits here served up some bland, been-sitting-around-for-awhile-tasting meat. 

The place is clean and I like how the Jamaica and Horchata is all-you-can-drink in an easy dispenser since scooping it up can be such a pain in the ass. That's all I really like about the place."}
{"text":"Any establishment that has been closed not once, not twice but three times by the health department for demerits...uh I think not!  I used to eat here alot being as we would be across the street at the silver saddle and then shimmy over for some tacos, but they have been in the RJ so many times now they have a reserved column, think twice before going there!"}
{"text":"These tacos are very satisfying after a night of drinking, not gonna lie. If you're downtown having a good time and you want something to fill that void then Pepe's Tacos just might do it for you.

On recommendation from my friend who brought me here I ordered the carne asada tacos (2) and got an order of fries (ay! very gringo of me! so said my friend). Oh well, I can't help it if I'm white and I like fries!

Glad my friend suggested the carne asada tacos, they were bursting with meat and were very flavorful. Got a few different salsas and slathered these little suckers with salsa and lime. Oh man, they were tasty. You're gonna want to get more than one that's for sure. The fries were pretty dang good too. They put some kind of spice on them that gives them a real good kick. You're gonna like it if you like different tastes. I definitely suggest getting an order of fries with whatever you get here.

Ya, the location is a tad ghetto (doesn't bother me), but the place was clean and there was a lot of families in here when we showed up (kinda late actually). 

It's a good little place to get some bomb tacos in my opinion."}
{"text":"Very great tacos and the Carne asada fries are bomb!  I'm only giving 4 stars because the staff can be very rude and annoying. Obviously they have lots of people going day and night to eat there but when it comes to trying to take some salsa home with your tacos they give you a small little container  or small bags and tell you to take it with that. It's pretty ridiculous to fill those small containers with salsa Whomever is the boss there get better containers."}
{"text":"A great place for fast and authentic Mexican food. I always get the lengua burrito and horchata but they are known for their chili rellenos. The environment is clean and always bumping some mariachi music. I love coming here with large groups of people for my morning breakfast routine. Pepe's Tacos is the OG!"}
{"text":"I have been having a tragic time trying to find SoCal style Mexican food here in Vegas.  There are Roberto's, but not only was the Roberto's franchise not my first choice in San Diego (there are so many better taco shops), it's hit and miss here in Vegas -- each one is a little different and all are just slightly different than the ones in San Diego.

In my quest to find something like I'm used to, I read that Pepe's was much like SoCal -- and it sort of is.  It's not the same, but I think nothing will be the same as actually being there, so I just need to judge based on what I got.

I ordered the carnitas and I have to say, I was super unimpressed. The meat was bland and fatty and didn't have that salty crispness that carnitas have.  The tortillas were good, though, as were the rice and beans.

My boyfriend got the enchiladas and he's super picky about food, especially enchilada sauce, but he really loved them, so that bumps it up from 2 stars to 3 for me. Finally, enchiladas he likes.  He wasn't wild about the chorizo burrito he got another time, though.

The service was fine, albeit a little chilly in the \"never been before/what a gringo\" department, but adequate.

I will never understand why Nevada taco shops don't offer chips and salsa. People look at us like we're crazy whenever we ask for chips and salsa to go.  No place I've been here even HAS salsa, just hot sauce. I find it so strange.  They did offer chips, though.

I'd go back, but I'd likely just order tacos or a simple bean burrito. It didn't wow me.  But then, I'm just a gringo who grew up a stone's throw from the border, so what do I know? ;)"}
{"text":"MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR RECEIPT AFTER PAYING FOR PHANTOM CHARGES.  I went here with a couple of friends at about 5 AM (we're not drunks, we just all work night shifts), and ordered about $45 worth of food.  This apparently wasn't enough of our money for the woman behind the cashier, as she asked if we wanted drinks and we politely answered no, and that just water cups would be fine.  She even asked for clarification on if we wanted bottled water or water cups and we SPECIFICALLY stated that we just wanted water cups.  

The cashier then proceeds to charge us $6.87 extra for three medium drinks (we were unable to see an itemized menu from our end before paying).  When our total came out to $50.73 it raised a couple of eye brows, but the cashier held firm that that was our total for the food that we had ordered.  AFTER giving us our total, and after she saw that we were noticeably perplexed towards it being so expensive, she then proceeds to pull out three \"soda\" cups for us, which we just assumed was a gesture of good will for us spending over $50 at their establishment, especially since we had -specifically stated- and clarified that we did -not- want drinks, and that we only wanted water cups.  

We went and filled up our drinks that the generous cashier had just given us, then sat down.  That's when I checked my receipt and noticed the upcharge.  I politely approached the woman behind the cashier to inform her that we had been wrongfully overcharged, she then proceeds to tell us that since we had already filled the cups up that she was unable to refund us our money.  She admitted that it was her \"mistake\" by giving us three drinks that we hadn't ordered, AND she admitted that she COULD refund us our money, but apparently only had we not filled the cups up with anything.  

This is essentially petty theft what the cashier is pulling here, and it's a despicable and dastardly way to run a business.  I can't count how many people I've turned onto Pepe's or how many times I've been there; but the shady business of operations they've got going on at this location is extremely disappointing.  

Oh and if you want to look out for the shady cashier, I didn't catch her name unfortunately as she was not wearing a name tag, but she was a lighter skinned but Hispanic woman with dark hair.  She looked to be in her mid 30's, with a little extra to love but not obese by any means; and probably about 5'7\" in height. Shame on you Pepe's.  Was $6.87 really worth losing three loyal customers?"}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing. I ordered a late night dinner on a delivery service for my boyfriend and I. When the food arrived, it was freezing. I had to microwave my entree for it to even be edible. My food itself was a disappointment. 3 carne asada tacos plate, but there was so much sour cream and lettuce, that I spent a good deal of time trying to clean it up. The \"chips\" were coated in sour cream, soggy, and useless. The only good part of my meal was my drink, but it's hard to screw up aguas frescas. 

Tldr; go somewhere else and don't waste your money or time. I'll be ordering my late night cravings from a place that doesn't serve cold beans, or dump sour cream on them."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Just the worst in town really. Had to jump crazy with one of the cashiers behind counter. I ordered 5 carne asada tacos and it was totally wrong. 3 were the other 2 idk. Aint really nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Best place to get authentic mexican tacos/food at 4am after the club lol(:  open 24hr."}
{"text":"Wayyyyy too expensive. Got charged for water cups as regular sodas. They charge card fee, every plate is $9.99, an individual street taco is $2.25. They still hide napkins but charge like a real sit in restaurant.  Dinner for 2 cost $9.99 x2, $2.15 x2, so after taxes and card fee you're looking at about $27....Save your money and go to Roberto's."}
{"text":"I'd like to update my previous review: 

I was just at Pepe's the other day (late June 2011) with some work people. They have increased their prices on the entire menu. They have a little paper notifying you of that near the cashier that says it is due to the economic climate that we're in. 

Before, a big reason for their appeal was their value. It was a great deal, specially when compared to Los Tacos on Sahara or Charleston. That is still the case now, but less so. 

In regards to their food? It's still pretty good. It's not going to wow you, but you should be pretty full off a super burrito with carne asada (my fav). Now that the prices are slightly higher (taco special was 6.50 and now it's 7.19, I think) I kinda wanna expect more, but it's still the same quality that it was before."}
{"text":"First time, last time. I could tolerate the obnoxious staff if the food was good, but it wasn't. The foods not terrible, it's average. I'll just go to Roberto's where the food is better and the people actually seem to care about the client."}
{"text":"Normally when I go here I only get a few things one being the asada fries. These things are awesome. Possibly the best ones I have had here. Every time I have ever been there it has been packed even at like 1 am so the rest of the food can't be that bad. 

The restaurant it's self is not in the best condition. It's in an older building. So don't expect to much from the decor. Service is nothing exceptional either. But in the taste category I cant get enough."}
{"text":"This is the second location I've eaten at and I've had way better. My office ordered from here for one of our work lunches. I ordered the cheese enchilada combo meal, and there was hardly any cheese! The enchiladas themselves were small and the beans were strange tasting. The rice was actually pretty good, I may or may not order from here again. If I do it'll be a very specific/custom order."}
{"text":"ordered a combo burrito, very little chicken, a lot of beans, also come with 8 pieces of chip, for 8 dollar, not worth it at all, i rather go Roberto on Fort apache, much better at anything"}
{"text":"Amazing cabeza tacos!

Carne asada tacos on the salty side, but not too bad.

Salsa is mediocre, should have been more thought about

Overall, the best in town, [so far]"}
{"text":"$10 for Carne Asada Nachos. Pretty costly for a fast food type of place and I ONLY wanted Cheese and Meat on it. As if that wasn't easy enough, they Still put sour cream and guacamole on top, which meant more than half of the nachos / meat went untouched / were scraped off. Oh wait $9.50 because they charge 50 cents per card transaction. -.-\""}
{"text":"This place is disgusting the steak taste's like beef like nasty old beef that's been in the freezer for 5 years! Their health grade was not visible anywhere. No hot water in the restroom. Horrible nasty service to top it off."}
{"text":"The food is ok , it's generic Mexican food I give it a b+
I come to this place every once in a while I like their carne asada fries.
What is shitty about this place seems to be the employees & policy's , today I couldn't buy a side of avacado or add it to any of my food .... what the actual fuck, that's the stupidest shit.
Another thing that is really annoying when you call in to order the lady taking your phone is having 4 other conversations. They take your order down but won't make it until you get there and pay for it so I don't understand why they even take it over the phone .
The soda machine is broken ......again
The food is not very special .  I can get carne asada fries anywhere And I will not come back after another bad experience"}
{"text":"I'll have to eat here again, I wasn't really impressed but I didn't get my usual \"Taco Shop\" fare. The restaurant was really clean and the staff was very polite. The prices were pretty reasonable in comparison to Roberto's. I personally like Roberto's better but I'll try Pepe's again before I make a for sure judgement."}
{"text":"Smells terrible inside, we should have turned around and walked right out. Food was not good at all. My husband and I had some type of food poisoning from there. Will never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Pepe's is like one of those spots you want to stop by for a late night bite to hit that late night craving.  The carne asada plate was solid, definitely got a hearty portion of meat in addition to the fixings, beans, and rice.  

As for service, I didn't have any issues with the staff.  The cashier was friendly and the food was ready in a very reasonable time with a few customers ahead of me with orders.  All in all, it hit the spot for that late night craving and would come back again."}
{"text":"This location has the worse customer service ever.   We order 55 dollars worth of food and when  it was come to leave I asked to have a take out box and a stupid want to be cook told Me he could not give me one.  How the heck are you suppose to take 3 tacos home, if you Oder the food for eating in.  He put an argument with me and did not give me a container.   I can tell you this idiot just lost a good customer and screw their tip, because the 10 dollars I was going to leave them am handing it to the homeless outside.

Food is stupid expensive and not all that with the type of service they definably won't see me again ..."}
{"text":"Pepe's is not all that and a bag of chips. This is another place that's not far from where I work and it had some recommendations from people that I needed to try it. I'm just not impressed. 

Parking, especially at lunch sucks. If you end up parking behind the place over to the West it stinks, a combo smell of grease and sewer that will blast you the second you open your car door. Once you step inside to what looks like an ancient IHOP from the outside you'll find a busy kitchen, ample seating, serve yourself drink fountains, and 2 places to stand for the staff to take your order. And that's where things go South. I've had my order messed up 2 out of 3 times here due to it being lost in translation. The lunch special with 3 chicken tacos somehow ended up as beef tacos, not the lunch special, and at a higher cost. 

As you wait for your order you can check out the duo-salsa bar. 2 types of salsa and the typical pickled Jalapenos and stuff is all you get, and the tomatillo light salsa is the only one I like. It's great for pouring all over the greasy tacos that you'll get. Crunchy yes, but dang, sometimes they just don't taste good at all. 

I've been here a couple of times for lunch now but don't plan to keep them in my lunch rotation. Lindo Michaocan is not far away drive time wise, and they kick Pepe's to the curb in so many ways. If you happen to be driving down Fremont and are just dying for Mexican food this place won't kill you, but it ain't all that either. 

2 Stars. Sorry, that's the best I can give it."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for good food like Pepe's. Quick service and open 24 hours... so it really hits the spot whenever you're craving mexican at any time. I had the carne asada fries, didn't think I was gonna like it that much, turns out it was pretty damn good and its the only thing I will order."}
{"text":"I like the food here. I went here while on my way to visit family and the tacos I had were very good, the service was fast and customer service has always been friendly. They should pay more attention to their customer self service bar but besides that it was pretty clean."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with their lingua soft tacos. When I came here, I wanted to try something new so I tried the goat and lingua. Both are equally amazing. $2.50 per taco may sound steep but they're so good! The unlimited horchata and hibiscus is another favorite of mine. I feel like this place is true authentic Mexican food. I can't eat here all the time though, considering it destroys your digestive system haha ;) (not blaming the restaurant, it's just the characteristic of the food itself)."}
{"text":"How can two restaurants have such  different portion sizes? I live in Mountain's Edge, the food at the N. Decatur is so good that I was happy to see a location was opened a bit closer to me on Rainbow, so I decided to check it out thinking everything would be the same. Boy was I wrong. The meat wasn't as seasoned and the size of the burrito (that I always get) was on the anorexic side. I tasted mostly flour tortilla... I was very disappointed and have not been back since. Yes the N. Decatur location is in an unpleasant neighborhood, and if you go late at night there may be a fight that breaks out amongst the intoxicated customers waiting on their food,...but SO WHAT!! the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"After my poor experience at the Rainbow location, it made me appreciate the N. Decatur location that much more. Yes I have complaints about the Decatur location, but it has nothing to do with the actual restaurant. The neighborhood is scary and the customers that come out after dark are even scarier. I've been there at 2am when a fight broke out between intoxicated customers that were waiting on their food. Not a pleasant environment at all. But hey, comes with the territory. The food however is amazing. I always order the carne asada burrito and cheese enchilada. I'm not sure what makes that meat so seasoned but I've never had a bad batch. The enchilada sauce is wonderful, just perfect...I always wanted a location closer to where I live, but now I know that only N. Decatur knows how to get it right. I will continue to travel to the other side of the world (during the daytime) to get the best Mexican food in Vegas. This is a true hole in the wall spot that doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is a busy location. The set up of the counter and register plus the cart or table for the salsa bar is one of the worst choices I've seen. First the line to order forms just in front of the salsa bar and a group of booth tables. So those trying to order crash, collide, and have to navigate around each other. It bottlenecks. And if that is section is where you happen to sit to eat, then you are at Butt's level, meaning your view is of everyone else's¬†derri√®re. Next another reviewer wrote that while she was eating an employee was cleaning with fabuloso cleaner and it put her off her food. Well when we were there, during what seemed like a dinner rush, that after it died down just a tad, and yet they were still busy, that mopping the floor was going to happen. I about lost my dinner from the smell of the cleaner. I've worked food service and, well, there are reasons why you shouldn't clean around the customers. Now if all of this doesn't put you off and you want to try, as the sign says, the best tacos, well... Only if you must. These are not the best tacos. I love tacos, have worked my way through the taco places in town and let me ask you - what self respecting Mexican restaurant uses caned cheese on their Nacho's?... If I wanted that I would go to taco bell, at least TB nacho cheese tastes like nacho cheese instead of bland watery cheese like goo.  The chicken tasted like they don't remove the skin before cooking. The flavor was OK, just the skin put me off. The carne asada was edible, slightly better than bland, the street tacos were a little pricey. And the only truly yummy the drink bar is self serve and has pineapple soda... I can get more food for the money that tastes better, at, at least 10 other places including taco bell, and in my opinion taco bell used to be pretty good 20+ years ago but has considerable gotten gross. So in comparison, I'd rather go to taco bell than Pepe's... But you have to at least try it for yourself, because I don't get how this place is so busy all the time. It can not be just the pineapple soda. I wish Pepe's tacos well. I do not like giving bad reviews. I just can't recommend this location, maybe others are better, but I would be afraid to try."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would! The food was absolutely awful. Spent $20 on food and threw $18 of it away. The Dr Pepper was by far the best thing. Carnitas Torta tasted like nothing but stale bread, carne asada burrito looked and tasted like dog food (it was so dry even the beans were crusted), the lengua taco was not edible, and the chips tasted like oil. Do not go here!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a super burrito with carne asada and chips and guacamole. I paid almost $15 for the meal which seemed very high after seeing what I got. The chips weren't anything to write home about and the guacamole was in a small cup. It was no where near worth paying the $5.25 for the side order. As for the burrito. I thought it tasted ok, that is until I discovered a HAIR in the burrito. It was actually wrapped up in within the burrito itself so I knew it could not be mine. That ruined the meal for me and I couldn't finish either the burrito or chips and guacamole. 

Being new to Las Vegas, my first experience with Mexican food was a complete disaster. I will NOT be returning to pepe's and if you would like to finish your meal without regrets like this I would suggest you go somewhere else. Taco is reasonable and you at least expect to eat crap there."}
{"text":"I love Pepe's!!  I come here every time I visit my friends in Vegas.  No Vegas trip is complete without a meal at Pepe's.

Chicken hard tacos: Yummy yummy!  And not too greasy like some hard tacos can be.  My personal fave.  I crave them when I'm back in LA!
Asada super burrito: The boys love 'em!  Just one is enough to put you into a happy food coma.
Prices: Good!  I fed myself and 3 full-grown men all for $20, drinks included.  And trust me, those boys eat a lot!

We were having a taco-crazy weekend, and Pepe's was delicious even though this was the third time we sat down for tacos in less than 24 hours.  Yeah, we take our tacos seriously.  I've been telling my California buddies about this place for years -- Best place to wind down and have a cheap meal before driving back to CA."}
{"text":"The owner of pepe establishment is a racist piece of shit! Yes even tho he himself is a minority he still saw fit to call a young man a N**** ( the N word) all he was trying to do is his job."}
{"text":"I LOVE MEXICANS.... I MEAN MEXICAN FOOD!

Pepe's compared to Roberto's. 

Pepe's knocks this one out of the ball park. The reason being the quality of food is way better. I want it to be known that the staff here is very friendly, maybe a little to friendly I had a guy in the back winking at me.
Also the first time I was here one of the employees actually asked me for my number, at that time (2010) I was single and to this day I still talk to him as a good friend.

Overall you can order anything with the carne asada and it will be great. The carne asada is finely chopped and has very minimal fat. They season their meat very well, not to salty nor to bland. The add a side of beans and tortilla chips.

The only thing I would do different is keep the salsa station clean."}
{"text":"The location of this restaurant is somewhat questionable, but if you can get past that and managed to find a parking spot in this 15 cars parking lot and you have been somewhat intoxicated, then maybe you'll find Pepes Tacos to be A-OK. 

Nothing really jumps out at you at Pepe's, which may actually be a good thing.  Don't expect the food to be spectacular, but neither is the food below average.  The lengua tacos are not overcooked but a bit bland. 

I would actually recommend the al pastor.  But my favorite about Pepes is that your order comes with chips and beans.  The beans are half smashed and half whole, and they taste delicious.  Pepes' chips are also surprisingly fresh.  

I would come back for the chips and beans, but who comes back for that? ..."}
{"text":"My husband love the tacos ... but I go menudo \"to go\" of course I took it home. Turns out it have a little meat and like 1/4 cup of corn. I feel like I got cheated... I always recommend this place to everyone but now I won't."}

{"text":"I have eaten mexican food my whole life. I grew up and lived in los angeles my whole life. And i have to tell you I have NEVER not eaten what i was served. I have always wondered what a dead mule's anus tasted like,well i found out after taking just ONE bite from my carne asada quesadilla. It tasted HORRIBLE! I mean really who eats this garbage? This is the poorest quality mexican food i have ever tasted..it took 30 minutes for me to get rid of that rancid taste in my mouth...that was a waste money and quite possibly a threat to my health. I will also say i noticed the carving station where they chop up the meat is not sanitary,they are constantly pulling out different meats and commingling the bacteria and juices from all,not to mention the flavors from meats i may not prefer the taste of,and using the same knife to cut it...this place should be inspected by the health department asap."}
{"text":"Very good street tacos !! Good place - need to clean the booths but hell its Vegas !!! Hahaha"}
{"text":"I had a sort of late dinner here with some family and their asada fries are delicious. I love the fact that they use greatly cooked asada, creamy sour cream and avacado, crispy fries and a gooey nacho cheese that tops it off so well. This masterpiece dish makes me want to come back to get more of their well made food. Definitely a spot to get Mexican food that will save you money and still give your money's worth."}

She was rude, food was ehh. Not soo good this time"}
{"text":"Great Service Great Food.

  I came @ 4:30 in the AM. I called in my order and the lady literally said ok so how long will it take for you to get here (in a sweet voice) I said I don't know about 10-15 min I guess so she said \"Ok its 4:16 I will have the cook put it on @ 4:28 because no one wants a cold quesadilla\" lol. 

  She and the cook where on it man. She wanted to do anything and everything to make me happy. Which honestly doesn't take much lol. But for whatever reason you could tell no matter whom called or came in she was going to be professional, polite, smile, jump threw hoops, show the food, give napkins, hook you up with baggies for the side bar etc. On it.

 Lady was a legit sweet heart man. Food was bomb and big portions. Also she spoke Spanish and english very well and articulate. Unlike me lol. Place was super clean and chief had just washed the grill."}

{"text":"This lady. Adela is racist and won't except money from black people.  I sat and watched her take money from several different people to include 100.00 from a young individual for his food but wouldn't except my 20.00 accusing me of having fake currency. This is totally wrong and I'm very offended that Adela the cashier at Pepe did this to me and my friends on our visit to Las Vegas and I will NEVER EVER go back to that establishment again. I'll be sending this very same message to the better business bureau to investigate or look into this matter"}
{"text":"When I came to Pepe's I was undoubtedly hangry!  I just got off of a plane from Colorado and was headed home.  I've seen Pepe's on the way home many times but this was my first time here.  The restaurant is an order at the counter and sit down kind of place.  It was early in the morning but they were serving everything which was already a plus!  I ordered 2 tacos, one carne asada and one el pastor.  The meal also came with complimentary chips and re-fried beans to dip it in. These are more street type tacos so don't expect a large tortilla with all the fixins.  Each taco came with meat, onions, and cilantro.  The carne asada was juicy and had a great steak taste to it.  The el pastor was seasoned to perfection but like some have said it was a little bit dry.  I haven't tried much from here yet so I'm going to give Pepe's 3 stars for taste, price, and aesthetics of the location.  I'll have to come again and try something different."}

If you're not in the mood for tacos, their menu offers great and delicious alternatives. Burgers, Carne Asada Fries, Ect. If you are a tourist like me and are hungry in Vegas at 2am, do not fear! This place is open 24 hours a day. Recommend it to everyone who is in town visiting Vegas"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and decent price. Way better than Taco Bell and chain places like that. The inside could be a little nicer setup. Would like to see a few more soft taco combos for the evening time."}

Always busy in this place..."}

{"text":"We were very excited about this place opening up...man did they disappoint us!!!  The lady at the register didn't speak very good English and had a hard time taking our order...we should've ran then.  We ordered 3 rolled tacos (were burnt, not edible), cheese quesadilla, and carne asada fries (they use nacho cheese YUCK not shredded cheese).  $28.00 later.  Should've went to Roberto's instead...better food and half the price."}
{"text":"Carne Asada sopes not bad, Al Pastor taco was pretty good.  Good cheese and flavor in the Chile Relleno.  Highlight:  Chicharrones taco!!!  It was my first time trying it, and it was AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Don't bother anymore .. Last couple of years they have gone from good to okay to just plain bad. Ordered a taco with everything and two gorditas to go..

We waited over 30mins.. Because they made the wrong gorditas we wanted chicharon and carnitas.. They made two alpastor.. No sorry no nothing . 

On the way home, the taco was 'naked' no salsa no onion no cilantro .. The gorditas .. Not fresh and not gorditas .. Mostly beans and lettuce and lard no carnitas no chicharon .. Hard and dry. 

So damn disappointed"}
{"text":"Dry carne asada and stale chips...no bueno
With la bonita meat market in the same shopping center you would belive this restaurant would at least try to keep up...I rather go there for lunch...sorry vatos just being honest..."}
{"text":"Reminds me of being in El Monte, Ca....hole in the wall kind of place but I kinda have a thing for those unfussy ones. Some people don't and thought it kinda weird when I said I've been here like I went into a gang lair. Most of those night taco stands I love back home are kinda shady looking at first but doesn't bother me. Hell, I've dined at taco shops where gangsters have meetings and rib joints with real pimps sharing my table and mexicans having a blood feud running into each other and stabbing each other before their tacos are called and  to me that just adds to the flavor. This has an odd old area- but it has none of those and just normal people dining so it's not that bad to me. Maybe I'm desensitized to \"ghetto\" cuz is a whole different level in LA and when I lived in San Diego I went across the border for tacos often but old odd area doesnt just add to a ghetto to me.

Lengua was pretty good times I went. I have trouble finding the exotic meat toppings at most joints. Adobada was good. Carnitas were good. I mostly come for lengua late night. A few times the consistency was just okay, kinda ordered on an off day but what taco place doesnt have that? Overall though more on than a off day and been here many times as it was the closest lae night to our old house.

It's decent for my late night lengua. I am still in search for the best taco shop, but I have a feeling it's probably way across town with my luck."}
{"text":"Passed by here so many times. Stopped in a couple days ago. Excellent tacos stuffed full. The jamaica aqua fresca is awesome. Very clean restaurant. Yeriley is an awesome employee. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok so the location maybe a little shady and you may think this place has an infestation of roaches.. THINK AGAIN!  You know what they say never judge a book by it's cover... This place has amazing tacos and chicken quesedillas! I ordered the chicken quesidillas and it was amazing! really delicioous.. I also had a taste of the mira beef tacos and really good.. For drinks i had the Horchata of course.. Who wouldnt order that when in a mexican restaurant?! This place is quick and down to eart whole in the wall.. I give this a thumbs up! Si Senor for PePe's tacos!"}
{"text":"AAAAAMAZING! $7.95 for the lunch (M-F) 3 taco special which includes a small drink. I had the carne asada tacos (with the double small corn tortillas). Now, for you folks who don't like spicy, ask for them WITHOUT salsa. Otherwise, its on there and you are in for a spicy surprise that will clean your sinuses from here till the end of flu season. 

This place is clean. Has a soda dispenser and a condiment bar for its customers. The bathrooms are clean and been neat every time we visit. They are on it when it comes to cleanliness. 

Baby changing table: No
Kids?: Kid Friendly
Bathrooms: Womens (Clean) 
Best part of this place: Unlimited Jalapenos and salsa baby!
Worst: Nothing."}
{"text":"Chillin' with a bunch of friends and we were all hungry as heck.  Undecided the group was so we just threw out Pepe's Tacos in our option of the night.  But the girls were complaining that it was ghetto and I'm like ya'll ghetto as hell too and they agreed, so we went.

Not the best mexican restaurant I've been to.  Everything was pretty average and though the carne asada fries weren't part of the menu, they still made it for me.  I prefer Roberto's Tacos carne asada fries over Pepe's and the burritos as well.  Nothing really special about this place.

Outside smells like effing sewage and Pepe's actually have their own song bumpin outside.  It goes something like this, \"aaay aay aaaaay Pepe's taco aaay aaay aaay\", with their traditional trumpet blastin' in the background.  

.....Sh*t the burrito is starting to kick in and I'm at the Grind Coffee writing this. I hate taking a sh*t in public restrooms."}
{"text":"Food is always prices could be better and still worth it. Sometimes need to double check that your order is correct especially when ordering to go. Carne Asada is all full of flavor."}
{"text":"Assad fries are now $9.79.
Now, there wouldn't be a problem coming here and paying that if the quality matched the price. Last time I was here it cost less and the quality was still great. Today how ever was another story. The meat had extra fat and easily identify it as lower quality cuts. If the price didn't go up of they quality change I would mind paying the 8.75 they were charging a few weeks ago. 
I would not be coming here again. A little longer drive for quality food in which you get what you pay for.
Time to look for a new spot"}
{"text":"Sad that there is such bad customer service when the economy is so bad. I hope management knows they're paying employees to play with cell phones and talk on the restaurant phones while ignoring customers. What a shame"}

{"text":"Pepe's is what I would call, \"Just okay.\" I went here because it was close to where I was and I wanted to eat. Taco meat was so-so, and the al pastor was very fatty. After eating the tacos I had that feeling of regret that sometimes washes over, like gas station sushi."}
{"text":"They have the worst customer service they took forever to give me my food everyone after me got there food before me then my order was messed up and of course they didn't remember anything I ordered when I called up there HORRIBLE GET IT TOGETHER"}
{"text":"I am very happy they are open 24-hours and happen to fall directly on my route to and from the airport, so regardless the time, if I am in a mad dash to or a hunger-crazed return from the airport, I can pop in and grab a quick, cheap snack. The quality of the snack, however, is mediocre. The tacos aren't huge, but they also aren't expensive. However, they are constructed with one corn tortilla, which falls victim to dreaded soggy taco whereby the contents of the taco escape onto your plate. Spoon is required. The flavor of the taco is ok, but not amazing, and unfortunately, the salsa bar was a total wreck when we visited. I wasn't inspired to douse up the taco. The spot is big, so there is plenty of room for sitting, and the service was kind and quick. For what Pepe's is, it is ok, but if I am not in a hurry or have other options that are open, it wouldn't be my first stop."}
{"text":"Zero stars overpriced miniature tacos.i spent 5 dollars on 2 tacos I finished them in less than 30 seconds and I'm not exaggerating they are that small!"}
{"text":"This place is a serious scam.What they call a taco you can eat in one bite .They must run like a 1% food cost.Highway robbery at its finest. At $2.25 a taco you would have to eat at least ten to get full.Funny the guy before me ordered 13 tacos and I figured he was feeding his family he must just really like those tacos lmao. Only reason I am giving one star is because the cashier lady was real  nice when I complained . She offered me some free beans but I wasn't about to take them the way the cook was glaring at me . You definitely get the we hate whitey vibe in this filthy restaurant. I would wager good money if you see any five star ratings it's probably the owners friend or family. Also FYI the majority of the taco is just onions and cilantro which they have sitting out for free anyway. No Bueno !!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are hot and miss depending on the day. Honestly I would probably eat here more often if the salsa wasn't so bad. Why is it so hard to get salsa that's actually hot and not that lame chipotle or weak green sauce? You would be better off to just throw some Tapatio on the table"}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere are awful! The only thing that has us coming back is the faxt that the Robertos next to them closed and its closest taco shop thats open late in my area. The cashiers are very rude and stand offish , i almost feel bad for bothering them . It is extremely cold in there . The food size and quality is inconstant, even in the same order. It takes a good 15-20 minutes to receive your food."}
{"text":"Not sure if I got there on a good day (early Sunday) or what, but I LOVED this place. Also consider that I have moved to the East Coast recently and I miss Mexican food. BFF and I ordered a super burrito wet. Not cheap for such a dive. We paid $12 for this massive pillow of heaven. It was served with chips (which were fresh). The salsa bar had pickeled peppers/carrots, sliced radishes, red salsa, salsa verde and diced onion/cilantro. Not fancy but good enough. This burrito was huge, filled with carnitas, sour cream, shredded lettuce and beans, I did not see rice in it (which I don't like anyway). It was covered with a gravy style enchilada sauce, which I also like. And plenty of melted cheese. This bomb was delicious. I grossed myself out and ate the whole thing.   This place is not fancy and its in a sketchy location that I wouldn't venture to by myself or at night, but I live dangerously in search of good food like this during the day!"}
{"text":"Good tacos if you EVER happen to be on this side of town in Vegas... we were in town to watch SFPD play in a community football league with some other departments of various cities. The park they played at was directly across the street from Pepe's Tacos and we found ourselves here two days in a row after the games to fill up on some awesome tacos. It's a typical taqueria joint with offerings of asada, pollo, carnitas, lengua, etc. Prices ranged from $1.25 a taco to $4 for a burrito. I don't know about the other taquerias in town, but this one was as authentic tasting as I've had in LA and the Mission District in SF. Good stuff!!!"}
{"text":"This place is whack! Over priced and the Quality of food is weak my wife each got a carnie Asiata burrito and it was not up to par with Robert's taco shop no cheese and more rice then meat wtf, You guys need to step it up."}
{"text":"You must have paid these people to write such a bs review. Don't order from this place. Service was meh and the food is just as bad."}
{"text":"I think food was pricey compared to similar taco shops. Taste was okay. Nothing special indeed. Clean restrooms & restaurant area. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Sister and I were hungry at 10 PM on a Sunday night and were looking for some Mexican delight. Pepe's Tacos had recently opened up near our house and we decided to get down.

I ordered three tacos: carne asada, lengua, and al pastor. The lengua and the carne asada were decent. Not horrible, but not stand out. The star of my taco trio was the al pastor. The marinated pork, cilantro, onion, a squeeze of lime, a touch of the hot sauce. AMAZING! Definitely a must try. 

My sister got the Machacha Plate which came with beans, rice, and warm tortillas. The machacha itself was pretty bland, nothing really lively or exciting about it. Didn't really pack much of a punch. The rice and beans were okay as well.

Pepe's is open 24 hours and has a wide variety of offerings that are all cooked to order. They have a traditional taco salsa bar, with the red hot spicy sauce of death (which I love) and a green, mild salsa. The carrot, onion, jalapeno mix. Radishes. 

This location was clean, brightly lit. The staff was friendly. Pepe's is a decent taco shop. A step up from Roberto's, but not a home run."}
{"text":"New and hot is not at all what this place is. The food was terrible and so was the service. I ordered 3 soft tacos and the hubs ordered a burrito. First you could tell they started with more meat with the first taco and got progressively less. I also asked for green sauce on top, didn't get any, I originally asked for pico and she didn't say not but tried to steer me way. The husbands burrito was bland and had very little meat in it. Considering they just opened and are by a movie theater they would step their game up but no they fell flat on their faces. It's over priced and under whelming."}
{"text":"I always only order menudo for myself and a lengua plate for the wife.  We both like these dishes very much and have been customers for since 2005.  My sons like the Super Burrito and order it every time.  We have not branched out much from those dishes so I can't review how the other plates are.  We've been coming here for years and have enjoyed this restaurant every time.  They have really good freshly squeezed fruit juices also--don't pass these up."}
{"text":"Great lunch special! 3 tacos, chips and beans, and a drink for $8.00. So yummy!! Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This was my second time vising this restaurant, and I wanted the second time to be better than the first.

Upon walking in, there is no customer service. In fact, we were kind of ignored and treated like we annoyed them. I even had to go and ask what numbers we were because they weren't given to us.

I spent $30 on two plates of food (taquito Plate and soft taco plate) and two drinks for my son and I and my girlfriend spent $15 on carne asada fries and a fish taco. 

The food is mehhhh! There is no flavor and everything is lacking salt. The taquitos were burnt and dried out. My son didn't even eat the three of them on the plate and he loves taquitos. The guac. had no salt, lacking lime juice or something. My tacos were tasteless, I added lime juice, hot sauce and whatever else I had on my plate just to try and get some flavor out of it. I gave up on the tacos, threw one away. I tried the rice and beans and man, those were better than the tacos but still lacked flavor. 

My girlfriend said the nacho cheese was probably the best thing about her fries as the carne was lacking flavor as well. The fish taco she said was awful. The sauce was sour and she only took two bites of it.

Needless to say, we were not happy with our $50 meal. We both went home and actually vomit from the way everything made us feel afterwards. Customer Service was definitely lacking and made us feel unwelcome. I wont be back."}
{"text":"I wish I'd read the Yelp reviews prior to stopping in to Pepe's. The super burrito was anything but \"super\". The carne asada was more like tiny minced meat and the size of the burrito should've been listed as puny, especially for the price.

The wife's breakfast burrito was no better and she could barely eat it. Never, never, never again."}
{"text":"Had a carne asada burrito, and it was one of the worse burritos I've ever had. Just plain tasting and the meat was dry and full of Grisel, won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food sucks. The prices are way over priced. They take forever to make your food. The cashier is rude and the restaurant wasn't very clean, tables were dirty, the salsa bar containers were almost empty. All this at 1230 in the afternoon on Saturday. There we like 4 customers in the restaurant. I won't try this place again. Roberto's kinda sucks, but it was better than this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the Carne Asada fries.... What a huge mistake! $9 for fries with nasty cheap nacho cheese, carne Asada just thrown on with a small scoop of sour cream and guacamole.... What a waste of $9!!!! Been to way better places that are cheaper and taste way better! So disappointing."}
{"text":"Really, what is a Mexican Restrurent with no Chili Relleno's? An over grown Taco Bell. Very disappointed that this location doesn't have any Chili Rellenos today. I know Robertos has Chii Rellenos all the time."}
{"text":"I'm the only person in the place,standing at the register and the waitress asks, \"Do you want something?\" I responded, \"Yes!\" She rolls her eyes at me and then takes my order. She asks if I knew that the extra items cost more...smh Poor customer service!"}
{"text":"It was late, I was starving and this is the closest taco shop to my house so I decided to give it a go.  The thing that got me most excited prearrival was that they offered al pastor 24/7.  Not much can beat great al pastor and I have yet to find anything that tops my beloved (and closed down) Tacos Los Parados al pastor, so I had high hopes.  

Those hopes dashed away as soon as I was at the counter and saw the pastor spinning on the spit.  It was as if it had been on there for a couple of days.  I then realized how difficult it must be to maintain quality pastor around the clock.  This is why there aren't any 24 hour shawarma joints.  Yet I was in denial and ordered 2 pastor tacos and 2 chicken tacos for $1.79 a piece to go.  

10 minutes later, all 4 tacos were crammed into a foil package the size of a PB&J sandwich.  I was surprised at how small it all was that I asked the cashier \"Is this everything?\".  I get home and realized that I had just ordered the smallest tacos in the world.  

I read an article a while back that the current (maybe not by the time you read this) New York Jets coach, Rex Ryan, would eat 12 tacos for dinner before he had gastric bypass.  He certainly wasn't eating these babies.  The chicken was fine and as I had expected, the pastor was dry.  Perhaps I need to go during peak hours when it's fresh?

Roberto's is definitely their main competitor and in the cheap and ghetto Vegas taco game, Roberto wins."}

Mmkayyy..I put it in the microwave to melt the cheese and warm up the meat. I then realized..there's NO BEANS. I called and the rep said \"You can bring them back and we'll just put beans on them\". Uhh no. If I'm going to use MY GAS to go back I will get FRESH FOOD. After getting my food the SECOND time I get home and YET AGAIN the food is COLD. Not even warm..COLD. Soooooo...yea..No thanks."}

I will maybe come back or maybe not  
The tacos was super burned The meet very hard !!! I don't even know why they can serve this crap"}
{"text":"First time here... going to make this short.... staff is NOT friendly!!! ....
*CARNE ASADA SUPER NACHOS: $9.99 and a waste (cheese was watered down and the guacamole was disgusting - store bought?)
*CARNITAS TACOS: $2.25 each also a waste :/ 
However I will say that the CARNE ASADA COMBINATION BURRITO was delicious which is why I gave them 3 stars... if it weren't for the burrito they would have gotten 1 star (0 if possible)... so if you want a good carne Asada burrito this is the place to go but if you're looking for nachos etc it's not the best place!"}
{"text":"Okay lets get the facts out of the way;
1. The place is a dump.
2. It is a quik service place.
3. Prices are very reasonable.

If you are in the mood for fast mexican food that tastes muy bueno - this is the place!  Cheap eats and authentic taqueria type food.  

I had the carnitas plate - carnitas, beans, rice, and chips. With a drink it is about $10.  The plate was enough for 2 people easily (I think the girl behind the counter liked me so she may have given me extra...not sure though).  

A friend had the carne asada - I sampled it and it was right on.

All of the food was simple with lotsa flavor.  I am guessing the beans had real lard, too.  Hey every once in awhile is good!

Viva Pepes Tacos!"}
{"text":"Always great service and good food! The carne asada is amazing! Even when they are busy you get your food fast. I like the portions that they give and they always honor my discounts or promotions."}

{"text":"--- Review from www.JerseyGirlinVegas.com ---

Yesterday I went to find my \"local\" post office to pick up a package during my lunch break. In doing so I discovered a great little Mexican joint called Pepe's on Decanter. 

They have great big signs that caught my eye. I figured, I'm hungry, tacos sound good, let's try it out! When I opened the door I read they were voted the best in Las Vegas 2015 so I was getting pretty optimistic on this find. I ordered the 2 hard shell pulled beef taco and soda lunch special for $5.10. I also picked up some chips and salsa since their salsa bar looked so yummy (see below). My order was to go since I was short on time. 

When I arrived back to work I broke into the tacos almost immediately. The one shell was cracked but the flavor was exceptional so it was the least of my concerns. I trickled some of the smokey, spicy, homemade salsa I had for my chips on the tacos. It made my taste buds do the happy dance! They were SO good! If anyone is looking for some quick, authentic Mexican cuisine, stop by Pepe's. They have 4 locations around town.

And they are OPEN 24 HOURS!"}
{"text":"This place was expensive! The tacos are small and over $2. If you want to add a side of rice, it's $2.25. Also, 50 cents per card transaction. Roberto's on Fort Apache and Tropicana, way better deal and food!"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would!!!! You worker tonight is a straight Bi*ch ! She completely ignored me when I asked her something and your nice kitchen worker helped me out I hate rude people and she was definitely one ! I will NEVER come here again and no one else that I know because I will tell everyone about this experience because it was horrible ! She should be fired and should definitely not be working with costumers ! Also the to top it off the food was totally disgusting! Overall the worst place I have ever been to!"}
{"text":"Normally I love this place, and I recomend it to everyone, but my recent visit was beyond disappointing.  Not sure if the owner has chosen to go for less quallity meat, but I'm not sure I would have fed my two burritos and five tacos to a stray dog that was about to die of starvation.  That was one of the worst meals that I have had in a long time.  I'm a native and I took some other locals there for the first time, and I was embarrassed to have taken them there after we sort of ate the crap that was bundled up in a tortilla. 

I had the carnitas, and my friends has the carne asada.  Both were loaded with unedible cartiledge, and my carnitas had bone fragments in it.  The rice was nearly raw throughout both burritos which was mixed in with some other over cooked rice.  This probably means that they are mixing old product in with new product.  NO BUENO!  Maybe the Clark County Health Department needs to do an inspection of the facilities to ensure proper use of cooked food.  Its obvious that there is a lack of training on behalf of the owner/management if they are even around to oversee at all.  

Dear Pepe's,
GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food- best I've had in vegas. Very relaxed atmosphere so it's a great place to grab a quick bite. Areas a little rough but I think it adds to the charm making this a place a bit of a gem."}
{"text":"Good fast Mexican for breakfast or dinner.  Gr8 Chile relleno and Carne Asada plates, soups, drinks, chorizo and eggs, huevos rancheros.  Service could be better including cleanliness but the authentic Mexican food makes up for this.   Not a GR8 neighborhood so be vigilant."}
{"text":"The chorizo and egg burrito is delicious!!  We had ours with rice and beans. Absolutely perfect flavors. The salsas are bright and fresh. The burrito was served with a handful of crisp tortilla chips. The food was very good. The fresh squeezed orange juice is wonderful and the coffee was rich and dark. Service was fast. Great breakfast!!"}
{"text":"So today 7-16-15 my boss brought us all lunch from here. 

The first thing that impressed me was how hot everyone's food was.  Usually when you get takeout and you get it home it's all cold and soggy but everything was still piping hot. 

I got the double cheeseburger with fries and a medium drink ($5.99). 

I gotta tell ya...their fries are bomb.  They are the thick-cut kind and they fry them up real crispy and then toss them in salt and seasoning.  Absolutely wonderful.  

The burger was actually pretty good, too.  It had two patties, lettuce, \"special sauce\" (like thousand island), cheese, and tomato.  It was hot and gooey and really great.  I know what you're thinking...why the heck did you get a burger at a mexican place?? Well, I am la guera. 

Minus one star cuz' both of my co-workers ordered chicken burritos and one of them was given chicken and the other got carne asada.  She couldn't eat it and would have went hungry if it weren't for my other co-worker who very kindly switched with her."}
{"text":"WORST Carne Asada fries in the world! 
Only a promoter or someone who doesn't know better would rate it above movie theater food type quality.  
 After close examination of all the ingredients...
-Meat was poor quality and skimpy.
-Smothered in Super cheap nacho cheese
-Guacamole mostly filler
-Sour Cream ok
-Fries ok
And thats it... nothing else on it! 
Charging $10.50 and claim it to be the best."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying its spacious and clean taco shop, definitely feel welcomed & comfortable. Tacos de Asada & Carne Asada Fries was todays order & i want to let you know taco tuesday is a great deal & the food itself fills the spot. After having spent $20 on this meal & an intense burning sensation from the hot sauce, you bet i wanted water to aid me! I asked for a small cup of water or anything at all to get the burn down, This was not provided to me nor were i offered a small drink styrofoam cup just to put in that 5Star customer service. Yeah im upset about it cause now im thirsty as hell & ill have to go elsewhere in search for water"}
{"text":"Food was good, but I had the MOST horrible stomach aches the past couple times i've been here . Never going again !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hmmm... get's a 3 star because the service was good.  And the cashier thought I was buying a burrito for a homeless man when I pointed to my drunk friend outside.  That almost bumped this review to a 10 star alone.

I got a gordita.  Everything on it was bland.  The whole thing tasted of nothing, especially the shell (which I usually my favorite part).  I don't think I could even differentiate between beans, asada or tomato, it all tasted the same.  I get asada because it has great flavor.  I would have just gotten chicken or whatever was cheapest if I would have known the whole thing would be so flavorless.

Don't think I'll ever be back.  This was probably a one night stand but I will say that I can see why people come here.  It's clean and the service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst.. the good thing is the consistency.. Consistently there is minor debris on the floor, an un-stocked salsa bar and a very dirty parking lot.. not sure if they are trying to give you a street taco vibe with the parking lot being so nasty but truthfully it doesn't get much better indoors.

For a quick taco, or nacho it is decent, when your alone.. I wouldn't bring my family here."}
{"text":"You haven't had carne asada fries until you've tried here. I will never go back to Roberto's ever since I've had the ones they serve here. They hold their title of best carne asada fries in Las Vegas.

Anyways, moving on with the review.. This location is open 24 hours. The perfect place to sober up after a long night of drinking. The dining area is pretty spacious and resembles Roberto's. They're pretty quick on prepping your food so don't fret if you want food in your system asap.

I can't really judge much off the other items on their menu since I literally get carne asada fries each and every time. Trust me, you will too once you've had it."}
{"text":"Decent tacos - especially the al pastor, but overall not a fan of this pepe's. I remember the other charleston location being worth the drive across town, but this new one kind of sucks. Super nachos were crap compared to what I've become used to from similar places like Roberto's. This was a little bit of chips w velveeta and chopped up chicken, not fall apart tender chicken tinga like you usually get. 

Getting drinks near the general area of the bathroom reeks of sewage. Positives are good horchata and really great refried beans. That's about it - I'll stick to my tried and true Roberto's"}
{"text":"This place is an AWESOME place it's nothing like the chain places around town. It's great! So happy they opened this location so it's closer. They are really good Mexican not like those other places who \"claim\" to be Mexican. I think they are also reasonable prices too the place is clean and no issues. So I will definitely be back for sure!!!'"}
{"text":"This place is very good, local Mexican place, they have good, spicy food! Their tacos are great and they always give you a lot of food too. They also have these french fries with beef and cheddar cheese, man those are enough to fill you up! They are also reasonably priced also. I recommend them to anyone wanting to try authentic Mexican local food!"}
{"text":"I eat here from time to time because it's close to my house.  The last time I was here I ordered the carne asada super burrito, it was good, filled with meat in every bite, not today!  This place is as so unpredictable with the quality and quantity of the food it's ridiculous!!!  The middle of the burrito had NO MEAT!!!  Seriously! !  Not sure if I will be coming back because I don't know what to expect.   What is really sad is if the owners actually read these reviews,  good and bad, they don't give a shit about the bad ones, because you never hear from them......."}
{"text":"Great food!!!  I was feening carne asada fries for lunch break so myself and a few girls swung by.  I am so happy that I found this place the fries were on point the nacho cheese made it all come together perfectly- I ordered extra on the side but it's not really needed.  They give you plenty."}
{"text":"By far the best mexican food I have ever eaten before! Authentic Mexican food at its finest. The only little downside is the prices are sometimes misleading but in all honest completely worth it."}
{"text":"Been driving by for a long time and decided to give them a try. Restaurant is clean wasn't overly busy the counter help was quick. I ordered two shredded beef hard tacos side of beans and a fountain drink.  

Wait time wasn't bad about 20 minutes order was correct. Both taco shells were broken in several places, shredded beef was more like ground beef with no flavor. Sour cream plopped on the side of one of the tacos. Beans in a small container with little bit of cheese warm not hot seems like they are prepared ahead of time. Salsa bar was fair. 

Glad I finally gave them a try. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my fist and last time going. What was wrong with this place.... way too much! First of all its $11.00 for 6 rolled tacos. You can get 5 for $5.00 at so many other better places and this didnt even include cheese. Thats an extra 1.50. So it $12.50 for 6 rolled tacos. When i talked to the manager about it, everyone spoke Spanish in front of me to delegate the situation. Granted I know Spanish and am Latina myself, this is America! Speak English!!!! Not only is this rude to customers who cant speak spanish but its horrible business practices. After refusing me a refund even though no one told me the stupid rolled tacos didnt come with cheese (who does that! Rolled tacos always come with cheese and guac!) she asked the cheese to be put on the tacos and walked away. Other things wrong with my service:

 - Tacos were overpriced. $2.50 for a mini taco. You pay that price for a full sized taco at other locations
- Cheese quesadilla overpriced. $4.50 for a plain quesadilla that can buy you a beefed up quesadilla elsewhere. 
- There was half of a broken toothpick in my rolled tacos.
- The meat in the rolled tacos was fried to exessively making the it hard and jerky like. 

 I did go into this place expecting something great considering it seems so popular but im not wasting another penny on this dump and neither should you. There are way better mexican restaurants that offer better service and better tasting food at a lower cost."}
{"text":"-5 this place sucks!!! Only customers and we get cold food , carne asada burrito greasy cold , champurrado cold, asked for money back ... no money back manager/ owner wants to reheat the food !!!"}
{"text":"Everything seems very nice and clean very modern nice music the food taste very well outside sitting course not for tonite they even have fresh fruits who will come back with in this area it's definitely worth it"}
{"text":"I mean seriously?!?!?
This food is so perfect! The price, the quantity and well..... Locations could be better but I get it.... It's a demographic thing. 
Carne asada tacos are super. 
Go there.The end."}
{"text":"My visit was a complete Nightmare and I wish I could turn back time to have made a better late night dining choice. 

I paid $23.00 for two burritos, added guacamole for $1.25 each and opted for take out.

When we drove a short distance home to sit and eat I realized my burrito had no guacamole in it I was let down. 

If you are going to charge me for guacamole then I expect their to be more than a teaspoon in my burrito.

I called Pepe's to voice my complaint, the girl answered and spoke in Spanish. I asked if anyone was available to speak in English to assist me. 

She said yes is me and proceeded in English. I asked her name and she replied \"what you need?\" I again asked for her name she again replied the same what you need?  

I explained my issue and she asked for my receipt number and said hold on, she came back on the line and said my Kitchen Manager Hector said he put guacamole on your burrito. 

End of story."}
{"text":"OK so this is really a fun review I am excited to add to my Yelp collection!

At approximately 2am in the morning my Yelp buddy Jon calls and invites me for a bite out. Yes, even though I was already in bed relaxing watching tv, I accepted his invite as I am very spontaneous and always ready to stuff my mouth! OK so I got dressed, he was at my house in 15 or so minutes and we were on our way headed to Pepe's!

I had eaten here once before pre-yelp days. This time was most definitely Yelp worthy, we were craving tacos so tacos we had!

First off they are open 24/7 to satisfy our late night and early morning munch cravings!

The tacos were good, I ordered a chicken and asada soft taco plate which came with rice and beans. My pal ordered birria soft tacos which were delicious, I have never had marinated goat meat, he gave me a taste of his and those were yummy as well.

Reminds me of the street and truck tacos you can get in town, definitely better than the other more commercial Mexican food joints around. 

We had fun sitting, chatting and grubbing! Although the food was great I still have many other taco joints to check out!

Mmmm until the next mouth stuffing rendezvous I am out :) Peace!"}
{"text":"My baby girl and I are having a mother daughter day. The food is the bomb. My favorite drink is the pina jugo very bomb."}
{"text":"The menu is easy to navigate, prices are fair, cleanliness is okay.  I figure for an evening meal it has to be okay.  The food portions are generous but it was just okay.  I should have just went to my neighborhood Roberto's."}
{"text":"My mistake for checking this place out before checking their Yelp rating. I had it bookmarked when they first opened and never thought to check back to see their reviews. We came here today for lunch and was hoping to make Pepe's a new regular spot on our food rotation in the area. 

I ordered the carne asada gordita and it was ok but the gordita was really doughy and not as crisp as I would have liked. My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing. We also tried a taco al pastor just to check it out and it was dry and not flavorful at all. Definitely a lackluster experience and I don't think I'll be back. 

The salsa bar wasn't great and most of the food didn't look or taste as fresh as you hope for. This was a disappointing dining experience compared to so many other options."}
{"text":"Was there in Sunday for menudo!  New shop, friendly folks and fresh food. Nice clean and bright dining room."}
{"text":"This place is getting worse every day, I'm surprised still open, not just the food but now the service to, salsa bar was a mess and low in salsas , few messy tables and it seams like nobody really cares."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place after getting lost looking for another, and decided to give it a go.
As we parked, we noticed a \"Best Of Vegas\" sign outside and at that point we were even more excited. Upon entering we were welcomed with big smiles, music, and delicious aromas...and we immediately felt as if we were in someone's home.

I wanted to try just about everything based on reviews & tips, but decided on fish tacos. I must say I wasn't disappointed at all. As a matter of fact, these were the best fish tacos I've had at any Vegas joint, probably because they're made with mahi mahi and not some crap fish like swai. The slaw and sauce was also perfection, and I topped 'em with fresh lime and pickled onions. Perfection! 

I can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu!!"}
