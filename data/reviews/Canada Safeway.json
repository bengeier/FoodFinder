{"text":"Purchased a bouquet of flowers at this Safeway, but have been here a number of times over the years. The strengths of this location is the meat section. Every so often the will have meat on sale. The weakness here is the produce. I feel that the selection isn't very good. The flower selection is average. Not as much as a flower shop, but more selection than just roses.  23/30 Yelp 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"Like all safeways the prices aren't what I'd call competitive but the trade off is better quality produce, meats and people who have a sense of personal space.   Like all safeways in Calgary city centre it's crazy busy but the staff do a good job of keeping things moving. Waits for self-check out are reasonable compared to the next 2 closest safeways.  A good place to fill in the gaps between bigger grocery trips at less expensive places and check the store flyer for sales."}
{"text":"Grocery store which was not busy when we came in (Thursday at 8:30 pm).   The good: Great cashier service, very friendly. Not busy when we were there. Last row section nice to see (bread, natural products).   The bad: Prices are not low. Fruits and vegetables section full of palettes with boxes of products (not only dangerous but almost impossible to maneuver around). Big turn off on that one. Shelves were empty, or stuff in the back, or products unaligned with prices.  Thing is, this place seems to focus on production instead of looks, convenience, and service (which you get at the cash register). Disappointing."}
{"text":"New neighbourhoods mean finding a new grocery store. Not that this Safeway is all that foreign to me, I used to live up in Mount Pleasant and I'd stop from time to time.   Maybe living downtown has spoiled me, but I wasn't altogether impressed. It was okay, but the fresh food selection didn't seem quite as, well, fresh. Not as busy perhaps?  Anyway, there's not really anything else to report on this Safeway. It'll do in a pinch to pick up what you need for dinner tonight, but that's about it. Also, the parking lot seems to always be ridiculously busy and can be a pain in the pattoot to make your way into if you come in off one of the side street entrances rather than Centre St."}
