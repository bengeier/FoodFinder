{"text":"We went tonight to try the big taste yyc menu. We were hoping to try a few new things and learn something with the wine pairings. We didn't learn anything...I asked our server about the elk Wellington. She told me it was beef elk. So that's elk that comes from a cow? Ahaha hilarious. We asked about each wine pairing. She didn't know what brand they were.  

She didn't bring any bread or water, when I asked if we could get a drink she said \"mmhm\" and walked away. 

If the service was even close to how great the food was, there might be more people here on a Thursday night in downtown yyc. 

Ps the cow elk was amazing....."}
{"text":"I went here for an office lunch yesterday and my first impression was, well, was to stare at the ceiling practically drooling.  What a beautiful place!  Dark wood, floor to ceiling wine racks, candles, and that ceiling!  I was disappointed when we were led downstairs to a separate alcove (with space heaters) that truly lacked the character of the upper level. 

After we were seated, we were promptly greeted by our waiter, who was attentive, funny, cute, and had personality - I give him 5 stars.  I ordered a butternut with prosciutto soup, the Capesante Fettucini (scallops, asparagus pesto, toasted almonds) as a main, and a mocha cr√®me brulee for dessert.  The soup was delicious.  The pasta, I'm conflicted about.  The scallops were amazing, pan seared & browned.  The pasta itself was just so so - and SOOOOOOO garlicky.  Like burn my mouth amount of garlic that I am suffering for today!  There was something missing too, just not enough pizzazz - I would suggest lemon and salt, but hey, I'm no chef.   Dessert and cappuccino were both a solid good.  

Now, this place is slow.  I always expect nice restaurants to be a bit slow, but it took a really long time for our mains, then desserts to come out.  I'm a patient person, but I was really hungry and getting a little restless.  

All in all, I think the perfect rating for TRIB would be 3.5 stars - pretty good but definitely room for improvement!"}
{"text":"Very classy restaurant. The staff treat you like a big shot, even though you're probably financing the food."}
{"text":"Had a pasta and beef dish. The beef was beautifully soft and the sauce on the pasta was yum. Only negative is I think my pasta was a bit on the chewy side and service was very slow. This is not the place to grab a quick bite for lunch"}
{"text":"Unbelievable meal at Trib. Appetizer was Elk Wellington which was very rich in flavour. Main was Beef and Venison, which is a steak done to your liking (exremely accurate medium when I ordered) served on pulled venison risotto. The venison risotto is everything I would look for with venison. Plenty of powerful flavours with a nice risotto texture.
My wife had the fillet mignon done medium rare. It melted like butter and I swear chewing was only an option.
For dessert we had a toffee pudding to share, which was just right and not too sweet that we could not finish the whole thing.
We ordered the Canaletto Prosecco champagne as well. It was a warm day in the sun and they were able to seat us on the patio. It was not ordered to compliment the meal, just to enjoy ourselves!
The staff was courteous and the floor manager was out to check on us once or twice which we always appreciate.
Their special menu for the month was duck and I regret not trying one of their featured dishes, but I am sold on their ability to handle red meat and had to go with the regular menu.
I will be back, no questions there."}
{"text":"Funky and cool place. We stopped in here before seeing a show by Anthony Bourdain to discover he had just recently exited the very seat at the bar we were about to occupy. 
So if it is good enough for him, it is damn well good enough for us. 
PS: I'm told he had the prime rib :)

So I wrote that first paragraph during the first hour we waited for our food. We waited another 30mins and then left. We advised them in advance we only had 90mins to make it to the show and were told 'no problem'.... During that 90mins, not even a salad made it to the table, despite a few polite inquiries being made. They were busy, but there was no activity at any of the proximal half-dozen tables either.
Sadly, we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"A friend and I are determined to eat our way down Stephen Avenue before summer ends. We meet for a cocktail and appies and sit on the patio if the weather is inviting because the people watching is so great. (Advice: Decide beforehand how to respond to panhandlers.) Anyway, we had boar sausage rolls and seared scallops and, for the first time ever, I couldn't decide who \"won\" - they were both amazing. I rarely have sausage rolls because my mom served the best ones ever and most are so disappointing, but these were stellar. The waitress was very amusing and accommodating: She told us that the bartender was a real \"mixologist\" and really proud of his drinks. My friend ordered the \"Five Alive\" cocktail and was told that they could not make it because he was out of nectarine marmalade. In response, my friend asked if he might make something not on the menu and, when assured that he could, she ordered a \"Four Alive\". The waitress laughed like crazy and delivered the new concoction. I was delighted to discover that they offered La Crema by the glass, so had some wine for \"dessert\". The two gentlemen beside us had some giant pieces of beef delivered which looked divine and, as soon as we are able to celebrate a new job for my husband, I plan to return to sample one. Watch this space..."}
{"text":"Being in a carnivorous mood, we celebrated my gf's 30th birthday at the Trib. Our group was seated in a secluded section in the basement, which at first seemed ideal for a larger dining party, however the section was freezing cold and they tried to remedy it by bringing us a portable heater (it's the thought that counts right?)

Nevertheless, we made the best of the situation as there was delicious food to be devoured! After throwing back a few cocktails, we ordered our appies and entrees (I went with the seared scallops to start and beef & venison as my main).  Can one ever go wrong with seared scallops? The answer is no. The scallops were crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside and served on a bed of pureed butternut squash and drizzled with balsamic reduction.

My main was equally as delicious. The venison was shredded and mixed into the barley, topped with spaghetti squash, broccolini and nested on top of it all was my perfectly cooked (medium rare) steak. 

After entering a food induced coma, our server brought out a nice candle lit dessert surprise (warm chocolate & sticky toffee pudding) to our table. This is an appreciated gesture in my books, it's never expected and adds to any celebratory experience when you're dining anywhere.

Our server split up our bills, and even though we were a larger group she didn't add the dreaded \"assumed gratuity\" to each of our bills (this of course always makes me tip more than usual, esp if the service was above and beyond)

Great food with great friends in an even greater venue. Couldn't have asked for more, thanks Trib!"}
{"text":"When you dine with the former GM and you meet the Chef Ian, and you tell the chef to make us whatever you know this is going to be Good !!! This was hands down the best ribeye I have ever eaten period. The GM's Micheal pairing of wines from white to red based on our appetizers was completely delightful. The Chef sent our table and array of desserts that melted in your mouth and allowed your taste buds to rediscover themselves. 

I know we were treated by Chef Ian to a over top meal, but when you Challenge the chef, and tell him that you have not had a great piece of beef since you been in Alberta. You know that he was going to bring his best game. I just didn't know his game was going to be this great. 
The service was *****
The Decor was ****
The Chef was *****
The Pairing of wines was *****
The desserts was *****
The bill was $$$$
The overall experience *****
 
Now that's the Real Deal, and the whole Truth. 
Just Great Food. Just a Great Chef. Just a Great GM 
Just Great Service.
Just a note: The bill was very reasonable for dinner for three people."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and move this to the top of your happy hour list!

I`d heard about this happy hour for a while but hadn`t quite made it down to check it out yet. Until now. They have a selection of a white wine, a red wine, a select draft, highballs and appys that are all $3 from 3-4pm, $4 from 4-5pm and $5 from 5-6pm (Check it out! http://www.tribsteakhouse.ca/index.php/component/imagecalendar/?view=list&tmpl=component&details=true&cid=34).

I highly recommend the ginger beef. Sadly the pretzel bites no longer exist (although I hear from a reliable source that these were great). There's also $1 oysters (from PEI when we were there) and pate (which apparently ranges from really good to not so good).

I had a Cab Sauv and really enjoyed it, and the service was impeccable. I didn't get his name but the server behind the bar was very attentive, including offering me another wine about five minutes before 5pm so that my next beverage would be $4 again. Rather than $5.

The space (upper level, I didn't go downstairs) was very comfortable, even the bar seats were nice and big and cushioned. Plus booths. Booths are the best. I also liked the decor with the stone walls and Christmas decorations, with some chilled out traditional Christmas songs were playing."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Whim, for a quick dinner before a concert at Jack Singer. We were just walked by, saw the door and headed in. Coming in with no knowledge of this place ended up working in our favor - we loved the atmosphere in this place, it was excatly what we were looking for.

We were seated downstairs, where the decor is sort of rustic modern. Exposed foundation, wine lining the walls, hard wood floors and dark leather. Candles and low lighting helps to soften the masculine vibe in this restauraunt. 

We had a similiar experience to other reviewers when it comes to service. Friendly, unpretentious and attentive. Wine was ordered - fabulous wine by the way - and warm bread showed up at our table - my dinner date said it was worth it alone for the bread.

I ordered the double pork chop and my date had steak. The food arrived and, I was wowed. Lovely presentation, generous portions and amazing flavours. We were both completely pleased with the food. I was so impressed by my pork chop - I should mention it's the first time I have ever ordered a pork chop, so I have nothing to compare it too. But this...this was something else! So juicy, full of apple flavour and just a real delight to eat. We actually still talk about that chop. The meat itself was from somewhere in Alberta, I forget where but appreciate places that support \"local\" ranchers.

All in all, we loved this night. It was an intimate dinner, the atmosphere lent itself so well for us to have a nice Friday night date dinner. The menu is bit pricey but sometimes you have to treat yourself!  I will go out on a limb and say I recommend the double pork chop - but keep in mind that I am not chop expert! Would love to hear if others enjoyed it as much as I did."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I DEFINITELY not recommend to friends. Food and drink were under expectation and the patio waitress was not friendly at all and threw receipt at us  in the end. She didn't deserve any tips since it meant for good service, we gave it anyway. However, watch the attitude."}
{"text":"Looking for a steakhouse on Sunday evening, I found myself using the monocle on the Yelp App. At first, I passed on the Trib because it had 3.5 stars. I was looking for a quality place and thought it best to keep searching. However, after inquiring with my guests I determined there preference was to do as little travelling by foot as possible. Thus, in the end we chose Trib because we were too lazy to go anywhere else. 

Upon the advice of the greeter, we choose to go downstairs into the dinning room for the ambience. It did not disappoint and offered a wonderful contrast to the uninspired Stampede patio seating. It had Intimate lighting, a cellar to the north, nice roomy tables, comfortable seats and was very relaxed, but it still felt like a place you could get together with a group of friends.

Our party tried the entire Brushed Butter Reserve Angus menu; Striploin ($32), Rib Eye ($33) and Mignon ($36). All were excellent, well prepared and cooked to perfection. Even the grill marks were impressive. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the Shallot Wine Sauce. I expected it to complement the steak, but ended up not using it. It just did complement it well. I should of asked the server for the best paring. The portions are ok as well, but could be a little bigger for the price.

All in all it is pricey, but I loved the ambience and the food. It would be a fancy-causal (but more on the fancy side) place to double date."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a waitress who throws your bill at your face and doesn't even try to be reasonable, that's definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"We had particularly poor service here. The waitress took forever to get back to us after we asked her questions about the menu, and didn't seem to want to be helpful at all. One bad experience is enough to prevent me from giving this place another try.

So we took off, went accross the street to the Saltlik instead. The service was fantastic, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"We started with the crab dip, which was delicious and tasted so fresh. It was also so plentiful. For my main I had the seafood and spaghetti. It was just OK. The lemon chili butter sauce was watery and it had very little tomato in it. It didn't burst with flavor and taste like the delicious dish that was written in the menu. I did not taste any chilli butter.  I was disappointed. Also we had an unpleasant experience in that the waiter from a neighboring table spent most of our dining time talking to the customers at the table he was serving in a loud and annoying manner. Upon leaving I mentioned this to the manager and he said perhaps he was trying to make the guests feel welcome. Hello, aren't we guests? We did not feel welcome having a loud and annoying voice speaking through our entire meal. I thought this was an inappropriate response as it imposed on our table having a pleasant meal. There is nothing wrong with a server explaining a dish or two on the menu, but this server spent over 45 minutes speaking loudly and gossiping with the table trying to show them how witty he was. I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was excited to try their famous steak burger. I was glad I didn't dine on my personal tab as it was a bit of a disappointment. The sauce in the burger was quite delicious but it sort of ended there. The patty was decent but not mind-blowing. The buns appeared toasted but were not very tasty and the friend onion rings (two pieces) that come stacked on top looked exciting but didn't taste so. 

The toffee cake was not very good at all. It was overly firm and lacked moisture. 

The venue itself is bi-level and the lower level is conducive to hosting a private event. 

Sadface"}
{"text":"Trib's got a killer happy hour and they don't skimp on the service either. When you're dealing with $3, $4, and $5 drinks and appies between 3, 4, and 5:00PM respectively, you'd almost expect a catch in the service. Like those chain AYCE rib places for example; sure, it's all you can eat... If you can ever find your server to order some more.

Our server at Trib, however, kept my glass topped up and my appetizers rolling in regardless of what the clock said. She was even nice enough to do a happy hour last call, just in case we wanted to sneak in one more drink before it was back to full price. We did.

Buck-a-shuck oysters and less than $5 wine in a classy comfortable lounge with exceptional service? Yeah, that's a 5-star to me.

I snuck a quick peak at the dining room which looks quite enjoyable in that upscale Alberta steakhouse kind of way. I'd really like to come back for a big beef dinner and bask in what they really excel in. They are a steakhouse, after all."}
{"text":"I went here last night after a work conference.  We were seated right away.  It wasn't too busy.  Comfy chairs.  Nice atmosphere.  Not loud so great place to have good conversations.
Our waitress Kyla was great.  Super friendly and joked with us.  Great service.  
I would definitely recommend having a Ceasar Drink!  It was probably one of the best Ceasars that I've had. Very tasty!!  
They also have a really nice looking wine \"cellar\".  
We ordered the steak and scallops with green beans, shredded squash on a risotto croquette.  The croquette was amazing!  The mix of all 4 items was a great mix.  Different flavours and textures.  The scallops were done perfectly!  My steak was medium rare and it was ok.  The scallops were definitely better than the steak.  The croquette was quite impressive!  It was shaped like a hamburger patty, lightly breaded and deep fried.  Crispy edges.  I'd recommend getting this.  It was on the pricy side - I think $46.  We knew it was quite a lot of food so we didn't end up ordering anything else.  I would recommend going."}
{"text":"I've been to the Trib for business lunches and dinners a number of times, and have always had fantastic meals and service.  Great wine list, and fresh steaks to make your mouth water!

My most recent visit was to watch Olympic hockey over lunch.  We were able to get a booth right in front of one of the big screen TVs they had set up for the games.  We had great service throughout the game.  I ordered the Trib burger medium rare, but ended up just nibbling around the edges as the center was completely pink and raw.  I would order it again, but would definitely ask for it at least medium if not well-done."}
{"text":"I went in here for dinner on Friday night with a friend of mine, and it was an incredible evening of ambiance, service and food.

The waiter was friendly, well informed, \"real\" and witty.  We were well taken care of all evening.  He made recommendations on the wine and beer list, and checked in enough that we had what we needed, but he was not in our way all evening.

The food... well, I had my favorite, which is actually an appetizer that I order as a main.  I ordered the Black Angus Free Range Short Ribs, which are slow-braised on a bed of gorgonzola barley risotto.  The ribs are so tender they can be cut with a fork, and they are full of flavor.  The barley risotto`s blue cheese flavor is heavenly!  I also ordered the mixed field greens salad, and a side order of their market vegetables, which was a delicious side of kale and butternut squash.  

My friend ordered the mixed field greens salad as well, along with the pepper steak as a main.  The pepper steak is a 10oz Reserve Angus striploin, Dijon pepper crust, roasted potatoes and it also came with daily vegetables (kale and spaghetti squash).

Both of our meals were extremely good.  I am excited the next time to try the Stuffed Chicken Supreme.   I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this restaurant. The se on my boss and I walked in we were greeted by friendly staff, the two steak entrees we ordered were literally to die for! Next time I'm in the neighbour hood I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"My friend and I had such a nice experience here that we went back after three years. We found it last night and had a seat! Danielle took excellent care of us. Outstanding server. Made great recommendations, right on the service...great experience.

I had a filet. Delicious. The stuff potato it came with that was fine. Not outstanding but served its purpose. We both enjoyed the same entree similarly. We were happy.

To back up we had the prawns highly highly recommended by our server. She was right on point. Special. We ordered the Caprese salad. It was very average.

Both of our wine choices were outstanding. To round out the evening we had the coconut cheesecake. A first for me. I thought my friend died and went to heaven as she was eating it. Delicious.

Another lovely evening at this restaurant."}
{"text":"OMG! So good! I still dream about the steak here!
I had an amazing rib-eye with some delicious roasted potatoes and Gorgonzola sauce (on the side)
DELICIOUS!!! Melted in my mouth! I can't wait to be back!
We had a steak each and it came out just over $50/person with tax and tip included. Not too bad."}
{"text":"Terrific food! Interesting service, we were a group of 11, and it was not easy for our server to keep all of us happy at once. I thought I have had some excellent steak in Alberta, but this chef was  phenomenal. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really love steak houses, but I am a pretty harsh critic of them, and so when I entered into this older style, lush, deep brown woods, and low lighting atmosphere, and only 2 people were sitting at the bar, I was skeptical. It was 4pm and I thought a place with an insane happy hour ($3,$4,$5 at 3pm,4pm&5pm), would be busier. I then noticed all the reserved placeholders on the tables and there was actually a downstairs. 
The server was wonderful and friendly, and as my friends arrived, the drinks were always refilled and the attention to us was great. 
The ginger beef special was hot, fresh, and super flavorful and tender.  I wanted to eat bowls and bowls of it... sooooooo good. 
The highballs, (being a whiskey drinker) were a great price and it encouraged me to drink more.
By 4:30 the place was packed and the food coming out looked divine. It was a great experience, and I will def be back again."}
{"text":"The food was very good and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I really don't have any suggestions for improvement as I was very happy with my meal."}
{"text":"After looking through the menus of some local restaurants on Stephen Ave, my hubby and I settled on Tribune, as we were craving some Filet Mignon. The atmosphere is very nice, the greens salad was delicious with pumpkin seeds and sundried tomatoes, and the entrees were very good. The stuffed potato that came with the filet mignon was amazing! I ordered a sundried tomato pasta, and while it was very very good, I would likely not order it again--you go here for unique dishes, and you can get pasta anywhere. We also ordered a side of fries with garlic aoili--so delicious! For dessert, we had a mango creme brulee; there is a different flavour of creme brulee served every night, and this one was especially delicious!

After our first experience was so lovely, we decided to come back with mother and sister, and had an equally wonderful time, save for the rowdy party of six that was seated next to us-- had a little too much wine, I'd say. We tried the duck breast, and it was wonderful--the sauces that came with it complimented the duck so well, it was delicious. This time around we tried the lemon curd dessert, served with raspberry sauce in a crispy shell--it was SPECTACULAR! Mother was in heaven!

All-in-all, a beautiful, classy spot to go for dinner or lunch. The prices are not outrageous, as you get what you pay for-- fresh, flavourful dishes prepared by a master chef who clearly knows his way around a kitchen!"}
{"text":"I always have such incredibly fond memories of Trib.  

Out of the various steakhouses that we've been to here in Calgary (including Hy's, Caesars, Saltlik, and Charcut), Trib is still my go-to place when you're looking for a nice night out. 

I've been here for both lunch and dinner. The 'Trib Cut' Dry Aged Bone-in Rib Eye is amazing and great to share with another person. A huge chunk of meat (we're talking 36 oz here).  

Yes, 36 ounces.  

For $90, not bad at all and you'll leave the restaurant stuffed. It's so good. The only catch is that it takes awhile to cook (it's a roast), but well worth the wait.

The desserts here are top notch as well as the service. Great date spot, 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for a business dinner. Had the lobster max and cheese - wow!! Great mix of flavours! Also had the mussels and halibut which were fantastic! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Had a business dinner there last night and have mixed feelings.  First off, very clear Trib is part of the same group behind Murrieta's and Parker House.  All have that upscale casual vibe and amazing decor.  Trib in particular has the look and feel of an old school steakhouse but one that's been given a dramatic update (think more funk than stodgy).

Were quickly seated and the waitstaff were attentive without being overbearing.  

Now comes a bit of dilemma, how to rate the food.  For the four of us the starters were calamari, ceaser salad, mussels and mixed greens salad.  The salads looked great and the mussels smelled wonderful, however the calamari was soggy and extremely salty.  On to the entrees.  Trib is a steakhouse so what should you order?  Steak of course!  There were two fillet's, one tenderloin and me with the arctic char.  Everyone who ordered the beef raved about their meal and I could understand why.  All looked amazing!  The fish on the other hand, ehhh....not so good.  It was served with some some small mollusks, a potato galette and wilted spinach.  While the mollusks were tasty enough they were server with a fair amount of broth.  That broth caused the galette to get all soggy and not at all appealing.  The spinach was quite bland (maybe my tastebuds were stunned after the overly salty squid).  And the fish, was OK but definitely not memorable.

No doubt I'll go back but will stick to the beef."}
{"text":"Great service & excellent food!!.. Also, the location is very good... And the service was very friendly!!.. I enjoyed everything I had, and I look forward to go back there soon!!"}
