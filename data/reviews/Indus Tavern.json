{"text":"Ok, its a lazy Saturday and someone dropped a flyer at my door making the dog bark and getting me up from an otherwise horizontal afternoon,  But it was well worth it.  The flyer was from Indus Tavern and I looked through and made my order.  hot mutton soup                      6.29 lamb vindaloo                        12.29 palak paneer                          10.89 hyderabadi biryani chicken    8.99  The soup was thick and rich and a nice bit of spice. The Lamb was plentiful as was the biryani rice The Palak Paneer was very good, a little dryer then I am used to but very good.  Delivery was in under the 45min max and the delivery guy was friendly.  This was a great meal and I will surely be ordering from here again.  May have to try out their 9.95 lunch special as well."}
{"text":"It's pretty quiet on a Sunday night but all in all I like this place. We ordered chicken vindaloo, butter chicken and their paneer masala. It was good servings, great flavor and I will definitely be coming back! The service is great as well. The one thing I didn't like was the creepy stairs to the bathroom but even that won't keep me away from the flavor and beautiful aromas of the food. This is a sure place to try but a tad on the pricey side for dinner due to no specials."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from Indus Tavern this evening and were less than impressed.  The baigan barta was creamy and had no real flavour, the mutter panneer was also very creamy and lacked taste, and the tandoori paneer was dry. We also ordered 2 naan and 1 rice, and our bill came to $45 - way overpriced in a city where you can get delicious and high quality Indian food for half the price. Will not return."}
{"text":"Well, that didn't take long.   I've only been in the neighbourhood a few months, yet since I moved in this site has been home to Indus Tavern, which closed to make way for the oddly named Darsano Grill, and now Cloves The Spice. I hope Cloves The Spice does better, many because I hope they open a take-out joint and call it Cloves the Hoof."}
