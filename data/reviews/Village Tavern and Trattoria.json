{"text":"I went to dinner with my wife? and daughter last month, it used to be one of our favorite spots for a quick bite, until our last trip there my wedding? soup was extremely sour both my daughter and myself could not eat it we complained to no avail then my chicken marsala was not done the chicken was? RAW on the inside this time went right to the OWNERS WIFE. I was told to order something else that they still charged me full price for that!! After all of that they promised us a gift card that we never received and the service was worst than the FOOD. They lost good customers FOREVER."}
{"text":"As a self-proclaimed Reuben connoisseur, one of my most unpalatable pet peeves occurs when the sauerkraut has not been drained enough and the sandwich becomes soggy and the kraut flavor is pervasive. Additionally, while I appreciate a good buttered bun, this was entirely too much butter (or whatever) product on *both* sides of the bread. The sandwich was small, but it was priced accordingly. 
The sweet potato fries were a nice surprise, however, and better than most I've had at other local restaurants. They were fresh cut (or at least appeared to be), meaty, and fried to perfection. 
Service was OK, but nothing to rave, or thankfully, complain about. 
I'd like to return to try a \"tomato pie,\" the item my lunch companion ordered."}
{"text":"Excellent service and atmosphere and especially food.  Most good is homemade.  Nice mix of music and tvs. Has a formal dining area and the nice casual bar/eating area. Definitely will be coming back!!  And reasonable price and great specials."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. it took over 5 minutes for anyone to get to me standing at an empty bar, I in fact had to go find a member of the staff. once ordering 2 cold apps to go out took over 10 minutes to recieve 2 extremely small portions of which I payed $9.00 for... I expressed my need to leave and the bartender told me that she can't just snap her fingers and have food appear. I will never go back"}
{"text":"Wasn't very exciting. The foods was just OK.. Not what I expected.  I think the prices are too high for what you get. Beer was warm, and the soda was flat.  Owner (?)  Looked like he was in his own little world, didn't really care what was going on around. Will not return."}
{"text":"Went there with the wife. All of our food was pretty good. Very nice selection of reasonable italian an seafood dishes. Customer service an staff were really pleasant an nice sweet people. Only minor complaint was we went on a weekday where it wasn't packed at all an rather empty an it took longer than normal to get seated an for our food to arrive. I would visit again with family though."}
{"text":"We had  a great dinner tonight. Nicolle our server was very attentive. I loved my veal parmigiano. My wife had the chicken special and really enjoyed it. The wine list was limited, but Nicolle brought samples of a few Merlots before we chose a nice bottle."}
{"text":"Service was very good   Only small problem was the restaurant has a garage door to steet and the humidity was very high . The order was a pizza with stuffed banana peppers , very good and would recommend . Over all experience very nice to eat , would recommend"}
{"text":"I won't come back here. Literally didn't have chicken at 3pm on a Monday. Also didn't have meatballs? Waitress said Monday's are bad... I'm thinking every day is bad."}
{"text":"Our family was in town for a night while traveling through the area.  The recommendation for Village Tavern came from hotel staff for a \"local\" place.  I was impressed with the vibe of the place (felt like a Pittsburgh neighborhood joint) and most impressive was the staff.  Food was great, atmosphere was even better and our waitress, Josi, was the best.  Simply put, I could not have imagined a better place to visit!  If you are in town, check this place out!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food. Great value. Cool atmosphere. 45c wings on Tuesdays and 2 dollar domestics for happy hour"}
{"text":"Visiting philly decided to try this local trattoria.  Service was amazing and customers were friendly. The staff made me feel at home. Had a sampling of wings and fried zucchini. Great starter. The meatballs, OMG.  Don't walk by this place. Stop In."}
{"text":"Great food - must be one of the best kept secrets in the burg!!  
Wings: Tasty and done just right.  I got the dried Cajun.. tasty. I also tried hot  buffalo with parm on them (not on the menu) and they were pretty good too.
Stuffed banana pepper pizza (Village tavern pizza): this concept is genius!! ! It was the best pizza I have ever had.  They make their own dough - everything is so fresh.  

Fresh cut French fries folks!!! They were really delicious! 

Great service, it was clean and there is street parking or a parking lot practically across the street ... 

Bravo Village Tavern. .... Bravo !"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service! They have awesome pizza!!! I ordered carry-out and when I arrived they showed me that they had slightly burned a small portion of my pizza (so small I wouldn't have cared) and let me know they were making a new one, I could take the slightly burned (free) and have a beer on the house while I wait... Took 5 minutes. Great pizza and awesome people!!!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly amazing food.  I drive to get their pizza as often as I think to do so.  Their stuffed banana peppers are also great.  Cheap drinks and dark/unassuming bar make for a cool place to meet."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after going up to the West End Overlook simply because of the fact that they allow dogs. It ended up being the best meal we'd eaten so far on our multi-day cross country road trip. The service was friendly but not over bearing and the food was well-priced. 10/10 would come back if I'm ever in Pittsburgh again"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food. The Rich Cole Jazz band was great too. Italian food, cool music. Laudback. Relaxed ambiance."}
{"text":"food was a lot better when they first reopened. if you want something good order stuffed banana peppers"}
{"text":"This restaurant continues to disappoint.  My husband and I have given this restaurant a couple of tries as it is close to our house, not not again.  The service sucks.  we waited 20 minutes to be seated as the wait staff walked by us numerous times. We eventually left, as no one helped us. The restaurant was more than half empty!  We have gotten take out recently and the cheese sticks, were barely cooked, yet the cheese had melted out of most of them!  And some sort of watery discharge was leaking out also.
I'm all about given restaurants more than one chance, as every place can have an off night.  But we have never had a good experience at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went with friends last Fri night...pizza and greans n beans very good...main meals mediocre...waitress seemed in a hurry and not warranted since many tables were empty.  Bar area very nice...would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"On 10/11/2013 Jim and I needed a place to hold a luncheon for his mother who had passed away on the 10th. We were from out of town and knew that the Village Tavern and Trattoria had a great separate room for our lunch. Called Ray on 10/11/2013 at 10:00AM even before they were open. Told us to come right down. Ray has been a long time friend of Jim's. He greeted us so nicely and quickly came to create  great menu. Of pasta, pizza and appetizers. On the 10/12/2013 we arrived and everything was set up and Jade our server was very attentive to our needs. Food came out on time and it was the best! Everyone was very happy and impressed. The Village Tavern made our family and friends feel welcome and the food was outstanding. Everyone should have get-togethers there. They have a great patio."}
{"text":"I loved it here we came today on a Sunday and at 3 jazz music on the deck.   As if that wasn't a plus the food was excellent.   We ordered a lot we got the beans and greens and stuffed hot peppers, salad pasta and the pizza looks amazing.   The service was the best.  Great music and awesome food you really need to try out the place!!!!

Jam session on jazz every sunday"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon and decided to try the place out.

Parking:
 First there is no parking lot, it is all on street parking, which was fine because it was after 7 and we didn't have to put money into the meters.

Ambience:
Great design and layout of the location, brick walls, wooden booths, old wine bottles on wall.

Service:
Absolutely terrible. We never got refills on our water or soda. We received the food and never asked if we needed anything. Had to go to the waitress to ask her for red pepper flakes. The other waitress was kissing some guy a few times, and she never came over either. I didn't even try to get management as the lady who looked to be the manager was texting on her phone the entire time and looked uninterested in helping tables.

Food:
We ordered the pizza and it was absolutely awful. Think $5 antoons pizza in oakland. The middle completely fell apart. And the pizza was over topped. I never thought you could put too many toppings on a pizza. But it must have been close to a pound of hot peppers on it, and this pizza crust couldn't manage to hold it all together. 


Overall:
I will never come back to here."}
{"text":"Excellent pub with great kitchen.  Cool atmosphere, historical bar.  Great great great"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure how this place ended up with 4 stars, because I was struggling to give it two.   Service at the bar dragged it up, but that's about all that I have positive to say about the place.   

I went there for a wine and coloring book event, but had dinner at the bar first.  It was warm in the bar, but even warmer (sweltering really) in the restaurant section.  The food was freezer fare that they made an attempt to dress up a little.  The buffalo chicken wrap had potential, but the thin buffalo sauce leaked all out of it and it ended up a big soggy, greasy mess.  The lettuce on it was questionable as well.  The sweet potato fries were passable and were served with apple butter, which was a nice touch.  It's still freezer food though.  I also found it really odd that they were filling their ice wells with 20 lb bags and were serving soda from 2 liter bottles. 

Once I moved to the dining area, I wasn't sure which was worse - the sweltering heat or the \"entertainment\".  At first, we thought \"what is with this music selection?\"  The bar was playing contemporary country and this was stuff my grandparents would have listened to.  Then, we thought \"hmmm...this version of the song really sounds like bad karaoke\".   After looking around, we see a guy out on the patio with a karaoke machine.   Oh...that explains it.  It IS bad karaoke.   30 minutes later, though, we thought \"why is this same terrible guy still up there?\"  And then he pulled out a trumpet and clearly, it wasn't just karaoke night - this was the intended entertainment.  Yikes!"}
{"text":"If I could give NO stars, this would be the place. Disappointing. We've eaten here before and enjoyed our meals. Today we had spaghetti and the meatballs tasted like they had been soaked in a chemical. No kidding.  Aside from the first bite, both our plates went untouched.  The salad and bread were  good, but the spaghetti was foul.  Our waitress didn't bat an eye at our untouched dinner. $40 and I'm still hungry.   What a shame, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to good food as the menu sounded delicous.

I got the Greens and Beans with hot sausage appetizer and fried cheese appetizer.

Greens and beans were terrible.  The hot sausage (not hot at all) was ground up....could have been groundmeat.  There were carrots and lettuce in it.  Enough said

Marinara sauce for cheese had zero flavor and tasted like tomatoes straight out of a can"}
{"text":"Marinara sauce for fried zucchini was watery and had no taste, have to add salt to it. Chicken parmesan was okay, but not the best in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great food! Freshly made, more than reasonably priced and the owners work hard to make sure you feel welcomed. A real gem"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh spinach & tomato pie served by coolest sweetest bartender out under the roof at the patio bar. Nice n cool even with the crazy heat of late! A couple fun locals watch the game on the tube while two pairs of couples enjoy the ambiance separately. Ice cold beers help bring happy to the hours! 
Minus a star because when I initially walked inside it smelled of puke. Ha"}
{"text":"Great addition to the West End neighborhood. Food is always good and the service is wonderful. When I go local this is where I head to."}
{"text":"Great joint.  Very unassuming place and some of best wings in town!  They had me at 'wings'--the garlic parm wings!  Tuesday nights are their wings nights--go for the garlic wings.  Savory, crunchy, garlicky, buttery goodness! I am salivating as I write this! They also have great pizza! But their must try dish--greens and beans!  So good!"}
{"text":"Any local restaurant that serves a healthy side salad (aka. not iceberg lettuce) in Pittsburgh gets at least 4 stars from me! The Village T & T is a cozy little place, with hard wood booths and tables.  The menu serves traditional Italian fare.  I ordered the Zucchini Parm special and my Mom ordered the Chicken Romano.  The zucchini was good, but the chicken was out of this world!  And, as stated before, the side salads had no iceberg lettuce at all! Score.

The only advice I'd give is to have one waitress per table.  Even though the waitresses were very nice, we had two - two came to the table to take our order, and they seemed to switch off duties throughout the meal.  It just felt a bit crowded and I felt more pressure to order quickly because there were two people waiting to take our order."}
{"text":"We never dreamed that, tucked away in the West End, there would be such an incredible restaurant.  Authentic Italian cuisine, wonderful people and one of the best times in a long time at a local tavern.  The linguine and white clam sauce could not have been better -- light, smokey and loaded with tender clams over pasta cooked to perfection.  The Seafood Ala Scolio was better than any we've had at the traditional Italian chains that seem to be everywhere.  This dish is not to be missed.  Mussels, clams, scallops and shrimp a-plenty over penne pasta, tossed in a delicate garlic aglio with fresh basil and spices.  Portions were more than enough to satisfy and even some to take home.  The prices were so reasonable, you could indulge in a great dinner and then move over to the charming tavern for after dinner drinks with welcoming, friendly staff and patrons.  The owners Ray and Terry are gracious and show that putting your heart and soul into your business really pays off.  This is a place we will go back to again and again."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner there last evening.  We both ordered the cod sandwich without the bun and each had a side order.  The fish had panko breading and it was fabulous.  The fish was fresh and melt-in-your-mouth tasty.  I can't wait to go back and have it again!!  I should tell you that I am not overly fond of fish at all but this was exceptionally good."}
{"text":"Oh Village Tavern, you used to be one of my favorite Italian places in the burgh. But the last few times I visited, I've been less than impressed. 

My visit today was so disappointing. There were a group of 6 of us there for my mother's birthday. I think our server was recovering from a major night out or this was her first day ever with a job. I get it- being a server is hard. I stuck it out for 2 years and eventually gave up, because I wasn't a very good server. But NEITHER WAS THIS PERSON. 

We had to flag her to come take our orders. She seemed surprised like \"Oh, I've only given you 20 minutes to read through our one page menu. Are you sure you're ready?\" We had to ask for silverware after our food was delivered. We had to ask for coffee refills eleventy-billion times. We had to ask for red pepper flakes twice. We had to ask for our bill twice. I never got my water refilled once. I ordered a beer that never showed. We waited and waited and waited for everything. There was one other group of four in the entire dining room, so it's not like it was slammed. We still tipped her well, because- life is hard, yo. 

The food wasn't all that great this time around. I usually go for dinner and today, it was lunch. So maybe that makes a difference? My husband's Reuben was the most pathetic Reuben I've ever seen! If I'm going to pay $10 for a sandwich that meat better be at least an inch thick. My dad said his burger was \"meh\". 

I love their red sauce and their meat sauce, their stuffed peppers, and their fried provolone. The salads are good too! 

I'm not going to give up on this place because I'm an Italian girl who needs her sauce on Sundays, but I'll probably be getting take out from now on."}
{"text":"Tasty,fresh,friendly....and yummy!! Owner is very kind. Will b back many times!!! Kids loved the pizza..tuna was amazing!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing time! Never been to Pittsburgh before and this is a hidden gem! If you can go for jazz night and grab a pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered side salad with house Italian dressing, fresh & good.  Chicken parm sandwich, needed a bit more sauce but unfortunately the waitress was nowhere to be found,  nor was she around when our drinks ran out (which in my opinion should never happen). Atmosphere is cool, i really want to give a higher rating but the service really took away from the experience that it could have been. 
If I'm in the area again I will give it another shot in hopes that the service is better."}
{"text":"This is the best of the best.  Good food, good service, owner on site

Italian food is perfect.  Bar food is a cut above"}
{"text":"Great little Italian joint with a nice bar and patio. Fills a needed niche in the West End. Sunday is jazz day on the patio. Recommend."}
{"text":"It is fairly remarkable that with all the other better options available in the Pittsburgh market serving Italian/bar food that this place actually exists. While the ambience initially suggests otherwise,  the overall experience was disappointing. Along with some of the other reviews, my service experience was lacking. The pizza was freezer quality. Along with the parking hassle, you'd be better off just about anywhere else. I rarely take the time to review unless the experience is exceptional one way or the other, and this place would qualify unfortunately as the other. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I went here today with a friend for lunch, we both had beans and greens at my friend's suggestion.

They we're excellent!  I will return and urge you to do the same.  This place is a sleeper."}
{"text":"OK place. Service is iffy at times. Food is hit or miss but it is solid for the money. It's not a place I would go put of my way to travel to go there. I keep trying it hoping that I will find something that knocks my socks off. Still looking . The owners seem super nice and always go out of their way to say hello."}
{"text":"When you walk into the restaurant part of the establishment, the first thing that overwhelms you is the smell of mold.  After further inspection, we realized the smell could have been because that the place was just filthy.  The owner was clearly drunk and going from person to person trying to act friendly but when you go out to dinner you really don't want the drunk owner being at your table being a nuisance.  Won't ever go back!!!!"}
