{"text":"Super yummy pastas, ravioli, bread and pizza! We ordered a little of everything and it was all great! Good service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at Osteria.  First night they have been opened for dinner.  It was amazing.  We ordered the wood fired meatballs for an appetizer.  I ordered the marghertia pizza and the rest of our crew ordered the spaghetti and the ravioli.  For desert, we ordered one of each.  Sauces were authentic, pasta was freshly made, and pizza dough was wonderful.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A great experience... Thoughtful and attentive service, delicious food and drinks.  100% guest experience focused."}
{"text":"We waited a few weeks before visiting this new restaurant to give it time to smooth out the bumps.  Four of us visited on a Tuesday night, arriving around 7;30-ish.  The restaurant was half full with a mix of ages and families.  The decor is sleek and modern yet warm, very nice.

The Pros: we were promptly greeted and seated.  The restaurant has obviously addressed previous issues (mentioned in other Yelp reviews) about slow service; we had at least 2 friendly servers at all times and service was quick and efficient.  Drinks and food were delivered promptly.  They have also addressed the complaint about charging for bread - the bread and olive oil were complimentary.

The Cons: the menu is quite limited and a little on the pricey side.  For example, there are only 4 pasta options and only one contains any meat.  Each of the four of us had a different pasta and the other three said they liked theirs.  I had the campanelle with pesto and felt the the pesto overwhelmed the pasta and my palate after just a few bites.  A lighter hand dressing the pasta would be very helpful.

My Conclusions:  this restaurant has promise, but they need a longer menu if they want to attract people on a regular basis for more than just pizza (the pizza looked pretty good, by the way).  I'll continue to watch their website to see if the menu evolves, and we'll probably try their weekend brunch.  But as it stands, this is not going to be my new favorite spot.  We'll maybe try dinner again in a few months."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. It may be a small menu but each item was tasty with complex flavors and aromas. The mushroom appetizer was so good.- I soaked all the sauce up with the warm ciabatta bread. Chef Tony has done a great job creating an inviting space with food that rivals restaurants in Scottsdale. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great Italian Food and Excellent Service

Great Italian - Try This & Compare to Carrabbas or Olive Garden

First time at this establishment and definitely will go back.  Probably the best Italian pasta I have had for quite a while.  Had the Tagliatelle with the Bolognese sauce which was nice and thick and meaty.  The pasta was outstanding being homemade and actually impregnated with the sauce which yielded an outstanding taste and flavor not evident in the \"plain Jane\" pastas of most Italian restaurants.  Nice selection of wines and beers along with a variety of menu items and desserts.  Very hospitable staff and excellent service and food timing.  A MUST TRY FOR ANYONE WITH AN ITALIAN LIKING!"}
{"text":"Was out in Mesa, and saw that this was a newer place. Decided to stop in and check it out. It seemed like the service issues that others referenced in their reviews seemed to be worked out, as our server was on point. =)  They had a fresh, locally sourced take on Italian, so many of the traditional items were not on the menu. The sausage, pasta, etc. is all made in house. We started with the Caesar salad & meatballs, both were very fresh and tasty. My husband and I both really enjoyed the sauce that the meatballs were in. My daughter got the kids spaghetti, and really enjoyed it. I got the spinach pizza, my husband got the sausage and pepper pizza, and my mother-in-law to the spinach ravioli. All three tasted very light, fresh, and delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's a new place so they are working out the kinks. I don't have an issue with that unless I'm paying top dollar for their service and food and not getting it.  Which is what happened on our visit.    Food is very expensive, I left hungry and unsatisfied. It was a very underwhelming dinner experience for our party of four.  Pork chop was raw in the center, when we asked for it to be cooked a little more, the waitress's response was \"Well, its a good piece of meat so it's ok to cook it less and eat it like this.\"   Implying that I don't usually eat \"good meat\" and I'm
Not aware that you can eat raw pork if the quality is good.  Not only is that a stupid answer, its a wrong answer.  They cooked it a little more and it was good.  But a pork chop is $26 and the side dishes are  $10 extra.   The steak is \"market price\" and on this night it was $35 with no side and it was so flavorless and bland. Tasted extremely greasy, something you would get at Waffle House or other lower end diner.  When the owner asked how it was and we told her , her reply was \"Well, most people aren't used to eating high quality, grass fed beef.\"   Well, excuse me. Once again, implying that we don't normally eat good food and we are just not used to it.   
We eat out constantly and have high end taste and we know good quality. It was quite insulting to be talked to like this.   It's almost like they've come to the east valley to show us morons how to eat good food, except we already know good food,  and this place has far to go to meet our expectations, especially for the money they are charging.   I don't care if the beef is grass fed and gets hot stone massages  every Thursday, it was bland, tasteless, unappetizing and I would not eat it again much less pay $35 for it.   The appetizer dish of mozzarella is $11.  You get a splat of luke warm mozzarella on a dish with some very lightly sprinkled peppers.  No bread or crostini to put it on. When we asked for some bread, she brought it ten minutes later and charged us an additional $5 for it.  So this cold, hard splat of mozzarella is now $16 dollars!   The answer to them not serving it with bread is that \"they are new and just working out the kinks\", But they supposedly have a high end chef on the payroll.  There shouldn't be any food pairing kinks.  
Anyway .   For the money this place is charging, they are missing the mark on many levels.  When we left we all said we would never ever come back here.  Not for the money they charge the food they serve or the arrogance they dish out. Domestic bottle beer was $3. Best reason to go there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Great organic locally grown foods. Service great. Can't wait to go back as the food is unbelivable. The decor is also unique love it!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge supporter of local businesses.  My friend and I decided to try this place out.  We went on a Tuesday night at 6:15 p.m.  The restaurant was pretty empty with the exception of a large table (8-10 people), who appeared to have been there for some time and were finishing their food.  My friend arrived a few minutes before me and there was a water vessel and cups on the table.  We chatted for about 20 minutes with no interruptions of a wait staff person.  We realized this and noted that there was no wait staff within visible sight.  Another 10 minutes goes by and we begin to look around for wait staff.  Finally, a waiter comes over and apologies for the delay and claims it was due to the large table (which already had their food?)  We ordered our dinner.  Another 10-15 minutes pass and a different person brought us bread with no plates, we asked for plates and dipping sauce.  Our waiter came back within 5 minutes to give us plates, then he was followed by the other person with plates and the dipping sauce.  After another 20 minutes of waiting for our food, and see others who came in after us getting food we decided something was wrong and flagged down the waiter to check on our food and told he we needed to pick someone up and needed to know how much longer it was going to be.  He passed the kitchen and waived to us thumbs up that our food was almost ready.  After another 10 minutes we were super frustrated and had to leave to pick up someone.  This was super disappointing and unfortunately I will not be giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"Its great to find a restaurant open late on a Sunday to begin with, but what a treat this was. I had to have the GF (Grass Fed not Gluten Free...although it was) NY Strip. Deliciously cooked to perfection. My wife had the pesto pasta which was delicious as well. The pesto had a very fresh flavor with a bit a kick...maybe some arugula? They have only been open for a week, but have really ironed out any wrinkles mentioned in previous reviews. Everyone friendly. Service spot on. Food exceptional. Can't wait to come back and try the Octopus appetizer!"}
{"text":"Their ceasar salad and burata salad are excellent! I enjoyed the burata with yummy sweet cgerries and seasonal peaches. Their pizza rivals Filippis in San Diego! It's a thin crust and their seasonal \"meat\" pizza is awesome! If you have an egg allergy their crust, grilled (on an actual grill!) ciabatta bread, daily made from scratch spaghetti and buccatini noodles are made w/o eggs,  as is their gelato and sorbet. My daughter had the kids spaghetti and it was great too! The restaurant is cute and clean. The chef picture here is UBER talented and quite helpful. Their service is kind, quick and happy. Our server was Katy and she was delightful. Come and enjoy this Italian gem in east Mesa!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful, food prepared perfectly! Stuffed mushrooms divine.  Make sure to try the meatballs! Clean kitchen, great  ambiance, good experience and can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"First a comment on the older reviews that were not favorable...try it again.  Most of these were anywhere from a week to a month after opening.  Any restaurant needs some time to work out the kinks.  

It was our first time, having read about them in Phoenix magazine.  Very happily surprised with what we found.  Early on a Saturday night, we chose to sit at the kitchen bar where we had a birds eye view of the skill in the open kitchen.  Very clean and professional.  Having owned and operated a fine dining Italian restaurant, it was evident that this crew were very experienced. 

First courses were an excellent Caesar salad.  Perfectly dressed with a very nice breadcrumb instead of a crouton and the touch of white anchovies in the dressing really made it flavorful.  Burrata with beautiful peaches and marinated cherries was very tasty.  Could have used a bit of coarse salt to finish.

Entrees were the octopus for the lady.  Tender with some excellently crispy fingerling potatoes.  Yum. Also had the house made tagliatelle with Bolognese was super with a rich sauce and tender pasta...as good as mine, if I must say!  Had a taste of meatball with was also tender and flavorful.  Pizzas looked great.  Will try next time.

Chef and staff were very welcoming. They were busy so our server was a bit stretched but nothing to complain about.

Great addition to Mesa. We'll be regulars for sure."}
{"text":"Every plate was just amazing.  We had the Burrata salad,  Grilled octopus and Spinach ravioli.  The panna cotta was delicious.   Hats off to the chef - our comments on the drive home: fantastic, fresh and innovative.  Great care has been taken in the decor; the patio is going to be a favorite hangout.  The staff was friendly and went above and beyond to explain dishes and make us feel welcome.  This place is exactly what we've been hoping for in this area and we will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Wait staff is not trained, the tiny menu shows no creativity, wine list is terrible, portions are so small you will leave hungry, but the taste was ok. The capper was grilled octopus for $17 and all you got was the very tip of one tentacle (maybe 1 to 1-1/2) ozs and four fingerling potatoes. I had high hopes for this place but there are to many problems to recover from."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  We were a party of 6. When we sat the hostess told us that they were out of some items on the menu, which turned out to be more than half of the items; including 3 of the 4 entrees on the menu.  When we ordered from the sparse menu it took 50 minutes to get our food.  The only good thing was the wine which was overpriced. Why open when you don't have half of the items on an all ready limited menu."}
{"text":"Went to Osteria for the first time for a family celebration for 9 of us. Service was outstanding and the meatballs, spaghetti, spinach ravioli and even the vegetable plate were excellent. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is that the pizza was not good. The crust was very limp - not crispy and nondescript flavors. None of us would order pizza next time. But we will be back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough  about the new and welcome addition to East Mesa. 
I have been here twice this week,  for dinner and for brunch this morning.the Tagliatelle was a bit pricey but as good as anything I've had in Italy. The Crostini with Avocado was incredible.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.  The outdoor patio is inviting. There is a nice wine and beer selection.  I look forward to coming back often."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Sat outside and it was noisy.  Ordered lunch.  Husband's hot sandwich arrived and I sat for 15 min. with no food.  Went inside to advise.  I told them to put my salad in a to go box as my husband was already finished.  The meager salad that they charged $12 for was small and without dressing.  I asked for dressing.  It was 90% olive oil and something else.  Could not use it.  Overall, very disappointed in the menu, prices and service.  I realize it is a new restaurant, but small portions, poor service and high prices is not the secret for success."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful brunch. The doors were open and it was cool and breezy. Great service. Everything is made fresh so it may take a few extra minutes. Lots of drink options at reasonable prices. Brunch and dinner prices may be around $$, but the food tasted great and I felt okay for the quality. Thumbs up for me."}
{"text":"Great addition to MESA.   Pasta was delicious as was the Caeser.   Very good wine list and pricing.   Love the decor and patio!!"}
{"text":"Excited about this place. There are very few options nearby at this caliber, and it seems this restaurant wants to do things the right way. Good ingredient sourcing, good processes, and you can tell that there is a lot of effort being put in to make it a great place!"}
{"text":"Had the tagliatelle and a mixed green salad. Neither one was tasty or had any flavor. The spaghetti sauce tasted like Prego from a jar, no lie. It had very plain tasty ground beef. No flavor. I was just really underwhelmed with everything here. The service was not very good. They ran out of bread (it wasn't super busy), we had to ask for refills. My Arnold Palmer didn't stand out either. Again, just disappointed with everything here and have no plans to go back. Sad because we need good dining options in NE Mesa. Thumbs way down.  And the prices? Wow. We dropped $65 for a flavorless spaghetti, a small salad, one glass of wine and a fountain drink. I'm very ok with paying for good food but this was not it in any sense."}
{"text":"3.5 Star for this restaurant. We notice the food is a bit too salty. We ordered wood fired meatballs appetizer and spinach ravioli, and they're both salty. Pizza is OK. The service is so so not too amazing."}
{"text":"This is our new local favorite!  The wines were great; the burrata dish was amazing.  Our son loved the spaghetti and meatballs and my husband who is an awesome chef himself loved the Bolognese!  Highly recommend and we will definitely be back.  
Bonus - it's super cute inside- can't wait to go back when it cools down and the garage doors can be open."}
{"text":"It might be good if they get their act together. Sat 20 minutes before anyone came to the table. Pasta arrived cold in spots like it had been microwaved. Pizza soggy in middle. Nice wine list. Restaurant is nice. Love the patio and one wall open to the patio. But they need to get the food/service part organized."}
{"text":"I will go back but food needs a little tweaking. They are new so I want to give them a little slack. Meatball appetizer was great as were the salads we ordered. Spaghetti lacked flavor. Good homemade pasta but the sauce needed meat or basil for more flavor. I think it was left off our dish. Prosciutto was left off the pizza (we realized too late it was missing from the pizza. Margarita pizza was as good but could have used less sauce and a little more cheese. I hope it makes it because it does have possibilities."}
{"text":"This is an amazing, fresh and clean Italian bistro. We've been here twice. With service consistently great, food is amazing! Everything is fresh clean food. Local produce, nothing frozen. The patio has great energy, lighting and music. This is one of our new favorite places!"}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times, hoping that they would get their stuff together after a month. That would be a big NO!

Very limited menu that is VERY expensive.
Quality leaves a lot to be desired.

They have not had items available on the menu EVERY time we have visited. They even run out of wine! Like, 4 different ones.

So we asked for a comment card to leave our private feedback, and they were out of those, as well. Really? So, here is our feedback.

You can't do this part time, and you can't be understaffed.

I hope someone wakes up to smell the coffee, because we do need nice restaurants in East Mesa. This is not it.

We may try it again in the fall if it is still around."}
{"text":"So much fun!  Sit up at the chef's bar and watch them make homemade raviolis and pizzas - food is excellent - we had the meatball appetizer - 4 good size meatballs - very shareable for two.  The wine list is very reasonable.  Great food, great service and a fun Saturday night."}
{"text":"Like a fat pasta laiden pidgeon this place won't be getting off the ground . Was it the opening date being shuffled about like a back alley game of cups ? Was it the menu being gutted like a frail blonde in a B rate horror movie ? Is it the hordes of flies that make you feel like the young girl sitting at the table next you will start projectile vomitting and speaking in tounges ? The jokingly small portions that make you feel as if you are living in a small Italian village being besegied by the Saracens ? Or could it be  how disingenuous it feels just stepping in the door ? Either way come happy,leave hangry and broke ."}
{"text":"Make this short & bitter sweet.
Upon arrival the restaurant was wide open. All doors & windows were open allowing the chilly air to flow through the inside of the restaurant. Outside temp was only 65 the day we came for lunch. I was not happy to be subjected to the outside temps while sitting inside. Had I wanted to sit in the chilly breeze I would have asked for seating outside. Once seated it took approximately 5 minutes to receive menus. Only 2 tables were occupied at that time. After receiving menus I would guess it was another 10 minutes, closer to 15, before a server came to take our order. The menu selections are of few and of the few unappealing. Considering the location and atmosphere the prices are too high. And after receiving the final product, too high for what is served to you. I lunched with 2 other co-workers. We were all served our food at different times. Most restaurants serve their guests at the table at the same time so everyone can enjoy their meal together. My order was not as I requested. I requested an additional ingredient on top of the Margherita which was not accommodated. The bread that was served with the Meatball appetizer was cold to the bone. We expected the bread to be warm, such as they do at Vito's. The server never came to check on us. Otherwise, we would have brought this to his attention. An hour lunch break turned into an 80 minute unpleasant experience. I'm sorry to say but the three of us agreed  this restaurant is not going to survive if they do not overhaul their menu, change pricing, and enhance customer service. We think they would have a chance if they would increase menu selections with a wider variety, lower pricing, and train employees to be more attentive to customer needs. My coworkers and I dine out for lunch 3x a week in North East Mesa. We have no desire to try this place again. However, we wish them luck to stay afloat."}
{"text":"Stopped in after church for dinner. The meatballs are homemade and delicious ! The sauce is authentic homemade Italian and so flavorful. The bread is made on sight as everything else on the menu , could close my eyes and believe I was eating in Italy ! The salad was fresh and loved the crunchy garbanzo beans.  Everything is organic and locally grown I was told. For dessert we had the cheesecake and it had an amazing Graham cracker crust ! Of course I had wine and Don had a beer. Numerous selections . We will be back ."}
{"text":"Food is very good, very small inside area with garage doors open, it was freezing in the restaurant, not very bright! reminds you of an oil and lube waiting area, they will die during the summer."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. Excellent food and very accommodating to vegan requests. Great pizza and a delicious cauliflower side dish."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh & inventive Italian food in a gorgeous space. We loved the prosciutto cotto and margherita pizzas, the grilled octopus appetizer, the tagliatelle and the craft beer selection. Servers were super nice and attentive. Can't wait to go here in the fall so we can sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit. It is so nice to have a Scottsdale, Gilbert style restaurant bar in the east side of mesa. Appetizer of risotto, then farm salad, ravioli with spinach and spaghetti and sausage finished with ricotta cheesecake. With wine and a beer the bill came to $100. You could tell that the ravioli with homemade and so was  the sausage. All the desserts are made in house and are impressive. It's dog friendly. My only suggestion would be to have complementary bread served with your meal."}
{"text":"Super awesome place and delicious food...we'll be back. The beer tabs are heavy on IPA but man they have a variety... wine selection is great as well!"}
{"text":"I love trying new restaurants, new Italian restaurants? Even better. Limited menu but we all found something to enjoy. I'm a bolognese lover so it was a no brainer for me. You can definitely tell the pasta is homemade and the sauce was great. I thought my portion was a good size. Service was very good. I deducted a star for prices ($20 for my pasta - that's a little steep in my opinion) and with the indoor/outdoor concept the flies were absolutely horrendous. (We ate inside - the very reason why I don't like eating outside is because of flies...) Will I come back? Probably. Our meal for 3 people same to $83. Started with the arancini, which was fantastic. Entrees included spaghetti (no protein), tagliatelle, and picante pizza. All were good. Desserts we had were the ricotta cheesecake and panna cotta which were yummy."}
{"text":"New establishment, very nice inside with garage door pass through bar windows.  Very nice inside with a good beer and wine selection.  We code the pizza, I had Salsiccia and the wife Margherita.  The pizzas were great, really crust was excellent they use fresh ground cheese.  We will be back, it was good."}
{"text":"We had a big crew come in for brunch and the hostess greeted us promptly and had us all set up on the patio which was very cozy. I loved the open kitchen concept and seeing the pizzas cooking in the wood fire oven. We had great mimosas, an amazing Bolognese dish that they serve with all homemade pasta and local organic ingredients and also the pizza margherita which I couldn't resist seeing the oven. The staff was kind and friendly and the decor was so unique. Great new place and our favorite new local hot spot."}
{"text":"Great food, good ambiance. I love that i can take my dog to the outside sitting area - more restaurants need to welcome our furry friends."}
{"text":"Expensive!!  They must realize they are in Mesa; not Scottsdale?  Lunch shouldn't be double the price of breakfast with a \"little\" salad added to it. It might be worth it if the portions were commensurate with the price."}
{"text":"A friend had introduced me to this fabulous restaurant for lunch. My Daughters Birthday was coming up shortly so we took her and her husband to the Osteria for a Birthday dinner.We sat outside it was beautiful outside just perfect and all the help was very helpful , Courteous And they made a delicious dinner a Ten.  We had appetizers which were awesome the two men loved the meatball appetizer We had two different pasta dishes , both sauces were excellent! All of us said we will be back very soon"}
{"text":"This is an outstanding new place that we're very excited to have in the neighborhood! The food was OUTSTANDING and a great value for the price. The beer and wine menu was varied and paired nicely with the food choices. The service was super friendly and attentive. What's not to love??"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my husband, son and mom for her birthday and we had the best time. The atmosphere was relaxing with a great music choice. The staff was friendly and very informative about the menu. Our food was amazing and we can't wait to come back to try it again! Excited for a new restaurant near home."}
{"text":"We had a delightful meal there last week. Staff attentiveness was top notch. Food, both flavor and presentation were a treat for the senses.  Although it is a tiny bit pricey, it was worth every penny. We will go again when the occasion calls for it - loved this place!"}
{"text":"Went there 2 times during their opening weekend and had a great experience during both visits. Great beer and wine selection, and the Tagliatelle was homemade and as good as I've had in Italy or New York. Loved the outdoor bar and patio! Service was good as well, but a few times had to flag down a server for a refill. Prices were on the  high side and would like to see bread and salads included with the entree, but overall still a great value. It's great to have another east valley dining option that doesn't feel like an Applebee's!"}
{"text":"High end pizza and psta bar. Nice ambience but not a big fan of open windows with flies roaming around. Pizza and pasta has great fresh ingredients but had to season with salt and pepper. Maybe just to my liking. Overall, good place to try but not something you will crave for. Servers are pretty green for a high end pizza place."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. The cauliflower pizza was terrible. We sent it back. Ordered a new kind....it was ok. They didn't even comp us.  We ordered the roasted meat panini...not even a sandwich. The salads were very good and pricey. 

Actually the whole Menu was over priced. We sat outside, there is only 1 umbrella. There is NO happy hour food menu.

The place is adorable and great location. The food was nothing special. For Italian, no lasagna, chicken piccata etc.  There was 6 of us ladies and not a one said we would be back.

The only saving grace was our server Tina. Very attentive, professional and very upbeat.  Can't say much for our busboy. Young kid with NO personality."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. Had the cast iron pancake with my daughter and my husband had the Italian panini. The pancake was so good and served nice and hot. My husband really enjoyed his panini and offered us a bite. It was good. Everything is made fresh so you do have a wait for your food. Setting was nice. They have garage windows and outdoor seating. The windows were open it was a really nice day."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Mesa. Food is amazing, worth every penny. Restaurant is clean and gorgeous. Staff was so attentive and helpful. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough."}
{"text":"Best hidden gem! From the risotto to the ravioli this place is as close to Italy you can get in the US! You're missing out if you don't make your way here!"}
{"text":"Ok, look.  You can go to a lot of different places in this area and get the same old thing.  This place is trying to bring something different to the area, and I applaud them for it.  The food is fresh, the service is good, and I love it.  I had the ravioli tonight, and it was outstanding!   Alec, the owner, came over and personally introduced herself, and she was awesome.  I will be here frequently.  You should too."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. They were out of vodka and served us martinis in brandy snifters. The waitress apologized numerous times for running out of vodka, glasses, wine, etc. because it was prom night? Avoid this place at all costs"}
{"text":"Staff was attentive. Good was ok. To me lacked flavor. Very limited menu but everyone was  satisfied with their meal"}
{"text":"Osteria's staff is incredibly friendly, helpful and efficient. The food was delicious! We especially loved the grilled vegetables, ricotta balls, wood fired meatballs and the tiramisu. It also a beautiful and open venue."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today to try this place out.  First off, it's a classy joint. They have matching glasses and water vessels with their logo etched on them that really adds a nice touch.  The service was excellent. Our waitress explained different choices to us and made sure we were taken care of. 
I got the ravioli. It was handmade and fresh.  Very good. The only drawback was the sauce was a little watery. But other than that it was great. My mother got the farm greens salad and thought it was good. The table service bread and olive oil was nice, and the olive oil they serve is top grade.  
I look forward to going back and trying another dish. They do have affogado for dessert so I will give that a try as well. All in all a pretty classy joint for Mesa!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new restaurant, so I'm cutting some slack for a few things that are usually related to \"growing pains\" and will probably sort themselves out. 
Residents of East Mesa are eager to have some nice dining options and I think Osteria has potential.  We had the meatball appetizer (which was amazing) and the Pesto, Ravioli, bolognese, and salsiccia (mushroom pizza).  All the food was really good.  We did request a side of red sauce for the ravioli as it is not served with red sauce.  You can taste that the food is made from scratch and everything was really good.  The pizza could have used another minute to crisp the crust a bit more, but was flavorful and delicious.  The wine list is fairly good and the bread and EVOO is good.  We requested balsamic to go along with it and they accommodated our request.  
The service on our second visit was better than the first.  I would request that the servers not refer to me as honey or sweetie.  Others might not overlook this as easily.
I hope that Osteria will continue to work out the kinks.  This is a pricey restaurant for the east valley and although many EV residents are willing to pay for a nice dinner, they will expect great service and food.  I'm hoping that Osteria will expand their limited menu to include a few more seafood and meat selections."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!!  The staff is exceptionally friendly, and the pizzas were fantastic!  I really liked watching them make our food, as well as making the fresh ravioli.  We will definitely be back often.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today to visit this restaurant. I'm always looking for a new mom-and-pop family-operated restaurant. I had the fire oven pizza with spinach thin crust. It was delivered in an incredible short amount of time. The presentation and taste we're incredible. The service overall was very attentive. They have a very good selection of craft beers and wine.
From what I understand, this restaurant has started operating a couple of days ago. That said, the level of service and quality of food is exceptional. 
I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Great new place in Mesa! I loooove fresh pasta, and this is fresh. The Ravioli was made while we watched. The meatball appetizer was delicious. Loved the spaghetti pomodoro, was cooked al dente, pasta Bolognese was delicious! Pizza cooked in a wood fired grill. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious! Indoor outdoor bar is great. Love this new spot!"}
{"text":"Among the best dining options in Mesa.  Prompt service and outstanding food. I will eat here many more times."}
{"text":"Omg is all I can say.  My new go to for any day every day.  Excellent simple quality all organic ingredients put together in a way that hits all the points, site, taste texture.  Alfonso at the bar was the perfect accompaniment.  Dinner was so delicious we had to return the following day for lunch which was equally delightful.  The Cappuccino alone was worth the drive.   As a side note they use low-carb double 0 flour which makes it easy to finish your pizza- ours didn't stand a chance making it home."}
{"text":"A great new place in Mesa where everything is made from scratch at the restaurant. Met my hubby for Happy Hour and we had trouble picking what to order because everything looked so good. We shared the wood fired meatballs and a pizza. The meatballs were very tasty and perfect texture. The pizza was from a stone oven and the crust was thin, crisp but chewy.  The wine list is not long but there was a decent selection of moderately priced wines. Lots of draft beer choices.  We will go back to try the pasta.

So why not five stars: Service was pleasant but the food seemed slow to come out given how few people were in the restaurant when we arrived. The doors to the patio were open (because the weather was so nice) but we fought off a fly the entire meal."}
{"text":"Great food, but the service was rushed. I recommend and the patio is great. We enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"Mom and I sat in the patio on a beautiful Friday. Our server was awesome and very knowledgeable. We decided to order a little bit of everything to try things out: the Farm Greens salad, a large, lovely variety of greens, herbs, shaved carrots/radishes/cukes with a light balsamic dressing - YUM. The Pasta Pomodoro - a medium sized portion of delicious, housemade pasta with a 100% fresh tomato sauce (fresh from the garden tomatoes!), and the white pizza - which was KILLER. The crust was light and chewy, the ricotta they used was silky smooth - honestly the best white pizza I've ever had. Lastly, we shared a latte which was smooth and creamy with a full bodied foam on top. We LOVED everything about this restaurant. So why only 4 stars? The price. I'm a foodie. And this place was delicious. But $14 for pasta/tomatoes? Ouch. It might serve the owners well to create a lunch menu with lunch menu pricing."}
{"text":"worst customer service. went there for a drink an hour before they closed, and their were seats open at bar and tables. they said they were an hour behind with their service. just wanted a glass of wine, and they turned us away! i will never go back!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this little restaurant for lunch.  The three of us each ordered something different so we could eat family style.  We ordered a pasta dish, Caesar salad, Margherita pizza and meatballs.  The service was excellent and friendly.  The food was even more excellent.  I will definitely be dining there again!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this great spot in Mesa.  They are great about modifying to accommodate my vegan diet (and not in that eye-rolling \"she's one of them\" ways).   Great wine list.   Open bar to the chefs kitchen is fun and the kitchen staff in engaging.   

This was our third visit and even though this place is new we've been really happy every time.   Outstanding eats in an area known only for chain restaurants.   

Definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and the craft beer selection is the best in the east valley. We've been a few times already and have ordered pizza, meatballs, Italian meats panini and savory scones - all excellent! You can't beat their happy hours prices either!"}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I went to Osteria.  We ordered Salsiccia Pizza and some pasta with pesto.  

For the pizza it was okay, but it was no where close to what my wife and I experienced once when we went through Napoli in Italy.  It was average.  

For the pasta with pesto, it again was okay, but I hate to say that it was nothing like what I had in Montevarchi, Italy (near Firenze).  

Because of the following, I am have rated this as a three star.  While good, it was no where what I would call great."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Delicious flavorful food, great service:  try the wood fired pizza, order any pizza, do the chop salad with fried garbanzo beans:..and u must try the tagliatelle."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend and we are so happy they did. The food is extraordinary. The meatballs are fantastic. I had the grilled octopus appetizer and it was fabulous. All of the pastas are made in house and the Pizza is authentic Neapolitan style in a wood burning oven. The deserts are all made in house and are excellent. The flourless chocolate cake is probably the best i have ever had and the panicotta is wonderful. 

Osteria is open for breakfast lunch and dinner. The beagles and coffee are great and brunch is amazing too. i can't say enough good things about Osteria. Come to Mesa and try it. It's definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I went to Osteria this evening for the first time.  The three of us had some appetizers and shared a pizza, all of which were excellent.  The service was excellent, the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was very pleasant- the outdoor patio is far enough from the road that there was no loud traffic noise or exhaust smell.  I hope to go back there again soon."}
{"text":"I ordered cauliflower pizza,  it was very good !!, I would never expected to be this good. Will come back. The service was excellent as  the place so cute as well."}
{"text":"We have been to Osteria 4 times in the last month.
We have tried everything on their menu. My favorite dishes are the Bolognese and the pizza. The ravioli's are good as are the meat balls and octopus. We also really like the wine selection. They are continuing to improve as the wait staff gains experience. The chef Tony is first rate and he makes an amazing pizza crust. Try it, you will like it very much. Caio"}
