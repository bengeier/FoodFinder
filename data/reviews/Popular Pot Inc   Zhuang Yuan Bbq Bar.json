{"text":"Don't be put off by the unusual name and drab exterior, this place does excellent food and is much nicer inside. I've only been here once for the Tilapia hot pot- a delicately fried fish with vegetables in a steaming pot of sauce with all sorts of whole spices such as cumin, star anise, and Sichuan peppercorn (see photo). I'll be back to try more in the future."}
{"text":"do not go there!!!!
the food and service suck
do not waist your time and money!!!!!!

{"text":"Woo! Can't believe I'm writing a first in TO. Zhuang Yuan (or Popular Pot Inc BBQ on the sign)has all kinds of skewers and grilled fare: red meat, white meat, fish, tofu. Adventurous, we even tried the grilled leek: too fibrous to my taste, it was hard to eat but interesting way of eating it nevertheless. My favorite was the lamb skewers: well seasoned, properly spiced, and with good textured meat at $2 a skewer. I think the same spices are applied to all of their BBQ. This is my kind of treat: à la carte ordering and good variety. Tea is served as with all Chinese restaurants and it's cash only."}
{"text":"Everything usually tastes better on a stick. It's a hack, a sort of cheat I would say -- kind of like butter or bacon. These guys have exercise their right to this hack appropriately. They have mastered the art of putting all kinds of stuff on a stick; anything from the lowly bacon to the holy beef tendons? Even threw in a few Chingrish items that I have no idea what they are but we ate it anyways and to this day... I still do not know what it was.

This stuff is potent; often laced with generous amounts of coriander seeds, cumin and some spicy element. Proceed only if you are going to wash it down with lots of beer and beer is cheap here. I would say most of the meats are fantastically primal, greasy, salty, spicy and overall delicious. Maybe with the exception of that beef tendon that kind of reminds me of a giant white rubber band.

This is late night affordable Chinese grub food at it's best! And don't worry, folks usually only get shot on the other side of this street (don't cross the street after midnight). I guess when the food is this good people tend not to get angry and shoot each other."}
{"text":"The mixed vegetables dish was awesome, very refreshing cold salad dish with cucumbers, iceberg, peanuts, red and green peppers and a tangy spicy sauce.

We got the chef special mixed rice which was nothing special and the lamb and pork belly skewers which weren't that great.

I can see this place being very appealing in the late hours of the night but I wouldn't come here for a proper dinner. 

Service was good and the place is cash only but has an ATM in the basement."}
{"text":"From 4* to 2*. This place used to be great with very good food and fast service. But over the last few months, the staff changed and is now ineffective. The food is more spicy than tasty. 

The last 2 times, you have to ask many times for water and napkins. Today is my last time here.

Not recommending it anymore."}
{"text":"Good:
I been to this place couple of times now. What I like about this place is the food - I highly recommend anyone to try their bbq chicken skewer, it's really delicious and the chicken is so tender and juicy. Also their bbq potato, Taiwanese cabbages, and chives aren't bad either. 

They open till 2am every day so it's good if you looking for midnight snacks. 

Bad:
Be aware of the service, there's one lady thats always there and the service is very minimal. And tipping is also mandatory - they included in the bill for you."}
{"text":"I only come here for the skewers. Thick, juicy and generous portions for the price (3 skewers for $3.99). I'm sure eventually I'll try something else but the lamb, beef and pork belly skewers are probably the best Chinese skewers in the city. Halal Chinese Restaurant used to be the best but they are overpriced (2 for $4.50)."}
{"text":"Came here for our third meal of the night. Had the lamb skewers, small yellow fried fish, large white fried fish and BBQ leeks.

The white fish was great. Crispy skin and tender flesh. Would definitely go for that again. The rest was just alright. I thought the seasoning was a bit on the light side and everything was slightly overcooked. The small yellow fish had the texture of jerky. Same with the BBQ leeks"}
{"text":"Northern chinese style bbq. Loved the lamb, squid and cabbage skewers! Great seasoning with cumin, fennel and hot pepper. Also had the beef and cold noodles which were done well. Good value and would definitely go again. 

Recommend if you love bbq and spicy skewers!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here more than a dozen times now since it opened and the food is incredibly consistent every visit for a Chinese restaurant in this price range. Spicy and delicious. The sautéed dishes, the Korean cabbage skewers, as well as the griddle intestines (if you're into that sorta thing) are standouts.

While the service was a little spotty at times due to waiting staff changes, it's generally been quite prompt at least in my experience. Just put your hand up to wave a wait staff over.

Also can't go wrong with $10 pitchers of subpar house beer ;)

Pretty authentic Northern/Central Chinese restaurant in both food and feel. 5 stars for amazing value at this price range of $10-20/person after tax & tip."}
