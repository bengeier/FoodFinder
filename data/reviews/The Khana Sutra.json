{"text":"Good restaurant with nice decor. Food can be much better. Limited choice for vegetarian soups which can also be looked at especially for cold weather."}
{"text":"I totally enjoyed meal here.  I was driving by and the sign caught my eye.  I went in and was seated right away.  my waitress was very helpful I. suggesting food options.  I wound up getting what my server suggested.  basically a spicy chicken appetizer that was great followed by a green sauced chicken dish with garlic naan.  Finished with rice pudding g dessert.  was a lovely dinner."}
{"text":"Great ambience .. Good food .. Worth the money .. Service was very good. Should go ..."}
{"text":"This place would've received 5 stars if it wasn't for the rude owner.   At 6:30 pm, in an almost empty restaurant, she felt overwhelmed because we requested a table change for 4 people. We hadn't even placed our order yet. In anticipation of the live music, we did not wish to sit next to the speakers. While the waitress, tried to find another table, the owner started complaining to the staff about relocating. She did not even stand up from her place to address the matter. There was 1 other family, the entire restaurant had empty tables. Her tone and attitude lacked any form of professionalism, or customer service. Sadly, she had the attitude of someone who likes to bark orders and is apathetic about everyone and anything.    Service: 5/5 We were waited on by a young lady who was extremely friendly and helpful. She tried her best to apologize on behalf of the owner. It was sad to hear that none of the waiting staff liked the owner either. This really spoke volumes.  Anyways now onto the good things.   Food: 5/5 We loved the appetizers, very different and great taste. I highly recommend their Dahi Kabab (best thing ever) and Purani Dilli Ki Palak Chat. I felt it was innovative and quite tasty, felt good to try something other the typical Indian appetizers.   Ambience 5/5: we were here on a weekend, there was lovely live music playing. Song requests are more than welcome. Songs are of the old bollywood classics genre. Felt like this would be a great place for a date.    It's a shame that the owner tainted our experience but I would go for the food and ambience!"}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant. This is one of the finest Indian restaurant I have seen. The ambiance is great. The food quality and selection is good. The only downside is that you are paying more to get this overall quality. But it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Had my sons first birthday here and the overall experience was excellent.  The party room which fits up to 70 people is a great space.  The buffet was fresh,  and the food kept on coming.  Lastly the service was fantastic, the staff and owners worked really hard to make sure everything went off without a hitch.  More people need to check this place out."}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful and the food is amazing especially chicken tikka tandoori and naan. This place also has live music from wed to Sunday and the stafff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Went on a weeknight and they had live entertainment with someone singing classic and current Bollywood songs and some customers also got up on stage and did some Bollywood karaoke themselves. A nice place for a family dinner. It was our first time and we kind of went in with low expectations but were blown away at how flavourful the food is. The service was amazing too. Food and drinks came on time and the servers were really attentive. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I visit Brampton often and have been to the Khana Sutra a few times during weekdays for both lunch and dinner. I have also gotten dishes for takeout. It is a very clean and tastefully designed restaurant. Each time I was there the service was great. The staff were kind, caring and knowledgeable about their dishes, helping us pick our dishes with great recommendations.   For lunch, I have tried their lunch special non-vegetarian platter. It was tasty but since I eat a lot, I still felt hungry when I was finished my dishes. However, I asked for more rice, Dal and chicken curry and they provided me with more without a charge. For dinner, the appetizer we ordered was Bhuta Makaii. It was truly special. For the main course, we tried Paanch Mirchi Ka Paneer aand Ghosht Shehnai and a chicken dish from Tandoor. All were great but for me Ghosht Shehnai was out of this world. If you are non-vegetarian be sure to try Ghosht Shehnai.  For most dishes you have to order rice, naan or Roti separately. As such, the overall cost of the dinning in my opinion would become a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Just had a pretty expensive lunch for two and the bill was $65 Canadian Dollars.  They do have a lunch special in the $14-15 range but it is mostly loaded with vegetables and only one meat item and we decided to do the menu instead of the special.  My overall impression is that food is average and comparable with other Indian restaurants.  However, the price is almost double or at least 150% of the other comparable Indian restaurants.  My colleague said that was the first and last time we come to this restaurant and I tend to agree with him."}
{"text":"Seiously a decent food, super clean staring from the restaurant it self, and foood is toppp noch, my first time but i know ill come here at least once a week from now on"}
{"text":"A lot more interesting places than this one. Food just did not taste good - looks like the chef has forgotten how salt as a spice exists. Don't usually leave negative reviews but my expectations were high and this was a pretty down."}
{"text":"Great, quick service, food was delicious and not overly spicy. Really nice that the hostess allowed substitution for raita, much appreciated. Loved that the little bowls can be refilled:) would definitely go again and recommend."}
{"text":"Just happened to drop in here tonight with my husband.  Impressed right from the beginning.. We were greeted warmly at the door and shown to our seat by the owner's wife. Very nice atmosphere and extremely hospitable service.  They were setting up for a one man live singing show and the singer was excellent.  We had the lamb chop appetizers which was delicious.  Our mains were prawns made with garlic and butter and I have never tasted more delicious prawns.  They were cooked to perfection and the sauce was delicious.  So flavourful. The other main was the chicken tikka.and that also was very good.  The garlic naan was one of the best I have ever had.  We were impressed with everything.  They paid attention to all the little details and we noticed.  The massala tea was good and was served in teacups that had been heated so the tea stayed hot until the last drink.  Even their plain rice was delicious.. I forgot the name ( it had geera/cumin and I think fried onions and saffron  in it.  Totally impressed.  They have live music from Wed to Sunday and it makes for a nice date night or perfect place to celebrate a birthday with friends and family.  Check it out."}
{"text":"pricey but above average experience I suppose.  There was also live entertainment on this visit however, I was laying out a few options of each item that i ordered onto my plate when I was interrupted by the server who asked if I was parting the Red Sea?... I'm offended."}
{"text":"Would not visit this place. Both me and my wife had an upset stomach after lunch here. The food was definelty not freshly made but reheated and serves. Would definelty not visit again."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the Shrimp Tandoori. We also ordered the lamb bryani but found the rice a bit dry. Overall it was a wonderful experience and we'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I would give this place negative stars if I could. Awful customer service. I wasn't happy with the butter chicken that we first ordered, so we ordered the malai kofta afterwards. When the waitress brought it over, I noticed there was a hair in it. I kindly told her that there's a hair in this and requested that she take the dish away altogether as I obviously wouldn't want it. Normally places apologize and would gladly do this AND don't even charge you for it. She answered with \"I can't do that, sorry.\" I'm sorry, what? After we then requested for her to bring out a new dish of the malai kofta so we could actually eat what we're paying for, she said she couldn't do that either. We then replied with \"You want us to pay for and eat something with hair in it?\" She carelessly answered, \"No, you can pack it and take it home.\" Aside from the awful food and even worse customer service, the final bill altogether was over $40.00 for a few pieces of naan, a watered down/flavourless butter chicken, and an untouched dish of malai kofta with a hair still in its place. Disappointing. Will never return."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY.  check your bill as they will charge you for items you did not order.  Also food gave us instant food poisoning. Horrible service also"}
{"text":"Once you walk in, looks awesome and the environment is awesome. I ordered the Chicken Tikka which came with cream & brandy. I specially asked for no brandy as I don't drink & no cream as I am lactose intolerant. I received my food in a nice period of time, however there was so much cream. I told the waitress or daughter of the owner that this has a lot of cream, she cleared my table and had me waiting for a replacement without cream this time. I receive the order and the chicken wasn't fresh at all and smelled bad, also it was undercooked. I was hungry, I ate the food and left a fair amount behind. I thought it would be a restaurant with awesome food, specially the fact they're replacing Denny's old location. I would not recommend this place. Try Indian Hero, they never disappoint & make food with love, it's always fresh or try Kazana by Sanjeev Kapoor, amazing lamb chops & chicken tikka!! Giving them 3 stars because I feel bad and don't want to give them a 2 star rating, it would hurt their rating, also why I never wrote this review on Google. Sorry but had to be done. I like writing honest but positive reviews, saddened that I have to write a negative one."}
{"text":"While driving along Queen St, I saw this restaurant being constructed in the spot where Denny's used to be. My first thought was... This restaurant name has to be some kind of pun, right? Sure enough, khana means food, and the restaurant's tagline is \"the pleasures of taste\". Ha. Bookmarked.  Today, I had the chance to go and check it out. The interior isn't particularly exciting, with pink walls and south Asian artifacts throughout. It gives off a homey, loungy vibe. If you look closely, you can probably see how this place used to be a Denny's.   On to the menu - I came for lunch on a weekday. They have a special on weekdays from 11-3 - a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian thali. This consists of either chicken or paneer (for veg/non-veg), three curries featuring potato, lentils, and cauliflower, yogurt, naan, basmati rice, and mago salad.  For $13.95 for the non-vegetarian option, this was a pretty good deal.   I liked most of the food - the rice was well-seasoned, naan fresh and buttery, and chicken moist and tender. My favourite curry was the one with the cauliflower - I can't remember exactly what it was called. All 3 of the curries were good though, and came in a decent enough portion. The salad was the throwaway here - just some iceberg lettuce, cucumbers, and the mango wasn't particularly sweet or juicy.   Service was quick and attentive. They often came to check up on us to see if everything was alright. They also had no problem splitting our bills though we had not asked prior to printing.   For a workbreak lunch, time wasn't an issue either. There weren't many other patrons in the restaurant so it may have been faster than usual, but you can squeeze in a generously portioned meal here in under an hour.   Khana Sutra is definitely a place worth coming back to. I worry a bit as Khazana just down the street has a much larger backing in the culinary industry as it is owned by Sanjeev Kapoor, but Khana Sutra should do just fine when customers are looking to have an experience that feels a little more like home."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner at Khana Sutra on a Saturday evening.  Menu was very crafty and offered many options. We had a vegetarian Hara Bhara Kebab as starter. The server explained well all the dishes. The main course we picked was Dariyaganj ka Butter Chicken which turned out to be  a disappointment. It was too white washed to be authentic.   The biggest delight of the night was the Live music. I would go again for the experience."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience. Live band. Very very tasty food, must try tandoori platter, and best of all very warm hospitality. Just amazing well spent friday night"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been in for over a year and is quickly gaining  a reputation. What makes this place special is the Live Singer performance that takes place on  evenings. The ambience is pretty good and the host (owner and his wife) are very friendly. The staff is attentive although the gets very busy in the evenings. Check out their Sizzlers  in their appetizer section. It's pretty awesome. The Biryani is something  that I liked  -- the  preparation was nice and the spice level was catered to my taste buds. I'd go back there definitely for the live music more than the food (which is on par with the other restaurants). And yes, if you are a singer and would like to sing out there, the place let's you do that. Most of the \"guests\" show their talent and the audience loves it."}
{"text":"Love the decor and the homely feel to the place. My mother was in the mood for some Indian food and had been eyeing this place the past few weeks as we drive down Queen Street on our way to work daily, and this place always catches our eyes due to the interesting name.   We walked in and the place was phenomenally empty. Due to that, we were hesitant but the woman working there made us feel welcome and seated us, presenting the menu promptly. While I found the portions to be rather small for what they are priced at, the food was still very delicious. The emptiness and silence however made it uncomfortable for us to freely talk about our day and personal matters, as one can freely do in more busier - louder - atmospheres without feeling judged or eavesdropped on alas, that was probably our own fault for deciding to come on a weekday and that too, in the afternoon.   Overall, cute place and lovely staff. Would I return? Probably, on a more busier note. :)"}
{"text":"@TheKhanaSutra #THEKHSUTRA #BRAMPTON #INDIANRESTAURANT #YELPGTA  This place is a big turnoff for me because of the tacky decor - think bright salmon walls, gaudy gold on chairs, over the top try too hard decor. I am not into that. They tried to create some ambience in an empty restaurant by having a gentleman sing. I felt bad because he wasn't doing a great job and it was literally just 4 of us there for a birthday dinner.   The service was lazy - no servers. The owner basically served us that evening. They do serve alcohol and for drinks I ordered a Paan Cocktail I wasn't a huge fan of. The food wasn't too bad. We ordered a couple of shareables:   For starters we ordered a vegetarian spinach and paneer kabab (Hara Bhara Kabab) and some chicken tikka, both of which weren't bad at all. And not spicy (thank god).   For mains, we ordered paneer dumplings (Malai Kofta) and butter chicken. The Malai Kofta was amazing and the butter chicken was rather bad.   And as sides, we ordered Naans and Rumali Roti. Rumali Roti is this super thin bread that is usually really nice, long and stretchy. I can't say it was very good at The Khana Sutra. The name of the restaurant is a bit inappropriate too. You won't find me back here again."}
{"text":"Had tiffin chicken, curry shrimp (chef's special), and spinach corn green sauce/curry (forgot the name) paired with garlic naan.   The chicken and shrimp are slightly salty for me (I kind of have a lighter taste preference), however, pairs perfectly with the naan. The spinach corn sauce tasted really good, just the right level of flavour overall.   The naan is perfect, much order! We will come back to visit next time in town for sure.   Also ordered the grilled pineapple, never tried it before, but pretty good as well. Sweet juicy pineapple blended well with the grilling sauce, which is slightly spicy.   Overall review is 8/10!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best Indian food I've ever had. Ask for their version of the chicken tikka masala, it is amazing!  The owner is incredibly nice and the atmosphere is great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tip:  If you're coming for dinner, it's best to go in a big group so that you can share more items.  It can get a bit pricey for 2ppl as you'd probably only order a couple of dishes.  The fountain as you enter, décor, wine glasses on the table, & chandeliers should've been my first indication that this isn't a joint that serves free naan/rice with their meals!  Ordering naan/rice separately, the slightly higher than usual prices, and smaller portions, you are essentially paying for better service, atmosphere, fresher food, & if you're lucky, live entertainment!  The singer started around 7:45-8pm on a Friday evening, so unfortunately, I had to leave early on during his performance.  His voice was very calming though, so live entertainment is a nice touch.  Menu contained items that I have never even heard of before and is quite extensive.  However, waitress did offer up suggestions and to explain certain items that I had questions about.  I believe there was a brief description for each item.  Menu was also bound and looked like a beautiful book.  Other than the outdated pink walls and curtains, the other décor is nice.  All servers were very polite, smiley, friendly, & helpful.  Everything that I had was good.  Again portions were on the smaller side and average prices seem to be ~$13-15/dish.  I should've ordered something from the tandoor 'cause it smelled soo good.  It's better to come in a bigger group, I'd say 4+ppl if you're coming for dinner.  My meal for 2 + a serving of naan, no drinks/dessert was $35, so it's not your hole-in-the-wall Indian place!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place.  The decor is colorful and playful.  But the showcase is the food. I started with the amazing Gunpowder Aloo.  Outstanding flavor - the spice plays perfectly with the rich, perfectly cooked potatoes.  I love heat when it enhances the flavor.  This dish is spot on. Since I have a habit of over ordering I followed that with Butter Chicken and an order of Tandori Roti and Garlic Naan.  I've eaten Butter Chicken all over; and hands downs this was the best I've ever had.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was perfect.  It was hard not to use he spoon just to enjoy the sauce.  The Garlic Naan was a revelation.  That and a Kingfisher would make a great meal.  The Roti was also good."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant. Their kabobs and butter chicken is extremely good. They also have live music in the evening after 7, which is always great! Four stars only because the servers were not the most efficient."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Great service. Live music. Good vibe all around. Would recommend to anyone. If you ask your food to be sliced up, it will be Hott!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out a couple weeks ago. We came craving Indian food and left completely satisfied. The portions were not huge but great for the both of us. We had the Butter Chicken (spicy) and the Chicken Tikka Masala with a sides of garlic naan,rice and salad.  Everything was delicious especially the crisp garlic naan!  Overall, quick and friendly service and great food, although it was a little more on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from the, via Uber Eats, first time using this service in Brampton and wow what a crap experience. Food was made and delivered on time but thats about all they got right. The Malai Kofta was horrible, like gross, and the Butter Chicken tasted like what I imagine it would taste like if it was made by prisoners in a supermax penitentiary by people who've never eaten the dish before. Just so bland. Ordered Garlic Naan and Tandoori rotis, both tasted bad and were soggy and I've eaten store bought naan that tasted better. Kuchumber salad was basically a box filled with poorly chopped carrots and onions, really bland and boring, not what I was expecting at all.  All in all place was a serious let down so avoid at all costs as there are hundreds of decent Indian joints in Brampton but you should never order form this place unless you have no idea what good India food is supposed to taste like, then maybe you might like it. Otherwise you'd be safer with fast food."}
