{"text":"The food was too typical & too processed. The jukebox was way too loud, when the place was 2/3rd's empty. :-("}
{"text":"This is the perfect neighborhood bar. Great specials for both food and drinks, clean, pool table, great open space and friendly staff. They have a lot of cool and creative cocktails but the best thing is the empanadas (or empanadillas). I have had a lot of good empanadas in my life in a lot of different places and these ones are on top of my list. For been a bar I was expecting pretty simplistic food but they really go out of their way. I cannot wait to try more things from their menu. They have parking available and there is also street parking. I haven't been here on the weekends but heard it was a great vibe. Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"very nice place for the area....it is actually a beautiful bar but the clientele is anything but...if you are Latino you'll fit right in...if not, then don't look anybody in the eye and keep your girl close by...lol...it is safe and secure for the area, being that the 2nd district police station is across the street...drink prices are on the high side but they usually have an avg dj blasting reggaeton or Drake til you can't take it anymore....lots of TV's...food menu changes constantly....nobody going to pay for anything fancier than empanadas or rice and beans, so I don't even know why they have a chef?  Give it a shot..."}
{"text":"SOOO, apparently you can't come in here with a valid state ID. You have to HAVE a drivers license. So I'm guessing they encourage drinking AND driving. If you're a female you can enter with just an ID. I'm a regular, I tried to come in to Benny's with my boyfriend and best friend but they were not allowed to enter because they are NON drivers. Ridiculous. Never will I come and spend $100+ in this establishment. FUCK this place. Management was extremely rude, they made our group feel like we were criminals. I do not recommend this place EVER."}
