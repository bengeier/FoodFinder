{"text":"This was the best Indian food I've had in a while. I can recommend the saffron chicken. Naan was great. Service was friendly. My lovely waitress chased me down in the rain after I left behind my jacket.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ambiance - comfortable. Server - pleasant and attentive.
Mmmmmmm Food was very authentic, hit the spot. We ordered the fish koliwada for appetizers - they were delicious. For the mains - butter chicken and saag paneer - flavours were just right - 8.5/10 for both. The best part were their soft and fluffy naans. Overall good experience. Def recommended !!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and best friend because we had a voucher I bought online. We just came from skiing so we were famished lol It wasn't too busy for a Saturday night but the place was big and nice decor. The servers were friendly (one of them was the owner who did come over to talk with us).

There is also a downstairs banquet type room for functions. This restaurant is also located in streetsville which is always nice to visit.

The food:

Butter chicken 11.95, was not the best I've ever had but good enough but not enough chicken pieces and my husband had to nicely offer me the last one :D.

Lamb Roganjosh $12.95 was the bext dish that night, spicy, flavorful and just yummy. *drolling a bit right now lol but again not enough meat pieces and a smaller portion.

their naan $2.25-2.75 was yummy, but we had to order a couple extra pieces  because each order only came with a little.

Saag paneer 10.95 (expensive) which was definitely one of the worse ones I've had, we didn't finish it and I packed it because I don't like wasting food, but no one ended up eating it anyways. It was also on the smaller side proportions wise.

Overall the meal was ok, except for the lamb but would go back because it was expensive even with the coupon."}
{"text":"If Nawab isn't a franchise, then it's coordinated by one helluva successful family.  In addition to this location in Mississauga's trendy Streetsville, they're in Thornhill.  And in India, Malaysia, Uganda, and several locations in the UAE.  

Sometimes, when ordering Indian, I suspect that the cooks cater their recipes to the comparatively timid Westerner palate and serve their hotter dishes to what someone in Poona might regard as suitable for toddlers. My chicken hyderabadi (fiery chicken with minced lamb) was very nummers though, and I was only disappointed that the serving was just this side of modest.  

In addition to the vindaloos, roganjosh, kormas, biryanis, the obligatory butter chicken, and other dishes that Westerners have come to expect, Nawab offers some plates that frankly I hadn't seen before.  (Maybe I just haven't been paying attention, or maybe I'm just that habitual in my ordering lamb korma or chicken vindaloo.)  Several prawn and other fish dishes are available here, including Bombay (a \"roadside\" recipe with chili paste, curry leaves and whole coriander), saffron, tawa (griddled prawn with onion, yoghurt and coriander leaves), and an Indian interpretation of Thai green curry.  The palak kofta (spinach dumplings stuffed with cottage cheese in a creamy spinach sauce) looked incredible.  The baigan bharta and baigan bagara (eggplant in tomato, onion, and yoghurt, either smoked and mashed or cubed and fried) would definitely meet my eggplant fix.

Our server was cordial, polite, and attentive.  The tunage was eclectic and unique without seeming overbearing or unpleasantly distracting.  Several wines and lagers make up for the standard booze selections, including beers from India."}
{"text":"I'm going to give these guys another star.

I went in tonight with a friend and we stuck to the veg items that were house specials. It was a good plan.

We started with the vegetable balls and they were outstanding! Next we had the Paneer Tikka and Palak Kofta (that was the name of the spinach dish I'd previously forgotten). Sooooo freaking good!!!

Our waiter was awesome! The modern Indian music over the speakers was funky. Everything was really good... except the bathroom. 

Sad face. When I walked into the ladies room I noticed how big it was and what a nice job they did decorating and putting nice soaps and lotions there. But then... I opened a stall. Eeeek! Closed that and on to the next. Even more gross. All of the toilet stalls were beyond nasty with the exception of the one that's door didn't stay closed. This was quite disappointing. Clearly they made a good effort to create a nice bathroom and patrons are not appreciating it. Nonetheless, perhaps the staff could go down every couple of hours to ensure tonight's state of affairs do not occur."}
{"text":"Have been here 5 times. Nawab Indian Cuisine is officially my favorite Indian restaurant. One of the servers recognized me and my boyfriend, and initiated a conversation to see how we were doing and welcomed us, even though he wasn't our current server. The service is absolutely great. Food is so delicious. Can't get enough of this place! 5 of out 5!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times during weekday lunches and have been impressed with the food so far. Each time I come here, I have the lunch special (thali), which comes with naan, rice, a main meat entree, a main vegetable entree, 2 appetizers, some fruit, and a salad. Very filling and very delicious."}
