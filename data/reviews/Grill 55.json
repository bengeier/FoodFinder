{"text":"I feel for a lunch menu it was a bit over priced even for Vegas standards. I got the blackened fish tacos- talapia, cabbage, salsa, arugula and a tequllia cream sauce. The fish wasnt as seasoned as I expected for it being blackened, but it was good. Make sure to squeeze the lime over it because it brings the flavor out in the sauce. The side of fries were nice and chrispy and my bar service was great. The hostess was not friendly and very unhelpful. Watch the drink prices. they are not listed. An iced tea was $4."}
{"text":"The Artisan Burger with jalapeño bacon is the bomb.  Bartenders are fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Food was really good, a little expensive, wait staff gave you your space but were available when needed.  The table we were sat at was like a large living room coffee table surrounded by sofas, I'm still not sure if this is a regular table of the overflow.  Burger and a beer will set you back about  $30. Ouch."}
{"text":"After arriving in after a long day of travel came in here to grab food and went to sit on the patio...we asked if we needed to be seated and they said no they'd be right out. Waited at least 15 minutes and again went inside to let someone know we were outside. There was 2 tables in the entire restaurant! And 2 bartenders! Walked out because they obviously didn't want our service!"}
{"text":"The Signature 55 Burger is served on a nice, soft bun. While the meat doesn't taste freshly cooked, it's hard to say no to jalapeño bacon. No problem if your phone is dying; they have electrical outlets at your table. So, should you try now? While not the best food in town, it's the closest edible meal near the convention center."}
{"text":"Giving this place a 1 star review is being gracious. A negative -5 stars would be more accurate. After waiting over an hour for tomato soup and grilled cheese we got it cold. We took a bite out of the grilled cheese and it was also cold. So we sent it back. 10 minutes later we got the same bowl and plate, then we realized that the same grilled cheese that we had taken a bite out of was still on the plate. Oh but wait the really horrible deplorable thing is I had the plate that my dining companion had at first. Which means I had the sandwich that she had taken a bite from. GROSS!!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived Friday night  after a long drive from LA and ordered a Chopin martini but they were out of Chopin.  So I asked for Belvedere and they were out of that too.  Geez, Vegas on a Friday night
and they can't keep the bar stocked! Disappointed.  Menu selection much more limited than shown on Yelp."}
{"text":"I think this place had no idea that NAB conferences were starting on Saturday, as service was very slow. Took over 40 minutes to get the Signature Burger ($16), which tasted just ok. Could have had more flavor. The \"side salad\" was just a bunch of lettuce; a disappointment. The only good thing that I can say is that the waitress did comp my meal due to the excessive wait. They did offer local craft beer, but an IPA for $11, ?!?
Overall, I went here to try something different as compared to the convention center fare. Do yourself, and your wallet, a favor. Stick with the convention center which is far faster."}
{"text":"I was momentarily excited to see on the cocktail list an Old Fashioned that was a real OLD Fashioned: no cherry, no orange, no club soda, just  \"Knob Creek, sugar, lemon, Angostura bitters,\" the menu promised. Great! But first he tried to use Jim Beam -- hell no. Then, out came the cherry and orange. Dude, the menu is RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. It only has like 8 cocktails described on it, have you never looked? But wait, there's more: after trying weakly to dissolve a sugar packet into a diluting amount of club soda (why can't bars keep freaking simple syrup on hand?) and putting the bourbon, he asked, \"Do you want bitters? Some people don't like the bitters.\" Well then it's not an Old Fashioned, I pointed out. So he proceeds to dump an OUNCE OF VERMOUTH in it, followed by a few dashes of Angostura. I guess you could call this drink \"Don Draper Crapped in Manhattan.\" So sad. 

But the bar staff sure do put in the effort to be friendly otherwise. Though when I asked about local beers and ordered the local IPA at lunch, it would've been nice had the bartender mentioned it was a 22oz bottle before opening and pouring it for me -- I didn't need that much at bloody lunch. Thanks but no thanks. 

Only 3 beer taps and one is empty. 

The \"Margherita\" flatbread was crispy on the edges and floppy everywhere else, probably because it had tomato sauce all over it, which is what you do NOT do on a pizza Margherita. 

God this Old Fashioned is making me sad."}
{"text":"My friends and I were staying in the Renaissance for a conference. We got back from the strip around 5pm and decided to eat at grill 55. When we arrived we were told 3 different reasons why the restaurant was closed. No one gave us a time frame of when it would be opened or any options to eat. We sat in the lobby for 30min or so and saw 2 women get seated in the restaurant. We went in to see if they were open and they were. I became annoyed that although everyone knew we were waiting no one came to tell us it was open. After we were seated and ordered our meals our waitress came over to let us know that the manager jack would be taking care of our check. 

We were not expecting that at all. We would've been happy with a percentage off our bill and honestly we were expecting nothing. It was great that he acknowledged our feelings and did something about it. 

Also the food was AMAZING! I had the steak sandwich, oh my god delish. And it's not that expensive."}
{"text":"Had some friends staying at the hotel where Grill 55 is located. Decided to sit down for some wine and a little eats. Angie the bartender was not only outgoing and smiling, she really knew her stuff about wine and the food! Service was a 5 star for sure! Food was on point, wine was great, and Angie really made me feel at home. Kudos  I'm a local and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located inside the Renaissance Marriott hotel this place is a good quick stop for small meals and some drinks.  They have a full bar and some televisions at the bar so that you can keep up with the ongoing sporting events, etc.

While we were there it was fairly quiet and sedate in the lounge with very few patrons.  The waitress was quite attentive to us the first time we went in there.  The second night it was the same until we had four friends join us.  I don't think that she liked the extra work of having to come back and see if we needed another round, etc.  

In fact, many times, we went up to the bar ourselves.  She brought us three separate bills throughout the evening.  We were there from about 6pm to 8:30pm.  Nobody had more than four drinks so it wasn't like she was overworked.  I went to the bar to order food.  

i don't know what it was we weren't being loud, etc., and we were about the only ones in the place.  Maybe she likes it better when no one disturbs her.

The place is good but the wait staff (not the bartender there was a guy one night and a girl the other night--both good and friendly).  not so much.

Recommend but with a caveat."}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel so after we checked in we ate a late lunch here. The place was mostly empty so we just chose a seat. To drink I got an iced tea. Our waitress was helpful. I ordered the wedge salad with blue cheese dressing and steak filet cooked medium. 

All our food came at the same time and we didn't have to wait that long for it. My steak was kinda small though, smaller than I expected. It was also more medium rare than medium. It was seasoned well though and I enjoyed it. I ate it all, probably because it was pretty tiny. The salad was good. I liked the blue cheese dressing and the thinly sliced red onions. I also got to try some of my Friend's Mom's sweet potato fries. They were pretty good. Nice and crispy and seasoned well. It was a good lunch, but I left still kinda hungry."}
{"text":"Grill 55 is a great place to relax and recharge. The Renaissance is a non-gaming hotel anyway so the pace is significantly slower, and it's more of a business hotel servicing the Las Vegas Convention Center. So the grill makes a great place to grab a drink, some food and maybe meet some other business people especially if you're in town for a trade show or convention.

I'd say that Grill 55 has a much more interesting menu than most hotel bar/grills. Even standard grill selections like the burger have a unique twist. The Signature 55 Burger, for example, comes with jalapeño bacon and an interesting aioli that I think is garlic aioli but the menu doesn't specify so I can't be 100% sure. They also have an option for truffle fries which are delicious. Tuna poke nachos are really good, and the spicy risotto balls are as well. In fact I don't think I've ever been disappointed with anything I've ordered here.

Service tends to be variable since it all depends on how busy the restaurant is. During lunch hours, which is when I usually go, there is only one server on shift that I could see so it can take a while in some cases to be helped, but the service is very friendly.

Prices tend to be a little high in my opinion, but its Las Vegas so I guess I shouldn't really be surprised. All considered, if you are not pressed for time, Grill 55 is a great choice."}
{"text":"We come in unexpectedly due to needing some place to have lunch & hold a brief work meeting. We also needed it to be ADA friendly & quiet. Unlucky at first we ended up in the pool area outside but then they needed to do some work near our table. The contractor got management involved and with much success we were able to move inside into a private dining room. The service staff & management went well above and out of their way to accommodate us on short notice. Hands down we will return for future business. Thank you!"}
{"text":"An amazingly terrible breakfast buffet, are you even trying? Explains why the restaurant is empty."}
{"text":"We wanted a quick bite to eat after our show ended, so we stopped in for lunch. There was 1 waitress and she was stressed and trying to do everything. We waited 25 minutes to get drinks and order. It took over an hour to get our food. They ended up.having managers and other staff come in to help. As another poster said, they were not prepared for anyone to come in. I ordered the lobster mac and cheese. It was decent, but I didn't find a single piece of lobster in it. It was more like mac and cheese with lobster bisque poured over it. It was overpriced and limited on options, especially for the long wait."}
{"text":"Went here after the CES conference for lunch. Good small bites with a comfortable atmosphere. Although the food was not special it was fresh and tasted good. the \"lobster and friends\" was an interesting snack but not really a lunch or dinner portion.
This place is more of a lounge with appies not a grill. Their flatbread pizzas looked good however. 
I give it a better rating simply because it is the closest thing to a real restaurant near South Hall. Will come back if I'm in Vegas for a conference."}
{"text":"Located inside the Renaissance hotel, half bar half restaurant. Had the combo soup and grilled cheese - yummy roasted tomato basil soup, fresh chunky and delicious, grilled cheese had gouda and grilled to melty yumminess. Good service, varied menu. We missed happy hour, but will check it out later"}
{"text":"Located inside the Renaissance Las Vegas, it's walking distance from the convention center. Perfect location for a quick business lunch. Get the Jalapeño Bacon burger - Delicious!!!! Great relaxing atmosphere to recharge if you're taking a break from the convention."}
{"text":"Went here because the Envy steakhouse wasn't open yet and we were starving. The service was really great. Love how the staff presents themselves! Got the tower of fries as an appetizer, was great. We did have a shift change during our meal and we were left with no refills on our drinks til after our meal but that was our only issue. This place has a very limited selection of food items but the food is very good. Loved the food presentation as well."}
{"text":"Our salads were all fresh and made with darker color greens which I loved.  Some fruit and nuts made it funner to eat.  I had some charred tuna and it was delicious too.  Service is good.  Ambience is business like but was fine for our business lunch."}
{"text":"It is not clear on the menu but the new york is actually a steak sandwich.  A very good and filling steak sandwich that came with a small salad.

The meal salad with meat were expensive for what you got.

Getting seated was early but the service was not very attentive and slow.

Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Good intentions but a little iffy on food and delivery. Went in later (11:15)  and food took 40 minutes to come out with four of us ordering. Fish tacos had good mix and wonderful presentation but fish was not fresh and had that almost bad do I trust smell. Fries were enjoyed by all very heavy on garlic wonderful for the garlic aficionado. Margarita pizza good and garlic with a good balance of spice beyond the garlic unfortunately covered up by a little to much cheese taste. (to much cheese for a flatbread with good intention). Tomato soup and cheese sandwich were pusillanimous sandwich did not live up to the small but well balanced tomato. Atmosphere very nice and staff overworked but accommodating with great toons. This seemed like a non Vegas like place and considering this is a Marriott the day may be better as this has a little Mormon flair inherent in the fabric."}
{"text":"Stopped in for 1 night before heading home while a friend was working in vegas. Natalie at the bar is amazing. She remembered my friend from his last business trip as well as began a personable experience the second we sat down. Coming from a fellow bartender she is amazing!! Definitely stop in when she's working she's a great bartender and makes a killer mojito!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch while at the Las Vegas Convention Center, in the lobby bar area. We had to ask for a replacement for the Truffle Regiano Fries because they were cold when we received them. Though, damn good once we got them! I LOVE them.

Mom got the B.A.T. flatbread, which was super yummy. I picked off the bacon (which is also hidden under the cheese, so be careful) and had a field day. 

I had the Nicoise Salad which was good, and made me feel good about eating the fries. :)

Overall, I would definitely suggest this for some re-fueling when at the Convention Center. Way better than any of the other surrounding options."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch during a convention. The restaurant has a very modern style and is inviting. The staff seemed to be overwhelmed with all the guests. I ordered a salad with steak which was good, but not great. Overall a good place for a quick snack..."}
{"text":"I was trying to get to Envy and all the entrances were blocked off for some reason.  I went in through the patio and thought I found it.  But it was a separate restaurant connected directly to it, which turned out to be this brick restaurant.  Waitress took 20 min to get me a menu and glass of water.  Food was okay but no refill on my water which I drank in first five min for entire visit there.  Took 20 min after I was done for waitress to get me a check.  To be fair she walked really slow."}
{"text":"It's located at the Renaissance Hotel lobby. My boyfriend and I chose the bar and had few drinks and pizza. Margherita was really tasty and super crispy crusted. Impressive. 

There weren't a lot of people on a Friday night so the service was really fast and staff was very friendly and polite. I love that! We have enjoyed watching some basketball, chit chat and went back to our room."}
{"text":"Same great experience every time I go there. Nice atmosphere, great food, nice beer selection and one of the best bartender in town : Romulus!
Usually I order the same food, I've become addicted to their Caesars Salad with Ahi Tuna, can't ask for anything more. The salad is actually fresh every time, I love consistency :) and the tuna is literally melting in your mouth. Pair it with a Sauvignon Blank or a Pinot Grigio 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"The steak sandwich is REALLY GOOD. I was staying at the hotel and reluctantly decided to eat here because I didn't want to go too far.  I'm not sure if I was pretty hungry as well but the sandwich was surprisingly good.  You don't need any utensils for the steak itself.  I've had my fair share of steak sandwiches at other restaurants where I look like an animal trying to bite off a piece.  I had an option for salad, fries, or potato fries to go with my sandwich.

Good stuff.  Can't wait to try the other food items next time."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible restaurant. I ordered a shrimp salad for to-go but there is no shrimp at all. Fortunately I opened the box before I leave. I waited for around half an hour and finally someone came and gave me 5 shrimp. Also the shrimp smells terrible. They are not fresh."}
{"text":"Best bartender EVER. She cares about what she does and how she presents her drinks. Truly a wonderful person to get to know. Very knowledgeable. I wanted a French 75 and she took the time to make it right. She even gave me cool information about other related drinks that I didn't know. The bar also had some great little munchy snacks they offer in cups. They seemed to be strips of fried and flavored tortilla type crisps... Very addictive."}
{"text":"Seeking a place to eat in the hotel we decided to have this restaurant for lunch. While waiting for them to open, I consulted my handy Yelp app for its reviews and menu. The menu here is almost mirrors some of the same features that Envy serves in some ways, Envy is much better! With the Renaissance hotel being so comfortable and having so many wonderful seating areas we decided to eat in the lobby area by the couches when our meal came. The staff of the restaurant is super friendly. Upon first glance of the restaurant the bar area looks so very clean and has such a wide selection of liquor choices. The food on the menu all sounds great too! So many hard choice of what to order.    

Now with the ordering out of the way time to reflect on the pony court and the recent panels we just came from. The waiter that took our order was very busy and his reach of guests and service to them is extensive. Most of those in attendance to Grill 55 today are those from the pony universe. I am so glad that the Pony Con was held here at the Renaissance just for the royal dining choices that one has to select from. 

We finally decided on the Grilled Steak Sandwich for lunch with the onions held. The side that we chose was french fries. We will eat healthy tomorrow. To pair with the steak wine a Riesling I thought would compliment the steak. The Riesling is a Chateau de Michelle and it went perfectly with the steak.

When I finally received my steak sandwich is was so delicious looking and displayed so well on the plate. The steak was so tender that I could pick it up and eat it without having to cut it. The seasonings that were used made the steak so much tastier. The Cheddar was a nice change for a topping too for me, since usually I swing towards the white cheeses such as feta and mozzarella. Deciding to live a little for desert we selected the Toasted Pound Cake. At first mention it has strawberries so I am all in on that. The hand whipped cream was such the cherry on top and a great way to end lunch."}
{"text":"Located in the Renaissance Hotel. Grill 55 offers finger foods, main entrees, sammies, craft beers and designer adult beverages in a modern casual setting.

I ordered the Drunken Grasshopper adult shake - creme  De Menthe, creme de cacao, vanilla ice cream and chocolate malt balls. The shake was unique and satisfying, a nice way to end an evening. 

The menu is really unique here and I'm looking forward to checking out the food next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. A casual bar setting. But food was not great. jalapeño burger that was raved about was very greasy. Had cheesecake for dessert and it was really bad. Fell apart and not sweet. Staff however was extremely personable and very kind. Too bad their kitchen let them down."}
{"text":"Colleague needed to grab a late lunch so we headed on over to Grill 55. Granted, it was during CES, so it was crazier than usual. The 2 of us were seated quickly, despite the crowds.

I wasn't hungry but ordered a glass of Chardonnay and a pretzel for a snack; colleague ordered a beer and steak sandwich. When he place his order he asked for A1 sauce and a side salad and specified the dressing type.

When my wine was brought, it was filled to the very top. I'm not even sure how he carried to me without spilling. I looked like a lush with a glass filled so high. My pretzel was standard. I noticed another table's pretzel was served differently. Don't know why there was difference.

My colleague's meal had quite a few problems. 1. No A1 sauce brought, had to remind server. 2. No dressing on his salad. Had to ask for dressing. 3. Salad was just greens.  No tomatoes, croutons, cheese, etc, just lettuce. 4. Steak sandwich had a huge chunk of fat.

Normally, I would give 2 stars,  but staff was so friendly, I upgraded to 3."}
{"text":"Grill 55 is a little strange - it's a bar attached to the Renaissance Hotel (right near the lobby) near some live music on Fridays and a TV/Envy restaurant.  You wouldn't expect much of it to be honest but surprisingly, it is a pretty interesting/solid restaurant if you're around the area.  

Grill 55 is super casual (although I'd recommend sitting at the bar over a table).  Seat yourself and grab a menu.  The items aren't too numerous and seem pretty safe such as sandwiches and salads.  However, the taste is surprisingly fresh and tasty.  My favorite were the fish tacos which had a surprisingly spicy/tangy sauce in two nicely sized tacos with hot/fresh tasting white fish.  It also came with fries or a salad.  The presentation was also nice to see with the tacos being held up by a stand.  I also had the grilled cheese one night which was also solid (although I wish they heated up the sandwich more to make the cheese completely melt).  The tomato soup it came with was pretty good too.  At the bar, don't forget that you get free spicy wontons (basically little tangy chips).  The drink selection isn't too shabby with a mix of cocktails ($12) to beer/wine ($6+).  They also have happy hour which I was never able to make it down by.  Food items are a little pricey (ranging usually $12+) but in the context of Vegas food, it's not too badly priced.  

Service was fairly friendly and it was nice to have the place open till 1AM so you can grab your late night fix.  Seats were comfy - the AC was on full blast and there is even some music nearby if you come at the right time.  

Again, don't go in with overly ambitious expectations of grandeur compared to the likes of some of the exquisitely designed (and pricey) restaurants of Vegas.  However, for a late night (or earlier) snack, especially near LVH/the LV Convention Center which is devoid of a lot of good food by foot - Grill 55 is a god-send for affordable Vegas eating in the area."}
{"text":"Grill 55 is conveniently located inside the Renaissance Hotel next to the convention center. Like most of the restaurant in the Last Vegas hotels and casinos, the decor is appealing and the atmosphere inviting.

Came here a bit after lunch and ordered some appetizers:

- Old bay calamari $12
- Black bean quesadilla $12
- Chicken crispers (essentially deep-fried chicken strips) $11

They gave us some seasoned tortilla strips/chips to start the meal. The chicken crispers were a bit burnt and the clamari looked good but lacking flavor even with the sauces. The black bean quesadilla was the best of the three."}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I came here for lunch during MAGIC week since it's very conveniently located next door to south hall and the prices are about the same as the convention center choices. As a comparison to eating there this place is much much better, but overall as a restaurant I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to come here.

The food is good, but nothing great. The menu consist of simple cafe style options like burgers, salad and sandwiches. I had the wedge salad with a cup of tomato soup. The salad was good and fresh but the soup was pretty bland and tasted like it was from a can.

Overall a good lunch stop with decent food choices. The service was also good too, very quick and friendly even when it got busy."}
{"text":"Being right next to the convention center, this place was surprisingly not prepared for seemingly ANY business.  The food wasn't prepared as listed on the limited menu, appetizer came out after everyone at the table was 1/2 way through their meals, salads had zero dressing on them and came out with none on the side, and a few more miss-fires. They desperately needed someone to clear the tables too as we noticed tables sitting with tons of plates on them with the server completely tied up trying to wait on many tables. It would otherwise seem like a great quick option to stop in and get some fairly reasonably priced food instead of eating concession food from the convention center, but not today."}
{"text":"Arrived late Friday night and was starving! Too exhausted to go out and I realized that they handled room service. Ordered calamari and shrimp app, Mediterranean salad w/grilled chicken, AND flourless chocolate cake. As you can see they got a FIVE star from me. It did me well knowing if I wanted I could eat that same meal every night if I was too tired to venture. Inhaled it so fast no pics were taken! Best calamari I've ever had!"}
{"text":"A group of us came here for happy hour before we hit up Envy Steakhouse (adjacent to Grill 55 inside the Renaissance Marriott inside).  Friendly bartenders and strong pours.  TVs at the bar have sports playing all the time and the bartenders will also strike up a conversation even if they aren't serving you. A great place to chill out before hitting up the strip."}
{"text":"First time here. Quiet Thursday night, Moscow Mules, Mediterranean Salad, Chicken Quesadilla and great service from\"Kathy\" ( I think I got the name right)!  Drinks and food were served promptly. Nice spot for a late bite without having to go back out in the city!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the chicken sandwich with a salad, and my coworker had the fish tacos. My chicken was dry as possible and they forgot the dressing on my salad. 
My coworker said everything inside the tortilla of his fish taco was good, but the tortilla itself was stale and hard. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Their signature Jalapeño Bacon burger is the thing to get here. It really is good.
The rest of the menu was fairly average."}
{"text":"Food just isn't that good, especially for the price. I had their Caesar salad when I came last year for a work related conference. The chicken was SO dry I could barely eat it. I am back again for the same work related conference and tried their Caesar salad again. BIG mistake. Same disgusting dry chicken. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Formerly envy Lounge, this is a nice hotel bar at the Marriott Renaissance with modern, spacious seating areas, 
They have some unique menu items, such as Fried deviled eggs! 
I also had Lobster & Friends, which is a trio of sliders including BBQ pork and beef.
The lobster portion was the smallest, though it should have been the star of the dish, due to the name Lobster & Friends! The sliders come with either a salad or fries. The salad was served in a small cup, and was only lettuce. I was not too excited about the sliders, and the deviled eggs were pretty good. 
They also have Happy Hour, though the specials were not listed on the bar menus."}
