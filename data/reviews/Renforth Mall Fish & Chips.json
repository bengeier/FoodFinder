{"text":"A great mom & pop run chippy 
Not as greasy as other places.
They are reasonably priced
They offer steamed fish which is a healthier option
Just keep in mind they are closed Mondays"}
{"text":"I went to Renforth F&C this week and got a snap of the family deals.  I had cod and chips for take out at home.  The piece of fish seemed smaller than I thought it should have been and usually cod comes in long pieces but it was cod, just squarish like halibut.  

After tax it was about 10 bucks.  I just thinking of what I got at Codmother in San Francisco for 10 bucks and they have officially ruined me for any other fish and chip place I think (for now).  Renforth is still ok though."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but the service is still fast-paced and the people are really nice. 

Ordering Halibut and poutine was awesome, they arn't chincy with the cheese and dont drown the fries in gravy.. good stuff.  Got exactly what was expected."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was way little. It was always a must have dinner for our family when my sister and I came to Toronto to visit our grandparents. Some times we'd eat in or take it to go. The quality has never changed even though the owners have changed a few times in all my years of eating at this place. It's face service and pretty well always busy, I have never seen the place at dinner time without some kind of line. But I don't frequent as often as I'd like (trying to watch that waist line). It will always be my favourite place to get fish and chips.I have also never really found a place that compares to this one."}
{"text":"Came in to grab some takeout for 2 of us and chose a Halibut & Chips and a Cod & Chips. It was ~$25 for both and, although the pieces of fish seem small, they are tasty. They have a family deal for 4 pieces but halibut for 4 pieces and chips was $50ish which I guess seems good.. The others are $39 I think.. I'd get more fish than necessary because there are a ton of fries there..

I like fish mostly but am always on the fence about which fish to have in my fish&chips. The cod was softer and butterier and meltinyourmouthier. The halibut was firmer and flakier and more oomphier. Take those descriptions as you see fit but I call 'em like I see 'em.

I received mine in a cardboard box wrapped in plain paper with an elastic around it.. It's no greasy newspaper but it'll do. [in reference to another review & styrofoam]

Friendly enough service.
Lots of seats to sit there if that's your thing.
Washrooms down the back hallway 'for customer only' -- you know, I only reference this because it annoys me every time I see a sign like that... Sure, I get it, you pay the water bill, but seriously, I'd drop the sign and allow for the niceties to flow like if someone has to go..  I didn't even go in but I suspect it might be clean [now that I'm typing this I'll go in next time to check]..  I recognize also that it is probably because of students in the area screwing around and making a mess... That is a fair point also..  Anyway, let's try to keep this food-related..

So, in summary, juicy cod, oomphy halibut, get extra fish because small pieces.."}
