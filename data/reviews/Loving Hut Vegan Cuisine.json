{"text":"I love having a vegan restaurant in the west valley! This place did not disappoint, it was amazing!!! I got the Texas BBQ wrap and my husband had the burger. We can't wait to come back many more times."}
{"text":"I'm still processing the bizarre experience I had here. First time visitor. The dish I ordered was not prepared correctly... it seemed like someone had cleaned the inside remains of a pan out into a bed of iceberg lettuce- all carbonized small bits of onion and green pepper topped with over salted deep fried protein. I tried two bites but I knew it would make me sick so I took it to the waitress to alert her that it wasn't properly made. She insisted that his is exactly how the dish is supposed to be and- to be honest- I told her that if that was so, then it was disgusting. I probably shouldnt have been so sarcastic and I should have just left it at that, but then she turned around and gave it to a group of young women telling them that \"the lady over there hadn't eaten more than a bite.\" That seemed like a weird business practice so when we left, I asked for the manager.  I told him that rather than just give a dish that was the subject of complaint away, maybe he could check and see what was exactly wrong with it or ask if I needed a remedy. He just shrugged his shoulders... and then another woman appears from behind the counter and told me that I was rude and needed to leave. So I left. I'm still puzzled.  I will say something nice though: the restaurant is very clean and the young man who took my order was nice. But the rest....eeeew."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently switched over to vegan....and very skeptical because he's a meat and potatoes guy (all his life)....last night this place was nothing short of AMAZING! We both had the #1 (\"spring rolls\")....very tasty! We also had the entrees of #41 and #43 (mongolian \"beef\" and \"chicken\" sweet & sour)...couldn't even tell the difference in taste/texture....will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I would come back here every day if I could!! The vegan food here, taste better than any traditional \"non-vegan\" I've had. Full of flavor! Huge portions! Absolutely delicious. I had the soy-beef....juicy, tender, and my husband (who is a meat addict) couldn't even tell the difference! I'm dying to go back!! The hibiscus tea was lovely!! The pad-Thai was nice and spicy. The wontons and golden rolls are absolutely addictive! Thank you for coming into my life LOVING HUT! I love you!"}
{"text":"I went there with my friend for dinner. 
The atmosphere was peaceful and pleasant. The servers were speaking softly and with kindness. This is something I appreciate. The food we had was well presented and colourful. Attractive to the eye.
As a starter we had the spring rolls made with cabbage and carrots and a sweet and sour dipping sauce. I loved this little starter. As main we had the  loaded barbecue  bowl with vermicelli . This includes Vietnamese rice noodles, lettuce, cucumbers,  Vietnamese pickles, vegan beef. The vegan beef is seasoned with barbecue sauce and raw peanuts. The beef tasted really as if it was barbecued and the texture was very similar to eating real beef. The whole dish was a good balance of flavours and crunchiness. I felt I was eating a real Chinese beef stir fry. At the end of this dish, I was already full. My senses were satisfied. Even though at this point I was full, I tried the carrot cake!  Yum Yum !"}
{"text":"This is on of my favorite Vegan cuisine in town.  So good that you wouldn't realize it was vegan.   If anyone is looking for delicious and healthy alternative for lunch, Loving Hut is worth a try! :) 

Don't skip the dessert!  Their pandan cake, is my favorite!  So refreshing green hue like green tea."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place today but ended up very disappointed. I ordered the salad with grilled vegetable protein and it was terrible, not seasoned, nor grilled. Also I paid 8.85 for the salad plus, $1.50 for the avocado and $1.50 for the Vegan cheese to get a box of iceberg lettuce. How can this be a vegetarian spot serving lettuce with absolutely no nutritional value? The $1.79 side garden salad at Wendy's at least uses spring mix lettuce. Let me also say that every signal table had used dishes on them and no one was there eating. They need to hire more help!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They are so friendly and the food is amazing. Looking forward to my next visit and trying something new. I had ordered two fried rice, the basil Thai and the blissful fried rice. One with the brownies and the other with the grilled \"chicken\" option. Both were the best tasting vegan \"meat\" I've tasted!"}
{"text":"Great food, great cause without a doubt but Great service provided in a timely manner? I think not, management needs to hire more help."}
{"text":"I am still in doubt sometimes of becoming vegan but once i come here i just can't help it it is delicious specially the spicy cha cha"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My came here looking for good vegan food and we found it! The service was friendly and the wait was not too bad (about 20 mins) even though they were crowded at 7:30pm on a Sunday."}
{"text":"The divine curry here is wonderful - perfectly spicy and smooth with lots of vegetables and noodles.  Couldn't resist dessert.  The flan and chocolate cake were both amazing!  We'll definitely be back to this little neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Crispy Chickless is delicious. First time eating here and we will definitely be back. Even our non-vegan coworker enjoyed the \"chicken\" burger and baked cheesecake. In fact that baked cheesecake tastes better than regular!!! You must try."}
{"text":"I think that this restaurant does a nice job of offering a variety of vegan dishes.  I recommend the chicken finger appetizer and mongolian beef.  I am not vegan, but I do follow a pescetarian diet.  My husband eats meat.  We have been to this location twice and have enjoyed it on both occasions.  If you are a meat eater, you of course cannot expect it to be identical to eating actual chicken or beef.  However, it is still very tasty."}
{"text":"Words can not express how calming the atmosphere is, how friendly the staff is and how DELICIOUS the food is! One of the owners (I assume) saw me looking at the wall of famous Vegans and engaged in such an inspirational conversation about how  being a Vegan is sooooo healthy. She was not pushy, or preachy. Very sincere and passionate! This is my go-to spot and I'm not even Vegan!"}
{"text":"Was excited to see a \"plant based\" (I'm not Vegan) restaurant in the area so we gave it a try. Food was pretty good but we chose the wrong thing. Should have went for one of the tasty looking veggie dishes which we seen our neighbors eating next to us. We both had Pho and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't nearly as good as the real beef Pho we have at the vietnamese restaurants.

We'll definitely be back and try more on the menu. I hope people support this place."}
{"text":"Loving hut has really good food no complaints. When it comes to customer service on the other hand horrible it can take literally 45 minutes to get to order if they are busy. If you call in your order they will tell you 30 minutes it always takes them way more than 30 minutes even up to a hour for you to get your food thats crazy if you expect to wait that long."}
{"text":"I've never had such a terrible experience at a place that I had such high hopes for. I was extremely happy to find a vegan restaurant near me and when I ordered with a man and I asked him for \"save the curry\" with a side of brown rice, spring rolls and a smoothie with strawberry and mango. When my rolls came out they were great but later when my curry came out it wasn't at all what I expected it was a plate of fried rice with appeared to be some sort of chicken-like topping.  The lady who served me said it was her second day and she didn't take the order so I would have to talk to the person in charge, the man I originally ordered from. He said that's what he understood I ordered so it's not his fault. I told him I wasn't blaming anyone it's just not what I wanted and if he could just make me what I wanted, I brought up the picture of the menu and showed them what I wanted, he said no I had to eat what they brought me or pay for a new order. I said I hadn't even touched the food and didn't want it he said \"oh well, that's not fair to make us make you food again you already have food there nothing wrong with it\". I told him to just give me my money back then and he refused. He said no I'm not because there's nothing wrong with the food just go sit down and eat it! I said no it's not what I wanted or ordered and I have to go find somewhere to eat now and to please return my money. He attempted to repeatedly argue and treat me like a child and began to raise his voice in front of everyone. I didn't want to cause more of a seen but I actually did need my money so I stayed there until he finally agreed to return my money and said to never come back to the restaurant again. Which is when I asked for his name and he said it was Harry and he was in charge and never wanted me there again and started to yell at me. But I was just humiliated at how he treated me, wasn't able to taste their food but I can at least tell you the man in charge is a terrible person who lacks respect."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! We have been in a few times now and so good! I love there Mongolian beef with veggies and there Thai tea is so delish!  I would defiantly recommend this place to anyone and love that all the food is healthy and non gmo!"}
{"text":"If you are health & fitness conscience you will love the Loving Hut. Friendly staff that's very attentive to the Customer. I reccomendation Living Hut to all my Vegan and Vegetarian friends."}
{"text":"Delish & fresh healthy, vegan restaurant in the West Valley.

Cute, vegan restaurant tucked in a strip mall. The inside is bright & cheery.

You can order online, take away or eat in. Super convenient. 

I order the golden nuggest, BBQ cheeseburger & cake slice. Service is pretty quick and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Is the food good? Yes, I'm very satisfied with my first experience there. Tastes good, big portions. 

I ordered the 'brownie' gyro. Turns out, 'brownie' (the type of protein) is a brisket textured meat-substitute glazed with a tangy, mild BBQ sauce. The order also comes with one of three sides, and I chose the fries (came out hot and unsalted, with a dish of ketchup). The greens that are also in the Gyro are dressed and taste good as well. 

But is the gyro authentic? No. But, the menu is huge and I can imagine why the gyro is composed the way it is. 

I also had a Thai Iced Tea. It had too much soy milk for my taste, making the Tea underneath it harder to enjoy. It came premixed, so one probably couldn't get the tea without the soy milk."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible business practice will never return here after not getting a refund on food that took 45 minutes and I never received it the cashier should be fired her customer service is very very unprofessional I will be passing on this information to all my Facebook friends and everyone I know they will not be in business for long!!! I wish there was a box for zero stars to check"}
{"text":"There aren't many restaurants that cater to Vegans in the area. I was excited to find this place. The  food was amazing! They provide excellent customer service too. It's a win win situation."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you are vegan and gluten free! They have so many options to choose from and each one is flavorful and delicious. I had the curry fried rice with \"chicken\" my husband had the basil fried rice with \"beef\" my son had the \"chicken\" nuggets and then we had salad rolls and sushi to split. My favorite thing was the salad rolls but everything else was equally as delicious! They give you large portions with lots of vegetables. We also ordered Thai iced teas and they were probably the best Thai iced teas that we have ever had! The staff is super nice and they go above and beyond to make your experience great! We went at a really busy time and were expecting to have to wait a while for our food but they were very proficient and we received our food in a timely manner. I would highly recommend this place even if you are not vegan or gluten free or soy free. This is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Omg so good! We need more places like this in the far West Valley. Small place, bright, super clean, very friendly staff! The food is amazing. Mainly Asian Vegan, but other options as well. Very well executed. If you want to see places like this make it in the West Valley, please come support them! This is a short bike ride from my house... Would love to see this place thrive!"}
{"text":"So happy to see a vegan restaurant here on the west side.  We come from 83rd & Bell to eat here.  This is our second of many future meals here. No meat, no gmo & yet organically delicious!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Ever since my husband and I found this place we have gone at least three times a month! When we first transitioned into being a vegan we tried the \"weekly meals\" and LOVED it! The people that work that are all so kind and the place is so clean. Every time we go in we love to try something different on the menu and we are not disappointed. 


Favorites: Fabulous Pho, Pad Thai, Loving Hut burger"}
{"text":"I would've rated this place 5 stars but recently my order was wrong and I asked the guy that if I could change it and he told me no that it would be a problem. So the next morning I called to speak with an manager and they told me that they were busy and to call back later.  The overall customer service experience sucks at the litchfield location."}
{"text":"Great place to find yummy vegan food! There is a variety of different cusines to choose from, so it's great for everyone!"}
{"text":"Small portions and very expensive. I paid almost $20 dlrs and still hungry."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the west valley to eat at. The flavors are so vibrant and tasty. The people that work here are so friendly and helpful. If you have a question they take the time to explain and give suggestions. 
Even if you arent vegan, you have to try it out. You will be pleasantly surprised!!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time going to Loving Hut in Litchfield Park and I was blown away by how good the food is, how great the customer service is, and how well priced everything is. I'm not vegan, but I try to do my best in substituting things when I can and make better conscious choices about what I eat, but I truly feel if there were more restaurant like this, it would help end some of the \"stigma\" of being vegan or vegetarian because so many people are so ignorant to it. This proves that vegan food is flavorful, wonderful, and a really realistic substitute for meat when cooked right. I cannot wait to go back again and try more, and I hope this can show people that not only is being vegan beneficial for the planet, but also that vegan food is amazingly good too!"}
{"text":"First time ever in a vegan establishment; wow was I impressed. I had the Mongolian wonder which was very tasty. My wife shared stop her veggie rice which made the flavors just come together. Place was a little busy and somewhat seemed like they were short handed. A little disorganized, girl running register was also bringing food out. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the most upsetting dining experiences I've ever had. I went there about a month or so ago. Now the one guy who originally rang me up answered all my questions and was very sweet. I've never been to this location before, I know each location has different menus so I wanted to know exactly what I was ordering. A young girl I'm assuming is new was wiping a table down and when she was done I asked for her help which automatically annoyed here. I asked her what the house burger is like, she just stared at me. I said ok well is it like a beef type situation? Her response was, \"yes it's like a beef type situation\" and then left. (I've been vegan for seven years, veggie burgers are made with a variety of ingredients that can taste very different from the next so I think that was a logical question to ask.) I ordered the chicken \"wings\" which was average and got the loving hut burger and fries. They give a very small cup for ketchup, I saw a ketchup bottle in the fridge next to me which maybe I should of asked first but when I went to get it, the girl started yelling in front of everyone \"no, no, you can't do that!!!\" I apologized and asked her if I could get some more ketchup. She told me it was 75 extra for sauce. Now here's where I'm just heated because not only has she had an attitude from the start, has been completely unhelpful, just yelled at me in front of customers, now they want to charge me extra for KETCHUP. I've never been to any restaurants including other Loving Huts where they charge extra for this. I honestly rarely get in confrontations with people in customer service but I asked for a manager. No manager ever came out, instead the girl came back with extra ketchup. When she took my app plate, she even added \"you even get to keep your other side of ketchup\". So now with her snarky comment I asked her why she had an attitude with me. I told her from the moment I asked her about something on the menu she was rude to me, in which her response was \"I've just been really busy\". I told her I've served for over ten years and I'd never tell a customer the reason I'm being rude is because I'm busy. I immediately asked for to go containers and as I was opening the door to leave she ran up to \"open the door for me\" I'm assuming to have the \"last word\"....the burger was cold when served, super dry, and the fries tasted old and freezer burned. I spent $25 dollars on a meal that came with some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I really never have a need to go to this location again and the location in Tempe is next to perfect. Wow."}
{"text":"If you're trying to be vegan, this place is really incredible! I've loved everything I've ordered on multiple visits."}
{"text":"Like the ambient, super clean. I ordered Fabulous Pho, the soup is on point and almost as good as the real one. My wife ordered the Beijing fried rice, great flavor too. Would definitely come back to try more stuff. Only draw back is the Groupon voucher only applicable  for Monday - Thursday. But all items are reasonably priced, even without Groupon is still very affordable."}
{"text":"Never ate in a Vegan restaurant until now & this is a winner! I'm hooked on Vegan because of this place. I had their Vegan Mongolian Beef was so delicious I wish I had the recipe! My Vegan friend also liked their dish which looked like breaded shrimp but was ohh so good. The restaurant was clean & cheery with  plenty of free parking. My advice: TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this location put since we had a groupon. The spring rolls and thai curry was delicious. My companion ordered  the sweet and sour and didn't  enjoy the overwhelmingly  sweet flavor. It had more pineapples than tofu. We also ordered the cheesecake and red velvet. Unfortunately, later they told us the cheesecake was not available  but the red velvet was really good! Will certainly come back."}
{"text":"The food is good and the portions are rather full. You will need to wait if you decided not to call in and order. They do offer online ordering and that was easy to use. This will be my vegan spot until I
find something better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite vegan restaurant. They offer a large variety of options and at reasonable prices. Some of my favorites are the Pad Thai and Guru Fried Rice, and the western burger. Definitely recommend this place-whether you're a vegan or not!"}
{"text":"Very good pho and I had the lunch special..Mongolian (un)beef and was also really good..portions leave a little too be desired but that's my gluttonous American culture coming out..a bit on the pricey side but quality ingredients and good food create that balance..keep in mind, I love and easy meat on the daily"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food!  The portions are a good size and the flavors are fabulous!  I have been here several times now with friends.  None of us are vegan. 
We do plan to go often.  We want to make sure that we try everything on the menu.  
The downside?  Service is absolutely horrible.  It is always the same server, possibly the only one, and she is not improving one bit.  It is also very strange/odd that if you order coffee, you have to pay extra to get \"creamer.\"  This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"My favorite Vegan spot in all of AZ, everything I've ordered is delicious, the fried rice and royal noodle soup is super tasty. This place is also very affordable, most dishes are priced at $10 and under."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with this location. Given, the employees might be new, but they had almost no product knowledge and couldn't tell me what was in most of the dishes. Additionally, I waited upwards of twenty minutes for my entree (a to-go order). It wasn't too busy, and after waiting, they brought my meal out on a plate to eat in-house. After explaining that I ordered my meal to go, they continued to bring my appetizer and coffee as if I were eating there. I politely reminded them again that my order was to go. 

On the plus side, their food never disappoints. I wasn't impressed with their won ton appetizer, but my coffee and entree were on point. I would return to try their service again, since I went when this location was new."}
{"text":"Yum! We had dinner here and ordered sushi ,Mongolian  dish , soup , flan and cheesecake. I'm on an allergy free diet so I had many options :) and felt guilt free eating.. people are nice too there will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love this place. The food is excellent. I am craving it now! Great veg choices throughout the menu"}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood restaurant. We go here once or twice a week. We love the pho and the spicy cha cha!"}
{"text":"So I'm not vegan.  But I do enjoy meat-free meals.  That being said, I am not a huge fan of meat substitutes and they are plentiful here.  I wanted to try this place because the reviews are really good.

Well, it was ok.  The flavors are good, don't get me wrong.  But like I said, the meat substitutes are not....in my book.  The pad Thai was spicy and good but couldn't stomach the tofu.  I am generally someone who actually doesn't mind tofu, but this was fried into a chewy and unappealing texture.  Per the reviews I decided to order my daughter the sweet and sour delight.  But it tasted nothing like chicken, neither her or I could stomach it.  The sauce and veggies were good but they charge extra for rice.

All in all I see the appeal for someone who is strictly vegan.  I am glad I tried it but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wide variety of great tasting vegan menu options, quick service (usually), and friendly staff:  Perfect!

The desserts are simply spectacular--how do they do it?!?

Highly recommended.

Visit and you'll be impressed!"}
{"text":"Yay! A vegan place in the West Valley! We thought the good here was better than the Glendale location. The Mongolian wonder dish was  very good. The fresh spring rolls were good too! Our kids enjoyed the sweet and sour dish. The staff were very friendly. We will be back soon and often!"}
{"text":"We have tried this restaurant many times and it never fails. We are not vegans yet but are considering embrassing the diet change. This is a good place to go try vegan / Asian infusion."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.. first time I was in i had to wait 10 min to be acknowledged. Today 2nd time in I walk in and the man sitting down states that they are \"closed until 5\" 0.o - I should mention it is 4:55pm - Any how...."}
{"text":"If you're in the area and want vegan food this is the place to go. I've gotten a couple things off there menu but by far my favorite was the chickless burger with cheese and avocado. The cheese was so good."}
{"text":"My family and I have been huge fans of the Loving Hut for many years now and although we live in the West valley, we've always driven to the 36th st and Indian School location because yes, it's THAT good. We are so happy that they finally made it out west and have some of our favorites here as well such as the Spicy Cha Cha and awesome fried rice options. We tried their BBQ Rolls and they were to die for!!! They have amazing burgers and desserts too. Being vegan, we know how hard it is to find great dining options on the west side so we're truly delighted that the Loving Hut is sooo close to home now!"}
{"text":"I left this review on their Facebook page: 

\"The menu says that you can add additional veggies to the menu, but when we tried to order the noble broccoli, add carrots, no onions... The man from the kitchen came out and told us no, that he would not do that. His reasoning was that it is a traditional Mongolian dish and that's how Mongolian people eat it.

I'm a big supporter of Loving Hut restaurants, especially the one in Glendale. I was so happy to see one closer to home in Litchfield Park. It seems the management of this location has a lot to learn about customer service. How in the world do you not allow additional vegetables in the dish?

Very disappointing.\"

**** Loving Hut replied by essentially calling me a liar: ****

\"Dear Josh Kampmeier. Thank you for coming to Loving Hut Litchfield Park. We respect your point of view... it would be fair to speak the WHOLE TRUTH and HONESTY. You came during the RUSH HOUR. We have so many tickets in front of you and you asked to take out all onions and replace with carrots in a traditional Mongolian dish without paying the customization. Typically we cook as customers requested when time is permitted but you came during the rush hour and this particular Mongolian dish, the onions are the main ingredient to make the flavor like the way Mongolian people eat. If we do, It would become a carrot vegan beef dish instead of a traditional Mongolian dish. We explained it to you that it wouldn't be as good to change all the characters of a traditional Mongolian dish. We hope that you understand our point of view. Thank you.\"

**** Here is my reply to that:****

\"Wow. Now you are calling me a liar. Let's talk about TRUTH and HONESTY:

1.) No, we did not come during \"RUSH HOUR with many tickets ahead of us.\" We were waiting in the parking for you to open at 5pm. We were the 2nd customers through the door. I wouldn't think 2 orders ahead of mine would be considered rush hour.

2.) I had absolutely no problem at all paying an upcharge to add the carrots and remove the onions. You wouldn't give us that option. It was a straight up, \"No, I can't do that because that's not how Mongolian people eat it. It wouldn't be as good.\" You should let your customers determine what they think tastes good. Not everyone likes the same thing.

3.) The dish is called Noble Broccoli. The broccoli is the main ingredient. Broccoli and carrots is an extremely popular dish and while I can appreciate the traditional Mongolian recipe, I didn't come to Loving Hut to get Mongolian food. I came there to get vegan food. I would imagine that the traditional Mongolian dish is also made with cow beef, rather than soy beef.

I truly hope that you can accept my criticism as a way to become better. I don't post this to disparage your restaurant. As I mentioned, I am a long-time fan of the Loving Hut chains. As a client services manager myself, it is important to know where our company needs to improve. If I called my customer a liar every time they reported a problem, I wouldn't have my customers for very long.\"

There have been multiple replies to the review on their Facebook page if you are interested in checking it out. These guys are completely unprofessional and have no relation to the Loving Hut brand other than paying the franchise fee. Save yourself the trouble and go to the Glendale location."}
{"text":"Delicious, nutritious, and clean as can be! The great thing about this place is even if you're not vegan- you can enjoy anything on the menu. You probably won't even notice the difference other than you'll feel energized and satisfied after a meal here.
I recommend the curry and I love the avocado boba! Yummy yummy"}
{"text":"A Cool Hidden Gem of Vegan Goodness, No Service. 

I found this place with a Groupon and stopped in and had some great food! 

Ordering takes A LONG TIME when only 1 person is in front of you. The people trying to order were lost and took about 20 minutes as we stood there pondering leaving. 

The food ended up being outstanding! I'm glad we stopped in. 

Location is way out in the west valley so regular visits won't be happening from us. 

On the way out I tried to buy the meat substitute packages to go but again there were some slow people trying to 20 minute the ordering process. I tried to just leave cash and a little extra and leave but the young cashier said no and to wait my turn so I left. 

Service could use some serious makeover. I would have 4 stared this place if the service as better."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight. I placed an order online on my phone for pick up. Their website and ordering was user friendly and quick. When I shows up 10-15 minutes later, it was super hot and ready.  The man and woman that works in there are kind and we're happy to serve me. I got the spicy pad thai and the spring rolls. It was DELICIOUS.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love their food and really do recommend this place. Everything I've had is delicious, and their large menu is impressive. Plus, it's vegan. More vegan restaurants, especially on the west side of the valley, are needed.

But why do they brag on their menu about being willing to add protein, veggies, etc. to dishes yet are actually unwilling to actually do so? I tried to substitute tofu for the soy protein in the Noble Broccoli because I like it better that way. The cashier had no idea if this was possible, so she asked a man in the back (I think he owns the place--I see him there all the time, and he was previously nearly unwilling to take out onions and add carrots to the same dish but did allow it that time). The man said no, so the cashier came back and said that's not possible. If I'd been gluten-free, would that have been possible?

Anyway, then I asked I could just replace onions with carrots, but again, she didn't know, so she went in the back to ask. And again, she came back saying no, so the man came out that time too and explained to me that this dish is the traditional Mongolian preparation, so they don't want to switch anything out. I told him that he's done it for me before, and he said that maybe he did then, but they don't want to now. It didn't matter if I had allergies--it was just a straight-up no.

Needless to say, I was not impressed at all. I certainly don't want to trash a vegan restaurant in a review because the world needs more vegan restaurants, but be prepared to be unable to eat a meal the way you'd like it made."}
{"text":"The place was nice and clean and the food was on point light and not heavy feeling.  My hubby ordered the fabulous pho and I ordered the tofu deluxe which were good food choices."}
{"text":"Don't bother going to this location. They charge you for extra stuff that's suppose to come with the meal and the recipes always taste off. I ordered the spicy king pao and it came out with only onions,  dried carrots and few pieces of tofu which tasted old and terrible. Mind you I have worked in the food industry since I was 15. So obviously I ask for something else and she said let me talk to the chef and when she came back she said I would have to buy something else if I don't want it. I just laughed in disbelief and took the 10 dollar plate of food. Continued to nibble on it and I ended up getting sick immediately and we had to leave. Do your self a favor and go somewhere else. I will never ever be back."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch, glad to see more healthy options on the West side. Ordered Tofu Deluxe and Fabulous Pho. Never eaten soy protein before and surprisingly it tasted pretty good. The broth was also tasty, I didn't miss that bone meaty broth taste. The tofu dish was also good and pretty simple dish. A bit pricey for the portions. Will be back here to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I'm always up for some vegan/vegetarian food. I've heard good things about Loving Hut and decided to give it try. The food for sure did not disappoint! I enjoyed their salt and pepper tofu, fried rice, and their chocolate cake was alright. I think their chocolate frosting was too sweet. 

Their food presentation was attractive to the eye and their sitting area was well spread out. If there was near me, I think I would come here everyday!"}
{"text":"After asking what all the different \"meats\" were they had I got the spicy pad Thai and yum!! Definitely recommend this place. Nice to have something different around here!"}
{"text":"Omg I haven't had a thai tea since going Vegan and this hits the spot! The kung poa and the mongolian and vegetables were amazing so grateful for a vegan spot in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I loved it! So nice to have a vegan place on the west side. Had the amazing sauté and it was perfectly sautéed and seasoned. My boyfriend is a meat-eater and he had the Greek beefless gyro and he really liked it. The seating arrangement is a little weird though because you order at the counter and get your own water, and I only didn't tip because they don't take your order or check on you like a usual server would. But everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have a Loving Hut closer to my home! This new location did not disappoint. The sweet and sour and Mongolian dishes were really great. Large portions and delicious sauces. The golden roll appetizer was perfect as well. My non-vegan husband really enjoyed his food and we both left full and happy. Even took red velvet cake to go:)"}
{"text":"The Mongolian dish was awesome! Fast, clean and courteous service. I also had the Thai tea which was delicious too! First time eating Vegan, great experience."}
{"text":"Best restaurant around if you are eating vegan. Tons of options and they cater to almost all allergies as well. Prices can be a little high but for what you get it's worth it."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars, as I'm a frequent happy customer, but today was not great.  I ordered the spicy kung pao with flat rice noodles to-go over the phone.  The young man on the phone clearly doesn't know the protocol of the restaurant and what they can and cannot add to dishes, but I didn't find that out until I arrived.  

I go to pick up my order and low and behold, the flat rice noodles were not in my bag.  I was informed about this before paying and receiving my food, but of course I had to ask.  He said the flat rice noodles clump up in the to-go container, but I told him I ordered it that everything would be tossed together, not on the side .  

I was told by Harry, the owner or manager that it would be $10  extra to add those in because they have to be cooked.  So i asked for the thin rice noodles, but for those to be tossed with my kung pao.  This man tried to charge me $5 for it to be tossed, as if the cook had not already made my food, which was cold on the counter by now.  I told him to take it off and just put the cold noodles in my bag.  

The kicker is, for my inconvenience, they didn't even offer me anything. A 9 month pregnant woman. Not a drink or anything.  And I was not told sorry for the inconvenience or thank you come again by Harry who handed me my order. This restaurant won't be seeing my dollar for quite some time. And by what i just ate, the quality of this food is something I could easily make at home for less money, smh"}
{"text":"Yum! My goal is to try everything on the menu at least once.  I highly recommend the Pho (pronounced Fuh). This is my go-to on a cold day or if I think I'm coming down with something. I love the WonTons but not as much as the Spring Rolls, the Golden Nuggets are just like chicken nuggets and are a great choice for kids. Mongolian Wonder is just that a wonder!  Golden Beauty was chewy chicken like dish, this dish would be best served with something on the side besides lettuce. You can't go wrong with the Loving Hut patty as a sub for a hamburger, my next try is that Happy Crispy which was served near me and looked like a thick chicken sandwich. Two sisters have worked each time we've gone, always polite & helpful. We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"The staff and people here are very friendly and welcoming but not in an overwhelming way. I ordered steamed veggies and golden nuggets, both of which were yummy. I also like that I can eat here and pay guilt free. I know their food is good for me, even better for the animals and the planet. They are sustainable as they don't automatically hand out extra like sauce and water which really cuts down on waste and pollution. Even their to-go bags are eco-friendly. Vegan is the way to go and it sure is delicious! I will definitely be returning and inviting others to join."}
{"text":"Loving Loving Hut. So glad to have this gem of an eatery around the corner. The food is made to order and is said to be 100% vegan (they even have a sign asking not to bring in outside food in order to maintain the vegan integrity).  I've tried the Mongolian,  Vermicelli, Sweet and Sour, Happy Crispy Burger, Boba tea, and Carrot cake. EVERYTHING has been tasty and enjoyable.  The carrot cake is amazing!  This a definite place to become a regular. Only draw back is there is a 5% surcharge for to go orders, but hey, so what, enjoy the opportunity to have a seat and eat in!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We ordered the Spicy Kung Pao (\"chicken\"), Spicy Cha Cha (\"shrimp), the brown rice with Thai basil and the Golden Strips (\"chicken\"). It was all very good. I didn't expect the rice to be as delicious as it was. Service was fast and they were friendly. Great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for vegan dining! Clean, tasty, delicious and superb service! My wife and I have been hoping that more vegan options were available in Avondale and we were extremely pleased with the Loving Hut. For vegans or carnivores alike, their food is the best, fresh and full of flavor. We'll be coming back for more soon enough!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! I'm so happy that there is a vegan restaurant on the west side as they're all mostly located in central Phoenix. They're all so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"First time here and loved it! Had the Golden Wontons and Pho which were both delicious. The dipping sauce that came with the wontons was sooo good. Mock beef in Pho was good, i was pleasantly surprised. The soup was HUGE! The hibiscus tea was freakin amazing! (Wished they offered a discounted rate for refills or something since they dont do free refills) I will definitely be back to this place. Coming here makes transitioning to Vegan easy!!!

P.S. \"Grandma\" was in the kitchen cooking so you know the food is good!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here at the recommendation of family.  Loved the vibe and the food. Service was good and the menu made you want to come back to try everything."}
{"text":"Dream come true! So happy to have a vegan restaurant in this bland chain restaurant packed area. Love the freshness and variety here. I always get the fresh carrot apple juice and a slice of carrot cake. The burgers, soups, and spring rolls are my top choices. Friendly, great customer service and guilt-free vegan good. A welcome haven for vegans like me and a great change of pace for carnivores or health/earth conscience folks looking to eat a healthy feel-good meal. Seriously try this place out, it proves vegan food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm an omnivore through and through, but love to indulge in vegan cuisine from time to time. No matter how carnivorous you are, something about a light, plant-based meal can really hit the spot. 

Tucked into a plaza is a region sorely needing some variety, Loving Hut has reached Litchfield Park to meet all your fast-casual vegan needs. It's basically Chinese-American food, but with high quality meat substitutes as well as veggie dishes that really won't break the bank. 

I absolutely enjoyed the Mongolian Wonder and will fight the urge to not just order the same thing every time. I also liked the sweet and sour 'chicken' dish. Good stuff. I finished it all off with a glass of fresh carrot-apple juice, which I believe had some ginger added as well. This was a quality meal overall, and I'd go out of my way to visit again. 

I think what sticks with me the most was both the service, which was courteous and informative, and the vision of the business itself. They're really into advocacy for a vegan lifestyle because of the environmental as well as health benefits. They're not into being trendy or holier-than-thou like I've seen from other vegan spots, but just genuinely trying to make the world a tasty and more friendly place. 

If you're reading this, just think about the energy and water you'll save by going meatless for one lunch. Like, don't think I'm trying to convince you to change your life, because I won't, but it wouldn't hurt if we all did it every once in a while. Also, this food is bomb AF so really what do you have to lose?"}
{"text":"A must go too. Plenty of options to choose from! Super friendly and helpful staff of you are a new Comer!"}
{"text":"UNSATISFIED!-STILL HUNGRY!-HUGE DENT IN MY WALLET!

So disappointed that I'm litterally leaving this review in the store as I'm eating.

This place plays 100% into the stereo type of \"arm and a leg to be vegan\" and I also think they take advantage of being \"the only vegan place in the west valley\".

Me and my girlfriend came here and looked at the menu, anytime you asked if it \"came with anything\" we were met with \"that's going to be extra.\" We both ordered the \"Tofu Deluxe\", it's literally tofu and fried diced onion.. that's it. If you wanted to actually have something with it, like oh I don't know, a bed of rice like most places that offer similar dishes, it was extra. We opted to not get the rice because it was already exspensive as it was. And when she took the order she was surprised that we didn't get the rice? I'm not going to pay more for something it should have came with.

We also ordered the BBQ rolls as a starter. Her food and the appetizer all came out at one time, defeating the purpose of a \"starter\". The bbq rolls were the size of my finger. Very underwhelming and overpriced. The picture of course makes it look a lot bigger, like one you would get at a Vietnamese place  They brought my girlfriends food and the appetizer all at once but I didn't get mine. I saw people who were coming in after me, getting their food before me. When mine finally arrived it wasn't even seasoned. Just fried tofu with fried onions. Oily, unhealthy, flavorless, unsatisfying, and I'm still hungry. The portion is seriously a joke. 

With the tip included I spent $38. Thats a lot of money for two people to basically share a block of tofu, both with no rice. Litterally just unseasoned, fried, oily tofu with oily burnt onion. I blame myself for eating it and not just asking for a refund when I saw what was delivered to my table. I will never come here again, it's litterally a scam that plays into the \"if you want to eat vegan you have to pay more because vegan Ingredients cost more.\" Just completely disappointed."}
{"text":"The location is great, and there is lots of parking! The food is GREAT! The only issue is that every time I go the lady who takes our order cant get it right! She has issues with orders, receipts, giving us a number and you name it!! BUT the food is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Royal noodle, sushi and jasmine tea. So filling and delicious. Very large portions, should have only ordered one or the other"}
{"text":"A great vegan place in this local area, we will be coming here regularly while we're here on vacation."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the plentiful vegan options and I'm very pleased with the message the restaurant has on attempting to change the world with the addition of meat and chicken substitutes. I was also excited to read all of the positive messages written all over the place with information being given on being resourceful with water and other food sources. 
I've been here a few times and haven't left with a bad experience yet. The king pao \"chicken\" is really tasty as well as the gyros and fresh rolls. Rice is extra with all their dishes which can make the prices a little more expensive than they should be but it's nothing outrageous. The only dessert I've had is the flan and it's a  little more watery than regular flan. If you're looking for a dessert I suggest trying one of their other options."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The Beyond Burger is my go to meal. I've had it with both regular fries and sweet potato fries and both times was excellent.  Great little gem of a vegan restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't know how they do it without eggs but their chocolate cake is off the charts! My only complaint about this place is that I wish it was open longer had a drive-through and was next to every McDonald's in town. The food is fabulous it does not feel like you were eating vegan to me."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent! We had the Mongolian dish and burger and fries and ate every bite. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"this place was fabulous- the service, the food, the price-  visiting from out of town and was so grateful to find this gem.  had the golden nuggets, the won tons and the beef with rice.  service was quick kind and thorough.  loved it!"}
{"text":"Fan of the Loving Hut. Not this one, very disappointed. I ordered a tofu dish with vegetables and the amount of vegetables was embarrassing how few were included in the dish. Small tiny pea like size pieces cut up in amounts that I would guess/estimate would barely fill up a few tablespoons. I looked at the plate in disbelief how stingy the vegetable portion was. The other dish ordered was a dish we ordered many times at a Phoenix Loving hut and this one in comparison had little in the way of flavor and was a noticeably smaller portion. Both of us also came away not filled up. We won't be back at this loving hut and will continue to give our business to other Loving Huts."}
{"text":"Came because of the good reviews, Loving Hut did not disappoint. Just delicious. My father-in-law who is decidedly pro-meat loved his meal as well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a new place and we're giving it a \"thumbs up\" for best in class. Took my favorite vegan hippie for late lunch last Friday and, not being vegan myself, was very pleasantly surprised at the selection. I happen to like Pho, which is hard to find in LP, and so I had try the vegan Pho (apparently this in not an oxymoron). It was excellent, and I ended up taking half of it home because the serving was so large. We also had spring rolls, and they were crispy fresh and perfectly assembled. There were two large rolls on the order, cut in half. My favorite hippie had fried rice, and she ate every last bit. We tried two of the four vegan desserts: flan and cheesecake. Both were very good, vegan or not. The food also got a nod from the 11-month-old mini hippie who sampled all. Definitely a great change of pace, located near some serious competition. The unique menu and wide variety will be their advantage. We'll be back to try some different items. With the grand opening discount and drinking just water we spent about $25 with dessert and a tip. Service was attentive, but we were alone due the off-hour so can't say how they would due at peak times."}
{"text":"First of all, I am so very happy that people in the west valley have an all vegan eatery at their disposal.  This location is in a strip mall so there's lots of parking. The building is new, clean, and has a lovely outdoor patio area.

As most of us know, although Loving Hut is an international chain, each Loving Hut is individually owned, with some owners having multiple locations. This being said, I try to keep that in mind when trying a new location, because the menus vary based on ownership. I try...

On to the food...

SPICY CHA CHA $9.50 - Regardless of ownership, most U.S.A. location tend to sell this popular dish.  At one of my favorite local LH's (a different location), this dish comes with sauce (including a tartar sauce option) and your choice of fries or steamed veggies.  At this location, neither the sauce or a side is included. It was an additional $3.75 for a side of plain ole fries, and $0.75 for sauce. In total, this dish ended up being $5 extra dollars (compared to other LHs).


MONGOLIAN WONDER $9.25 - After a lot of indecisiveness, I ended up getting the Mongolian Wonder. I was asked if I wanted white or brown rice. I choose brown rice. I was not informed that it would be an additional charge (my favorite LH includes rice), but it was... $1.50 extra.  I was not a fan of the flavor. I've had this dish elsewhere and it was delightful, but not here. It was lacking and underwhelming.

GOLDEN WONTONS $5 - The fried wontons were perfect. Crispy, golden, and deliciously tasty. They, by far, were the best part of the experience. 

I had been here once before and tried their baked cheesecake, which is pretty good as well.


CUSTOMER SERVICE
The young lady (with awesome pink hair) who took my order at the counter was very nice and patient with us as we made our decisions. I never felt rushed or that she was annoyed.  There was a different girl who brought our food, and I was not a fan of how she kept reaching over our food.  There was an older gentleman who kept coming up front, and I was not a fan of him sneezing and not covering his mouth (he bowed his head but never covered his mouth). 

This location offers vegan gyros, which I haven't seen at other locations.  I want to try those, but I don't see myself making the 45 min to an hour drive back out there for OK food and nickel and dime practices.

It always pains me to give lower stars to vegan restaurants, but honestly, the fact that they are 100% vegan is the only reason the rating isn't lower."}
{"text":"One of the top places I've been to, great and friendly service, the food is too good to not finish, can't beat the prices, don't even get me started on the drinks! Most certainly coming back ( been there too many times to count) and of course recommend it to others ^.^"}
{"text":"The food is always great and much healthier than any of the restaraunt nearby. They can do takeout, smaller place with 10 tables inside and 4 or 5 outside. Very friendly people who know how to make good food. Even meat eaters like myself will find things they love here."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is getting 4 stars is due to the customer service at this location. My first time coming I misread online and arrived right close but hadn't been greeted for about 10 minutes or so, so I was kindly asked by what I presume to be their manager to eat outside and take my food to go. However from then I received my food and was rushed out the door only to discover outside that some of my food had been severely undercooked. Usually I would have told someone but I felt uncomfortable already that everyone was in such a hurry.
I came back today because as a new Vegan sometimes I'm desperate just to eat and not think about it so I ordered the Noble Broccoli with rice. The food was amazing but again the customer service was lacking as one of the female employees (a blonde I saw there before as well) had forgotten about someone's Tea and made a bunch of excuses before then coming back to ask the customer if she was 'mad at her.' The lady said she was not mad but the whole exchange definitely seemed to make her uncomfortable. They both were offput and shortly left without any tea. I love this place and will be back again I just am hoping that the ladies are taught a little bit more customer service skills to make the dining experience one that could be enjoyed more!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was so delicious. The food was fresh and light. We had the spring rolls,  pho, vegetable fried rice and arigato sushi. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes.i would definitely recommend trying the food.."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Loving Hut and eating Vegan. It was good. I will probably be back if my vegetarian employees want to come again. The service was great and the food is made to order, so I can take awhile for it all to come out if you have a large party. I ordered the pad Thai. It was good, but they used the wrong type of noodle. The noodle in my dish was more for pad see yu instead of pad Thai (which is a thin noodle). Still good."}
{"text":"Q:  Why did the tofu cross the road?
A:  To prove he wasn't chicken!

Firstly, the vegan pho was bomb. I thought I was gonna miss the bone broth but it was actually pretty flavorful. It doesn't even need the fake meat on the side.  The Spring Rolls were also pretty decent.  As for the Divine Curry, it was alright.  You can easily get this at any Chinese restaurant.  It is served with an insane amount of noodles and curry.  I wish it was on rice or served with some crusty french bread instead of noodles because the noodles got soggy right away and the vegetables ended up being overcooked and mushy.  I would pass on the Arigato Rolls too. These were completely uninteresting.

The food is good but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Service is a bit slow and impersonal.  This place does get super busy during lunch though so if you have a short lunch break, call ahead. All in all, not a bad place but I don't think I'd make any special trips to come out here."}
{"text":"Great variety of foods from American to Greek to Asian. I ordered the Texas BBQ Gyro. Although it wasn't a very authentic gyro, it tasted great!!

Will definitely be back try more!"}
{"text":"Great selection! We enjoyed the Mongolian beef and rice noodles. We look forward to coming again and trying something new."}
{"text":"3rd time here and i love the food ,they take their time but it's worth it ,the bbq bean burger is a must and also the the loving  hut Patty with fried mushrooms and onions, I'm planning to try more dishes."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place and enjoyed it very much. I recently cut meat out of my diet and am working up to plant based diet only. This place was able to show me it can be done and it's good."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant offers a very bad customer service. At first we came to this restaurant on Saturday with an grupon coupon and a waitress told us we can't use it because it is valid only monday-thursday and this was ok, it was our bad that we didn't read correctly. We came back today about 11.20am the owner of the business informed us that we can't use the coupon because it was previously redemeed. We answered we didn't use it and even if we would try to do it twice, it would be impossible because our first visit was on Saturday when the promo is not possible to use so actually how could we do it? I could stand problems like that without any negative feelings but also very disappointing was the he even wasn't try to help us and just continously discussed that the coupon was already used and we should contact with grupon. It was very unprofessional and disappointing because the restaurant should take care about that error and don't force us to contact with anybody. It is impossible to use the coupon on Saturdays so it was defenitely NOT customers bad. If the restaurant don't take care about its customers it is not worth to visit. I know restaurants realities very good and I know mistakes and errors are happening very often but with such a wrong atitude of the owner who don't care and even don't try to solve problems he showed us a lack of respect."}
{"text":"I'm a meat and potatoes girl, quite literally I could eat that almost every day, but dating a vegetarian/vegan I try my best to open my mind and tastebuds to something new and more practical long term. I think the problem for most is the taste, I've had a veggie burger at a really nice/expensive place who's signature dish is a burger, but the veggie fell flat, dry and without flavor. It's even hard to find the right meat alternative at a grocery store, nothing ever tasted right or close to the real thing and it left me without ideas and dinners consistently boring. 
Of course there were lots of hip, new and modern vegetarian places to eat but they were also either all in central Phoenix or Scottsdale. 

Finally I find The Loving Hut, a vegan restaurant for the west side with lots of good reviews, I was crossing my fingers that this place would be decent enough to please my picky eater. It was packed even an hour before closing, staff was very friendly and the food looked as advertised and tasted really good! We tried the Loving Hut Patty burger with grilled mushrooms, pineapple, and onions, as well as the Sweet and Sour Divine (\"chicken\"). Not once did my brain think it tasted any different than the real thing. The flavors were great and while I don't think I could ever give up meat entirely it didn't feel like a necessity anymore and it had me thinking \"I could totally eat this every day!\"

Unfortunately the only down side is the price, for the two drinks and two entrees it was over $35 and that's not including the tip and then I paid for a refill and a small slice of the baked cheesecake (which was amazing). After everything the grand total for just the two of us was $53!! I definitely think for the portion size they could cut down on price and refills are expensive. 
I'm sad that we won't be able to come here very often because it's just way too expensive. Even without the refills or the delicious cheesecake, $35-40 is still a lot for dinner at a place that really isn't that fancy (self serve water, get your own napkins and utensils kind of place).
I'm not sure how much meat alternatives cost in bulk but surely there is a way to cut down on cost so more people could try this place and see just how good eating vegetarian/vegan can be!"}
