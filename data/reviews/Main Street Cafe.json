{"text":"Great friendly service. Drinks are heavy and you get allot for your money. Best grey goose martini I've had in a long time. Highly recommended. Sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food and the prices. Ordered the filet sliders and they were dripping with blue cheese, menu said Gorgonzola. The salmon wrap was completely bland. The antipasto salad it came with was cold, canned garbanzo beans tossed with balsamic vinaigrette. My daughter ordered the bacon cheeseburger and really enjoyed it. It cost $5 to substitute fries for the boxed potato chips it came with. 

Overall a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"The service was fine, but the food was grossly overpriced, bland, and had zero creativity.  The atmosphere looks tired and old fashioned. Not one of the four if us even at half if their meal. My husband had a mediterranean salad, with what appeared to be fake feta cheese- it had NO taste. I think it was fake cheese. All salad dressings were too sweet. My entree with looked like something I threw together after work. I'll drive the extra 15 minutes for a much more creative tasteful meal.  The wine list was so-so-@ minimum $8.00 for a glass.  Come on Medina! So disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for lunch today. Unfortunately our experience was not good. For our first time being there we were excited to try this place. The menu has so many wonderful things to try made it even more exciting. I ordered the lobster bisque soup and the mushroom bruschetta, which had a variety of different mushrooms with a vegan Caesar dressing on top of multigrain bread all of this was on top of mixed greens. My soup was very salty hardly any lobster and very runny consistency. Not good I couldn't eat it. The server took it away asked if I wanted something else but I was not interested in trying another soup. I couldn't get the salt taste out of my mouth I didn't want to add to it. The mushroom bruschetta was bland and it seem to have only a couple of the mushrooms on the it. The menu listed a variety of different mushrooms that are suppose to be on it. The taste was not there it was not very good. 
My friend ordered the beef sliders WELL done and fries that are $5.00 extra to have fries. The server said they are hand cut this is why it's extra. Big deal we have gone to many wonderful places and had hand cut fries that did not charge extra to be with a burger and some have charged and they only charge $2.00. The sliders came out rare very gross we told the server, she took them back to the kitchen. When the server came back to the table she apologized and said the cook did not read the ticket and that she did put well done on the ticket. Now my friend is grossed out to have taken a bite of rare beef, when her food came back the whole appeal was gone, she did eat one but she said it wasn't great she couldn't eat the others, she said they were bland just not good and the fries were ok not worth the $5.00. The whole time at our table (there are little lamps at the tables) there were little fruit flies constantly flying around the light and regular flies. That bothered me it felt like the place wasn't clean. Actually the whole meal wasn't worth any money at all!! The server must have felt the same way she didn't charge us for anything. We were grateful. We did tip her, none of this was her fault. The kitchen needs to get it together. We will not ever go back. Also, we were the only customers in there. No one came in the whole time we were there. To top everything off the bathroom was gross very dirty. Ugh not a good experience, we are not interested in ever going back."}
{"text":"I knew it was pricey going in but $7 for a kids grilled cheese (literally 2 pieces of bread and a slice of cheese) and $6 for a side of mashed potatoes for an 8 year old. The food was over priced for the bland dinner I got. Add to that the fact our medium burger was almost moo - ing and I am over it. Tried to go on a limb, try something new. What a bust."}
{"text":"Awesome Martini!...was here for a business meeting didn't have time to try the food hopefully next time"}
{"text":"Horrible. Worst prime rib I was ever served. It was more like pot roast than prime rib. Had to return it. Horrible french onion soup. 6 of us ate there...none of us enjoyed our meal. Used to be a great restaurant. Now totally different. Friday night and only 3 groups there. No wonder why. STAY AWAY!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!####"}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived in medina now for a few years and have tried many places so last night we decided to try somewhere new which was Marie's Cafe. I got the bronzed salmon and he got the Delmonico steak. First off our waiter was horrible. I dont know if he was new or what but very slow and just not personable. The food took an hour just to get our appetizer which we had to ask where it was multiple times. Then when the food finally came it was quite a disappointment. My husbands steak was supposed to be medium well and it was way over done. You could barely chew it. The asparagus on his plate was under cooked except for one which was black from being burnt. It was straight awful food. My plate was not any better. The salmon was also way overcooked. I had to use a knife to cut it up. You never should need a knife on salmon. Also the risotto it came with was not even edible. It had shrimp, sun dried tomatoes, black olives from a can, and banana peppers. The weirdest combination ever. We didnt even wait for thr check to come. My husband just put our card out on the table and we waived down our waiter and told him we were ready to go. Definetly recommend not wasting any money every going here. We definetly will never step foot in this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Worst eating experience. I would give zero stars if possible. We went there for the first time for Sunday lunch on March 18th. I ordered their nachos for my meal after reading it's description of chips, olives, tomatoes, cheese, chili. My other three friends ordered burgers and of course my simple order came late after the others had already eaten about half of their meals. How is it that Nachos takes longer to prepare when it is not cooked but heated up to melt the cheese.
Anyway, I got my order and started eating. It was not long before I realized that there was no chili on it. At first I thought maybe it was on the bottom under the chips like some sort of dip. Remember, this is the only meat on the dish and probably the most expensive ingredient. So I dug down and no chili. I asked the waitress and instead of making another order correctly, went to ask her manager what to do. By now the others were done eating. She came back and said that since I started eating it the only thing they would do is heat up chili and bring me a bowl of it.
I am a firm believer that you should get what you pay for. I don't care paying as long as I know they are making what they say they will on the menu. The waitress said maybe the manager will take a couple of bucks off the bill. It was a $10 appetizer and it was about right. No, the manager would not budge. By now it was a matter of principle. The cook had not prepared it correctly, who by my fee was paid for their labor. I paid for all of the ingredients, even what was missing. 
It was not the waitresses fault, a high school student. (still tipped her 20%) it's just I expected more from this cafe. Now I will never return there nor will I recommend it to anyone and will go out of my was to discourage business there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  service and food! What more could you want?! Oh and its super cute on the Square."}
{"text":"My favorite romantic dining establishment! The booths in the bar are candle lit, quiet and romantic. The food is wonderful and the staff is fabulous."}
{"text":"Food was okay, service was slow, randomly assigned up-charges not detailed on menu or explained fully by wait staff. Eg. $11 Sandwich comes with chips, the menu gives the option in the menu with no price, easy to assume 2 or 3 dollar up-charge, right? Wrong. $5 for substituting fries."}
{"text":"Sign says open until midnight, but kitchen closes at 10PM. Server was hard to find & $8 for a shallow bowl of half cooked fries seemed a tad pricey. Decent NY Strip Sammie. Also, asked server for wine list, but must have been too difficult for her to find. Sad!"}
{"text":"From the freezer into the fryer grouper. Bottom of the bag chips. Strange tasting French onion soup. Wasn't asked if I wanted fries instead of chips. Wine and service (Erica) was good."}
{"text":"Booth's are tiny, service is OK at best. Order bone in ribeye medium, came out RARE, wife ordered filet with bernause sauce, both steak and sauce cold, mind you, this was at 8:30 and very few tables to cook and serve. Prices are way to high for just average meal. Longhorn meal and value are much better. Sorry Main Street, up your game and reviews will follow."}
{"text":"I was excited to go here since they offered a lot of vegan options. Unfortunately, not one of the options sounded remotely like something I would want to eat. It seemed like a non-vegan attempted to put together a menu of random foods they knew were vegan. I got the grilled heart of romaine Caesar salad for lunch....which tasted nothing like a Caesar salad. The romaine itself was absolutely perfect, but everything else thrown on top was borderline gagging. Everything tasted like salt and vinegar. There were some \"crouton\" pieces of bread on top of the salad that were pretty good, but there was only a couple bites worth. Besides that, there really wasn't much to the salad, despite the waitress recommending it and saying it was \"huge\". I was hungry again an hour later. Our waitress was nice, but I needed a refill of my water and never got one. Also, I didn't enjoy eating in darkness, especially at 1pm."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for the Sunday Champagne Brunch. The most enticing part is that the whole meal is $30! Thirty dollars for 5 courses and endless champagne! 

The first course is Soup. I got the french onion soup which I found to be delicious and probably the best course out of the five. 

The second course, salad, I ordered the baby greens salad, big mistake! It was literally just leafy greens with nothing else and dressing on the side. No vegetables, cheese or croutons just leaves! 

The third course, appetizers, I ordered the crab-shrimp strudel. The flavor was there but that was about it. The shrimp were the tiniest shrimp ever, not what I was expecting. I really thought/was hoping it would either be a jumbo shrimp or two medium shrimps in the strudel. There were just too many little shrimps that the dish became overwhelming and I couldn't finish it. 

The fourth course, entree, I ordered the beef wellington and this is where the hiccup came. When our entrees came out I received the Potato Crusted Walleye. While a friend of mine shared her Beef Wellington with me so that I didn't have to wait while everyone else ate, I wasn't impressed by either meal. The walleye was the weirdest fillet of fish I have ever seen in my eating career and I couldn't taste the capers in the walleye and that might have been because there weren't any in my dish. The beef wellington was okay but lacked flavor. The entree portion was simply disappointing.

The last course, dessert, was actually great! I ordered the cranberry orange cheesecake. The flavor was perfect and not a bit overwhelming. My friends all agreed that the besides the soup the dessert was the best dish."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. Waitress did not know menu--we had questions and finally had to ask her to go ask some other staff member what we wanted to know. Salad was dry, field greens with not one other item except the dressing. My husband's chicken  and pasta was good. My beef braciole had such a spicy sauce that I could barely eat it even after scraping the sauce off. Bread was good.  My husband is usually a generous tipper but he left barely 10% tonight.  Quaint place but disappointing overall experience and food."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by for a Drink and to social during the lunch hour. There was no Host waiter or anyone to seat us so we sat our self. So we waited and wait still no waiter or anyone so we got up and left and took are business some where else. 

     Went their for mothers day one Time for Brunch it was so a complete Joke the staff took their sweet little time with the food by the time the food came out I had to send it back because I had to leave at work and plus I never got to enjoy it. What a waist of money to spend on a mothers day brunch. Thanks main street café I believe you can do better."}
{"text":"We (4 adults, 3 kids) came here for lunch before hitting Castle Noel.  I don't have many nice things to say, and I actually left angry after I paid $70 for completely mediocre food (2 adult and 2 kids entrees).  My filet sliders were fatty meat with a pile of dry cheese and barely cooked \"caramelized\" onions.  The chips were not house chips but straight from a bag.  Cheddar fries were regular fries with a sprinkle of cold shredded cheddar.  Nobody at our table of 7 had a good experience.  There are all kinds of places on the square - do yourself a favor and try a different one."}
{"text":"Overall: Decent food in a restaurant with a lot of character 

Food: I had the Quiche Du Jour with a house salad. The salad was very boring: it was just greens with a side of dressing. I expected some other topping included. The quiche itself was very nicely presented but unfortunately underseasoned and bland. The Entree was $12, which was reasonable.

Atmosphere: This is what stood out about the restaurant. It had a Victorian pub feel. Intimate spaces with quirky decor and low lighting."}
{"text":"First time here. Food and service was good. 

Disappointed that the dinner salad was just a bowl of lettuce (no cucumbers, tomatoes, cheese or croutons). It needed something to spice up the presentation  and color. 
Surprised the Potato Crusted Walleye was served with both rice and mashed potatoes. That's a lot of starch. 
Top of the bun on a burger was burnt black. Bad presentation."}
{"text":"The place looks nice, but the staff is not so bright.  There was no napkin or knife at my place setting.  There were not enough menus for everyone seated.  The waitress was nice.  I ordered a Porterhouse medium rare and I got a burnt T-Bone.  I have no idea why they even thought to serve a burnt steak.  I should have known when the burnt steak smell wafting from the kitchen, and I should have left.  My veggies were mixed with the mashed potatoes.  I almost thought it was some veggies and mashed potatoes that were scraped off of someone else's plate and thrown onto mine.  I seriously do not think they know their cuts of meat or how to serve meat.  I cut the steak up and discovered that 3/4 of it was burnt and all the fat turned to charcoal.  I sent it back, but I was still charged for the stake. I took a bite of my companions Crab Oscar (filet also burnt) and I had to run to the bathroom to vomit it up.  The crab was \"off\"  as if it was previously frozen and not handled properly.  Drinks were good.  Salad was basically spring mixed greens from a bag with dressing.  The quality of food I would rate below a Sizzlers.  

Don't go here unless you want to waste money and deal with dingy staff."}
{"text":"Food and service was very good years ago. To many children working there now. Service is slow and food is way over priced. Theres one waitress with blondish hair that wears it up who is rudest of all. She shakes the bar as she STOMPS past. Her brother used to cook there which surprised me as he was around 18. $40 steak cooked by a kid with no credentials. 
   We ordered Filet at the bar and when it arrived it was rotten. The smell was unmistakable. They took it away with no apology. We had to go elsewhere as that was the last one they had. Still had to pay for the one drink we had before we could go.  For several months we ate there three times a week. Ive watched it go down down down. And wheres the owner? Not there. No wonder. Its being run by children. 
No thanks. Ill go to Sullys Irish pub. Right across the ally."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for a spontaneous dinner. We were promptly greeted at the door and seated right away. We had the Bruschetta appetizer and it was different but AMAZINGLY good. Salads were an awesome blend of different greens. We both had the Delmonico special with mushroom gravy, redskin potatoes, and asparagus. They were heavenly. Our server was superb, and we will frequent this establishment as we live close by!"}
{"text":"Five of us had lunch here today. We each got something different from the Vegan menu. They were all delicious! We follow a plant based, no oil diet. Never get this many options in most restaurants. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the positives. Had great service, and the atmosphere was -- well -- traditional. To the negatives. The food was awful and way over-priced. My 3 year old ordered a grilled cheese, and the server asked what she wanted with it and if we wanted a drink for her. I asked for potatoes and a milk. Turns out -- both of these items were a la carte and my 3 year old's dinner (grilled cheese, mashed potatoes, milk, which she took 3 bites of) was $16!!!! Are you kidding me? I had a \"French Dip\" sandwich that looked like it came from a fast food window. This place is awful."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Wednesday night. We ordered 3 burgers and a kids grilled cheese. I had asked for a side salad with my burger. It was the best white vinaigrette salad dressing. That was the only good part of our meal. The salad was a plate of lettuce. No tomato, cucumber, not even a crouton to be found. Burgers arrived almost an HOUR later. They were dried out, and the buns were crappy and soggy from the meat siting there under the heat lamps for God knows how long (because the plates were hot... Meals weren't!). My husband ordered fries - waitress said there would be an up charge - got the bill - $6! For fries... That were super soggy and oily. Long of the short: cool, old decor. That's about it. Burgers were 12-15$ and way overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, bloated prices.. but certainly worth it for a romantic, elegant evening on the Square in Medina. Small tables with quaint, dim-lit mood lights make for a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Come here when you want to take your time and enjoy a great meal.  Everything is made from scratch, and many of their meats and other ingredients are organic.  It's a little slow-paced, but it's always a nice experience.  Their Sunday brunch is superb and a great value."}
{"text":"This has been one of the better restaurants in Medina County for years.  Great ambiance, especially around the holidays, where it sits on one of the prettiest town squares in the country.  Particularly good for dinners with your sig other."}
{"text":"First time that I have eaten  there.  The inside was beautiful and very quiet.  As noontime we arrived and the place was almost empty.  That seems to be a sign.  The menu was huge and I was excited to order the French dip which was advertised as prime rib on a crusty hoagie served au jus.  I ordered the french fries and cole slaw separate.    When the lunch arrived I was extremely disappointed that the prime rib was the lunch meat variety of roast beef.   Not only was it extremely salty but the au jus looked like the package add water kind of gravy.  The french fries which were $5.00 extra and they were not at all crisp but soggy and undercooked.  Since I went out with a friend I did not complain as I should have.  For desert had a creme brûlée and coffee.  The entire lunch came to $33.00.  Ouch!  Not going back."}
{"text":"Came here for a MeetUp for plant based food, before the Medina Ice Festival. 

I could not be more disappointed in the service, or the food. The ambiance and building was much to my liking, but I honestly can't say that it really deserves a whole store with how rough everything else was.

It's easy to say plant based food is gross, because many people assume it's lettuce. That's fair, if one doesn't have an interest, why would they dig in? Having met people who cook, they can make absolutely crazy delicious meals with zero products. Making their own sour cream, \"cheese,\" meat substitute, so on- they make a full complete meal that tastes great.

Here, I received noodles with vegetables on top. The pasta was cooked, but no flavor or taste. The vegetables were awful- not cooked enough to be COOKED, but too cooked for one to argue it was \"raw.\"  Apparently the chef doesn't use any oil. Oil isn't needed. My cooking friend started cooking with average food, and has transitioned to plant only. I assumed that a chef would be able to do the same, but I have no idea what happened here.

The bubbly individual who served us had a habit of forgetting things. They were not aware of any food details, and disappeared for significant periods of time. Thinking of my experience, this can't get a second star. The only real perk was that the food was relatively cheap for the area, but still very expensive for what it is- $10 for some noodles and vegetables."}
{"text":"This was just not good. My spouse and I decided to drop in after work for a bit to eat so around 5:30/6 and we were the only ones there! We were greeted and sat. Then took 5 mins to come take our drink order. Co2 for Soda was flat, one of the kegs had already exploded, so I ordered a bottle of beer, and our app. Took roughly 15 mins or more to get those. Only to find out through online while at the table they had a draft beer special??? But my waitress didn't even bother to tell us that when I ordered a beer and asked?? so when she came back I asked what the specials where.... She then told me. So I ordered a 2.99 draft instead of the 7.99 bottle. THEN she took our food order. Roughly 30 mins after we were there. The service was slow which I could understand IF we weren't the only ones there, but instead our waitress and another server were sitting two tables behind us just chatting and polishing silverware..... Also all of it was cold.... I ordered the lobster stuffed grouper - sounds delicious huh?? It was stuffed with not lobster but tiny frozen salad shrimp instead!! The fries were frozen and heated up in the microwave. You could tell by how soggy they were. Overall awful food. Expensive prices. And POOR service."}
{"text":"While my family has eaten a nice brunch at Main Street Cafe, we had never tried the dinner, until last night.

Friday nights in the summer feature \"Rally in the Alley,\" a great little musical event featuring a couple of rock bands behind the restaurant.  You can access the alley through the back door of the restaurant, or via either of the side streets.  Fun, loud, drunk experience, but not what I would consider family-friendly.  (The announcer between acts suggested that we parents could buy booze ice cream for our kids to help them sleep.  Ahem.)

We were really there to eat, having had a nice brunch experience there last spring.  While there were several hundred people in the alley, there were all of four tables of patrons actually inside the restaurant.  The hostess was very patient, explaining that we were free to wander out to the alley (without buying a thing, if you can imagine such a radical business scheme) and asking our seating preference.  There is a main, high-ceilinged dining room, brick walls, antique furniture, very 1890's.  There is a bar area, with a small, elevated seating area, halfway between the main room and the alley.  There is also, downstairs, a wine cellar.  Situated as Main Street Cafe is, dead center on the west side of the fabulous Medina Square, the setting is about as middle America as you could get outside a Frank Capra movie.

Our server was very efficient, smiling all the while, patiently explaining the five menus placed before us:  The Dinner Menu, The Small Plates Menu, The Bar Menu, The Drink Special Menu, and The Wine List.  A bit daunting.  We asked if there were a kids menu, too, and were informed that is was a \"verbal menu,\" which I suppose makes that our sixth menu of the night.  (While the quantity of menus was grand, the quality wasn't:  Each was printed on light cardboard and seemed to have been used as beer mug coasters over the years.)

I first reviewed the Dinner Menu.  Here's where the wheels fall off.  The prices are way, and I mean WAY out of line with the entire experience.  Small town America, great location, lots of attentive staff, but in no way is this place anything but a great local eatery.  The prices were in line with steak places I've visited in Manhattan, Hong Kong, San Francisco and Sydney.  Those places, though, were \"destination restaurants.\"  Main Street, while pleasant, is not.

So, on to the Small Plates.  Great selection, a lot of interesting combinations, some usual for small plates, some unique.  I was concerned, though, that for my thirty bucks I may get only enough to make me more hungry, not less.  So, on to the Bar Menu.  My wife asked the server to tell her about the Caeser Salads.  \"What do you mean?\"  she replied.  Well, is it good?  Are the greens out of a bag?  Is the dressing made fresh?  \"I could bring you a taste, if you like.\"  Great idea, and she did, promptly, bring us a tast that would have been enough for two full salads.  My wife's response, \"It's okay.\"  She ordered the Caeser with steak.  I had a pulled-pork BBQ sandwich with Swiss and fries, and my daughter had the nacho plate from the kids menu.

The nachos arrived first, and were of a size and magnitude for a frat house beer night.  Huge.  Very artfully presented, fresh and satisfying.  The Caeser and BBQ were right behind, and both were just okay.  (The steak in the Caeser was reported to be very, very good, though.)  We had ordered a bottle of wine from the menu, and were asked what number.  What number?  I have to look up a number?  \"That's how the wine cellar is organized.\"  Huh.  Curious.

That number wasn't in the wine cellar, so we tried again.  That one was, and it was very good.  Chilled, served properly and held at table in a stone cooler.  We were never without attention throughout the meal, and our server kept the meal moving perfectly.  When the bill came, it seemed to be under what I had expected, and upon review I found she hadn't charged for the wine.  \"I'm glad you mentioned that, I wouldn't have.\"  Odd comment.

Over all, this would be a fine place to make as our \"local night out\" place, if not for the prices.  I don't mind spending that kind of coin, but in return we had better receive world-class atmosphere, service, food and overall level of culinary expertise.  The night we were there, I estimate there were three staff to every customer.  Most were standing around, waiting for something to do.  All were smiling, pleasant and seemed to be experienced, but I have to wonder if all that overhead is what drives the prices.  

A quick note about the bathroom.  As it is right next to the back door, which leads to the \"Rally in the Alley,\" it is probably used by ten times more people than actually eat in the restaurant.  It wasn't clean, and we were in and out of the dining room before eight o'clock.  I always wonder:  if they can't keep the bathroom clean, what's the kitchen like?"}
{"text":"Decor is nice. Service was OK. Our server didn't seem particularly interested in actually serving us. She did bare minimum. I ordered lobster bisque & it was just OK. I did like the actual pieces of lobster in it though. Main dish; salmon wrap. Again, just OK. My dad ordered breaded walleye ($17) Well, take a look @ my pic..BURNT! When he tried sending it back, he was told just try it. Uh no, so the next batch of fish was burnt exactly the same. Server response? Oh our fryer is old. No, old oil OR high heat. He ended up with a seafood strudel which he said was really good."}
{"text":"Filet sliders with Brie, grilled onions and garlic aioli hit the spot. Cooked perfectly. Also got the lobster bisque which wasn't that interesting and fries were soggy. Staff was super nice and on top of their game. Would go back for the interesting menu."}
{"text":"Been before help was terrific
Food was good
Went today was ignored by the help didn't stay long enough for the food
Walked out after 20minutes of Being ignored 
Really don't know if I'd go back"}
{"text":"Went there before Rally in the Alley, which is sponsored by Main Street, and had great quick snack.  I have been there several times and the story is the same.  There is great service and great food.  The menu has a nice selection of entrees, salads & apps.  Prices tend to be on the higher side, but i have no problem with this since it keeps the riff raff out.  They can eat at Denny's.  There is a downstairs bar that will have live entertainment and another full bar upstairs in the back."}
{"text":"When we saw the menu, we were thrilled at their vegan selections, and couldn't wait to try some.  

We tried their grilled romaine Caesar.  It was awful.  The seasoning was overpowered with so much oregano that we couldn't taste anything else.  We also tried their vegan burger.  It was dry, and bland.  The bread was stale.  It came with a side of beans with black olives that had yet again, too much oregano.  Perhaps the chef's favorite spice?   

The children's items we ordered were almost worse.  The chicken fingers were so tough that I couldn't cut them up with a steak knife.  I'm surprised that no one choked.  The child's cheeseburger was $14.  Even though the menu read $9, the server assured me that it was really $14 because the 6 greasy, undercooked fries that came with it were $5 extra.  (She never informed me beforehand.). My child then asked if his drink was supposed to be so gross- so I tasted his Shirley temple.  It was soda water with maybe a splash of grenadine.  

How dare I ask for olive oil with the bread, because the server informed me they don't have olive oil!   I said- you don't have any Olive oil? Oh ok. Then she said she did- but it didn't have seasoning in it.  I explained that I just wanted plain olive oil.  She brought that over promptly, and I must say that I am not  an olive oil expert by any means, but it was very obvious she brought me vegetable oil. 

This place only needs one word for me to describe it. AWFUL."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cute and cozy place for a quick cheap meal, do not go here.

If you are looking for a cute and cozy place for a lengthy meal that'll set you back a bit, this is your place.

Went with a group of 3 other women. We ordered the stuffed banana peppers and a crab and  shrimp strudel. The stuffed  peppers were HOT. I took one bite and drank 2 glasses of water. The strudel was delicious.

All the entrees come with a house salad, and 2 sides unless it's a pasta. There are tons of options, and about 4 menus to go with it. There was also a prix fixe menu with 4 courses for $22. Definitely a good deal at this place.

For dinner I got a steak, asparagus and red skin potatoes. All 3 were great, although my steak was overdone, I was too hungry to complain.

The waitress was great, really knew the menu and explained  a few  of the dishes. She also let my step mom make her own dish. My water glass was never empty and we were there for about 2 hours!

For dessert they had a good variety. My grandma ordered the NY cheesecake, my step mom got pumpkin cheesecake and I ordered the apple spiced bourbon sorbet. I didn't like it, but the presentation was great with a crepe rolled on top. It was too \"spiced\" for my taste.  The NY cheesecake was AWESOME.

I don't know what the bill came to, but with entrees being priced from $25-$30 for the most part, I am guessing the whole deal was around $175 before the tip with 2 glasses of wine. 

It's a small place with a  full bar in the back and a downstairs also. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"If you're vegan, save yourself the time and expense of this dump.  I got the veggie burger which was not much bigger than a half dollar and was served on a tiny random roll of some sort (not one made for sandwiches).  It came with a tiny serving of an antipasto \"salad\" which was rotten.  I also ordered a side salad and it was literally lettuce only!  If you're going to be that cheap at least add a few shaved carrots for color, so it looks like you made some effort at presentation.  The prices and the quality of food couldn't have been further apart.  This might be the worst restaurant I've ever been to.  I'd definitely give zero stars if that were an option."}
{"text":"First time here...Great atmosphere, tons of charm. Lots of menu options, good wine and beer list, staff was super friendly. Food was delicious! I'm definitely going back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Recently went for lunch with a friend, service was good (sat at the bar). Ordered a wrap with a side of potato chips, it was pretty good. The bartender Deb is awesome! She is friendly and knows how to make great drinks."}
{"text":"really good lunch.  i had salmon wrap, which was good.  wife had hummus wrap, which was great.  split the brie app, which was a tad of a disappointment, but probably because it couldn't live up to its amazing presentation.  goes with that whole dark decor thing, which is fine for some, but not my ideal....and i dont think it matches their new american menu.  

but definitely a winner."}
{"text":"Prices were high, while the food was average. Overall it wasn't terrible, but I just expected more for what you're paying. There's definitely better places in the area to eat at that are cheaper.

Also it was very dark in there, I had to use my phones flashlight to see the menu."}
{"text":"We made reservations for Saturday night to celebrate our birthdays. The entire meal was a huge disappointment...the waitress was noticeably inexperienced and the food sub par. Salad was a plate of unchilled greens with dressing on the side, not a tomato or cuke in sight! My husband ordered soup as an appetizer which eventually arrived after dinner when the plates were being cleared. We all ordered some type of steak as an entrée...I ordered the 16 oz.  bone in rib eye, medium rare...when served it didn't even slightly resemble the description on the menu...the steak was less than a half an inch thick, no bone, covered in sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms, it was well done, tough and tasted like it was boiled in a pan of au jus.   Another dinner was the bacon wrapped filet...my husband said the texture was on the mushy side and not cooked to order. The filet medallions, topped with shrimp, crab and drizzled with béarnaise was anything but was depicted on the menu... the medallions were 3 chunks of fillet, the shrimp was of the canned salad variety baked in phyllo and served on the side, the crab wasn't obvious. The béarnaise was on the side and cold. A NY strip served to another diner in our party was also overcooked. Presentation was sloppy to say the least with every steak sitting on a pile of mashed potatoes making cutting the steak difficult on a crowded plate!  Additionally, every plate was served barely warm. If it were just I and my husband the dinners would have been returned to the kitchen...but we were dining with my elderly, in-laws and didn't want to make a fuss that would upset them since we were celebrating special birthdays. I saw rave reviews for their lunch menu and cocktails perhaps that should be their forte. This is definitely not a 3 or even a 2 star restaurant for the dinner crowd. We will not be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I went there for my mother-in-law's birthday. We did the champagne brunch one Sunday and had a great time with a decent sized group of family in attendance. The menu has some rather interesting options to choose from. Overall, the meal was a nice way to spend a Sunday morning. We sat in a big booth next to the window facing Public Square! Not a bad view. The restaurant was still decorated for Christmas and so it gave it a rather nice, cozy ambiance. Will probably go back there again sometime! 

Also, the bar is beautifully adorned so if you stop through there, check out the bar and also the basement wine cellar. Great little spot! Kinda pricey though"}
{"text":"Although the decor of this place is very dated and over the top Victorian style, I truly enjoyed my visit.

I ordered a burger, and you can substitute any burger for a bison burger at no extra charge(so of course I did so)!  My burger was cooked perfectly!  It was the best burger I have had in a while.  It was served with chips, but I substituted fresh cut fries which were also amazing! 

All around good experience, just don't let the atmosphere fool you :)"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and outstanding menu selection. I've been eating here for years, and it never fails to impress!"}
{"text":"My sister was in the area from Florida.  We were enjoying a day of shopping and decided to try the Main Street Cafe for lunch.
We loved the décor!!!  
I was impressed with the number if Vegan items on the menu!  
My sister, selected the soup and salad lunch.  She paired Tomato- Artichoke soup with a half Chef Salad.  She said the soup was the best she had eaten.  The salad was a generous portion for a half salad.  She said it was very good.  The dressing that came on it was tasty and light.
I chose a Vegan Burrito.  It was served with Vegan chips and fresh Pico salsa. I suggest task ng for double or triple Pico.
The Burrito filled half of the plate (I brought half if it home.). It was filled with highly seasoned rice and beans, greens etc. It was even better heated the following day.
The server was friendly and checked with us shortly after serving our food. It would have been nice if she either waited a bit longer to check with us or came a second time as we had to wave down another server when I needed a refill of water.  
The atmosphere was very relaxed making our lunch time more enjoyable. 
This was my first visit to the Main Street Cafe but it will not be my last!"}
{"text":"Filet sliders. BBQ chicken sandwich. Buffalo chicken salad - 4. Great beer selection, great prices. Lots of character."}
{"text":"Always love to come here. It is a nicely dim lit restaurant with a good amount of options on the menu. The food can range from normal bar food such as a huge plate of loaded nachos and burgers to a complete list of vegan options to lobster and steak items.Complimentary water, folded napkins and polished looking silverware. A couple TVs at the bar to also give that sports bar feel in that area. Friendly staff and a great place to visit if you are on the square of Medina."}
