{"text":"Really good Chinese!  Small restaurant, very friendly and attentive staff.  My personal favorites are the sesame chicken and the cold sesame noodles.  They do offer several levels of \"hot\" on some dishes.  When I took relatives from San Fransisco and Chicago to Shanghai, they ordered the hottest level of hot and it was still milder than what they could get locally.  So keep this is mind.  Beer and wine only - no liquor.  And the limited wine selection is the only thing that holds me back from awarding that fifth star.  Easy to find on Park Road and reasonably priced.  I will drive past at least three other Chinese restaurants to get takeout from Shanghai."}
{"text":"Sadly, this wonderful local, family place has closed down. RIP Shanghai, we hardly knew you."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday when my three friends and I entered the restaurant. The dining area was very plain, looked like no one made an effort, and there was a TV playing an American channel. There were two servers that evening, a lady and a young man. We entered and sat down at one of the tables as the lady gave us the takeout menu (which is also their dine-in menu). Throughout our meal, the lady was rude and ignored us, she even made eye contact with us,  however quickly looked and walked away. The younger man was kind, however you can tell he couldn't multitask very well. The kitchen took a long time to cook our food, we waited 30 minutes to receive our food. (Just a side note, there were only three other occupied tables and two of them already received their food). I ordered the red curry with coconut milk, and I could easily say that it was the worse red curry I've ever tasted and seen. I felt like I was basically drinking oil. On top of this, I had to pay an additional $1.85 for a bowl of white rice which was stale. My friends ordered the combo specials which came with fried rice, bean sprouts, spring roll, and chicken balls. Their meal portions were pretty big and could be eaten for two meals. If you want a typical Americanized Chinese dish, you can order this for about $7.00, however it's nothing special. We had hoped that we would enjoy our experience since we never checked out the restaurant ever since they were \"under new management\", however after going there for dinner, we quickly knew to never go here again."}
{"text":"This place is really. Really. Bad. I'm surprised it hasn't been shut down ...... the buffet they don't really put food out. At. All. There were 4 spring rolls. Broccoli. Wontons ... and that's it. They don't fill it unless you ask. It was embarrassing and a joke. I was there Today & 9 people complained there was no food ....... there was NO FOOD. It was so unkept. I saw a lady cutting chicken ontop of there freezer. I don't even want to talk about the bathroom. $8.99 for lunch all u can eat. But they don't put food out which is probably how they save money????????? I was really confused why there was just burnt of food and scraps. Should of took a picture it was 1pm too."}
{"text":"The buffet is small compared to other all you can eat buffet such as Mandarin one. 

But the food is pretty good.  If you can get the lobster and crab it's actually a very good deal :) 

Service is ok. 

Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I drive out here for these reasons:

I like me some fake duck.
They have an insane wine list, and a decent beer list.

Closed on Monday, open for lunch and dinner the rest of the week, Shanghai is better-than-average Chinese fare that has a full page of veg-friendly options. It is also very affordable, with mains coming in at about $9-$10 each. Its a smaller menu than I'm used to, and not everything is available (looking to try the \"vegetarian seafood medley\" I was informed it was no longer being served, since no one was ordering it). A surprising number of the appetizers are, however. We went with Lettuce Cups, which was pretty standard, except for the sauce that accompanied it. No plum sauce here, but spicy, watery, sweet-sour hot mustard! Wowza! I was happy.

Like Donna said, they'll do whatever level of hot you want. I ordered my stuff at a 9 (out of 10) and wasn't satisfied. You can ask for whole chili's rather than dried flakes, and that's my plan for the next time I come, 'cos I crave the heat. 

I'd have another star to award Shanghai, but I find the lack of veg-friendly soups a little sad, having to pick through their larger-than-what-they-actually-serve menu a bit of a hassle, and the flavors a little far over the \"too sweet\" line."}
{"text":"Food decent, service decent, ambiance decent, overall decent. It's probably the best place to get Chinese food in Rexdale. I'll be back whenever the craving hits me."}
