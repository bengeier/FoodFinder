{"text":"This is an airport place so I wasn't expecting much. My burger was over cooked and the bun was too big for the patty. The food got to us pretty fast though and fries were satisfactory. I would've gone three stars but the check took forever to get to us. Our waitress seemed busy socializing with customers as we waited. That could be bad if you're waiting for a flight!"}
{"text":"Margaritas tasted like the cheap margarita mix I couldn't stomach even in college. Chips and salsa basket had enough salsa for about a third of the chips, the side of guac we ordered (which was nothing other than packaged mashed avocado) covered another third. The final third of chips we ate dry. Two stars instead of one only because the chips were hot and the food looked sanitary, but I regret spending any money here."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and I'll say that it's pretty consistent...SLOW service. Zombie like employees. Not-my-job attitude with the bar staff. Small selection for beer on tap. I'll give it one star for being the only place open and another for serving beer till 12:30. That's about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Good fries. Horrible service. If you want to miss your flight and be the object of surlyness, come here.

Avoid it."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We waited over half an hour and had to leave without eating or we would miss our plane."}
{"text":"First time to fly out from terminal 2, but what a depressing terminal...

Had one hour left so I decided to eat something at the Copper Plate grill. It was seat yourself - but apparently that also means you need to find your own menu? Took waitresses three go arounds to get me one.

First attempt to deliver me my food went wrong...but getting a waitress attention to get it resolved took some time.
Second attempt was still wrong, but given the fact that I was 50 minutes into the hour I had I gave up and decided to eat it.

Not great - lower end greasy and too much salt.

When I decided to pay, the waitress again was MIA...making it tempting to just leave and board my plane - but since that was not how I was raised I walked over to the POS and paid....

Never again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, particularly for post-security in a tiny, backwater terminal (oh, come on...) Burger patties easily 1/3 pound; the double is quite the mouthful. Service was cheerful and prompt. If I'm every back at PHX Terminal 2, this is where I'll likely eat."}
{"text":"In terminal 2 at 11pm on a Tuesday night, this was one of the few places open. Took a chance, and was delighted with the service. Barbra was taking orders and running drinks and meals. Had the copper dog and was surprised how good it was. My son had chicken finger kids meal and the fries had a sprinkle of parsley on them. Not bad presentation for a kids meal. Overall if your options are limited and have an hour to kill, this place can accommodate and it was reasonably priced. Family of 3 walked out with $25 of course we just ordered water as our drinks."}
{"text":"I give it a one reluctantly...because there is no zero. I travel. A lot. I have been in nearly every mid to major airport in the country and several one flight a day operations. And this, bar none, is the worst. I cringe at the thought of flying out of Phoenix. 

The bartender has zip zilch nada personality and makes you feel like you are a hassle. I was hoping for a bristley Sam Elliot or Karen McCluskey type from this leathery character, but nothing. The lady next to me and I are having a great laugh about it, but Damn. She was here last time I was here. I didn't review because, I like second chances in general. Take a look at my reviews. Most are positive.

Sadly it is the only bar in terminal 2. On my next visit I will drop off at terminal 3 or 4, hopefully have a better ....
Wait!

Someone just asked here if she could turn to the game. Yup. Rude to her too. 

...anyway... I will crawl along the hot sidewalk in 100+ degrees of Arizona summer from those terminals to 2 just avoid this place. For now though, I'll just sit here and drink this luke warm beer and eat this surprisingly decent brat with not surprisingly sawdust textured fries until United let's me carry my miserable ass on board....let's hope they are on time...for once.

Note: I won't post this until I leave in hopes things turn around. If you're reading this.... Oh well.

Oh well? Well...I just watched her clean out the sink trap and it's gunk, not wash her hands, then grab a couple of glasses and fill with luke warm beer for us sheep. For the record. Germs don't phase me. I switched to vodka just in case.

A super nice fella... polite like your great uncle at church...sat down, asked about a salad, received his abuse, asked about wifi, received his abuse, and then cowered at the possibility of asking for anything else. No worries. I helped him into the free PHX wifi after the dismay faded from his face.

To be continued?"}
{"text":"The burger/fries was very unappetizing. Water from tray spilled onto floor. Poor cleanup. 
It's located in the United terminal and there's nothing around so no choice."}
{"text":"Don't eat breakfast here. The coffee is undrinkable, they use fast food hash browns and what taste like powdered eggs. Yuck. And it's pricey. Especially for what they are serving."}
{"text":"Service was quick! First flight out of the airport early Christmas Eve morning. I was hungry and ran over to this establishment while the flight was boarding hoping to grab something prepare. The server could see I was rushed and handed me a menu. I explained I don't have time to wait and she said to pick out a breakfast item and she could have it prepared in less then 5 minutes. I ordered the turkey sausage breakfast sandwich. Boom! Here comes my meal four minutes later. I ran back to board the plane with a little time to spare. The sandwich was pretty good and better then anything I expected on such short notice. In all my traveling experiences with last minute grub at the airport this was the best. This put the wildflower l bread company to shame. This place seems to get it. They also have a bar if you have more time. Good place to grab breakfast before a flight or enjoy a sit down meal of you have time to spend. For an airport breakfast joint I am impressed. Four stars mostly for the service and promptness."}
{"text":"Not much more to say.  It is closest to the Alaska gates and when u need a drink this is the place."}
{"text":"Places was excellent. My waiter seemed a little off but she was amazing. Like Lenny from Mice and Men. Ordered a double jack and coke which was delicious. The chili burger was darn tasty too."}
{"text":"The service is great. Great way to start your morning here before your flight. Had their chicken burger and side of chile chowder soup. Both items were really good."}
{"text":"No shakes at first, which made us super sad because the menu boasts premium ice cream for the shakes. Burgers run $9-$10 each plus fries, sweet potato fries, salad or soup. My daughter and I both ordered burgers as recommended by another Yelper. I got the Chipotle Bacon Burger. My daughter got the Green Chili Burger. I got SP fries and she got regular fries. The green chile burger was perfectly balanced in texture and flavor. Savoy roasted green chiles with creamy avocado balanced a slightly dry burger on a toasted bun. The Chipotle burger was okay with another slightly dry patty. Fries were okay. Large portions. Waitress,  Barbara was awesome. Kitchen messed up order so she brought out the sweet potato fries later. We had extra fries. Service was fast and happily, that was different from other reviews. We ordered a root beer float later when we saw a shake come out. Yummy. Good stuff. We dined for an hour."}
{"text":"Solid airport restaurant. Service was great. Deliver prompt, and food better than expected. These guys really know how to do fries, especially sweet potato!  Crispy outside and creamy inside. Highly recommend. 

I saw most of the negative reviews were from the bar. I sat at a table and didn't have any issues."}
{"text":"A pleasant enough place in the airport to grab a burger and beer before a flight. Outside of the airport, I would not recommend this place outside of the airport. It wasn't the worst but to easy to find a better burger. The service was good and staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"Located near gate 7 in terminal 2, united terminal. Decent soup, burgers with soup, salad, or regular or sweet potato fries. The service, my waitress was Barbara, was good and pretty fast. They have tvs and a full bar."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Good Morning \" breakfast after waiting for 15 minutes (they were not that busy) for $11.00. Ten minutes later I get a plate with dry eggs, a McDonald's hash brown,  a dry piece of turkey sausage, and stale toast. Ate some of the eggs and that was it. $13.66 for this and a cup of coffee.....will never return"}
{"text":"If zero was an option it would be a zero not a one.  Very rude I don't know know how the old woman that is a waitress even has a job working with people...walking down to the Wendy's to get real service and that is a very sad statement."}
{"text":"The older male bar tender this afternoon was horrible. We sat at the bar and watched him pour drink after drink but only pour half shots into a full shot priced drink. He dropped the shot jigger on the floor and then pick it up and reuse it without washing it!! He was rude to people. He needs to go home. When the female bar tender is here things are done right. Very disappointed today."}
{"text":"Terminal 2 is a sad place. Especially when you are waiting for your flight with the Walmart of airlines. The Copper Plate made my wait tolerable. Hooray for being open past 11! Even serving food till 11:45PM. Just heard the bartender say last call is at 12AM. Time for one more beer! Thanks CP."}
{"text":"Beer = Warm and they are always out of something
Service = lack luster
Food = standard airport unimpressive

The sad thing is, this is the best place in Terminal 2 at the moment"}
{"text":"When I ate here they were full and all the bartenders seemed to be in a bad mood. The waitress explained that they were backed up - so I waited a long time for a menu, for my food and for the correct bill. While waiting the waitress charged one table for their meal and the strangers beside them.  When I finally got my bill ($10 approx) I was instead handed a bill for 31$. She corrected it but that was pretty typical for the experience of everyone there. The bartender charged one woman 9$ for a white wine glass and then gave the next woman who came the exact same glass for 8$ and told her not to tell anyone about the \"inside price\". 
So basically it was not a place for a relaxing easy meal that day. The food was nothing to write home about. 
Personally, I think I'll eat somewhere else next time!"}
{"text":"I had a sandwich and fries.  The bread for the sandwich was wonderful, very soft and moist.  The seasoned fries were very good.  It being an airport restaurant, I expected a lot less."}
{"text":"Must have hit it on a good day.  Service was friendly and good.  Chef's salad, although not large, was fresh.  Burger and fries only ok, and also not large portions.  Bloody Mary was adequate.  I've had worse experiences in other airports."}
{"text":"The most rude service my wife and I have ever had. One of the waitresses was babbling and whining in Spanish to her coworker, complaining loudly during the few minutes we suffered in this establishment. She slammed chairs, menus, and any other items she could lay her hands on. She acted as though we were interrupting her complaint session when she took our order. After she took our orders and snatched our menus from our hands, we decided it was too scary and anxiety producing to eat there. We paid for the coffee she had grudgingly served us and left. The wait staff at this place either needs therapy or a career change."}
{"text":"If I could give less than a star, I would. The United terminal at Phoenix airport is a disaster, and we were looking for somewhere to get a sit-down breakfast. Typically I look at Yelp reviews first, and I should have, because a grab and go muffin would have been better than this shitshow. 
The service was the worst I have seen - the waitress who seemed highly angry with the fact that we came in to the restaurant literally slammed down menus, water glasses (mine had a bug in it), and the yogurt/bagel that we ordered out of fear (after reading Yelp reviews once seated) that the service would be so slow we'd miss our plane. 
Everything seemed dirty, and the servers all seemed to have no concept of how to treat customers or take pride in anything they were doing. 
This was the first time in my life that I was tempted to not leave any tip at all (my conscience got the best of me), but in hindsight, I shouldn't have. Avoid this at all costs and just grab a muffin from the Coffee Bean. Not worth the hassle, not worth feeling like you did something wrong by sitting down somewhere. 
Absolutely the worst. The owner/management should really be ashamed."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service. When we sat down to a dirty table and the server made no effort to wipe the table, we should have left. Drinks then came filled halfway. Server then seemed to dissuade us from eating by suggesting 'drinks only.' Eat here if you want food that doesn't match the menu and a server that talks like she's chewing her face. This place is horrible. Someone call Chester Pierce to analyze micro aggression theory here."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service.  We sat at our table for over 20 minutes before even being acknowledged.   Had their soup which was good and chicken sandwich which was dry."}
{"text":"Not much choice in this terminal but anything would have been better.   Asked for water and iced tea.  I got the tea. Never saw any water.  My food was literally dropped at my table with zero check ins after.  The tea was gone by the time my food came and I never saw anyone to get a refill.  So ate food with nothing to drink then sat there waiting almost 20 minutes to get my check.  

The food- small burger on a huge thick heavy bun.  Green chili and avocado topping was good.  Best part of the meal.  

Won't eat there again when I'm flying through."}
{"text":"Very slow service.servers unaware.two separate people walked in and served coffee before I got a menu. Order taken without a word from the server.breakfast sandwich mediocre at best. Will wait in line at Wendy's next time."}
{"text":"SLow bartenders, slow staff, mushy food.  I'm sure they don't care as there is no competition in that concourse and $$$ rolls in hand over fist from corporate card charges, but ugh..."}
{"text":"It's no wonder this place is two stars. We waited for ten minutes until I finally got up and got our own menus. Which a snarky server said \"yea- be right over.\" Um.. another ten minutes went by and still no one to take our order. After waiting for over 20 minutes- we decided to just bail- afterall we are flying and needed to board our flight. My suggestion- don't eat here-- better off doing the Starbucks thing and waiting in that never ending line than just getting ignored."}
{"text":"Super mediocre food and very slow service. It took the grill 30 minutes for the most basic burger on earth and my beer was kind of warm. Only eat here if you don't care about money, time or quality. 

It's one thing to have slow service. It's another to try and woof down your food 5 minutes before you board, when you got there 45 minutes before your flight, and the waiter placate you and tell you it isnt actually boarding yet. Yuck."}
{"text":"Had pretty bad service. I understand it's near the end of the day, I'm sure the staff has been here all day, but I received no friendliness from the waitress. They messed up the order, she forgot to put in one of our meals, the. We had to wait quite a long time to finally pay, and she didn't even properly ring up the price. Extremely disappointed. Food was average nothing great, fine for the price"}
{"text":"I think it is important that you know about the restaurant experience I had on Sunday while traveling through the airport, at Copper Plate Grill, Terminal 2. Before I start, I tend to give restaurant employees the benefit of the doubt and leniency when they are busy, as I worked in this industry for 10+ years. But this was unacceptable and must at least be known to you.

My boyfriend and I showed up right around 11am at sat at an empty table (no host staff at podium, no signage on whether to sit or wait to be seated). They were very busy, but we sat at a clean, empty table, and looked at the menu already there. The menu said breakfast ended at 11am, so we decided to order lunch. At around 11:07am, a server (Barbara) came up to us and asked how we were. We said, fine, and asked her the same. She said, \"wherever you're going, take me with you.\" We nervously chuckled, and said we were ready to order. My boyfriend ordered an iced tea and a burger. As he ordered the burger, she said it was still breakfast and he couldn't order it. We informed her it was after 11. She got her phone out, looked at the time, and said, \"I have to ask,\" and walked away. We were a little confused, but figured she was coming right back after asking another employee. She didn't come back for another 6 minutes, and we watched her wandering around doing other things. I finally caught her eye and said excuse me. She looked at me and said, \"it is lunch time,\" and walked away. I was then getting annoyed. She finally came back at 11:15, grabbed the menu from the table, and started to walk away. Both my boyfriend and I said, we haven't ordered lunch yet. She then said, oh yes, what would you like? He again ordered a burger and iced tea, I then ordered the chicken strips and fries with a Diet Coke. She didn't write anything down, and asked what we wanted to drink. 

At this point I was very frustrated. It only got worse when about 5 minutes later, she walked up to me (way past when she should have had the order in, and frankly the food should have been about to come out of the kitchen), and said, you ordered chicken strips, right? I said yes, and she walked away. At this point it was approximately 11:35. Five or so minutes later, she came back out with one food basket...the burger. She said to me, \"the chicken strips take a little longer.\" And, my boyfriend's burger had clearly been sitting in the window as the burger and fries were cold and the bun was as hard as a rock. That is when I went up to her at the register where she was and told her to forget the chicken strips and just give me the check for the burger and drinks. We paid $15.24 without eating any food, and left.

I would understand if the kitchen or the entire restaurant were having troubles this morning, but they weren't. There was another server there that waited on a table which sat down 30 seconds in front of us in her station. They had beers, food, and more beers by the time we ordered our lunch. The service we received was terrible, and on top of it, this was at an airport, where you do have an expectation that the staff understands you are under time constraints. 

I usually don't comment, but I am a frequent flyer to this airport and into Terminal 2, and would hope that this type of service would be addressed so that no traveler has to endure the poor level of service we received this past Sunday. Thank you for listening."}
{"text":"If nothing else is open, this place is acceptable. The food was edible, and my drink was stronger than one would accept for an overpriced airport bar. My burger was over cooked and dry, and the seasoned fries definitely didn't have any seasoning. Drinks are the saving grace. We arrived before the lunch rush and had fine service, but it seemed slower for the main lunch crowd as we were leaving. If I ever eat in terminal 2 again, I'll go to Wendy's. It's probably similar in price and quality. If you are dying for a drink, the margarita I had was made with store bought mix. Not amazing, but the bartender has a heavy hand. I always appreciate a good pour when I need a drink."}
{"text":"Solid sit-down choice in terminal 2.  Good food, great fries, friendly and efficient service, nice bar.  Would definitely come here again if in the area.  Many more choices in terminal 4."}
{"text":"Atrociously horrible service. Captive audience with few choices. So they don't have to care. Which they clearly do not. 

Oh. And the food sucks."}
{"text":"They want to be that hole in the wall dinner with crappy but signature food but they're more like eating food that your friends' mom prepared and she can't cook. The fries were just ok. The sandwich had a lot of mayo, a lot of box lettuce, surprisingly thick tomatoes, two really thin slices of meat from a store deli box and an even tinier slice cheese. It came pretty quick and the service was just ok. I give it a solid 2.5..."}
{"text":"Whoa! This was a bad restaurant experience. I guess the burgers are the way to go. I had a chopped salad that I would describe as sad. I also ordered an old fashioned and couldn't drink it after one sip. How can you mess up an old fashioned? The place was crowded because it is the only real restaurant by these gates. I felt bad for Lorna, my server. She was rushing around all over the place. There were only two servers for a very crowed place. Not fair to them. Still she dropped off my drink and food and I haven't seen her since. I just want to pay and get out of here. 

When it was time to go, it was nice that Lorna agreed to take the drink off the bill."}
{"text":"Stopped for a drink and quick but before my flight. Bill arrived, showing \"rocks\" x2. Asked for an explanation, was told this charge was for the ice in my drinks!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken sandwich....I've never eaten a wrestling mat before bit I'm guessing would have same consistency of the chicken.  One of if not the worst sandwich I have ever had."}
{"text":"Terrible service! The bartender guy is always terribly slow and unattentive. Today he said they don't open at 6am normal time that everyone else in this airport follows but instead at \"6am airport time\"... I fly multiple times a week and have never known the airport to run on a different clock than the rest of the world! I'll never be stopping at this place for their mediocre food and warm drinks again. PHX needs to replace you in T2!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly at the bar
Hard to find a seat....you gotta be quick on those busy days!
Sports playing on the TVs
OK menu....it's nothing great but they had some good looking options at least. 
I opted for what I thought would be the easiest/quickest menu item; chicken strips...they forgot my order...actually they forgot I ordered it and sent it back. Took another 10 minutes to receive. They also didn't come out as described on the menu but were your basic pre-frozen fried foods. Good enough. 
Plenty of decent beers on tap...be specific when ordering as they will automatically give you the large beer which is around $9.50!"}
{"text":"The food was nothing to brag about.  But when a restaurant says that they have great service, they should offer it.  The bartender was swearing. The server was not attentive. The servers looked like they hated to be there. No smiles. Eat before you get to terminal 2 or this restaurant."}
