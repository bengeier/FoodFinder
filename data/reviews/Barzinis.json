{"text":"Food was nothing amazing. It wasn't bad but it wast great. While the staff was nice felt like they were trying to rush us out of there."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, good food and chefs! Gotta love an Italian and not super vegg friendly joint that was more than happy to accommodate my mostly vegan lifestyle. I ordered the Chicken Barzini Salad sans chicken of course!  They made me an awesome salad loaded with roasted julienned veggies. And man those bread rolls, (I seriously couldn't resist them) and um $4 house wine that was good in addition to cheap, count me in!!   Def be back here again when I am in Az!"}
{"text":"We waited an hour and half for pizza delivery. We even ended up meeting the delivery guy out on the street because he couldn't find his way, nor would he stay put for us to find him. He proceeded to overcharge us and could not provide a receipt for our order. The white pizza we ordered was cold and stale, the soda was warm and flat. When we called to notify the manager on duty about the service, he was cordial, apologized and promised to send us a couple free pizzas for the trouble.   When we called the next day regarding the condolence pizzas, the manager was busy and unable to front the offer, however the nice employee on the phone offered some pasta instead. So we ordered another popular pizza in addition, and the nice employee who took our order promptly delivered the food. We were appreciative for the improvement in service, but the food was underwhelming. At least we gave them a second chance."}
{"text":"Picked up the chicken parmesan sub/hero on saturday night for 8 bucks and then added a cup of minestrone soup for $1.50. I liked the soup because it had a nice peppery taste and was loaded with various beans and veggies that most of that type of soup contains. The cutlets for the chicken were really good as well and it had a good amount of mozzarella cheese. Only improvement could be the roll which was average (soft) if you didn't reheat it, but it wasn't an Italian roll, so it didn't reheat well and was flaky, like my date that night. One staff guy was very enthusiastic, but the pizza looked miserable on the way out and overall the prices are a few bucks too much for a college town restaurant. The chicken parm dinner would have been 12 bucks and that did not include the standard salad."}
{"text":"Awesome little joint. Staff is what makes it. Reminds me of a small pizza place in Brooklyn and the pizza never disappoints. The cowboy cookies blow my mind every time."}
{"text":"Salty, pasty, sauce, overcooked pasta mush, frozen eggplant fried poorly. The best part was the cheese. Everyone acted like they cared that I ate only 2 bites of my food, but nobody did anything about it. Saw the open sign on last night thought I'd try again,  door locked. Bad look."}
{"text":"The food far outpaces the looks of the establishment. You won't be disappointed with the food - we weren't.  Eight of us walked in Friday night and it was pretty open... not sure the word is out yet about this place. They bring menus to the table but you need to walk to the counter to order and pay. They do however bring you your food, but drink refills seem to still be on you. I didn't tip when I paid for my food... wasn't sure if I was supposed to? I probably should have.. :/ next time.   I had the garlic bread side and the Tortellini Nonna entre. Very satisfied with both and I'd definitely order them again.  Buddy had the Antipasto and others had spaghetti, chicken parm, chicken barzini and one of the pizza's. Everybody, including my Italian friend from Jersey was really happy with their food and we all mentioned how we're definitely putting it into the rotation.   The people working were very nice and happy. The menu font and color bothered me though... dark green heavy cursive font on a black background... just not really easy to read. And the menu had an error with the hours on the front... evidently from Thursday to Saturday they're only open from 11pm to 12pm. lol. oops.   Anyways... great food!!"}
{"text":"Well I just tried Barzini's for the first time. I ordered it delivered through Grub Hub. Although it was a little late getting here the driver apologized right up front and then gave me 6 fresh yummy cookies to make up for the lateness in the delivery. :)   Well I tasted the food and the garlic bread with the marinara sauce was DELIGHTFUL.!!!!!! The salad with olive oil /balsamic vinegar was GREAT...Now for the eggplant parm. I was a little disappointed. The eggplant appeared to be very oily, I really don't believe it was fresh either, possibly frozen. The good thing is everything was very hot .  I think next time I will try something different.  But \"A\" for excellent customer service and for the food being hot, which is sometimes an issue for delivery service.   Thanks to the driver for the yummy cookies :)"}
{"text":"Being a connoisseur of spaghetti, I am always looking to try new recipes. Although  initially hesitant to try Barzinis, I decided to give them a shot. And boy, was I pleasantly surprised. Their spaghetti and meatballs is comparable to restaurant recipes I've tried in the past. And for such a great price, it's hard to pass up. Once I learned that they deliver, I was sold. It has now become my favorite go to spot for spaghetti when I am too lazy to prepare my own and I don't feel like spending $15-$20 on one entree. I highly recommend trying this locally owned spot. You may be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"That's Italian!  It's difficult to find a really good Italian restaurant in the Valley.  This is probably one of things that has hit me the hardest about moving out here from San Francisco--I went from a place where great Italian cuisine abounds, to a place where the great ones are like landmarks on barren terrain.  Barzini's is one of those landmarks.  The greatest outrage of them all that you will see at one of the inferior joints is what I refer to as the \"Italian Scam\"--this is when you get a few cups of pasta or 5 ravioli in a low-grade tomato or other sauce and they charge you $15-$20.  It's noodles and sauce.  The noodles are off the shelf, and the ingredients in the sauce (if it isn't canned or jarred) are mixed from supermarket ingredients.  Even if it's Nonna's recipe that she took with her when she came over from Tuscany or Palermo in 1902, that doesn't give anybody clearance to charge a customer that much for a simple dish.  There are no scams at Barzini's.  The pasta plates are a decent size, for a decent price, and the taste is superior.  My daughter loved her cheese ravioli--and she's picky about quality.  My wife's tortellini was redolent with peas and a tomato cream sauce--it actually resembled an Indian red curry dish at first appearance.  However, its taste and aroma was all Italian--my wife was all smiles.  A lot of love goes into the preparation here and you get your food with friendly, helpful service.  The pizza that they serve reminds me somewhat of the incredible pie that I ate when I visited Naples with my father back in 2004--yes, this is a spot for authentic taste.  They even have extremely fresh vegetarian, vegan, and non-gluten options if that's what you're looking for.  May I recommend the Rigatoni Primavera?  It ain't a fancy, dress-up establishment.  Barzini's is a simple, walk-in place where all you have to do is go to the counter, order, and have a seat.  They deliver too--yet another reason to set your Italian food compass to this landmark, and keep coming back."}
{"text":"Ok for those of you who know me and my reviews, this might surprise you.  Everyone knows that I am very loyal to Spinatos but this place gives them a run for their money. When I find a new place to blog about  I always order two days in a row because consistency is key. In that regard I would give a 10 out of 10. In fact, the owner delivered my food personally today just to thank me for the positive review (you can't ask for better customer service).  I was so embarrassed that my house and appearance were such a mess due to working non stop, but I very much appreciated the personal touch.  No the food is not cheap but it is fresh and well made so its worth it.  The sauce is flavorful, the chicken is tender and the pasta is aldente. Oh and the fresh baked cookies, don't get me started.  I can't wait to try the pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Very good! Have ordered from here a few times. I normally order the chicken parm sandwich with the onion strings. The strings remind me of the ones at Outback. My friend loves the vodka penne, Should give this place a try if you haven't"}
{"text":"Stopped into Barzini's for lunch. Two large-screen TVs, a clean interior with new furniture, and a nice picture of a NYC market with the same name. Too bad the food was not as good as the look.  I figured the antipasto was a safe bet, but it was basically a pile of iceberg lettuce with a few scraps of meat and cheese. I was hoping for some artichoke hearts or at least 1-2 pepperoncini to brighten it up.  When I asked for pepperoncini, the staff exchanged puzzled looks, then came back with some sliced green peppers. I was told they had to make a special run to the store for these, so I felt a bit guilty - as these guys were obviously trying hard - but c'mon, what kind of Italian restaurant has never heard of pepperoncini?    We also ordered pizza by the slice. It tasted like the crust was pre-baked with the cheese and toppings added later and re-heated. Very light on tomato sauce and not very authentic.  Cafeteria at best.  Barzini's might pass for Italian in Phoenix, but if you're an Italian food lover you'll probably be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is possibly going to be my new regular Go-To for pizza delivery. They have so far been consistent and friendly and timely. The food is pretty excellent for a local delivery pizza place. I'm not ready to call it my favorite pizza place yet or anything, but it's definitely up there.   The location used to be another pizza place ages ago that closed down and was empty for awhile. It has since been remodeled and the food is nothing like what it used to be... aside from being pizza of course. Anyway, throw all preconceptions out the door and go enjoy a slice.   You could probably find cheaper in the area, but the food here is good quality and fresh with lots of flavor. I've been impressed with it every time. In fact I just ordered dinner."}
