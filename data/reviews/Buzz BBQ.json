{"text":"Was in there for lunch last week.  FABULOUS!  Waiter told me the Tropicana location will soon be closing, sometime in Feb 13.  Get there and enjoy it while you can!"}
{"text":"Not very good. Ribs  were really fatty and could have used more time on the grill. I barbecue ribs and  and know what it takes to make good ribs. Slow and low is the key. I ordered the ribs as attest to see if they had a clue, and they came up short. The sides were boing and bland,and the service was not great."}
{"text":"DISUSTING!!! It was absolutely disgusting. I have been there 3 times and it got progressively worse each time I went. If they are closed I can see why.  The staff is really nice and that part is great, but they are terrible servers. I appreciate that they were nice, but come on. Our food was AT BEST just warm. I couldn't even get the food down, it was so gross. HORRIBLE!!! I understand one bad time, but like I said it got progressively more disgusting each time I went."}
{"text":"TAKE A PASS---Buzz started off great and deteriorated.  We took out tonight and had very dry (pot roast) brisket w/out sauce.  I specifically asked about sauce and the server proudly stated it's in a container served on the side.  This is the forth time we have eaten Buzz BBQ and each time we left more and more disappointed but continue to give them the benefit of the doubt for we love BBQ and have limited offerings in LV.   If we were dining in we would have certainly sent the brisket back, it should not have been served.  I'd love to know how long ago it left the smoker.  It was truly beyond dry.  The chicken was OK but the rib tips were also dry and I'm not sure they have anything to do with any section of the rib.    The mac/cheese was watered down with a very spicy white pepper bite.  To make matters worse, when I called and complained I was asked if I wanted to drive back and pick up some sauce--REALLY.  I was told they would keep my name by the register and give us a free meat and side when we returned rather than credit back to my charge a portion of this bad meal. We'll use this $25 meal as a learning experience."}
{"text":"2 eat for $20 is one of the best deals for a great BBQ meal in the Valley.  They  have the best brisket I've had outside of Texas.  Came to find out the pitmaster is from Oklahoma, and has won awards for his brisket.  The ribs, sausage, and pulled pork are spot on too."}
{"text":"It is likely that any of the poor reviews they have gotten, occurred long before they tweaked it into the experience I just had, or they just had an off day. And believe me I don't let anyone get away with mediocrity in my reviews and I'm somewhat of a culinary snob. It also may be that so many places in Vegas are really bad and that I've become so accustomed to this, that when someone does something decent, it seems better than it really is. However I do believe that Buzz BBQ is definitely on the right track and doing it very, very well. This is everything one should expect from a BBQ restaurant! Meats that involve flavor steps, such as brining, marinades, spice rubs and most importantly low, slow and smoky cooking with wood and or coal. Side dishes that compliment the richness of authentic BBQ, opposed to going to war with it. These people obviously have a passion for and take pride in what they are doing. There are quite a number of places in Las Vegas that fall so short of this it's appalling. As I mention in most of my reviews, baking & or boiling meat and then putting BBQ sauce on it does not make it BBQ and anyone who does this has no business calling it such. What these guys do is fantastic. Brisket that's sliced thick, but still tender enough to cut with a fork. Ribs that are brined, flavorful and extremely tender that come close to, but do not actually fall off the bone (this is not easily achieved by most people). Chicken that even has breast meat that retains juiciness as the result of brining and not overcooking. Meat with a notable \"smoke ring\" resulting in true BBQ flavor which tells you that the people making this food, actually know what it is that defines the style. Beans, Rice, Macaroni and potato salad etc. some of which they might actually prepare, instead of opening a can, putting it in a container and charging you for doing that. Thank you Buzz BBQ for contributing to the positive side of the normally uninspired void of local food culture. Thank you for creating an experience for people, that will leave them well educated and with a proper understanding of what BBQ is, instead of robbing them of it. I should also mention, great location, great environment, friendly, knowledgeable staff, fast service and the story goes on. Three Thumbs Up!!"}
{"text":"Well I wish I had read the reviews first before dining here, it would have saved me a trip and money. This place is nothing but a low class, low quality hole in the wall. The food was nothing less of a microwaved, over dry meal. You can tell they buy low quality meats and ingredients to save a buck and you can see that they microwave their food a few times because people are definitely not eating there. Then to top it all off the owner came out before we payed our check and commented on how we barely ate anything, I didn't want to make a stink so I kept my thoughts to myself. We had a groupon because an old one of mine from Memphis BBQ expired and I had to redeem it for a new one at another restaurant, so I figured we would try Buzz BBQ. When it was time to pay the check, the server tried to write in a gratuity of 18% stating that groupon required it. I asked to see the groupon and nowhere on the paper did it say that I had to leave 18%. She argued, the owner came out and was upset with us because he pays a good amount towards groupon and they should require 18%. That's not my fault, as it is I'm stuck paying for terrible food that I barely ate and now you want 18% for a sever that was maybe average. He continued to argue with me about how great his food is which is completely unprofessional and that he was BEST OF LAS VEGAS. Well here is a little piece of advice, when you serve low quality food to the public they will not be returning. Gordon Ramsay would have tore this s*%t hole apart!"}
{"text":"Got some ribs from here a few weeks ago and was very disappointed.  The place came highly recommended and did not come close to delivering.  Meal deals are priced way to high for the quality of the product.  Would not go back..."}
{"text":"Probably should be renamed to Bust BBQ. This place is no good. I was looking forward to it because of all of the great reviews, but obviously those people eat McDonalds on a regular basis and they're judging this place on the McRib.  When I think of BBQ places I think first off, the sauce has to be good enough to drink. I made the mistake of trying the sauce before I got my food. Eww.  The ribs and tips were really fatty, which would be okay if they tasted good, but they didn't. Everything was waaaaayy to smokey.    The sides were mediocre at best and the rolls were terrible.  I was shocked that cornbread wasn't even on the menu. The only option is stale Hawaiian rolls.  If you have ever been to a great BBQ place, i.e. in Texas or Dinosaur BBQ, then you will majorly disappointed.  I was sick the whole night and next day after I ate there.  My suggestion, is get a steak, lather it with some store bought BBQ sauce and grill it yourself.  This place is TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"This place is a great find.  I had the pulled pork, ribs and rib tips.  Each had a great flavor and the bbq sauce has a nice deep flavor with a little kick.  You can smell the place within 500 yds.  Very difficult to stay away."}
{"text":"I couldn't stay away...I ate here again.  Gluttony: 1 Me: 0  The update is that the collards are ok, but not that great.  The coleslaw was \"Cold Water Coleslaw\"...I had never heard of this before.  My co-workers were sad that this place didn't serve beer.  The waiter said that they have a pending license."}
{"text":"I'd really like to give this a 2-1/2 star rating.  We have only been at the Buzz\"s on Craig Road (started on Ann Road a few years ago) and fell in love with their smoked chicken.  Very smoky and so tender.  Ribs and brisket are OK, too, but I like Famous Dave's better.  And we didn't like any of their sides.  When we get our meat at Buzz's we go across the parking lot to Popeye's and get fries and rice and beans.  We've never eaten in the restaurant, but have only had take-out.  Don't remember the decor as being memorable.  Haven't been there for awhile, and don't remember that they had sweet potato fries or cobbler the last time we were there.  We'll have to give those a try the next time we crave the smoked chicken!"}
{"text":"Meats were ok, sides were average or all around miss, small to medium portions.  Came all the way out to use a restaurant.com cert that they didnt accept."}
{"text":"My 1st time here. Take out. Great friendly service and only about 5-6 min wait. All food was great and Would have got 5 stars but they Forgot my Rolls!! Boooo!  I will be back though."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife after reading very positive reviews in the Internet and the local news paper.  May be our expectations were too high, but after tasting their food, we were kinda disappointed.  The decor and the service remind us a fast-food stand.  The meat was dry and way too smoky that stacked in our mouths for long hours after.  I understand that for some people  this is the ultimate BBQ taste, but not for us."}
{"text":"First, I will say that the food is good.  If you're looking for quality BBQ and decent-sized portions, this is a good place to get some food.  My wife thought the meat had too much of a smokey taste to it, but I thought it was just right.  Despite the good food, I will not be going back nor will I be recommending this place to anyone.  I purchased a $15 for $25 coupon from Yelp and on my first attempt to use it was rudely informed by the person at the register that I had to have it printed out.  Despite the fact that it specifically says you do NOT have to print it out.  I ended up having to pay out of pocket the full price as I did not feel like driving back home 15 minutes away to print out the coupon.  Then the next time I went back we brought our printed out coupon, but the service was just as lacking.  The waitress was slow and inattentive, and again expressed mild annoyance that we were using a coupon with our order.  The atmosphere is interesting in that it's a big open room with too much open space; it really feels like they're still waiting for more furniture to arrive with how sparse the tables and chairs are.  It's unfortunate that the atmosphere and service is so horrible because like I said it was good food."}
{"text":"Ate here on Wednesday afternoon and stayed behind to chat with the owner, Mike. I had the pulled pork sandwich, ice water cole slaw, beans, mac n cheese, and a baked apple dessert with fresh, home-made ice cream.  Everything came out quickly and I dug into the sides first. I found both the mac n cheese and the baked beans to be 4-star quality. They weren't the best I've ever had but they certainly didn't deserve the low ratings others have given here in years past.  Although I'm from Tennessee and like my cole slaw to be mayo-based, I found the ice water cole slaw (vinegar based) to be very interesting. Put it on the pulled pork sandwich and enjoyed it thoroughly. The pork was tender and juicy and while it isn't exactly \"Memphis style\" the way I really prefer it, it did the job and I'll definitely order it again soon.  The apple/ice cream dish was fantastic and perhaps the highlight of the meal. Total damage was about $18.00 (I had no coupons or anything).  All in all I enjoyed myself and I'll be going back. I would suggest that reviewers that had a disappointing time give it another shot. Mike seems like the kind of guy that would do what he could to address your issues to the best of his ability."}
{"text":"Great friendly service.  Food good, with very lrge portions.  Even a side salad was large enough for a meal if you are not too hungry.  Used a coupon downloaded onto smart phone.  Was told it could be used for a meal at the Buzz.  The download had the id number and even a \"delete when used\" bar.  We were told thwt we could not use it, as they needed a printed coupon for payment, not a very modern concept.  But when we were told \"Buzz\" that we should be able to usse the download, he agreed to take the amount off our bill.  I was very impressed by that!  I later checked the site, and indeed the download was useable from the smart device.  Anyway we were very happy with our meal and atmosphere and feel 5 stars is a fair assessment for Buzz BBQ.    Chicken Ceasar Salad was huge. with lots of yummy smoked chicken.  Dressing not too oily and croutons very crispy.  I loved the coleslaw...used it as a topping on my side salad!  it was very tasty and tangy with the vinegar rather than mayo mix.  If I lived locally I would return to the Buzz!  thanks fir a funa nite."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pulled Pork. It was missing the smoke but the meat was tender."}
{"text":"My wife and I are BBQ experts, having sampled BBQ all over the country and Buzz is surely the best in Las Vegas by far. I would also have to say that it ranks right up there with everything we have ever had - anywhere.  This will be a regular spot :)"}
{"text":"booooo! Came here last night. They DO NOT offer the 2 for $20 deal anymore!! I got the pulled chicken sandwich this time. It was awful. They must not be making good money, because the quality went way down. No more Buzz BBQ for me..."}
{"text":"Update 2/16/09:  Buzz BBQ moved to Craig and the 95:  7121 W. Craig Rd #101  It also looks like they've expanded their menu to include catfish and other sides.  I didn't have a chance to go back yet, but plan to soon!"}
{"text":"On vacation in Las Vegas, I read reviews for this restaurant and decided to check it out. OMG!!! Loved the brisket and the ribs!! Service was excellent. The waiter was fast and entertaining!! THE BEST BLACKBERRY COBBLER I EVER ATE!!! Another regular also said the catfish is excellent. I will try that on my next visit. . .  When I return to Vegas--I will definitely eat at Buzz again--way better than the casino fare!! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The ribs were amazing and the vinegar-based coleslaw is delicious. However the atmosphere is nothing special and the service is a bit inconsistent. But when I want BBQ, this is the place!"}
{"text":"So I had lunch there today and was really happy with what I got to eat.  First off, they have the smoker on the outdoor patio so you can smell the goodness when you're walking in, which is saying something considering In-N-Out burger is next door.  I had the 3 meat combo with pulled pork, ribs, and brisket, which the guy behind the bar told me I needed to get.  The ribs were simply superb, good bark, good smoke ring, excellent flavor, and the meat just fell right off the bone.  You know a rib is cooked perfectly when you can pull the bone out without disturbing the meat, and I could and did do this.  The pulled pork was cook also, and was thankfully moist and not dried out like a lot of pulled pork can get if it's shredded early and left sitting around.  Flavor was good, very mild though, added the \"hot\" bbq sauce to spice it up a bit.  The brisket was good too, but I didn't get to eat much of it because I was pigging out on the ribs.  Now on to the sides and sauces.  I ordered the BBQ baked beans, which were quite tasty and bbq-y, and thankfully had no veggies floating around in them, which is the way it should be.  Also had the potato salad, which was fine, I like mine with a kick though, so was happy they had a bottle of Crystal's hot sauce lying around.  The \"mild\" bbq sauce was flavorful and semi-sweet, pretty sure it's got either molasses or brown sugar and ketchup as its base.  The \"hot\" bbq sauce was a little thinner, but still tasty.  It didn't have the heat factor that I thought it would, I would rate it pretty low on the \"heat\" scale, but it did have that little bite that one would expect.  Overall, was quite happy with this place and plan on frequenting it whenever I get the craving for BBQ again."}
{"text":"My fav here in Vegas.  Nice smoky meats that have that dry treatment.  Not like that sweet wet sloppy mess they serve at Dave's.  The $19.99 special for 2 is the best meal deal in Vegas.  You will have leftovers.  You will eat them later in the evening while sitting on the kitchen floor in your underwear."}
{"text":"This review is for the new location on tropicana.  It's been a few years since our last visit to buzz's at the original location on ann rd.  The one thing I remember about buzz' s is that they have some of the best brisket I ever ate . I have had brisket at some of the best BBQ restaurants  in texas(kreutz ,coopers,angelos, salt lick,dwyers, iron works and railhead) tennesee ( neely's , corkys) and buzz' brisket can stand with anybody 's as u can tell i luv bbq, eating it and smoking my own . Well before I go off in a tangent , I can talk BBQ for hours it's a passion of mine, let's get back to buzz's  I had the brisket dinner with fries and collard greens           Im happy to say buzz's hasn't missed a beat still some of the best brisket i ever ate, tender and juicy. Fries and greens were good . BBQ sauce, tomato based  not to sweet a little smokey doesn't overpower the meat . I've probably smoked  about 40 or so briskets in the last 10 years and not once have I come close to what these guys do on a regular bases :( , and my brisket ain't bad at all it's just not great like buzz's . Next time will have the ribs as I can recall those were pretty good too .  Our server stephanie was  very nice."}
{"text":"I like to judge a place by its brisket, and they did NOT disappoint!!! it had a good quarter-inch smoke ring on it, and it was delicious! based on other bbq disappointments around town this could be some of the best bbq in Vegas.  The prices are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Today had the Texas  tornado sandwich (brisket,pulled pork and sausage) side of fried okra . The sandwich is piled high w/ meat . I admit I used a knife and fork to tackle this huge endeavor .  The  meats were tender and juicy like I said on my previous visit  the brisket is one of the best I ever ate      Service always nice and friendly, in fact mike one of the owners came out to ck on things . Second time I've been at this location in a week ,both times mike came out to chat with diners.  My wife enjoyed her brisket sandwich so much , she ordered one for her lunch for the next day, when mike found out he instructed the cook to seperate the bun and meat so it would keep better. Is that service or what, shoot i'm gonna bump um up a star they earned it, 5 stars baby"}
{"text":"I will keep this short and simple. My buddy and I wanted were down there for the World Series of Poker and we wanted some good BBQ. We looked them up on Yelp and decided to go there. We got there about an hour prior to closing and the waitress that helped us out was so awesome... Seriously the best service I have had in years. We got the 2 for $20 and added another meat and side. We got brisket,ribs,chicken and sausage. They were all great but the sausage and brisket stood out the most. The baked beans were so good and so was the homemade ice cream. The food is 4 stars but because the waitress was sooooo good I give it 5! Our bill came out to be about $26 and we left her $45. This is going to be a certain stop whenever I am in Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"Buzz BBQ was recommend to me by a Yelper. It did not disapoint. We had the 3 meat combo which was more than enough for two for lunch. I found everything that we had to be very good and a nice change from the bigger BBQ spots around town. I like that they don't put sauce on their meats. Their is your choice of two bbq sauces on the table, you get that true smoke flavor. And the sweet potato fries are great!"}
{"text":"My honey and I stopped at this place for lunch and was satisfied! The greens awesome, the potato salad awesome, the fish!!!! Awesome! The dinner rolls, hard.... Cornbread muffins is what they need. Peach cobbler and ice cream... Awesome.. there chicken is awesome & the brisket is tender and you know...  awesome lol everything is full of flavor and cooked to perfection! Even the fried okra is awesome! They are awesome... Even there sweet tea and lemonade is awesome... Friendly employees, down to earth owner, and even the chef comes out and speaks to you... This place is awesome. Ps they have Tapitio hot sauce on the tables which I'm not sure why lol however they have red hot in the back if your not feeling the Mexican hot sauce on BBQ (: lol BTW there awesome awesome awesome..."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It has some of the best BBQ in town.  I read some other reviews and I think its funny people give places less stars because they felt a waiter was trying to get them to order.  How about not being rude and being seated at a table for hours waiting on someone else.  I mean the poor guy is paid on tips and if his table is tied up for hours that sucks for him.  I just hope my fellow yelpers have more etiquette than to do that to people.  Anyways enough of my rant, Buzz BBQ is a small place and feels more like a old saloon to me or a picnic place.  I am just reviewing the BBQ though.  It has two different type of bbq sauces one mild one hot.  I dont think any of the sauces are hot but I like the way the mild one tastes.  I usually get the beef brisket which is my favorite its always smoked perfectly and goes great with the mild bbq sauce.  The ribs are great to even though I really dont like ribs.  If you like memphis bbq give this place a try."}
{"text":"buzz's did the catering for my wedding and they were amazing!!! I, like any bride, got a little obsessed with the details but Mike was there to calm me down. They showed up to the wedding early and helped us set up the food and they were nice to everyone that was helping out. I am still getting compliments about the food and we have been married a month now. The night we got engaged, we ate at buzzes so it only seemed perfect to have it at the wedding. Thank you Mike for being apart of our day!!"}
{"text":"Just left Buzz BBQ and I need a nap lol very good portions if you have kids their meals are free with an adult meal so very wallet friendly! We had the pulled pork which was very tender and juicy! Sauce was mediocre and service a little slow but overall it's an alright BBQ joint I'd like to try their smoked turkey for the holidays..."}
{"text":"THE BEST BBQ Around... Hands down!!  Thumbs up!  The BRISKET melts in your mouth.  It is TEXAS style so it is REAL \"Q\"... The ribs literally fall off the bone.  All of the meats are amazing, the sides are fabulous.  The fires, and sweet potato fries are to die for.  I am recommending this place to everyone.  Even out of town folks, And the staff.. They take really really good care of you.  Our Server was ON IT!!  As we noticed so were the others.  The ambiance of this place is just DOWN HOME GOODNESS!"}
{"text":"The only reason I got on here was to give credit where credit is due. Buzz BBQ you taste amazing. Your ribs fall off the bone and your brisket is to die for. I came here 4 times now and all 4 times I had the same waiter who is amazing on his own and always remembers me. I wish I would have seen this yelp thing with the $25 for $15 though. So anyways, the first time I came here on my own and sat at the bar where Jesus (my super cute waiter) told to try the 3 meat combo. I got the brisket, ribs, and pulled pork with some sweet potato fries and some regular fries(p.s. get the sweet fries they are sooooooo good). Now to give credit where credit is due. My super cute waiter who was also my super cute bartender made me the best apple martini and lime margarita I ever had. The other 3 times I went there he asked me if I wanted \"MY\" margarita. The other 3 times I took some of my girlfriends and they agreed that Jesus is the cutest waiter/bartender ever! Girls if you want to have some eye candy with your BBQ this is the place to go.... P.S. Ask for Jesus the super cute LATIN (I forgot to mention he was a hot Latino) waiter/bartender, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this is the worst bbq ive ever had. It shouldnt even be called bbq, it doesnt deserve that title. I dont know where he got those \"Best BBQ\" banners but this place certainly didnt earn them. The service was terrible, unfriendly, and unwelcoming. The place inside feels cold and uninviting with a bad atmosphere. Our server was sarcastic and rude. Now let me talk about there so called bbq. The food had zero flavor, very bland. My ribs and sausage were luke warm at best and were over seasoned with there nasty fake bbq rub. The mac and cheese tasted like it came out of a cardboard box. The baked beans tasted like there were from a can. The dinner rolls were microwaved. My brothers brisket sandwich was DRY and tasted like saw dust. Nothing tasted home made. Dont waste your time and money, you're better off eating at a fast food place because they taste the same (not good). I cook for a living I know what im talking about and I know what good REAL bbq is supposed to taste like, and Buzz BBQ is not it."}
{"text":"Food was decent and so were the prices. The coleslaw was a vinegar slaw, instead of a mayonaise base, which was refreshing. The fries were really good, also. It wasn't super busy, and the service was good. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We found Buzz via a coupon after they first opened, and since then we've forgone all other BBQ places in NW Vegas for them.  They concentrate on the BBQ and they do a great job with it.  Standouts for us are the brisket (you can eat it with just a fork) and the sausage, but you can't go wrong with the ribs, pulled pork, or chicken either.  For sides, the coleslaw is great -- it's not mayo based -- and the baked beans have big chunks of ham in them, as they should!  This is hands-down one of the best BBQ places in town, and certainly the best in NW Vegas."}
{"text":"Authentic & delicious BBQ! My husband's from NC and he is a huge critic when it comes to good southern BBQ and loves it as well. The servings are good-sized portions and you don't need to slather on the BBQ sauce, the flavors speak for themselves in the way it's smoked. The restaurant staff are very nice but it could use a little ambiance :) (it's very quiet in the dinning room) not that it's always a bad thing. Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I am sooo bummed.  After the ROTD on 6/6/2013 I decided to swing by since it had been a while since I had been there.  This was on 6/9 by the way....the sign said it was CLOSED.  I think closed for good because I actually tried calling both locations to verifyand the phone numbers are no longer in service.  Sad to see another local business down."}
{"text":"While waiting at the drive-thru at In-N-Out, I noticed banners over at Buzz advertising a two for $19.99 dinner or $5.99 lunch specials. Mentioned it to the Mister, he suggested we go for dinner. And so we went...  The scent of smoke permeated throughout the restaurant. \"Ahh! We should be in for a treat.\" We were seated in a booth, we ordered pulled pork, andouille sausage and ribs with mac & cheese and sweet potato fries. And let's not forget apple cobbler ala mode for dessert.  The pulled pork was best made into a sandwich with the rolls provided. It's pretty wet and the weakest meat of our trio. The sausage had bold flavor that didn't compete with the smoke. The ribs were the best of the three. Dry rubs generally aren't my preference, but these were good and fall off the bone tender. There was nothing special about the mac & cheese but I liked it. So often you get gummy noodles, but these noodles were tender. The cheese was on the runny side, but I'd rather have that than a globby congealed mess. The sweet potato fries were top notch. Crisp and no added sweeter (I hate when they're sprinkled with sugar). The cobbler was damn good. It was nearly \"lick the bowl clean\" good.  Dinner for two for $25 with drinks is a helluva deal.  We popped over to the bar after dinner for a beer. The Mister relived his youth with Hamm's on tap. No beer flavored water for me. I tried a local brew, Tahoe Blue. Bitter in a good way, I enjoyed it. Our bar tab was $6.50 for two pints. Gotta love that, too."}
{"text":"Been there twice. First time we went had the 2 meat combo. Brisket and ribs. Ribs tender and brisket was fabulous. Nice and juicy. Second time we went, I had the chicken and brisket. Chicken dry, even the dark meat was dry. Brisket extremely dry this time. Nothing like the first time I went. One thing I really hate is dry meat.   For the money we paid, I expect some kick ass meat but was very disappointed in the food and consistency. I will be going elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"It pains me to give this place only 4 stars!  Surely 5 stars is easy when considering the food and the quality, however the price puts me down one.  Although they are a bit expensive; fellow yelpers!  far worht it.  This place has some of the best bbq sauce ever, and their ribs are to die for.  Now as far as ribs go, I am from Chicago which is strickley a baby back town (which Buzz's ribs are not), but my God they made a believer out of me!  They are smoked dry (without sauce) and you can add sauce when it comes out.  Wow!  Thats all I can say.  The full slab is a big portion, you will def have left-overs, but the taste is amazing.  If Jesus Christ ate bbq this would be one of his places, its that good!.  Worth the price, worth the time, you'll thank me for this review!  By the way The beef brisket is second only to Smoke in Chicago, and it's a close race.  Highly recomended, just bring enough money!"}
{"text":"Pros: I really enjoyed the smoked meats here! The GF and I shared a combo plate with brisket, links, and ribs. Nice and tender, well seasoned and good smoke flavor. Plenty of food for the two of us (on a typical day-- catch me on a binge day and I'll eat this by myself, it's that good).  Cons: Their sauce needs some help. But the meats are good without sauce (thankfully, as the sauce they give you on the side didn't really add anything to the taste experience). Both the mac & cheese and bbq beans taste like they came out of a package.  Overall, I really liked this place. And yes, the guys are really nice and are committed to the barbeque craft. Improve the sauce, mac & cheese, and beans; add a banana pudding and they will be over the top!"}
{"text":"Even though I don't eat meat, they have the BEST fries I've ever tasted.   The prices are decent, and the staff is friendly.  Plus, they're always helping the community and that makes me happy. :]"}
{"text":"Smoke em' if ya got em'    The food at Buzz BBQ is smoked, unlike some other BBQ joints in town who grill their goods.  You're not going to get proteins dripping in succulent BBQ sauce here.  What you will get though, is decent food with a noticeably smokey flavor.  The Country style ribs were very good.  They were \"fall off the bone\" tender, and had a good amount of smoke.    The catfish is some of the best I've had in town.  It wasn't too salty or greasy, and really hit that down south spot.  The chicken was forgettable.  Nothing really wrong with it, just nothing really right either.    As far as side dishes go, I liked everything I tried EXCEPT THE MAC N' CHEESE.  It was possibly the worst mac n' cheese I've ever eaten, school lunchrooms and hospital cafes included.    I would go back for the ribs and the catfish for sure.  You should give it a try, your BBQ quota for the month is probably deficient anyways."}
{"text":"I picked up lunch here a few times a month.  I just called for a to go order and the person that answered the phone said they were permanently CLOSED and were breaking down the restaurant.  Craig location is still open."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes and wasn't greeted by anyone...finally caught the attention of the server who in response said hold on a second in a rude way. Was hoping for some good ole bbq, left and went across to in n out instead. Too bad this place lacks customer service..: ("}
{"text":"so hit buzz again last week with 3 buddies that all claim to be bbq experts.  i wasn't too hungry since3 i had a late lunch with the gf - i had the pulled pork and the brisket with  potato salad and baked beans.  the others had the same and ribs, too.  we all agreed - the sauce - regular and hot, sub-par .  the regular is too sweet and not much bite to the hot.    besides my sides, we had the black-eyed peas the collard greens - the collard greens were decent but all the other sides - below average to average.  we all agreed that the beans and the potato salad were,  \"store bought.\"  but the meats - TOP NOTCH !!!  we decided that if we go back, we would bring our own sauce !  still gotta keep it at 4-stars because it's all about the meat ."}
{"text":"Clint's ROTD reminded me i'm not only waaaay behind on posting reviews but especially lax in showing some YELP luv for some of our better local establishments and people...BUZZ DESERVES OUR LOVE !!!  With very limited exception, i've eaten at every BBQ place in our fine Valley - Buzz is the best ...HANDS DOWN !  And people - spare me all the bullshit comparisons to Texas, Kansas City, Memphis, blah blah blah - for crying out loud - we all know Vegas ain't a BBQ mecca but there's still some worthy places ... well... at least one !   My last two visits to Buzz involved a great special they had going ( pic attached )   $20 for 3 meats, 2 sides, rolls, and 2 desserts.    We tried the pulled pork, the ribs, the brisket, links with the sides of mac n cheese , cole slaw, beans, the potato salad and the sweet potato fries.  The meats were all damn good - my fav - THE BRISKET .  the sides - yeah, i gotta admit somewhat average, the slaw is good and the beans, too.  mac n cheese - very boring, but it's all about the MEAT !  But i gotta admit, the blackberry cobbler was a great finish to the meal, a great finish !  Buzz hasn't been too busy the several times i've been there - i'm hoping this place holds on because it is worthy of our love."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place has gotten great reviews. I came here because Someone told me how great it was. I ordered the 3 item combo (ribs, chicken, brisket) and all were pretty darn dry, especially the chicken. So I lathered everything up in sauce which I don't like doing if the BBQ is spot on. Maybe it's an \"off\" Saturday night dinner night"}
{"text":"Real smoked BBQ is what this place is about!  Especially with a Restaurant.com coupon.  The Brisket, ribs and pulled pork are my faves and the sweet potato fries are awesome.  Definitely give Buzz BBQ a try!"}
{"text":"I'm starting to distrust the \"Best in Las Vegas\" more and more with each restaurant I go to.  I went to Buzz BBQ the other day for lunch.  It wasn't bad, mind you... but, for something that won \"Best in LV\" two years in a row, I expected a LOT better.  First off, just to start with something good, the place is HEAVY with the smell of smoked meats... always a good thing.  Also, they offer 2 decent BBQ sauces, a mild and a hot.  The hot really wasn't that spicy, but it had a decent enough flavor.  We started with the BBQ wings, which were average.  As I said, the sauce is pretty decent, so these were as good as expected.  For the entree, my date and myself had the \"2-meat\" meals.  I had the Andouille and Pulled Pork.  The Andouille... really wasn't.  It was more of a polish sausage.  Not that I'm complaining, it's just that it wasn't Andouille.  The pulled pork was kinda dry, and I needed to sauce the crap out of it.  With that, were the 2 sides of Mac and Cheese, and Fried Okra.  The Okra needed salt, and the mac and cheese... well...  OK, I originally come from the south, and I've had my share of Mac and Cheese.  Buzz BBQ puts (what I'm guessing is) oregano in their mac and cheese.  Something I have never had before, and although it wasn't terrible... it certainly didn't help the dish either.  My date had the chicken, and catfish.  She liked the oversized portion of catfish, and said the chicken was all smoke, and no other flavor.  She also had Okra, and the BBQ beans as her sides.  Aside from the lack of salt on the Okra, she said the BBQ beans were good.  She also had the Peach Cobbler, in which she said \"I've had better.\"  Overall, the price wasn't terrible, for some reason BBQ places seem to charge more than you are expecting anyway.  As far as \"Best in Las Vegas\" goes?  I'll say although I don't agree on their pricing (WAY too much IMO,) TC's Rib Crib (who won \"Best in Las Vegas\" in 2007) has better food.  Overall, I didn't hate the place... I just probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Hands-down, the best BBQ joint in Vegas. This is truly \"loved\" to perfection via the steel box smoker that adorns the patio in front of the restaurant.  Driving by and catching a whiff of the smoke is enough to make you salivate.  Not just the smoked meaty goodness makes the visit worthwhile, but the awesome sweet potato fries, fried okra, ice water coleslaw, and many other sides are equally delicious.  If you haven't yet...you must.  The Craig/95 location is just as good if you're on that side of town."}
{"text":"UPDATE: They closed!   Polite staff, clean tables. I enjoyed my catfish. A great place to go to just shut up and eat."}
{"text":"Lots of mixed reviews, decided to try it anyway...the service was great, the brisket was tender and the sauce was very decent-BUT the sides were awful!   *rolls were rock hard *potato salad was from a carton *cornbread was old and flavorless  *sweet tea bland! *corn was cooked within an inch of its life   First and last visit!"}
{"text":"Ate there on Saturday with a friend thats loves bbq.  Saw a sign in the lobby that said \" smoked turkey,limited time only\". Im not big on bbq so i tried to order the turkey. Waitress said it was for a limited time only and NOT today. My friend ordered the threemeat combo. The THREE ribs were good the catfish was ok and the pulled pork was dry. He had corn and cheese and macaroni for sides thecorn was ok but the mac n cheese was way too salty and not edible. I got chicken fingers that i could have ordered anywhere, and some tasteless fries that i didnt eat many of. Ketchup was clear and runny then a dark brown... Not a good experience all the way around especially for $40.00.....i went to wash my hands when i was done and was greeted by a DEAD COCKROACH in the mens room."}
{"text":"I was VERY dissapointed with this local BBQ place. I recently moved up to Las Vegas and was looking for a BBQ place on here. I only went because of the good reviews and I was shocked to see at how poor the quality of the food was. I asked how they prepared their mixed vegetables and they told me they were steamed with a little butter, because they were the frozen bag kind of veggies. The chicken had tons of fat! The ribs were sooo dried out. The sauces were ridiculous. Mild was bland, Hot was barely mild, and \"HOT SAUCE\" was Tapatio sauce re-bottled in a plastic container.  Very pricy for food I could buy at Smart and Final and reheat at a restaurant to upsell. I can't believe I passed up Famous Daves for this place. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great surprise.  We stumbled across this place by complete accident, but the smell from the parking lot was great so we decided to give it a try.  I am very glad that we did.  The meats that we tried (brisket, sausage and chicken) were all tender and nicely smoked.  Their BBQ sauces had the right level of spice and good flavor - they complimented the meats without overwhelming or masking the flavor of the meat itself.  Sides are only ok.  Fries were good, but mac and cheese was decidedly \"meh\"."}
{"text":"I've been to Memphis, Famous Daves, Lucilles etc and this was by far the best bbq I have had in Las Vegas. I didn't realize they had a huge bar with flat screen tvs for watching sports with great beers on tap. I had the Whole Chicken which was tender and moist. It was cut into smaller pieces which made the meal manageable and made for left over chicken sandwiches the next day. Amazing meal for 12 bucks. I highly recommend the baked beans as a side. The owner talked me into them and I almost enjoyed them more than the chicken.   PROS: 1. Amazing bbq sauce with a hint of spiciness 2. Extremely clean -  I was pleasantly surprised 3. Cool staff that gave a personal feel to the place 4. No corny themes or chain restaurant feel - just a good local vibe that concentrates on the food itself. 5. Happy Hour 4-CLOSE! Not the usual 2.5 hour gimmick!  CONS: No fork or napkins with my to-go order but not a big enough deal to drop to 4 stars.  OVERALL:  I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place gets the thumbs up for their moist and savory pulled pork alone. The brisket is a runner up for me with the right balance of tender and fatty meat. The ribs were smoky but a tad dry and, honestly, a little too smoky. The cure was adding some sauce, but that's a band-aid on the problem.  They have homemade cobbler that is absolutely incredible--I go for the blackberry. Once you get to this dessert, you'll stop talking as you race to eat it all before the delicious vanilla ice cream amalgamates into your cobbler, creating an intoxicating pool of sweet love."}
{"text":"Even though it has a lame name, Buzz has some awesome BBQ!  I don't understand why people go to chain BBQ places (ahem, Famous Dave's & Sonny's) when there's awesome places like this around.  I can't compare Buzz to other places in Vegas because I haven't tried many here yet, but I grew up eating TN/AL/GA BBQ, so I know what GOOD pork tastes like!  I'm not a sauce person - for me, it's all about the meat:  the tenderness, moistness, trimming of excess fat and the REAL smoky flavor (not liquid smoke!).  I either use no sauce at all or use just a dab, to add a little extra flavor & moisture, so I can't say if their sauce is good or bad - I'm just glad that they don't DRENCH the meat in sauce for me!  We decided to get the 4 meat combo for $30 and man, was it a LOT OF FOOD.  Our meats were: pulled pork (my favorite), beef brisket (2nd favorite), catfish fillets (yummy as well) and ribs (very mediocre).    The pulled pork was perfect!  I'm a picky pulled pork person - usually, there's tons of fat, gristle and outside \"burned\" stuff mixed into the pork.  This pulled pork was soft throughout, pulled in fine shreds and was totally juicy.    The brisket was cooked perfectly and just fell apart (I liked the regular sauce on it).    I'm not usually a catfish fillet person (I like them with the bone), but the catfish was super tasty.  They didn't taste too fishy and the batter was nice and crispy and not super greasy.  The ribs were kind of bland.  They were cooked well and literally fell off the bone, but I felt they needed a good dry rub on them.  For sides, we got fried okra, baked beans and french fries.  The okra was probably frozen, but it was a really good frozen okra (I'm never satisfied with restaurant okra lol).  The baked beans had a tiny bit of spicy kick to them and were pretty decent.  The french fries were really good fries, even though they looked like run of the mill, frozen fries.  For dessert was peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  OMG.  So.  Good.  That stuff was a little bowl of gooey, crunchy, warm goodness.  Can I go back & get some more now??"}
{"text":"You have to eat here. The food is great. Don't let the negative Nelly's keep you away. This is real food made with a lot of care and attention. The staff however is not so good. Waited to long to be seated when there where plenty of open seats. There is a real difference between the front of the house and back. We order carryout and it works out great.  Unfortunately they closed down recently."}
{"text":"Really, really good. We stumbled in here without seeking any reviews, and it worked out great. The ribs are smokey and succulent, pulled pork nicely fatty, and the andouille sausage was first rate. Had a limited number of sides--potato salad quite tasty, mac and cheese was just meh.   For dessert, I'd avoid the peach cobbler--too sweet, too much cinnamon. But he raspberrty was really nice."}
{"text":"I already reviewed the other location, but I decided to come back because they offered me a $5 off coupon last time, and there were still items on the menu I wanted to try.  I got the two combo special, with pulled pork and chopped brisket...at least, that's what I asked for.  They brought me the sliced brisket, which is what I had last time.  Oh well.  The pulled pork was unusually wet...not wet in the sense that it was drowned in BBQ sauce (the sauce is provided on the side), but almost like it was saturated in water or something.  Very, very odd tasting.  The brisket, once again, was very fatty and dry.  I've never said this before, but it was actually TOO MUCH meat for me to handle.  Oh, and it came with a couple of rolls on the side.  For some reason, I thought the bread came free with the meal, so I asked for some more, and imagine my surprise when I was charged $1.00 on the bill for two rolls!  Not a big deal, but just a heads-up if you're craving extra bread.  I've got to say...I'm not much of a fan.  It's all right, and the servings are well-portioned, but I've had better..."}
{"text":"I'm kind of torn about this place...  I think it deserves a second trip to really be fair...  But I'll document my first impressions here.  First off, the staff was nice and friendly.  So it started off on a good note.  I went for the lunch 2-meat combo: ribs and brisket (since I read they were good in other reviews) for $12.99.  The ribs were the St. Louis style spareribs, not the baby back ribs I have grown to love.  They were fatty, but nice and tender.  The brisket was flavorful, but kind of dry, so I elected to use some of their BBQ sauce on the side.  Ultimately, I think the sauce went better with the ribs.  I probably won't order either again, but I'd like to go back and sample some more stuff on the menu.  (In particular, the pulled pork and pulled chicken.)  I'll give it three stars for now, but I'll update on my next visit."}
{"text":"Was brought here by my husband....I figured it wouldn't be any good.So i went with a safe choice and got the chicken fingers. I tried what my husband ordered,which was the brisket, ribs and sausage...Just as i thought Yuck! Brisket was dry and the sausage tasted like it came from the grocery store."}
{"text":"I had the Texas Tornado sandwich and was very disappointed. The portion size was huge, but when I bit into it, it all became a big pile of mush. The brisket was chopped up making it stringy and paste-like, instead of being cut into thick strips, and was undistinguishable among the pork, which was also chopped up finely and mushy. The bun wasn't even toasted and held the same texture as the meat when bitten into. The only highlight was the andouille sausage but it was cut too thinly to accentuate it's full potential - as thick as pepperoni on a pizza.  I also had the Coleslaw which was disappointing as well. It didn't taste fresh and it's texture was soggy like it had been made a day or two prior. On a positive note, one thing Buzz did well was 'consistency', but unfortunately for them, it's was all consistently awful. I wonder how this place got so many favorable reviews because you've really got to TRY to make food as bad as the kind I had.  Barbecue Cuisine is made up of many different cuts of meat, each having their own distinct characteristics that make them special. Thus, barbecue cuisine should be presented to accentuate these characteristics not to blend them and/or make alike. I guess buzz didn't get the memo."}
{"text":"If taste were everything, this place would win hands down! I love this place and have been coming to Buzz since they were a little check wagon stand in a small shopping center on Ann Rd. near Centennial.  The only complaint that I could make is that it is just a little pricey, but I do understand what goes into smoking meat. The price of slow smoking can be costly. Buzz is definitively worth trying!"}
{"text":"alright im a fan of some good bbq and i must say i am a fan of this place. Ive tried 2 different sandwiches, some beef tips, pulled pork and a few others and let me say ive enjoyed them all. Im also a fan of there sweet potato fries i just wish they would give more that's the only down side, they need to put more sweet potato fries in the to go plates! But other than that this place is awesome and the prices a more than fair. I would highly suggest if your looking for some darn good BBQ you make a stop here at buzz's! There is alot of free parking and this place is totally easy to find. We usually order take out and there take out is very fast as well and the workers there are always so helpful to get us in and out."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I am by no means a BBQ snob...Texas, KC, etc...if it's good food, I'm all for it  That said, Buzz is a pretty darn good place to go for some BBQ.  The individual meal prices can seem a little steep, but the portions are large and you can get a 3 meat combo that will feed 2 people no problem  The quality was very good as well, we had the brisket, pulled pork, and rib tips with sides and we stuffed down as much as we could before throwing in the towel and getting a to-go box.  The meat is very tender and the sauce they have on the table is a great compliment.  The service is good, although it got busy after we arrived and they may have been a little short handed, but all in all we did not have to wait too long for drinks or the check.  Overall, I would recommend this to the casual BBQ fan any day of the week.  Much better than some of the larger chain restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My poor husband loves some good BBQ pork.  I, on the other hand, HATE BBQ AND PORK!  So when he said that he had a craving, I said that I would give it a whirl.   With that being said, we ordered the following:  *Sweet Tea: Personally, I like Raising Cane's the best.  The worst?  McDonald's.  So this was in the middle.  I would not order it again.  *3 Meat Combo: 1. Sausage- I don't like this kind of sausage, but my husband liked it. 2. Pork- surprise, surprise!  I really liked it!  Moist and full of flavor. 3. Beef Brisket- really good!  Fell off the bone and into my mouth. :)  *2 Sides: 1. Mac & Cheese- DISGUSTING!  I don't understand, but it was gross.  I would have rather had the blue box Kraft Mac & Cheese. 2. Sweet Potato Fries- very good!  The sugar on it puts it over the top.  *Peach Cobbler- eh.  I took 2 bites and that was it.  Not sure if it was the cheap vanilla ice cream that ruined it for me or what.  But definitely not a fan.   The restaurant has a \"mess hall\" feel to it, which was not something I enjoyed.  The food took a while, but the waitress was really nice.  Not sure if I would go back but I think my husband would go back for a pulled pork sandwich!"}
{"text":"Ok, so first off, I guess I should just come out and admit that I'm more of a Carolina-style BBQ girl, not a Texas-style BBQ girl. Even without the vinegar and mustard, though, I do always enjoy some good BBQ. Unfortunately, this place fell short - and not just on the food.  We found ourselves here because of the comedy show thingy that happens here regularly. $5 cover and some pretty bad / unfunny comedy. 1 star.  We had a Restaurant.com gift certificate, though, so I was excited to eat. We ordered the hot wings (of course) and the 2 meat combo (choosing beef brisket and pulled pork for the meats, and mac 'n' cheese and potato salad for the sides).  The wings were alright. No options as to mild, hot, etc. The sauce was decent and they were the right amount of crispy. But they were almost underdone and the ranch it came with (no choice of ranch or blue cheese) was rather bad. 2.5 stars.  Our meal didn't get any better with the 2 meat combo. I didn't find either the pulled pork or beef brisket to be very good - no smoke, no flavor, not that tender, etc. 2 stars. And the hot and mild BBQ sauce options didn't really do anything to help and weren't all that tasty. 2.3 stars. Good thing I hadn't eaten all day and was starving or I wouldn't have been able to stomach any of it.  The sides were a slight step up. The mac 'n cheese had little flavor, though, and definitely did not taste homemade by any stretch of the imagination. 2.2 stars. The potato salad, which also was definitely not homemade, was frankly the best part of the entire meal. 2.6 stars  The service was the worst part of the meal. Yep, even worse than the comedy. Now, I do give some forgiveness as it was an \"event\" and not a typical dining experience. Even with that, though, we had to go to the bar and ask for menus, it took quite awhile for a server to appear (and he rarely ever appeared again), etc. Even though we knew what we wanted to order for everything, the server wouldn't take our entree order before going away and putting in our drink and appetizer order. And when it came time to get the check... Well, let's just say that we were about to throw money on the table and leave it took so long. 0.5 stars.  The ambiance here is pretty much nil. There's nothing interesting or even slightly theme about it. It's definitely bare bones. And our table was wobbly and the chairs were uncomfortable. 0.5 stars.  So yeah, perhaps I sound like a grumbly curmudgeon, but I am not a fan of my experience here and I didn't care for their BBQ."}
{"text":"Bait and switch on their buy one get one free entree promo. Nowhere on the signage does it say that you have to buy two drinks to get the free entree. When I complained, I was told that they were losing too much money on the promo so they are having people buy the two drinks to make up for it. Total BS. Food was okay, not the best BBQ."}
{"text":"We ate there in January, and it was FREEZING inside the restaurant! I got catfish that was greasy and tasteless. (Which is the only reason that I'm glad that the portions are TINY!) My husband got the pulled pork that was served fairly cold. French fries were cold, too."}
{"text":"Buzz's ribs are only pretty good but the brisket is out of this world.  They have a great 'two person' special that will leave many couples (not us) with left overs."}
{"text":"We just moved to Las Vegas, and one of the things I try to find early when I move is a good BBQ place. Gotta say, Buzz BBQ was a good find. The service was great (ordered take out - server took ample time to help me with the menu), the food even better. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love Buzz BBQ, I've seen it for awhile grabbing In & Out. This takes the cake for bbq in Las Vegas for me. I've tried Famous Dave's, Memphis BBQ, and even Tc's ( which I'm not that happy with).   The service is great, walking in, the host is hilarious. The owner makes you feel at home, and wanting to come back. It wasn't that busy when I came in on a Thursday afternoon. They have a lunch special right now, if you buy a lunch meal, you get another free.  Let's get to the food part. The beef brisket was moist, and pulled pork melted in my mouth. Everything had that smokey bbq appeal, not greasy like certain places. The mac and cheese was on point, no so cheesey but creamy. I will definitely go back to this place :)"}
{"text":"I reeally need to remember to review a place right after trying it out... Here's what I remember:  Me and my friends are trying to hit up every BBQ place in town, and heard good things about Buzz. We were supposed to meet around 5:30 for dinner and that was when me and my BF arrived, but my friend didn't show up til about 6:30 due to rain and traffic. But the server guy seemed very anxious and kept trying to have us order and seem to be trying to rush us. I felt kind of uncomfortable with his approach.  When we finally ordered, which we got pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and brisket (combo) . And for dessert.. Blackberry Cobbler with freshly churned ice cream. Yum. And the guy that made the dessert actually came out to make sure we liked it.   Oh yeah, I remembered that we actually really wanted a pulled pork sandwich, but since we got the meat combo instead, we stuffed the dinner rolls with butter and the pulled pork and that was pretty good!  Overall, the service was 'okay' and the food was good, but not great. Nothing special about the ribs or pulled pork or the sides. The sauce wasn't great and the meat comes out pretty dry. There was a large party of 30 but our food still came out pretty quickly.  We did get a stamp card so there is a reason to go back. The food definitely wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. And for the same price, I have had better.  This review isn't that helpful is it?"}
{"text":"We tried the pork and the chicken sandwich for lunch, and it was very satisfying.  The meat was tender and sauce had good flavor. It was recommended to us by our neighbor.  I would eat there again.  Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food has always been excellent. So far its been the best BBQ on this side of town by far! The bbq sauce is amazing. Full of flavor with a hint of spiciness. The bbq sauce is served on the side so you can never have too much or too little. The best thing about this place is the lunch specials. We always get the pulled pork sandwich for 5.99, never disappoints. Their lunch specials also come with a huge choice of sides, which is great. Also, if you are up to dessert, definitely get the Blackberry Cobbler. It is HEAVEN!"}
{"text":"So since my first review Ive come back twice and EVERY time i get sick. Wed night I was throwing up again an hour or so after eating. i swear, im never coming back here again.   Not only that but this place is a rip now. Everything has gone way up. It was over 100 bucks for 6 people. Thats with us getting their \"deal\" combo 2 for 20. I noticed the combo didnt come with dessert anymore or include their drink. So not such a great deal.  Seriously, it took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. i dont know about you but that too long. Im hungry i expect food to come and be warm atleast. it was luke warm. Also, everyone moves soooo slow. I expect you to hurry to bring ym food in. Hustle woman. especially with the place being empty.  The food is nasty now. The cole slaw is flavorless and over powered by mayo. the mac n cheese should be called pepper and cheese. very watery. my two year old is a mac n chees addict and wouldnt even touch it. The ribs were full of fat. only two bites of meat. Corn bread was cold, so we asked for more and THEN it was brought out warm. not cool. Only thing good was the pulled pork.  Our waitress broke a dish at our table, next to my dughters high chair and just picke up the pieces. i would have liked her to sweep since it was right under my daughter. I dont want her to get glass in her shoe or whatever.  At first i thought i was being picky but everyone agreed and no one will be back"}
{"text":"Decided to grab dinner yesterday while waiting to pick up my computer from shop down the street. Tried the dinner for 2. Got ribs, brisket  and although I'm not a big fish eater I decided on the fish. Sides were  beans & Mac & cheese. When I arrived home decided to taste the fish first. That was all she wrote. Didn't eat anything else. The fish was Delish. Ate all of the pieces ( sorry Hun). Liked the ribs and brisket too. Good job !!!"}
{"text":"This place just is not that good.  We have eaten there a couple of times and the food is always mediocre at best.  Recently we used a $50 off from restaurant.com and ordered a ton of food.   We got: - bbq chicken which was not very good at all.  - some beef brisket which was pretty decent. - ribs which were terrible.  The ribs were fatty even for ribs and bland. - fried okra which was kind of insipid.   - beans and rice which was adequate. - greens which were pretty good. - buns which were dry and tasted like cheap store bought buns - sweet potato fries which were fine.  Just regular old fried sweet potatoes.  This is pretty much how every order we have placed there has been.  The food is middling to poor.  There is really no reason to go back for us, as it just is not worth it, even with a coupon.  Hard to find good BBQ in vegas."}
{"text":"OK, so it's not the *best* BBQ I have ever had, but when you live in San Francisco (where there's a huge gaping lack of good BBQ), then this will seriously work. The portions are huge, the food is tasty, service is friendly, and the prices are reasonable. If you want a no frills, down home BBQ in Las Vegas - go have you some Buzz!"}
{"text":"Poor quality bbq & misleading ad re 2 for $20 & kids eat free -- not so. Sauces were standard sweet tomato, nothing worth the effort."}
{"text":"I have been here before and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I brought my wife here as it was her request for some good BBQ. We were seated really quick and drink orders placed. After a bit we decided what we wanted. I ordered the pulled pork and ribs and my wife ordered the pulled chicken. We had sides of mac and cheese and beans. Now this is no joke, within 3 minutes our food was brought to the table! I was blown away as how in the heck could this be fresh? One taste of the mac and cheese (ICE COLD!!) told me I was in trouble. I asked the waiter for HOT AND FRESH, and about 1 1/2 minutes later I got piping hot (microwaved) mac and cheese. Ok, If it ended there I would just say it was a small bump in the road. I tasted my pulled pork and it was barley piss warm with no smoke flavor and extremely bland. Now I'm pissed and DONE eating. The waiter sees that I'm not eating anything and comes over to see what's up and I tell him I'm not happy. I explain that the food isn't even close to what I've had from this place before. Long story short he brings the owner over. I explain to him I've been in the place 2 other times and the food brought me back this time. I also tell him that the fact that it came out so quick meant to me that it wasn't fresh and it was just sitting in holders. How the heck couldn't it be when I got cold mac and cheese and pulled pork out in less than 3 minutes from ordering? His explanation was the he smokes his meat all day and to come back and see for myself( into the kitchen). I politely refuse, and told him I wasn't satisfied and couldn't eat my meal. I did pay for my ticket before he came over and he stated that he would refund my money. The owner indeed did refund my credit card and did ask that we come back and try them again. What more could I ask for? Like I said, I have had good BBQ here before,but it really only takes that one time. There are so many amazing places to try, I probably wont be back. Check them out for yourselves if you want."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years and have never been disappointed.  The staff is friendly and the food is great.  I prefer the pulled pork but have never had anything there I don't like."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place! Who doesnt love good BBQ? I mean really who doesnt?! Well we found this place the other day while driving around trying to find something for an early dinner. Inside is clean and open they even have a small dance floor and live music (not sure what days). We orderd the $20 deal with pulled pork,brisket,ribs, mac&cheese and greens with a side of sweet potatoe fries. Well they give you plenty of meat for sure but the sides are pretty small(-1 star) All the food was good creamy mac yummy greens and yummy smokey meats. Oh and the fries delish!! Customer service was great! Oh and I almost forgot the deal comes with dessert. The cobbler was soo good. A must try to cure that BBQ craving!"}
{"text":"I love the guys and wish them the best.  Unfortunately, it's been hit or miss.  My wife thinks it's too smokey, so if you don't like a cold smoke bbq it isn't for you.  I love a cold smoke.  I like the smokey flavor.  However, one day I go and it is the best i've had, and a week later it's off.  On the days it is good, it is some of the best bbq i've had in town."}
{"text":"While the meats were tender and good, our food was not hot. It was room temperature. Service was slow and very unenthusiastic. Our overall experience was just ok."}
{"text":"I live about 2 miles from this restaurant and had been meaning to try it for some time. Finally gave it ago with my 12 yr old daughter for some lunch yesterday afternoon. I had really high expectations after i saw the \"best of RJ\" award  stickers plastered all over the door.  I ordered a shredded brisket sandwich with Sweet potato fries, which was absolutely amazing,all the meat was super tender and moist and I could have eaten a pound of the sweet potato fries that were sprinkled with sugar, YUM!  My daughter had the ribs which she went to town on..they also were fall off the bone tender and she them ALL which is abnormal for her...so they must have been good!  The only thing I would change is the bbq sauce  they serve on the side. One bottle was marked \"mild\", the other was marked \"hot\" and I couldnt tell the difference between the two as they both tasted like regular bbq sauce. It would have been a homerun if the \"hot\" bbq sauce was actually hot.  Really great food, this will definitely be our new go-to bbq joint!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  Ordered the rib tip lunch.  Comes with a side, a roll and a drink.  I had ordered the mac and cheese as ther side but that might have been a mistake.  It was quite similar to a boxed mac and cheese.  Not the southern mac and cheese i was expecting.  The roll was typical supersoft plain roll.  Now for the important part, the meat.  Nice amount of smoke and  the meat was tender but still had a little meaty chew.  I hate bbq that disintegrates when you eat it.  They have two sauces on the table.  Both tomato(probably ketchup) based.  The hot could have used a little more bite but had a good flavor.  The prices were also reasonable.  $8.90 for the meal."}
{"text":"Server was very friendly, cook even stepped out of the kitchen to ask how our meal was. I had the brisket sandwich which was good but the bun fell apart because of all the meat. My husband had the sausage dinner which he ate for lunch and had enough leftover for a whole meal. I chose collard greens as a side which were a bit salty. My husband had Mac n cheese and ice water Cole slaw. His Mac n cheese was a bit bland but he said he'll never eat Cole slaw anywhere else. We shared a peach cobbler for dessert and it was out of this world. Next time I'd get the $20 meal for two because out two meals was a lot of food. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Only one word comes to mind to sum up my Buzz BBQ experience....DISAPPOINTING.  The brisket was flavorless and dry, the sausage was OK with the casing providing a good snap but as far as the flavor was considered it was mediocre.  Ribs were tender and moist yet flavorless.    Hey Buzz!... listen up you shouldn't have to rely on sauce to provide both flavor and moistness to the meat.  The meat should be the star with the sauce simply providing a new dimension and flavor to an all ready existing exceptional cut of meat, however with your BBQ this is simply not the case.  Lastly the sauce wasn't even that good, the \"Hot\" sauce was simply not so.  So with that being said, onward in my search to find exceptional BBQ in the Las Vegas valley."}
{"text":"I've been here 3+ times in the last few weeks and I'm already planning my upcoming visits. I've had great service and really great food.  I always get the meat combo w/ sides. My two fave meats are brisket and pulled pork. My two favorite sides are collard greens and collard greens. :) Try the ribs too... Wow!  As a pie hater, I didn't think to order the cobbler a la mode, but due to the waiter's convincing promise of its goodness, we gave it try. Wow! It's one of the best restaurant desserts ever. I've only had blackberry. Try it, seriously.  There are coupons on the company's website that don't have an expiration, so just double check with your waiter if you can use 'em before ordering. I'm mos def a regular --- See you there!"}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Las Vegas. Every time I visit Buzz is the munchies! Their BBQ sauce is to die for. You will not regret eating here."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite BBQ joint in las Vegas. They have great sandwiches, sides, plates, and appetizers. Their cobbler is very good too."}
{"text":"Sept. 14th, 2011    After reading mixed reviews on Yelp, my girlfriend and I decided to check it out for ourselves.  We drove by and saw that they had a $19.99 deal that fed two and we were in the mood for some good BBQ so we figured why not.  Unfortunately, we were both disappointed.  Ordered:  The $19.99 feeds 2 special, which includes 3 meats of choice, 2 sides, and 2 desserts.  We chose Chicken, Beef Brisket, and Rib Tips for our meats and Corn on the Cob and Mac and Cheese for our side dishes.  To drink I had a sweet tea and my girlfriend ordered ice water.  Pros:  * Friendly waitress that allowed us to sample their coleslaw prior to ordering it as our side item. * The feeds 2 deal is a pretty good (price wise)   Cons:   * Sweet Tea:  There was some sweetness present, but it had a watered-down taste. Not a fan. On top of that, she messed up my order and gave me a soda at first. * Mac & Cheese:  Nothing fancy about the Mac/Cheese.  I've found better in the frozen aisle * Corn on the cob:  How do you mess this up?  Seriously that's bad!  Tasteless.  I might as well have ordered a side of butter because that's all I was tasting. * Ice Water Coleslaw:  Thank god the waitress was kind enough to let us try this...  This was a vinegar-based coleslaw (not the typical mayo-based).  I could see how some people would like this, but I didn't really care for it at all. * Chicken:  One word- DRY!   * Rib-Tips: DRY!  (It was the best of the 3 meats we ordered, but only after drowning it in sauce.  Speaking of sauces... Even their sauce was not too tasty.  The hot sauce wasn't hot at all and the BBQ sauce didn't kick my taste buds. * Beef Brisket: The Driest of the Dry! I was speechless... What a disappointment.  I love Beef Brisket, but not from Buzz BBQ !  Tips:  * Go to Lucille's BBQ at the District * If you go to Buzz BBQ, don't order anything we ordered! * There's an In-N-Out in the same plaza (hint-hint)!  Overall:    I honestly hate giving bad reviews and try hard to find the positives in the places I go and I always go with an open-mind, but seriously this was an extreme disappointment.  I was excited to try the cobbler because I did read some good reviews, but I was so irritated that we just skipped the dessert all together.  I literally left that place with less money, unwanted leftovers, and an unsatisfied appetite.  Everything had the same Dry and Smokey taste.  I could make excuses for them and say they were having a bad day, but seriously this place was horrible.  We even overheard the couple complaining to the waitress about their food.  Everything I tried was subpar.  Sorry for the bashing Buzz, I just feel as if you owe me some money.  What's the \"Buzz\" amount?  Definitely not Buzz BBQ.  I should have went to In-N-Out.  I would have had a satisfying meal and extra money to Red Box it!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has four stars. Maybe it's because 6 of the five star reviews are from people with only one review (Buzz BBQ) and zero friends.   I've had a Restaurant.com coupon for Buzz BBQ for quite a while, so my boyfriend and I finally decided to try it out. We had pretty high expectations since the place has a solid 4 stars. The last time we went out for BBQ, we went to Lucille's and I guess I was expecting it to be comparable to that, but I was very wrong.  Upon entering, we noticed that had a 2 for $20 deal, which was a better deal than what we would get with our Restaurant.com coupon, so we went with that instead. You get to choose 3 meats, 2 sides, and 2 desserts. We got the rib tips, beef brisket, chicken, mac n cheese, and corn on the cob. There wasn't an actual menu for the 2 for $20 deal, so the lady just told us what we could pick and she failed to mention that the dessert was included. We were under the assumption that the dessert was an extra cost because she asked us, \"Did you guys want any dessert or anything?\" Why would she ask us that rather than tell us to pick which dessert we wanted? I later found out that the dessert comes with the meal, which was pretty annoying because I would've wanted dessert to rid my taste buds of all the horrible flavors.   Every meat we ordered was extremely dry and extremely smoked. If it wasn't for the different textures, I wouldn't be able to tell which meat was which because it all just tasted the same (very smoked). I pretty much had to drown everything in the sauces which tasted like gourmet ketchup.The sides were both bland, so those didn't even help. I don't even understand how they made the mac n cheese flavorless, but they pulled it off. This was the first time we didn't finish a 2 for $20 meal together and it wasn't because of the portion size. We only ate half of everything and we didn't even want the leftovers.    I can honestly say that I will not be coming back here again. I left this place feeling like my mouth was used as an ashtray. You know how smokey and gross your hair gets when you walk through the casinos? Well that's how my mouth felt after eating here. The only good thing about my experience is that I was able to get a refund from Restaurant.com after telling them about my experience."}
{"text":"We had the Pulled Pork, Sweet Potato Fries, and Apple Cobbler Ala Mode. BBQ sauce was good. Service was great   This place is closed now:( I think the owner moved out of state"}
{"text":"Good BBQ and a great special.  The ambiance is just ok, the food pretty good, what gave this 4 stars was that we got a $25 gift certificate for $15 - and it even covered tax!  Our meal was about $24+ and we left a $5 tip so we got about a $30 meal for $20 bucks."}
{"text":"I love brisket.  I spent a few years in Lawton, Oklahoma, and every winter we would stop by one of the store where a brisket vendor would be, grab a few pounds with their homemade bbq sauce and eat that for dinner almost every night.  I never get sick of it.  Since moving back home and then here to Vegas 2 years ago, I never thought that I'd find that bbq brisket with homemade bbq sauce again.  This place has great brisket and sauce.  Their rolls are great, too!  If you want a nice, quick bbq meal any time of the year, they can do that for you.  It is voted one of the best in Vegas for 2009 and I can see why.  Although southerners may not feel as positively about this place as some of us do, it's good for the money you pay and in taste.    Their sauce is nice and has that subtle heat you want in a bbq sauce, with a sweet finish.  I am glad that they put it to the side when you order eating in or taking out.  I love ordering to take out for dinner because it's only a 10 minute wait. Their rolls come out hot, too.  I eat those with honey butter!    The ribs are good, too, but I've honestly had better.  I say that out of their entire menu, their brisket seems to be the best thing on it.  Give it a try.  I thought it was worth the money, and we do eat here quite a bit now."}
{"text":"Four stars solidly. Too much food! Kinda wasteful. Great experiece overall. Recommend the brisket and the ribs."}
{"text":"Decided to get my BBQ Monster fed again...and what a shock I got.  The sauce that I was previously a little concerned  with is (as revealed by my server) KC Masterpiece with some of Buzz's rub added  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!  This led me to ask some questions about the sides, which I was also a bit sketchy on.  Mac n Cheese...out of a tub.  Frozen okra...fried to order.  The BBQ is excellent,  but the sides (with my exception of the collard greens) were totally sub par.  Here is to hoping they get some real sauce and fresh sides."}
{"text":"C'mon Vegas.....Seriously....15 reviews and all 4 and 5 stars... Clearly, Vegas is severely deprived of good BBQ.  I was so hopeful and excited to read the reviews and after the first bite I knew I was crushed.  We got the AYCE for 14.99, extremely reasonable, but the ribs really dissapointed.  They were dry, lacked smokiness and flavor.  Good BBQ is moist and the flavor should be able to stand on its own.  If you want to drench sauce on it, then it should be good with it too.  Both the sauces were really sweet.  I tasted the Hot sauce and thought the bottles were switched.  I wanna give this place 1 star but our server was really nice.  That and I'd probably get flagged since 15 of you people somehow gave this place 4-5 stars.  I couldn't even eat a second plate and all I wanted to eat were the sides which were sub-par.    After finishing the meal, we trekked down Tropicanan all the way to Maryland till we found an eager homeless person to give our left overs to.  Hopefully he enjoyed it :0"}
{"text":"First off before I bash the place let me say it if I wanted a BBQ sandwich for lunch at 8 bucks with a soda and a side I would eat here every time, just it's not a take the family or friends out to a BBQ feast place for me.      The meat was the most tender BBQ I have ever had, suspiciously tender, too tender.  I mean ribs so tender you could barely pick them up without them falling apart, some might love that but at a point it's too much.  The pulled pork came off as just a little mushy but had no chunks of fat like you might see elsewhere.   I say suspiciously because meat smoked gets very tender but not fall apart tender like it's been braised or stewed and it also gets a crusty \"bark\" on the outside that rocks, it contrasts with the tender meat inside. Here the BBQ has no bark.  The meat did have an authentic almost strong smokey flavor and a smoke ring and you can also smell the smoke outside so I am not sure whats up, perhaps they smoke it for a while and then steam it or something to get it extra tender.  I ate there at 2 so it's not like it could have been sitting in a steamer tray all day but thats what it reminded me of.    The flavor just wasn't there out side of the strong smoke.  It needed salt at a minimum, there was no rub taste I could distinguish at all.  The sauce is ok but thin and diluted and the sides were, well, sides.    The dessert cobbler with ice cream was very buttery and delicious but a little small to share and it was 6 bucks."}
{"text":"Lots of meat per serving. Flavor is amazing. Better than other BBQ places I've tried! Comparable to Lucille's and much closer to me. Get the 3 meat combo, comes with 2 sides and rolls, only $20! Fed my boyfriend and me, even brought home left over! Love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Its the best barbecue place in town. You MUST order the brisket and sweet potato fries. Also not too crowded usually easy to get in and out of. The okra, baked beans and rib tips are also good."}
{"text":"Waited for 10 mins in lobby with nobody to be seated and no body helped us as we walked out then they wanted to help us.  5:30 on a Saturday and you have zero customers your service is why."}
{"text":"3.75 stars  We are visiting from California and had a restaurant.com gift card. This was one of the places that took the gift cards.  We had the family meal with a chicken, ribs, brisket, sausage, three sides, and rolls. For sides, we had potato salad, baked beans, fries, Mac n cheese. None of the meat comes sauced  Chicken: ok. Very smoky but the skin was kinda weird 3 stars Ribs: tender, smoky, flavorful 4 stars Brisket: omg! So good. Tender, delicious, I couldn't stop nibbling on it. 5 stars Baked beans: good 3 stars Mac n cheese: gross, wow. Truly terrible 1 star Fries: crispy and delicious.   Service was attentive Sweet tea was pretty good, although I had it mixed with unsweetened.   Apple cobbler was good: 3.5 stars Patch cobbler was also good: 3 stars"}
{"text":"2 words... No Bueno!  I was so excited to return to Buzz's since I had eaten at another location last year while I was visiting Vegas. I had remembered that they had AMAZING blackberry cobbler. We first attempted to visit on Monday but the location was closed.  We returned today and had some serious built up anticipation. We sat down and ordered sweet tea, it was just the way I liked it, and the brought us super nummy cornbread! Both my friend and I ordered the 3 item combo as we like to have leftovers. I was thrilled that they had all the meats pulled, just the way I like em! I ordered pulled brisket, pulled chicken and pulled pork ALL of which were good! As my sides I ordered mac and cheese, collard greens and corn on the cob. The mac and cheese was shameful at best, the greens and corn were ok, but nothing special. For dessert I ordered the blackberry cobbler which, as I remembered, was VERY good!   Overall the meal was good but nowhere worth the $30+ per meal we paid. I was shocked to see the bill after the $25 gift certificate I had, had been applied was still over $50. I had noticed that the server had taken it upon herself to add in 20% gratuity, which I thought was a bit generous considering the service we had. The server was pleasant, but not very attentive.  Overall, I was not impressed enough with the food to make a return trip. I think for the money I spent here, I could've had a much better meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"Buzz BBQ  had some pretty solid BBQ.  We got the sampler platter and we got a ton of great food for pretty cheap.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a big, huge juicy steak.  We were on our way to another restaurant when I missed my turn off on Sahara (Ooops) and I wound up on Tropicana and 215.  Maybe it was a little planned, but we made our way in on a Monday night.  The place was empty except for us at 9pm at night.  We were quickly seated and drink orders were taken right away.  My family and I sat in a booth and marveled at the smells coming from the kitchen.  In fact, this place is next to an In N Out and the BBQ smell probably over powers and redirects many of their patrons as well!  I had the 2 meat combo with Ribs and Shredded Pork.   For sides I had baked beans and sweat potato fries.  The sweat potato fries were AWESOME!  The ribs were awesome too.  I loved how it just fell off the bone and into my mouth!  My wife had the beef brisket with macaroni and cheese and fried okra.  My son had the fried catfish sandwich and my other two boys had the shredded pork sandwich with shredded pork.  The rolls came out after our order and it was quickly devoured.  The bread was fresh and soft and almost reminded me of Hawaiian Sweet Bread.  Our food came out in less than 10 minutes and we were more than happy!  The fried catfish is absolutely delicious and my wife will be ordering that next time we come. My shredded pork and ribs were awesome.  I will next time just get a plate of ribs instead.  Shredded pork was very flavorful.   For desert we had apple cobbler a la mode.  A great cap to the end of dinner.  Yelp Check in gave us 15% off our check!  Our waiter was awesome and very friendly.  His accent made us feel like we were the southeast part of the United States.  Great place, nice and clean and very delicious food!  We're definitely coming back here sometime soon!"}
{"text":"We had a craving for bbq and decided to use our restaurant.com coupon to try this place out. We ordered the catfish dinner (from recommendations from a friend) and the 3 meat combo dinner (to sample the pulled pork, ribs and brisket). We also tried collard greens, sweet potato fries and mixed greens for our sides.   The catfish was ok, has a nice crispy outside but wish they have a good dipping sauce for it. Now onto the meats. No big surprise. None of the \"Oh-my-goodness-this-is-so-good-I-can't-stop-until-I've-licked-my-plate-clean\" euphoria that I was expecting. The pulled pork is probably the best out of the three. It's tender but it dried out during the dinner. The brisket is done well, but it's nothing spectacular. The ribs are the worst, so don't even bother ordering it. By the way, I had to add a couple squirts of hot sauce onto the hot bbq sauce and frankly, I'm disappointed by their sauce.  For the sides, the collard greens are ok; I've actually had better at a friend's thanksgiving bash. Sweet potato fries are good, so do order this if you have to choose a side. Mixed greens are from the frozen bag.  Also, the service is mediocre at best. We had to wait an exorbitant about of time to be seated when there are only two other tables of guests. The waitress forgot our rolls and then another one forgot to bring back a drink refill."}
{"text":"I have been to Buzz BBQ one time. They were part of a church fundraiser for the college group. I brought some of my visiting family members. We were hungry! So, we ordered a family combo meal. There was enough food for the five of us to eat twice! The meat was delicious. This was maybe six months ago. I still remember the sausage and brisket. We would definitely bring a group to Buzz BBQ again for that family special.   In fact, my fiance and I thought about this place a few days after eating at a different BBQ restaurant."}
{"text":"Very odd setup to the restaurant itself.  The floor is very open, and all of the booths are oversized and face the middle, making it seem like more of a dance or bingo hall rather than a restaurant.  The actual food was just average.  The meat was well cooked, but the sides were very bland, and all the food was served luke warm.  the BBQ sauce was very good however, so it could be used to cover the taste of anything you didn't like.  The service was awful.  With only 13 people in the whole restaurant (with the open seating floor plan we were able to count) we waited a very long time for drinks, had to get our own silverware from an adjacent table and the orders were not correct.  Unfortunately, the poor service eliminated any thoughts of us giving the food a second chance."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed at the place.  It had high reviews, but this was below my expectations.  The meat was dry.  Service was super nice though."}
{"text":"After enjoying my first take-out experience with Buzz BBQ back when it was on Ann Road, I decided to dine-in at this location on W Craig Rd. Everything from the restaurant's decor to the food and prices was nothing short of disappointing.  To start my review, the service was \"a matter of opinion\". If you like your servers aggressive, in-your-face, and meat-headed, Buzz BBQ will suit your fancy. If you DON'T like servers that are doing everything they can to suck the extra dollar out of your pocket (including conveniently not charging you for a beer then saying \"you can put it on the tip if you like\"), you might want to avoid Buzz BBQ.   But it all comes down to the food, right? Not a good thing for Buzz. The cold-water coleslaw was inedible. The macaroni and cheese was tasteless. The rib tips were WAY too smokey. Did I mention the rib tips were WAY too smokey? Yes, I did; but I can't emphasize that enough. Some people like the smoke flavor, and I don't usually mind it, but Buzz BBQ takes it to the next level. My breath smelled like wood when I was finally done chomping through the dry rib tips. Not good.  I don't know why so many people I know rave about Buzz BBQ. With a Famous Dave's just a few miles away, my advice would be to visit Dave for all your barbeque needs."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for lunch-- brisket sandwich was just \"ok\". Decent sweet tea and service.  What is GREAT is the peach cobbler ala mode!!"}
{"text":"I got the BBQ for two with rib tips, pulled pork, beef brisket, together with slaw and sweet potato fries.  The slaw was a bit different shredded cabbage with vinegar in lieu of mayo, but was pleasantly tart and tasty.  The sweet potato fries were perfectly fried and arrived nice and hot.  The meat was the star of the meal, rib tips with just the right amount of crisp burn, the pulled pork was nicely smoked and tender, and the brisket slices were beefy/fatty in the right proportion.  I had peach cobbler and my friend had blackberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  Both were good.  The only fault was that my ice tea (non sweet) was a bit off.  I find this is a common fault in locations/stores that are fairly new until they get the hang of making it and also washing the containers properly.  All in all a tasty meal and I will be back."}
{"text":"People are super friendly and the aroma of smoked meat makes your mouth water. They have a stage for live bands that play blues, jazz, and oldest.  We first order southern sweet tea and its made perfect! Not too sweet and not over brewed."}
{"text":"Buzz BBQ is decent 'Que but unfortunately based on my loving relationship with Dinosaur BBQ(probably the best BBQ ever) I simply can't rate it higher than 3 stars.  The $20 special including 3 meats, 2 sides, and rolls is a great meal to split with a date or just a good friend who wants to pig out. A great array of meats and sides allows you to truly sample the menu. Unfortunately the meat was a bit cold when it came to the table but the hot BBQ sauce was delicious!   I'll definitely be giving Buzz BBQ a second chance to impress simply because I have a soft spot in my heart for authentic BBQ. The owner seems like he truly had a passion for what he was doing and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Let's break this down to the basics.   3 of 5 stars for BBQ & Service only. It was alright but it wasn't the greatest and everything else was unimpressive as well.  BBQ was legit. Smoked. Tender. Lean cuts of Brisket with hardly any marbling  The sausage was not my favorite and a little fatty.   Service: Good! I felt very welcomed by the server and the head chef(cook)who came out of the kitchen to check on us.    2 of 5  Sides: Sweet Potato Fries were very good. Dusted lightly with sugar and salt. The baked beans were average. Rolls, average. To be honest everything but the fries tasted store bought.  Price & Quantity: We did the 2 meat combo that is also advertised to feed 2 people for $20! It was just barely enough food. In fact I felt that for the price it was NOT enough food. There really is nothing special to the combos. The only thing you are paying for is the timely process that it takes to make this traditional smoked bar-b-que.   Buzz Suggestions:  I would suggest that you beef up your portions, Buzz!  I do love me some brisket but I won't pay $16-20 a plate for it. Also the BBQ sauces tasted store bought.  You can't call yourself a real BBQ place unless you get better tasting sides with more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've past this place a few times and checked out the reviews on yelp. We ordered the 3 meat mix. We choose: catfish, ribs and brisket. My husband loved the brisket. He said it was delicious without the BBQ sauce. Of course, he did add some. He doesnt eat pork, but he loved the brisket so much, he decided to try it. He enjoyed that very much as well. I had some catfish, it was yummy! Nice and crispy, lots of flavor and not overdone with salt. The meal came with 2 buns, and 2 sides. All for $20. Definitely a great deal. We ordered dessert. Blueberry cobler with home-made ice cream. That was good too. The owner was our server and he was so nice."}
{"text":"Finally a good BBQ place in the southwest! Buzz just opened up about a week or two ago. It's owned by 3 guys and this is their second location (the original place is off of Craig Road). I stopped by and ordered a brisket sandwich ($8.00) to go. As I waited I chatted with the hostess and one of the owners. Both were incredibly nice and raved about some of their specialties. The brisket didn't disappoint. It was a huge mound of soft and tender beef brisket on a sesame seed bun. The BBQ sauce that accompanied it had a little kick to it but was also a little on the sweet side... maybe a little too sweet. But, it was still a delicious and filling sandwich. Their fries are also excellent.  I'll definitely be back to try some ribs and pulled pork. They had their smoker set up on the patio so the whole parking lot had that amazing BBQ smell."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what everyone's bunged up about?  In the BBQ world, Buzz rocks! This is our annual trip to Las Vegas and Buzz's is definitely part of the schedule! From the wonderful smell of smoke when you walk in the door, to the excellent ribs and brisket, this place oozes BBQ genius! I agree the sides and service are a bit lackluster, but the meat is to die for! Both the mild and spicy (hot) BBQ sauces are tasty. I like to mix them together in equal parts for the best of the best! True BBQ aficionados owe it to themselves to try this place!!"}
{"text":"I found my new authentic BBQ joint in Las Vegas! OK first to the good stuff... I ordered a 3 meat combination dinner w/ ribs, brisket and pulled pork. First, I love this place because there's no 'sauce' on the meat. The 'smokey flavor' and 'falling apart meat' stand on its own. The rib meat just falls off the bones and the fat has been rendered down to almost nothing. The brisket also falls apart on your fork or in your fingers! The smoke ring is very apparent on both of these meats! The pulled pork had zero fat and was completely lean. Here's where I tried the BBQ sauces. The mild is tasty but I preferred the hot! Both were good!  I ordered BBQ beans and cole slaw. The beans were OK (not much character) but the slaw was not. It reminded me of the slaw you would get with salsa at a mexican restaurant. (not a fan)  The server was OK as was the ambience. We could not figure out what was missing but if we do I'll post. (because we're definitely going back) The large room had big screen tvs, a band stand and a dance floor? Didn't really look like a restaurant but it definitely is! With this great meat, who cares!!!  This is my new 'go to place' for BBQ while in Las Vegas!! So I'm giving Buzz 4 stars. If the beans and cole slaw were more tradional and the service was better I would rate 5."}
{"text":"Just try the brisket.  You'll be talking to yourself its so dang good.   All themeats are fantastic even without sauce.  That's. good bbq."}
{"text":"Yummm.  I'm in the Northwest and this place is pretty close to me.  I had driven by it numerous times before I saw the reviews and decided to give it a try.  The reviews are spot on.    The first thing I noticed before I got to the door was the smell of the meats.  Wow!  I ordered the three item with ribs, links, and brisket.   The meat was perfectly seasoned and tender.  I agree with the prior posters about the sauce.  I'm not a fan of thin sauces but the meats didn't really need it.  It came with two side choices and a couple rolls.  It was enough for two people.    The owner is extremely friendly.  I have already recommended this place to others and am definitely going back."}
{"text":"True to my Texas upbringing, I have always been a big fan of barbeque. There's nothing more satisfying than a perfectly smoked rack of ribs or a tender and juicy beef brisket. ---  Neither of these will you find at Buzz BBQ.  Really lazy barbeque joints boil their meat before smoking it for a brief period to try and give it that smoky flavor.   They may serve it with barbeque sauce on the side, but it is by no means a dry rub or anywhere near slow-smoked. The meat is tender, to be sure, but that's what happens when you boil the meat to death. Despite my best efforts, I could not determine what method they used to get their nasty smoke flavor, but it tastes like it was finished over a bed of burning dead animal carcasses.  To me, great barbeque tastes incredible without any sauce (unless of course you are talking about Carolina style barbeque) and you add the sauce to add that little extra flavor. Buzz BBQ needs to be drowned in sauce to mask that nasty taste their meat gets from their smoking method.  Oh, and in case you're not disappointed enough with the food, they'll be sure to kick you in the head with the bill - because no disastrous dining experience is complete without a double-blow to the stomach and the wallet."}
{"text":"I went to Buzz BBQ for the first time tonight to attend a Social Marketing event. And I decided to try the food. Boy am I glad I did. It was melt in your mouth BBQ. Like the kind you wish you could get... oh, wait, you can.. It was extremely fair priced. I got the three meat combo and had a ton left to bring home to my husband and I had a little more as well. :) And my husband also commented that it was absolutely great BBQ. You have to try it!!"}
{"text":"Okay food, terrible service. Our server was friendly, but he disappeared once our food was served. We were never offered refills; my husband sat with an empty cup for the duration of our meal. I believe our server was also cooking, but the other server in the dining room was studiously playing the \"not my table\" game. We also sat with empty plates, waiting for the check for well over fifteen minutes. Finally a manager sent another server over to take payment from us. The neglectful service plus the fact that the food was nothing to write home about means we likely won't be back. Too bad, because our check in earned us a 20% off coupon that we didn't use, because we didn't want to wait any longer."}
{"text":"Just got the 2 meat combo with cole slaw and potatoe salad. I got it to go. First thing i notice when i left was how light my bag of food was. When i got home I found out why. First combo had pork and brisket With only 3 very small strips of meat. Pork was probley an ice cream scoop size.  kinda dissapointed.  But meat was very good just not worth the price."}
{"text":"Ok, ppl kinda tired of the low ratings this place is a great family restaurant. The staff are so kind and they work so hard on a skeleton crew. The food is amazing dry rub and sauce for everything and don't get me started on there peach cobbler it's just good. Great holesome place that is in need of support from the locals. If we won't support a business like this then we fall pray to more of the same chain restaurants plaguing this town. As a foodie I'm ashamed more people won't give this place a shot. The more ppl going the better the service will get."}
{"text":"I like bbq and this place had me all worked up for a slab of meat and good sauce. I had the brisket and chicken. Good smoke flavor no doubt. I asked the guy behind the counter what kind of wood they used and he gave me a look like how dare I ask and laughed as he said hickory. He said all good bbq uses hickory - that's debatable - but it was good.  To me the sauce has got to hold up and their sauce did not. To watery, reminds me of memphis bbq, can't stand it, and it lacks flavor.  The sides were subpar. The beans were straight out of a can, and the mixed veggies were the standard green beans, corn and carrots you get from the grocery store for 99 cents a bag.  To their credit, I didn't try any desert so I can't comment on those.  3 stars just for the meat and meat alone, bring it home, slather with your own sauce and you're good to go."}
{"text":"DEFINITELY THE BEST BBQ JOINT IN LAS VEGAS!!! A piece of Texas in Nevada!  Go for lunch if you want to avoid the Vegas strip prices!   - We found this place by luck in the middle of August at 107 degrees. - Ron S checked in using Yelp mobile and we got the 20% discount off our entire bill. - We were sold on the Lunch special sign: $5.99 for chopped brisket, pulled pork, one side, and drink. - Upon entering the AC was kicking.... Thank you God!  We're from San Jose, California... so this was not our home turf weather. - Big recommends:   Get the pulled pork and brisket two lunch combo for $12.99!    Oh so succulent and juicy... rightly smoked!   - And also get the FRIED OKRAS!!!   Super crunchy !!! - Yes, the smoker is in front of the restaurant.   Truly authentic Texas BBQ! - Wanna save more money?  Order food to go and have it for later.   In this case, we all ordered the Texas Tornado (Brisket, Pork, & Sausage) for $10.50. - Ask for extra BBQ sauce because its homemade tangy kick with bombdiggity spices!    My bad for not thinking about buying a take home bottle!    - Will You Redo:   F**K YEAH!   I'm coming back.... with or without the crew! - Parking:  Plentiful during our lunch visit. - Accepts Debit:  Yes. - Perfect Date Spot:  If she can throw down with BBQ sauce on her fingers....she's a keeper! - How Many Miles from the Strip:  The drive is about 13.1 miles.    But so worth it for lunch!   Special Thanks to Ron S for covering lunch!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very affordable and very good BBQ.  More St Louis style than Kansas City.  Meat has a great smoked flavor.  I find myself not using any BBQ sauce as it tastes so good already.  We go to Buzz about twice a month and it's always great.  Check out the dinner for two at 19.95. Great deal and you will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Was going to go to Cabo Cantina at Santa Fe Station for lunch today with the family, but it was closed and didn't open until 3 pm.  So what did I do?  I jumped on Yelp to find an alternative.  What I found was Buzz BBQ which was only 1.5 miles away.  Food - There is a ton of selections to choose from (see pics for menu).  I was going to order the Beef Brisket sandwich and the Pulled Pork sandwich, but the waitress convinced me to try the Tornado sandwich....which has Beef Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Sausage in it.  The sandwich is huge.  I ordered Fries on the side with Blue Cheese Dressing for dip.  There are 2 sauces on the table.....Hot & Mild.  The Hot is not really that hot at all.....kind of disappointing as I like spicy BBQ sauce.  They get a -1 for that.  They also get another -1 for charging us $.50 ea for the Ranch and Blue Cheese dressing for our Fries.....I think that kind of stuff is petty....especially since our sandwiches were $11 a pop.  The Tornado sandwich was very tasty.  I can taste the flavor of each meat.  The bun was just ok though....I think they could do better than that.  Even though they didn't have a spicy sauce, I liked how they allowed you to dress your sandwich with the sauce of your choice....I hate it when places drench their sandwiches in sauce.    Service - The service was fast and the server was friendly, +1.  Atmosphere - The restaurant is in an outdoor shopping mall....they have it decked out in Western decor, but it's not really convincing....kind of cheesy actually....but that doesn't matter to me with a restaurant of this caliber.  We had a clean table & booth and they gave us a roll of paper towels just in case....which is nice touch.  I would have given this place 4 Stars, but the lack of a true spicy sauce and the petty charge for the dressings made me drop them to 3 Stars.  I still prefer them to the Memphis chain that's in town.  Will I come back?  Sure, when I'm in the mood for BBQ.  Next time, I will bring my own sauce....lol."}
{"text":"Vegas locals have told me this is the best bbq in all of las Vegas. While this may be true, I believe this is simply due to lack of options. Bbq meats were decent but nowhere near anything one could find on any corner of Texas, Memphis, or even LA. The best part of my dinner was the cobbler for desert topped with home made ice cream."}
{"text":"I've eaten Buzz BBQ once to go for dinner  and we got all the various different meats. I couldn't stop eating it was so good. Today I just ate it dining in with a few co-workers and got the Texas Tornado which has the various meats of deliciousness on it. Once again super good. I got the sweet potato fries as well and they have a light sprinkle of sugar on them. Very good as well. Our server was good, fun and friendly and even joked with us. Overall it's a FIVE star rating from me!"}
{"text":"Spotted the smoke stack in back so I knew I was in for a treat.  Restaurant layout was nice, western theme with some large LCDs for catching a game.  Staff was very friendly.  Nice looking menu, everything from rib tips to chicken and brisket.  We were there on Sunday afternoon just after they opened (at Noon).  I got the 2 meat combo -Brisket and Ribs with Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens, Buddy got the Brisket and pulled pork.  Sides were ok, not the best; Mac and Cheese could use more cheese and the Collard green could use more flavor.  The Brisket was super tender and had a smoke ring but lacked any real smoke flavor.  The ribs were spare ribs, had a nice bark and were super tender but again no smoke flavor.  There were 2 sauces they provided along with some vinegar and hot sauce; the \"hot\" bbq sauce was no where near spicy and needed a few dashes of the hot sauce to get it going--along with a couple of dashes of the vinegar.  Will definitely go back, so far the best BBQ in the North West..."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews but it was slow inside yet still service took forever because the pick up n to-go orders didn't stop. Only one lady there, poor thing. We were there for 2 1/2 hours way too long. Pulled pork was yummy and brisket as well. Not a fan of ribs... Fatty, dry and tough. Hot BBQ sauce had 0 kick. Cold corn and definitely not my momma black eye peas and rice :(. Still in search of a great bbq spot in Vegas. Any ideas?"}
{"text":"This place is BBQ take-out/paper plate perfection.  The Brisket and Ribs are perfect, not needing any sauce. The Sides are good as well, an 8 oz . serving that comes with the combos puts other restaurants to shame, I had the Potato salad and Beans.  The desert was also good some kind of excellent caramel apple pie that my wife and I took home (for later) and split.  They would be getting 5 stars if only their sauce was better.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Found this place on both chowhound and yelp and had to try it since it was supposedly the \"best\" in vegas.  It did not disappoint at all.    Took ahile to get there from the strip, but did not care once I saw the buy one entree, get one free promotion. Score!  Ordered the rib dinner and got the chicken dinner free.  They weren't enforcing that 2 drink thing that was mentioned below (this was about 3 weeks ago), but either way.  I feel like I got my money's worth.  The rib dinner was about 5-6 ribs and the sides were pretty big.  The chicken dinner was a half a chicken.  Taste-wise, the ribs were nice and smoked, tender, and were very tasty.  Chicken was probably the best I have ever had.  Very delicious, and tasted good as cold leftovers later on in the day.  The sides were nothing special, as well as the rolls served with the meal.  The definite star was the meat.    I haven't had too much bbq in vegas, but this is going to be hard to top."}
{"text":"Let me start by telling you that I hate BBQ sauce.  I love delicious smoked meats but I am not a fan of this icky condiment.    Good news: BBQ sauce is served on the side at Buzz.    I ordered the 2 meat combo with brisket and sausage, fried okra and mac and cheese.  Mac and cheese was no good.  Okra was good and meats were pretty good.  Brisket was super tender, fatty, and flavorful.    They serve it up with crumbly corn muffins and rolls.  Honey butter for the corn muffins would be nice - alas, not provided.    Prices were higher than I anticipated but there is a 20% off check in offer on Yelp. Service was spotty, especially since we were 1 of 2 tables in the entire place.    Take it or leave it.  Don't know if I'll go back...but food was middle of the road in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I just got back after having the Texas Tornado w/baked beans on the side and it was all excellent.  Service was friendly, meat was all cooked properly with a great flavor, and their BBQ sauces were very tasty.  They've got both a Hot and Mild version in bottles on the tables, but the baked beans taste like they're made with the Hot variety - tasty, but something to keep in mind for those who don't like spicy stuff :)  I will definitely be going back to try their ribs."}
{"text":"I've always liked Buzz BBQ but I think the food has gotten better.  The BBQ chicken salad is my favorite, out of all the BBQ restaurants.  I also like the brisket and the sides, and I love the sauces.  I don't care for the ribs - a little too fatty for my taste."}
{"text":"If you are visiting Vegas and craving BBQ, then this is totally worth leaving the Strip for this BBQ.  The restaurant is pretty big and the staff is very friendly.  You know you are at a good BBQ restaurant when there's a roll of paper towel at each table...  My husband and I both had a pulled pork sandwich and it was so good.  The meat was flavorful, tender, and melted in my mouth.  The sandwich was huge and more than either one of us could finish.  We didn't have room for dessert.  I think this will be a regular place for us when we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Out of the way location, but worth the drive for awesome Q!    Based on fellow Yelpers recs, we checked this place out on our last Vegas trip.  My brother and  I were feeling it and we decided to split  the 4 meat sampler - chicken, ribs, pulled pork, and brisket.  All were very good, with the brisket probly being my fav. It ended up being a protein overload, but the portions were generous, with ample leftovers for another meal.  We'll definitely be back on our next Sin City outing."}
{"text":"At Buzz BBQ you can expect to be treated with respect by all of the staff and likely be greeted by the owners. Buzz gets high marks for customer service. The staff is very friendly. They are attentive. The service is quick. Always a great experience when I stop in. As for the food, it is fine. I usually get a Pig Twister sandwich (chopped brisket and andoullie sausage). Though last time I kept it simple and ordered just a brisket sandwich with no sausage. The meat is tender and smoky. There is a lot of it piled on the bun. Their beans are good but seem like they are from a can. I can't confirm that as true though. Just my opinion. The sweet tea could be sweeter but it is refreshing as is. I think the best thing I've had from Buzz is the peach cobbler. It comes out hot, sweet and sticky in a ceramic cup. Awesome. I enjoy coming to Buzz though it is not my favorite BBQ place. Still, I'm glad there is a good BBQ place near me."}
{"text":"I'll start with the service. We were seated quickly and the drinks and food came quickly. I would love to continue the praise and I would love to give more stars than 2 but sadly I cannot because I just cant rave about a 1 trick pony. I say one trick pony because the meat was great! The pulled pork meat is amazing even sauceless, the dinner portion was HUGE and my wife loved the brisket. Sadly that is all I can say positively about the food. The seemingly pre-made bread rolls and butter at the beginning of the meal would have been better to skip. The sauce was Ok but nothing to write home about. The majority of our sides were some of the most unimpressive things I have ever had. The fried okra was almost definitely pre-done and totally flavorless, the mac and cheese was missing the \"and cheese\" and was really more like mac and a slight hint of cheese, the black eyed peas and rice were just that with no addition of flavor to speak of and the supposedly best cobbler ever was so bad that my wife sent it back. The one semi-redeeming side was the collard greens as they were pretty good. We spoke to the waitress about the quality of the sides and especially the mac & cheese and her response was \"well I know that it's homemade but I don't actually watch them make it\" There was no offer of a different side or any other remedy to the deplorable quality we were extremely disappointed by this response.. They did take the cobbler off the bill but at that point I was so disappointed by the quality of the majority of the food and the lack of trying to wow us with service that I had already made the decision not to return. I have to say that when I go out to eat I really expect not just the main food item to be above boxed our stouffers quality but the sides as well. So then if you are serving a basic food like mac and cheese, if basic Kraft mac and cheese beats you hands down you are going to have a bad time. (at least with me)"}
{"text":"First time and was very satisfied!  Service was great, they even opened the door before you walked up!  Have tried A LOT of BBQ throughout US and this place did not disappoint.  Must have the brisket, nice portions and drinks included with lunch.  Next time will have to try the sandwiches which looked great.  Sweet tea a must and don't forget the homemade desserts!"}
{"text":"Disappointingly Dry...  I pulled into Buzz for a small meal after a long day at work. Which began as I walked in & was greeted by the owner, I would assume. I was then ushered to my table by an energetic waiter who enthusiastically assured me that this would be an experience of a lifetime...  I've heard that before...On to the food!   Since I was looking for a small meal I went and ordered the Texas Tornado! A mixture of three meats: beef brisket, pulled pork & andouille in a bun! A juicy temptation! My host recommended that since this was my first visit to jump into adding their zesty BBQ baked beans as a side & the southwest tea as my drink.  I was slightly flustered waiting for the waiter to take down my order, since it would seem he was multi-tasking too many things & unable to prioritize his tasks as fumbled around the dining area. I don't blame him...seems that he was the only person on the floor serving.  When my dish came out of the kitchen, it had a majestic appearance! All those layers of meat were awaiting my palate. My expectations immediately ended on the first bite...  The meat was DRY! Hence the smoky flavors of the meat were not at all prominent, if at best flat, flat, flat...Nothing stood out except for the andouille & my side order of beans. It became a chewy & swallow experience instead of the wow factor that the other reviews point out..."}
{"text":"I must begin this review with two confessions. First, my favorite cuisine is Southern food. And second, when I picked Buzz I was STARVED for meat.   What I enjoyed about Buzz:  The service was excellent. Our waiter was at once attentive, quick, and personable. For example, when I began choking on a sliver of pork rib, I used the ASL sign for water. Although he didn't know the sign, he figured it out quick enough to save me from coughing up a lung.  We endeavored into the four-meat meal-deal. We sampled: brisket, pork ribs, sausage, and catfish. Sides were slaw (vinegar-base), black-eyed peas w/ rice, and greens. We also tried the sweet tea and two cobblers, berry and peach. Every item we tried was savory and satisfying.   My only disappointment, although not huge enough to curtail my inhaling (and choking on) the meat, was the pork ribs. They were cooked past succulent. I kept eating them in hopes for those few little nibbles that retained some juice (read: fat). Most of the rib meat was like jerky, hence the choking. [Alright, a third confession: I am a mouth-breather. I choke often.]  We went to Buzz on a Friday night at dinner time. The spot was large and we had no trouble getting a table. They have a few TVs w/ some sports playing and the accompanying beer selection (albeit a limited one). The overall vibe here was chill. One of the owners was cruising the floor to check in with all the customers thereby adding an element of \"down homeyness\" to the joint.   So pack up your Wet Naps and head over to Buzz for some 4-star BBQ. Its worth the mess."}
{"text":"Lucille's is still at the top of my list for BBQ and unfortunately, Buzz isn't.  The service was phenomenal but the food was just not as impressive. It was smokey, just as any BBQ but it just lacked flavor. When I ate the meat, it just tasted like smoke. No matter how much BBQ sauce I put, the smoke was just way too over powering. I thought it was just one item, but it was everything that I tried.  I feel as though this place deserves a second chance, but for right now, I'd rather go to Ellis Island."}
{"text":"This location is CLOSED! Tried to go Wednesday at 4:45 & a sign on the door said it was now closed! We had been there several times in the past & it did seem that the quality was going down and very few diners ever."}
{"text":"I had another BBQ attack & decided to find a new place to try in the neighborhood. After a little searching I found Longhorn's BBQ on N. Rancho.  After a little looking around I found it in a little strip mall but it had just closed up at 8pm. Damn it.  Still hankering for some BBQ I recalled Buzz BBQ being somewhere of the 95 Hwy in this area and went off in search of some BBQ.  Buzz BBQ was voted #1 BBQ joint in Las Vegas 2008 and there business is proudly displaying all their new banners and even had it painted on the front doors.  It is not a small place-it actually a regualr size restaurant with lots of boothes and flat screen tv's for the sports fans. Most of the decor is Western.  The hostess was very friendly and helpful describing all the different meats and her favorites. We settled on a 3meat family meal with 2 sides & rolls. I ordered ribs(3), beef brisket and chopped pork with mac-n-cheese  & baked beans plus rolls.  We only waited 5 minutes and it was ready to go. The damage $20!  All the meats were very moist & quite smoky but not overpowering. You could not really taste any rub but it was decent meat.The ribs were large and tender but a little fatty. The chopped pork was the best thing but it had no crunchy pork skin in it. The brisket was very tender but really fatty too.  The sauce was sweet but came on the side.   The mac-n-cheese wasnt very good and the baked beans were canned.   Overall it was a little disappointing considering it's suppossedly the BEST.   For the same 3 meat 2 side combo I could have got it at CJ's for $12.99 & it was alot better there."}
{"text":"I am so full!  Full and happy!  We went to Buzz tonight because Famous Daves just didn't sound great, even though I love their wings.   My boyfriend is a bigger BBQ fan than I am, so I was wary because most items are too salty for me. They are currently offered a $19.99 deal for two people, you get to choose 3 meats, 2 sides, 2 desserts and 2 rolls.  We chose the ribs, beef brisket and pulled pork for our meats and bbq beans and sweet potato fries for our sides.  The desserts are homemade cobblers that you need to order 10 minutes before you want them to be ready with homeade ice cream!   The meats aren't pre-sauced, so you can pick the sauce and how much you use. The ribs were huge, with tons of meat and the meat actually did fall off the bone (sick of places saying their ribs are tender when you need real canine teeth to tear at the meat), the brisket was so tender we couldn't pick it up with a fork and the pulled pork was perfect.  We also ordered sweet tea and it got weak after a few refills, but it was still very very good and the sweet potato fries were sprinkled in a nice covering of cinnamon sugar and were addicting.  The cobblers were also amazing, they are individual sized it seemed and my boyfriend got the blackberry and I got the apple.  The blackberry was better tasting, but the apple had an amazing cobbler top. The ice cream on top, you could tell was homemade.   Our waitress was as nice as could be, and the other one also seemed very friendly.  Things seem to be a little disorganized, but the food baby I am currently carrying  was totally worth it."}
{"text":"TL;DR - 3.5 Stars but after flipping a coin that landed on heads, I'm bumping it up to 4 stars.  Actually I take that back after trying this out 4 stars seems too high.    I was pretty hyped to finally come here to try some ribs and some brisket, I have been pretty high on some Famous Daves for awhile now so I was hoping Buzz BBQ would be the same.  I was actually pretty disappointed.  I loved the decor in the store, pretty nice and warm.  The service was pretty good.  But I couldn't get by the taste.    With the $20 special (shared with a friend) I was able to try out Ribs, Pulled Pork, and Brisket with a side of fries and a roll.  No matter what I BBQ sauce I tried, everything except the pulled pork didn't really stand out.  It was not bad food at all, but comparing to many other places it seemed like a let down.    Overall it is a decent place and 3.5 stars would be ideal imo, the owner seems like a great fellow and I wouldn't mind trying this place out down the road.  I am really not digging the fact that nothing interesting happens when I go to restaurants and I end up writing a bland review."}
{"text":"Came here one night because \"In-N-Out\" was PACKED(like always)! The place was empty and the owner was maning the restaurants FOH by himself. I told him I wanted an order \"to go\" and he gave me some recommendations. One of the suggestions was his slow cooked Brisket, which was the best out of all we ordered, and amazing to any standards. Tender, full of flavor, and definitely left a great, lasting impression.   When going over what I wanted to order, he tried to stray me away from some of the options, which was a bit odd, but I was starving and didn't care. I should have listened. The chicken he tried steering us away from was DRY and the sauce for it didn't compliment or help it go down one bit. By far, the Brisket was the best choice and would go back solely for that one item.   Our food was ready in almost no time, and the bill was pretty inexpensive. I caught some quick glimpses of the dining room, and it wasn't anything exciting. Next time I go i'll have to sit in and get the full experience."}
{"text":"no stars!!! my daughter and her husband went here last night with a gift card we gave them . they did not honnor the card!!!! wepaid 50 dollars for!!! oh my god!!!  please everyone stay away from this shady place!!!   its a rip off"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in the mood for some BBQ since we hadn't had any great ribs since summer 2010.  After reading the reviews here, we decided to try it out.  We were definitely not disappointed.  We went at about 3PM on a Wednesday, so needless to say, it was pretty empty (post-lunch, pre-dinner hours).  The staff was very friendly and the blues music in the background was at a very comfortable level (it was mostly Stevie Ray Vaughn, fyi).    We ordered a special they have which lets 2 people eat for $20.  It included 3 meats, 2 sides, 2 rolls, and 2 desserts.  We had the ribs and brisket, then asked the waitress to choose the 3rd based on what she thought was the best.  Winds up, she chose the pulled pork.  It was all excellent and cooked perfectly.    There were two kinds of sauces (mild and hot), but we stuck with mild since it tasted so good - didn't even need the hot.    Our sides were the mac & cheese and the fried okra, both of which were very good.     For dessert, I had the apple cobbler and my girlfriend had the blackberry cobbler.  I was a little bummed that they didn't have pecan pie on the menu, but the cobblers were delicious nonetheless.    My only complaint about the place would have to be the portion sizes of the sides and the desserts.  Although, the sizes were about what you might expect for the price we were paying (2 eat for $20).  The desserts felt the same way - if I had ordered the dessert outside of the deal, I probably would have expected them to be a little bigger.  But, for what we got, it was more than fair.    Overall great experience.  This will definitely be our bbq place in the future."}
{"text":"I love Buzz BBQ.    The make tradditional slow cooked BBQ.  The pulled port is my favorite, but the rib tips and spare ribs are amazing as well.  The meat falls off the bone, when there is a bone.  The flavor is deep and smoked and throughout everything.  One of the best things is their two person specials.  for $19.99 they will give you the choice of 3 meats, 2 sides and 2 cobblers.  This is one of the few places that has a dinner for 2 that is good quality food for under $20.  I could not recommend this place highly enough.  EAT UP!!"}
{"text":"Oh my Buzz BBQ!!! How delicious can you be?! Rhetorical question... yes. I dare you to see for yourself. Or you can just be oblivious and eat BBQ elsewhere and...well... not REALLY eat BBQ.   Hubby, Baby Diva, FIL and I dined at the new location on Tropicana and Tee Pee today and were so pleasingly surprised, of course I had to share.   The Lunch Special, 3 Bone Rib Lunch, and The Twisted Pork Sandwich were all absolutely fabulous. Fresh macaroni and cheese, and baked beans were the sides of choice for the three of us adults (Baby Diva dined on the roll that came with my ribs), and needless to say there was not much talking going on at the table during the munch sessh. Too good, too perfect, and too smokey to say a word. And the prices almost make you look twice. \"Is this the 90's?\" is what came to mind a few times.   Great job Mike, you've outdone yourself with your flavorful, fall off the bone, juicy, succulent meats, and perfectly complementing sides. I hope Buzz BBQ can find room on the Henderson side of town sooner than later, cause we need some divine BBQ intervention!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ!!! My boyfriend and I wanted to try something new since we normally go to the same places over and over again, so we decided to give this place a shot. We were extremely happy with the product we got.  We were the only ones in the restaurant on a Monday around 3pm so needless to say service was great.  We ordered a beer apiece, 2 side salads (BBQ ranch is wonderful), and had the 2 for 20. Three meats ( pulled pork, brisket, and ribs) with two sides (BBQ beans and potato salad).  I have nothing negative to say about this place. My boyfriend and I both loved this place. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is good, but they are too strict with their menu.  The portions are extremely large, and they aren't very accomodating if you want a smaller portion.  Great food if you're really hungry... Avoid it if you're not."}
{"text":"For once I am pleasantly surprised by a restaurant.  This place has huge banners outside bragging about their lunch specials, so I decided to give them a shot while I was waiting for service on my car.  The lunch menu is relatively concise with two basic options:  Platters for $6.99 or Sandwiches for $5.99.  Choices are brisket, pork, chicken and a few other basic options.  Sandwiches come with one side (the usual suspects) and Platters come with the side plus a cornbread muffin.  I opted for Brisket, which I love and am relatively convinced no one knows how to cook.  When my lunch came out I had approximately 6 fairly thick slices of brisket, the french fries I ordered and the cornbread muffin.  The brisket was incredibly tender, falling off the fork.  The taste was a very fresh smoked flavor, I mixed in a touch of their BBQ sauce and I was incredibly impressed.  The cornbread had a great flavor, very soft and tasteful, the fries were pretty decent in their own right.  Upon finishing my meal the waitress commented that I had quite a bit of fat left on my plate and offered to get me more brisket.  I have never heard of a business offering more food before!  I respectfully declined because I was stuffed from the huge portions served - while the brisket was relatively fatty, I was still served a copious amount of meat.  Service was all in all good.  I came during the lunch rush and only one waitress was working.  She acknowledged me 2 or 3 times before finally making it over, which is MUCH better than being ignored.  I could clearly see she was busy, at least she acknowledged me!  She even had help from the kitchen serving tables.  I used a Yelp check-in coupon for an additional 20% off, which they happily honored.  All told, the meal plus a couple Iced Tea's, my total bill was $7.73.  I will certainly be back!"}

{"text":"Wow, I'm reading the reviews and I'm like......SERIOUSLY.  How the heck did this place get 4 and 5 star reviews?    I always pass this place driving to my uncles house and hearing bad reviews from my cousins I'm not the one to judge until I know for myself.  Well they were absolutely right.  I had the \"all you can eat\" ribs and rib tips along with collard greens and fried okra.  First off, the bbq sauce wasn't that great (okay, maybe I'm just picky), Ribs were dry and overcooked (maybe just laying around for too long) and no \"rub\" was used.  Collard greens were really salty and the fried okra was nothing special.  The only good thing was the blue raspberry ice cream they gave my daughter.    I would not recommend this place to any bbq lovers.  (They would think I'm crazy)"}
{"text":"Bottom line up front: Buzz BBQ is AWESOME!   We date dinner at the W. Tropicana restaurant last night.  These folks know their BBQ -- the food is outstanding.  We had the meat combo special (rib tips, beef ribs, and brisket), two sides (baked beans, sweet potato fries), and two small containers of wonderful fruit cobbler (apple, blueberry)."}
{"text":"This place is seriously legit. Compare to bullshit Dave's BBQ, this place is one of those low-key spots i wish existed in Southern California.  Portions and how it's serve, complete TLC, is excellent. The Dinner specials are the best!  If you're headout to vegas and in dire need of bbq to mess you up before you head out to the vegas strip, buzz will do the job!"}
{"text":"I was  turned on to this place the the super Yelp-a-licious Mistress Jade.  The hubster and I tried it out today and YUM!  I was so NOT disappointed!  We both decided to try out the Brisket Sandwich with a side of their home made potato salad.  HUGE!!!!  I couldn't finish the potato salad but managed (barely) to polish off the delicious, tender, juicy, flavorful mountain of Beef Brisket that was majestically placed between two toasted bunz.  ahhhhhhh.  Sooo good! They offer two delicious BBQ sauces; one Mild and one Hot, though the Hot really has just a slight kick to it. They are both delicious! Generous portions, FANTASTIC SERVICE!!  I neglected to get our waitresses name but she was SUPERB! So two scrumptious meals with drinks and tip came out to $21 and change.  Pretty good deal for FANTASTIC BBQ!!   We will definitely go here again!  THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION JADE!!  You da' woman!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 2 meat lunch combo with brisket and sausage.  Had heard good things about both and looking forward to trying them.  Brisket was pretty good but inexplicably dry.  There was a layer of fat on the outside which would normally mean the meat would stay fatty and moist.  But it was kind of dry - not overcooked chicken breast dry but definitely dry.  However, was tender and not the worst thing.  Sausage was really good IMO.  Maybe a bit salty but overall I liked it.  Don't understand the BBQ sauce they use there.  It's got no flavor or quick.  I had read it's vinegar based which would be great.  When I used it the hot and normal sauce were indistinguishable and if there was vinegar in it they certainly didn't use a lot.  Yet another Las Vegas BBQ joint that disappoints.  I don't understand it at all.  Buzz BBQ is even more disappointing because there is potential there if they just experimented to improve their product.  Instead, they serve a mediocre meal but I guess are busy enough not to want to mess with it."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood find.  Love their hot bbq sauce.  And amazing cobbler and ice cream."}
{"text":"The BF and I normally share a 3 meat&2 side combo and are pretty satisfied with the amount of food for $20. They sweetened the deal with a current special dinner for two which is the 3meat&2side plate with a mini cobbler dessert for each person for $19.99.   Still consistent with the meats. The smoked andouille sausage was actually better this time around- the BF was totally feeling on it. Blackberry cobbler a la mode is worth making some room. Very comforting, berryful and I like that the crust is a bit sweet and salty.   Still enjoy this place, still recommend it. I see it has hit and miss times though...I don't know if maybe the time makes a difference, but we always have a fairly good meal and good service on Sundays. It just happened by coincidence that it was always a Sunday from 5-7pm but if that's when the better people are on staff then I'll keep going at that time."}
{"text":"This place was alright, but growing up in Virginia, North Carolina, and Texas I have definitely had better BBQ.  I had the Brisket and the Andoullie Sausage.  The Briskett I think was slightly over cooked and a little mushy and but the sausage was great.   The sides where very decent and I was excited about the fact that they had fried Okra.     The problem with this place is that the prices are a little steep for what you get but hey what are ya gonna do."}
{"text":"Large amounts of meat, very tender, their service was great. They are located just up the street from me.  Although I do like Famous Daves, they have become over priced and cut back on their portions which is a BIG no no.  This place has great lunch specials, and plenty of food to go with it.  I'm not a big bbq fan by any means but their sauce was unique and had a very nice after bite to it, and their coleslaw was definitely home made (their own recipe) and was GREAT. It looked like they use balsamic vinegar in it too. It was yummy.  I would definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"Not only the best BBQ in Vegas but some of the best I've had anywhere. Couldn't recommend this place more. Great food and friendly family owned service. Come with a group and get a family meal. Good price and good amount of food. And definitely leave room for some amazing warm black berry cobbler over vanilla ice cream.   Definitely 5 stars recommended to everyone."}
{"text":"I was on my way to a delicious in n out burger lunch one day when I stumble on this restaurant. Huge sign in the front, winner of back to back best bbq in town although not the recent winner so I thought why not.  I sat down in a very funny looking restaurant that look like a barn more than an actual restaurant and thought to myself, maybe just maybe this place is not that bad. When the lunch special arrived, I love the ribs but really its nothing special.   Too smoky and the sauce are so so, absolutely no kick to it. I love famous dave better. All and all since I get to use the coupon from yelp for $25. I give it a three stars. Service is nothing to write home about and honestly. Its a one and done for me."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. And all I got to say is, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME? I've been going to that shitty sushi restaurant next door for the longest time and never once gave this place a second glance. In fact, that was where I was going tonight buuut I was in for a new adventure. And I'm glad I took it!  I walk in and I'm seated, I'm the only one there besides a group of 4 or so. I ordered the 3 meat combo, picking the brisket, the pulled pork, and the ribs. (I know, my new years resolution to be a vegetarian took a dump on me) For the sides, i got the sweet potatoes and the BBQ baked beans.  First though, the waitress brought me out sweet rolls, which were warm, squishy, and awesome. Pretty surprising, seeing as it was already closing time.  Oh yeah, Yelp needs to change this page, it closes at 7 now, not 9 pm. I walked in there at 8 like the jackass I am. I awkwardly saw it was empty and asked if they were open, she said no, but they'd still serve me anyway since the other group was there and they were still waiting for people to pick up their to-go orders. Talk about service! (Calm down bleeding hearts, I left a good tip)  The lady didn't even have an attitude about serving me. I know some places you walk in an hour before closing and they act like you just ended their world or something.  The food was great. The brisket was tender, pretty lean, and the ribs were fall-off-the-bone juicyness! Pulled pork was also a winner-winner. I dug into this meal with such fervor that about 1/4 the way through it, the waitress apologized for not bringing me the BBQ sauces sooner. WHAT? Sauce? Sauce-smosh, this dead cow/pig is so good, I didn't even notice that I didn't have any, or needed it. I accepted it just to give the tasting-a-testing. The mild sauce is your typical BBQ sauce, and the hot one has a little spice to it, almost teriyaki like. I preferred the hot one.  The beans were pretty good, I did mix alittle BBQ sauce in them to get that \"BBQ backed bean\" taste, they seemed more just baked beans. The sweet potato fries were delicious, it was interesting that they seasoned it with sugar, I've never had that before. I'm used to the olive and rosemary type seasoning for sweet potatoes, but this was a pleasant surprise.  I couldn't skip on the cobbler, so I got a blackberry one to-go, and I wasn't trying to stay too long either.  But enough of that posh-posh, the whole reason I gave this place a 5 star is cause on the way out, the teenage girl at the front counter told me \"sweet dreams!\" HAHA! YES!  I said \"....you too\" and drove all the way home laughing so hard, tears were running down my face, that was the most ADORABLE thing I've ever heard in my entire life and it totally made my crappy day a +100.  I expect a \"sweet dreams\" everytime I leave this place now! ;)"}
{"text":"I had take-out once. Food was alright, nothing spectacular. Ice water coleslaw is not my thing.   Give the place a try and find out for yourself....and write about your experience on Yelp."}
{"text":"I haven been back in a while because of the poor service from the owner.  I wanted to support this place because the food is excellent, but I cannot support poor customer service, especially from an owner. Please remember that the customers sitting in your establishment are the ones helping to pay your bills, don't take your business struggles and frustrations out on the ones that actually care to patronize your restaurant. By being a paying customer, and telling our friends positive reviews about you... we are doing our part and deserve a great customer experience."}
{"text":"the BBQ is terrible here. the chicken was so dry, i threw it out. the pulled pork met the same fate. it was just too rubbery and too dry. gross."}
{"text":"You know for a local eatery ok...but as a destination for \"good BBQ\"...it's not a destination I'd go for. Went w/ a part of 4..they have all these local write up's of their fantastic food, dating back to 2009... Well I think things have gone down hill..Had a brisket sandwich and side of vinager cole slaw..Sandwich was really basic.grilled bun & meat.  Meat as dry..had to slather it BBQ sauce on the table. Cole Slaw very sour....Service was okay nothing to warrent and over the top tip had to remind the server every time i needed a refill...Took a risk w/ the desert..blackberry cobbler as everyone was raving about it...big mistake served barely warm couldn't discern the taste of blackberries...but hey was late (7;30) probably scrapped from the last batch of the day..didn't even have a topping..not likely to return..I know it's a local place and should be supported..but next time I want BBQ it will be Famous Daves. Others had the meat salad..when all was said and done bill was over $65.00..pretty steep for 3 salads, 3 cobblers,brisket sandwich and an I tea..OH A/C was blasting was 65 degrees in the restaurant..had to go outside to warm up"}
{"text":"We've been to the old location on Tropicana that closed. It was much better.  First thing we walked in and the sign said wait to be seated, so we waited. Nobody came up. We were looked at by everyone working there, but nobody said anything. Finally I flagged someone down and they told us to sit. The only section they were seating was next to the bathrooms. It smelled like a mixture of a porto-potty and meat.   The servers--if you could call them that--were so confused as to what was going on with the tables. Nobody was our actual server or busboy. We were seen by four different people. They were all so helpful when we didn't need help, but when it came time to refill water, get the check or bring us the half of our meal we were waiting for nobody wouuld come by or even stop. The were semi-friendly, but not really.   We ordered their \"special\" 2 for $20. It is not a \"special\" it is just an item on the menu. It comes with three meats, two sides and three breads (supposed to be). We asked for double pulled pork and were told it would cost an extra $5, so we went with chicken instead. Two sides were black-eyed peas and baked beans. We waited for much longer then already cooked food should take to get to us--about 20+ minutes. I mean come on the meat is already cooked or smoked, the sides are already made sitting in their pots of whatever holding device they have and their bread is from a bag they don't make that.  Finally the food came out and the meat was good. I'd go back for the meat. The sides were good, not great. The sides were decent. We waited and waited and waited for the bread. Nobody came. Two of the four servers came by but didn't even glance at us and basically ran past us. I finally stopped someone and asked where our bread was. After some huffing and puffing the server said ok fine. A few minutes later he brought back two pathetic excuses for bread.   Food is decent. Atmosphere is smelly (like poop) and strange. Servers are rude. Food service is super slow. Portions are not big enough for what they describe. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We have eaten there and have ordered our thanksgiving turkey there twice now. We got the smoked turkey and it was a crowd pleaser! I'm not a huge BBQ fan but I love this place!"}
{"text":"Love my BBQ! Growing up in Texas, where a brisket sandwich was a regular thing, finding a place that knows how to bring out the flavors of true smokey BBQ here in Vegas was a surprise.   We first went to Buzz's back when they first open on Ann street, if you were one of the first few to remember this location, it was a small operation with the owners friendly and easy to talk with. If you ate the whole Texas Tornado, you could sign the wall. My hubby and I did that a few times.   After their move to the location off Craig, we never made it back. But just the other day, we went to Carl's Jr and right across the street, we saw a big sign advertising Buzz BBQ opening soon. So the day after opening we were there. The newest location is now Tropicana and that's just a hop, skip, and jump from our house.   And true to the original place, the brisket is perfect! It's tender and juice, with just a little fat left on for both the flavor and the moisture. It melts in your mouth. I know we'll be in regularly."}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews we purchased a $15 for $25 coupon off of Yelp and thought we'd give it a try. As we walked in I told the lady we'd need to be seated for 2 and a highchair. She appeared to ignore me, grabbed the menus and walked off while we trailed behind saying \"Sit wherever you want.\" No greeting, no hello, no type of welcoming behavior, bad start. I would later find out this woman was the \"manager\".  We sat down in the oddly quiet, bingo hall like atmosphere that has a major echo problem and is in need of serious renovation. Our server showed up 10 minutes later and was polite but not what I would consider very efficient.  After getting our order wrong on the first try they managed to get it right on the second go around. The ribs were leathery and lacking flavor with sauce you add from a bottle. The chicken fingers were obviously from a frozen bag, had way too much breading, and were burnt. The pulled pork was pretty darn good and was the best part of the meal along with the sweet potato fries.  At the end of the meal I showed our server the Yelp coupon on my phone app. She said she'd need to get the manager to look at it. She came over and stated that I needed to print it out for it to be valid otherwise I'd have to pay. I promptly showed her the email that states you can use the coupon on the app and she acquiesced. The entire time she gave a snotty attitude and really did a disservice to the owner.   After walking out of the restaurant our server came running after us saying the manager said we needed to pay our bill. I walked back in with her asking how it was possible to have a $22 bill with a $25 coupon and owe anything? She talked to the manager for a second who had plenty more attitude and our server said sorry she was mistaken. I was not happy after being accused of stealing and will never visit or refer anyone I know to this place.  Food lacking flavor and overcooked along with the manager having a terrible attitude and poor customer service. The manager's name was Denise if I heard properly, a black woman working on 4/15/12 at approximately 7pm."}
{"text":"The food is okay.. Haven't tried that many BBQ places in the area. The pulled pork had good flavor, and was moist. The chicken was dry. The desert was pretty good though. I typically don't eat cobbler, but it came with our meal. I chose the peach. The cobbler was warm, and the contrast with the vanilla ice cream was delicious. It had a great crumble on top. I've had better BBQ in other cities outside LV, but this one will fulfill that BBQ craving way better than Famous Daves."}
{"text":"The smoky aroma fills the parking lot before you walk into the most consistent BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas. The thing to order here is the Twisted Pig, Pig Twister or Texas Tornado - sandwiches with sausage and pulled pork, brisket and pulled pork, or all three. The hot link has a nice snap and a rich, robust flavor, while the pulled pork is delicately smoky and just the right amount of juiciness. Also noteworthy are the rib tips, which are fall-off-the-bone tender.  Like all good BBQ places, they serve the sauce on the side. The meat is so flavorful and moist you barely need any at all.  The sides I've had so far have been uniformly good - the potato salad and sweet potato fries are the best of the bunch.  Service is also consistently good, unremarkable but fine.  Go here. Eat well."}
{"text":"I think I found my new favorite barbecue place.  The rib tips were amazing.  In fact, I loved them so much that I don't even feel the need to try the ribs.  They were perfect.  Juicy, flavorful, and just fatty enough.  The sausage was a nice surprise.  I'm usually not impressed with sausage at barbecue joints, but this was definitely an exception.  The owner said that it was made locally, and delivered fresh every day.  He said that it was also never frozen, and I definitely believe that.  It was very juicy, and probably the best sausage I've had in a very long time. The pulled pork was pretty good.  I'm really not a huge fan of pulled pork in general, but I liked theirs.  My boyfriend was definitely a fan.   The sides left a bit to be desired, so I'm leaving one star off.  The fried okra, and potato salad were just okay, and the macaroni and cheese just wasn't all that.  The rolls are tasty though. All in all, I'm really glad we tried this place, and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Buzz was recommended to us from our Pastor Mike at Shadow Hill Baptist Church during worship service. How is that for a recommendation!  We last went in 2008 and apparently they've moved and expanded.  We liked the sampler and the sides. However I am always disappointed when a BBQ place does not have fries.  Not the best BBQ we've ever had, but it beats anything so far in San Diego, including Phils BBQ!"}
{"text":"Everytime we go to In - N - Out, we always say we have to try Buzz.  Well finally we did and boy are we glad.  The interior is nothing special although they do have plenty of tvs to view.  We ordered a family meal of brisket, pulled pork and ribs.  First off, this is way too much food for 2 adults and 1 kid. We have leftovers for a few days.  The brisket was nicely cooked with a smoke ring deep into the meet and tender parts.  The ribs were fall off the bone and the pulled pork had a ton of flavor.  The sides were good too although the Mac had too much oregano or similar spice.  This is one of the BBQ places that doesn't put the sauce on before they serve it.  I like it that way because I don't like my food drowned in sauce but others do, this way you get it the way you want.  They offer two sauces, one mildly spicy and the other hot.  Both are good but I wish they had some other options.  If this place falls short, it is because of the lack of sauce options.  As BBQ places go, this one is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Out of this world BBQ.  Great authentic BBQ in the big city, usually you can't find that but this place will definitely fill that void for you.  Best kept secret, the sweet potato fries.  Crispy, seasoned to perfection... you're meal will not be complete until you add these ;-}"}
{"text":"I went to the new location awhile back and it is okay.  If you like bbq then this place has to be on your list to try in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pork sandwich! I just wish I had the ribs here. Sauce is good, and the portions are good. The only problem was the price (too high) but hey no one's perfect."}
{"text":"meat i had the brisket and the smoked sasuage.If i was just reviewing on the meat it would be 5 stars for sure.  There sides are just gross i got the mixed veggies and they were frozen bag o veggie with no salt or seasoning or anything on them. The coleslaw tasted almost like kimche fermented and old. Even the rolls tasted like they had been sitting around for a few days.so that knocks it down three stars. For 3 of us with drinks it cost about 40$.  I suggest if you do eat here skip the sides and the bread."}
{"text":"I've been to several BBQ places in Vegas and around the USA, and I love their brisket here!! Good prices and good food is always a deal. Personally I think my ribs are better than theres though."}
{"text":"Excellent! Real BBQ ...Brisket was amazing and so were the ribs. You gotta order the sweet potato fries & potato salad. Great friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Oh my, what can I say?  I love BBQ & the dry rub style of BBQ is my fave.   If you prefer your BBQ on the 'wet' side, move along, you will not be happy here.    What hit me first upon entering the door was the sweet smell of the smokey BBQ meats.  MMmmmm, my mouth just watered thinking about it.  Second thing you notice is the decor.  It has a bit of a western barn motif going with murals that make you feel like you are out on the range, escorting a herd of 'dogies' to the auction house.  Plus there are several large screen TVs, showing a number of sports games, situated in such a way that there isn't a bad seat in the house.  As for food.  They don't have a lot to choose from, but honestly, I find that more appealing.  No need to muddy up your options.  This is BBQ land, after all.  Just give me some Beef, Pork, Chicken or Sausages and I'm happy.  Now, I've had the Rib Tips, Pork Ribs, Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket, Andouille Sausage & Catfish.  I'd suggest each one, but...If I had to pick my top three, they would be Beef Brisket, Pork Ribs and Pulled Pork.  Both the Brisket and Pork Ribs are so soft, juicy and tasty.  You will enjoy them without adding their home made BBQ sauce.  The pulled pork, while being a little 'wet', isn't overly sloppy with the sauce.  You can still taste the smoke and rub.  If you do want it sloppy, just grab some BBQ sauce and make it as sloppy as you like (This goes for any of the BBQ they have.)  For sides I'd suggest the BBQ baked beans.  Now, desert...You have a choice of 3 cobblers, Peach, Blackberry and ?.(Yea I can't remember the third flavor.)  As I love blackberry cobblers, I can't tell you much about the other two flavors.  But what I can say, if they are nearly as good as the blackberry, you will thoroughly enjoy them.  Don't forget to go 'ala mode', you will not be disappointed.  The $20 for 2 people special has to be the best deal around.  3 meats, 2 sides and 2 deserts for $20?  No way!  They must be skimping on the portions to afford that.  Not a chance!  You still get more than enough food.  If you are really hungry, then might I suggest you go the 'AYCE' route?  This has become our 'go to' restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has the best BBQ I've had so far in Vegas.  Brisket, sausage, chicken, rib tips, and ribs have all been fantastic.  I've had good luck with the sides as well.   They've recently moved to a new location which is much larger and open.  Food is still fantastic.  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is the sauce.  It's just ok and doesn't compare with the quality of their meats.  Rudy's Sause (yes that's how it's spelled) from Texas is still my favorite BBQ sauce.  Lately I've been getting take out so I can use my bottle of Rudy's at home.  I'm going to try to bring it into the restaurant and hopefully I won't get kicked out.  Wish me luck."}
{"text":"This BBQ joint is on the end of a Strip mall; it doesn't look by much but if you are nearby (my GF gets her nails down next door and I get bonus points for driving her and I earn a great lunch out of the deal so guys it pays to volunteer to be a chauffeur every now and again)  Ok, the food is top notch; great catfish; the Briquette is divine; the server was a trip and is what you expect going into a old school mom and pop dive restaurant (this is by no means a dive) it's a very intimate little restaurant sitting perhaps 50 people max.  I know they spray for bugs/rodents as the exterminator came in twice during my last visit...Just a word of advice for the managers there; schedule these guys during off hours like before you open or after you close and not during the start of your early lunch crowd; I haven't been too keen on going back since I saw the man carrying his arsenal back into the kitchen and exiting with more things than he came in with.  Your food was good but the mental image of the march of death performed by the exterminator visit was just too much for you to overcome."}
{"text":"the brisket is very dry, lacks flavor. the pulled pork lacks flavor. both meats were over cooked around the edges to the point of black. this place microwaves everything, even the roll (which i had to remind them that my lunch combo came with). the baked beans came right out of a can tastes like the store brand not even bushes. the food was very salty. you can't put salt on meat and call that seasoned. i will not return. i can microwave better food at home than this."}
{"text":"Bought the yelp deal, spend 15 for 25 dollars worth of food. Owner would not accept the deal off my phone...turn off and strike one.  However, the owner came out and talked to me, and with a 20% off yelp check in, we still got a discount.  The food is on point! Real smoke BBQ! We got the BBQ for two for twenty bucks, and it was hella food! Three meats choices and two sides.  Smoked chicken, brisket and ribs with two sides of baked beans and fried okra. Chicken was smokey and flavorful, brisket was tasty but was a little fatty, but at least it was moist, and the ribs were falling off the bone. Not the best I've ever had, but worth returning for the value."}
{"text":"Lose a star for the bad taste of soda. Lose half a star for serving the wrong food, then questioning us like we didn't know what we ordered. Then left it and got the correct side. Lose half a star for the taste of the sides. Only thing good here was the meat.  Also, one of the tvs was entertaining two kids. We could hear it over the music playing in the restaurant.   I wouldn't come back. :-("}
