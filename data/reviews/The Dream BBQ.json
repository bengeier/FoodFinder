{"text":"Good bbq.  The ribs taste great without the sauce.  The sauces are wonderful.  I especially like the honey mustard.  The mac 'n' cheese was different than what I'm used to, but it was surprisingly very good.  The potato salad was excellent, practically homemade.  my only complaints would be that 1)  the sauce was given to us on the side (I prefer to have the meat cooked in sauce) and 2) the green beans were salty.  Would definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the most fantastic bbq I've ever had! (and I've hopped across America and have had bbq in at least half the states. I LOVE BBQ) We drove down the street to the smoky clouds of meat grilling outside in huge drums. It smelled fantastic and looked the way beautifully cooked racks upon racks of ribs look. When you grab a rib off the plate you rarely get the whole thing because the meat will peel half off the bone back onto the plate. Out of this world!

The collard greens and mac and cheese deserve a poem unto themselves and the yams. OH the yams. Yams just shouldn't be cooked in any other way than that! Every piece sopping in mapley droop! 

This is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"An article about the best BBQ in Pittsburgh led me to track down The Dream BBQ.  My boyfriend loves ribs so I wanted to bring home a rack for him.  I prefer pulled pork and brisket but neither is an option at The Dream BBQ.  I purchased two full racks of ribs and a large side of the macaroni & cheese.  I selected their mild BBQ sauce and their hot BBQ sauce.  The ribs have lots of meat, a smokey flavor, and a light char. They are quite good!  
Unfortunately neither of us cared for the Mac & cheese.  I know this sounds strange but the cheese sauce flavor reminded me of the flavor of creamed corn (which I do like!).  While I definitely won't order the Mac & cheese again, I will buy their ribs as the occasional treat.  I also wish they offered either corn bread or hush puppies."}
{"text":"Visited twice and not disappointed at all. The mac and cheese is killer. Have had pork ribs and turkey ribs and both were definitely delicious. Staff is super friendly.

For those that complain that the sides they want are out - go earlier or deal with it. This is a great place and the food sells out quickly."}
{"text":"Awesome. This is what BBQ is all about. Extremely friendly people. Fair prices. Excellent food. The neighborhood is dicey and the place is is a dive, but the food makes it all okay."}
{"text":"When you're eating at a place, and a man outside stops by the window and does a sort of pantomime of licking sauce off of his fingers, with a giant smile on his face, you know you've found the neighborhood treasure. The Secret Spot. The place you might not tell people about because then it will get too crowded.
 
Tucked away on Braddock Avenue, just off of Penn into Homewood, you might live here your whole life and never find it. Sadly, often there is a Black Pittsburgh, and a White Pittsburgh, and never the twain shall meet. Mayoral candidate Bill Peduto recently pointed out that as a city, we're united at 1PM on Sunday's when the Steeler's play, and split immediately after. 

Lots of you won't want to go. Lots of you might even be afraid to drive by. Lots of you would get in and take one look at the slightly shabby decor, and turn tail and leave. Might as well stop reading if this sounds like you. 
 
The rest of us are going to get one look at the series of 55 gallon oil drum barbecue rigs set up outside, and curse ourselves for wearing white. Wishing that we'd brought some Handi-wipes as we do a U-turn. More for us, right?
 
There's a lot of room for improvement here, don't get me wrong. For one, they assume you want take out. You can stay and eat if you want, but it will be out of styrofoam boxes, with plastic forks. There could be better lighting. Lots of things could be better. The food is not on that list. 

What impressed me were the sides. Lots of barbecue places are so dialed in on the meat that they miss out on the accents that round things out. The Mac and cheese is made with real cheese, not a mix, and is wisely limited to a very mild, creamy cheddar. There's enough of a brown atop to add some nice caramelization of flavor and a bit of crunch. It's a perfect, soothing companion to the not-even-kidding-one-tiny-bit hot sauce.

The baked beans suggest to me that the owner, or one of the cooks has a little Carribean ancestry, as I believe I tasted some allspice and a dash of cinnamon in the spicy mix. These small accents are what make a place unique, and give it the character that bring customers back again and again. That's the soul in soul food. The Verve. The Kick. Art without something to say is merely just decoration. Food made with no love is not sustenance. Don't get me wrong, The Dream isn't serving health food. Not even close. But they are most definitely serving mental health food. It'll put a smile on your face on the rainiest of days."}
{"text":"Want some good ass bbq? Go here. It's good the mac n cheese is bomb, the greens are bomb. The people are cool people."}
{"text":"Visited my cousin in her new place, went to get some food.  I was completely blown away.  These are my second-favorite ribs (my first-fave are just too amazing).  I got the hot bbq sauce, greens and potato salad.  I don't even always like potato salad, but this was really, really good (all four of us agreed, including my cousin who doesn't always eat potato salad either).  The greens were amazing.  Those who tried the cababage really liked it, I heard the mac & cheese was good too.  I will be sure to return the next time I'm on that side of PA."}
{"text":"Def the best BBQ in the burgh. Service was outstanding and the honey mustard sauce is unlike any other. not to mention the meat is tender and plentiful."}
{"text":"This place fell short of expectations.  I am not sure where all the praise is coming from.  When I arrived, they were out of greens.  The ribs were tough and not tender.  The bbq sauce fell short in that it did not burst with flavor, but was just meh.  Mac & cheese was above average and the baked beans were as expected."}
{"text":"Some damn good barbecue. I had a plate with ribs & chicken. Both were tender and delicious and the BBQ sauce was good.

At this place you both order and pick up your food from a sort of buffet line with a server who gives you the items you want, and then you can either eat in the restaurant or carry out."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Yelp so I knew what to order here.  I smartly went with the ribs dinner with sides of mac n cheese and yams.  Everything was about as good as it could get.  

Please don't judge this place by its appearance or location.  You'll know you're there when you see the big drums where they are cooking up the ribs and chicken.  However, you may smell that distinctive smoke flavor in the air well before you make visual contact.  When you go inside it's a simple lunch counter with a few tables.  Inside it is very hot and smells like the inside of one of those drums.  Everyone was friendly and patient with me as a first-timer.  

I admit, I had a Google Offer that was about to expire or I might never have heard of this place.  My certificate was good for $12 and my meal was around $10.  I wasn't worried about the difference but the young man behind the counter told me to grab a drink so I'd get my money's worth.  I went with a can of Hawaiian Punch.  Great customer service along side some legit BBQ.  Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ place. I came here around 8 PM, but they were already out of turkey ribs, which is apparently one of two things that they're known for along with their delicious(?) yams and a good number of their sides. Something to note for next time (and for all those eyeing this place) that if you plan on coming here, get here when they open (3 PM Mondays, 1 PM rest of days) so that you can get a crack at just about anything you want. As this place tends to be a big hit with the locals, they apparently sell out of stuff real fast. Still, on the flip side, as I was the last customer for the night, I did end up getting at least 3 more bones than I probably would have of the normal ribs, which I think is a nice bonus. The normal ribs here are delicious. I would say that this place's ribs are on par with Showcase BBQ, which, interestingly enough, is also in the same Pittsburgh neighborhood (Homewood). Ended up picking green beans and potato salad for my sides. Both sides are solid. What I found cool about the green beans is that they cook it with turkey meat and because that's the case, the turkey juices come off during cooking and mesh with the green beans, making for quite the unexpectedly yummy flavor in these green beans. Something I should try on my own next time ... heh. Overall solid place. If you really like barbeque, you should definitely consider this place as one to visit for sure."}
{"text":"This is exactly what you expect when you think \"neighborhood BBQ\".  From the big oil drum grills cooking out on the sidewalk to the plain white sandwich bread served with the meals.  The menu is basic, but you're not coming here if you're looking for a million selections.  They do a few things, and they do them well.  Choose ribs or chicken, one of  the sides (mac and cheese, green beans, baked beans, yam), and one of three BBQ sauces (honey mustard, mild, hot) and you're all good,

The ribs were fall off the bone tender, the mac and cheese was awesome, and the sauces were perfect.  All in all, the perfect spot if all you want is some damn good BBQ. Oh, and warning: a half rack is enough to share between 2."}
{"text":"I stopped by with CM at around 8:15pm last night to get take-out.  I was originally planning to check out Showcase, since CM was headed into town and was planning to return by 7.  However, CM was late getting into town due to construction, so I suggested that we check out the Dream instead, given that they are open later, and I had my mouth set for BBQ.  At the time that we arrived, the woman working told us that the only items they had left were pork ribs, macaroni and cheese, baked beans, and green beans.  This sounded like enough to make a dinner out of for us, so we ordered a half rack with the two former items as sides, and the honey mustard BBQ sauce on the side ($16.08).

We headed back to CM's place with the food and promptly tucked in.  The ribs were large and meaty, but were a touch on the dry side, which was likely due to them having been sitting around awhile.  Nevertheless, this problem was rectified by the honey mustard sauce, which was very flavorful and had a nice kick.  Since they gave us a couple of extra pieces, we each had four bones.  The baked beans were quite sweet, and complemented the ribs well in terms of flavor.  However, the standout was the mac and cheese, which was super creamy and cheesy with tender noodles, with a great flavor that was likely lent to it by what appeared to be pork (vegetarians beware!).  This is definitely one of the best mac and cheeses I've tried in PGH (score: 9/10), so if you're a mac and cheese lover, be sure to check it out!

Overall, despite the time of our visit, CM and I were quite pleased with the quality and amount of food we received from the Dream, and the price was right.  We were both quite full after our meal, to the point that CM nearly went into a food coma.  As others have said, the place isn't much to look at (including the interior), and the neighborhood isn't the best, but if you're a serious BBQ or mac and cheese aficionado, don't be put off by that. (As a humorous aside, when we parked across the street to run in and get our food, a woman returning to one of the houses over there asked us if we were lost--a clear sign that we don't look like the locals.)  I'll have to return sometime to try the candied yams that everyone talks about, which unfortunately were sold out at the time of our visit.  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Decent bbq--you can tell they're legit from the two huge grills right outside. They have a lot of sides--the cabbage was pretty delicious, and we got the yams instead of greens because they were out of it. In terms of the ribs, we got a half slab, which was quite a lot of meat, and very good. A few portions were a bit dry, but they went well with the sauce that came with it. 

The people who work at the place were friendly, although the facilities could have used some updating. There were dead bugs near the windows and the tables didn't seem very clean. I suppose very few people eat their orders in the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"2 words, DARN GOOD, had the 1/2 rack, mac and cheese and yams, Everything was good to the last bite, I must say the location is not the nicest but it is true to its roots as a local hometown bbq, SO guys keep  up the good work and you now have a customer for life even if I have to drive 20 miles and around  the closed tunnels to get there, Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place is legit and should only be approached while the sun is up.  The first thing you see upon pulling up is smoke, smoke everywhere!!  It is awesome, all the drums are going and cooking some tasty BBQ.  The sides are better than the ribs and I give them a 5.  The ribs I give a 4 and hence a 4 overall to the restaurant.  My only complaint was the sauce seemed generic but they were cooked to melt off the bone perfection!! Though I wish they were a little crispier come to think about it.

Back to the positives: the best candied yams and tied for first collared greens I have ever had!  That is saying something since I have been to Texas and the South for some of the finest BBQ anywhere.  The mac was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at The Dream a number of times and it's awesome!!! The turkey ribs are to die for..soooooooo delicious. Make sure to show up earlier in the day before the turkey ribs run out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"you can smell it as soon as you open the car door. It hits you right in the face. I was in need of some good soul food/BBQ and this place didn't let me down. Although in a rougher area of town, their food really left me feeling satisfied like being at my auntie's house.

i can't say I was thrilled with the condition of this place. Kinda run down, no seating for guest but for family only. They were kind, helped me pick out something interesting and allowed me to swap out pork ribs for the turkey.

We ordered two chicken and rib dinner, they came with two sides as well. We choose 4 pork ribs, 2 turkey ribs and 4 pieces of chicken and for our sides we chose mac n cheese, baked beans, greens and yams. My favs were the turkey ribs especially with their honey mustard dressing, and all the sides were awesome!

The pork ribs didn't have much mea ton the bone but they turkey ribs were amazingly most with plenty of meat and flavor. The wings were just ok but they tasted better with BBQ sauce. Sweet baby rays never lets you down! Hubby preferred the pork ribs and beans with mac n cheese. 

I think we will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"I do not often leave comments but this place is so delicious. I recommend it to anyone looking for good bbq in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Maybe I came on an off day? The ribs I had were dry. The pulled pork special ($3), was flavorless and fatty. Their were some delicious aspects though: 
-wings (awesome flavor)
-bbq/hot sauce - probably the best sauce I've ever had- mix it together for perfection
-greens (amazingly seasoned)

I loved that when I walked up, dudes were outside grillin' up some magic. I'd try this place again but I was not overly impressed."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the wings and \"turkey ribs\" are very good. Great smoky flavor, just what you'd expect from the amount of smoke the sidewalk grills are producing. Even when I don't stop for food, I enjoy the smell as I drive by. 
I've only tried a couple of the sides which were average. 
Folks seem friendly enough. However! Today when I stopped by the young woman who got my food tipped herself out of my money! This girl, as she handed me my change, plucked a dollar out and dropped it in the tip bowl. I'd never seen such a thing. I always drop cash in the tip bowl and was insulted and offended by her action. That story told though, the other times I've stopped were pleasant enough and I will continue to stop for the wonderful wings and turkey ribs."}
{"text":"The greens never disappoint (if you can get them before there gone). If you have never tried Turkey Ribs, well you're in for a treat- it isn't your thanksgiving style turkey, it's full of juices, falls off the bone, and is seasoned to perfection (they go fast)! The chicken wings are good too. I'm not much of a fan of the ribs though....they've not been consistent (some days on the dry and though side), but the other meats, 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"You might miss it if you're driving too quickly, but definitely a place to try if you like ribs. We ordered a full rack of ribs and for sides we got the yams and mac & cheese. Everything was very good - lots of smoke which we like."}
{"text":"In general, the more of a hole in the wall, the better the BBQ and the dream is no exception!  Get ready to slip into dreams of diving into rivers of rich mustard BBQ sauce, and massive pre cut ribs for just $20 for a hulking rack, with the perfect balance of tender meatiness.  Creamy mac n cheese, indulgent sweet potatoes, and savory greens.  The only weaker points were the wings were dry (it was the end of the day, so this might not normally be an issue) and the potato salad was bland.  Overall rock solid, I'd come back for their ribs and mustard sauce in a heartbeat, easily the best of their kind in the city!"}
