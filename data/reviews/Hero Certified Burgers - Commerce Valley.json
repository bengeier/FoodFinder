{"text":"Not even a hero burger could save those fries. they were horrible. And the burger was no better. The signature burger is overpriced and the beef to bun ratio is way off.  Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Poor hygiene all around.  Same towels used to wipe to table, trays, Windows.  Roach  infestation in the kitchen.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"This place has made a decent attempt to offer some very different burger experience.  The bun is unlike any other place. The range of toppings is great too. As you give your order, a verbal cue to the cook is given who starts working on it right away.   My server was courteous and knowledgable. Clean space and fresh food with a very different approach.  I love this place. Probably the BEST burger I have had in a very very long time."}
{"text":"I'm a repeat customer at this location. I've been visiting the same one for 2-3 years now and still enjoy it. Definitely worth visiting. I have cousins that travel from Pickering to come here (honestly).   Always go for the hero burger (4 oz, 6 or 8 oz), all of which are delicious. The heavy hitter if you've got a big appetite and of course the delicious and extremely filling hot dogs. Poutines here are great too, but no match with big famous poutine places, but they do fortunately use beef gravy and cheese curds."}
{"text":"hero burger has always been my favourite burger chain. the burgers are done medium well and that leaves a juicy burger, especially if you order the 6 or 8 oz burgers. the toppings are fresh and the have a good variety, such as guacomole and eggs! they also have a few unique sauces such as the hero sauce. the sweet potato fries are also a bonus. further if you're looking for something else they also serve chicken burgers, salmon burgers and even veggie burgers. its not the best burger in town but for a quick bite and a meaty burge, ill choose hero."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick lunch. This is the only Hero burger location I have even been to. I loved the French fries. I thought the burger was OK. You can choose from a large list of toppings. I thought the Hero sauce was pretty good. My friend had the onion rings and liked them. Pricier than some of the other chains. The chicken burger looks good.   Tough to park here, very few spaces but you can park in the back of the building and walk around. I would go back if I have a fast food craving."}
{"text":"I would be giving this location a three-star but unfortunately I traveled there for lunch for the coveted gluten-free bun.  Of course, they did not have any gluten free buns available so my gluten-self was unhappy.  I still purchased a burger because I had already spent a good amount of my lunch time hunting for a parking spot in the busy plaza.  I actually really enjoyed my burger.  Everything was delicious and the fries are perfect.  I couldn't finish my meal and ate it as a snack for later. BUT, I couldn't believe how expensive it was!  I didn't even add any extra special toppings (or the extra dollar gluten free bun!) and my meal was almost ten dollars.  The fountain drinks are able to be filled on your own and they didn't scold me for re-filling.  Is this why it's so expensive?  I think I'll try another location and see how it goes..."}
{"text":"Sounded good...good marketing \"Contains no additives or preservatives;Raised Free Range Observes strict adherence to eliminating growth hormones,steroids or antibiotics\"  **NOTICE -NOTHING about FRESHNESS  I ordered a 4 oz burger with Lettuce Tomato, Onions, Ketchup, Mustard Relish, with cheddar cheese and strip bacon along with an order of fries. 4oz patty  = 5.29 cheddar cheese +.99 strip bacon +1.29 ultimate fries +2.99 Total 10.56 before tax  Totally failed on the burger patty : -flavor delivery (none) -Texture (cardboard) -Juiciness (none) -Mouthfeel (dry, didnt crumble like a fresh burger patty) They must use frozen patties. I've eaten more flavorful/juicy frozen patties from the superstore.  Toppings were fresh but  Cheddar cheese - honestly didnt taste it in the burger. very mild. Bacon was without flavor and small for the patty  The fries failed as well. Totally failed on -Taste (none, not even a hint of salt) -Texture (undercooked, disappointingly not crispy) They should have some type of seasoning.   No excuse for undercooked fries. Totally agree with Warren G.  Agree again with Warren G on the poor quality bun . The ideal bun should be pillowy, squishy, and tender, with a tight but soft crumb and a distinct sweetness. - my bun had none of those qualities -not fresh, not tasty. I also dont like sesame seeds - what's the point? no taste do other successful burger joints use sesame buns? mmm name one. Also oversized for the patty, which detracts from the meat even more. they definitely need to find new buns.  OVERALL - bland food, poor quality for the price. I really felt like I wasted my money. healthy food doesnt have to be bland expensive food  My burger was the worst I've had in a burger joint in Toronto. They need new fries as well.  If you want to try a fresh, tasting, high end burger, with quality fries that's reasonably priced - I would recommend South St Burger Co at Shops of Don Mills.  So far my fave, but  I certainly haven't tried them all.  *SIDENOTE-HERO gives you a coupon with purchase - $1 off milkshakes but it doesnt apply to their promotional mint chocolate milkshake, even though the coupon doesnt say it.  Another downer on my experience.    The shake was okay and not too sweet- but no where near as good as a CHICK FILA milkshake (if you're from the states)"}
{"text":"Eh all around. Photographs looked good but it was a little less than average.  Ok fries (need some salt) Burger was average.  Terrible shake. Really bad. Had a strange taste to it. Ugh.   I wouldn't return. There's got to be a better place."}
{"text":"This is the worst run Hero Burger around. Judy and I went there for an evening burger around 8:45 p.m. To make things simple we both ordered one of their promotional burgers. In Judy's case it was a Guacamole Turkey Burger, and in my case a blue cheese and mushroom burger.  We had sensed that the staff was not up to the challenge of serving the only 2 clients they had.  We were able to point at the promotional posters and say that is what we each wanted. I also ordered Onion Rings.  The order was delivered, and it could not have been more wrong. The buns were wrong, the condiments were wrong, and the onion rings had been forgotten.  We pointed this out to the cashier who had just accepted our money, and with her bare hands she open one of the burgers and lifted one side of the to argue that it was the proper burger. The grill person who appeared to be in charge began haranguing her from the kitchen. When I pointed out that the burgers were all wrong and that the onions rings where not there, both of the staffers began to argue with us.  I simply asked for my money back, at the great displeasure of the more senior member of their staff. I pointed out that she had touched one of the burgers with her hands, and that it was all wrong. I had to ask 3 times to get a refund which was grudgingly granted. This is a place to avoid as the franchisee does not know what he/she is doing."}
{"text":"I am not from the area and I've never had a Hero Burger, so maybe my expectations are off.  I ended up here because I was staying at the hotel next door, traffic looked awful, and it was one of a few options in walking distance.  The ad out front looked good...  I can say that the person working there seemed friendly.  I don't know if she was an employee or proprietor, but she was very polite.  As for the food....it was just not good.  The bread is not fresh.  And the meat feels like a pre-frozen patty that was heated up in a microwave.  And I say \"feels like\" because I could feel it.  It had a strange texture in my mouth.  At no point did I feel like I was eating a ground beef patty.  It just felt like a weird, rubbery solid."}
{"text":"Burgers were overcooked and servers did not seem to understand English very well causing delays for everyone"}
{"text":"My first experience of Hero Certified Burger was a little disappointed.   The photos and the descriptions on the website and in the store has this enticing looking meaty charcoal grilled burger is really attractive. However, in reality the burger is really meh.. the patty remind me of some processed meat similar to Burger King... There is hardly any char coaled tasted and the meat is really thin (ok I have the 4 0z.. it is my fault!)   The condiments are ok though... like the spring mix options instead of lettuce.   The bun is nice and fluffy and covered in sesame seed.. if they can have the whole wheat options, that will be nice.   French Fries are little sloggy.. I may try onion rings or sweet potato fries instead.   Signature 4oz Combo with fries ($7.99 plus tax) but I got a Wagjag $4.50 tax in.   I just don't like the seating and design of this location. Since there is only 1 set of doors opens directly into the sitting area it get really drifty and cold when people walk in and out of the restaurant. I have to wear my down jacket when I eat my burger! -0.5 star  Parking can be a problem if you come on weekends because Hero Certified Burger shares parking lot with Baton Rouge, Go For Tea, Brix and can be really busy!"}
