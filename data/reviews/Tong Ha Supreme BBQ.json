{"text":"Decided to stop by the Food Court since I was in the area. It's been a while and I noticed a new addition - Tong Ha Supreme BBQ.  Around 6pm on a Saturday, this was the only place that had a line-up... Must be good!  I'm a sucker for char siu (honey pork bbq) and the roast pork so I definitely had to get those.  At about $5.50/$6.00 per pound, that's pretty good and the flavour is top notch.  Pork bbq had a good balance of sweet and savoury - I asked for extra sauce to pour on rice.  Roast pork had very crispy skin and soft meat.  I'm loving the service!  It was very quick and I got smiles from the guy hanging the meats, the guy chopping and the guy at the cash.  Smiles at a bbq pork shop is SO RARE!  Will be recommending this place to family and friends in the area! Cash only."}
{"text":"Their tofu is fresh and delicious, and has a tendency to get sold out before I go. Boo. But when I get some, it's always great.  On my last visit (Sunday afternoon), I was a tad apprehensive about getting the char siu, because it didn't look particularly aesthetically pleasing on the outside. I'm not saying it looked bad, because it in no way looked bad. I'm just saying it didn't look quite red enough and glossy enough. I suppose I should really appreciate that it wasn't any redder, because the red comes from coloring. I ordered it anyways, because I know their char siu is usually quite on point. I was right. When he sliced up my char siu, the inside was ridiculously juicy and tender and looked absolutely incredible. It tasted incredible too. It helps that they gave us lots of that sweet, sticky glaze on top of our char siu. Mmmm. So good. And the pricing is good too. At $6.99/lb, I can get lots and lots and lots of char siu.  Yeah. I didn't wait until dinner to have some. As soon as I got home, I grabbed a toothpick and snuck a few pieces. ^-^"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times when I am in the neighbourhood.  Not the best, but hits the spot when ur in dire need of Chinese BBQ fix and in the area."}
{"text":"Ever since the food court shrunk due to the fact that they're adding another retail space, it was extremely crowded on a Tuesday afternoon. Like always, the longest lineups were at Canton Kitchen and Tong Ha BBQ.   My sister and I shared the BBQ Pork and Soya Chicken on Rice, while my grandma had the Roast Pork and Roast Duck combination on Rice. The BBQ Pork looked aesthetically pleasing, and it sure was tasty with enough flavour. The Soya Chicken was good too, however it was still pretty bloody on the inside. My grandma enjoyed the Roast Duck and Roast Pork, but said that the Pork was on the saltier side. There were barely any pieces of that crispy skin which was disappointing cause that's the best part! Both dishes were only $16 with so definitely not bad if you're looking for other options at the food court."}
{"text":"Awesome meat like your standard Guangdong duck, chicken, and BBQ pork. A lot of people come here to take the meat to-go and the sauce is deliciously good! The BBQ pork runs out very quick so take advantage of it when you can! The food is so good and rice boxes simple and worth the money."}
{"text":"I had an hour to kill before attending a yelp event so I decided to enter the food court. I didn't bother checking out the other resto, I followed the line up and ended up here and boy was I satisfied!  They specialize is duck and pork, so I had to give it a try. I ordered the roast pork and bbq duck on rice (2 items on rice). It also comes with soup and buk choy. The roast pork was super tender and flavour is amazing! My only complaint is that I didn't get enough of the crispy rind, I got like 3 crispy rinds- very disappointing! That's the best part!!! The bbq duck was flavourful but slightly chewy.   Overall great place but I want MORE CRISPY RIND dammit!!!"}
{"text":"Don't know where to get your Chinese BBQ pork fix?  I will make it easier for you.  Get your barbequed pork (cha siu) here.  Thinking also about roast pork?  You can get it here, but I would get mine from New May Hong Yuen BBQ or Yung Kee BBQ.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Chinese new year's eve pick up for bbq line up here is just as ridiculous!  But then again, would I trust a place that had no line ups on a day like today?  No.    I came to Tong Ha based on reviews and yes, it was my fault that I chose the busiest day of the year as my first time to try this place out.    Ordered: Royal chicken (whole) - skin was yellow and a bit rubbery but the meat was well-seasoned and tender. BBQ duck (whole) - crispy skin and well-seasoned meat was oh so yummy. 3 lbs of roast pork ribs - STAR OF THE SHOW!  crispy skin, juicy meat with good amount of fat to meat ratio. 2 lbs of Cha-siu - glaze was beautifully salty sweet, the meat was ho hum with too many dry pieces.  Verdict:   I would definitely return for their roast pork and the duck.  Not so sure about the cha-siu and the chicken.    Note: I was told by other patrons who were waiting in line (who are supposedly regulars at Tong Ha) that they jacked up the price for the Chinese new year.  Classy..."}
{"text":"Got the duck and it had barely any meat, just mostly bones!  Also got the roasted pork and the best part was missing! THE CRISPY SKIN! We got like 2 pieces.   Tons of BBQ places, I wouldn't recommend thus place or would I bother coming back."}
{"text":"When you see a long line up at a BBQ place, it usually means its either really good or it's really cheap. This place isn't cheap, but the food is really good.   I went here today to pick up some take out for dinner, yay for me. I love how clean and sparkly everything looked. I was instantly mesmerized by the fat juicy duck. The skin looked like it was so plump and crispy. I turn my head a little and I see the yummy  honey caramelized bbq pork that had a slight char to it. Now that's what I call a good BBQ place! I love how the bbq pork is being carefully sliced into thin even pieces instead of chopped into potato sized pieces."}
{"text":"... after lunch at Tak Fu, we decided to stop in, continue the \"b\"-day celebration and stock up on some Chinese Que.  Oh man ...  What can I say ...  For my last meal on earth ... let it be this place.  Char siu (ribs), glistening, gleaming, rich and luscious - 5/5 Taofu - 5/5 Gai Lan Vegetable 4/5 (nice garlic seasoning and ... we needed greens after all the delectable pork - don't tell my grandparents) ...  The line up stretched far because this is a popular place.  Mostly older people who remember the original store from Hong Kong.  This is pure, sheer, total decadence ... Hong Kong Q with all the trimmings - at its best and finest."}
{"text":"I now declare Tong Ha Supreme BBQ makes Supreme BBQ Pork (Cha Shiu) in Scarborough or even in GTA.  Good quality ingredients result in good products. The BBQ Pork has this perfect mix of lean and fat. So moist, so soft and so tasty! See how nice the marblization that pork has in the photos!"}
{"text":"Have been to eat here a few times already and the service and food are always solid.  Price is great as well, $6 for bbq duck meal!!! The Honey BBQ pork and duck I would recommend!"}
{"text":"My dad drove us all the way here (we don't live in Markham) to get Chinese BBQ once and if that isn't a testament to how good it is, then I don't know what is.   I don't have much to say about this place. It's good Chinese BBQ, but it's also located in a food court, so if you're looking for somewhere more private, this isn't it. If you're going for just take out, come here."}
