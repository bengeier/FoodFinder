{"text":"Sammy's Chophouse is located in Dover close to Erin Woods. Sammy's is not a big restaurant but it is a pub hidden in Dover on 34 Ave SE.  My girlfriend and I decided to give it a try since we wanted something new to try for Wing Night Monday.   Sammy's offer 15 cent per wing for a minimum order of 15 then 25 cent per wing after that until your heart desires. I didn't want to be basic so I took one for us and ordered their Brazilian Steak. I asked to get my steak to be medium but when I got it, it was well done. I didn't want to send it back because it took a while to get the food and I didn't want to wait when the restaurant isn't busy. Although plus points for having it seasoned well.   The wings on the other hand are not like your ordinary wings that you would go to a pub or any wing night restaurant, these wings are the real deal and includes the wing tips. One thing that I found disappointing was some of my wings aren't classified as \"wings\" they were breaded chicken hidden to mask out the wings texture and still count as one of 15 wings. Once again I didn't want to bother for a correction since I'm not waiting. Yes I am patient but if your restaurant is not busy and it takes a while for food to come out of the kitchen and onto your customer's table then there's an issue."}

{"text":"We have been here twice before tonight; once to eat in and once for take out. Both times we've had great, friendly service and really good food with a ridiculous price tag... ridiculous in a good way! My husband and I can eat until we're stuffed for under $20.   The crowd is as you would expect in a dingy pub hidden in Dover, but the patrons are as friendly as the staff. We enjoy coming here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't wait for reservations, forget your suit and tie. I try to get there at least once a week where you get good food at a reasonable price and a cold beer to go with it. Staff are friendly and always make time to chat with you."}
{"text":"This place simply rules. CHEAP but good food, cheap and cold beer. Friendly staff. Maybe a bit \"rough around the edges\" , but not in a repulsive overbearing way. I truly consider this place one of calgary's hidden treasures. The \"client√®le\"  here will be working class whoevers, and probably a patched biker or two. SO if youre a Joey tomatos type this may not be the place for you. But then again, why the hell not?! You MIGHT make some new friends and grab some decent grub and a brew for half what you'd pay at a hoity toity joint."}
