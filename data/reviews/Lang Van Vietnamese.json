{"text":"This has been a favorite for 13 years or more.  I have tried a lot of the menu items and have never been disappointed, but my favorite remains the make-your-own spring rolls.  A close second is the vegetable hotpot, and my children love (like squeal-out-loud love) the fried pineapple rice-- it arrives in a pineapple boat and it is delicious.  First off-- you do not come here for atmosphere.  They have gussied the place up a bit with some fake bamboo and updated posters on the walls.  The fact that you can see a run down laundromat and a car inspeciton station that may or may not be boarded up should not deter you from this spot.    Do come for the hot tea, the service, and the food.  It is outstanding.  Although, the rumor is the \"original\" Lang Van owners are now the owners of Ben Thanh (which might explain my love affair with that restaurant).  The staff is so helpful and knowledgable in assisting with food selections.  We have taken several people here for their first visit and our waitperson has always helped make selections that were enjoyed by our guests!  The food is plentiful.  You will not leave here hungry!  Flat noodles, hot pots and spring rolls are our favorites (and the aforementioned fried pineapple).  We also love the little cookies that come with the check... perfectly sweet but do have peanuts.  --This is a FUN place to bring a small group of people (6ish) to sit around a round table and share food.--  --This is a great restaurant for children to experience delicious and healthy food.  The servers dote on well-behaved children here.--"}
{"text":"My 5 stars speak for me. I'm from Charlotte and waited 43 years to eat at Lang Van at the request of a friend. Great personal service and food. I'll be back for sure and suggest you do as well."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for the first time a few weeks ago and we ended up going there 3x in the same week. Lang Van is a pretty popular restaurant here in the Queen City, but I never bothered to go since there's already 3 Vietnamese restaurants within 5 min where I live. I'm not a huge fan of pho, but the pho here is one of the best I've had. The broth is very flavorful. However, the portion was really small and there was barely any meat (all Viet restaurants do this though). I didn't like the com tam very much there was nothing special about it. The staff are very nice and attentive; they all remembered my boyfriend and me when we kept coming back and could recall what we ordered. One of the waitresses did mess up our order the last time, but the owner gave us a small discount so it was alright.   The main negative about this place is the parking. There's barely any spaces to park in especially during their busy hours, so I always avoid going here during dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Delicious, fresh  food and a huge variety of menu items makes this a must visit. I love bringing out of town guests and first timers there and seeing all of them consistently leave happy. My wife and I enjoy a warm welcome from the owner each time we go, as do many of the regulars, making it feel like we're guests in her home. Been going for almost 8 years and have yet to be disappointed.  Simply put, Lang Van rocks."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Vietnamese food, read the good reviews from other yelpers. Had the summer rolls with shrimp.  It was best I ever had.  Next was the curry with sweet potato curry sauce in coconut cream wih lemon grass, chili, white onion served with  steamed rice.  DELICIOUS ! again .    Service was very good !  Must add this to my favorite restaurants !"}
{"text":"Best tofu I have ever had! I was a vegetarian for 10 years. I would still be if I had been eating this tofu. Curry is yum. Spring rolls are excellent and the service was phenomenal! My group had a wonderful time and we definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in Charlotte! I recommend getting the summer rolls along with any pho"}
{"text":"Yes there are one trillion items on the menu, but it's all good and once you pick something yummy, the staff remembers what you chose and after you go there a few times, they will always know what you want.  the second I walk in, they ask me \"110?\" and I say \"sure\" and then about 60 seconds later, the food is in front of me.  (by the way, try #110 - it's out of this world!!)  they also fill your glass of water each time you take a sip.  at some restaurants that would be obnoxious but i find it endearing at lang van.  five stars all around for this gem at the corner of Shamrock and Eastway!"}
{"text":"The special Pho is not really special. Even when we asked for the right combination for the four of us, they brought out two small bowls that can only feed two of us."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The only and I mean the only thing I can say that they need to do is make the beer colder! It's a great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"The last three times I was here they messed up my order.  Any dish that is served with beef, pork, etc. is seriously lacking in terms of the amount of food they give you.  The food is good, not great and doesn't warrant the prices they are charging these days."}
{"text":"We went to Lang Van on our first night in Charlotte.  It was decent, but not much more.  When Im trying a Vietnamese restaurant out of town, my first instinct is to scan the menu for a short list of exoticisms, barring those precious few cant misses, like the elusive Bun Bo Hue and Com Tam Bai Mo, I like to perform an apples to apples comparison, usually starting with the staples of Pho and Summer Rolls.  Neither of these were particularly noteworthy.  There was nothing wrong with either, they just were kind of bland.  I didnt sense any additional restaurant specific taste modifications to the Pho, which I love by the way.  It was just a decent straight down the middle bowl.  Same for the summer rolls.  I was torn between giving this place a 2 or a 3, its really a 2.5  If I was hungry and I happened to by driving right by it, I would not hesitate to pull in and grab a bowl of Pho, I just wouldn't drive across town for it.  If you're on the hunt for a destination Vietnamese meal, go to Ben Thanh."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum I love it when I walk in the door and don't even need to order because the hostess always knows what I want to eat. Iced Coffee check! Tofu Vegetable soup check! Number 62 - Tofu spring rolls check! I love the atmosphere and feel of this place. It is as if I am an old friend who leaves for awhile only to come back as if I never left. The food is fresh, tasty and consistently good. You must try some version of the spring rolls and you will see why I come back to this place time and time again. You don't know what you want no problem! Someone will suggest something for you. If you know what you do not want no problem! Something will be recommend and I guarantee it will not be a mistake. The best part is the peanut cookies, fortune cookies, and tamarind candies at the end of the meal. I have actually tried to bribe the hostess where she gets the cookies from but no such luck. I guess I need to keep going back to keep my cookie addiction under control. I give this place 5 stars because their service, spring rolls and vegetarian dishes are awesome."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised!  Not in the best area of town but plenty of parking in the back.  Waitress made good suggestions.  Will go back again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, incredibly attentive service, great dinner option. Every time I've been (for dine in or to-go), the food has come out quickly, and they bring you whatever you need.  The tofu with garlic sauce is life changing, and the coconut curry dish (#45?) is amazing.  Don't let the huge menu intimidate you - if you aren't sure what you want to eat, the woman who runs the place can whip up something (just tell her what you like: chicken, beef, veggies, etc.).  And the little peanut butter cookies with the check are the perfect finish to the meal."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in a bad mood or have had a bad day, I want to go to Lang Van.  Where else do you get a hug from the owner when you walk through the door? And where they know exactly what you want even when you don't?   I love Lang Van and while it's located in a semi-shady part of town, it's worth it.  The food is always fresh and the sevice always attentive.  Plus, for my birthday they gave me a container of the peanut cookies they give you with your check. It's like visiting my mom without the guilt!"}
{"text":"This has been the best go to place for years! The lady that owns the place (I think her name is NO?) has an unreal ability to remember every guest and what they prefer to order. She is always there to greet us with a smile and a hug and has food on our table before we can sit down.  By far the BEST spring and summer rolls in the city. And the #45 is my constant go to. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Favorite Vietnamese in town.  Best thing to do is just ask the waitresses what to order, and they'll steer you right."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Fresh delicious food. And relaxing atmosphere. Enough said."}
{"text":"For a $12 Pho Det Biet it was seriously lacking in flavor and had only pitiful amounts of beef *pieces* in the soup.  The broth lacked depth and had no umami flavor at all. The only positive thing about it was the temperature but that's it. Extremely slow service did nothing to help either.   To me they rank amongst the worst made Pho in CLT, along with the likes of VietThai noodle house and the new Pho Ngon. Waste of money if you are serious at all about how a Pho should taste."}
{"text":"Really great place!  I love that they have many options for vegetarians.  Service is always really good too."}
{"text":"Great food for a fair price price.  It is a hole in the wall location, but that adds to the appeal for me.  The staff is very friendly (and fill up your water glass as soon as you have taken a sip... for better or worse).  They make great food, I would say the best Vietnamese in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"My mom lives near this restaurant and takes us every time we visit. She's a regular there and is treated like royalty from the time she walks in the door, and as her guests we are, too! My mom never orders, she just says \"bring me something good\", and it happens. I have some weird dietary issues so I told our waitress (who is one of the owners, I think??) , pointed to something on the menu that was close to what I wanted, and asked if she could have it modified for me. She replied \"no problem, I bring for you!!\" and what she brought out was A-MAZ-ING. I was so happy with my meal. We all loved it so much we went there twice during our last visit, which was only 4 days long. It feels like going over to a relative's house for dinner... a relative who can cook really, really good food!"}
{"text":"This is one the best restaurants in Charlotte. I went with a large group and the chance sample food from everyone's plate. Everything was great! The food was seasoned well and the portions were very satisfying. Do not let the exterior or interior scare you away. The menu is very extensive, so I'm sure they may miss the mark on some dishes, but that was not the case for me. My new favorite place."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Charlotte - hands down.  She is as great as is advertised here in terms of her warmth and ability to remember everyone's favorite order."}
{"text":"Lang Van was disappointing. Was on vacation with my parents, and wanted a really good pho to eat. So, took to yelp to see what restaurants had great reviews. Parking lot small and limited. Interior was ok, atmosphere was nice and casual. Services was good and attentive. I ordered the beef pho. The waiter brought out this huge bowl filled with beef broth. However, much to my surprises there was very little noodle or meat. The noodles were kid's portion. Come on now, whats a pho without noodles. Not really a pho in my opinion. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Let the manager pick your dishes if you are a big group and you won't leave hungry or disappointed.  Perfect combination of flavors in every dish. Spiciness spot on with request. Quick and friendly service. Loved the tofu and garlic sauce dish. Go early."}
{"text":"The food is all good but the lemon grass chicken is to die for. The service is friendly, quick and helpful. The soups are wonderful. This is the best Vietnamese food I have found."}
{"text":"That whole thing where sometimes you want to go where everyone knows your name.  Where here, they know your order.  Though I want to hide my glass sometimes since the wait staff will refill if you just think about taking a sip, I do love that I can just walk in, get greeted and she knows what I want already.  Just a simple same thing she asks and I nod yes.  The country soup is amazing."}
{"text":"Tom Hay Muc Xao Dau Hoa Lan$9.95 shrimp or squid sauteed with snow pea, asparagus and garlic sauce served with steam rice Always my go to, with shrimp, along with appetizer summer rolls. No one that I have recommended to has been disappointed. Yummy with great service. I started coming here in the '90's."}
{"text":"I have a running joke with friends that I take to Lang Van and that is you can order anything you want off of their 200 item menu but chances are the manager won't let you have it. Sure enough friends of mine will carefully look over the menu say what they want then the manager will shake her head and say \"no, no\" \"what do you like? Shrimp, rice? I make you something\"   If you are smart you'll go with her suggestion because the food is good! I get the same thing every time: Chicken with flat noodles (might be #105 or 106 on the menu) and vegetables + shrimp spring rolls. [sidenote* the manager always remembers me and what I ordered even if it was months ago.]  The only bad thing about Lang Van is the location (far away from most and not the safest) but the food will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Best Pho I have been able to find in Charlotte. Very traditional, super tasty. The exterior is pretty ghetto but they've done a good job transforming the interior to be more inviting.   Portions are exceptionally big, most times it'll be two meals for me. Wait staff is usually attentive and fast. Occasionally there will be a small language barrier if you want something explained on the menu. But hey, it's a traditional joint, what do you expect!? Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese restaurant ever!  Hot pot!  Get a hot pot!  Spring roll... get a spring roll!    Not hoitee toitee.  Glamorous divas probably won't like it.  edit:  I have to add on here that I haven't been to Lang Van in an embarrassingly long time.  I haven't lived in Charlotte for 10 years and have stopped at Lang Van only a couple of times since leaving.  I did frequent the place when I lived in Charlotte.  I remember EVERYTHING being great and the experience was always awesome.  I would even use it as a place to meet a lunch date with overwhelmingly successful results.  Because I haven't been to Lang Van in so long, my review is lacking in the vast amounts of information your senses process when stepping into  this restaurant.  You should read Catherine W.'s review from 2/17/2009 for a very complete and accurate account of what experiencing Lang Van is all about."}
{"text":"I will be honest. I have been coming here for years, and it never disappoints. Even now when I live almost 500 miles away, I make an effort to eat here when I come back home.  I am slowly working my way through the menu, but it will take time because I keep going back for some items.  The salads are to die for, the curry fabulous, pho is well prepared, and I could go on for days.  I admit, the Vietnamese burrito with tofu will make any diehard carnivore reevaluate, and the hot pot is fantastic.  So try something fresh, tasty, and not your mother's ho hum run of the mill Chinese buffet. Go to Lang Van and see why every person I take there becomes a regular."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for business, found this gem on Yelp.  I had traditional Pho noodle soup, which is what I always order at any Vietnamese restaurant. This was one of the better ones, the broth was full of flavor, they only serve one size bowl but it was generous.   Don't let the rather worn and dated look of the building, or the decor, scare you away. If the rest of their cuisine is as good as their Pho then it's well worth the visit.  The service was attentive, and not just friendly but downright cheerful, like they were glad you were there, without being chummy or intrusive. It was a delight to eat there, if I am ever in Charlotte again this is where I will go for Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Long story short. I came in ordered my food I was told that I would have to pay before they place my order. I had to get my wallet out of my car but she said I would have to pay first. Now how was I  going to pay without my wallet? She seemed apprehensive about putting in my order before I paid. My friend was there so she stayed back while I got my wallet. When I came back and got my food I asked do people order over the phone and have to give their credit card information. She said yes. I said I wouldn't!!! Needless to say I will never go back there again I felt like a common criminal. Customer service is not your strong suit Lang Van. And to think I stopped going to my other Vietnamese place (Pho Hoa) because you guys were closer. I've learned my lesson. What I ordered was good, the pho and fried spring rolls,  but to those of you saying I could've given them a better score must not know the importance of good customer experience. Everything plays a part in totality."}
{"text":"I'm new in town and I def will got o this place from now and on. Best pho and fresh spring rolls I've ever hard honestly. Price is fair. 3 of us with 3 meals and alcohol drinks for less than 60.  Staff was friendly and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"It would be easy to drive past and mistake Lang Van for a used car dealer, or to completely avoid the neighborhood that some deem \"scary\". Seek it out anyway. Experiencing Lang Van is worth stepping out of your comfort zone.  Inside, Muzaked Celine Dion and her cohorts tinkle in the speakers of the small dining area. The water glasses never run even the tiniest bit low, thanks to the overeager staff. The cuisine is Vietnamese, and there are over 130 choices on the menu.  Curry, coconut cream, lemon grass, onion and sweet potato mixed with chili that provides just enough residual heat to warm your lips makes an amazing Chicken Curry dish. The Vermicelli House Special bowls and Pho (beef soups) are what bring many customers back, as well as the rice paper wrapped Spring and Summer Rolls. Fresh mint, cilantro, crumbled peanuts and julienned carrots garnish many dishes, and the peanut sauce is a welcome addition to main dishes as well as the aforementioned appetizers. Crisp and chewy textures juxtaposed with tangy, sweet and salty flavors is what makes these dishes memorable.  Unfamiliar with Vietnamese food? The servers will help you make a decision. If you return a few times, the owner will know your order down to the beverage preference. If you return consistently for ten years or so, she will extricate your children from their car seats, show them off around the restaurant as if they were her own, settle them at a table, and then remember everything your entire party has ever ordered. It is like your Vietnamese mama welcoming you home with all of your favorite foods, and then sending you home with peanut cookies and a full belly.    Lang Van is located at 3019 Shamrock Drive in Charlotte, and can be reached at 704-531-9525."}
{"text":"Line was long on the Friday night we went, but they were certainly trying hard to get everyone served, so you can't be too hard on em' for that! We were happy with our choice to eat here!"}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. Always leave full. Always perfectly fresh and perfectly seasoned food. Vegetables are so good there. I have been going there since the late 1990's. I have never had a bad experience there. The food is always excellent. It is a tad pricey for Vietnamese but not too bad considering they are the best in town. The menu is big.  I have been there hundreds of times. The owner is very fiesty and she remembers everybody. She remembers people's orders after years of not visiting. When we go in there she just says ok usual for you right? and I'm like what's my usual and she tells me and I'm like yep. She also will give good advice on what to pick if you don't know the menu. Usually she will just tell you what to get just by looking at you. I get a kick out of it. She really loves her business. Clientele is very diverse. it is a hole in the wall. but they pack people in and get them out the door with no trouble"}
{"text":"I go to Lang Van whenever I 'm in town. Haven't lived in Charlotte for 5 years, but the wait staff still recognize me. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"100% AWESOME.   From the Fresh Spring Rolls to the best beef lemon grass I've ever had I am in love with this place.    Granted it's a bit of a challenge to get to, but that just ads to the charm.  Owner is so friendly and staff is beyond attentive.   One of my true favorites in Charlotte! !"}
{"text":"I've tried almost all of the pho restaurants in Charlotte and unfortunately this place is one of the worst. The Pho is bland and the meat portions in the pho dac biet ranges from 3-4 pieces. I've been here twice hoping it would change the second time around but unfortunately it hasn't. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever tried. The food is delicious, service is great and they are very friendly. Every food item is delicious and well presented in its own way. It's a must go to place for any foodie who would like to try Vietnamese cuisine . Also don't forget to try the special coffee there, it's an adventure in itself ."}
{"text":"Great food and affordable.  This was my first visit but I will definitely will be back.  There is something for everyone on the menu.  The atmosphere is welcoming and one of character- easy to converse with friends!"}
{"text":"The staff at Lang Van are so great, I confuse them with family sometimes.  Once, I found myself looking around for my leather jacket, and became alarmed when I realized the last time I had worn it was at Lang Van a week ago.  I entered the restaurant at 5pm before any customers showed up and the owner greeted me with a big grin, revealing she had kept my jacket under the register counter for the whole week.  The staff will fill your water glass with such frequency and alacrity you will be amazed.  Go three times, and the owner will remember you and what you eat.  Take your parents once, and she will always ask about them.  Do yourself a favor and just have her order for you!  The first thing she chose for me is still my favorite.  The food is amazing, but the staff at Lang Van are the best to their regular customers!"}
{"text":"World-class vietnamese. Love #49 (basically vietnamese grilled chicken salad) and #61-Curry chicken and #137-Chicken Lemon Grass. Service is higly attentive...I dare you to try and empty your water glass. Nguyen will remember what you ordered on your second visit and can even make you something special if you want to be surprised. Would eat here 3-4 nights a week if it were closer."}
{"text":"Love the owner. Besides the great food I come here for her. She treats everyone like family and genuinely cares about her guests. I almost always get the spring rolls and pho :)"}
{"text":"A good solid Vietnamese restaurant.  I must say of all the ones I've visited in Charlotte this one has the nicest atmosphere.  I was here for lunch and we had an assortment of pho and curries.  I don't do pho but my companions said it was fabulous.  My curry was really good.  I also had Vietnamese coffee, which they do well.   Parking lot is miniscule but we found a spot.  I'd go back even thought it's across town for me."}
{"text":"I come all the way from Raleigh to eat here!  Its the best Vietnamese food I have yet to try! Summer rolls are my fave!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! Every time that I go in there the owner is always personally greeting customers by their names, greeting their children and welcoming everyone.   I personally like the vegetable pho and vegetable hot pot. Mostly, I really enjoy how friendly everyone is there."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after being told this was one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town, and the staff was very friendly.  But I found the food to be overpriced and one-note; not the myriad of complex flavors that I associate with great Vietnamese food.    Maybe I ordered the wrong dishes.   Personally I think Ben Thanh or Truc are much better."}
{"text":"I really love the family feel of this place and the fact that when i came here the first time they said I hope to see you again soon and when I came back over a month later they actually remembered me and what I had eaten. the food was great and the service even better. Overall I really love this place I just wish it wasn't so far from my house."}
{"text":"Totally in love with the shrimp spring rolls here! Fresh & not too filling considering it's an appetizer! :P But, I was disappointed with how the curry turned out. It's way too sweet, not the slightest spicy and it looks pathetic - with only pieces of chicken meat and potatoes. No vegetables, no mushrooms, no add-ons in the curry. I've had better tasting main course than this restaurant."}
{"text":"Location is not in the best neighborhood. Other than that this restaurant has delicious food and a friendly staff. Great Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Oh My God. This was great. The only other place I've ever eaten Vietnamese food is the Slanted Door in San Francisco (another 'Oh My God') so I wouldn't have a clue about authenticity yada yada, but we told the waiter  a little about what we like and let him pick dishes for us. The food was sublime. Subtle, unusual, perfectly cooked. The service was friendly and fast. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What's not to love? The staff is crazy friendly & attentive. Hugs are exchanged with regulars, which is as sweet as it gets. The pho is classic - a richly flavored broth, heavy on star anise, and noodles that don't gum up or clump. It's usually busy - a great sign - but the wait is never long. Clean & cozy inside with a great vibe."}
{"text":"Like many others my wife and I have been coming here for many years, she says 10 years but it's closer to 15 or 16 now. All the stories you hear about the owner being able to remember you and your favorite dish, all true. Some say there are other Vietnamese restaurants in town that are better , well I've tried a few of them and while one may do 1 item different or better on any given day, we are truly lucky to have as many good ones as we do. Lang Van is and will remain my favorite, followed closely by Vietnam Grille.   I mean, who could resist the service here, it really is that good. The owner and staff are always happy to see you , sure beats what I have seen at other places. Did I mention the food is really good as well. Over the years on 1 or 2 occasions I though the pho may have been a little salty, but that is a personal judgement, and it has happened so rarely it is hard to fault this great little restaurant. I hope they are here another 15 years from now."}
{"text":"This place isnt that great, but I guess there are not that many Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte so its ok to eat at.  Service is ok, food ok, overall is ok.  Really, there's nothing special here."}
{"text":"Fresh and fast! And, delicious-you can tell it's a winner by the number of cars in the parking lot! Lots of dishes for us vegetarians!!"}
{"text":"I'm a first time customer and I picked up #2 & #34 for take out, the food was fresh and flavorful.  Despite the restaurant not being in the best part of town I'd go back, its definitely a hidden treasure."}
{"text":"I pass this restaurant once a week. Finally decided to dine there yesterday afternoon. The location is not so great but I can get in and out of the parking lot with ease. Love that there are large windows to allow for sunlight. Nice atmosphere and the staff is friendly and very attentive. Started with the spring rolIs for appetizer and my entrée was Curry with coconut milk, lemongrass and chicken. It was very tasty. I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food. Very friendly people. Definitely will be back. We had veg entrees and they were very well made."}
{"text":"The food is ok. I thought it was going to be spectacular but it didn't surpass my expectation. It was quick, I didn't have wait long for my food. Probably it's not 6pm yet and weekdays."}
{"text":"Lang Van is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte, hands down.  The location itself is small and not in the most appealing location, but don't let that fool you. The front lot is super small, but there's more parking in the back. The seating is really tight, but I never feel cramped. The interior is simple and square, but spruced up with stitched maps of Vietnam on the tables and bamboo shoots around the perimeter.   The service here is incredible. It's always packed, but the staff make sure to recognize and greet you as soon as you enter. There's never that many employees it seems, but they are buzzing like bees around to make sure everything is perfect. The thing that blows my mind is that my glass of ice water is never empty. As soon as I take a sip, it seems someone is there to replenish. YES!  Appetizer-wise, make sure you try the TEMPLE ROLLS. These little guys are made in heaven. They are a simple clear rice paper roll filled with super crispy tofu, lettuce, mint, and bean sprouts. What makes them special is the PEANUT SAUCE. Dear lord I could consume buckets of this nectar.  The menu is huge and has almost any Vietnamese dish you can think of and it's SUPER VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY. There's so much I wanna try but I usually get one of these 4 dishes:  Bean Curd with Lemongrass (#69): big chunks of super crispy tofu, covered in lemon grass. On top of a bed of steamed vermicelli, green leaf lettuce, bean sprouts, mint, and cucumber. This all comes with a ramekin of light sweet and sour sauce to pour over top of everything.  Tofu with Garlic Sauce (#70): This is almost just like the bowl above, but the tofu is stir-fried instead, and instead of lemongrass and sweet and sour, there's a garlic sauce.  House Special Hot Pot: LOVE. This is definitely the most filling of my favorites. The top layer is fried tofu, broccoli, cauliflour, carrots, celery, and onion. Underneath is a rice cooked with a tomato sauce... it's thick and sticky and hearty and the perfect compliment to the veggies.  Pineapple Fried Rice: This dish is pretty simple. It's a basic fried rice with tofu, pineapple, onion, egg, broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, and celery. The kicker is that it's served in an actually pineapple half/bowl.... so cool!   Your check comes with a couple packaged candies (which I do NOT like) and a couple peanut butter cookie biscuits. These little peanut bundles are DELISH, do not pass them up. When I was here last week, the owner gave my boyfriend and I a whole jar of them as a new years gift. Surely, they weren't giving them out to everyone where they? Either way, this was so so kind and generous... I LOVE YOU LANG VAN.  Edit/Update: I was recently introduced to the Vietnamese Iced Coffee at Lang Van. Delicious! They bring it a tall skinny glass out which has chilled sweet condensed milk at the bottom. At the top is a small device like a mini Vietnamese French Press. The super strong coffee drips down into the chilled milk. When finished, you stir it up and pour over your second tall glass of ice.  I'm coming here more often for lunch to get my caffeine fix. Yet another reason I love you, LV."}
{"text":"IMO, I'm not sure it gets better than this in Charlotte.  The food, service and overall staff are amazing.  I've been to LV at least 25 times, or more and have never had a bad experience.  Thank you for always being amazing and keeping the bar high!"}
{"text":"Lang Van has one of the largest menus I've seen in a while. Along with daily specials, there's something for everyone. I had the asparagus dish. Can't remember the name or number but I can remember how it tasted...THE BOMB! It had asparagus, snow peas, onions and zucchini. I added shrimp. I ate it all!!! If I could re-create that sauce at home, I'd be set for life lol. My lunch guest had the sauteed spinach special. It was sauteed spinach and a skewer of shrimp. Didn't seem like much for $14, but she enjoyed it :) Can't wait to get back. So far it's no.1 on my Vietnamese list!"}
{"text":"Great service but you will get more for your money at Pho Hoa. Out of all the vietnamese places we've been to, this had the least amount of food, (meat wise) for wayyy higher price. The manager made up for it by taking it off the check but we were spending almost $200 anyway, so it didn't really matter.  I usually don't complain unless it is really ridiculous and as you can see in our other post, we know what a real combination plate looks like. this place is only good for vegetarians and don't come for dinner because you are paying a higher price for lunch portions."}
{"text":"Out of the many Vietnamese restaurants I've had in North Carolina, this is by far my favorite. They offer an expansive menu of fresh authentic dishes for a reasonable price...including the tastiest pho! Great service and delicious food. You just can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I ordered the charbroiled pork, shredded pork, and baked egg over rice. My fiancé ordered pho dac biet. The ratings oversell this place. I love Vietnamese food but this place was a little disappointing. I think it's catered more to an Americanized pallette. The pho tasted flat with little flavor, however the ingredients were good. My pork dish was decent but the portion was smaller than I've ever seen elsewhere. I may give this place another chance but right now I leave disappointed."}
{"text":"YUUUUMMMMMYYYYYY!!!!!! service is impeccable and the food is delicious! I can only recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't know much about Vietnamese food - so I can't speak to it's authenticity compared to food eaten IN Vietnam, but as far as my Amerhican (pronounce it like it looks) taste buds are concerned, this place is WONDERFUL!! Perfect price-point for SO MUCH FOOD! And the best Pho I've eaten (in Charlotte)! But, since I'm a restaurant junkie, my favorite part of Lang Van is the service. They ALWAYS remember you. Even if you haven't been in months. Your water glass somehow always remains full, yet you haven't noticed them ever refilling it. They even \"mark\" your table with michelin star professionalism. Food is GREAT! Service is EXCEPTIONAL!! Kinda' busy and crowded if you get there during a rush, but SO worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Lang Van on accident while on my way to find another Vietnamese place. When I saw we were about to pass it, I made my friend turn around since I've heard such wonderful things about this place from good ole Yelp! I've been wanting to check this place out before but didn't want to go at it alone since I am GPS-less and not too sure about that area of town.    It was crowded for a Wednesday night-people must have came out of the wood works to come here. The restaurant itself is very clean and service was awesome. They gave us just enough time to scan the menu but didn't leave us hanging for them to come back so we could order. And they really care about hydration at Lang Van and I dig that.   But sadly, service didn't make or break the whole experience in this scenario ---I just wasn't blown away by this place as I expected to be. The food was good however I ordered a dish with bbq meatballs and ended up getting something else and when my friend tried to order one item, the lady told her that she didn't want that and suggested something else instead. So a bit confused about that whole process but perhaps I could be down for someone else deciding what I am going to get in another situation? It was just odd."}
{"text":"The food  is good. You will not be disappointed. The staff is friendly. The menu is not very surprising. I can't say it is an amazing restaurant. It is just good and overpriced for what they offer. I ordered a meal number 45. I got noodles, 4 pieces of crab, a tiny piece of beef and a tiny spring roll. The size was just right to feel not hungry, but not too full. It tasted really good. But for almost 13$ you sort of expect a little more than noodles, 4 crabs, a tiny roll and a tiny piece of meat. The meal literally cost them not more than 1.50$ -2$ to prepare.  I wished they had more soup varieties in smaller bowls as entrees. I don't want to pay 10$ and get a huge soup as I don;t always like to make a soup to my main dish. Also, I wished they had more authentic salads, like a lotus stem salad.   However, the place is clean, it was recommended to me, the staff is very friendly and make sure you have a good experience.The food tastes well.  Get there on time. It is very small and I know people like that place."}
{"text":"Divey on the outside but clean, bright and welcoming interior.  The bamboo setup is charming and the service was just right - she was attentive most of the time, but while I played the jerk and yakked on my cell phone (I'm sorry, but I got a call that I needed to take.  I think I kept my volume reasonable) she hung back.  Got a bowl of pho.  I suppose I shouldn't have, because I know you're supposed to put the cilantro in to get the full flavor, and I loathe, detest, and abhor the vile herb.  So I loaded up on sprouts, lettuce, basil and lemon, and popped in a few slivers of jalapeno.  Tasty bowl of soup, but for me, nothing to come back again and again for.  I learned to let the sprouts sit for a while so that they would soften and their uh, healthy flavor would subside.  Overall solid and enjoyable.  I might return and try something else."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  Not much to look at on the outside and not in best neighborhood but worth the extra effort.  Fast and friendly service with delicious options. Can't wait to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Lang Van doesn't look like much from the outside, and it's certainly not in the best location.  However, we had heard and read such good things about it that we had to give it a try.  We went there on a weeknight and it was crowded, so I can only imagine the waits on the weekends.  Fortunately, the restaurant has overflow parking in the back, since the front fills up pretty quickly.    The entry way and dining room is nicely laid out, considering the space it's in.  You walk down a walled hallway and there are dining rooms on either side.  I think they did a great job with the space to give it some atmosphere.  The big storefront windows allow in a lot of natural light, too.  I started with my Vietnamese favorite appetizer: summer rolls.  They're always so light-tasting, healthy, and delicious, and they come with a deliciously sweet peanut sauce.  (And they're usually very cheap!)  I always describe them as an unfried spring roll and, to me, a much better option.  I'll take them over a spring roll or egg roll any day.  The menu is HUGE.  And there are no pictures.  Unless you're VERY familiar with Vietnamese dishes, it's tough to know what to order.  We sat there for awhile, trying to decide what might be good.  I can't recall the name of it, but I ended up ordering a rice noodle dish that was full of meats, seafood, and veggies, mixed with some kind of white sauce.  It was very flavorful and fresh, and although I'd order it again, I'd love to try a variety of other Vietnamese options that I've never tried before.  Next time, though, we'll study up on the menu before we go. :)    Lastly, I must point out that the service was fast and friendly.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I adore this place and their tasty food. I've tried the noodles and they are stellar. Try the #69 if you like vegetarian. Friendly service and great prices. The spring roll app has awesome peanut sauce!!"}
{"text":"I finally made it here. I had the #3 (I think) with shrimp, mint, & lettuce in rice paper for the appetizer. It was okay but my friend  had the same appetizer but with tofu. I think his was better. I also ordered the pho with tendons & beef. It tasted like I expected but my friend ordered the vermicelli with tofu & I liked it much better. I think I'll go for anything tofu next time as I preferred it over the meat.  Service felt good but I felt rushed like they had a line outside. Overall decent place with cool decor & okay food. I'll definitely be back to give it another try."}
{"text":"I have been hearing great things about this authentic Vietnamese restaurant and decided to try on my way to PNC Pavillon for a concert. It was AWESOME! Had the fresh spring rolls with mint and fresh shrimp and veggies and the steam basket steamed with chicken and fresh vegetables! The staff very friendly and do accommodating! It will be added to my favorite list!!"}
{"text":"11/28/17-I must say that Lang Van has some of the best pho in town. It's very popular so if you plan to visit for dinner, I'd recommend going before 6pm. The menu is extensive, which can be overwhelming. No fear, the staff is super friendly and will gladly answer any questions.  I've had the spring rolls, the Pho Tai Gan, and the country soup. The spring rolls were filled with fresh ingredients and served with a mildly spiced peanut sauce. Don't skip on the sauce. The Pho Tai Gan pho soup was delicious. I would've liked the broth to be higher in temperature. That didn't stop me from turning the bowl up to get every bit of broth at the bottom of the bowl.  I loved the contrast in textures of the chewy tendon and thinly sliced beef.  I liken the country soup to a fancy chicken noodle soup, minus the egg noodle, add fresh broccoli. This dish is the perfect comfort food for any day. It was very flavorful with the perfect ratio of broth to veggies, noodles, and chicken.  Lang Van is pretty consistent in service and quality of food. If you're one who orders the same dish at your favorite restaurants, this place is for you. If you're one who likes to try new dishes at your favorite restaurants, this place is for you.  A win-win in my book."}
{"text":"There is a reason why they have such great scores from everyone, THEY ARE GREAT!  I don't go there more because I'd be broke. The food is somewhat pricey, specially if you go for lunch, but it is well worth it. Fresh ingredients and great taste. I havent had anything that I didn't like. Sometimes if you dont know what to order the waiter orders for you - trust them! they always bring you something tasty! (try the pineapple fried rice)  The coffee is great too!  A must go place in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food.  Lighter and fresher than chinese with loads of fesh salads and herbs.  Way out Eastway at Sugarceek in an old 7-11 but worth the drive and dont let the simplicity fool you.    First the Pho.  You can judge a good Vietnamese restaurant by the Pho, and this holds up well. Rich broth nicely done.    Roll your own spring rolls are entertaining and delicious (you can order pre rolled if you like).  I love the tofu version with sautéed lemon grass.   I recommend the yellow pancake also really tasty and you won't be sorry if you try it.   House special hot pot is a nice complement with a tomato based rice topped with veggies.   Chicken curry with vermicelli.   Bun.   Noodle dishes, fried rice.... I have never had anything bad here.    Iced coffee over condensed milk is like a milkshake - ummmmmm.   For the adventurous try some of the drinks like the Soursop Shake.    They get to know you if you go a couple times, but you are obviously not the only regular because they know lots of folks!"}
{"text":"Heard of this place through friends as the best Pho in Charlotte and it did not disappoint!! Very small hole in the wall type restaurant but the best Vietnamese food I've had in awhile! The Pho Thai and Pho Chan (well done beef and rice noodles) and both were amazing! Huge portions for about $10 and they have all the added sides of bean sprouts, lemons, and basil! Also nice little candy and fortune cookies at the end with the check :) I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"As a Vietnamese, I highly recommend that place. We order: - Bo bia (jicama rolls). Good. There's lettuce in it. The peanut sauce is spot on.  - lemongrass beef. Very flavorful! At times its a bit too strong - Hu tieu xao kho (number 103). VERY GOOD. The noodle and everything else was nicely cooked and seasoned  The service was great! Food came out timely."}
{"text":"I think you've gotten to know Lang Van from the other reviews. To sum up: owner with freakishly amazing memory, clean, casual, giant menu, eager service.  Scared of Vietnamese? don't be.   I was inspired to write this review because I found a new menu item today that knocked my socks off. I always liked everything fine I had at Lang Van for the past several years, but nothing that was absolutely crave-worthy except the cool make-your-own-summer-rolls with shrimp and a pile of fresh herbs they grow themselves. At $17, it better be good. For some reason I really prefer it to Ben Thanh which to me feels dirty and a little greasy.  The steamer, hot pots and ginger stir frys are fine, but branch out a little more. The pancake is pretty good, but not up to the standards I was used to. But the piece de resistance? Lemongrass Curry Beef. When I tasted it, I felt like I had been waiting for it my whole life (well at least 18 years since the last love affair with lemongrass).  I had previously gotten #100 on the menu which is just plain lemongrass and it wasn't as flavorful as I wanted. The extra little curry in #136 gave it a kick and sweetness that was perfecto!! Can't wait to eat leftovers for dinner!  5/5 definitely.   The lovely peanut cookies at the end are fun too. It's a longtime family favorite, but now it's earned it's spot as a favorite."}
{"text":"After my second time at Lang Van, I find myself to be a huge fan. Not only of just the food, but also the service.   Our second visit was on Mother's Day. I happened to be in the area to visit a job site and even though we had already ate lunch we decided to stop in and get their awesome spring rolls.  When we arrived there was a wait. Lots of families were there for Mother's day. I never knew that Vietnamese food was so popular with families...rightfully so but who knew. I had never went to a Vietnamese restaurant with my parents. Shame on you mom and dad... Well back to the review, so since we had already ate and did not feel like waiting we decided to leave. We walked around the building to go to the back parking lot and the manager ran out yelling for us to stop and said she would get us a table in a few minutes. I found that to be an amazing gesture and showed that she cared about her customer's. Because of that we decided to go back in. Sure enough we were seated in five minutes. We ordered our spring rolls and could not resist ordering a bowl of Pho. They were both amazing. One of my best restaurant experiences of all time!"}
{"text":"Lang Van is a second-look hottie.  You know, the boy/girl who, upon first inspection seems a little disheveled and oddly shoed, and only wants to talk about the first release of the first Joy Division album and you're all audible eyerolls but then:  you notice the fragile bow of their upper lip and their adorable husky laugh and the canary yellow socks that accompany their unselfconscious pigeon toes and suddenly you just want to get married?  I KNOW.  me too.  They're in a weird half-intersection that's a bit of a clusterfuck next to a used car-lot.  And because my brain hates me I was silently singing along to Whitney Houston's \"I wanna dance with somebody\" on the violin and dramatic piano muzak that was playing.  You could drive right by Lang Van and never know.    The food.  Made me want to write Neruda-style love poems about it.  Sparkling basil, mint, and cilantro flavors like new cherry blossoms on warm spicy broth saplings.  I stuffed myself to the point of discomfort simply to try and pinpoint where the star anise flavor ended and the beef began.  The pho is better than any you've ever had.  Swear.  Top 5: -The pho.  doye. -the do it yourself spring roll things with the bowl of hot water.  do it. -Banh Xeo, yellow pancake.   -Crispy quail. -The specials.  Enjoy it for me when you go because I only get it like once a year."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food and service.   Highly recommend the Summer Rolls and Pho Tai. There is a chicken soup that is also very good. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.  Arrive early on Friday and Saturday, as you will most likely have to wait to be seated. That said, it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great spot for some Vietnamese! I went with a friend wondering how the place would be like. The  place was pretty packed especially considering it doesn't have the best location. The menu was a bit confusing - they have stir fried noodle dish under rice dish category. But the waitresses helped us find the dishes we wanted pretty quick. Id say the highlight of the dinner was the Jicama roll - it was not something I'd had in other Vietnamese restaurants but was absolutely delicious and reminded me of China since it has Chinese sausage in the rice paper wrap. The service was awesome and I enjoyed the little dessert and candy besides fortune cookie at the end of the meal. Will definitely come back with my Vietnamese friends to check its authenticity next time!"}
{"text":"Overall had a good lunch experience , just one suggestion ... More meat...more meat!  Customer service was great!  Pho Dac Biet review  Pros -broth smells good, tastes pretty good  Cons -Literally had no Tripe and no tendons! -a bit pricey for the amount of noodles and meat"}
{"text":"Affordable, consistently excellent good. Lack of atmosphere is made up by the owner who is constantly on the floor making sure customers are happy. She will even make custom orders to your liking."}
{"text":"We've tried a lot of the Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte and in our opinion this restaurant is a ten while the others are a five or six.  The food is very high quality, great taste, super friendly staff, and it has a nice family style atmosphere.  My only complaint is I wish they were closer to my home.  We sometimes try other Vietnamese restaurants because they are closer, but we always go back to Lang Van (at least 40 miles from our home)."}
{"text":"Very bad service. We basically got ignored all the time. They obviously are busy serving the guest they think are important. I am so surprised this place got such high ratings. The food is only so-so and expensive for its taste.   Won't come again."}
{"text":"The only reason I can't give Lang Van 5 stars is because of the location and exterior of the building.  I know it's wrong to judge like that, but seriously, until the food is in front of you it's a scary place.  But the food.  OMG the food.  Fresh, light, perfectly seasoned and plentiful.  The service is amazing - in fact, I rarely order straight from the menu.  The wait staff seem to love offering to \"make for you special\" if you just tell them what you like.    I love veggies, and I've never had fresher, more perfectly cooked veggies in all of Charlotte.  The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable, helpful and patient with those of us that aren't very familiar with vietnamese, and they do a wonderful job explaining things and offering alternatives.  If you haven't been, GO, but I would recommend going for lunch instead of dinner just to make sure it's daylight outside. ;-)  I love the pineapple fried rice (with no tofu and extra veggies), and my husband loves #90.  GO!"}
{"text":"Like alot of Vietnamese restaurants in North Carolina, this one is a bit off the beaten path (at least from the parts of Charlotte I usually go to). But unlike alot of those same Vietnamese restaurants, the interior of this one (tables, floors, chairs, bathrooms) is immaculate. Also, the level and friendliness of service is higher here than most Vietnamese restaurants. I could not help but notice the number of people the hostess (owner?) knew and welcomed back. Repeat business is one of the best endorsements a restaurant can get.  In terms of the food, it was on par with other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to. We ordered the hot pot and a vermicelli bowl. Both solid dishes. Would go again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte.  The staff is very attentive and after only a few visits the manager recognizes us and knows what we like to drink and knows our appetizer. We love the spring rolls with the peanut sauce.  I have tried  quite a few of the many dishes they offer, including the specialties, but I seem to always prefer the vermicelli dishes with mint. It is light and refreshing."}
{"text":"The best Bun salad and spring rolls ever. I enjoy coming here for years. I also enjoy the Pho soup too. The lemongrass curry chicken is delicious as well.  Now the sweet tea is sooo good! Freshly brewed tea. Amazing."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best Pho in Charlotte. I would go here for brunch just for the pho and iced coffee after a night of partying. So good. Always."}
{"text":"Hangs down best Vietnamese in the country.  Best phu, wonton soup and chicken curry ever!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this Vietnamese restaurant, I've recommended it to several coworkers and we dine here at least once a month now. My favorite food items so far are the pancake (as appetizer to share) and the curry chicken vermicelli.   What I love about Lang Van: + Great service, all the servers genuinely love working there and are happy to serve you + Authentic Vietnamese food  + Huge menu with a variety of options. It's not just the usual Pho, there are a ton of other things to choose from (including more than 10 vegetarian options) + Food tastes amazing  + Good prices, you can get an entrée and beer and share appetizers and pay ~$20 per persn + Cheap Asian beer :) I think it's $3.75 for Singaporean beer + Busy but usually an empty table available for you or a very short wait + Servers give great food recommendations based on your preferences (e.g. spicy..... noodles..... )  Highly recommend this to everyone, you won't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been told this is the best Vietnamese in Charlotte, and it's true!  The restaurant is small and while waiting in line you can see all of the guests eating.  You aren't allowed to put your name on a list, you just wait in line.  The food is worth the wait though! They will make anything you like; I wanted pho with shrimp = delicious!  The Vietnamese iced tea was also delicious...and I don't like tea! The service was excellent...our glasses were constantly filled! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & several friends rave about how good Pho is & still yet, I was nervous about it...well today was so cold & gloomy, I decided today was going to be the day to try Pho for the first time!  My boyfriend is a regular at Lang Van & knew I would be comfortable there. He was right! While Lang Vang is not in the most prominent area of Charlotte, it is a popular spot. It's small, but very intimate. The decor is warm & cozy...the bamboo \"fence\" at the entrance is nice!  I LOVE fresh spring rolls & Lang Van's are amazing!  The accompanied peanut sauce wasn't what I am used to, but it had a mild kick to it & worked well with the rolls. They rolls are a decent size, too, full of ingredients & rolled up tight.   Sweet tea...WOW! It was just the right amount of sweet. I think we both had like 4 glasses each.    The Pho...we had the #37  - which features the well cooked steak. In under 5 minutes our plate of basil, mint, lemon, bean sprouts, & jalapeños & large bowls of glorious Pho were on our table.  I immediately fell in love with this soup.  I'm already looking forward to eating it again.  Restaurant was clean & catchy music played overhead, but wasn't overpowering.  The owner was so nice & friendly. Waiters & waitresses were fast & efficient, clearing off tables quickly & constantly filling up drinks.  As Chad mentioned, they don't have much for parking, so be mindful of that.  I'm especially pleased at ow fast we got in & out, as I was on a time crunch trying to get to a yelp event. :)  I was impressed with the peanut cookies & candy on a cute little dish on our \"bill plate\" (for lack of a better title!) AND fortune cookies!   Funny that Nick said the staff knows what he wants when he comes in! It was the same for my boyfriend & we have friends that say the same experience.  How's that for customer service?!  I'm really pleased with Lang Van...I'll definitely be back. Yay for my first Pho experience!"}
{"text":"Even if you don't know what vietnamese food is you have to try Lang Van.  I have been here quite a few times but not in a while and I'm so glad I came back.  I've actually never ordered off the menu until the other night, normally I just tell the friendly waitress what I like and she brings me back something delicious.   I highly recommend the lemongrass curry and steamed shrimp spring rolls delicious.  This restaurant is at the top of my list.  This place is also great if your looking for a quick dinner they can have you in and out in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"How in the ever-loving, joyous world of immeasurably delectable Vietnamese cuisine have I not reviewed Lang Van until this day?!?! Upon my visit last night, I was astonished at my lack of review. Well, as they say, better late than never.  I've been a patron of Lang Van for years and have never had an experience where the food, service, and company have not been unique, memorable and utterly satisfying. The owner(?) or manager is one of the friendliest people in all of the Queen City. Regardless if you visited this week, late 2012, or even 5 years ago, she'll remember your face. She'll come up to you and give you a hug, welcome you, ask how your family is, and then hastily launch into bringing you a menagerie of Vietnamese foodstuffs.   The menu, which is not for the faint of heart, houses an abundance of options. I used to order anything with coconut curry or just the simple Pho, but the owner (I really need to remember her name!) simply asks me what I'm in the mood for, proceeds to list options -- \"What do you like? What do you want? Do you like crispy tofu? Do you like noodles? Coconut Curry? Vegetables? Meat or no meat?.....Ok, I'll bring you something nice.\" --------- THAT is why Lang Van is an incredible experience every single time. Not even seeing a menu anymore is a dream come true.   Recently, I was introduced to Vietnamese coffee. Check out my photo or some of the others. It's an experience to be had. Condensed milk, a small urn of drip coffee...strong coffee above a tall glass with ice. Truly amazing.   Lang Van is a staple in Charlotte's Vietnamese dining scene...nay. Overall. If you're even close to the line of wanting to try Vietnamese cuisine, start here."}
{"text":"This review would have been a five, but I was disappointed with the spring rolls and peanut sauce. The rolls needed more flavor and less boring lettuce. However, my noodle dish was absolutely perfect and delicious. I got #72. The fried tofu was so crispy, with a creamy inside. The dish was packed with flavor and just the right amount of wetness. I can't wait to go back and try something else! The staff was so sweet."}
{"text":"Helpful Hints:   -Don't judge a restaurant by its location-Shamrock and Eastway is an unlikely spot for an exceptional restaurant, but its not impossible.  -If you don't understand the menu (and not every dish is explained in English), just ask.   -Though the staff seems hurried, they will take time to explain the differences between the dishes.   -The owner might seem gruff, but she's really a nice lady. -If you wanna impress your date with exotic food, Lang Van is a safe bet.  They cater to to an American clientele and speak English well.    -You can trust a four-star review of a Vietnamese restaurant from someone whose gets regular cravings for un-sexy foods like grilled hamburgers and homemade onion rings."}
{"text":"Lang Van is some of the best Vietnamese food I've ever had (next to my friend's mom's house). Get the pho and ask for them to make it spicy...and make sure to specify Vietnamese spicy, not white people spicy."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food I've had in awhile. A little pricy for the hot pot (around $30), but the pho is only around $10 and is just as good."}
{"text":"Excellent pho. Loved the spring rolls...basil and mint really taste so fresh with the perfectly cooked shrimp.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Having lived in San Jose, CA and Westminster, CA (the two largest Vietnamese communities in the US) as well as the actual country of Vietnam, I can tell you that this place has AUTHENTIC spring rolls.  It is light and tastes delicious.  This is something that is extremely rare, even in California where all the V's reside.    I ordered the hu tieu xao dac biet (forgot what its called in English) and it was very good too.  There were 3 or 4 types of meat in it and some of it was a bit overcooked but that's pretty normal for a dish like this (since they cook everything together) unless you're paying top dollar for it.  The noodles, however were AMAZING.  Cooked to perfection and it had a great flavor to it.    Service was excellent.  Everyone was extremely nice and multiple servers came by to check up on us even though it was busy that day.  Overall, this place is great if you want some authentic Vietnamese food and offers a very fair price."}
{"text":"Not only is this one of the best restaurants in Charlotte but the service here is also incredible, it will be busy here so plan ahead and go during off hours if you're in a hurry but they work efficiently and turn tables fast so even if the line looks long, you'll get in more quickly than you expect.  The menu is incredibly extensive-like 7 pages long. It could be overwhelming for those not used to Vietnamese food but luckily,  everything is good! My favorites are the lemongrass tofu and garlic tofu dishes but they also have plenty of good non vegetarian dishes if you prefer meat. My fiancée got a stuffed pineapple dish with shrimp and vegetables last time we went and he really enjoyed it (and it was so pretty too!). Anything with pork is also good here. I'm not supposed to eat pork due to allergies and pork's not usually my thing anyway but I make an exception for Lang Van's summer rolls with pork. I can deal with some itchiness and discomfort in exchange for the deliciousness :)  A trip here isn't complete without having one of the fruit smoothies. In addition to the usual  fruits, they also offer more exotic choices such as soursop and durian.   A meal here is capped off with a small plate of complimentary desserts-usually peanut butter cookies, tamarind candies, and fortune cookies. During my last trip here, they even gave the customers a thanksgiving treat in the form of an entire jar of the peanut butter cookies! They really know how to make customers feel special and appreciated!"}
{"text":"All the years I've been in Charlotte and even at one point lived not far from this place......I never knew Lang Van was there. and not quite sure how I missed it.  After visiting Ben Thanh a few times I wanted to give it try.  I like the pho at Ben Thanh better but the vermicelli dishes and service here are simply superb......It took me forever to decide what to order and my waitress was so patient and sweet and even suggested a few items but of course I wanted a sample everything on the menu.  My new Vietnamese fav at the moment....."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place.  The staff is friendly, the menu is wide and varied and the food is affordable and bursting with flavor.  It's clean, well-run and about the only negative I can muster is that it's out in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"I'm on the edge of giving Lang Van a fifth star - they're that good, but I hesitated and have decided to go the conservative route.  The food here is EXCELLENT!  We moved to Charlotte from San Francisco this year and we were lamenting finding good Asian food here.  The jury is still out on good Chinese food.  However for Vietnamese, there's no question - Lang Van is by far the best I've had.  Their menu is full of diverse and authentic choices.  They use great fresh ingredients.  Service at Lang Van is very friendly and helpful.  We will make this a regular spot on our dining out roster!"}
{"text":"Umm yes please, two please! For real though... The pho is ok. I still haven't found a place better than Viet Thai for pho. It was ok though. The business was the special stir fry chicken and veggies with ginger sauce on the side. I know that sounds average but this was perfection! No sauce needed. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Food: Summer rolls and crispy egg noodles with vegetables, meats and seafood. #112.  The summer rolls with boiled shrimp and peanut sauce is always a hit at Vietnamese places and this is no exception. The only issue I had was that they used iceberg instead of romance lettuce as the filler, which doesn't look at appetizing.  Overall, the entree was good. They gave plenty of food and for someone who wasn't as hungry as me, it'd likely serve as a meal plus a decent bit of leftovers. I couldn't really find much to complain about during my visit.  The best part of this restaurant has to be the table decorations though: a nice stitched map of Vietnam under the glass at most tables. This added a wonderfully personal touch to the decor of the place."}
{"text":"#103 is unbelievable!! Sub mix veggies for the choy sum.   Lang Van is the best!  Service is awesome.  Staff is beyond friendly and if you dont know what you want just tell them what you like and they will tell you what dish.  It is awesome.  My mom went with her book club and they had no clue what to get.  The staff brought them an appetizer, then brought them three entrees to share.  They all loved it. DO NOT LET THE LOCATION FOOL YOU!!!"}
{"text":"this is the best vietnamese restaurant in town! despite the neighborhood where its located i would definetely go there whenever im craving good food!  The Pho is VERY GOOD and my favorite appetizer (not sure what its called) but they bring you a plate full of herbs and grilled (sort of) chicken kebab. You can put this inside some rice \"asian tortillas\"  (lol) that you deep into water to make them softer.. its amazing!"}
{"text":"So, I have to update this since my last review because 1) I went to Vietnam Grille on South and 2) I tried Lang Van again.  What I had at Lang Van was oh-so-better at Vietnam Grille - had more flavor & tasted fresher.  Also, my companion found a hair in his soup at LV.  Service was much better this time."}
{"text":"If you know pho, you would know their broth is from a can.  Go dumpster dive in the back and I bet you will find those cans. I have eaten literally a thousand bowls of pho from largest viet communities in orange county, seattle and all over vietnam, so I kind of know what I am talking about.  Their steak meat isn't even the right thickness.  This is consistent with my hypothesis that if the menu is too big, it is difficult to make everything tasty.  They charge $12 for a vermicelli bowl. Wtf, seriously? The fish sauce a bit on the vinegary side too.  You are just paying a premium for the wine-glassed water and cloth napkins.  Their spring rolls are ugly but tasty, but the again, any idiot can make good spring rolls.  You just need fresh ingredients and a decent sauce.  For pho, go to Pho Hoa.  I am sure every pho hoa in the nation boils their own broth.  I feel so bad for these folks who love this restaurant so much."}
{"text":"I've been coming here as long as I can remember; at least 10 years. The best service ever. I can go to a restaurant that charges three times as much, and invariably leave thinking that I would have received better service at Lang Van. As previous reviews on here state, they remember every dish you have ordered, and are genuinely happy to see you. Or they're just darn good actors. But so many other places don't bother to put out that kind of effort.  Sure, Pho Hoa has better pho, and nothing compares to the profuse amount of tendon that is in Vietnam Grilles tendon pho.  While I do wish they would give you lime instead of lemon, I don't really come here for the pho; but do order it when it's cold. Having said that this past visit the pho was much better than usual, with a roasted onion flavor that I really enjoyed. The soup arrived quickly and hit the spot.  The best dish they have is the lotus root salad; it is the perfect summer dish. Roasted pork and shrimp served on top of some kind of puffy rice cracker thing, with lots of crunchy lotus root. The rice cracker things are light and crispy; the perfect amount of food; you don't leave feeling like you have overdosed on carbs.  Here's to another 10 years!"}
{"text":"After spending the early afternoon at the Charlotte Museum of History, my husband and I found Lang Van nearby. (We ran into another group that just finished the museum there as well. I'm sure that happens often.)  Similar to other reviews, the outside of the building is very plain. However, as we walked in there are decorations of bamboo sticking up around the tables and it was open and bright. We received a warm greeting.  The menu is a bit overwhelming because they offer over 130 items to choose from. Some dishes (mainly vegetarian) were just under $10, while many dishes were $11 to $15. We ordered #2 Summer roll for an appetizer and the Green beans and tofu (based on a prior review and it was a recommendation of our server).   The Summer roll was great! Just enough for us to both try one. The dipping sauce was delicious. The green beans and tofu was very good. I'm not a big fan of a lot of onions, so I had to pick around them in this dish. The tofu was great. The portion was enough for us to share and we were very full at the end.   We received a lot of attention and our glasses of water never ran dry! The little cookies at the end (when we got the bill) were a nice little treat...just the right amount of sweet. We will definitely return over and over again so we can begin to try more of their many dishes."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The girls that work here are all so nice!  They are whizzing around the room at all times, topping up drinks and turning over tables. I have never been when there was not a wait. The food is light and always very fresh. The menu is very expansive, do not be afraid to ask for recommendations. They will be happy to help. Summer rolls are the best I have ever had. The quail appetizer is very good, served as a whole breast (a teeny tiny breast) and with lemon, salt and pepper to dip into. Very different, very tasty.  I almost always get the same entree #45. Vermicelli noodles with shrimp and pork over a delicate salad of iceberg, mint and cucumber, served with a citrusy dressing and carrot slaw. My husband gets #103 a spicy stir fry with everything in it.  The fried rice is also the best I have ever had. Vietnamese beer is crisp and delicious.  They do not offer dessert, you could try a sweet a Vietnamese iced coffee, or not.  A peanut butter biscuit and fortune cookie come with the check to finish off a perfect meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I made the trek to East Charlotte to visit Lang Van, having heard rave reviews and even assertions that this is \"the best Vietnamese food in Charlotte.\" Needless to say, we had high hopes. While our hopes certainly were not dashed, we both felt that our food was in solid \"good-not-great\" territory. We started with the fried spring rolls and as soon as they landed at our table, we wished we had ordered the fresh summer rolls or garden delight rolls. The spring rolls were very small and typical fried Asian roll fare. Nothing to write home about, especially for $3.25! I ordered the vegetarian house special hot pot, which included fresh veggies and nicely fried tofu over tasty tomatoey rice. It was satisfying and fresh, but nothing special. We split the banh xeo (yellow pancake stuffed with pork and bean sprouts), and found it to be decent enough but not spectacular. My boyfriend ordered the pho dac biet (beef, tendon, and meatball) and said that his bowl didn't have enough noodles and was not exceptionally flavorful in any way. We left relatively satisfied, but certainly not feeling that the \"best in Charlotte\" reputation or the drive there was worthy."}
{"text":"It's a hidden gem... well, it's always packed so I guess it isn't all that hidden. I love everything about this place: the authenticity of the food, the fast pace of the servers, the four fortune cookies you get with your order. It's perfect. The shrimp pho and summer rolls are the best. Ask for hoisin sauce."}
{"text":"Lang Van has been around a long time. They have this food thing down. I've only been for lunch so will only speak to that in my review.  Ok. Yes. You may have a hard time finding a parking spot, as I did the last time. But, there are so many patrons dining that one car is bound to leave soon after you get there so stick it out. If you do, you will receive a warm welcome and you will be shuttled to a table promptly, as long as one is available. There is not much room to wait for a table.  Once seated, check out the many offerings! They have roll your own summer rolls with rice paper wraps that you need to soften with the bowl of hot water. I opted for the ready rolled ones (2 to an order there so easier to eat as just one person).  The pineapple fried rice is a popular, and comforting dish, served in half a pineapple.  This week I opted for Tai Pho. Sweeter broth than I'm used to with pho but fresh accompaniments were delish; bean sprouts, jalapeños, cilantro, Thai basil and lemon. I've always gotten limes at other restaurants. I'd order it again. Lots of love and attention went into that broth.  I also love the peanut or almond cookie they give you at the end of the meal. I fight my friends for them."}
{"text":"It's not just the food that made me come back to this place many times. They have EXCEPTIONAL service and I mean it! I have never been so satisfied about both my food and my service so much I walked out the door smiling all the way home. If you haven't been here yet then what are you doing?? Go here! And go often!"}
{"text":"Best pho I've found in Charlotte. I doesn't look like much from the outside, but once inside I found it pleasant. Certainly not a fancy place, but the staff has always been attentive. They once overcharged me but I didn't notice. On my next visit, the manager made a point to welcome us back and delivered cash to our table in the amount we were overbilled. I was impressed with their integrity."}
{"text":"Dined here at lunch with a customer- at their suggestion. The spring rolls were fantastic, dipped in the peanut sauce.  The Pho was delicious as well. The staff and owner make the whole experience great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't come if you plan on on using a credit card. I came for lunch. Service was slow, food was passable. I got the summer roll and chicken curry. Portions were small and curry was mostly sauce and very little chicken for a $10 dish. Flavors were lacking. Service was slow in spite of a nearly empty restaurant.   When the card machine wasn't working, they ran two other cards telling me that my first was declined in spite of being thousands of dollars away from the credit limit.   I get it. It's not their fault their machine isn't working. They keep telling me \"5 more minutes\". I've been waiting over 30min now and the proposed solution is that they write down my credit card number and charge me so I can leave. I offered to pay them via PayPal or Venmo, none of the employees had any idea what I was talking about. Apple Pay, forget it. I mean seriously, even my parents have Venmo.  I would be more understanding if there was any effort to show good will for the inconvenience. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Not deserving it's 4-star rating. Decor is lacking. It's a favorite for local hipsters and self-loathing yuppies types. I've had much better Pho. Broth doesn't seem made there, no flavor, not a lot of meat in each bowl. On top of this, it's quite expensive for Pho served in a cinder-box."}
{"text":"For Vietnamese in Charlotte, Lang Van's is only one of two places that give you all the variety that IS Vietnamese cuisine.  From noodle soups, to stir-fries, pancakes and curries-they have them ALL!  Tremendous variety of tofu and complete vegetarian options.  All quickly and with a smile.  Oh, and if your water glass ever goes dry, then head for the hills because the sky is about to fall.  Beware that at dinner on the weekends will probably constitute a wait between 8-9pm (if not a little earlier).  Well worth it, though."}
{"text":"This is a review for take out at Lang Van Vietnamese. No way one can miss this restaurant driving by Shamrock Drive. Nice size parking lots.  Walked in to place a take out order after visiting the museum earlier. The menu for take out is the same as eating in the restaurant.   The pho soup base came out in a container and the broth was delicious. Soup was still piping hot when it got home.  The rare beef was laid out with noodles underneath in one container and another separate container with mint, basil and parsley with fresh bean sprouts on the side. Blended it all together in a soup bowl.   Crispy spring roll to go too and crunchy dipped in the sauce they provided for take out.  Will definitely be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Talk about a wonderful combination of different ingredients brought together for the most delicious Vietnamese food in Charlotte.  We visit Lang Van 3-4 times a year and yet the owner personally greats us and if she sees us coming in she orders our appetizer before we're even seated and it's always incredible.     The food is inviting and artfully served.  The service is outstanding and never disappoints.    The only negative is the location which is the ONLY reason we don't get there more often.  Had dinner there last night and still thinking how wonderful it was."}
{"text":"Pros: Excellent Pho Excellent pancakes Very good Spring (not the fried kind) roll Service Menu selection  Con: Not very attractive outside  We were looking for a place to eat as we passed through Charlotte and read the reviews of this place and were in the mood of Vietnamese food.  This place is a bit out of the way and does not look very impressive from the outside, but we were impressed with what they serve.  The service is very attentive and efficient.  The first wow is the selection on the menu.  It took a while just to read through them and the selection is overwhelming.  Many of the items we've not seen before.  The Pho (I had the first item in the Pho section) is very good.  The broth is excellent and it didn't leave that MSG aftertaste so I know it was the real good stuff.  The pancake is crispy and tasty.  The spring roll (get the one that is cold and wrapped in rice cake skin, not the fried one) was pretty good.    The price was reasonable. A very enjoyable meal.  I'm not Vietnamese, but I've had my share of Vietnamese food, especially Pho.  This was one of the best.  I can't vouch for authenticity, but regardless, I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We loved the ambience, we love the staff, they LOVE our kids.  The banh xeo are so crispy and fast, they rival my mom's (big compliment).  We didn't like the banh cuon so much, a little dry. The lemongrass curry chicken was great!  We always get the kids the com tam, but we're going to try to Branch out.  Cozy hole in the wall.  Great cookies with the bill."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I can't believe I didn't find it sooner!    The most noticeable thing is the service.  Literally if you take one sip of your water there is an entire team of people walking around that will make sure your water glass never gets below completely full.  The food is quick and absolutely delicious.  I didn't try anything I didn't like.  And their menu goes on for days!  I had the coconut curry with tofu and I could literally eat it every day of the week.  Wow.  My fiancé got the lemongrass chicken and it was beautiful.  Vietnamese desserts are my absolute favorite and Lang Van did not disappoint!!  They brought out a handful of \"cookies\" with the check.  ~the end to a perfect meal~  We brought our own wine and I don't even think they charged us a corkage fee.  Overall - love love love.  Cannot wait to go back.  The noms are strong with this one."}
{"text":"Wow!  wow!   Got the recommendation to visit here from the good folks at Free Range Brewing and we were really impressed.  I did the Pho Tai and the Summer Rolls (with the awesome peanut sauce), and both were really delightful.  I added a good amount of the table spices and it only enriched the delicious broth. This place doesn't look like much but it's absolutely a hidden gem in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars because it stays open til 11pm. I've eaten a lot of Pho in many different cities. This place has a very friendly staff that are very responsive. My water was never empty and the place is clean.  The broth is on the sweet side. They use lemon, not lime and I like that they give extra parsley along with basil.  When they brought us our check we had a nice little surprise with a candy, biscuit, and fortune cookie. It was a very large portion of noodles!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING on the menu is phenomenal! This is the kind of place where you quickly become a regular. The family that runs the restaurant is super friendly and great with faces and names. Try the coffee with condensed milk...it's dreamy and the perfect way to end a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The portions are big and the Vietnamese food is great.    One thing to note though, they do charge you for extra rice.  So if you split meals you will want to get your own rice because you only get a small bowl-- so just make sure to ask how much it is (I dont remember).  Great food though!"}
{"text":"I been eating here for about 20 years, it was one of the first viet restaurants in Charlotte. Over the years the owners have started to cater to American customers and don't really care about serving traditional food any more. It just taste like it. I probably won't ever be back to eat here anymore. There are other options for viet food nowadays"}
{"text":"My parents and my husband and I decided to have dinner here the other night.  We all were very impressed from the moment we entered the restaurant.  The staff was very welcoming, the restaurant was very clean and we were seated right away.  We all ordered something different and all of us enjoyed our meals thoroughly.  The food came out very quickly. The cute dessert plate that was brought out at the end of the meal was a nice added touch.  We'll definitely be back.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the parking lot is quite small."}
{"text":"I mean c'mon, this place is such a GEM! You walk in and get hit with the sweet sweet smell of authentic Vietnamese food! The owner walks around and takes orders/greets everyone and she is so sweet. You can tell her what sort of items you'd like your dish to contain and she comes up with something spectacular. It's nice to be able to do that because there is like 150+ menu items. Can't wait to come back, it's a new favorite of ours!"}
{"text":"This was my first Vietnamese food experience years ago. Then the ownership changed. After a few disappointing meals I moved on Ben Thanh and was very pleased. Made the mistake of craving Ben Thanh on a Wednesday when they are closed. Decided to revisit Lang Van. Food was not horrible but the balance was off. The bright flavor or fresh ginger and clean mint that Ive grown accustom to w BT was missing. LV May just be a little too rustic and heavy handed for me."}
{"text":"Super authentic Vietnamese food! The staff was very welcoming and ready to help with suggestions. I had the spicy lemon grass curry shrimp and I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I think the food here is fine, but this place's reputation as the best Vietnamese in town could def. be contested.  This is the \"hot-spot\" place to get Vietnamese, and the food here is good, but there are plenty of other good places in town.  I really prefer Ben Thanh on Central because it's larger and there is never a wait."}
{"text":"After trying several different Vietnamese restaurants around the Pineville, Matthews and Ballantyne areas (mostly looking for good Phò),  this place has definitely perfected this brothy-noodle dish. Completely worth the trip to East Charlotte. This little hole-in-the-wall restaurant doesn't feel \"corporate\", but you definitely taste and feel as though this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been dining here for YEARS. The thing I love is the food and service has been consistent. Never had a bad meal or experience. Excellent wait staff, heavenly fresh food at resealable prices. I wish I could give them more stars! As for recommendations, anything! And I look forward to their holiday decorations all year!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Lang Van. In fact, every time I go, I'm amazed by the authenticity of the food and the quality of the service. The owner will remember you after one visit so be prepared to have her greet you at the door. The entire staff is extremely friendly and attentive. The lemongrass tofu is my favorite meal but I usually let the owner suggest a meal, which never fails.   Don't let the exterior or location scare you off. It's definitely not pretty inside or outside, but it's very clean. If you love authentic Vietnamese, it's worth sacrificing ambiance."}
{"text":"Big selection of Vietnamese foods!  Taste pretty authentic to me. Pretty crowded on a Saturday evening, so apparently many others agree with me. The area is not in the high end district but their parking lot is entirely fenced off, and it has plentiful parking behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Lemongrass Curry with Beef (or Chicken) is my Favorite Dish here (as good as Ben Thanh)!  This is a light Stir-fried Dish with Fantastic Flavor and one of only two that I have eaten that are this FINE and SUPERB!  Can be made kind of Mild!  Jasmine Tea here is Fantastic!  Vietnamese Iced Coffee finishes brewing at you table on to Sweetened Condensed Milk as you would expect in a Vietnamese restaurant!  The Fresh Rolls are Excellent and the \"Peanut\" Sauce is Hoison Sauce with a little bit of Copped peanuts, like most Vietnamese Restaurants!  You can get a Sweet and Sour \"Fish\" Sauce if you do not care for the so called \"peanut\" sauce!  The Service is ATTENTIVE! !!  If service is going to be extreme I would prefer too much over too little!  To me the Service is Excellent here!   If I'm Craving Lemongrass Curry with Beef or Chicken on a Wednesday or when my main squeeze for most Vietnamese food is on Vacation 10 days every July, I'm heading to Lang Van!  Remember Lemongrass Curry is a \"Gateway\" Curry so Watch it!  EAT it and see what happens!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. The service is top notch. My water glass is never less than half full. Food comes out quick and always good. The only bad thing about the place is that it isn't open 24/7."}
{"text":"The food here tasted great, we had the fried spring rolls & Nem Nuong #1 & #3 on the menu they were both good but the Nem Nuong was a little dry. My bf had Pho Dac Biet with tripe added and I had Hu Tieu Hai San, both of us fully enjoyed the broth but the amount of meat/seafood was a bit lacking. Also if you have a small child it should be noted that there is no changing table in the bathroom. And no free refills of soda. Next  time we will just go to Pho real where we get super full and can have more than one glass of soda."}
{"text":"Love the new spot!  #26 Pho n #45 close to home, so pleasant welcoming and inviting they remember every face . What a great place!"}
{"text":"Get the green beans with tofu.  Even if you are not a vegetarian (I'm not) this dish will truly delight.  The hot pots are also very delicious.  I have never gone wrong with anything anything I ordered here.  This restaurant would do well in San Francisco, so for it to be in Charlotte is a real treat."}
{"text":"There is awesome Vietnamese food in southern California.  However, we aren't in California anymore, and North Carolina isn't exactly known for its Vietnamese cuisine.  Lang Van, however, is easily on par with the best Vietnamese food I've had anywhere.  This place seems unassuming and maybe a little run down on the outside.  There's a big parking lot in the back, which isn't immediately obvious.  Inside, though, it's nicely maintained.  We had the temple rolls (fried tofu spring rolls) which came with a savory peanut sauce.  I've had many peanut sauces that were sweet and peanuttier, but this one had more soy sauce in it, and maybe some wine.  We ate every drop of it.  The rolls themselves were also excellent.  The tofu was perfect, and they were also filled with vermicelli, bean sprouts, and mint.    I had the fresh rice noodles (#72, I think).  This reminded me somewhat of Thai drunken noodles: wide, flat noodles, stir-fried with veggies and fried tofu in garlic sauce.  Mine came with broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, snow peas, bean sprouts, and onions.  My husband had the special fried rice, and it was no problem for him to get it without shrimp.  While we both loved our meals, the menu is so big that I'll be tempted to try something else next time.  Instead of the usual fortune cookie, here you get what I like to think of as a mini dessert buffet: peanut cookies, fortune cookies, little tamarind candies.  Prices are a little high, but worth it for the quality of the food and service.  If it weren't for the fact that we live over two hours away, we'd probably have already gone back here."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars. Now we only ate here once, the food was really good and the service was great. We discussed our experience after the meal and honestly we have been more impressed with Doan and Ben Thanh so no I would NOT rate Lang Van the best hands down yada yada.  But this was only one single meal and the cooking was certainly tasty enough to be in the ballpark (if not in the lead). I wouldn't lose sleep over which one is \"the best\" in this case.  If you like Vietnamese then you'll enjoy dining at any of those three restaurants, we do."}
{"text":"I typically always get Pho at a Vietnamese restaurant... noodle soup is my favorite.  However the pictures on Yelp got me drooling for pineapple fried rice, curry, and sautéed noodles.  With so many delicious options, I wasn't sure what I wanted.  I told the waitress I liked spicy.  She asked if I liked chicken and shrimp, and whether I liked rice or noodle.  With that info, she said OK I got you.  I'm not used to letting someone decide my entree but I was feeling adventurous and was pleasantly surprised with what I got... chicken and shrimp lemongrass curry.  I could have taken more heat, but it was good.  I also had a tasting of the chicken curry and the flavors were amazing.   Great flavors, delicious food, and good service."}
{"text":"Decided to take my date here on a Friday night after seeing the number of 5 star reviews on Yelp. Let me say that this place did not disappoint. As soon as I walked in, a line had formed that almost reached the door. The attentive and highly efficient wait-staff had us seated in 8 minutes, which was shorter than I had thought.   Now, about the food. We started off with the shrimp and tofu summer rolls. The taste was fresh and paired well with the sweet peanut sauce on the side. I ordered the Bun (noodle dish with grilled shrimp, barbecue pork, spring roll, and shredded lettuce, carrots, and a vinegar/fish sauce). I added a little sriracha for a little kick. The dish was light, yet very flavorful (almost like eating a salad). The bbq pork was very tasty on its own. My date ordered the pho, which was ok (according to her).   Overall, great value for the food as the portion sizes were fairly large. Just a suggestion though, make a reservation before hand as this place can get quite busy..."}
{"text":"We had the Fresh Summer Roll, Banh Xeo, Hu Tieu Xao Kho Thap Cam,  Bun Tom Nuong.  We loved that every thing was so fresh and all the food had lots of flavor and depth.  We picked a good range of food and were not disappointed by any of it.  We have loved the yellow pancake when we have eaten at other Vietnamese paces around the country and it did not disappoint.   The service here is top notch .... they are very attentive and are a great help with navigating the menu and providing you with some suggestions.   We have tried a lot of different restaurants in and around Charlotte and have typically been disappointed.  We were not disappointment by Lang Van ... it is one of our favorites and we will be returning ... soon."}
{"text":"I'm not very adventurous when it comes to food, so, I had chicken/vegetables IN a pineapple.....it ruled so hard."}
{"text":"Only went here once, years ago. Everything is mediocre. For yummi Vietnamese, chech out Pho Real and/or Ben Thanh!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The owner is very kind.  Wish they were in south charlotte :).  IMO, they have the best pho"}
{"text":"Very good, I don't think it's the best i've had but it's really good.  I really like the do it yourself fresh rolls.  The pho is okay, maybe it's the broth, but the ingredients are fresh as can be."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've had in CLT.  The fried spring rolls were pretty great as well.  Don't let the area of town deter you from going here.  Super clean place and the service was fantastic. They even gave us a jar of the peanut cookies as a thank you/Xmas gift.  I will return soon!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my fiancé and future mother in-law. I believe it is a family owned business, but not 100% sure. Nonetheless, all the employees are so welcoming! It was not slammed busy when we arrived (maybe because we got there after the lunch rush), and was sat immediately. Within seconds (maybe a minute) we had water poured into our glasses and asked if we would like any other beverage as well - they have beer, wine, and soft drinks. After a few minutes, the server came by and asked if we would like an appetizer. We ordered the summer rolls. They were delicious! So fresh, and the sauce (peanut sauce) was yummy! We were talking a lot so it took us a while to order... my fiancé and I ordered pho and she ended up ordering #108, which is a shrimp stir-fry with steamed rice. The pho is pretty amazing. The broth is flavorful but not overpowering. All the herbs are fresh. The noodles seemed like they were portioned out before hand because it was like a clump at the bottom of the bowl, but with a little twist or two they separated quite easily. The shrimp stir-fry looked delicious as well! I was too focused on my pho to even ask for a small taste of hers. Our glasses of water never went below half a glass and we were checked on numerous times. Once a person was done eating, their plates would not sit on the table more than a couple of minutes before an employee asked if they could take it for us. Their food is amazing and it is very family oriented. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The coffee is amazing!! The shrimp spring rolls in rice paper are out of this world with their peanut sauce!!"}
{"text":"Love love love Lang Van! The staff is so welcoming and attentive to all your needs! Each time I go I typically get the tofu summer rolls served with a peanut sauce for an appetizer. They are delicious and so fresh! For an entree I usually get stir fry vegetables with chicken and thick rice noodles (not exactly sure what it's called), but it is so yummy! Love everything they have to offer, so many options! Hands down one of my favorite places to go for dinner! They typically get pretty busy so I go around 5:30-6 and beat the rush! Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This place has been here for as long as I can remember. I can't believe that I'm just now getting around to trying out this place. This place was packed and I was quickly seated the server was very friendly and helpful with explaining any questions I had about the menu. I had the Lemon Grass Tofu which was delicious! I also requested that the food be made spicy and I was not disappointed. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Last night, I had a terrific experience with a take out order. I ordered without using menu numbers, and I asked for a Com Tam Bi that was not on their menu and she made one for me. Outstanding! The spring rolls were as good as ever. The Goi Ga should have had more chicken, though. The tofu with vermicelli was ordered \"very spicy\" and came that way -- great job! This update puts them back on top."}
{"text":"All I can say is OUTSTANDING. The food and service was excellent and the menu choices were great. I wish I lived closer so I could dine there more often."}
{"text":"How is it possible that, with my obsession with Vietnamese food, I did not know about this gem hidden less than 2 miles from my house?! Thank you, Yelp, for righting this wrong.   We went to this place on a random Sunday afternoon when our meal timing was off so we were totally starving, and we were not disappointed.   From the second we walked in, we knew we were in a good place. The restaurant smelled amazing and it was very nicely lit (lots of sunshine) and we were immediately approached by a smiling woman who seated us in a comfy booth.  We had the jicama rolls and the summer rolls as starters (both delicious) and I had a mix of beef, chicken and shrimp stir fried with vegetables and rice virmicelli. It was delicious and I topped it with some of their chili sauce to add a little extra heat. (The dish was delicious and flavorful by itself, but I felt like making it spicy anyway.) :)  I can't wait to go back to explore more on their menu. On the to do list to try are definitely some of the curry dishes, the hot pot, and the pho (to name a few!)   Just writing this made me hungry for their food again..."}
{"text":"Went in and was a little overwhelmed with the huge menu. When we asked our waitress for suggestions she asked us what we liked, after we all described what we were looking for she said \"ok\" and left to put our orders in. Within minutes we all had huge dishes of exactly what we each were looking for. Great service, great food - we'll be back! This place is almost dangerous it's so good!"}
{"text":"Food is quite yummy and authentic! Not the best ambiance or location. And I am personally not a fan of the waitstaff. Mostly because most of them speak minimal english, so in my experience when I've asked for something, the answer tends to just be no. *blank stare* Sometimes, I think its just the word they know. Buuut, besides that, the food is great. You will definitely get authentic foodie experience. Good place to try....it can be quite addictive too! lol"}
{"text":"I have been here several times with my mom. However my mom has been coming here for several years and the owner always remembers her and treats us so well! The menu is overwhelming at first. If you aren't sure of what to pick, the owner will most definitely help you pick out something. Most likely she will just say she has something for you -- and it will be delicious.   We started out with spring rolls. The tofu was still hot and the peanut sauce is delicious. For my meal, I had the lemon grass curry chicken medium heat. The spice level was perfect, the chicken was super moist and tender. It's served over lettuce, which is different but I enjoyed it because it seemed lighter and allowed me to eat my entire plate! My sister got the tofu hot pot and liked it. My mom got the country soup (which apparently she always gets and didn't even have to order).  When we got our check, we were treated with an array of delicious desserts. On top of that, they sent us home with a bottle of wine and a jar of the peanut cookies!! So sweet and thoughtful. We love this restaurant, can't wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"Lang Van's food is great. I agree with Joy S. -- the service is almost too prompt. I went to Lang Van to catch up with old friends I hadn't seen in a while. But our order was taken and our food came out so quickly, we probably ended up being there less than 45 minutes. I probably shouldn't complain though. It's better than slow service."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Saw it on my way back to Raleigh. There was a wait of around 20 min but it was worth it. The food here is awesome. I had fresh tofu roll as starter, vegetable hot pot and garlic tofu with glass noodles. It was delicious. Will surely go again on my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"When I was a student at UNCC we used to come here for a great meal over 15 years ago.  We went back last weekend with my wife and kids to share the experience and everything is thankfully still the same!  Do not let the appearance of the exterior deter you.  The food is incredible and am looking for an excuse to visit Charlotte again so I can get my Lang Van Vietnamese 'fix' again!"}
{"text":"Asked for pho dac biet but they left out the tendon and tripe. Make sure they don't leave it out for you."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restaurant has: awesome foods, great atmostphere, friendly staff, Lang Van is your best choice."}
{"text":"Great flavor!!! Line was long with regulars. Love that the servers call everyone 'honey.'"}
{"text":"All I have to say is YUM!  Love it!  Had never had Vietnamese food till I went here; I will return & often!"}
{"text":"The menu is huge but the waitress did a good job of identifying the most popular selections.  Wife got #45 (bun) and I got #103.  I thought there should have been more shrimp, meats, etc.  The flavor was good on both meals.  Place was very clean.  Service was unmatched.  I actually liked the Vietnamese beer.  We had the quail appetizer and it was great.  Would recommend this place if you crave Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior or surroundings fool you: this place is AMAZING! Not only is the food authentic, delicious and unique, but the service is excellent. During my first visit I barely knew what half of the menu was. Our server patiently explained dishes to me, helped me navigate my way towards vegetarian-friendly menu items, and regularly checked on us to make sure we were enjoying our food. Do not hesitate to ask for help or advice with the menu. They are wonderfully understanding and patient!  The \"House Special Hot Pot\" is a great veggie dish, as is the \"Sweet Potato Curry\". For an awesome veggie appetizer, try the \"Summer Rolls\" with  peanut sauce. So good!  If you are thinking about eating here, DO IT! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"After talking about it for a looonng time a friend of mine finally got me over to try Lang Van and am I glad he did. As soon as we walked in the door he was greeted like an old friend. As he has been a \"regular\" here for about 5 years. We were seated immediately and she asked if he wanted the regular, he nodded and before I knew it we had some spring rolls, some summer rolls, and a pitcher of iced tea. After scanning the enormous menu, I decided on basic rare beef pho #27. It was incredible! Food was all so fresh, the pho broth was perfect, my water glass never dipped below 3/4 full.  I can't wait to get back and try more!"}
{"text":"summer rolls great, rare pho beef not sliced thin so thats the only problem i have, broth is good, a little oily"}
{"text":"Lang Van's WAS my fav place for 17 years.     The manager WILL let you know if you have overstayed your welcome; she literally asked my parents (from out of town) and I to leave when a line formed.  We were NOT finished.   Otherwise, the service is consistently very good, the food is of high quality and there is plenty of parking. I have never had a mediocre meal but hate feeling like I'm rushed and watched by the manager if they get busy."}
{"text":"I'd heard nothing but rave reviews of Lang Van, but I never been to check it out until this past Friday. My first impression of the restaurant is that it looks a little sketchy on the outside...kind of like a converted garage...and the parking lot is a big, concrete jungle. When you get through the doors, though, it gets much better inside. It's actually pleasant in a minimalist kind of way. The large windows that give it the garage-effect outside make it bright and pretty inside.   One of my favorite things about Vietnamese, Thai, and other islandy cuisines are the exotic drinks, and I'm not just talking about alcohol. I'm always a fan of bubble tea, fresh juices, milk teas, and anything else. I wanted to check out the menu at Lang Van a bit to see what they had, but the staff was a little over-eager to take my order. \"Can I help you? Are you ready?\" again and again, until finally I gave up trying to read. I ordered the fresh squeezed lemon juice, which is a kind of sweet and tangy lemonade. It reminded me a little of the lemonade you can get at Chic-Fil-A...good stuff.  I ordered the vermicelli with curry, and it absolutely lived up to my expectations. It juxtaposed spicy with sweet in the perfect way, and I ate it all. The tofu was crispy and spicy and lemon-grassy and awesome.  Another great part of Lang Van is the little peanut-butter cookie they bring out with the bill, and a little Vietnamese candy. I like freebies, and these were much more interesting than a fortune cookie or a mint.  Overall, the food was great, the service was (possibly a little too) prompt, and the environment was bright and nice. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot for pho.  The flavor of the broth was amazing.  The meatballs were good as well, nice and firm.  The portion size was perfect for when I was super hungry.  The customer service though was the best part.  Everyone on the staff did something for us in one way or another: clearing dishes, greet us, serve us, refill water...I think we had at least 6 different employees come to our table.  They are so fast and still very nice.  I would definitely come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Great, authentic eats with friendly but over eager service. I will definitely return because the menu is VERY extensive and the flavor of both dishes at our table was outstanding. Being used to authentic ethnic food on every corner in NYC, I was impressed to find something in Lang Van to rival home.  It would be nice, though, if the interior was a bit better than \"classy diner\" and if the waiters didn't refill my water glass every time I took a sip."}
{"text":"Maybe I went on a bad day or I'm being overly critical, but the service was horrible. The pho was also horrible.   Pho is pho. The noodles, meat and vegetables are the same everywhere you go. The only way you tell if the pho is good is through the broth. The pho here was translucent and tasteless even with all the MSG they put in there to mask their laziness.   But yeah, sure. If you're an elderly white couple, then they will scream hello and thank you. I guess that means good service."}
{"text":"Lang Van is a jewel. The staff is terrific and make you feel at home. I usually order spring rolls for an appetizer and #104 for an entree. The entree is an amalgam of chicken, shrimp, veggies, and noodles doused, by me, with a healthy squirt of Sriracha sauce. Sure, the outside looks run-down and the inside is kitschy, but you don't go there for the decor, you go for the delicious food."}
{"text":"This is a favorite of mine - I go here at least once a month.  Don't get intimidated by the huge menu - if you are at a loss just ask the waiter - 'do you have something like....' and say what you like and chances are you will get it and love it.  The make your own shrimp wraps here are a must.  I always get the seafood soup, they bring with it a platter of greens so you can put in everything to taste (including a whole bowl of sliced jalepeno!)  I am not sure what the seafood soup is called on the menu - i just describe it and they bring it out.  Fantastic spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service every time! I love the vegetarian options like the create your own spring rolls, hot pot, and rice noodle dishes. The staff memorize your favorites after only a couple of visits and can provide recommendations if you don't want to read the lengthy list of options."}
{"text":"Wonderful Vietnamese food and fantastic service. On a rainy day in Charlotte nothing could be better than a bowl of hot noodles.  I had the seafood broth that had a complex taste and was excellent seasoned. The spring rolls were a nice addition"}
{"text":"Don't tell anyone but this is the best place in town. I eat Pho on the regular. This place is near my house so I will never move. Ever. Pho to go - Stop. It makes the world better. Nicest people on the planet work here too! I have tried other things on the menu and they were super dope... that Pho tho.... If I could marry a dish it would be this dish. From Lang Van. There should be an extra meal time in the day for Pho. And this is where you should get it. But keep it a secret - we don't want everyone to know."}
{"text":"Extensive menu options with good descriptions. Pho tau was a good portion and the cha gio was crunchy as it should. Came in for lunch and hits your pho/Vietnamese craving and service was quick and owners are friendly. Check it out."}
{"text":"I have hit a lot of the Vietnamese places in town and vote this one the very best.  I had a big bowl of PHO with chicken and vegetables and all the fru fru greens to go on top.  As always, it was delicious.   Lang Van is out there as far as the location. From South Charlotte, it took me almost an hour arrive there. . But, that was with traffic and lots of stop lights to get to its location near Eastway and Sharon Amity.  As the crow flies, it's not all that far.  It is well worth the drive.   Very clean and a quiet atmosphere. Perfect as a place for a meeting of the minds!  I have been coming here for years, but sometimes forget about it due to its location.  Every time I eat their food, I am reminded what a fabulous place it is.  If you haven't been, GO!  If you have been, GO BACK!  It is consistently superb.   Five Stars all the way around."}
{"text":"All hail the yellow pancake! For you are filled with shrimp, pork and bean sprouts! As Tonya instructed, I will fill you with cilantro, basil and homemade hot sauce!!! I will then spend the next 15 minutes moaning out loud and making other diners feel extremely uncomfortable or highly intrigued as I consume you in a gluttonous onslaught!!  The staff is a well-oiled smiling machine! The food is incredible! Garlic tofu is king!  All hail the yellow pancake! That is all. Carry on!!"}
{"text":"Good authentic food is hard to find in Charlotte. What I have found is that if its really good and authentic, not many people want to \"talk about it\". Why, because when the \"secret\" is out, the restaurant will get so busy, they will have a hard time getting a place at the table. Lang Van stands true to this theory and I completely understand why. The owner who literally greets every table at one point or another, is so warm and welcoming. I wasn't sure what to order other than the delicious Fresh Summer Rolls (highly recommend), she ordered for me. What was it, I have no idea but it too was delicious. The dish had chicken, broccoli, carrots and it was in a delicious sauce. She told me to have some of the peanut sauce on the side in case I wanted it. I had about three different people come to my table to either ask me if I was ok, if I needed anything or to put more water in my glass. Service was FAST but I never felt rushed, just attended to. I can't wait to go back but this time, order on my own."}
{"text":"You cannot drink your water fast enough without a smiling wait person re-filling the glass the minute it hits the tablecloth. The service is unbeatable here. Vietnamese food is not my thing, but the presentation was outstanding and if you are into this sort of thing, you cannot do better. Everyone in my group of five is vegan, so I went along and had some sort of noodles with tofu and broccoli. The other four raved and their food looked great as well. I would go back. They sure make you feel welcome here"}
{"text":"This would be five stars, but the fresh spring rolls were underwhelming. Amazing pan fried noodles"}
{"text":"Absolutely absolutely incredible dining experience here. You are treated just as if you are family. Frequent customers are remembered and don't even need to place an order, the Lang Van staff already know what you want. The food is incredible, the staff and personal table services are far beyond excellent, what else can I say?, this place is a hidden gem. From appetizer to dessert, this restaurant's cuisine and dining experience is one that I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Such a great experience! Everyone is so nice and welcoming. My husband and I LOVED the food... very reasonably priced too. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Lang Van, I was scared of you but now I want you more than ever!  Thank God I'm dating a genuine foodie and she's introduced me to you.  I can promise you that this affair is far from over and I will back to visit you VERY soon!  Some of the freshest ingredients in Charlotte I've ever had and the most interesting combination of food, yet palette pleasing all the same.  Super friendly service slaps you in the face from the moment you walk in to the minute you're walking back out the door."}
{"text":"Oh Lang Van, you disappoint me.  I've been coming to Lang Van pretty faithfully for the last six years, and the food is gradually getting blander and blander.  I tend to go for their vermicelli noodle bowls, because recent experiences with the pho have been kind of mild and watery.  And this last time, the noodles were overly wet, the sauce was sweet and not very complex, and the veggies were a little limp.  If I had to pick a favorite Vietnamese place now it would not be this one.  The ridiculously aggressive service (really?  we just sat down, can we have a minute?  and you do not need to fill a water glass every time the customer takes a sip!) does not help with the experience.  The new parking lot, however, is swanky."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my favorite hidden hole-in-the-wall in Charlotte.  The problem is, it's not that big a secret anymore.  Pull up any evening and see the yuppie smattering of BMWs and SUVs lining the parking spaces at the front of this little unassuming building that houses such a number of tasty eats.  Add to that it's at the intersection of Eastway and Shamrock and the contrast is only that much more apparent.  That's right true Charlotteans- Eastway and Shamrock!  Double-check your locks before you head inside for some true Vietnamese delights.  As any regular knows, the place is actually run by a head female server who knows her customers to a fault and greets you with hugs and an almost scary photographic memory of what you like to eat and drink.  The top steak houses in the city can keep track of my visits all they want, but they still can't recite and confirm my order for me before I've even slid into one of the booths to prepare for the meal to come.  I kinda of like that, even if it locks me in before I've perused the menu.  Luckily, I've carved out a trio of favorites that the head server runs thru before we send the order back to the kitchen.    Highlights include summer rolls- tender rice paper wraps fresh shrimp mixed with greens, bean sprouts and mint leaves.  The star here, though, is really the peanut dipping sauce.  I unabashedly lick the little blow clean and have yet to find the equivalent anywhere else.  It adds the perfect mix of tang and savory to contrast with the fresh earthiness of the greens and mint leaves in the roll.  I could make a whole meal out of these.  For mains, I'm a big time fan of the lemongrass curries.  Be it chicken or tofu, the flavor here rules- delicate lemongrass with the base heat and pungency of curry.  The balance is near-perfect and I find myself using the side dish of rice to soak up every bit of the sauce.  The fresh cilantro on top is like icing on this cake.  I even love that you have the pull the herb's leaves off to mix in yourself- you control the strength of that element.  On colder nights, I also advocate the clay pot house special.  It's a mix of meats served with vegetables and a rice cooked in a savory tomato base all melding together in a very hot clay pot.  It warms me up and is one of those \"stick to your ribs\" dishes that leaves me full.  Meals are always finished off with a check and a couple mini peanut butter cookies, thicker than they are wider.  Nice and cakey, without being overly sweet.  You also get a tamarind hard candy, wrapped and perfect to open later.  On the weekends you also get the most wonderful sesame bun with a sweet bean curd filling.  I would threaten to cut my dining companions if they shut me out on this last piece, it is served hot and I could eat dozen if they'd let me.  In short, you get a get a mix of fresh herbs and savory sauces that are really perfect together.  The menu is many, many pages long, but do not fear- just tell the server what you like and trust in her.    Yes, the prices here are a notch above what you might expect, but I have found portion sizes to be generous and the wife and I get by usually sharing a single entree, especially after each having a couple of summer rolls.  The service, though, is especially efficient and expedient, even a single sip of water tends to generate a refill within seconds.  I can deal with that.  If you drink iced tea, they bring you a whole mini pitcher just for yourself.  Beware- I find their tea is brewed really strong and the sweet tea- well, hope you like the sugar you true Southerner, you.  If I had one complaint here, it's the soundtrack that is on endless loop.  Jazzy elevator music classics that are cheesier than any dish you will find on the menu.  I swear every time I walk in I am \"treated\" to \"My heart will go on\" the Titanic theme song and the theme song from Bonanza- all in the mellow, jazz style that is meant to stay in the background but ends up being that gnat in your ear that just won't go away.  Still, I don't come hear to enjoy the tunes.  I come to enjoy the food, and that, my friends, is superbly executed here."}
{"text":"Service was great and it's a solid local spot. The Pho was good but not great...expected a little more from such an authentic place. But, I would give it another shot. Could have been an off day and everyone else really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I've had Vietnamese in DC and Los Angeles, and this was definitely the best I've experienced anywhere. The restaurant was recommended by New Yorkers who moved to Charlotte, and they claimed it was better than any they experienced in NYC. It was that good. Though the outside of the restaurant and the hoodlums running around the neighborhood are not too inviting, the inside of the restaurant and the furnishings were clean, attractive and comfortable. The presentation of the food is excellent. The service is outstanding -- friendly employees, attentive servers, and great recommendations. The wine list is not large, but it had sufficient options. The menu of entrees was extensive. I chose the Summer Rolls with peanut sauce, and they were refreshing and fresh. I am so happy that I chose the Vermicilli (#45) rather than the Pho -- the grilled meats and vegetables were delectable and fresh. I have no idea what the peanut butter cookies were that the server brought at the end of the meal, but they were the perfect and tasty ending to a perfect dinner. Kudos to this restaurant for being one of the nation's best Vietnamese restaurants right here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service.  Everyone is welcomed with a smile and treated as if they've known you for years.  Summer rolls are excellent and my go-to is the #43...sooooo good.  We try to go once a month and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Having arrived before they opened, I waited in my vehicle until opening time. It was hard to determine when they were ready for me, because they continued cleaning until 5 minutes after opening time. I finally went in when another customer pulled in and got out of his car.  On the positive side:  I decided to try the crispy quail, a new one for me. 4 little quail (quails?) fried to a crisp and dipped in a little container with pepper and lemon juice. Absolutely delightful. Very finger-foodish, so needed the napkin frequently.   Their service is attentive and quick. I did feel rushed, as other reviewers have mentioned. Good place for a fast business lunch, but not a place to contemplate one's existence in peaceful reverie, you know?  Daughter wanted noodle bowl (we got the mixed one--shrimp, pork, egg roll). The sauce complemented the plenteous noodles and salad, and the meat was tender and flavorful. The shrimp came on a skewer.  Thumbs up.  I wanted to give their pho another try, at least the broth, so I tried to order just a tiny bowl of broth--no meat, noodles, etc.  They brought a regular size bowl with pho broth AND noodles, and charged 5.95 for it.   Apparently  the reason I couldn't remember their pho for my last review is that it's not worth mentioning, in my opinion. The flavor is either non-existent or it's kind of like those high-pitched dog whistles that only dogs can hear. I couldn't hear it.   So, a mixed bag. Go for something besides the pho and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese not only in Charlotte, but all of the United States - bold claim, I know. But this place deserves it. I have never had a bad meal from this place and it's one of the only places that will allow you to customize your own meal every time. The first time I went, I had trouble with the menu so I told the woman serving us that I wanted something spicy with shrimp and noodles and she made me a custom dish that was out of this world. Turns out that the woman serving us was the owner and she remembers everything! So every time I visit now, she remembers me and what I like and don't like. I don't even have to look at the menu - I tell her what I'm craving, and she brings me back magic. I have never had a bad meal at Lang Van- it is always incredible. It makes my heart smile to see someone so dedicated to their business and their customers. The fact that the owner serves customers, busses tables, and takes the time to get to know people and what they like to such a rarity. Even if you don't like Vietnamese food, I bet if you gave this place a try, you'd love it!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we've eaten here at least, and thought I'd reviewed before but now I must! Every visit has been exceptional, from the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff to the delicious food! It doesn't look like much from the outside but you owe yourself to step in and feast. This visit I recall we had numbers 44, 45 and I believe either 103 or 104, sorry but my lack of Vietnamese language skills does not permit my recall of the actual names. But I'd wager you can pick at random and get something truly tasty. As I mentioned, our waitress was also helpful at helping us choose based on what we were interested in. The pricing is good too, so dive in!"}
{"text":"Last September I was weary from driving 8 hours, I was so happy to find a pho restaurant with so many excellent reviews! I ordered pho tai, and it came precisely as I'd requested it. It was delicious, with a marvelous roasted bone broth. The basil and other garnishes were very fresh and delicious. I had not nearly finished my bowl, but had taken a moment to quietly savor the flavors and the warmth in my belly, when the hovering began.   At that time, there was apparently no coordination of bus service, water-glass refilling, etc.  I hope they've resolved this by now, because being asked five times in 10 minutes \"are you finished?\" \"Can I take your bowl?\" \"May I clear that?\" etc., etc., really detracted from my otherwise lovely experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is Vietnamese so I have been to a lot of different Vietnamese restaurants. food was okay, it wasn't that authentic but it still tasted fine. I got the seafood soup. The waiters were extremely nice!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great experience. The staff is very attentive and the food was amazing!!!!  I went with a group of friends and they treated us like royalty\". The waitress was excellent with her suggestions of what to have and the chefs prepared us a great dish with an explosion of favors!  I found my new favorite place!!!  Go with a great group of friends and expect a great vibe and even better dinner!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for years, I finally made it around to visiting, and I can't say I was disappointed.  It was quite tasty.  I had the tarragon pancake and tofu dish.   It was seasoned well and the leafy side was a nice touch I wasn't expecting.  The mint, cilantro and lettuce wraps made it very healthy, guilt-free and satisfying.  I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place comes highly recommended and I see why. I was with a group of ladies for foodies and fellowship. The staff was great for a group of 8. The waitress was very helpful with the menu items. This a true Vietnamese resturant. I had the spring rolls and the traditional Bun Tom. It's what look for when want authentic Vietnamese. Very pleased."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. You never have to wait for anything and you can tell they appreciate your business. Food is always good and lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"If you're not looking for Lang Van, I can't imagine why you'd be in this neighborhood... It's worth venturing off the beaten path to get there though! I love their iced coffee and swear I can feel the sugar and caffeine literally coursing through my veins as I drink the sweet, thick, ice-cold concoction.   The menu is super overwhelming and I often have a hard time deciding. (That is, when my heart isn't set on #19, of course.) If you can't decide, just ask the owner... I've told her so many times, \"I love fresh veggies and am in the mood for something spicy with lots of herbs, maybe some chicken...\" She'll listen for a second or two, grin and exclaim, \"I fix good for you!\" I've even been before and ordered something only to be told, \"No. You don't want that. You want #XYZ instead.\" Without fail, she's ALWAYS right. I don't know how she does it, but her recommendation is always exactly what I'm craving and hits the spot every time.   Lang Van's food is fresh and flavorful! Trust me... set your GPS to take you to Shamrock Road, ask the nice lady the seats you for her recommendation and get ready to enjoy! Oh, and don't forget that iced coffee."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant since moving to the Lake Norman area from Washington, DC. This is a bit of a drive, but absolutely worth it. The food was fresh and delicious. The customer service was outstanding. We can not wait to go back and try more items from the menu!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Vietnamese place in Charlotte. Good food, nice ambience and very active staff. Their soups are amazing and a must try !!"}
{"text":"I love the homey feel here. The pho here is pretty good. Servers are super polite and friendly!"}
{"text":"This is scream a whole in a wall full of goodness. I am so happy that I had the opportunity to dine here. The staff is sooooo kind. They remember me from my last visit with my sister. This was my first time eating Vietnamese food and it wont be my last. I ordered the pho which was super tasty with beef. and I also order the curry chicken which was amazing it was sweet curry also with vitemanse coffee that they bring to you in a nice pour over with condensed milk making the iced coffee"}
{"text":"Had the summer rolls and pho tai here. The pho was good. The summer rolls were typical. A lot of restaurants cut the shrimp in half to make it look like you're getting a lot of shrimp, but you're really getting a lot of noodles. I'm used to making it with a lot of shrimp, beef, herbs, and veggies.The first time I came here the restaurant was closed for a week because it is family owned and everyone was on vacation. The second time I came here, there were a ton of flies flying around which made for an interesting experience. The server was very attentive and kept our glasses full even if we took one small sip."}
{"text":"Had the summer and spring rolls, roasted quail, yellow pancake, dry vermicelli noodle, pho dac biet, the wide noodle, yellow coconut curry, and fried tofu. By far some of the freshest and best Vietnamese food in the city! Very clean as well, which is something that can be hard to find in Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. The food was 1 appetizer # 2 summer rolls they were enjoyed . Then two dishes, Steamed veggies # 92 with shrimp which was fine. I ordered # 44 with shrimp extra spicy and to start it was not spicy American spicy let alone Asian spicy . It was not hard to find a black hair in my white rice , My hair is light brown to blonde so I know where it came from and I get it there is hair in life so I pulled it moved on. My shrimp was flavorful and as mentioned it was not spicy as a curry should be it was also over cooked. I also would use caution at the intersection near the business at 745-8pm the setting sun is right in the traffic signal, brutal."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Lang Van and I can't believe I waited this long.  For the most part this was a wonderful experience.  It forced me out of my Vietnamese comfort zone and I broke away from the Pho for Vermicelli -  BUN GA NUONG to be exact.   The mixture of flavors in this dish gave my mouth an orgasm.  Mint mixed with chili pepper sauce.  I really wanted to order a 2nd dish to take home but this gives me reason to drive across town to come back.  The service was exceptional.  We never had to wait for drink refills.  Of course tea drinkers had their own pitchers on the table.  The food came out quick and was hot, very appetizing and very affordable for the portion you received.  The only bad thing was the booth we were seated in was a bit tight for 4 people and to me it was very uncomfortable.  But overall, this is another Charlotte gem!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant.  I'm not certain if it is because of the food (incredibly delicious) or because of the wait staff (very attentive)  The owner is hilarious. She has a great sense of humor. She always recognizes and hugs us (and everyone else who walks through the door)  She won't allow us to pick certain items (example: my husband has been wanting to try the duck and she refuses to let him order it- she prefers to order for us. We thought that there was no duck, but we now know that there is duck, she just doesn't want us to eat the duck. We have no idea why, but we just go along with whatever she says).   The summer roles are delicious.   We always end up staying longer than planned. We always end up with coffee and talking to the owner and our friends. They don't mind if you linger over your food. It is a relaxing atmosphere.  You will never have an empty glass of water. At the end of the dinner they give you yummy cookies."}
{"text":"Not just the best Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. The best restaurant in Charlotte. I have had much more expensive/fancy dining experiences in the city, but I've not had food so good or service that is even in the same ballpark.  The owner is simply amazing. She remembers everyone! She knows where we sat, what we ate and is a treasure. When we were overwhelmed by the menu or unsure about what to try, she has been ready to make something just for us to meet our tastes. And while she is a one of a kind lady, her staff are all good too, all very friendly and attentive.  I wish that I could try more of her menu, but I love the Bun so much that I might cry if I went here and didn't get it. Bun is so simple, and until I got it here at Lang Van I was mostly of the opinion that Bun is Bun. Some better than others, but the differences were minor. But at Lang Van it was incredible. Each of the meats was delicious on its own, and the crisp rolls are tasty as well.  The wife isn't as addicted to Bun as I am, so she tries more on the menu and is never disappointed. I get to try her dishes as well, so best of both worlds for me. We get the fresh summer rolls, as they are always great and my wife would probably divorced me in order to marry that peanut sauce if it were an option.  We finish everything off with the coffee and leave incredibly happy. You definitely should go here. Go here often. Stop reading reviews and go! Now!"}
{"text":"06/20/10  (Not so) fresh in Charlotte (we took the red-eye flight in), Mom and I were driven here by my sister and her son straight from the airport for some good Vietnamese fare.  She's been here before with coworkers, so she knew we'd enjoy the food (I turned her onto Thai green curry, and she knew Mom liked pho).  As we got out of the car, she said that this place was a hole-in-the-wall (the outside certainly screamed of it), but I'd already come across reviews from Charlotte yelpers, so I knew the food was, at the very least, decent.  I told her it wasn't me she should be apologizing to about the dive-y aspect of LV, but I digress...  Well!  Whatever LV lacks in looks outdoors, it certainly made up for indoors-- this place doesn't look like a dive at all!  It's actually pretty cozy indoors, with warm paint hues, wall accents, and floral decor.  Staff seemed friendly enough, with sincere smiles and perky greetings at the ready.  That is, up until I started taking photos* of my durian shake.  Duri-what, you say?  But I'm getting ahead of myself...  We started off with glasses of water all around and a durian shake.  Well, first I asked what our server would recommend- the soursop or the durian shake?  She said she liked the flavor and consistency of the durian, but that I should really go for the avocado.  Now, we're from the Philippines, so we all know about soursop, durian, and avocado, so I get what she was trying to tell me.  Unfortunately, I have an avocado allergy, so that's a no-go.  (Why, oh why can't I be allergic to a food I hate??)  So, I went w/ the stinky durian.  If you've ever come across durian, you know it's not a scent you'd readily reach a bottle of and spray on yourself willingly (you might as well reach for a skunk), but many food addicts will agree with me, it makes for a mighty tasty and creamy beverage!  OMG, how I wanted to order another one, and I wasn't even finished with the first!  Our mom agreed with me; my sister didn't.  Sadly, bec. her son heard of his mom's aversion, he wasn't willing to give it a go.  Oh, well.  More for us!  Our server came back and took the rest of our order: fresh summer rolls app (goi cuon) for Mom and sis; eggrolls (chia gio) and a chicken skewer on vermicelli for the little one; a stir-fried shrimp with steamed veggies for Mom; a chicken curry with stewed sweet potato chunks for sis; and beef lemongrass curry for me.  All rolls came wrapped with rice paper; non-noodle dishes came with rice, with the exception of my selection, which came over shredded lettuce, sauteed onions, crisp alfalfa sprouts, and chopped parsley.    Nephew loved the eggrolls!  So much so, he didn't even touch his chicken skewer and noodles.  Mom and sis enjoyed the shrimp dish, but eschewed the chicken and sweet potato curry, stating that the chicken \"fingers\" were dry and flavorless.  (Indeed, they looked like pieces that normally are subject to the blanch and shock methods of cooking to be later used in stir-fried and curry-fried dishes.)  Mom, sis, and I agreed, however, that the stewed sweet potato chunks were delicious; the one-note sweet flavor in this curry dish came from the sweet potato.  I think the dish would've been better served with beef...  It was unanimous- the best dish in the entire meal was the beef lemongrass curry!  I was tempted to order medium-spice, but I wanted Mom to enjoy it, as well, so I chose mild, and were we all glad that I did!  Perfectly spiced (apparently, Viet-mild is hotter than Thai-mild), the beef was very flavorful, salted just so, and was oh-so-tender that it almost melted in your mouth, yet had enough of a chew to it that you knew you were having stir-fried meat.  Y'know what I'm sayin'?  Oh, forget what I'm trying to say and just order a plate and taste what I mean for yourself!      With such a spread, we didn't order any desserts- the shake was decadent enough.  However, the bill arrived with a few of those tamarind-flavored candy, as well as these ab-fab mini peanut-cookie morsels!  I am now on a quest to hunt a bag (or two, or three!) of these to take back home!  No, they're not made in-house, so perhaps someone can tell me where I can find some?  *Try to keep the photos to a minimum.  All of the smiles from other servers disappeared once I started taking photos of the shake, and later, the food.  Our server kept up with the smiles, though."}
{"text":"Perfect! I got tofu curry with extra vegetables. The vegetables were so fresh and cooked perfectly. I don't normally like tofu, but it was fried nicely and added to the dish. I got rice, which was great to soak in the curry sauce. I wanted French bread too, but they said they didn't have any.   My son got pho dac viet and loved the flavor of the broth. He said it was on par with his best friend's mother's homemade pho, which according to him is the best in the world, so there you go. :)  We got the fried spring roll appetizer and they were really good. The thin, tightly rolled egg rolls are the best. They even had dried mushrooms in them which added to the flavor. Very yummy."}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese food! Seems very healthy too.  They have great spring rolls that you can either order pre-made or make them yourself.  They are very keen on refilling your water too."}
{"text":"The priority for this restaurant is yummy food. The building and decor is lacking but who cares. It's a perfect dive with satisfying meals. Everything I have eaten has been fabulous and fresh.   Suggestions: Vietnamese coffee, spring rolls, lemon grass curry beef (a little kick), lemon grass curry chicken (a little kick) and beef pho. Fragrant! Absolutely belly filling and delicious."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Vietnamese restaurant, friendly staff and quick service. They have the best Vegetarian spring  rolls in town, loaded with lemongrass."}
{"text":"Not sure what you can say about Lang Van that hasn't already been said!  I've been here a few times with good company and always enjoyed it.    The staff is very eager to please, sometimes a little too eager...haha :).  As others have stated, the menu is huge but I've never gotten anything that wasn't pretty tasty.  The wraps appetizers are great, also the curry with the sweet potatoes in it is awesome.  I've also tried the hot pot where you cook your own meat (steak, chicken, shrimp, calamari) and veggies in the broth...very good and fun to share!  They have also recently worked on the parking lot and there's a lot of parking around back now.  Great little spot for some Vietnamese grub!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest; probably would not have tried out Lang Van on my own if it hadn't been from the great reviews I'd heard from the group of ladies with whom I went to the restaurant last night. Am working to branch out my taste buds, and this was the perfect opportunity.   To start, the service was absolutely amazing. Our server apparently has a freakishly good memory as she remembered those in our group who had been there before, and in some cases, even what they ordered! Our beverages were refilled constantly and it took very little time for our food to come out after ordering off of the ridiculously large menu.  Of course a couple of us decided to customize our orders, so I had the lemongrass chicken vermacelli. It was fantastic - so many different flavors and semi-healthy with a ton of veggies. For appetizers we had the summer shrimp rolls and the temple tofu rolls; both were very good. And speaking of tofu, I have never been a big fan - something about the texture and overall squishiness of it, but Lang Van has made me a convert. I tried my friend's tofu with garlic sauce and it was out-of-this-world. Not sure I'll try tofu outside of Lang Van, but would definitely order it here again on my next trip. And the coconut curry dish that I tried had melt-in-your-mouth potatoes with exquisite flavor.   The inside of the restaurant is very clean and there is plenty of parking, although I was surprised at how busy it was for a Tuesday night. And if you can't decide what to order, tell the server what you like and she'll custom make a dish for you that you'll love. The meal ends with delicious bite-sized peanut butter cookies that puts a perfect sweet ending to a great dining experience."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a different restaurant in Charlotte and bravely drove to this area of town. The food was terrific and the employees were very friendly. My husband wants to try this place again soon."}
{"text":"Their com tam isn't bad, the portion seems not as large as some places but in reality is more than enough food. Their imperial rolls are probably the best in town too and aren't just frozen lumpia that are rebranded.  My girlfriend's canh cua wasn't as sour or salty as she likes it but as someone who normally feels like it's too sour and too salty I thought it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I went to lunch at Lang Van yesterday and really enjoyed the total experience. The service is exceptionally friendly and it seems to be a popular spot. The restaurant itself was clean and a bit nicer than I expected for that neighborhood. Our food was very quickly prepared so it also makes an ideal lunch spot .  I was disappointed to hear that they no longer serve banh mi's and  our server told us the menu was very old and insinuated it wasn't reliable, it made me question why they had menus at all.. perhaps it's time for an update.   We ordered the spring rolls with shrimp, and I loved the sauce but I'm actually curious to try the fried ones next time too, although these were very light and would make for a great summer dish.   I ended up going with the lemongrass curry dish as Lauryn recommended and it was quite good. Next time I will ask for that with veggies instead of the bed of lettuce. My friend just told the lady she like chicken and was up for anything and she had a nice chicken and veggie dish with noodles that was also really tasty. I will say it would be nice to know exactly what you're ordering so that you can get it again if you enjoy it. The average dish is about $11, which isn't the cheapest lunch but it is a lot of food and very fresh.   Overall I will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"I really have no clue about Vietnamese food.  I mean really.  About all I know is that I like it (like it, like it, yes I do).  But I have no idea what goes into it.  Sure, I watch Andrew Zimmern like the next guy, and figure since we are not actually in Vietnam, there probably is not any really odd stuff on the plate in front of me, but what do I really know?  Nothing.  Several years ago - by which I could really mean decades - a place I worked took me to Lang Van, which was no mean feat since we were way down on the south side of town.  A quick lunch outing rapidly turned into a couple of hours.  At the time, I really had little to no idea where we were, and it was probably a couple years before I figured out just where this little hole-in-the-wall was located.  Once I did, it was a nice surprise, and even more so when I figured out that the menu was mostly for show unless you really knew what you wanted.  Since I have no idea, it is almost always better just to talk to the server.  The problem there is that it can be completely hit or miss.  Not the food, but the server.  Sometimes they seem to speak very well and understand you well.  Other times, not so much.  The good news is that the food will generally be solid all around.  While the neighborhood is not the best, the parking lot is on the small side, and the communication can be iffy, it is definitely worth a trip.  Just skip that menu - more than once we have actually spotted something (for instance, the elusive banh mi), only to be told it is not available.  Check that at the door and you should be just fine."}
{"text":"Lang Van is great and offers pretty much all the same items as Ben Thanh, but, although I can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly, I prefer Ben Thanh to Lang Van.  I usually find myself here on Wednesdays, when Ben Thanh is closed and I'm craving some Tofu with Garlic Sauce."}
{"text":"I've been here a several times and for the most part the food tastes good, but almost unfailingly, I get stomach cramps after eating here.  I keep trying to go back after I forget about the gastro problems. Most of the staff and Dan, the boss lady, are very friendly and I believe genuinely so, but some in a very fake and dishonest way.  In at least 2 of my visits including my last visit, the bill was added up incorrectly.  The first time, I thought it was just an honest mistake and let it slide.  The 2nd time, I confronted the short girl at the register and she lied straight to my face that the menu price was incorrect (which would be an illegal bait and switch tactic. Your advertised price even if incorrect is what you must charge), she made up some new price and asked me with a sly smile, \"would you like me to add it up again?\"  (as in, are you serious? do you want me to take the time to add up your bill again while I am so crazy super busy?) I didn't want to cause a scene as there were many people waiting in line to get in and they were very busy.  I said, \"no that's fine if you are sure it's correct\".  I still knew in the back of my mind that even with the made up price, the numbers still didn't add up.  The deception was intentional and even when confronted she didn't back down to correct the intended over charge.  Like I said, I've been many times and the food is good, but I will not continue to patronize a business with dishonest people trying to cheat you.  If you decide to go anyway, make sure you have your calculators out and add up the check from the menu prices before you order as the bill is presented in Vietnamese and you won't be able to read it or make any sense of it as it is not itemized with individual prices.  Hopefully, going forward, now that the secret is out, they will stop this age old practice of over charging.  This is not something new, it's been done for centuries especially in China.  It's something that is very hard to spot and often even if it is noticed after the fact, most people would just let it go and like me figure it was an honest mistake and say, oh it's just a few extra dollars."}
{"text":"Came here with friends who never have eaten Vietnamese before.  Whenever I take a newbie to a Vietnamese restaurant I always recommend the Com Suon Noung ( Grilled Pork Chop over broken rice).  My friends weren't adventurous for it so they ordered something else.  I went ahead and got the pork chop.  It was so disappointing.  It was more like a flatten medallion pork.  I couldn't take the lemongrass, shallots, or anything else for that matter.  My friend ordered the fried rice, didn't finish it and didn't want to take the leftovers home with her either.    I gave the restaurant a second chance the following night.  Pretty much the same.  Nem Nuong (meatball) had too much 5 spice seasoning.  The Canh Chua had whole pieces of okra which is a no-no for me."}
{"text":"Our family of 4 all enjoyed the food with very high quality and fresh ingredients.  Don't let the exterior fool you.  The interior is really quaint and nice."}
{"text":"I love the variety on the menu because everything is great here. It's the best service in town and everyone here is SO friendly. I will always return to Lang Van--sometimes twice a week!"}
{"text":"This was my first time. The menu is a little overwhelming but with a little help from the server, you can get through it. This place is really a hidden gem. Seemed to be a lot of regulars. As everyone says, don't let the location throw you. Can't wait to explore digger deeper into the menu!"}
{"text":"Supurb, fresh, delightful, and healthy cuisine. I wish we lived closer, but we frequently make the drive and usually try to take someone new to surprise them with our special place. The owner has watched my child grow up. The summer rolls with fresh shrimp and sensational peanut sauce is to die for. Such fresh ingredients and awesome staff makes this one if not my favorite place to dine out. It's best to get there early. I'm stuck on the special hot pot with extra tomato rice. I've tried quiet a few menu items but the hot pot is my favorite. If you don't know what to order just tell the waitress what you like and they will make sure you are pleased."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. Given the location (Shamrock and Eastway), it would be easy to completely bypass or disregard this place. But in my opinion, it's one of the Queen City's gems.  I usually get my order to go, but it's always a real treat when I do get to eat there. The staff is friendly. The service is top notch. Don't know what you want? Tell your server what you like. He/she will help you order. If you're even a semi regular, they remember what you want... even down to the beverage. And I can promise you that your drink will never go empty. Someone is always there ready to fill your glass... sometimes after your first sip!  I love pho, or as I call it comfort in a bowl. My standard order is Pho Bo Vien (rice noodle soup with meatballs), spring rolls, and fresh summer rolls. Now you see why I often opt to pick it up... so no one can judge me on the amount of food I consume.  Lang Van is great place for those engaged in a mad, passionate love affair with Vietnamese food and also for the newbies. If you're a little weary about giving Vietnamese a try... don't be!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is watching and cozy. The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable boo the menu. I had the pineapple rice with tofu.  Not a fan of tofu but the rest of the pineapple dish was delicious. Next time I will be sure to try a dish that includes shrimp."}
{"text":"I really wish I had stopped by sooner! I've been here twice and neither time was disappointing. The second time I came I ordered Banh Xeo pancakes with tofu - with it (as you can see from my picture) come lots of fresh vegetables and mint to wrap it in. The avocado smoothie I ordered was great too - not sweet which I like. The service is superb - I came with a friend who is a long time customer and essentially told the owner to \"surprise him\" which she did. The personable atmosphere along with the A-1 food make this a must-eat destination for Vietnamese in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese food and consistently friendly service every time I've been.  I love the soup and the summer rolls!!"}
{"text":"We ate our last meal in Charlotte for our Christmas vacation here.  The place was decorated really festively for the holidays.  The ambiance was warm, welcoming, and vibrant.  It was really busy during lunch time, and the tables were turning over rapidly.  Despite crowd, we were greeted immediately after walking through the door and seated pretty quickly.  Hubby and brother split the spring rolls as an appetizer.  They were nice enough to cut the 2 rolls into 4 pieces for the table, but my mom and I decided to wait for our dishes.  Our server didn't even need to write down our orders.  Hubby and I started with the Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk.  The ratio of milk to coffee was a little too much.  I guess I could have not mixed the entire thing together.  I had the vermicelli noodles with the shrimp on sugar cane and imperial rolls (fried pork rolls) which was delicious.  The portion was just right and I devoured the entire thing.  Mom had a different noodle dish which had all the sauce already mixed, which was a little surprising.  It was almost more an Americanized version of beef and broccoli.  Looking around, it was definitely a place that catered to non-Asian customers..it had to be being in the heart of Charlotte!  Both Hubby and brother had different versions of the beef pho.  The broth was flavorful.  The meal was a nice, healthier way to end our week long holiday vacation."}
{"text":"Somebody told us this place was the best in Charlotte. Somebody lied. The tofu rolls were pretty decent but the main dishes we tried, including the vermicelli and pho, were not what we were used to and just weren't very good. Service was quick though, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Amazinggggggg place , the avocado milkshake is so yummmmmm.vegetarian options are very good.people are friendly and treat everyone very warmly."}
{"text":"Owner is there everyday and she will rember you! Fresh great flavors.  Everything is wonderful but #8 app and #27 pho are my staples - try em and thank me later"}
{"text":"We went without a reservation at about 715 on a Saturday night, and although there was a line, only waited about 15 minutes for a table. Unfortunately, that good thing is also the only thing I can ding this place for, and that is they do rush to get you out of there, and I don't like to be rushed when eating.  Otherwise, this place is amazing. This is the third time I have been here and I love it. I could not wait to bring my visiting daughter here and she was blown away also.  She ordered the Bun Nem Nuong (meatball with vermicelli),and although the flavors were amazing, I think she was a little disappointed that the meat was actually more like a slice of barbequed spam. I had the same type of dish, but with sliced beef and salad and it was excellent. I have traveled to Vietnam, so I have to say that this visit to Lang Van was like the others, in that the food is very authentic.  We both ordered a Vietnamese \"33\" beer - ice cold and great with the meal.  Unfortunately, every time I put my chopsticks down for a moment, someone would come and try to take my bowl. I did not know how to impress upon our server to back off without being rude, but she was good natured when I just kept saying, \"please, not yet.\" Nonetheless, I love Lang Van, and can't imagine not going back."}
{"text":"we had a group of 10 here, including a 2 year old, on a weekend night, and they were very gracious and friendly.  everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered, which included pho, bun, some fancy thing that involved wrapping your food in pancakes, and a number of appetizers.    i had pho, and it was everything i wanted it to be - comforting, aromatic, good amount of meat, ample plate of stuff to throw in it.  it isn't the best broth i've ever had, but it was perfectly satisfying."}
{"text":"There is a reason they've won \"Best Of\" seven years in a row.  I try to come here every time I come to Charlotte, and it never disappoints.  Super friendly staff and very helpful with suggestions (you'll never have an empty glass either).  The noodle bowl was fantastic, I almost ordered one to take back home for later!  Pho is also super tasty, but it's hard for me to decide which one to get sometimes.  I'm actually already thinking about what I'll get the next time I come to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"My family has been going to Lang Van for over 10 years. The owner is one of the nicest people I have ever met, and I have no idea how she remembers everyone's name and favorite dish.   We have tried a lot of the different dishes on the menu, from Pho, Curry, Yellow Pancakes, to the Hot Pot and we have never been disappointed.   I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"As often as I come here, I can't believe I've never written a review. Probably because I'm too busy downing delicious Pho .   I came here for the first time on a Friday in the fall in search of Charlotte's best Pho. And after kissing a few Pho frogs . I found my Pho-ever Prince  Thanks to Yelp for the advice.   When I first visited it was for lunch and the parking lot was packed. I knew right then that this was it.   When I walked in, I was still greeted warmly and seated immediately.  With very little hesitation, I ordered the Pho Tai. After 10 maybe 15 min a huge, piping-hot bowl of pho  arrived. (Note: They only do one size of Pho and it's huge but trust me you'll want it all.)   Before I even added a sprig of basil, a spritz of lemon , a slice of jalapeño or a bean sprout, I leaned in and took a spoonful of broth. It was heavenly, flavorful umami goodness. I grabbed my chopsticks and sampled the  beef: it was tender and flavorful. The perfect melding of flavors left me wondering: did the beef flavor the broth or did the broth flavor the beef?  (Chicken or the egg ) The noodles still had that perfect al dente texture. All of the condiments were super fresh. I added them all and then I ate until I couldn't eat anymore. I didn't want to waste even a drop of broth.   That's how I fell in love with Lang Van. Afterwards...  I ate Pho here everyday for a week. No exaggeration. It is legitimately it's good.   Since our first encounter I've also had the tofu bun and both the shrimp and tofu summer rolls both of which are divine and the pho chay (tofu bun).   Beware: the sauce that comes with the summer rolls is so delicious you could drink it.   But alas, the pho is my first love. A healing serum for the soul. If I'm sick and won't eat anything else, I will always eat pho . But it's gotta be from here. All other Pho shall forever pale in comparison.   If you're on the fence about this you shouldn't be. I love Lang Van so much that I'm willing to share her with everyone! Don't shirk my kindness. Nike said it best, \"Just Do It.\"  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"In the 13 years I have lived in Charlotte, Lang Van is always a joy and never disappoints. The service is top notch and I never have to worry about what to order. The vegetables are cooked to perfection without being over cooked mush. Everything is cooked fresh and delicious. Thanks again for always being dependable and delicious."}
{"text":"Best Pho not only in town but probably some of the best I've ever had hands down. I typically go with the normal pho with rare steak and thick noodles.   The lady who runs it literally remembers you and what you ordered after a visit or two. It's incredible and bizarre; I love it!  Everything is always fresh, hot and consistently outstanding. I can't stress it enough...if you want pho and you're in town don't think about anywhere else. I've never had anything but their pho so I can't speak to their other cuisine."}
{"text":"Lang Van is a little overpriced and overrated.  Sure, the food is good, but it is Americanized Vietnamese and I guess it shows since the clientele are mostly American.  We went on a Friday night and the restaurant was very busy.  So busy that we got the last remaining open table.  We ordered fried spring rolls and two bowls of pho dac biet.  Whenever I get pho, I always order the dac biet since it includes everything.  The dac biet here was seriously lacking in ingredients and portion size.  I finished my bowl in no time and I did not leave full.  This is the first time a bowl of pho did not fill me up.  Not only that, but one bowl is $8.95!  (Bowls at most other pho shops start at $2-3 less.)  Maybe I'm just used to all the Vietnamese pho shops up and down Buford Highway in Atlanta, but the pho here was kind of a joke.  There were much less noodles and no tripe in the soup.  Also, instead of giving us limes to eat with the pho, they gave us *lemons* - another first.  Anyhow, while the food itself is good, the portions are lacking and the prices are jacked up.  I'm sure there are better, more authentic Viet places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Always fresh and friendly, staff stays right on top of things and the kitchen is always spot on"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Lang Van for almost 20 years and have NEVER had a bad meal. They are the model of consistency. The food is fresh, tasty, fairly priced while the service is superb as they treat you like family while you are there. It's been my old reliable go to place in Charlotte for a very long time, please keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Amazing Vietnamese dining experience. Second best pho in Charlotte, with Doan's being first (better pho broth and beef). Will frequently come back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty authentic.  The atmosphere is ok, nothing special..very clean.  The service was somewhat uninviting and a little rude.  When there was a problem with the pricing on the check, I was told there was no manger available to speak with me.  I was told I would have to come back another time.  I thought that was weird. I would try again though for the food."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. The people were nice and the food was good. My 4 stars are only because I'm not a Vietnamese food person. Sorry. I went here with some co-workers today. I ordered the number 108 with shrimp. It was pretty good. My co-workers love Vietnamese food, it's just not my favorite, but this place was pretty good."}
{"text":"And with last night's dinner, my love of LV has lessened a fair bit.  Specials prices continue to climb, and at 15 bucks for a pile of soggy spaghetti-like noodles, a weird, sweet, shrimp-tasting sauce, and 6 pieces of tofu... well, it's just too much cash and sadness for a chef-boyardeed Viet classic. No sharp flavors. No texture. Just a limp pile of blech.  Banh Xeo - still delish - but smaller, less filling. Detached stuffings, so an already challenging to eat plate becomes annoying.  Corners are being cut here, to the detriment of flavor, but it won't impact their mainstay clientele - which love the obsessive-servitude, the \"you won't like that, try this\" attitude. The service has never been charming to me, and it's just not worth an arm in the face every 3 minutes if the food's not up to par. Which, for moi, it isn't any longer. Ah well. They'll be fine."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  Had the Yellow Pancake last night as an appetizer and it was fabulous!  It was our first time with a Yellow Pancake so the server asked if she could \"wash hands and show you how to do it.\"  Yes, the Lemongrass Curry was awesome and spicy, yeeehawww!  The food is expertly complimented by the best front of house staff!  The service at Lang Van is second to none.  You see, I do not eat rice or noodles so my ordering experience can be a bit comical but our server gave suggestions, asked preferences, and all of this was done with patience and smiles! Most of my family isn't that patient and kind!  Oh, and the atmosphere.  Casual and quite nice inside. A li'l sketchy walking up to it but once inside you know you hit the jackpot!"}
{"text":"Lang Van is the bomb. Never been treated rudely and the food is on spot, but I will say, that anyone who expects to be seated 10:45 at night when a place closes at 11:00 is the one who is rude and inconsiderate, not the restaurant. I could see if you come upon a place and have no idea what their hours are and the management seats you at their discretion, but to knowingly go for dine-in when someplace is going to close in fifteen minutes is just uncouth. Ever hear of take-out? Even bars stop serving food at a particular hour. I wonder if the person who gave it one star would do the same in whatever business they work in. Do offices stay open past five to accomodate rude clientle that show up two minutes before? They won't even pick up the phone past 4:30--so please--in all fairness, give a review that makes sense."}
{"text":"Lang Van never fails to disappoint. While I never deviate from my usual m, I have tasted many friends' dishes and they are always scrumptious and worth raving about as well. I love bringing first timers too--they are welcomed and cheered with open arms and, if undecided about the main course, the owner is always happy to serve up a dish based on taste preferences... and even those surprise dishes keep the patrons happy and full! Best Vietnamese, best Asian food in the QC!"}
{"text":"The menu to me was super overwhelming, however the waitress was helpful in identifying a dish that I would like. They left a pitcher of sweet tea and water on our table and came over often to refill our drinks. However, once we had nearly finished our meals, they didn't refill the pitcher anymore. I guess they decided we weren't thirsty anymore.   I ordered #105 spicy. It was good, although I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of shrimp. I counted five shrimp to begin with and had hoped for more. That being said, the flavor was delicious and I really liked the rice noodles.   Overall, this place is alright. I wouldn't be opposed to going back but I don't think I will go running back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING! Some of the best service I have ever received and food that is rocking my world as we speak. We were a little clueless so the waitress stepped in and brought us a curry and a noodle dish she enjoyed. I never knew that very could  e this phenomemal!! We will absolutely be back.... maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"Lang Van is an institution. Everything is an experience worth having: the staff, the pineapple fried rice, the house hot pot, any variation of Pho and best of all: the crispy quail and summer rolls!"}
{"text":"One of the two best vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte.  The service is exceptional, and the food saviory.  It is located in a shady part, but well lite parking lot.  Plus the restaurant is clean.    Their pancake, and tofu spinach is amazing, and healthy.  Stay away from their Phos.  Not enough meat and too much broth."}
{"text":"LAAAAAME.  They looked a little annoyed that we came in at 9, even though they close at 10.   $5.60 for a pot of tea for 4.  $46.32 total for 3 bowls of hu tieu, and an order of spring rolls.   2 of us ordered the \"house special\" (dac biet), but our three bowls looked exactly the same. Think, 70% soup, 25% noodles, and 5% meat. I've attached a picture of my bowl upon arrival for reference.    Pass this place, folks!"}
{"text":"Discovered this by accident, but those are the best discoveries aren't they?  Well if not for you I don't care, but this place has the best pho I've ever had. No joke, hands down, best pho I've ever had.   Even though I'm white I like to think I know good viet cuisine when I have, I was thoroughly surprised at how good the pho was. The place had a funny smell, could have been my company, but bla bla bla THE PHO IS GOOD!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden jewel!  The food is full of flavor and the service is great. There are choices available for anyone's food desires. I give 2 thumps up for the ginger chicken and the pho bowl. I have tried the spring rolls and veggie rolls and we're not that impressed. The restaurant is a must try for anyone who loves flavorable Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Spring rolls... that is all. So delicious . I'll definitely be back again..: and again!"}
{"text":"Very good food. The menu is EXTENSIVE! I could look for an hour and nut decide what I want. I ended up askingthe waitress what I should get based on what I liked. Whatever I got it was yummy."}
{"text":"This place is usally packed with family or friends, but I have been fortunate to have never had to wait. I love the vegetarian options. My favorite is the tofu and asparagus. Wait, anything with flat noodles. Oh and how can I forget the curry bowls. Don't judge me it is a 9 page menu, which can be overwhelming. I am excited to keep trying more options as I continue to live here in Charlotte. I will take my mom next month when she visits so I will update my review then. She is going to love it. Everyone else that has came with me enjoys it. Lang Van makes me happy to live in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Lunch time mid week is the time to go to avoid the crowds. The menu is a bit pricey for what it is to be honest with you, but if you order wisely you can still get a decent value. My go to lunch is an order of summer rolls and an order of jicama tofu rolls - 4 rolls for about $8. Fresh and light lunch for under $10, score! Service is always on point and you can expect consistency in terms of freshness and quality.   This place gets crowded especially on Friday nights and with the after church crowd, so my advice would be to avoid on Sundays unless you want to wait in line."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Valentine's Day and we were very impressed.  My husband and I went to Vietnam for our honeymoon, so we are constantly on the lookout for the best Vietnamese places.  There was a tiny wait when we got there, but it was to be expected on Valentine's Day. The staff was very kind and got us seated as quickly as they could. And everyone is right, they do not let your water Get Low ever.  We ordered an appetizer that I haven't been able to find since our trip to Vietnam. It is a pork dish where you assemble spring rolls yourself and top it with peanut sauce. It is delicious. I felt it was a bit pricey at $15, but so worth it.  My husband ordered pho and I had Curry. The pho was the obvious winner. Large portion for the price.   Not Vietnamese prices unfortunately, haha. Everything was very good. Our new Vietnamese staple."}
{"text":"Lang Van - I heard the absolute most about this restaurant. The absolute most. its on several lists as being a great lunch spot and its cuisine is supposed to be delicious.   Disclaimer- I am from NYC and our Asian food is nearly unparalleled outside of California and Asian countries. ( proud NJ/NYC foodie)   However - I was not impressed with the food at all. It was super basic. The flavors weren't large or bright and the herbs didn't work to brighten any spices that may or may not have been cooked in the food.   Honestly the service was the highlight. The staff appeared to be very knowledgeable about the patrons and many seemed to have lasting ling term relationships. Great.   The location is a little shady and the outside is not pretty at all.   But I want delicious Vietnamese Food that makes me feel like I am eating something fresh and authentic.. not white washed bland Asian food.   I would go again... but I would not take anyone here..."}
{"text":"Came here when i was in town based on the good reviews on Yelp.  Ordered a rice dish with meat (forgot if it was pork or beef)) , and it was 80% rice, 10% vegetables (tomatoes, lettuce, etc.) and 10% MEAT! My grilled skewer had 4 EXTREMELY SMALL pieces of meat on it, not even enough to fill up the whole skewer.  It was obvious that they were being stingy on their meat. The portion was so sad.  I've been to many Vietnamese restaurants in different cities (and even others in Charlotte) and have never been served so little meat for this dish.  Basically paid for a plate of rice and some vegetables. Some of my friends' dishes were better, but as for mine, it was so pathetic that I would never recommend anyone to come here.  Wish I might have had a better experience by ordering something else, but a restaurant can't skimp out on their main ingredients so obviously like that.  One of my friends ordered the Pho and it was lacking on meat, too..but not as badly as my dish.  Only thing I liked about the place was the Vietnamese coffee, but that's definitely not enough to redeem them. Not ever coming back here again!"}
{"text":"The service is 5 stars. The food is awesome. This is the Vietnamese restaurant that you should not miss when you're here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The staff is fun and friendly and the food comes out fast for such quality meals.  I would rate this as the top for Vietnamese stir fry dishes in the city. Viet Thai has the top pho, but Lang van kills it on every other dish available. The lemongrass tofu is excellent and can be made very spicy if needed. I have not been let down here. I just wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Gave 3 stars based on no kids menu and the price is high for pho. Great service. Looks run down on the outside but nice and clean on the inside. Pho was too Americanized. Had vegetables in it and what tasted like garlic."}
{"text":"It was an hour drive but I  love Vietnamese food and everything I've tried closer was just so so. We moved here from DC and we were used to awesome Vietnamese with easy access. As we got closer the neighborhood made me apprehensive... and we were prepared to drive past but once we walked it we were blown away. The service was so friendly, and the food was completely worth the drive! We will return soon."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places to eat.  The building is unassuming, but if you drive by this place and do not stop, big mistake.   During my most recent visit here, I went with the Charlotte Veggies Meet Up group.  There were seven of us, and they had positioned tables to make an eating space for us. Service here is always impeccable.  During this visit, the server brought us complimentary summer rolls featuring crispy tofu and the most incredible peanut sauce. For my meal, I ordered number 72, fried rice noodle with mixed vegetables and crispy tofu in garlic sauce.  I liberally added their wonderful hot sauce and was in pure heaven.  They also offer wine and beer, so I enjoyed their house Chardonnay after a hard day's work. At the end of the meal, we were given a plate of sweets.  Fortune cookies, little candies, these round cake like things and this sesame covered delicacy filled with bean paste.  I am not a dessert person, but these morsels were not cloyingly sweet. The menu is very extensive, and Lang Van boasts that they can turn any dish into a veg friendly one.   Veggies and hot sauce!  Just my style."}
{"text":"Certainly an acceptable meal, but not very special. Might be better to have a reduced menu of offerings and to upgrade quality of ingredients such as beef. We had a beef pho and lemongrass beef curry. Each was ok, the pho better than the other dish. At $3.75 for two tiny spring rolls, that seemed excessive. Tasty spring rolls though. A somewhat better value were the summer rolls with shrimp and a delicious hoisin/peanut sauce. Service was gracious and above average and the atmosphere was fine."}
{"text":"Remembering my most recent trip to Lang Van, it was odd that my water glass actually sat half empty for more than a few minutes, but it's nothing to complain about, just an anomaly in the service that usually is lang van (if you haven't realized this from all the other reviews)  I am almost always happy with what I order, though the few times they've tried to steer me away from a dish, I wish I would have listened. The first time I tried to order the banh xeo they tried to discourage me, even after I told them I've consumed it many times before, and when it arrived I knew why - slightly sub-par. Of course it was still delicious, but not the best in town. (lots and lots of pancakeness... not a lot of filling.) The second was the rice crepes (banh cuon), again with them asking if I was really sure, and then upon receiving the dish again feeling like I ordered something they really hate to make.   As far as everything else goes - I love it. Flavorful meats, good buns and phos, nice curries, anything they recommend is fantastic, and the service is great (even better if you have a baby at the table) - I just wish I wasn't slightly limited.   Overall: fast, friendly, tasty Vietnamese. (but if you're looking for a great banh xeo - try ben thanh!)"}
{"text":"My first time and it was GREAT!!!  The atmosphere... The PHO.... DELICIOUS!!! They have a new customer!"}
{"text":"We were in the area for Carolina Rebellion, and being that I'm homesick and missing my mom's cooking I searched for a vietnamese restuarant to go to.  I should have turned around and left the restuarant when I walked in and was greeted by Vietnamese people dressed up in uniforms and acting all friendly.  I know there is nothing wrong with friendly service, but this restuarant is geared more to white people, and they charge you out the behind for the amount of food that you are getting.  This might be the fact that we are in the \"south\" and there isn't a large Vietnamese population in NC.  If you are in Seattle, San Diego, or Boston, a small bowl is probably $5-6 and a large is $7-8 or so.    When you first come in they'll seat you and come back in like 5 minutes or so and ask you if you want appetizers.    Ordered Bo Bia spring rolls for apps, cause I haven't had them in a while. They are good.  I ordered the Banh Canh Cua, and the waiter tried to suggest that I order something else, because he didn't think I knew what I was ordering.  I stuck with what I wanted, and the food came out in a huge bowl which barely had any food and lots of broth.  This dish is suppossed to have long strands of thick white noodles (about 6 inches in length), and I got 1/2 inch strands of noodles that looked like they were meant for a little kid who couldn't use chopsticks to eat.  OH  and Cua is crab, and guess what I got instead, imitation crab.  For $8.95, I pretty much got a kids portion of food.   The husband ordered the a pho dac biet, and they bring out a pho with only slices of beef and charged him $9.95 or so for a kids size amount of noodles and beef with tons of broth, which should have come out with meatballs, tendons, and bunch of other stuff.  The broth was good, but it was salty.  I love salt, but if you have their broth, plan to be really thirsty later on.    Don't get me wrong, their food taste authentic, its just they have taken short cuts on quality and portion size to the American Clientel that they have visiting the establishment.  They time we were there, the only people I saw was white.    Atmosphere, its kind of weird that they partioned the dining room in to two sections by bamboo divinding thingys.  You are seated in these green booths, and if you are above average size i think they have tables and chairs.   The restuarant was kinda dark and dingy in my opinion, and they have vietnamese style music playing in the background.   I think that Durham has better Vietnamese food in NC.  The price is about the same in Durham, but the quality and amount of food that you get is what you are paying for.    Side question: why are you being offered a fortune cookie, tamrand candy, and sesame cookie at the end of the meal?  I didn't know I was eating at a chinese restuarant."}
{"text":"I've been 2 times and both times phenomenal. I've only gotten the 61 and the 60 (vermicelli dishes) along with the shrimp spring rolls w peanut sauce, and that's all I want anytime I have a hankering for noodles. This place is a+ and the service had a rotation of people assisting so I never wanted for anything."}
{"text":"So good, very authentic, customer service on point! We will definitely be going back. We asked the waitress for suggestions and were not disappointed. Really well priced too!"}
{"text":"It's Pho-nomenal! Delicious coconut curry, tofu temple rolls and Thai coffee. I'm a regular here, go at least once a week and adore the owner."}
{"text":"Wow I know this place looks like a hole in the wall, but do not pass it up! The menu is huge and I didn't see one plate in the place that didn't look amazing. Also if you don't know what to get they will suggest something perfect for you. It has been a long time that I went somewhere for lunch and really wanted to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"The dining room was full but we were seated immediately.  The ladies were very nice and anxious to provide great service. I was in the mood for something healthier for my body so I ordered the vegetable delights with grilled chicken as this meal is prepared with no oil and less sodium. The meal is served with steamed rice.  The chicken was flattened perhaps too much there was a minimum amount of plain white meat.  However, I left with the feeling I wanted and that was not to feel stuffed.  I look forward to returning to the restaurant to try one of their hot pot dishes which I expect will grant them a higher rating on my part."}
{"text":"Went here last night for my friends Foodie & Fellowship event and it was awesome! The staff is friendly and knew the menu like the back of their hand. Our waitress answered the many questions that everyone had with ease and offered great suggestions. The owner was working hard helping her servers clear tables as well as checking on the guests. We were a group of 10 and all of our food came out hot and fast. Now the menu, at first sight was pretty overwhelming especially for someone that's not too familiar with Vietnamese food because there's soooo many options but since I was with a group that eats it often plus our server, I was in good hands. I went for the fresh summer rolls with the special peanut sauce as a starter and they were so fresh & flavorful. For my entree I ordered #37 which was Hu Tieu Dax Biet (crab, shrimp, roast pork, baby rib in a rice noodle soup) & the bowl was about dry when I finished! With this winter fastly approaching, I will be ordering this flavorful warm delicious dish a few more times on them cold evenings! Can't wait to try some other things on the menu as well!"}
{"text":"I love that the owner remembers her customers and what they have had and liked in the past. The food is really good. I have enjoyed a variety of dishes here."}
{"text":"Lang Van was a very unexpected surprise. Our group originally was going to head over to Ben Than, but saw it was closed on Wednesdays. Hoping to get our Vietnamese fix we searched Yelp! for ideas and were not disappointed.  This place was able to seat our group of 7 at their large circle table. The staff was friendly and very helpful with any menu questions we had. If you like a good sweet iced coffee try it here! It's fun to make and yummy to drink. Hot coffee filters through your cup onto some good ole sweetened condensed milk, just stir and pour over your ice and BAM instant deliciousness.  Be prepared for a large menu, I can only say I got the #109 which was very good. A healthy helping of vegtables, and beef with a side of rice.  I also shared some garden rolls with my co-workers. Very good.  Everyone had a great time and the food was all around delicious, we will be back!"}
{"text":"So I just tried Lang Van last night for the first time after hearing rave reviews from so many people and I was absolutely floored by the taste explosion in my mouth.  The complexity of flavors and the perfect combination of ingredients makes for an experience that far surpasses any expectations I had.   The portion sizes are perfect-not too big and not too small, the service was superb and the special dessert treat at the end by far beat the fortune cookie you usually get. ( but don't worry, if you love fortune cookies, you get one of those too!)  When is it too soon to go back???"}
{"text":"I am Vietnamese.   I am picky with Viet food. I had the hu tieu dac biet, and my boyfriend the sour and sweet soup.  Flavor was great and wasn't overboard with spices.   Happy we found this spot.  Service is very friendly and everyone speaks English. Clean and bathrooms are clean too. Enjoy. :) looking forward to trying more things when I'm in town lots of the food that came out looked delicious."}
{"text":"Wow. Why I have I not tried this ace until now? It's right down the street from me and thanks to my friend visiting I had the pleasure of having my taste buds aroused once again. Personally I am not a fan of pho but I will say I tried my friends and I was happy. What I had was awesome. Lemon grass beef. Which you can also order in chicken and tofu. What an amazing dish which you can order to you liking of spicy. Be careful because if you do not specify it will be hot! This is served over lemon grass and bean sprouts. It's almost like an amazing spicy salad with wonderfully cooked beef. Served with white rice. Eat with chop sticks and boom your done. I can't wait to eat here again. This place has an amazing menu and I want to try everything."}
{"text":"Lang Van is a true example of what exceptional customer service is.  While this is probably my favorite Vietnamese place in Charlotte, I don't come here as often as I would like. That being said, the staff makes a true connection with customers.   Last time we were in, the owner greeted me with a hug and ask where my mom was. The last time we had been in (months ago!), we brought my mom with us.  How could she have remembered that??  With the hundreds of customers, I'm always impressed with the staff remembers our last order, or a favorite drink.  Top notch!  Food is fresh and flavorful. We like to do the build-you-own spring rolls, but have enjoyed the crispy yellow pancakes, and the shrimp and pork spring rolls. Pho is great, but so is literally everything else on the menu. Branch out - try to chicken lemongrass or a vermicelli dish!   Will continue to recommend Lang Van as a great spot!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Lang Van!  There are at least 3 meals that I crave on a constant basis.  The customer service is exemplary and the food is just the best Vietnamese on the East Coast.  Love coming here."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  Authentic Vietnamese food and every time we go there the owner remembers exactly what we get, even when we skip months on dining there.  I recommend the tofu hot pot and crispy quail!"}
{"text":"Clean gourmet style pho restaurants are somewhat of an oxymoron. Most pho joints cater to the Asian public and personal experience has taught me that cleanliness and service aren't exactly top selling points. Lang Van is step away from that generalization; quite clean with impeccable service.   While the water was always full and plates were swiftly picked up, that service isn't quite what I was expecting. I'm the type that eats slow and enjoys lingering with my bowl of pho, sipping my broth even after the noodles are done. The broth here is quiet tasty, and when the waiter asked if I was finished, I felt obligated to save face and not look like a total oink. There's a fine line between good service and rushing a customer and I seem to be stuck somewhere in the middle of that line.   Fried spring rolls are top notch, but overall the pho is just mediocre. It's pricey and the portions appear to be child like. Noodles were scarce and the Dac Biet (special) was lacking a lot of meats. There wasn't anything special about it. I guess I should have read the description prior to ordering.   I know there's some method of madness to sit customers in a certain section, but with an empty restaurant, do you seriously have to sit us right smack next to someone? One of my pet peeves, sorry.   Lang Van still isn't my favorite, but cleanliness and good service is something that can't be overlooked."}
{"text":"Lang Van never disappoints! The garlic tofu bowl is my absolute favorite, which makes it hard to try other things! Our friend had a steamed basket this last time we were there and it was super tasty! The waitresses are super helpful and are not afraid to give you a recommendation, which I really appreciate. Top of the meal with a Vietnamese coffee and you've got yourself one heck of a meal!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, such wonderful staff!  Lang Van is the real thing serving Vietnamese food.  Love it every time I visit."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to this place I always tell myself I am going to just tell them a number and go from there. I always end up getting some kind of roll from the appetizer section and usually phu. It is an amazing place though a little hard to find."}
{"text":"So rude!   They close at 11pm.  I called at 10:15 to find out if we arrived at 10:45, would we be seated.   I was told yes.   However, when arrived at 10:45 as soon as we got to the door the owner hurried up and locked the door.   When I knocked and told her that we called in advance and were assured that we would be seated, She unlocked and cracked the door and said \"sorry,\" and closed the door in my face.   If you're open until 11, be professional and stay open until the time you say you are!    Will not return."}
{"text":"At long last, my search for good, authentic Vietnamese food has finally ended. Thanks to Yelp and a recommendation from a Vietnamese woman, I tried Lang Van for lunch and I'm only sorry that I didn't try it sooner. In my opinion, this place is head and shoulders above Ben Thanh, in every aspect.    I'll stop comparing prices with SoCal. It seems that Vietnamese food is generally $2.00 more than in SoCal, but for once, the food is worth it.   The neighborhood isn't the greatest. The exterior may not look like much. But what it has going for it is easy parking, a pleasantly decorated interior, very friendly and attentive service and pretty outstanding Vietnamese food.   We were warmly greeted by the family who runs the restaurant. The people who work here are really, really nice. They have a large menu with some great staples and some unique dishes.   My husband's favorite is the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio. I felt a little more adventurous and had the Cary Ga (yellow chicken curry). See my photos for Lang Van.   The portion here is just right, bordering on the more generous side. Everything is carefully prepared, perfectly flavored and well-presented. I have not a single complaint (and I'm admittedly, a Vietnamese food snob).   It's evident that the chefs here have skills, a refined palatte and stay true to the dish.  The meat for the Bun Thit Nuong was perfectly cooked and delicious. Ample vermicelli noodles, meat, lettuce, mint and my favorite crushed peanuts on top. This is a pretty accessible dish for beginners (slightly sweet, savory, lots of textures).  I rarely ever order yellow chicken curry at a Vietnamese restaurant because I remember how my mom used to make it and I'm always disappointed. Lang Van makes it even better. It's nothing like Thai curry (so don't expect it), but it is healthier and more delicately flavored. Sweet potatoes, onions, broth, curry flavor and tender chicken served with your choice of rice or baguette. I went with rice. Even my husband enjoyed it. But it's not for everyone, especially those who are used to thick coconut sauce Thai curry. This is more soupy in texture, but just as delicious.   I will definitely be back here again. Not only was the Vietnamese food here good by Charlotte standards, it was good by any city's standards, probably some of the best, simple Vietnamese food I've had in a long time. Charlotte needs more Vietnamese restaurants like this one. This is a must try for any Vietnamese food aficionado and if you've never had Vietnamese food, try this one and you're likely to convert."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Charlotte.   We raised our daughters eating here at least monthly since the late 90s.  The best.    Try the make your own Vietnamese burrito (rice paper) with tofu (#11 or so).  So light and veggie/herby.     Such wonderful servers and service."}
{"text":"My newest addiction. There's not much I can add that hasn't already been covered in other reviews, but this place is worth the trip. I recommend the Pho Tai. The portion sizes are big - I typically stretch one order into 2-3 meals."}
