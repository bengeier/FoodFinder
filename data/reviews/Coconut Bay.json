{"text":"The food was ok, but the old Asian man was very rude to the customers and the waitress, I could even hear him blaming the waitress and cursing customers while I was eating. Very uncomfortable experience. I do not recommend this awful place..."}
{"text":"This place was good!  We ordered the Malaysian satay chicken & shrimp pad thai, bean sprout soy egg soft noodle, and fried wontons. The wontons were crazy delicious, the bean sprout egg noodles were also very tasty. The satay pad thai wasn't my fave style of pad thai, less tangy than I'm used to, but that's because I ordered it Malaysian satay-style, so that's my fault (it was still great, just not what I expected).  We'll definitely order from here again.  We did take out so we didn't have the chance to see any bad behaviour on management's part, so I can't weigh in on that point."}
{"text":"I was walking by Coconut Bay today and saw that they had a $6.99 take out special.  This is a pretty good deal, especially in Toronto.  So, I ordered Basil Tofu with vegetables.  Given the picture and the name, I assumed that this would be a Thai dish.  I am not sure if I was mistaken, but what I got basically had no tofu in it and a bunch of bok choy with a few pieces of cauliflower.  The plate tasted like Chinese food and was predominantly white rice.  I probably wouldn't go back considering there are many other better Thai options in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"So first I want to say that I ordered for delivery though that shouldn't matter. So the order was pineapple fried rice  yellow curry beef and spring rolls. The pineapple fried rice was bland (the worst I've ever had) it looks and taste like it was all boiled. The shrimp is just the frozen shrimp (and cheap at that)  even the pineapple is super bitter.  The spring rolls were luke warm at best. And the curry didn't come with rice(it usually does at other places) and it came with a large amount of tofu in very large chunks. Needless to say this was the worst food I've ever eaten and I will NEVER eat here again. I highly recommend everyone stay away"}
{"text":"What a horrible restaurant!   The old Asian waiter (owner?) is horrible!  He walks around chewing food, stands right beside you while you're looking at the menu and if not ready asks how many minutes you will need.  I was a total inconvenience to him!  The food is horrible!  The chicken spring rolls were frost bitten and soggy with no chicken and the basil chicken had more green peppers than basil!  Worst spring rolls ever anywhere!!!  Another crappy, temporary Toronto restaurant!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a chance because it's so close to my work so I've tried it three times since they have opened. The service is always friendly in my experiences but the food is seriously lacking. The first two dishes I had were fried rice I forget what kind but both times it was super bland and had no seasoning flavor. If you like eating fried rice that taste like white rich come here. Just ordered a green curry today cause they have this 6.95 all day deal so I thought I would give them one last shot. This curry taste like spicy water. Curry is suppose to be creamy thick and have a combination of flavors, this taste like they cut up a bunch of chilli papers and boiled them in water. Way too spicy and not enough cream or other flavors. Will not return, I gave you guys an honest shot and felt sorry for how slow you have been as I am a business owner myself, but seriously how can you start a restaurant with bad food."}
{"text":"Bought take out here and it is terrible cause there is an insect in the soup. This place is not recommended to go to. Not really a Thai restaurant and is a mix of Chinese food. The menu is terrible has very few items. Don't know what to say all I can say is not recommend to people's around the area."}
{"text":"I believe this is a new restaurant to the area. Came here on a Friday lunch with a few coworkers. The place got really busy, really quickly. So much so that the servers seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  The food was all priced at around $10 and they had lunch specials that came with a spring roll and soup for about the same price. After waiting 15 minutes, half of our tables food came out. We waited about another 10 minutes for the third dish to arrive, which was then taken away by the server (from right out under me) about 30 seconds later because he seemed to think it was the wrong order (turns out he had given me the full size rather than the lunch size). Not very professional or sanitary in my opinion. We then waited about another 10 minutes for our 4th lunch companion's food to arrive.   The food wasn't bad - I would go back for that - but I have hesitations about the service.  Aside from the debacle with getting our meals out, the man who seemed to be the owner or manager seemed to be quite rude to his younger waitstaff which was uncomfortable to watch. Furthermore, they should have been more prepared for a Friday lunch.   Bottom line: try at your own risk."}
{"text":"I noticed this place a while ago but hadn't tried it before today, when I stopped in for lunch. It's a clean and cozy little space and there were a few other tables occupied when I was there. I ordered General Tao chicken from a short list of lunch specials, and it appeared on my table less than two minutes later -- a reasonably portioned serving of chicken with a few nice chunks of vegetables, a pyramid of rice, and a spring roll. I assumed that the soup which was supposed to be included would follow.Â   I quickly discovered that the food was only lukewarm, so I asked the server to heat it up for me. She whisked it away with a brief apology and then I sat for what seemed like much longer than it should have taken before the dish was brought back to me, barely warmer than when it left. I gave up on the idea of a hot lunch and decided to eat it anyway, but first asked about the missing soup. \"We don't have soup today,\" I was told. It kind of boggled my mind that a restaurant that serves lunch specials that include soup could run out (especially since Thai soups are quick & easy to prepare), but as I overheard other tables ordering their lunch, it appeared that the restaurant didn't have many of the items on the menu.  Temperature aside, the food I got was nicely prepared and tasty. The General Tao chicken was one of the better renditions I've had, with crispy batter, a sauce that was nicely balanced and not goopy, and tender-crisp veggies. The rice was tasty, and the spring roll wasn't greasy.  When the cheque came, they hadn't provided any discount on the special to make up for the missing soup but it didn't seem worth making a fuss about. Overall, I'm not sure if I'll give them another chance to win my business."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food, sufficient ingredients used. Will definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've had the worst dining experience in my life there. Ordered fried dumplings, curry chicken, and tom yum soup, and I only had more than one bite for the dumplings and I'm guessing the owner bought the frozen ones in Chinatown. I'm hoping this restaurant will be soon closed for good."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the past 2 months, and I have not experienced what other reviewers have noted about the service. In my experience, the manager has been kind, respectful and very professional. The first time he asked us to sit while we waited for our takeout order, and while we waited, he gave us soup on the house. The 2nd time he added spring rolls to my soup order, and that was a nice surprise. In terms of the food. Some of the food has been great (e.g., soups, spring rolls, mango salad). Items that we were okay with, but not blown away with, were the noodles and ginger beef mains. Yet, we would return again and try other mains. Things to note - they have happy hour, a great lunch deal, and it is good value for money."}
{"text":"I ate here when it was newly open and may have eaten metal from the wok wire cleaning brush and had to go to emerg til 3 am. How could I not notice? It was dimly lit at night and I had the pad Thai with toasted coconut, so I kept thinking the crunchy bits were toasted coconut. But then I spit out a bit out and saw a small shimmery bit that was metal. It was all throughout the dish. It really could happen anywhere so watch what you eat!! The food was tasty enough though, so I hope they figured this out."}
{"text":"I had lunch there with my co-worker today.  We were all surprised how poor service they had.   The waiter rushed us to order food as soon as we took off our jackets.  When my co-worker wanted to keep a menu to look for other food items, the waiter was so impatience and then grabbed the menu from her hands.  When we had the checks, the waiter just put down the credit card machine at our table and then left. 6 of us had to punch in the check amount ourselves.    The food was nothing specially at all. The rice was uncooked.  The lemongrass chicken tastes like sweet and sour chicken.  Not sure if they know how to cook Thai food at all.   I will NOT recommend this thai restaurant to others."}
{"text":"I've never written any review on Yelp but this time I have to because I had a really awful experience and need to let others know about this place.  First thing first, I ordered green curry for take out but when I got home, I got pad Thai instead so I had to go all the way back to the restaurant which was really annoying especially cuz I was already very hungry and not only did the manager not apologize for that, he kinda insisted that I ordered pad Thai and making it seem to be my fault. No need to even mention his attitude.   For the food, it used to be 6.99 for lunch take out with veggie spring rolls and soup on the side, now the price has gone up to 7.45(?) if I recall, so $9 w tax and no more spring roll or soup. The portion is tiny, and it barely has any tofu in it if you go for the veggie option. they didn't even bother to chop  up the broccoli lol. I kinda laughed a little when I found this huge piece of broccoli. I know you get what you pay for but even for a cheap place like this, it is still overpriced. Now I know why it's always empty inside whenever I pass by.  Anyway, definitely not going back, very disappointing, terrible service, mediocre food, not really sanitary either."}
