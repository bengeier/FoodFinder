{"text":"Not sure where are these 5 stars are coming from. I just ordered the fried rice with bulgogi beef - terrible. If you've ever had real Korean BBQ this is far from it.

1. The egg.. where is it? I found one a sliver of a fried egg in the corner. No way it was a whole egg.
2. Bulgogi? This is not bulgogi. Maybe some chopped up flank steak? Portion was meh.
3. Kimchi?! the worst offense. Not even pretend kimchi. it's like shriveled pieces of iceberg lettuce soaked in unknown sauce.
4. The rice - well it tastes like rice.
5. Sprinkle some chopped green onion on top for decoration.
6. There were some other things listed but i can't really find them in here.

Never again. Had to cover in soy and Sriracha. Never. Again."}
{"text":"Tried this place at FoodStock. Started with just a sample had to come back for a real meal. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Very very slow service.  Food was okay at best.  There should be more meat on fries when they charge $10.00.  Will not be returning to this food truck EVER again."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. The menu and concept of the truck itself is so cool and unique. The Gogi beef is so flavorful and tender and the taco shells are perfectly crispy. Really enjoyed my lunch! Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Wow, I really wanted to love this food truck. I've been following them for awhile. Even liked their Facebook page. Sorta even a fan of their story :-( . I hate giving a bad review but I wished I had read the most recent reviews posted. I guess the 5 star ratings I saw were from 3-4 reviews. 

I was so excited I walk up and tell the owner guy with the Mohawk that I've been following them for awhile. I asked what was their most authentic Korean dish he would recommend. Saying I'm 1/2 Korean and love Korean food.  Also I don't like Mexican food ( all taco meals). 
He says in a condensing way I don't know what you mean about not liking Mexican. He says in a very aggressive way he's the most popular food truck in Phoenix. ( Note I'm the ONLY person there in line) He says \"Gotta make the food sexy.\" Blah, blah ok just answer the question.  I ask again. He said probably the kimchi. Then he asks have you had kimchi before? I say I'm half Korean and said I like Korean food. He goes on a rant about being half polish blah,blah. How I'm not going to get authentic Korean food on a food truck anywhere. Blah, blah Btw I have in many cities.  I just want the most authentic even if it's a little authentic. At this point I want to walk away but I'm on a mission to try the food so again I ask for a recommendation. He finally recommends the chicken and rice. I ordered it along with the kimchi. Asking for none of the mayo sauce.  
I hurry home to eat. 

Food review- the chicken was diced into little cubes. It was dry and over cooked. The dish consisted of over cooked white rice and purple cabbage. Also had the sauce that I asked to take off. I get it that's it's not authentic Korean food but it's not even good \"sexy\" food.  He did warn me the kimchi was a little different than the traditional kimchi so thank you. Thats  all I ask tell me about the food in a non condensing way. It was ok (Kim chi) not a fan and pretty pricey for $3. See pictures. 
All in all a big disappointment. If this is how you treat your fans .....All in all a bad experience."}
{"text":"Super friendly chef and exquisite food! I had the fried rice with chicken and the fries. Both were great, but the fries were to die for! Really hope she comes back to our corporate office. I rarely eat at food trucks (as most are pretty terrible), but I'm glad I ate here. She's on a whole other level!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this food truck doesn't have higher reviews?! Hibachibot came to my work for a food truck meet up and was some of the best Korean bbq I've had in the valley since moving here 3 years ago. Their Korean Mexican fusion reminds me of a highly rated food truck back in the Bay Area. The Korean beef was a little bit dry but the flavor was on point! My fianc√© had the tacos which he really enjoyed but he also kept devouring my mexorean fries. Definitely check it out, it was SO good!"}
{"text":"Dad's famous tacos are bomb!!!!  Delicious food and awesome customer service! Love love love this truck!"}
{"text":"I love this little truck -the Gogi beef tacos are a unique and flavorful treat.  I stop by once or twice a week. There's not a lot of affordable lunch places in Carefree;
 this is and its delicious - quick but freshly prepared by really delightful folks."}
{"text":"Hibachibot Korean BBQ Food Truck is a fun looking food truck that serves Korean Fusion style foods. The fun looking food truck and interactive robot sort of drew me to this food truck. I also have an interest in Korean Style food so I thought this would be a good choice. I'll start with that I am not an expert of Korean Cuisine but nothing I tried seemed the least bit Korean Tasting. Just because the food has a squirt of Sriracha Mayo on it doesn't make it Korean Food to me.

I tried half of the Taco Trio. They were medium sized tacos....bigger than street tacos but not full size tacos. The taco trio was suppose to contain a marinated steak, chicken and ground beef tacos. The best and the most flavorful of the three was the steak taco. This was the only taco that tasted like the meat was marinated. Techniquely ALL THE TACOS HAD PROBLEMS. The steak was cooked till it was crisp....like bacon and was chewy..and crunchy.The chicken was dry and flavorless as well as the ground beef. A small cup of some sort of red sauce was included but it taste like sweetened canned tomatoes. I have no idea what it was suppose to be. I could eat the food because I was starving at the time but I would pass this one by next time."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Korean food, so when I saw them at my work I was really excited! Unfortunately, the moment I opened my box, I was let down.  I paid $15 for the #2 (2 gogi tacos, 2 bot balls(fried rice balls), and 2 fried yakis(wontons)).  Everything looked like miniature versions of what they're supposed to be, which normally wouldn't have been a big deal if the flavors were on point.  Sadly, they missed the mark on that too. The tacos had more cabbage than meat, and the little bit of meat that was there, was dry and bland.  The bot balls were smaller than a golf ball and had none of the kimchi kick that was promised and the sweet and spicy gochujang tasted like straight up honey.  And don't even get me started on the fried yakis; They were greasy pockets of bland mush.   I can't help but wonder if they're concerned about their customer's sodium intake because they seem to avoid salt like the plague!  Overall, the food was about as satisfying as a $15 glass of tepid water."}
{"text":"I LOVE korean food and I was so excited to try this food truck. I wouldn't say that the food was bad, but I wouldn't repeat. I had the kimchi rice and I was very dissapointed by the kimchi. It was more like white rice, fresh cabbage, scallions and sriracha. The cabbage/kimchi wasn't even pickled! The texture of the rice was ok, in some parts it was a little overcooked, but there was NO egg at all in my portion. The egg is the protein and the best part! Egg usually soaks in the flavor and makes the carbs worthwhile. Plus eggs are crazy cheap! The service was really very good though (hence the extra star). I think they gotta work on their fried rice. Even the frozen kimchi rice from trader joe's tastes more better ;)"}
{"text":"What a great idea and cool food truck! I tried to keep an open mind and not have any expectations of taste and quality. I ordered just a side of rice and (\"spicy\") kimchi. The rice definitely needs to be perfected - crunchy :-/ And the \"spicy\" kimchi had no flavor whatsoever. Like none. I'm glad I decided against something else - I feel like it would've tasted blan."}
{"text":"I sauntered down to Phoestivus determined not to buy anything, it's the holidays and I need to save money.

But I felt the siren's call after a beer and wandered through the food truck line. I wasn't feel very cultured that day, and nothing appeals more to that mood than carne asada fries.

But if you make that carne bulgogi? I'm in heaven.

The size was more than fair, plenty of delicious meats and cheese. The guac and sour cream came out of a bottle but it was still a nice change of pace from all the meats and fat."}
{"text":"Great service. Huge servings! First timer and I'm hooked! I got the Gogi rice bowl...beef. With a side of Bot Balls and some egg roll things. Everything was so full of flavor and absolutely delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"We books this food truck for one of our large events and asked for pre-paid, pre-made samples. We signed a contract stating when and where we would pay. On the day of the event they cancelled leaving us in a lurch. We were short on food and short on trucks. This caused the other food trucks to have long lines (but great profit for them). I had had this truck before at another food truck event. Even though they were slow, I thought the food was good enough to recommend to my organization. Big mistake. Would not recommend using this food truck for events."}
{"text":"Tried them at food truck Friday. It was yummy my partner and I got the rice bowl and tacos. Definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Get the tacos! Get the tacos! I'm serious get the tacos. So glad the kids picked food truck Friday with the original inner fat kid. We ate at so many trucks not a bad choice in the mix. These tacos where delicious. Tried one of everything. So many flavors that compliment each other perfectly. When you take two kids who are afraid to try anything and you get them to eat three new things your in the right place. The medium kid thought the tacos were too spicy but the mild kids said she's crazy. These tacos are spiced and season perfectly if the mild kid says so they truly are. Loved the tacos went back for seconds. Need to stick with one taco next time cause you will get mad at yourself for not getting more of which ever one you like best. My inner fat kid taught me long ago why choose. Can't wait to come back.  Great value for your buck."}
{"text":"Im a concierge and a foodie. I send everyone here! The beef gogi tacos will blow your mind. Unbelievable good. The food truck is stationed in a cool robot art studio with amaging food and art talent."}
{"text":"Went down to food truck Friday west mainly because I saw this truck was going to be there and I've been wanting to try it for awhile.  I honestly thought the food was pretty good.  Given, I am no Korean food expert but the flavors were tasty.  The bot balls were my least favorite.  I was very excited about them, I love anything fried and rice balls are usually awesome.  They had no flavor.  Thankfully the dipping sauce made up for it but it was so thin it ran right off the ball and made a mess.  
I docked a star for the price.  With tip I paid $17 for a meal that consisted of a rice bowl, 2 bot balls, 1/3 cup kimchi and a can of soda.
It was fun to try and maybe if I'm seriously craving I'll return but next time I'll try something else."}
{"text":"Thank heavens for food trucks right?! Every week my work has a different food truck come to feed us and a few times Hibachibot has come. Let me tell you they do not disappoint! Great menu and yummy tacos. Highly recommend stopping to check them out if you see them around the valley."}
{"text":"This food truck manage to nab a stop at the Capitol last Friday during lunch time.  I and my friend both ordered the Beef Gogi Rice Bowl  and we were was pleasantly surprised how delicious it was.  The beef was tendered, a tad sweet for my taste, the sriracha mayo offered a little heat, and the daikon red cabbage was crunchy and not watery.  Rice was even more delicious when I mixed the cabbage and mayo into it.  My only surprise that it was in a boat style open container which had my friend and I putting napkins on top to walk back to our office since we didn't want bugs in the food.  I hope they're able to come back to the Capitol so I can try the other items on their menu"}
{"text":"I was super excited at the thought of another Asian food truck since most of them have been a letdown. Unfortunately, another one bites the dust and this truck is doomed if they don't revamp soon.

The giant robot is what caught my attention in the parking lot, so whoever designed their truck knew what they were doing. I ordered the bulgogi, but I sensed some trouble when I said 'Can I get the bulgogi?' and the guy repeated 'The beef?\" and I replied back, \"Yes, the bulgogi\" to which he asked, \"So, the beef?\" I should have slowly backed up and disappeared behind the parked cars or burrowed myself in the hedges at this point, but I really wanted to give it a shot.

There's only one person working in the truck so orders definitely come out at a slower pace but they have a portable mister which definitely helped in this hellish weather. When I finally got my bulgogi, I looked at the meat and all I could think was that these square bits were too small and too stiff to be bulgogi. To be honest, from the looks of the meat, it was so flat and stiff and oddly cut that it looked like the beef treats I give my whale of a dog. The taste wasn't like soft, sweet bulgogi. Instead, it reminded me somewhat of a dry, leathery Chinese beef jerky, just shaved thinly. 

I tried their fried yakis and the meat filling was actually pretty good and moist. The price though is insane at essentially a dollar a piece and I popped these bad boys in my mouth like it was a mint so you won't be close to full on just those. 

There was plenty of rice in comparison though so you are essentially just paying for that. They have a pretty limited menu and it's not very cohesive. There's a random french fry dish where they load it with  other condiments and toppings and another dish with ground beef but I have no idea how that's related to Korean food at all. Not even close to being a fusion item either. Like other reviews, I have no idea how this place is getting 5 stars but maybe my spidey senses tell me that having just 1 review written is the most obvious answer."}
{"text":"UPDATE 03/01/018 

So today I ordered the Rice bowl again with Chicken and added the Gogi Beef for $1 more. This rice bowl is amazing, Im on a low carb thing but to hell with it today  Honestly I  was craving a rice bowl on Wednesday and gave in and went to Samurai Sams, saying ill just skip Hibachibot when comes to the office on Thursday.  Hands down Hibachibot kills Samurai Sam's rice bowl for flavor and price point. Good thing this food truck comes every other month Or else my carbs would take over. This rice bowl is good food!!!"}
