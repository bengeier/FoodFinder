{"text":"I was really excited to support a new local pizza place AND they offer cheese calzones! My favorite!! Unfortunately the food wasn't great. We had a medium pepperoni pizza and a cheese calzone carry out. The first disappointment was when I saw sauce peaking out of the calzone. My family is from Long Island,NY. I have had many amazing cheese calzones in my life. None have sauce inside.  The dough was browned but didn't have any crisp to it and the little bit of ricotta inside was dry and grainy. The pizza dough seemed undercooked. No crispness even in the crust. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the sauce is really tasty and they were generous with the toppings. I really wanted to love you Papa Rosa's! But for me there are too many other delicious local pizza joints."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey BUT well worth it. My family loves to try new pizza places and this is our favorite so far. Lots of cheese but not too much sauce. Thats ok with us because thats how we like it but some people might not be crazy about that. All the workers were very friendly and delivery was fast. Food was hot when it got here. All around good experience"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try Papa Rosa's pizza again.   We'll sort of.... When I heard the former owner of Marc Anthony Pizza (from my high school days) of Bedford opened a new place in Cuyahoga Falls, I had to try it.  I was happy I did.   Yummy crust, sauce and topped just right.  Can't wait to have an excuse to be in Cuyahoga Falls area to pick up another pizza pie!   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After driving by Papa Rosa's a few times I decided to give it a try. I ordered a large peperoni pizza for carry out. The order took 25 minutes, and cost $14.75. The pizza was delicious. There was lots of quality peperoni and cheese.  The sauce was also good, but if you like a lot on your pizza you might want to request extra. The crust was also exceptional. It has more flavor than most pizzas. It also is one of those softer in the middle, crunchy on the edge type. This is one of those pizzas you can fold in half and enjoy. It reminds me more of an old school pizza. I have tried a lot of pizza shops in the area (most of them overrated imo), and this is the best. I have returned a few times since my initial order and their pizza is always great."}
{"text":"I really want this business to succeed. I don't personally like chain restaurants much. And dislike Pizza chains even more so. 
I'm only putting this review on here that it might help them grow a little bit. 
I didn't like the dough. To me they didn't allow the gluten to fully develop. Dunno what kind of yeast they are using ??? Might change that a bit. 
Rewarming it after I got home from work, the dough was very soft and the cheese was mushy. Again..... I don't know what kind of cheese you are using. Who is your supplier?? You might want to check out Chip from USFoods. He's a gem and will help you out immensely
. My business didn't succeed because I didnt have the money to back it--- not because of the food. I made everytg from scratch. And I see you all are doing that as well. 
So please don't take this in anyway but me trying to help. The pepperoni was delightful. And the presentation was fabulous. 
Take it as you will..... We have have growing pains when starting a new business. :))"}
{"text":"Loved Papa Rosa's! We stopped here on a whim for take out. Ordered a large pizza, wings, and garlic bread. The pizza was great and so was the garlic bread. Wings were ok...we got the garlic flavor that ended up being more oil than garlic, but I would go back and would also try another flavor! The pizza had a great crust - crunchy yet thick and sort of soft in the center. Sauce was flavorful yet a little sweet. I loved it!

Bonus is that they're locally owned, friendly and with a sheep clean kitchen! Always a plus! Our new family pizza place!"}
{"text":"I preface this review by saying I'm the pickiest pizza critic on the planet...

The pizza is pretty amazing!  Crust is great, sauce has a sweet taste, which is a great balance for your saltier toppings. 

We ordered one meatball and one pepperoni, both were very good!  The meatball was flavored beautifully and sliced nice and thin, cooked perfectly!

Do yourself a favor and give it a try...it's definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"I have to say this is amazing pizza! The staff has been so nice every time we order as well. I am pretty picky and feel this is one of three places I will only order from. Perfect."}
