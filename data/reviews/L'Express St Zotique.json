{"text":"These sandwiches are HUGE so make sure to bring a friend to share one or get half packed up to take home. They are also delicious. And the staff is ultra friendly. I thought it was a little overpriced at first until I saw the size of our sandwiches. I highly recommend the salmon tartare sandwich and the goat cheese/grilled veg on brioche. Yum."}
{"text":"Great salads, sandwiches, and service. Highly recommend coming here for a quick, healthy and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Amazing and VERY TASTY food, big portions, very good service, I really loved the place, it is NOT TO BE MISSED!"}
{"text":"La selection de produits est plus proche de l'epicerie fine que du dépanneur typique. On y trouve aussi une sélection de charcuterie et de fromage.  Mais l'attraction principale, c'est le bar à sandwiches et salades à emporter ou consommer sur place -- il y a quelques tables confortables installées dans l'angle le plus lumineux du magasin.  Le sandwich demi-baguette à la salade de thon est un délice très copieux. L'agneau est également un incontournable, me dit-on, et je le crois volontiers.   Le personnel est amical et de bonne humeur, les lieux sont propres. Bonne vibration. Je recommande sans réserve pour le lunch."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've cared about sandwiches, but this place has got me seriously excited about them. So far, I've only had the salmon tartare one and the coriander beef one they make on Fridays, but both were spectacular: great combinations of great ingredients on lovely fresh bread. I haven't tried the soups or salads, and don't have much interest in the type of groceries they offer, but the sandwiches are really impressive so far."}
{"text":"Sorry no good. I had the  mushroom soup with truffles oil + pulled pork sandwich + cookie + juice: 20$  Did not finish... They should step up their game... Restaurant looks good and staff is nice, but could not eat the food."}
{"text":"Yes, yes--I know Montreal is famous for its ubiquitous poutine, but I was just craving a salad on my visit!  L'Express St Zotique was just what I craved: a thoughtful and diverse selection of salads, sandwiches and soups with homemade dressings in a clean and pleasant interior. As a nice bonus service was friendly in both English and French and prices are reasonable for Montreal. They appear to have a lovely selection of juices and iced teas as well."}
{"text":"Acceuil souriant, des sandwiches succulants , recettes fancies, salades, café , thés , jus etc, joliment fenestré."}
