{"text":"Was expecting a pleasant experience based on the 5star review on yelp. Turned out to be a big disappointment, the vegetable pakoras were dry and no flavor the lamb pieces in the curry were tough not tender and the curry it self was good but not something I would return for. On to the next restaurant."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!  Service and food.  A hidden gem"}
{"text":"I was initially hesitant to order since I've been a loyal customer to another Indian restaurant in town. I ordered  a cauliflower and potato dish, as well as the yellow dal, naan, pakoras and mint chutney. The food was delicious and I will definitely order for this spot again. I ordered takeout - my food was ready at the time promised and still hot when I got it home. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"I don't know how the chef does it, but he packs an incredible range of complementary flavors into every dish. That's what I expect from a great Indian restaurant. If you appreciate Indian cuisine, this is the best kept secret in Calgary.  Try the lamb curry, Ali Ghobi, and the mixed vegetables which are tossed in masala."}
{"text":"It was a surprise discovery on this side of the planet. Visiting Calgary from India and finding an authentic Goat Curry and absolutely spot on Biryani was a big satisfaction for my palate. Nan and Tandoori Roti with Dal Makhani was very yummy. Not very spicy. Indian Food, tasted just like home cooked food and was away from Pakistani or Bangladeshi Indian Food, found everywhere in the west, in the garb of Indian Cuisine. My two visits there did not disappoint me. I wish they grow more and add more serving staff. All the Best Monica."}
{"text":"I did a take away from this place and the food was good. We ate yellow daal tadka, Tandoori roti and Biryani.. and everything was freshly prepared. The restaurant owner was friendly when I went to take my order. Recommend this place if you're looking for good indian food in Calgary downtown area."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends and was blown away how good it was. Restaurant was super quiet (we were the only table) but the hostess was amazing.  Friendly, efficient and gracious. We had 4 dishes to share with coconut rice and Naan. And all 4 dishes were amazing. We will be back for certain."}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced relative to portions. Friendly and warm staff. Food quality was decent. But there are other options I may go for when in Calgary. Visited early March2017"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved away from Calgary and needed a place to host a dinner for ~18 of our good friends. The owners of this place kindly accommodated our large group by hosting a buffet on a Saturday night. This worked out PERFECTLY. People could eat at their own pace, arrive in a staggered way, and feel control and happiness as a result. Personally I really dislike sitting around waiting for EVERYONE to decide on an entr√©e - especially when I'm really hungry. The selection the buffet offered was diverse and catered to vegetarians and meat eaters alike. The service was also very attentive and I highly recommend this place. It used to be called Surya, under it's last ownership. Namaste!"}
{"text":"Had been to this for a weekday buffet. This is the first time we ate Indian food in downtown Calgary. Not impressed at all. Not enough dishes. The buffet menu is not well put together. Not much taste to talk about. We ate Indian food at Banff , it was much better there."}
{"text":"Last minute amazing Yelp find on our way to the airport. Buffet was exceptional. Large meat portions. Good quality. Fresh Naan. Even delivered some freshly cooked shrimp and chicken tikka to our table. Great service! Will keep on our list of places to return to on our next trip to Calgary!"}
{"text":"Best north India food in town. It's a hidden gem and not a lot of people know about it. The service was also very good. We had Bertha, makhani, malai tikka, tandoori, biryani and everything was delicious the lemonade was also to die for Well done and keep up the good work"}
{"text":"This restaurant's northeastern style food is quite good but the kitchen tends to be inconsistent, even after talking directly to the owner/chef. But if able, I'd rate it 3.5 stars.  We greatly enjoyed the two main dishes we ordered the first time: Kadhai lamb and chicken jalfrezi, with regular basmati rice and garlic naan bread. The mains tasted very differently, and yet were quite good together. For sure the flavours were great, and were worth ordering again after trying out more of their selection.  What you might want to know is that punjab, tamil and northeastern Indian food are vastly different re. use of spices and cooking styles. Going to this restaurant will hit a third regional style quite well. The yellow-tinged garlic naan was quite different from any I've had before, and the 2nd order with double the garlic, was crispy, light and so good.  We returned a couple times more, but the flavours didn't hold up, and so we've stopped going. We can more consistently get better at Raj Palace and elsewhere even as far away as Mehtab in Cochrane, and so must let our feet do the talking."}
{"text":"Lately, I've been obsessed with Skip the Dishes, and this restaurant was listed as a local option. As many previous reviewers have stated, I had walked past this place several times before I finally ordered from them. I ordered everything to go through Skip the Dishes and picked up my food. The portions are generous, and I loved all of the flavors! The chicken tika misala was delicious, and the only downside was that I finished it too quickly! This is a great place if you want a date night with your special someone, or if you had a large group, this place would accommodate. The owners greeted me as soon as I walked through the door, and I look forward to continue giving this place my business."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! I think this is the best Indian food I have had. Service was great, prices very reasonable (and good portions for it). The building it's in seems to be a tough location though as it's not too obvious from the street."}
{"text":"Masala Mantra was our first stop in Calgary! One of the best Indian restaurants I've found as a traveler. Amazing flavors,(got the lamb vinadaloo &veggie samosas)also great ambience and great service."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a few times. Admittedly, I wasn't sure what the sign actually said because the font's a little hard to read, but it definitely smells great. Today though, I was hungry and the waft of Indian food on my walk home was too good to pass up.  I had the butter chicken with garlic naan and coconut rice (and of course a King Fisher beer to wash the day away). The food was excellent and I now have two favourite Indian-style restaurants to go to in Calgary. The best part -- this one's right around the corner from my place.  I got the impression that it's a small, family-run business, which I'm a big fan of in a place like Calgary; I like supporting smaller, authentic and unique restaurants over the big chains. If that's your style too, you'll love this place.  Price was mid-rage. For a beer, rice, naan, and butter chicken, it was $30 and I had leftovers *thumbs up*  The service was excellent; the owners are very kind and I'm looking forward to my next visit.  If you're a fan of Indian food -- you should go here  :)"}
{"text":"We went with a group of 6 on Saturday night to try this place. We were skeptical at first since we were the only ones there initially, however we were thoroughly impressed by the food. Every dish we ordered was amazing and the price was reasonable as well. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  We've always enjoyed Moti Mahal, but this place takes it up a notch.  So personable and the food is amazing.   I hope they stick around."}
{"text":"Having the lunch buffet as I write. Nice selection, I got to try a few new dishes. Spice levels were very low which is a bit disappointing. Overall nice flavours though. I would come again"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal, wait staff was pleasantly accommodating and music was just perfect. We first had veggie samosas, then cheese naan, then lamb vindaloo with basmati rice. All was so tasty and definitely would recommend if you're stopping through Calgary for the day!"}
{"text":"Got delivery yesterday and big improvement over my lunch experience. Chicken kadai, baigan bartha and garlic naan. Bartha was very good- it's not an appetizing looking dish since it's mostly eggplant pulp but it's very tasty. Kadai was a bit strange- was expecting a creamy sauce as Green Chili does it but this was oddly jelly like, but flavour was decent. The naan was delicious but not what I expected- two small disks that were dense like a lacha paratha or green onion cake but VERY tasty, could order this every time.  And unlike my lunch experience, the curries were both very spicy.  All in with tip and delivery charge (skip the dishes) was around $40 but I barely made a dent- this is plenty for three people."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a lot and noticed the weird font in their sign and finally decided to try it. It is across the street from the Co-op. We ordered take out from here and I must say I was surprised at how good it was even after the food sat in their containers for quite a while! We had the eggplant bharta and palak paneer along with regular naan. The eggplant bharta had a very nice flavour that wasn't only tomato. The palak paneer was also very tasty and even though I don't like paneer, the palak part of it was really delicious. I actually think the two dishes balanced each other out and would definitely recommend them together! The naan was pretty good but I don't think it was the best naan I've ever had, although it did sit in tin foil for a while. The owners were also super friendly! I'm glad to have found awesome Indian food so close to home. I would definitely recommend this place over Tandoori Grill & Spices if you're in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Awesome service. Loved the chicken tikka masala - very flavourful, tender and moist chicken."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped into Masala Mantra tonight after moving in across the street. We chose to stick with some Indian staple dishes including: butter chicken, mixed vegetables, garlic naan, and coconut rice. Our meal was hands down the best Indian I've had in the city. We also ordered the house lemonade which was pleasantly spicy and very unique. To top off an already amazing meal our server, Monica, was extremely friendly and attentive taking the time to not only learn our names but ask in detail how we enjoyed our experience. I would highly recommend Masala Mantra to anyone looking for some delicious Indian and kick ass service."}
{"text":"As an English man in the USA one of the few things I Miss is a good Indian,  luckily I get to travel to Calgary to visit this place.  Service was first class and food was even better.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I had the buffet lunch here last week and everything was amazing and very fresh (unlike many buffets).  Garlic naan is to die for!  Will be back for sure."}
