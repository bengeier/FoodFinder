{"text":"This place is great! A welcome addition to our Monona neighborhood.  I stopped in for lunch at about 12:45 on Friday. They have a small menu, but everything looks good and is priced extremely reasonably. There are three small tables that fit 4 chairs each, and several stools for counter seating. The restaurant is clean and the owner is extremely friendly and welcoming. I was greeted right when I entered, and within about a minute, he offered me a taste of the spanakopita.  I ended up ordering some spanakopita to go, as well as a Greek salad with Greek vinaigrette. My food was ready in about 3-4 minutes, and my total cost was $7.50. Great! The spanakopita was delicious; flaky pastry, good feta, and well-balanced ingredients overall. The salad was awesome and large; it contained lettuce, tomato, red onion, feta, and green olives. And there was no skimping on ingredients - plenty of everything.   I will absolutely return to It's All Greek - looking forward to trying the gyros and baklava next time!"}
{"text":"Oh Goodness Me!  The gyro/s was amazing, fresh and tasty tomato and the sauce...the sauce.  The sauce has to be homemade, because the tangy twist it has just screams homemade.  Friendly owner, family-learned cook and knows what he is doing.  I'm scared to open the pastitios (sp),  because the speed at which I ate my gyros was like a food blackout.  It was a tasty blur from start to finish.  Don't let the ambiance turn you away, not everyone gets investors and can pour tons of money into the furniture.  I would rather have the focus be on the food, the money will come.  My parting words as I took my food home with me were, \"I'm sure I'll be back, this smells amazing\"  My final verdict is that, I most certainly will be back.  Thank you and Welcome to Monona."}
{"text":"So, we've been anxiously awaiting the opening of this place.  Signs in window prior to opening say \"all organic\", and we are thrilled to have a Greek restaurant in our neighborhood again!  So, we walk in last night for dinner, and see a sign saying \"Cash Only!\".  Hubby ran down the street to ATM & got cash.  While I was waiting for him, I see one of the employees walking thru the parking lot carrying a covered hotel tray.  Looked like he was coming from another restaurant just down the way, or maybe from an apartment.  I immediately thought \"uh oh\".   I then see TWO different couples walk out without food (they don't have tables, just a couple of counter seats).  I think \"Oh crap\".  We walk back in, and see the \"Kitchen\".  Uh. OK. Two electric griddles behind the counter.  A women is peeling strips of store bought gyro meat off a stack, and placing them on the griddle.  You know the ones I'm talking about if you've ever foolishly bought the frozen gyro kit in the supermarket.   That was that.  I turn to hubby, and say \"We're out of here!  If I want that crap, I'll go buy it in the damn grocery store!!\"  Totally disappointed.  Unless you don't care about eating pre-formed & sliced crap, heated up on a griddle, don't even bother walking in here."}
