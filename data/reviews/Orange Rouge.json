{"text":"Fantastic food, amazing drinks, phenomenal service.  On day 5 of our honeymoon and this by far has been our favorite spot. We got the special of the day (duck dumplings), pork ribs and fried rice. Each was amazing and complemented one another but the pork ribs are probably the best I've ever had. Get some. The plates are meant for sharing but by no means small. Something in between a regular portion and tapas.  The ambiance is hip and comfortable. The service is super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice: once in the winter with just one other person and once just recently with a large group. It's not the place for unadventurous eaters. Both meals were full of surprising but unequivocally delicious flavors. The plating of both entrees and main dishes was frequently beautiful and the balance of spices perfect. Even the desserts were luscious. Something truly different from Montreal's excellent but predictable French/Quebecois cuisine.   Full bar, warm ambiance, excellent service."}
{"text":"Bouffe excellente. Étant un groupe on a tout essayé et partagé et tous ont apprécié  Ambiance vraiment cool, service sympathique et bouffe excellente. Déjà hâte d'y retourner"}
{"text":"It's in chinatown, but not a chinese restaurant... per se.  My friend took me here for my birthday, she had heard about it, told me it was a new asian fusion place. The place looks very trendy, and the bathrooms are clean, definitely not a chinese restaurant lol.  I found the menu to be limited. It's mostly a drinking menu with some food options. Come to think of it, yeah I would come back for a drink, to eat not so much. The place is full of ambiance but the food is lacking.  I don't know what to say about this place, asian dish done western style? by the way that's code for watered down and plated nicely.  The popcorn chicken we ordered were very nice, crispy and tender. It was a nice appetizer.  The nappa cabbage confit, were sprinkled with salt and fried onions. This too was a very nice dish, although once you ate through the first layer, the rest of the cabbage was bland since they only salted the top.  The Hoi tod (which is a mussel crispy pan cake from thailand) was puny and not crispy. This was a total miss, I understand they were putting a spin on it but, it lacked all the elements that made a hoi tod good. Anytime you have something eggy and soggy instead of crispy that's a miss.  The beef short ribs, looked good, but they were not fall off the bone, and too salty.  The eggplant although it looked well seasoned with some dark sauce, turned out bland.  The mapo tofu was also bland.   The three things I liked most were the popcorn shrimps, the crispy chicken skins, and the orange ice cream. the chicken skins were super crispy and tasted awesome.  For dessert we ordered orange ice cream, and the waitress insisted we order a sweet xiaolong bao, a sweet dumpling. Just from the description I thought it was weird but we just went with it since she kept suggesting.  The dumpling was a bit weird, a sweet filling inside a dumpling is like eating rice with chocolate sauce... not good. You will never see this in a real chinese restaurant, it's just not done, not because people haven't thought of it but because the dumpling texture is just not right with something sweet, it's just mushy and sweet, one note, no symphony here.  The ice cream was another story, it had very nice orange flavor and not tangy at all. Beneath the ice cream there were some caramelized ginger slivers which added another dimension. It was nice and refreshing, perfect.  Not exactly east meets west, more lost at sea and adrift in confusion..."}
{"text":"Really surprised this place isn't the hippest place in Montreal, with a line out the door.  The food was great, the service was great, and the atmosphere was great.  Everyone there was extremely accommodating of the fussy vegetarians in my party, and went out of there way, even making not-on-menu items for them.  Ask for hot sauce, and you'll receive a delicious creamy sriracha type sauce.  Some of the prices were a little high for what we got, but overall a great place."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good terrasse, staff friendly,attentive and easy going. Had the foie gras steambuns, terrific! Balanced, taste explosion."}
{"text":"Resto was amazing. Some of the best food I had in a very long time. Actually a really fun evening. It had been a while since I laughed like that . I highly recommend the restaurant.  Simon V."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely has something going for it, although they might need to iron out a few kinks (as do most new restaurants). We arrived at 8:15PM on a Saturday night and managed to snag the last table.   We ordered the Blanchailles Frites & Arachides Sriracha, which were great to snack on. Would go perfect with a beer, but we opted for a cocktail (Old Royal Jelly - A Old Fashioned style cocktail, and a Golden Slumber - very refreshing, almost mojito like).   We then had the BBQ Pork, which was perfectly cooked. Moist and a fatty belly, the oyster emulsion was also great. Also had the aubergines. This dish was good, but nothing to write home about. Also the aubergines really need a knife to cut through, something that should have been provided to accompany the chopsticks. We switched to the Barbaresco from Langhe for this course, which was a good balance for the BBQ Pork & also didn't overpower the fish.   Next up was the Omble Chevalier. This was served in three ways. 1) Sashimi; 2) Poached; 3) Grilled. The sashimi and the grilled filet were excellent. Simple & clean flavours. I'm not normally a big fan of poached fish, and this one didn't wow me either. However, given my aversion to poached, I'll still give this dish a thumbs up.   Desert was the Xiao Long Bao. A nice take on the original. Points for creativity, but I think it was a bit confused. The table next to us had the orange ice cream, and were raving about it, so I will try that next time.   Overall: As I mentioned earlier, they have a few kinks to work out service wise. The waiter needed to be reminded about our wine, and had a bit of trouble opening it in the cramped tables. Also had some trouble pronouncing Okinomiyaki (which I know is a mouthful, but should be known by the staff). I'm also kinda comparing it to Cafe Sardine, which had impeccable service.   I will return here soon & hope that all the opening jitters have been settled. I definitely enjoyed the style of food, decor and atmosphere. I look forward to good things from here."}
{"text":"Un nouveau né dans le chinatown tenu par l'ancien chef du Café Sardine.   Je m'attendais à être frappée par quelque chose de particulier en entrant, mais non. Tout ce qu'il y a de plus resto chinois: tables, chaises et banquettes noires. Décor hyper épuré et menu en papier.   Une belle sélection de breuvages: saké et vins en différents formats, thés, jus, etc.  Pour ce qui est des plats on retrouve des classiques chinois comme le brocoli et steak, mais aussi quelques surprises comme la salade de tataki de boeuf qui est délicieuse et toute en texture ou le jarret de porc effiloché dans une sauce au goût asiatique avec riz, légume et oeuf coulant.   Les portions sont assez copieuses et sont prêt en un temps records.   La crème glacée à l'orange est impressionnante.   J'ai bien aimé. C'est parfait pour un dîner ou un souper pas cher, rapide et copieux. Une bonne place pour manger des mets chinois savoureux et tout en texture sans la lourdeur grasse de l'huile qu'on retrouve habituellement dans ce type de cuisine."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Blown away by the quality, attention to detail and attentive staff. Humble head chef. Could not have made the food or experience any better. This is by far one of the best gastronomic experiences we've had in Montreal."}
{"text":"I found this place as a recommendation on Google and was pleasantly surprised.   It's an Asian fusion restaurant with a hipster ambience located in Chinatown. We were greeted by a kind hostess who took our coats for us and we're promptly seated. Our waitress explained the menu to us (it's a sharing menu, approx. 1.5-2 dishes per person).   I had the Orange Rouge cocktail, which was okay, probably wouldn't order it again. Boyfriend had a drought beer.   We had a popcorn shrimp app to start with their house spicy sauce, which is phenomenal. Then we had the dumplings with duck confit which were fantastic. The duck was excellent. Then we had the sautéed squid which was served in a fried noodle bowl. Don't think I've had better squid in my life, I'd come back just for that. Then we had the steamed buns with foie gras, which were okay, but I don't think the flavours meshed well together.  Overall had a good experience, albeit a slightly expensive experience. Each dish is around $15-19 and they're fairly small portions."}
{"text":"While it was a little jarring to find that my husband and I were the only Asians in the restaurant on a busy Saturday night this helped set the expectations that we will not be getting anything close to authentic asian. Which is just fine actually. I was very impressed with the creative interpretations of each dish. We especially loved the foie gras steamed buns. The buns were well proportioned, the two sides crispy reminiscent of some of the best pan fried buns I've ever had. Great service and equally great cocktails. Just a very great night out with very little to complain about. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to see someone pushing the envelope and creating new styles of Asian cuisine in Chinatown. I found the dishes good, really enjoyed the ribs. The staff were very polite and made sure we were well looked after."}
{"text":"I recently read a raving review about this place on http://cultmontreal.com/2013/11/orange-rouge/ and so I thought I should give it a shot.  Well, seems like the reviewers either had a cold or had been distracted from the food by other means... our experience certainly couldn't live up to our expectations.    We got there shortly before 6pm on a friday and the place was already filling up. Interiors are nice, Service is friendly although still lacking of a good routine (that's ok, the place just opened).  We were told the dishes are inspired by the asian surroundings of the neighbourhood (Chinatown) and are meant to be shared on the table (tapas-style). Ok, so we ordered BBQ pork with oyster emulsion, braised Napa cabbage, roasted beef with veg, sauté of squid and courgette (13$), and finally, \"crevettes popcorn\", deep-fried shrimp in batter.   Beef ($15) and pork ($13) were ok, although the pork was a little dry. The cabbage ($8) was terrible since it was literally swimming in oil and came in full-sized leaves, impossible to eat with chopsticks (they offered a knife once we were finished). Besides, it had some bad off-flavours from unburnt gas. The squid sauté only contained a very small amount of courgettes, the rest was tasteless dried noodles and something like cabbage - boring is the only word that comes to my mind here. The \"crevettes popcorn\" ($7) sounded interesting on the menu but arrived as lame breaded or battered shrimp that had been in the deep-fryer too long, resulting in very bitter aroma - no sauce or dip to kick it up a notch.  Summing up, I think \"uninspired\" is the best description I can give. All food maybe would have been okay in a neon tube chinatown setting. But we certainly expected a little more, particularly when we saw the cheque ($72 for 2 incl. ginger ale and a beer).  There are other places that do it better at a more reasonable price (although"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the service.. Chris you are simply \" THE BEST\"!!! The food is seasoned and really good.. Enjoyed the atmosphere, the music and the staff... Most of all the food was GREAT!!! Hey China town, you guys should thank Chris for bringing new \" flava \" to there unit. lol   I will always look for you in china town no matter where I go. I know you won't be there but you have changed the game with Orange Rouge!!! Yeaaaaaa!!! & Ymmmmmy!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Repas sincère et équilibré. Fortement conseillé. On est allé sur l'heure du midi en repas partagé. Tous les plats étaient excellents."}
{"text":"Service rapide, prix abordable. Belles portions. J'y retourne"}
{"text":"Excellent!  We shared duck, dandelion salad,  froi gras,  ribs & lomein.  Not a bad choice among them.  Asian fusion tapas is the best description.  I read some reviews stating that the portions were small.   I believe we have become so accustomed to super - size portions that normal portions look small.  I was satisfied with the volume of food and the quality was exquisite! Service was spot on.   Server was polite,  bilingual & helpful. Atmosphere was casual and fun.   Music was a tad loud for normal conversation but we were a loud bunch anyway.  I will definitely return on next trip into Montreal."}
{"text":"I always like to explore Chinatown in different metropolitan cities. We dropped in for lunch on a weekday and it was packed. We managed to get seated and started reading the menu. Without doing any prior research the menu looked a bit limited but we thought why not just take a shot. We had the shanghai noodles and papaya salad and both dishes were delicious. We also purchased a bottle of their hot sauce! We will just have to come back to Montreal when we run out!"}
{"text":"Orange Rouge est situé en plein coeur du quartier chinois, mais ne ressemble pas vraiment à un resto typique qui fait peur. À l'intérieur, c'est une atmosphère décontract/lounge qu'on y trouve.  C'est pas la place que vous allez vous bourrer, laissez-moi vous le dire tout de suite.  Le menu.  Le menu est vraiment varié. Vous pouvez le voir en ligne sur le site Internet si vous voulez vous ouvrir l'appétit. Ça marche par petits plats de 11 à 15$ que vous devez commander au moins par groupe de 2 par personnes. Je pensais à voir le menu que c'était un deal, mais à 2 plats par personne, ça fait un repas d'un coût normal.  Tout semble bon, ça a été très dure à choisir. Voici nos choix :  Croustilles de tapioca. Des genre de chips soufflées qui goûtent bonnes. Ça commence bien pour ouvrir l'appétit.  Mon coup de coeur du repas, le Ma Po au tofu fumé. Le tofu goûte vraiment bon et y'a une bonne quantité de bouffe.  Salade de menthe épicée : Ça fait un peu bizarre de manger de la menthe en salade, mais ça goûte bon. Je dirais que ça vaut peut-être pas 9$, mais une salade c'est bon pour la santé qu'ils disent.  Le plat d'aubergine : mouin. Ça goûte bizarre et faut aimer l'aubergine. Ça pas été mon coup de coeur.  Hoi Tod avec moules : C'est une genre de omelette avec plein de bouffe  dessus. Ben \"correct\".  Dessert malade : Xiao Long Bao. C'est un genre de dumpling de pêche avec du sirop sucré dedans. Sérieux, prenez-en au moins 1. Nous avons pris  chaque et c'était bien correct pour finir.  Y'a aussi des plats spéciaux pour groupe. Je ne sais pas si on va y retourner, mais on ne regrette pas la visite."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. I'm here so many times, I've had almost everything on the menu - it's all delicious! The staff is super nice and accommodating. We were one a group of ten and they were great! The albacore is like heaven in your mouth! The chef Minh Phat is a genius! Definitely go check it out! It's a super nice date option !"}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular food and well above average service. Had fried green onions and popcorn shrimp for appetizers followed by dumplings and spare ribs. The sauces for each dish were superb.   Wonderful combinations of flavors.  Wish we had a similar place at home. Not often in Montreal but would return in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"Overpriced and disappointing hipster/Chinatown fusion. Popcorn shrimp could've been from KFC, salad was wilted and pathetic, and Shanghai noodles left quite a bit to be desired. No need to return.  However, the servers were all excellent."}
{"text":"I'm elated that I happened on Orange Rouge during a walk through the city. I was greeted and seated promptly. The lights are low but it's a little loud in there so get in close for conversation.  To be completely honest, Orange Rouge cooked u some of the best food I've tried on recent history. I'm no culinary expert but I can guarantee that exceptional methods are used in the conception and execution of their dished. Pro tip: Order the green beans and thank me later.   The Spirits menu has something for everyone. Try one of their house cocktails, which are crafted as finely as their dishes."}
{"text":"As so many have said before, the best description of the food would be Southeast Asian tapas. And it numbers amongst the very best of both Asian and tapas restaurants at which I've had the pleasure of dining.   Our party of 3 opted for the popcorn shrimp and beef carpaccio/pho, followed duck, ribs and Vietnamese beef. The service was excellent and the tapas nature of the menu shined through with the dishes being delivered to the table as soon as they were ready and at their very best. The pho/carpaccio was a real eye-opener as to what can be achieved when one takes the best ingredients and techniques from around the world and forges them into something heretofore unimagined, and yet utterly, supremely delicious.   For me the menu was perfectly balanced, with twice as space dedicated to the wine list as the food. There's a wine for every taste, we opted for a Sancerre and something red a little later, and also tried the Mezcal Old Fashioned which was truly delicious.   When next I return to those shores, Orange Rouge will be on my list of must go to places."}
{"text":"Ok, I really liked this and I'll tell you why and mostly it's because everything about this place is unexpected. On an underdeveloped edge of an odd corner in Chinatown you find this brand new restaurant behind an odd facade. From outside and in you can see it's divided into two. One side, the kitchen, is brightly lit like a showcase with a crowd of diverse cooks. Like a live show you watch from the comfort of your table on the other side, in the dining room, where it is dim with clean warm hanging lighting, black and purple and glowing neon red crab decor, but not quite in an 80s way. It sort of nods smilingly at that 80s scene though, with black carpeting on the walls and such, but the food and cocktails are playful and new and the ambiance is modern, elegant, cool.   My Royal Jelly cocktail was weird and wonderful, like a Chinatown Manhattan. We ordered about 8 plates and agreed on 6 of them that we totally loved this. The other two were polarizing, but with these and all of them we always took pleasure in talking about the surprising things happening with the food. Standouts were the ribs and calamari, and we want to go back soon to share the duck, this looks fun and delicious. Liked it. Will do again, for sure, so nice to have a new option in that area and in the Montreal food scene in general."}
{"text":"Service excellent, cuisine vraiment délicieuse et ambiance super. Nous avons vraiment très bien mangé. Il y a longtemps que je voulais manger ici et nous n'avons pas été déçus."}
{"text":"This is a stylish place with great service and wonderful booze. But the food is largely pretentious. It's creative/innovative sure - but it's also entirely unremarkable in flavor. We ordered half the menu, sent some back, were comped others - couldn't get behind any of it. Save your money - have a meal at some other joint in Chinatown, then hit OR for a drink. The staff will take good care of you."}
{"text":"Despite all the good reviews for this place, I will stick to my initial comment: if u go to a so call Asian restaurant and there are no Asian people inside, get the f*** out!  Food was either too salty or too sweet. Went there for lunch and as soon as i got in realized that i was the inky asian person in there. Ive decided to still give it a try sinxe many of my foodie friends have had good comments about the place.   Seriously don't understand why people say it's one of the best restaurants in Montreal. Alright the place looks decent considering that it is in Chinatown but food just is ok."}
{"text":"RUDE STAFF  A friend and I made the mistake of going to this restaurant for lunch. There was nobody at the door and so we proceeded to sit at small table crammed between 2 people on each side. The waiter who seemed friendly brought us water and took our order. However, a couple of minutes after a rude gentleman told us to leave because we apparently did not wait for someone to sit us and a lady had called in advance to reserve a sit. There was no sign indicating that the table was reserved. We were told to get up and wait outside behind the door. We gladly left and are never coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Service was excellent-stars are strictly for the service.  Although when asked about how many takoyakis are in a plate, I was told it depends on how many were at the table. There were 2 of us and we only got 1 (at $4 a takoyaki ball). This is a place to go for experience, not so much for the food. They tell you at the beginning that the dishes are all designed to share, but even so it was too pricey for what we were given. Ended up paying ~$80 for dinner and still had to go somewhere else for food because of how scarce the food on the plates were."}
{"text":"Great food and a pretty cool atmosphere right in the middle of China town. Our group ended up ordering the chef's tasting menu (9-10 courses) for the six of us and we all really enjoyed it.  I took away one star only because I wasn't a fan of two of the dishes but that's probably to be expected when you're not the one deciding on the dish."}
{"text":"very cool dining room. excellent vibe. loved the duck and the mint salad. just one feels you can get better grub up the street without all the 'innovation'. love the tapas style small plates though. worth a go."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp last December when I was up in Montreal. A year later it was my first stop when I got into town.   I stopped in for lunch which has a decent crowd for a weekday and grabbed a seat at the bar. The staff is awesome and very knowledgeable about their menu.   Had the chrysanthemum salad as a starter while I watched through the window of the open kitchen as they made my Pork Ramen soup. I had this last year and it lived up to my expectations again this year. Rich broth, and a good size portion.    Already looking forward to returning next year."}
{"text":"Alright so this is a funky Korean-fusion spot in Chinatown that was opened by the former chef of Cafe Sardine. The menu is pretty ecclectic and the vibe inside is definitely way better than anywhere else in the neighborhood.  Food: I ate here with a group of friends from out of town so we got to try about 10 things on the menu which was fun. The menu items are definitely original (both in terms of the ingredients themselves and the combination of said ingredients) and the food was good for the most part, but none of the dishes were as delicious as, say, a Laksa from Satay Brothers or a seafood pancake from Hwang Kum. So yeah there's tons of fun stuff to discover but I wouldn't necessarily go back for any one dish in particular. I'd have to say the the food, overall, is a 7 on 10.  Service: The service was really great. Casual, friendly and quick. I give them a 10 on 10 for this.  Drinks: The drink menu rocks. They have tons of cocktails, a good wine list (for an Asian restaurant) and an A-MA-ZING Korean-style michelada.  Ambiance: The place has a really cool neon crab on the wall inside and it's definitely the nicest restaurant in Chinatown, but the design overall is not really remarkable. It was pretty quiet when we ate there though so maybe the place gets a little more magical when there is some hustle and bustle.  Overall I'd say that this is a fun spot to go to with a group of friends, and you'll probably get to try something you've never eaten before, but I don't think I'd add it to my list of \"go to\" places in the city just 'cause there wasn't any food item in particular that I fell in love with. But it's definitely fun to try. So yeah, try it."}
{"text":"We walked across this place purely by luck late in Chinatown. We were intrigued by the colourful walls outside the delicious smell flowing from the inside. We walked in and the chef just super nicely offered us to try a piece of dry soy sauce that he was making.    We ordered a bunch of dishes. I find the portions really small for a restaurant located in Chinatown. I understand that it's not really a standard Chinese restaurant, but I still find it relatively expensive and that's the reason why I'm giving this restaurant not full score.   The food however was really good. I loved the new American style mixed with some Asian flavors. The soft crab fried rice was the highlight you got to try it!"}
{"text":"Think about other asian restaurants in Chinatown as a functional iPhone 6 priced at $300, then Orange Rouge is a iPhone 7 priced at $600+: most likely you don't notice the difference, but the little extra could be worth the price depending on what kind of consumers you are.  I would have given you an objective 4 star for the food (on the salty side but creatively spiced and well presented), but i will instead give it a 5 star because no other Asian restaurants in this city can provide such attentive service!  I do notice that I'm the only Asian person here, but I think most Asians come to Chinatown for inexpensive and traditional comfort food, but they don't provide any of that, hence the bad rating from some people. Just compare it with other trendy new cuisine such as Lawrence in Mile-end or fine cocktail bar such as Le Mal Neccessaire, then you won't think it's overpriced! All dishes are different - from soft shell crabs in fried rice to raw beef in extremely tasty Vietnamese spices; and despite the duck is twice the price as the one you get 20metres away in a traditional restaurant, it is so perfectly seasoned that you won't regret trying them."}
{"text":"Food is really really good. Service was fantastic and the place looks great. Highly recommend for two people or more. Pork belly, dessert dumplings, calamari salad, mint salad, orange ice cream, ma po tofu were all great. Enjoy!"}
