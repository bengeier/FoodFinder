{"text":"This is my breakfast spot.  It's nothing fancy, but I enjoy coming in with my fiance in the morning and having breakfast.  All of the staff are incredibly nice and genuine people.  I really like their coffee too!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the people who work there! Food is excellent for breakfast, lunch or dinner! Always a must when in Monticello!"}
{"text":"I live in the Seattle area, but I frequently visit my mom in Monticello, and she and I enjoy eating at Main Street Pub!  They're known for their fantastic fried appetizers (including fried green beans!), and I can see why.  I always toy with the idea of ordering the appetizer platter, but I usually wind up getting the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries.  The buffalo sauce is fab!  My mom recently ordered the burger and fries from the senior menu and thought it was a great value.    I do wish that the Pub's sandwiches came with fries rather than chips (homemade or no, chips are something I can just as easily eat at home), and I'm not crazy about the idea of paying an extra $1.75 for fries, but I always leave the pub feeling full and happy."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat. I have never had food there I didn't like! They have an awesome country fried steak special. I also enjoy their Thursday night wings!!"}
{"text":"Good, clean, a variety of food choices and they are economical.  Please are always pleasant."}
{"text":"We were staying nearby and came here for a beer. It was obvious that everyone knew each other and that we were out-of-towners. Ha ha.   It was a nice change of pace. Everyone was really nice to us and chatty. It made it for a fun experience.   I ended up getting the special of the day, which was the fish sandwich and I also ordered a New Belgium (I was a little surprised that they had it!).  The fish was perfect. I made a great choice. It was lightly fried with excellent taste and they left the tartar sauce on the side!! The homemade chips were amazing and I don't normally eat chips!   I am so happy we ventured out and found this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of our must stops when in the area! It is a really cool price of history in Monticello and the atmosphere is very unique! Family friendly with Great food! My all time favorite is the Fire burger. They make their own secret sauce that is out of this world! Try the fire burger if you dare!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a bite to eat and a beer while I was in Monticello buying a car. The staff was friendly and service was prompt. I had the lunch special with was a grilled tenderloin and fries and it was delicious!  I felt very comfort sitting at the bar by myself and enjoying a couple beers. The place was also very clear. Great little pub that I will definitely come back to again"}
{"text":"Standard Pub Menu but with very good quality food. As a local, we hit it up once a week. Big fan of the burgers and wings.  Not well known...this is a great place in town for a fresh Sunday Breakfast/Brunch."}
{"text":"This place had a good martini, but, overall, it's pretty lackluster.  Traditional fried bar food and burgers. Don't waste your time here when you can go to Three Ravens, less than 100 feet away."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in town! The pub is so cute and everyone seems to know each other ! There wings, cheese balls and burgers are too die for. Definitely recommend if you're passing through town!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. In Monticello on business and have friends in Monticello so this is where we meet for lunch."}
{"text":"The service was good but it takes a long time to get your food for the quality.  it is something that I could make at home on my own with a deep friar and a grill.  Most of the options on the menu is pretty garden variety without anything that really pops or sounds unique."}
{"text":"The coffee has a Burnt taste to it yuk ! This place puts some food out Sunday's breakfast hours ( Limited 8-12 hours ) we had a long wait on our delivery of our order ! ( party of four) I picked the scrambler just what you expect out of a pub average food taste"}
