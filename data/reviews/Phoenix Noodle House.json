{"text":"Amazing and yummy the cheung fun . Definitely will come back to try their specialty soups and other dishes"}
{"text":"Came here today for a quick meal. Not been for a while, think the owners are changed. Gentleman at the till was really polite and friendly. We ordered won ton noodles, shrimp dumpling lai fan and shrimp dumpling noodles. We wanted ho fan but the guy said that he was sold out. Bowls of food were only $5 plus tax and included soy milk or chinese tea. The bowls were quite a decent size. The food itself was quite good but for the price, I ain't expecting great things. 
Good place to come for a quick bowl of food. They also serve congee and rice rolls. The congee of the day was sliced chicken today and was only $3.30 a bowl.  I would come back again if I was looking for some quick food in Market Village."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot. A nice bowl of dumplings and noodles in broth plus a cup of soy milk for $5. If you're looking for something cheap and fast and don't want to jump through some hoops, Phoenix Noodle House does the trick."}
{"text":"Phoenix is best for a cheap, fast eat.  I ordered breakfast special which consisted of congee and rice rolls ($3.75).  Congee tasted okay; rice rolls were too wimpy and small, made it kind of the wrong texture.  There is another fast food booth in the food court of Pacific Mall that offers the same dish at higher price, but both its congee and rice rolls are better."}
{"text":"Went here last week, order their special house noodle and found a bug in it! Won't come here again."}
{"text":"For dishes that vary around $5+, you cannot go wrong with that! I got the BBQ pork noodle soup since I love BBQ pork, it took awhile for them to make it. Soup was good, noodles were great and bbq pork complemented the entire dish very well. Cheap + delicious all in one."}

Phoenix Noodle House is located in the food court of Market Village. I have been going there for quick congee and steam rice roll fix when Sam's Congee is brutally busy or not opened as yet.

Breakfast ($3.75) from 9 am - 12 pm offers a good choice of congee with steamed plain rice roll when is quite decent at that price.

They also offers a different congee on specials depends on the day of the week for $3.10. There is also the day specials ($4.25) comes with choice of Chinese tea/soy milk. 

Shrimp Dumplings Rice Noodle Soup ($4.25) was not really good. The filling is more pork and with just a little bit of shrimp and the texture is quite mushy and pretty bland tasting. 

If you want something cheap/value, Phoenix Noodle House might be the place for you."}
