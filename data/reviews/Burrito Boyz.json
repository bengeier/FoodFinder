{"text":"Love this place .... Honestly best Burrito in Toronto  Halibut is tasty, simple, flaky .... Brilliant"}
{"text":"I finally went to Burritos Boyz the other day and I was really pleased with what I got. Flavourwise and servicewise it trumps Chipotle entirely.

I got a vegan burrito and didn't feel deprived of anything, it was a nice big meal. I really liked how they constructed it. It made a huge difference when biting in. There was an intermingling of flavours rather then the usual \"oh here's rice, oh here's lettuce, oh here's salsa\"  feeling I get from some other places. It was quite filling, though I probably could have eaten two for lunch. I think grilling the burrito is a nice touch, crispy on the outside warm and yummy on the inside. 

They have veggie ground round, and vegan guacamole, and hot sauce that's actually hot. I wish they also had some daiya, because that would have made this place all around perfect.

We got there right before the lunchtime rush, so not only did we get our orders quickly, I even snagged a seat in the corner."}
{"text":"BEST After-Bar Food. Period. Open 'til 4am on weekends, always packed with people. I've only ever had the large steak burritos, but I can't imagine any other kind could be better!"}
{"text":"I just enjoyed a large halibut burrito from Burrito Boyz. It's my favourite in Toronto along with Big Fat's Pulled Pork Burrito. I'm curious about BFB's breakfast one! I'm so addicted to the halibut though, that I can't seen to order anything else from BBz. I am in such a late night burrito mood tonight!

 

I had to award both Burrito Boyz and Big Fat Burrito #1 to be fair. When I am craving a fish burrito, I go to BB. When I want something meaty, I go to BFB. It's as simple as that.

1a. Burrito Boyz
Halibut Burrito ($8.85 small, $9.73 large
)Halibut Burrito - so much sauce, so much win!
The tortilla is toasted on a flat-top grill and the large gives you 1.5 lb of fish! Add a very generous helping of sauces: Lime-Chili Burrito sauce, sour cream, and hot sauce. Most of my friends get little to no hot sauce, but I like asking for two lines. Yum.
I almost wrote this place off after trying their steak burrito - the beef was tough and unappetizing, despite the plethora of fillings. I'm really glad that I gave the place another go and tried their halibut burrito! I can ever resist its call...while curious about their veggie soy and shrimp burritos, I haven't been able to say no to halibut.
1b. Big Fat Burrito
Pulled Pork
I lo-o-o-ve their pulled pork burrito! It's always saucy, soft, and so good with guacamole. I always manage to stuff myself with a large without a single regret! You can get some yam in it too!

3. Burrito Bandidos
Steak Burrito
This is third because I only tried their steak - I bet their fish is just as good as Burrito Boyz. If I was ranking this on the steak alone, it'd be lower but I ought to be fair since the owners used to work together at Burrito Boyz so they're virtually identical.

4. Z-teca
Beef Barbacoa Burrito
Tried the one at Fairview Mall - this a popular chain. Pretty good if you're in the area and want a burrito fix! They're also often featured on Group Buy sites, so keep your eyes open for deals.

5. Chipotle Mexican Grill
Carnitas
Owned by McDonalds, this has been a major hit-or-miss for me. The last time I went, the person who made my burrito jammed it full of Carnitas and I was very pleased. The time before that, the server was quite grumpy and I got a small handful of chicken. Nonetheless, when I needed a quick burrito fix around Yonge & Dundas, Chipotle did the trick...until Big Fat Burrito moved in. I rather like their Cilantro-Lime flavoured rice

6. Burro Burrito
Steak ($7.99 Large)
Located beside my beloved Fish Store, I popped by after a game of floor hockey. This was in my early burrito-blitzing days and I think that I've since realized that steak burritos are not the way to go unless if you're ordering them from a good restaurant like my visit to Sweet Smoke's BBQ

7. Burrito Loco
Chicken Burrito
So close to being finished before the picture was taken! Oops!

Of course, there's also Sweet Smoke's Flat Iron Steak burrito but since it's at a restaurant it's in a totally different class on it's own.
Steak Burrito win @ $9, but not quick eats on the streets of Toronto

Honourable Mentions - Not true Burritos but I still love 'em:
1. The Fish Store
Tried almost everything - best: Black Cod Burrito with Avocado
Honestly, if this was open later and closer to my place I'd get this over Burrito Boyz any day. The Fish Store is fantastic - they offer a huge selection of seafood that you can in sandwich or a wrap (which they call a burrito). Love Love Love.

2. NY Subway
Potato burrito, cauliflower burrito, lamb burrito
These aren't traditional burritos either - however their potato & cauliflower burritos are great! Totally recommend getting one of these over their meaty options."}
{"text":"Im a burrito boys veteran and let me tell you this place is terrible, its like they serve completely different burritos compared to the other burrito boys locations. If you're going to eat at burrito boys go to other locations and stay away from this one. The portions are small, the chicken is chewy.. like u have to spit it out..ughh. ALL other locations are 5 star and are the best burritos ive tried in the city"}
{"text":"Coming back! Really enjoyed the food :) They make a veggie soy burrito like no other, and I really adored the portion sized. Well worth it, and definitely something that I'm going to try again."}
{"text":"I went there once today since burrito bandidos opens up at 5 on sundays, I like burrito bandidos more. The burritos here are slightly small and they are not generous when it comes to the meat portion. Also it didn't taste as good as burrito bandidos. If you can walk 5 minutes longer I recommend burrito bandidos more than burrito boys."}
{"text":"Good fast service. You cannot go wrong with Mexican. Quick bites. I eat here often."}
{"text":"Talk about getting some bang for your buck! One burrito from here (even a \"small\") is enough to last you comfortably through two meals... Possibly three, depending on your appetite. 

Service is fairly quick, even when it's packed, and the employees are very friendly. The cook especially. He is pretty entertaining to watch as he bops around the kitchen to whatever song is on, and he often gets creative when calling out order numbers. 

But the food is the main attraction - obviously. You have to get the halibut burrito. Seriously. I'm not even joking with you right now. Get it loaded up with everything they offer, with a good ol' slathering of their xxx hot sauce, grab a seat, and prepare to be in heaven. 
Need a little bit more? Have them add steak or chicken to the wrap at no extra cost (the price they charge will the the higher of the two individuals). 

Burrito Boys is a small, dive-y looking place, but it packs some wonderful people, a great atmosphere, and some seriously tasty flavours. 
Try it sober, try it drunk, try it high. It doesn't matter... All I know is - you'll leave with a full wallet, and one hell of a full stomach."}
{"text":"Though I've never actually eaten here other than between the hours of 2am - 4am filled with a night of liberal drinking, I still remember this to have the best halibut burrito ever. And it's BIG, so share with friend, unless you want to do a mental walk of shame the next morning for eating the entire thing yourself. 

Be prepared, it's a small place and usually with a fairly  long line. Well worth the wait! You'll get the gist of how their ordering/number system works fairly quickly, even in your intoxicated state. *Yum*!"}
{"text":"One of the best burrito in town. Great selection of toppings .Even a small burrito weight like a brick! The line up can be massive during rush hr. so strongly recommend go around 2 or call in advance to place ur order and go pick up."}
{"text":"OMG
so my boyfriend took me here yesterday
I WAS SO STOKED because i read so many good reviews about this place and i've been dying to go here for a year already!

i'm telling you...Burrito Boyz stole my heart, haha

I ordered the shrimp burrito with basically everything on it
and it was like..well...LOVE AT FIRST BITE =P
Everything tasted so good and thank goodness the shrimp weren't those dinky small ones...

I'm tellin you...this is my new fav place =)"}
{"text":"The food is good but on a number of occasions I've felt as if I am intruding on teen basement party: loud music,  staff yelling at each other over the customers' conversations, tables coated with previous diner's drippings. Last Wednesday I sat at the least filthy table and suddenly,  after I started to eat, a staff member began to spray and wipe my table.  She seemed to resent that I was not taking my burrito out. This place needs a grownup manager to remind the staff that they are at work, and that customers serve an important role in a business

The atmosphere should be mre welcoming."}
{"text":"Like every Burrito Boyz in Ontario,  this one gives us great food in an unpretentious atmosphere. I have eaten at five or six of these and it is great to have one on Roncesvalles;  it adds to that corner."}
{"text":"I really like it! I wanna recommend beef burrito! It's awesome! I think here is better than Chipole."}
{"text":"Update:  have been going to this place for a year and they still can't get my burrito right...always make it spicy even when I ask for nothing spicy and the staff sucks. There's this one girl that puts NO guacamole and no exaggeration she spreads it like butter to the point where you can still see the tortilla and if you ask for more she says it's more $$ to add more guacamole ... Like I understand to add more is more $$ but the burrito doesn't have any!! Ugh this location sucks."}
{"text":"I used to be regular at the Burrito Boyz franchises in Mississauga and raved about the epic meal that followed a visit.

The particular visit at this location left me disappointed. Last Tuesday I ordered a small chicken and shrimp burrito with all the fixings. I was excited to bite into the hot cheesy goodness. Instead the burrito was room temperature at best and the chicken lacked flavour and was missing the crispy bits that usually followed cooking on the flat top.

After struggling through a few bites, I asked to have the food reheated. Instead the supervisor was nice enough to have the burrito remade for me, and offered a free drink while I waited. 

The remade burrito was definitely hot (temperature wise) but overall still lacked flavour. 

Will I return? Probably not.

Two stars is for the service alone."}
{"text":"Everything is so fresh here and everyone who works here is so friendly. Highly recommend it to anybody looking for an easy, healthy, delicious lunch."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. The food is amazing and the employees are the so freakin kind! I know I was being a little annoying because it was my first time there but the girl taking my order was patient and even suggested some toppings I could add. Will definitely be going there again"}
{"text":"The burritos are ginormous!  The prices are reasonable, the food is good, and the portions are huge.  The only thing I would complain about is that they can be a bit slow, but it's not worth docking a star over for.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"Prefer the location on college street, this one opened a couple weeks ago so the staff   Seems to be still figuring things out.  Great addition to my neighbourhood, was getting bored of all the Korean restos in the area.  Have been twice since it opened, first time not enough toppings and the girl making it was told to redo it by the grill person, second time I went it was overfilled and had a burnt taste.  Both times had a chicken burrito.  Good location and very clean and spacious inside, so I'll prob go again in a few months when the kinks have been worked out."}
{"text":"Cheap, filling and pretty quick. Can't complain too much about that. The halibut and shrimp mix is one of my favorites!  A tip for the guy who said that they fill the burritos with rice and beans... Order it without rice and beans!  You can pick what is on it."}
{"text":"So good! It's always busy and so can be a long wait - call ahead and pick up instead!"}
{"text":"Ate here today for the first time.  To start off I want to say I was impressed with the speed of the service and the cleanliness of the space.  It seemed at any given point at least one person was tidying up or wiping something down.  I greatly appreciate this and generally makes me happy.  
Having said that, I was disappointed with the food in general.  I originally wanted a pork burrito but they do not have pork so I had chicken instead.  That was a mistake.  The chicken was beyond bland, dry and hard.  It seemed like it was sitting out for way too long.  All of the flavours and textures just seemed to mush together and nothing stood out.  I really wish these burrito places could stand out from one another but they all just seem the same.  On a good note the hot sauce is really hot, I like that.
I would not go back to this place as it seems I can get the same thing anywhere else.  Price was very reasonable though."}
{"text":"Burritos in Toronto eh?  I was compelled to find out how it compares to Tex-Mex in Cali.  I ordered the Halibut burrito.  They put all this extra sauce on it that was totally unnecessary (Thousand Island Sauce)?  And where is my salsa??!!  They need to get a Panini press to speed up the final cooking step which manifests a nice crispy burrito crust.  All in all not bad."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to go to for a filling lunch. It's close to the Acc and Rogers Centre. My favorite thing to order is a steak and shrimp burrito or bowl. The veggies are fresh and the portions are generous. I've also tried halibut and it's amazing. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes it's really busy and waiting in line at lunch time, sometimes even after calling in and pre-ordering."}
{"text":"I feel like the only way to properly enjoy a night out in the entertainment district is to end it noshing at Burrito Boyz. Ignore your inner Canadian urging you to Smoke's upstairs and sink your face into a satisfying, chunky, Mexican heaven roll instead.

I love how the staff have perfected the craft of stuffing as much filling into a tortilla as possible without it exploding everywhere once you eat it. You can ask them to adorn your burrito with a diversity of toppings, then scale according to your desired spiciness level. Then they close it and toasty it up on a flat-top grill. Perfection.

There is also surprising awesomeness to be found in the quesadillas. They took a bit longer to make (probably just because we messed up the flow of things in the kitchen), but they are way delicious.

I honestly just wish Burrito Boyz was everywhere so I could have amazing burritos all the time."}
{"text":"I had the small, whole wheat chicken burrito and was less than ecstatic about it. The tortilla is tasty and the burrito is packed with all that good stuff like beans & cheese, guacamole, etc..however the chicken was dry and a little bland. The guacamole also didn't have much flavour. I've had better burritos!"}
{"text":"Love. Always consistent. Toppings are fresh. Seen them even making the guac and they don't charge extra. Wish I lived closer"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed in the quality of the steak last night.  Each bite was a combination of grit and or tendon.  Last few visits have left me wondering about the quality of meat being used."}
{"text":"Comparing to other burrito boyz this one falls short. The staff is very slow, walked in when it was empty and it took a while to place the order and even longer to choose the toppings. The amount of toppings you get is very very little. At other locations the burrito is overflowing with toppings, at this one there was barely anything on it. I literately got 6 black beans on the whole burrito. Located close to my house but I'd rather drive down the street to the dundas location."}
{"text":"Even though it's become a franchise the quality hasn't slipped. Can't go wrong with either the quesadilla or burrito, chicken in particular. The burrito sauce with the quesadilla is absolutely yummy. Good Tex-Mex in the suburbs."}
{"text":"The problem isn't so much with the burritos. They're awesome. 

Nor the service - great things take time and instant Burrito technology is a long way from perfect.

The problem is that at 2am, you are starving, and so is every other drunken, loud dickwad out prowling the entertainment district, and they all converge on Burrito Boyz. 

You will wait and wait and wait. 

You will listen to 20 year old guys tell their girlfriends that the next time they see so-and-so there's going to be \"a situation\".

Last time I considered dropping in late at night - no word of a lie - I saw a guy drop his pants in the middle of the road and wave his wang around at someone who had just declined his challenge to fight.

That said, I love coming here for lunch. They should get a bouncer for Friday & Saturday nights, though. I would consider coming back for late-night burritos if I could see a decent wrestling match with my meal."}
{"text":"Not as good as the lakeshore and other Mississauga locations. Took 25 mins for my burrito but i called ahead. I had to wait 10 mins in the store as they did not acknowledge my order and i saw it sitting on the side. I finally told the guy that is my burrito and he said oh whoops. First time there last time. Ill stick to the stavebank and other locations as I know they are great!"}
{"text":"I have to give these guys the nod...its one of the best reasons to be in Port Credit.  Great fresh food, whimsical staff and a homemade hot sauce that'll kick ya in the pants."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Burrito Boyz, and I was completely unimpressed by the service that I experienced. 

It wasn't busy at all (slightly after 1 PM on a Thursday) and there was no line-up besides me and another customer. I placed an order expecting to come out with a Burrito in 10 minutes. That's not what happened. I had to wait around 15 minutes before someone actually fulfilled my order. I found it bizarre, of course, that the two girls at the front were completely pre-occupied with their own conversation and the tons of staff in the back to actually pick up my receipt and make my Burrito. I thought I should say something, but being it was my first time at the restaurant and I wasn't sure how things were done,  I was hesitant to ask. I stood there by the counter, waiting.

When one of the girls finally realized that my order/receipt had been waiting on the table for a good 15 minutes when they went to fulfil another customer's order, they didn't even apologize. They merely asked me what I wanted and acted like nothing had happened. Ironic, because one of their employees in the back had been staring at me standing their for 15 minutes.

In hindsight, I should have said something, but shouldn't they have said something? I stood at the counter there for that long and nobody even bothered to ask me if there was anything wrong. 

Other competitors have much better service The only thing Burrito Boyz does well is the food. For some, that's enough, but for me bad service always leaves a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Only giving this a four because it's not consistent with staff changes or between the two Brampton locations. Love the one queen most days. Friendly service, usually comes perfectly made, cooked, & tastes fantastic. 
The one on hwy 10 & Steeles isn't nearly as good. Staff never appear friendly & it usually ends up burnt, which is why it probably takes longer as well. 

Life the idea of the shit down area but the entrance to it being where you order means always having to walk between the line up to sit down."}
{"text":"As a fifth-generation New Mexican, I can say Burrito Boyz (despite the fact most employees are lovely, brilliant women) makes a fine burrito. All the trimmings you would expect and then some you wouldn't (like sweet potato, halibut and haddock!). They take a bit longer than what you might expect from a SF mission burrito because they're roasted for a bit in the oven... which not only means they're toasty but gives the tortilla a nice crisp snap. Bravo, Canada!"}
{"text":"There are a few staples in Toronto, Burrito Boyz being one them.   They used to be joined together with the Peter Street location, but no longer. 

I've been comparing the locations over the last little while, and my heart was leaning towards Peter Street, but I have to say, after my last tasting at Adelaide, my thumbs go up for them. 

The experience in the line wasn't amazing.  I was confused as to why they handed me a number, if they had to ask me for my receipt, and what I ordered.  I ended up asking them \"what is the purpose of the number, if you don't know my order?\"   I was drunk though...as I usually am when I go to Burrito Boyz...as...everybody usually is, when they go to Burrito Boyz. 

I immediately felt regret for acting like a drunk duesche, the moment I took a bite of that Burrito.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly divided ingredients, just the right amount of spice...oh man.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  It truly was the best Burrito experience I have had to date. 

This may have been the staff working that night, but I hope that is not the case, and that this experience will be replicated my next visit.  I will certainly keep you up to date, as I go there often.

Trust me, the indigestion is absolutely worth the trouble."}
{"text":"The prices went up recently I believe as I ordered a large steak burrito and the price was very different from a few weeks back. At the new price it's not worth it. Before it was a cheap option open late in Mississauga. I always call ahead as it can be busy. The hot sauce sometimes differs it can be hot or just medium-ish. The meat sometimes isn't fresh - had some cold pieces of steak once. There are better burrito choices now other than burrito boyz."}
{"text":"It's amazing. Decent pricing. I can come back a million times.

Expect a little bit of a wait time for preparation and long line ups. Totally worth it though."}
{"text":"Have been gong here for a while now.
Consistently fast good food that is well priced and delicious. Just finished eating the best burrito I've ever had from them (halibut).
 I had a problem with a mistake they made on an order and they went out of their way to make things right.
This is the kind of business I am happy to support and patronize. Kudos to this place, try run a tight ship."}
{"text":"I like a good burrito but I LOVE a great burrito. Burrito Boyz does everything right as far as I'm concerned. All the ingredients are fresh and tasty. I had a burrito at their Richmond? location a couple of years ago and it was a memorable experience. I had to check out the new location in my neighbourhood to see if they have maintained their standards of quality. 

They have!

I got a halibut burrito (10$ with tax). a hefty price for Mexican fast food but I watched them batter and fry my fish on the spot. This burrito must have weighted a pound and a quarter. There is no disappointment about portion size here. The fish was not overcooked but tender and delicious. It worked so well with the fresh tomato and creamy quacamole. 

I feel like I could easily be sucked into a burrito vortex by this convenient location. I'm in danger."}
{"text":"I still find burritos rather bland but the place does a good job with them for the most part. Orders are messed up from time to time but we're only human."}
{"text":"Amazing burritos, knowledgable staff, and fair prices. I definitely come to this place every now and then, and it's always PACKED. It's worth the wait, though. Huge burritos and packed with punch."}
{"text":"Good food (especially for the price), but I wish they didn't burn the burritos while toasting them..."}
{"text":"We finally got to Toronto around 11pm and desperately needed some food.  We did the 'ole YELP search for Indian food and it brought us to a place that was closed,   BUT within that same very strip of stores, there was a Burrito joint.  YAY!  Meat-eaters and vegetarians alike can all rejoice in the mexican fare!  

First thing we noticed was the beckoning of today's youth through the sounds of top 40 hits blasting through Speakers OUTSIDE the place.  Kind of a rare thing for any establishment, especially a mexican one.  I asked my friend Ardith Birchall about this, and she said they all do it in an effort to attract \"the kids from the clubs.\"  This is all fine and good, but the first song we heard playing over the speakers was that track \"Mr. Brightside\" by The Killers.  Sooooooo...great strategy if you wanna get all the kids from the clubs back in 2005.  Actually, they're probably real hungry after stepping outside for the first time in 6 years.

This is a popular Canadian chain of Burrito spots that all the folks (young and old...drunk and sober) hit up at some point in the night, so there's no need for me to get into the fact that they started to close up before taking our order, ran out of meat, (thereby rendering all power to the vegetarian) or forgot to put guacamole inside our burritos; but I WILL get into the story of just how Burrito Boyz came to be.  It's a captivating one.  One that we can all agree HAD to be told and will only become more and more enigmatic as the years progress.  It's a story rich in heritage that will one day put Mississauga, Ontario on the map, along with every other town astute enough to embrace the famed Boyz of Burrito.  Canada should consider itself lucky to be endowed with the brilliance of these 2 entrepreneurs and their majestic story can be found proudly displayed on the wall of any and all Burrito Boyz locations....yes, it's THAT good!  

Here it goes: 

Once upon a time in the late 90's, two guys had finished a long night of partying. They found themselves standing on a street corner when one guy says, \"I'm hungry.\"  Then the other guy said, \"Yeah, me too.  I want a burrito.\"  And the rest is history...

(no joke.  This is what it says on the wall of Burrito Boyz)

We ate in the van, cuz the \"ambience\" was killing us, but in all honesty,  those burritos were tasty.

{"text":"I have ordered and picked up our food for almost every week over the past year or so and the food is amazing and consistent all the time. The burrito sauce is perfect. Open late and satisfies late night hunger."}
{"text":"I had my first Burrito Boyz about a year ago at a Hamilton location. I would give that one 2 stars at best. But last week, my boyfriend felt like a burrito, so we stopped at this location since it's close by us. The service was fast, though maybe a little too fast when she was putting all the toppings on. I was still on one section (not going slow, mind you, I knew what I wanted), and she was already throwing everything from the next section on. I didn't want green peppers, so she had to try and take them out. 

Once we got our burritos (bean and cheese for me), we dug right in. This one was 100x better than the one I had had before. It was amazing. All of the toppings were in every bite and they weren't stingy on the gauc and sour cream. I'm a small person and was able to get through about 85% of my burrito. I took the small remaining portion home, much to my boyfriend's dismay, and ate it as soon as we walked in the door. Yeah, I felt a little too full after, but worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite.

I go here every time I head downtown. FYI, getting a small burrito will fill up most people cause the portions are huge. Good idea to order ahead of time cause there is always line ups."}
{"text":"Rating    A-OK.

I've been to many Burrito Boyz locations and they're always delicious, but no one at this particular location seems to know how to wrap a burrito. I live just around the corner so I've been here several times, and every time they are so loosely wrapped that I end up with a soggy, sloppy mess. Like I said, it still tastes great, just know that you're going to need a fistful of napkins."}
{"text":"Having had both Fat Bastard and Burrito Boyz (They're across the street from each other- don't mix them up!), I gotta say- Burrito Boyz comes out on top. 

However, there's been a few things at this location that are less than stellar. The staff can be hit or miss - some of them (at least the front counter staff I've dealt with) seem to be fed up with customers. The difference between way they will talk to customers and then turn around and talk to other staff is astonishing. You'd think we were personally insulting some of them. 

Additionally- and it's not Burrito Boyz fault AT ALL- parking is usually difficult at this location. Because it's so popular, the small lot is almost ALWAYS full, and you'll have to drive a few hundred meters down a side street to park if the lot is full. 

If you want a hot, tasty burrito and don't mind brusque staff and a bit of wait (The meat is cooked FRESH!)- this place cannot be beat."}
{"text":"This is my go to burrito place...great price... Fresh garnishes....super awesome!! Parking can be a bit difficult but park on a side street and walk in.... You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Mmm...Burrito Boyz is the one place I go to for burritos and quesadillas, and it's this location in particular. 

We come here quite a bit during the summer, but the freezing weather this winter has us cooking and eating at home more often. How amazing would it be if Burrito Boyz delivered? (Oh nevermind... I just checked their website and it says some locations do deliver! But you'll have to call to confirm.)

Our most recent visit was last week. We decided to get Burrito Boyz on our way home from work. I called ahead to place an order and the cashier was very friendly. She even took the time to repeat what I had ordered before hanging up. I was told it would take about 15-20 minutes and by the time we arrived, we just had to line up to pay, then we were already on our way out. 

My boyfriend always orders a large halibut and shrimp burrito, and he loves it. It's a good size for someone with a big appetite and it's nice to be able to have two main ingredients in the same burrito (they charge you for whichever costs more). 

My favourite at Burrito Boyz is their shrimp quesadilla with a side of guacamole. Their shrimps are always big and chunky, and their guacamole is a great addition to their burrito sauce and salsa. Sometimes, I find they are a little stingy on the cheese but otherwise, it's pretty good.

We will definitely be coming back even though there is always a bit of a wait!"}
{"text":"Since 2 months I've moved from San Francisco to around the corner from this location, so maybe I'm spoiled when it comes to burritos.

This place has a couple things going for them, but there are a few things they need to change sooner than later.

1st - they really need to work in the time it take for a burrito to be made. 
Honestly 10-15 min for a tortilla with some pre prepped ingredients is way to long.

2nd - they tell you to sit down while they prepare your burrito.
the ingredients are behind the glass, so when I have selected the type of tortilla, just ask me what kind of options I want. Not what I don't want and then just add everything else. 
2 times in a row my order has come out with the wrong ingredients.
(This is definitely my biggest annoyance)
3rd - get a steamer. This will help with nr1.

4th - rolling the ingredients in the tortilla and then the burrito in tin foil is not that hard, but every time, because they flatten them on the grill plate you can clean what ever you're wearing because it spills out the bottom.

I have to say that the food flavors and people that work there are really nice.
I would just like to see these point worked on.

Until that time I'll be looking around for another shop."}
{"text":"Awesome. I needed to find a bite to eat for lunch and this popped up on Yelp nearby. Glad I found it. Large chicken burrito really hit the spot. The lineups are long, and its a bit loud and crowded in there, but I think that comes with being popular!  I've been told to try the halibut; that's up next week."}
{"text":"I like Burrito Boyz. The place is a dive in a strip plaza at Dundas and Hwy 10. You'll get served by a 20 year old with purple hair and holes in their face who is shouting over loud music. But you know that and you really dont care. They get you in and out and the burritos taste good. After all, thats all you really care about. Right? I recommend the Chicken and Shrimp burrito."}
{"text":"So excited to have a burrito boyz near me! Great food & huge portions at a decent price. Although its just not the same as the original downtown location....
I always get the beef. They are HUGE. you can go with the small and be stuffed!
Everything here is fresh and the place is always clean. 
Delicious. You must try!"}
{"text":"These burritos are tasty  for lunch, but amazing if you have one after the bar. The line up number system can be a bit intimidating but the results are worth it.

That hot sauce is basically a mouth fire. Ask for it on the side and then you can add it if/as needed."}
{"text":"Still the best burritos in Toronto. Large Hali on white and you are good to go. However I do dislike that they now charge you for guacamole, but I guess so does everyone else so it is okay I guess."}
{"text":"This will be a review of the franchise in general, been to 3 individual ones, 2 in Toronto and one in Waterloo (been maybe 15 times in total in last 8 months). The thing that stands out most is the sheer amount of food given to you, whether that food is mediocre or good really seems random based on my experience. There's so much inconsistency in the food,  depending on which \"burrito artisan\" you get serving you, there will be a variance in the proportion of protein to rest of burrito (veggies & sauce) you get, which makes it interesting not in a necessarily good way. Overall, enjoy haddock the most, the halibut is A-OK, but sometimes ends up tasting a bit bland. Also dislike the fact that even though I ask for \"no green peppers\" i seem to end up getting them 50% of the time."}
{"text":"Went at a busier time than the Dundas St W location yet the customer service was still better. They were all super nice and smiling. They didn't look miserable and asked you after each toppings if they put on enough for you. Recommend this location over others who will be stingy on toppings and then even weigh your burrito and tell you that you over exceeded the amount of a topping you can get?
Definitely prefer this location over others. You can tell management focuses customer satisfaction over saving money."}
{"text":"Long lines but very fast service. The sweet potatoe option is the way to go. The fish is fried - not good at all."}
{"text":"Get the steak and shrimp mix so worth it, the shrimp they use is so juicy, and it compliments the steak well. I used to just get Steak, but found it boring and sometime bland after awhile, but with the shrimp, I became a fan again."}
{"text":"CHA CHING!  This place is a gold mine and with good reason.  Burritos are delish and always freshly made, hot off the grill. Good food, good service and great price. What is not to like?"}
{"text":"The best buritos in the GTA! Alot of different options and great value for what you pay for. I probably eat here once every week or so. I definantly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I remember my first burrito here - the haiibut - after a long night of dancing at a nearby club. It was heaven on earth and exactly what I needed.

It's been years (shhh...) since then, but the burritos are still good and I've moved on to the Adelaide location to occasionally snag a late-night (though not quite as late-night) meal.

My favourites are the halibut and the shrimp, loaded up with everything and some extra cilantro. And with the hot hot-sauce. That's it. I'm not a complicated girl.

Though they're neither cheap nor fast, these burritos fulfil a need: late-night hunger pangs; but their burritos aren't going to blow your mind or make you a convert if you hate burritos. They're good - sometimes really good - but they're burritos. Enjoy them as such."}
{"text":"Terrible service! NEVER COMING BACK!

My coworkers and I were having a busy day at work so we decided to call in ahead of time to place a pre-order to avoid the lunch rush wait. When we got there, the Manager was reluctant to provide us 3 separate bills because he said I didn't explicitly told the staff it was 3 separate orders which I DID. All our burrito orders were for small size but they charged one of us large cause the Manager said that was what the staff was told by me. Well, I'm pretty sure I didn't ask for a large burrito order but the Manager didn't even proceed to apologize or say there might be a miscommunication and still charged my coworker for a large burrito. He just kept mumbling \"there is so many errors in this order\". YES INDEED. Yet, he didn't do anything to rectify the situation! 

After we paid, we waited another 20 minutes before we got our food. Even the people that ordered on the spot after us in line got their food and left before we got our food.  

Overall, I am very disappointed as I enjoy their food but honestly, this location has the worst people working there. 

PLACED THE WRONG ORDER, LACK CUSTOMER SERVICE, LONG WAIT FOR A PRE-ORDERED MEAL."}
{"text":"Let me just say that if you order a burrito from their menu, it is big! it is well prepared, and tastes great. It is a nice little place to try out. When I went there I had to save half of my burrito for the next day... I was so full from eating half. Well worth the price paid."}
{"text":"I've been to this location about 4 times since it has opened. I have always been a big fan of the shrimp burrito, but I've noticed recently they are seriously skimping on the shrimp. The burrito's itself taste great, but i mostly felt like i was eating a vegetarian burrito since there were only 4 shrimp in the whole burrito! I'm disappointed cause I really love this place."}
{"text":"i only get the halibut burrito.  it's awesome.  not too big not too small. just right"}
{"text":"Best Burritos around!  Excellent service as well.  I always get the naked lil sweet potato burrito.  It's a great portion size, fresh ingredients, and delicious!  Their music was a little too loud last time I was there, but it was a nice day so we sat on the picnic table out front.  I am becoming a regular at this spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome burritos at this place!! Honestly, it doesn't matter which one you get, they all taste fresh and amazing:) I personally love the fish one. Can't comment on the service because one of my friends / family always gets them for me. Whenever they do however I cannot wait until they get home!"}
{"text":"If you want a burrito without any particular flair or uniqueness, this is your spot.  Burrito Boyz is basically a fast(ish) food shop that happens to churn out bland burritos, period.

If you want Mexican food, move along.  If you want a real Mexican burrito, move along.  If you want a generic burrito to satisfy your hunger AND you happen to be in this area, come inside.  Otherwise, Toronto offers up better burritos elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love the halibut burrito - but I have to say the small is really filling, and I say this as someone with a great appetite!

Don't be put off by the lines as they do go quickly. If you're in a rush call ahead.
Cash only is a bit of a pain."}

{"text":"This is a great place to get a very satisfying lunch. We often take our burritos over to Samuel Smith Park, by George Brown and enjoy a great picnic. The staff is courteous without ever being cloying. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price, but both times I've gone, the music is so loud, you can't have a conversation. This is too bad, because I'd like to bring people there, but I know they wouldn't want to stay."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz is a city staple! Local or Tourist, these guys were one of first to bring the burrito style meals to Toronto in a real meaningful way. The experience of dining at a BB is the same as it has always been. Loud, a bit confusing, and always delicious. Portions are a good size and quality is top notch. Personally the Halibut is still my favourite, but everything is pretty much awesome.

My fav. locations are Adelaide or College st, but they're pretty all the same. They recently added a counter only location on Dundas East right near the Eatons Centre. On a warm day I order there and eat over at the Ryerson Fountain area... great for people watching.

All in... the food is good, the price is right, and it's a damn tasty burrito."}
{"text":"I work in the building across the street so I often order for pick up. The food is good and fairly priced however I am very disappointed to say that on several occasions my orders were not ready and they had different excuses every time. Nobody was willing to take ownership and accountability. I like the food and the price however after 4 incidents where my food wasn't ready I will no longer be returning because it already takes me 5 minutes to walk there and 5 to walk back, and I simply don't have 10-15 minutes to wait for my burrito to be ready. I call ahead of time for a reason."}
{"text":"This is by far the best 'to go' meal out there.  Late night hours and gluten free options.   Always tasty.  Excellent customer service on the phone and in person.  A clean operation."}
{"text":"This place is very nice, don't think that if it is budget then the food sucks, it's very delicious. They have happy hours so I managed to buy two big chicken burritos for $14.60 ! Also keep in mind that this place has only about 6 small tables so I think they are mostly take outs."}
{"text":"It's always hopping and for good reason. I recently tried the sweet potato burrito - surprisingly VERY good."}
{"text":"Always very good food, and very good value for money!

It can take a few minutes for the food to be made (but it's always hot off the grill!) so leave an extra 5-7 minutes. If you're in a rush, you can always order online, which I usually do."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me, best burritos ever.
There are many locations around the city in comparison to them originally only having limited locations.  There is no difference in taste regardless of which location I go to.

It is a must try."}
{"text":"By far the stingiest of all the Burrito Boyz franchises out there in terms of toppings and ingredients. Really frustrating to go into this place having been to many other locations knowing your order no matter what it is will be far less than what you're used to if you enjoy Burrito Boyz. This location for me happens to be really close to home so I'm unfortunately bound to it more often than not but it's gotten to the point where I'll just ignore this location and go elsewhere and be happy with what I paid for. Overall it is run professionally and it is clean but the staff here have been trained to be cheap ass when it comes to making your food compared to other much more generous locations."}
{"text":"Had the beef burrito with everything. Pretty good, not the best that I've had, but better than fat bastard burrito."}
{"text":"I still haven't had a better burrito anywhere . Too good! Quesedillas are good too but some room for improvement there. Always call
Ahead as this is a busy spot"}
{"text":"Decent Burritos here. Service is unfortunately pretty slow when it gets really busy, otherwise it's ok. 

I think the quality of meat and the freshness of the vegetables is a little lacking compared to other burrito places I go to.

I go often enough but I never seem to see the same employees twice. I don't know what that means, but it's frustrating not to see any familiar faces.

Best part of it all - I love how they give away free rice right before closing time!"}
{"text":"Have the people giving this place good reviews actually ever had a Mexican burrito??   Ok, even if I accept that it's some strange Canadian fusion cuisine (burrito sauce that tastes like a salad vinaigrette?!), it's still doesn't taste good.  I would have expect some Mexican flavours, spices, seasoning but I got nothing.  Bland veggies topped with bland meat and smothered with bland salsa and some salad dressing aka \"burrito sauce\".  I don't think they even use salt.  Most disappointing naked burrito bowl."}
{"text":"After having heard about this place I came over with a company co worker and must admit this place is pretty awesome. The food was absolutely wonderful and tasty and service was fast. Will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"Two words: SPEED DIAL.

If you call ahead, you don't need to stand in line.  Even if you're right outside! Just pick up your cell phone and watch as the long line of people stand there, while your order is taken right away.  Score!  

And yeah, damn, best burritos in town.  Plus the staff are awesome and as a bonus, they spell \"napkinz\" with a \"z\".  Which you just can't say about other places!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here twice on our recent trip to Toronto.  To cut to the chase, we loved this place.  First, they offered a gluten free option for my wife who has food allergies.  And apart from that, the ingredients were fresh and the price was right.  The only criticisms that I would have are that the place was pretty tight with not a lot of seating, the steak was a bit on the chewy side, and we both wish they offered queso."}
{"text":"Ordered both large  steak burrito and the chicken and shrimp burrito. The taste is alright, kinda bland really (coming from mom's Latino cooking) never had burrito boys and was starving so decided to try it out! Very filling though. The place is busy at almost all times so be prepared to wait a bit. The car parking is very tight, it's really limited."}
{"text":"I like this location better then the tiny space in Port credit.  Im not a fan of their tofu but i do love the sweet potato option. The staff are great but I would suggest turning down the music especially when trying to getting the orders right.  For the most part they get it right the order that is but when calling a head over the phone sometimes there is small mistakes.  Another then the noise level I love that they have a sit down area."}
{"text":"What can I say...they are always on point in person and over the phone!!!  I know this location works for them because I have been coming here since 2010 but I pray one day they will upgrade the size of the building. ...like just buy the whole  property please!! It would be nice to sit and enjoy the whole environment instead of buying and rushing out."}
{"text":"This is my fav. Burrito place, even better than those in Cali, and they have LOADS of burrito choices!

SHRIMP Burrito Rocks!!! Oh sooooo juicy....hehe"}
{"text":"I've been back.

I got another steak burrito, but got it mild, and with no hot peppers.

A world of difference.  I could taste the burrito, and can now actually recommend this to the world.

Not only was the burrito better tasting, but the service was very helpful in accommodating the less-spicy request.  After adding the (less) hot sauce, she added more sauces to mix it in an mask it even more."}
{"text":"I've always loved sandwich/\"wrappy\"-type things (i.e. Shawarma, falafel, Gyro's, etc..etc.) , but, I never understood the Burrito craze that was sweeping the city! That being said, I figured I would try Burrito Boyz over the weekend, as I was dying for a snack, and didn't feel like cooking. I've seen some pretty negative comments about other B.B. locations, but, i have to say, I was pretty impressed! 
B.B's was clean, the toppings/ingredients looked fresh, and the service was fast and fairly courteous (as good as you can expect from someone that \"may\" have been out boozing the night before their shift!).
I opted for the chicken burrito with a variety of toppings, and it was very tasty!
My immediate thoughts were \"Crap, i was wrong\" (tough for me to admit, especially when it comes to food!) and \"I've been missing out!\"
In true, caveman fashion, I selected the LARGE size, and, although I'm a pretty big guy, it was almost too much food! (I can't believe I just typed that...)
Not sure how often I would have this, but, it was quick, tasty, and a good-sized portion, so I'll definitely visit Burrito Boyz again!

Tips - 
1) Try the SMALL (I've heard it's big enough...)
2) Don't \"unwrap\" it. It's a burrito for god's sake, like a shawarma/falafel, you likely won't like what you see inside, and it's just going to fall apart on your lap!
3) You HAVE to try the halibut! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Bad service, food isn't amazing 

And also 1/2 pound calamari for 10$ when you get 6 pieces are you serious?"}
{"text":"I love Burrito boys but the wait at this location during the rush is a bit of a pain.  I highly recommend the food, but suggest avoiding high volume times."}
{"text":"Just finished my exercise and was looking for a place to eat late night with a fellow foodie partner, and we decided to give this a try. Liked the colourful board menu, and they also have a small patio in the front.  =)

I asked the diff between a small and large portion and its the weight of 1lb to 1 and three quarter weight. I decided to order a small steak burritos for my gf to go. Toppings:  whole wheat tortilla with beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, mild salsa, guacamole (YUM), burrito sauce, and sour cream...! I know its hard to believe all these toppings free with the burritos...SWEET!!! It weighed a pound or so at least...

I got myself the large Halibut and Shrimp combined!!! I didn't know I could do that until my fellow foodie bud did that, so I copied him =P If you want that special too, tell them you know 'Taz' and they will give you that order...=P Joking!!!
The great thing about the double dip is they charged which ever cost more which was the halibut at $9.73, but the shrimp was $7.96, so they pick the higher number. I thought I would get charged extra, but I didn't soooo that's pretty SAFE!!! (DOUBLE LUCKY)

Toppings on this bad boy: Beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, mild salsa, guacamole (YUM AGAIN), burrito sauce, sour cream, sriracha chili sauce!!!

Brought these two babies home and my gf and I shared...Her steak was good, but not impressive...We both definitely agreed that mine was the BEST! The halibut is deep fried, but the batter was not too much compared to fish. All the toppings I add-on was spot on, and the sriracha chili sauce did justice to my burrito!!!

I would come back to this place whenever I need a good snack to fill myself...Surprisingly I didn't get full from my large burrito and had to eat more at home, but it was a good snack for under $10 a burrito...Next time maybe I'll try another burrito joint at Kensington Market area..."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and order a chicken quesadillas ( comes with 2 sides ) $7.31 + $1.99 for a combo that comes with a drink and Tortilla Chips ( select 1 side ).

For those who haven't been here a side is pretty much their condiments that goes along with what your ordering and there are 3 choices ( Burrito sauce, sour cream and salsa ) I thought my Tortilla's side wasn't given to me therefore I purchased a Guacamole for $1 ( VERY EXPENSIVE FOR A WEE BIT OF Guac )

Overall the food is great, very large portion. I wasn't able to finish my quesadillas or chips. I would love to come back and try their Naked ( which is everything except the tortilla )"}
{"text":"Soo there food is amazing,service is great.no waste manz here. Place a little blem but food is A1"}
{"text":"Great chicken bowls and good prices.  Small place to eat and always really busy during lunch do it's best to grab and go.   I once got cold chicken during lunch which was strange but other times it's always been good."}
{"text":"This place would do well without my four stars so I'll give it a 3.5. I'd been a couple of times when it was a smaller joint under smokes poutinerie, where smokes burrito is now. The wait times were long then, but now that it's a bigger place I think it's gotten a lot better during the day. HOWEVER on weekends when everyone's craving drunk food it's still packed af in there because it's one of the few places downtown that's open until 4am (because pfft, Toronto). 

Menu-wise the chicken quesadillas and the naked burritos are the best. Even the empty corners of the tortilla are good because they go hard on the cheese; I live for them cheezez. Also I always ask for more cilantro as I'm an exotic asian girl and they PACK it with extra cilantro leaving me extra satisfied. 

The last time I went, I pre-ordered by phone after being put on hold for about seven minutes, waited the 20 minutes that the employee told me it was going to take for the food, and waited an extra 20 minutes at the place because drunk orders were too piled up. Despite this, the reason I keep going back is that I live really close by and that I try to avoid Smokes (people working there are really nice; unfortunately food is horrible), but if I were visiting dt from afar I would find somewhere else more special or rather go to Chipotle. 

Conclusion: If it weren't for the dirty tables, the waiting time, and the missing cutlery in my takeout I'd give it a 4.6."}
{"text":"Chipotle just has a better spice on their chicken than Burrito Boyz. It's just that simple for me. Also, the chicken chunks are too big in the Burritos. I don't want to come out with a huge piece of chicken every few bites. 

Pluses are that Burrito Boyz is a good value.

For some reason calling ahead to order means a slower experience in store. Figure that one out."}
{"text":"The halibut burrito is fantastic . Very good quality and very tasty , large piece of halibut that fills the entire tortilla  . Many choices for toppings very fresh .

 Unfortunately I find the beef to be very low quality . Large chunks of gristle , and lacking a quality beef taste  . Very disappointing , I'd pay extra if cost is an issue for purchasing the quality beef . 

Remaining competitive at a cost of quality is a very bad trade off . Shame really , the brand and store setup is a lot better that mucho burrito and has far more potential ."}
{"text":"Heaven on earth. I love this place minus the having to pay for parking. 

I always get the shrimp burrito and it's filling and delicious and always the way I want it. The burritos are made to order and the staff is friendly and helpful. I always see a ton of people getting the fish burrito which looks delicious and hopefully I'll get the courage to try it soon. It's around $10 but definitely worth every penny. It tastes so fresh and melts in my mouth. Just writing this review makes me want to go back and eat more burritos. There is seriously no competition between them and Fat Bastards or Mucho Burrito. This is always número uno."}
{"text":"Ok so after reading all the reviews, I took the bait and tried Burrito Boyz.  Meh, had better.  Sure after clubbing all night you may think that what you're eating is quality food but during the day not so much.  My burrito was soggy and was not wrapped well so it was falling apart.  The service was no good, they made me feel like they were doing me a favour by serving me the food, I don't except 5 start service but a simple hey would be nice.  End of the day not sure what the big fuss is all about."}
{"text":"This place has the best burritos! My whole family loved it. From my mom who couldn't stop talking about how good it is, to my younger brother; the picky eater. 
On the wall you can see all the rave reviews from various newspaper; and for good reason. From the outside I wouldn't think about going inside; but it is amazing. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had it for the first time at ribfest & it was absolutely amazing! The veggies were crisp, fresh & everything was warm, melted & delicious. The people working the tent were also super friendly & had great customer service. We were waiting over 15 min since they had run out of burritos but once they came the girl was nice enough to give it to us for $5 plus a drink. Thought that was super nice of her. Will definitely get one again in the future"}
{"text":"The food tastes great but the serving size is poor! I asked my husband to bring me home a bean and cheese burrito bowl tonight around 6. When I opened the box in anticipation, I asked him if they forgot the beans because I couldn't find them! There was such a small amount hidden underneath the rest of it all. If you order a bean bowl you don't expect to basically get a salad. Also, even though I got everything on it including guacamole, the food disappointingly didn't fill up the box, but sat on one side with some empty space on the other. Why so cheap?"}
{"text":"A bit of a wait for lunch but worth it. This place is fantastic for what it is.

It doesn't try to be fancy. You're definitely not taking a date here. But you will stand in that lunch line for those delicious burritos. Every time I go here it's packed and for good reason. The burritos are some of the best you can get. They're almost always putting out a consistent meal which is why many people come here regularly for their lunches. 

One thing that could be improved is the customer service. There's a lot of college-aged kids working behind the counter and they're too chatty with each other to care about your order. You have to be loud and repeat yourself"}
{"text":"Not a fan. This chain feels like the \"Subway\" of burrito chains. Very bland and generic compared to Chipotole or some of the other chains. Needs improvement."}
{"text":"YOOOOOOOO this location opened up super close to Ryerson which is amazing considering the next option would be Adelaide which is quite a way off. It's a smaller place, no seating, but it makes for a quick stop and considering many eating here are commuters it's whatever ya feel??

But yeah, I got a large chicken bowl and it did not disappoint. They filled the bowl practically all the way with beans and rice and put generous helpings of everything else (veggies, guac, etc). Only downside chicken was pre made and chilling in a container so they scooped some into my bowl ( prob my fault since I went at 9 pm on a weekday) but yeah! All in all, never disappoints. And this location is lit. So check it out. 

-1 star for not fresh chicken lol."}
{"text":"Love the place and love the food. Been going to this location for a few years now and never have it been so turned off as I was tonight. My wife and i ordered our dinner and on our way out asked for extra burrito sauce. Not knowing they charge for it which I would've been more than happy to pay for a young lady working behind the counter was so rude in approaching me with the fact being they charge for the sauce. That being said and the way she said it and the tone she said it with really turned me off so I respectfully told her she could keep it and that I didn't want it. Again love the place and th food but won't be going back for a while."}
{"text":"Best burritos in town !! Gluten free halibut burrito ... Yummy !! Great service too ..."}
{"text":"Bland and sludge-like mush all rolled up in a toasted tortilla.  In fact, the best thing I could say about it was how neatly the cook packed and folded my chicken burrito."}
{"text":"The best burritos in town, nothing short of amazing. Anyone who likes food must try this, they have vegetarian options so something for everyone. However I can only attest to the steak, and chicken burritos which were amazing. Don't expect fast food speeds as it does take some time to make, but the quality justifies this. Service is across the counter but the staff are friendly enough. It is open very late and is populated by club hooligans after a certain hour."}
{"text":"Service today sucked big time.  Took an unusual long time for my naked burrito, 15 minutes.  There was only one girl at the topping station, the cashier was just standing around in between orders."}
{"text":"WOW!
2,200 miles away from home to taste if not the best chicken burrito I have ever had!

Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy. But the wait in line is worth it. Man-size burritos for a big appetite. You have to know when fireman cops and bikers eat somewhere it's got to be great"}
{"text":"i go here wayyyy too often as i'm always hungry after work (11pm ish..) and burritos are nicely warm and filling. I use to get a large and could never finish it so i started getting the small and it's pretty much the same as the large! just with a tad less.. so go for the small! u'll be satisfied

so far i've tried the chicken, beef, and most recently haddock which was reallllly yummy. I think i'll try the halibut next time as i have heard amazing things about it. It's never too long of a wait and the staff are very nice. also guac is free! (other places usually charge for it)

go and get yourself one =)"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST BURRITO IN TORONTO. It's difficult and somewhat awkward explaining to someone that your favourite lunch in the world is a fish burrito, but that's exactly the predicament I frequently find myself in. I used to go for the chicken until a colleague wisely guided me toward the halibut. I was apprehensive at first but wow, what an incredible meal. With the halibut your stomach doesn't feel nearly as weighed down as with the chicken or beef. Then there is the construction. A burrito should be built and folded in such a way that you can eat it without getting a single drop on your plate or your hands. If you do, then either it wasn't constructed right or you need to improve your burrito eating skills. Burrito Boyz always builds their burritos right, so if you spill any, it's your fault!"}
{"text":"Fuck, so good.  But don't ever let a trainee make your burrito, because I promise you, you'll spend nearly your whole lunch hour waiting for it only to get back to your office and realize that on your walk back your burrito has quietly opened up and spilled all over the inside of the bag.

NOT COOL, BURRITO BOYZ.  (That's not going to stop me from going back at all, of course. Just, maybe I'll get a pre-made burrito when I don't recognize the counter staff.)"}
{"text":"Staff are so rude and just because I am more calorie conscious they made fun of me and got really rude because I asked for no sauce. I actually got made fun of because of my preferences and I felt like this is a potential discrimination lawsuit ."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite spot to grab lunch while I'm at school. I usually order a Small Chicken Burrito ($7.31) and it hits the spot just right. I can usually eat quite a bit, but I'm well-satisfied after a small which is nice. 

One thing to note: there is no seating in this 
Burrito Boyz location so you'll have to get it to go. There are benches in Dundas Square across the road."}
{"text":"Two years on and we still get burritos or quesadillas 2-3 times a month. The sweet potato quesadilla is delicious and surprisingly filling. The shop can get crowded in the summer, so we bring our stuff home to eat."}
{"text":"I went to this place because of the good review in general.  But I was disappointed! The service was very slow even though there was only one person in front of me. The server definitely didn't want to be there! 
I ordered a burrito bowl and the portion was extremely small! My take out container was maybe half full!  And they charge extra for guacamole !! 
I gave them 3 stars because the taste of the food was after all good! But definitely not what people say that they give big portions and good for your money and great service!!
I may try another location in the future!"}
{"text":"Not pleased at all, no noodles, no chips, big hunks of tomato that taste a little off. I am a huge burrito fan however will not be returning here. I normally go to fat bastards across the street but thought I would give burrito boys a shot. Don't make my mistake."}
{"text":"Came here on a friday night, service was fast and the toppings were fresh. Just that the steak/beef was kind overcooked for my burrito. Everything else was good."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this chain by a friend and I very much enjoy their food. The price is right and the quality is great. The staff is very friendly. The small burritos look like what a large burrito would look like, that is plenty of enough to fill you right up. Great taste, I love all of their ingredients. Will definitely try it again. :)"}
{"text":"We used to come to this place all the time and it was fine and a standard burrito boyz experience. But now apparently new owners bought the place and they're so stingy! They charge for guac now which is whatever, but my brother got a large burrito but tell me how there was 20 grains of rice?  No exaggeration after she put the beans and rice it was so sheer you could still see the tortilla. Really disappointing, never coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Love this place for a good and hearty meal without alot of carbs if customized right. You can put whatever toppings you want on it and it can taste different each time. The staff is great and friendly. will always return again."}
{"text":"Love this place!

If you are a fan of eating burritos that you can cradle in your arms like a wee baby, then this is your joint!!

The burritos are huge and abundant with deelish toppings (rice, guac, salsa, jalapeños, sour cream, cheese, beans). I personally love the half chicken half steak but the Halibut is to die for!!!

The only reason I will go downtown to a club these days,  is so that I can get my Burrito Boy on at 2am. Yah the line is long but its all for a good reason."}
{"text":"Tastiest bespoke burritos in town!  My favourites are the Halibut and the veg burritos, but they have a wider selection including steak, chicken, shrimp and then quesadillas.  There's a system there, so follow the flow and remember your number."}
{"text":"Great location of the B Boyz chain.  Service is quick and prices are good. 

I alwaysbget the veggie meat burrito. Really nice to have that option. Everything taste fresh  and it's a regular place for me to visit."}
{"text":"I got the large halibut and shrimp with all the extras.  I had a tough time finishing it but it would have been disrespect not to finish it. From the first bite to the last was a amazing mixture of meat and veggies.  The best part of this mixture was that you find decent sized shrimps throughout the burrito.  They are like little nuggets placed in the correct places to please. Definitely going to return to try the chicken and steak."}
{"text":"I have nothing but LOVE for this place. I usually call in my order and its ready in 15, walk in, pay and receive. 

I almost have to run home because of the anticipation of eating  this bad boy. Best burrito , best service. Please never leave me burrito boyz!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. I love it for what it is. Cheap burrito place, nothing fancy about it. Just fresh ingredients, put together well.....for the perfect burrito experience. 

Lets face it......what else do you need when you have that burrito craving????

Also a great place for some funny late night drunk people experiences!"}
{"text":"I get that this place has a line up. I don't mind waiting for good food but I waited longer than usual only to get a quesadilla that was burnt black on the bottom. Didn't realize until I got back to work. Very disappointed. Sent an email but never got a reply."}
{"text":"The halibut burrito was amazingly delicious both times I had it.  The only issue I have is the time it took both times.  There was only one client ahead of me and I was there for at least 10 minutes in line."}
{"text":"Great Burritos,  fast and friendly service.  Regular client   of the downtown location,  first time at this location and very impressed.  Portions are great and price is just right ."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars. The food was absolutely fantastic though. I had a steak burrito, extra spicy and it was PACKED with meat, that was smoked just great. However, the service was not that impressive. I understand that they were busy, but I ordered my food 30 mins prior to new customers walking in and out of the joint, only for them to realize that they forgot my order of steak burritos, so I had to wait a total of 45 minutes to receive my food. This so far has happened twice to me. I love the food, and will DEFINITELY go back, but I suggest ordering your food via telephone maybe 40 minutes before going to the place to pick up your food."}
{"text":"Fantastic burritos at this location. Awesome staff. Make sure to call ahead of time and pick up (around 15 minutes wait usually) because they are almost always jam packed with customers."}
{"text":"Probably the best burrito place I been to always fresh toppings and meat always never a complaint. Down the road there's a fat bastards and it's just not as fresh meat dry. Top place for a burrito burrito boys"}
{"text":"Came here last night closer to night time and received some pretty horrible service. I've been to this location before and it hasn't been incredible , but last night was horrible. First of, this rude short haired Asian girl angrily takes my order. When I finally got my food, the chicken was cold and undercooked. Not impressed. 

Not coming back to this location due to rude employees and subpar food."}
{"text":"The best halibut burrito in town! The place is always busy and there is always a little bit of a wait. They do take orders over the phone at I usually call 15 minutes before hand and my order is always waiting for me by the time I get there. Guacamole is free which is a nice bonus as compared to places like Chipotle that charge $2.10 extra. I wouldn't recommend ordering their naked burrito - it's okay bit not nearly as good as their burrito. Burritos is what they do best!"}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Especially great after clubbing! I recommend the shrimp burrito"}
{"text":"Good dinner for a good price! Especially good value considering prices of places nearby.  They should fix their door though, it makes a horrendous noise"}
{"text":"This place is great! You can enjoy this place even if you don't like spicy food. The burritos are very filling-just half of the burrito and I was already full! And so tasty, with lots of fillings. The only reason that I didn't give this place 5 stars was because they did not have a bathroom, so you can't wash your hands."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite place to get a burrito. I really recommend the Halibut Burrito with everything! It's absolutely delicious. Not bad pricing on their food iether. I've been a fan of this place since my friend recommended it to me!"}
{"text":"Unlimited toppings.. Need I say more?? You can fill the burrito as much as you want and it doesn't cost any extra. The serving is good for 2 lunches for me, I'm pretty tiny though. Such a good place if you want the delicious Mexican flavours of a burrito."}
{"text":"As a recent transplant to Toronto from San Francisco, I was on the lookout for a taqueria to satisfy my burrito craving. Reading some of the reviews that Burrito Boyz had received I had my hopes up when I went into their Lakeshore location and ordered my first burrito. All I can say is that what they are pushing out should not be called a burrito, as it was like nothing I've ever tasted in North America.

 First of all I was taken back by the process that someone has to go through just to get a burrito. You pay first then get a plastic number card, followed by a toothpick, a paper bag, and some writing with a china marker. Why you pay first before you pick your ingredients is a little odd. Part of ordering a burrito is customizing it to your exact needs. Maybe a little more rice, or no rice, extra guac, or salsa, or whatever you like. But that was not a problem because you don't get to choose really, they deal in tablespoons where it should be cups, followed by an over abundance of things that should not even be on a burrito. They are not only using the wrong cheese they are using a processed cheddar and mozzarella cheese from a bag no less. The salsa has to be from a jar as it was tasteless and bland, and why they offer raw tomatoes as opposed to authentic salsas is just inexcusable. After all of this your burrito has to sit on a grill for 5 minutes while the two tablespoons of avocado and one tablespoon of sour cream cook. 
    It's rare that you have to wait very long for a burrito once you've placed your order. Except in the case of where they cook the meat to order...so good! Anyway.... Burritos should be fast, fresh, and cheap. While the price I paid was not bad, fast it was not, I could not imagine how long it would take if it was busy. To top it off what you end up with after all of this is a tasteless improvement to a taco bell burrito with no trace of any authentic spices or flavor.
 I would suggest that the owner's take some time and travel to see the many different variants on how to make a proper burrito. Not only would they be providing a better product, they would be able to serve more people faster and provide a somewhat healthier alternative to other types of fast food available in Toronto."}
{"text":"There's one reason to go to Burrito Boyz - the food. Hands down the best burrito I've ever had, and they are consistently great with their food, especially given the price.

However, the Adelaide St location is always slow - often taking 30 mins from walking in to receiving my take out order. I'm by no means an expert, but there are some very obvious inefficiencies and bottle-necks in their process.

I've also noticed that there is a fair amount of cross-contamination of food on the front line (corn in the salsa, beans in the guac, etc.). I'm sure this is as a result of how busy they are, but is definitely something to consider if you have allergies.

But let's face it, a good burrito is hard to find, and this is it."}
{"text":"Awesome burritos here at this location. finally one closer to home! Great service and great food. Definitely bang for your buck.  Definitely coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"Visits 5+ 

This location is friendly, upbeat & food is fresh and tasty. Don't be fooled by the small place, minimal parking & long lineups. IT's worth the wait. 

The ingredients are fresh and is cooked to order. I wouldn't go as far to say this is classic Mexican cooking, but is pretty damn good when you have a burrito craving. I wouldn't drive from Richmond hill if it wasn't. 

Recommendations: Halibut Burrito & Steak Burrito 

This review has been simple & quick, 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most legendary burrito joints this side of Mississauga. Their prices have gone up over time, but that's to be expected when minimum wage goes up (inflation).

This place will not short you of quantity. They pack every burrito to the brim.

The Halibut burrito is the burrito worth Coming for. There's no additional charge for guacamole or salsa in your burrito and the meat quantity is respectfully wholesome.

Their steak burritos are like a cross of ground beef and flank steak trims. They are still really good..

The hot sauce is on point. If you get a mild flavoured one like halibut or haddock, go light on the hot sauce as putting a line or two can be a bit overpowering. Whenever I order a steak, I get a couple of lines of hot sauce. The only downside of the hot sauce is it somehow finds it's way to one corner of the burrito. 

Haven't tried the calamari but those are next on my list."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! Got the naked sweet potato and my sister got the steak burrito..both of us were extremely happy with our meals. A lot depends on whether you like their selection of toppings and sauces, which we do!  Their hot sauce is especially strong but some, like my sister, can't do without it. For me, I'm happy with the flavours from their refried pinto beans, burrito sauce and sour cream since I don't eat spicy food.

This location was extremely busy at dinner time, as I imagine all their locations would be. That said, the staff handled the orders that were pouring in with ease. I've never seen so many people work so well in such a small space! It was like watching a finely tuned machine. 

The space itself is a cute little shack but too small and crowded to enjoy eating in. Definitely more popular for takeout. Parking is a bit of a hit or miss since it's in Port Credit, but since it's located on a quieter street off Lakeshore there usually is street parking. They also have a small attached parking lot.

I can see why Burrito Boyz is a cult favourite among its fans - count us in as well!"}
{"text":"I went to Burrito Boyz on a weekday evening while there was a bit of freezing rain, and the restaurant was nearly empty ! We didn't have to wait in line.

I was quite pleasantly surprised at the variety of vegetarian options that were offered. For this reason, I will definitely be coming back! The prices are also very good, and the portions are huge!

The downside to my visit was unfortunately the customer service. After waiting a good while to get our meals, we got wrong orders. I went back to politely explain that we had ordered something else, and the woman behind the counter made it obvious that she was annoyed. We ended up having to go back to the counter a second time when we realized they had forgotten something!

Bottom line: we got delicious burritos at a good price. The positives outweigh the negatives!"}
{"text":"Great burrtito does not mean i will let go bad customer service!! Do not take ph orders if do not know how to take one.. I will never return to this location or perhaps the chain of customer service is so bad of burrito boyz.. Very very disappointed"}
{"text":"I came here last week, and was supremely disappointed. I've been to many Burrito Boyz, so I know not to expect anything stellar, but his location is just absurdly bad. 

Old ingredients, including dried up crumbly bits of what they try to call cilantro; absolutely disgusting beans that were liquid (as in they poured them into my tortilla like water), and the absolute WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I got yelled about for wanting to watch her make my burrito, obviously I didn't budge on that. Then of course she goes to take my burrito to the grill with missing ingredients, and then yelled at me again when I requested she add them. 

I'm so disappointed, as this location is so close to me, it was going to be my go to spot. Will not be back."}
{"text":"These burritos are hella spicy I usually get 5 lines because I love the burn. The hot sauce that they use is great its spicy but doesn't interfere With the taste. I always get the chicken Or steak burritos. Next time I'm getting Halibut. This place is definatly the best in town compared to our chipotle locations and Fat Bastard."}
{"text":"Pretty good burritos and Quesadillas. Hits the spot at the end of a long day.

The ingredients are fresh. Their Fish Buritto and steak quesadilla are pretty good.

The service here is pretty friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Pretty good burritos and Quesadillas. Hits the spot at the end of a long day.

The ingredients are fresh. Their Fish Buritto and steak quesadilla are pretty good.

Just an interesting ingredient I once tried:

One time I found a strand of long blond hair in my Burrito -I'm not blond-. I was initially giddy with excitement but when the 3rd one came up I just had to ask for another Burrito. The server looked at me accusingly as if I stole his fellow server's hair using a burrito harry potter spell and stuffed it in the Burrito myself -or perhaps he thought I wasn't appreciative of the extra exotic ingredient-. Needless to say, the cashier was apologetic and wanted to give me another one and a refund. My stomach was still um..\"recovering\".. so I just asked for a refund and stuck to the college street branch instead which -much to my chagrin- doesn't serve the La Blonde burrito.

I hope they improved since I last tried it but I'm sticking to the College branch."}
{"text":"One of downtown Toronto's favorites is now in Scarborough. This place is a never fail. Chicken and steak is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"This is the worst burrito boyz location by far, expect to receive only half the amount of food the regular locations serve. I always have to order double meat and cheese whenever I go and it's STILL not as much as the other locations NORMALLY put on"}
{"text":"This place is great! their food portions are really big and guacamole is free! I always get a small naked burrito and its enough to fill me up for hours!"}
{"text":"Still the king! I don't have a burrito boyz in my home town (opening soon! thank God!) so anytime I'm in the GTA I make it a mission to get me some burrito boyz, and they never disappoint. There's a burrito place in my town (who will go unnamed) that I've been going to a lot lately and I don't think I can go back, they do everything burrito boyz doesn't, they want an extra 60 cents for guac (just on principal I'd rather throw the 60 cents on the ground after I leave than give it to them), they don't toast the burrito (panini presses are for panini's!!!!!!!!!!!), and they are sloppy with there wrapping (Dominicans posing as Cubans could do a better job...hope you get that reference:)"}
{"text":"As an update I figured its been 4 months since my review i've been happily going to other locations. But I was in a geographical bind, So I thought id try again... 

Lol with little or no customers in the store. 

 They give me half my order again....I have to ask for the rest of my order.. lol its just sad. Ill just drive over to streetsville From now on where it never happens.

Food is good ,staff is nice. they just cant get things right there and dont pay attention. Which means lack of management."}
{"text":"I have to give credit to the original Burrito Boyz, because this is where I had my first burrito, that started what has become my food obsession.

Lots has changed since that late night snack, so many years ago, but the Burrito Boyz really haven't changed in any significant way.  They're still pumping out great burritos for a decent price, and putting a smile on my face.  The ingredients are fresh, they make some good guac, and you will leave with a small brick-sized fistful of goodness.

Good standard options for your meat (or veggie), and the chicken is still my standard, though the halibut is a nice change.  Grilled with refried beans, the ingredients all seem to mingle well, and their hot sauce is just the right level of spiciness.  

Always a good option for lunch, or a later-night treat."}
{"text":"I do not understand the obsession with this place. I got the chicken naked burrito and the chicken and rice were dry. There was a lot of food but it wasn't good. it was pretty tasteless to be honest."}
{"text":"This place rivals Chino Locos for the best burrito in Toronto (I haven't tried Big Fat Burrito yet)

My whole wheat veggie bean and cheese burrito (minus the corn and jalapeños) was delightful and so, so filling. I got the small size and was full all day, plus it only set me back $5.50. Yay!!! Seriously good value for money here.

Washrooms should be avoided at all costs. Yeuch. 

Service was definitely lacking in friendliness a bit, but the burrito was pretty much perfect."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch especially if you are hungry. The staff here are wonderful. Was disappointed they are now charging additional for guacamole.. don't be a chipotle !! 

Love yah anyway"}
{"text":"Decent burritos, pretty friendly staff.
The call-ahead-the-pick up service is handy.
Not real Mexican, but tasty anyway.
The small size is HUGE, I've never attempted the large."}
{"text":"Im not a big burrito fan but I liked it and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I couldn't even begin to count how many times I've been here and not once have a had a bad meal. The chicken and sweet potato are my go to choices here. Was very surprised how tasty and filling the sweet potato actually is. The hot sauce has a nice kick to it (if you like it hot, ask for 2-3 lines of hot sauce). It can be busy at some times, but it is always worth the wait."}
{"text":"I opted for this place becauae of the high ratings on yelp and it got my expectation maybe too much high. While the ingredients and all were fresh and tasty enough, I would say it was more for the \"value for money\" place given the portion and the quality served."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Awesome burritos with the naked burrito option (salad bowl).  Protein choices everything from chicken and beef to shrimp, calamari and halibut. Lots of choice of healthy toppings, great prices and very filling. This has turned into a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Best burritos in the city.

I only get the halibut. I've tried to order the chicken, but it always comes out \"halibut\" and I'm never disappointed. Get it with everything and spicy - it's not too bad, don't worry.

Protip: avoid the line and order ahead, especially if you're having the fish or shrimp burrito"}
{"text":"I had a burrito here a couple of months back.  It was bland, underwhelming, and very forgettable.  I only remembered to write this review now as I was online writing a review for Burrito place up the street, and I was comparing Barburrito, Burrito boyz, and Burrito place."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and overall, I've had a good experience. The first time, we were greeted by a cashier who didn't appear interested in anything at all, but met with fantastic food. The second time, the staff were very friendly, but the food was less than spectacular. The third time was, for lack of a better term, the charm.

On each visit, I ordered the large burrito while my fiancee ordered the small. To the naked eye, there doesn't seem to be much difference in size, but the cook could tell just by feel - pretty impressive. I ended up finishing my fiancee's twice, so the small was filling for her, but the large wasn't enough for me.

My favorite thing about Burrito Boyz has to be the fresh chopped jalapenos. The world needs more chopped jalapenos. The only downside I can think of is while the guacamole is great, I feel it overtakes the other ingredients.

So far, it's my favorite place to get take-out burritos in the city, and it's probably going stay that way for a while."}
{"text":"Just on the burrito experience, it was great. It's huge for the price and worth it. They toast it up to seal it in which makes it not soggy. They do lack in flavour though. The steak was lacking the beef or any flavour, same with the chicken. They fill it up with beans and rice, but at least they don't charge extra for guac. 

TLDR: Huge portion, worth the price, but lacks flavour."}
{"text":"I used to have an office on Peter Street downtown ... right across from the original Borrito Boyz.  It was literally the basement of a victorian house.  But man were there ever lineups for the burritos and they were tremendous for sure...  SO  when I saw a franchise one on Yonge Street North relatively close by I was in heaven.   I don't know what it is but this location just keeps hitting homeruns.  Never have had a bad or even mediocre burrito .  For me it is all about consistency and these guys are truly amazing.  They even blow away the original store on Peter Street.  Not sure what it is but there are a few superstars who work there who are just amazing to deal with.  Healthy portions and no skimping on toppings (fillings?)... super nice kids who work there.   All around great.  Thankfully never insanely busy when I go there but even if it is a bit busy they blast through stuff quickly.  Lucky so far with parking but I guess as they get more popular it may be a bit more challenging to park.  Any way you slice it this specific location SMOKES the competition and I have been to all the other pseudo burrito places.  SUPERB"}
{"text":"This is my local Burrito Boyz location. The quality and friendly service are great here.
They're fast and efficient, and keep the food area very clean.
The only complaint I would have is whenever I've phoned in an order for pickup, there's always something wrong with my order (either something added or missing, etc).
So I prefer to just order at the restaurant and wait for it to be made.
Would recommend this spot if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the US for a few years and the general options for chain burrito joints were Chipotle or Qdoba. Since moving back to Canada I've found there weren't any dominant burrito chains here and I think I've only seen one Chipotle in the GTA (near Eaton Centre). But I do see A LOT of imitations all over the city so it can be intimidating on picking the right one. Here's where Yelp comes in and helps, seems like the general consensus is Burrito Boyz and I'm jumping right onto that band wagon. I honestly prefer this over the big US chains. Major difference for me is that the burritos are grilled and they have fish on the menu (I always get the halibut). You tell em how spicy you want your burrito and what fixings you like or don't like and the burrito master does the work and you just wait until your burrito is ready. Great place for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"Just had burrito boy veggie bowl. Rice was hard and the food was bland not much taste. I would definetly recommend chipotle the serving is better especially lemon rice very tasty I would definetly give that three stars. Not good Mexican food definetly Chipotle."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Fresh ingredients and very clean establishment.  Had the small chicken whole wheat with all the fixings. 
First time at this location. The steps down to the washrooms are very steep and very old. Be careful! 
Will be back to enjoy another burrito."}
{"text":"You can't make a good burrito unless you know what a good burrito tastes like. I think all the employees of Burrito Boyz should take a trip south of the  border, spend a week by Mexican Border eating burritos (going down to Mexico is not safe) or maybe BB should hire some people with background in Mexican food. So I had the steak burrito and my friend had the halibut. We tried hard to finish our meal but we couldn't even eat half. Having lived in the states ( a few years in a Hispanic area) I can tell you this is not what a burrito should taste like. No offense anyone. This is just my personal opinion."}
{"text":"This place is not big and packed with people. The service is good. The staff suggested me to choose all the topping since this is my first time trying Mexican food.
Ordered chicken quesadilla. Huge portion. Thick layer of cheese and a lot of chicken. I felt fulfilled. There were two toppings. Since I chose no spicy. They are kind of tasteless. 
Overall personally, Mexican food is not my thing. Tons of stuff mixed stuff made it hard to enjoy the original flavor of the ingredient. But still a nice place to go for people with low budget and longing for stomach-fulfilled."}
{"text":"Came to this place base on Yelp reviewers.  Bought some for family to try out before heading back to California since relatives don't know much about Mexican food.  
Food - 4.5 starts
Service - 4.5 starts
(we like Burrito Boyz quesadilla better than burrito.  Burrito is still good, don't get me wrong)
Over all, I would come back to Burrito Boyz if I ever come to visit relatives in city of North York, ON."}
{"text":"I went during a busy lunch rush and ended up waiting for about 20 minutes for said burrito. The Burrito itself wasn't too bad. I ordered chicken and they ended up giving me someone elses order with beef, which still was fine. 

They use a ticket system so you'd assume it would be fool proof but I guess not. 

For the price and wait I don't think I'd make this place a regular spot to eat though. Seems a little too gimmicky. And there's very limited seating, def a grab and go place."}
{"text":"All I have to say. Halibut Burrito. I went after a recommendation from a co-worker and it has been my favourite menu choice since. 

Burrito boyz is great for a few reasons. Fresh and simple ingredients. They grill the burritos really well and there are lots of great toppings. 

I have never had a bad experience at Burrito Boyz aside from a huge wait at lunch time. The staff is super friendly when I have visited and fast. I try to go every 2 weeks or so. 

If you need a burrito fix, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Bland. Totilla was kinda burnt though why would a burrito go back on the stove to be closed if it's wrapped correctly? It made the veggies soggy. IF I go again I won't get veggies in my burrito. 

Good point: The staff was nice,place is clean and its got lots of drink options."}
{"text":"After eating at many burrito places, this place definitely is not on the top of my list.  Food was ok nothing to brag about but have had much better at other restaurants. Service was good but next time please dont be so cheap with the beef.  Overall this burrito restaurant deserves two stars on my books."}
{"text":"This place is OK, just OK. Their burritos are big and reasonably priced. They season their meat well but the other ingredients leave something to be desired. Bright green guacamole, highly processed cheese. Great drunk food, but a culinary experience this is not."}
{"text":"Great big portions, good price (they don't charge extra for guacamole which is a good sign of value to me), tasty food and good service. No wonder they are so busy! 

Also they have a great student special (I think it was less than $5 for a burrito and pop with ID)."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times with the following experiences:

1 - Walked in and ordered a naked burrito.  This location was not busy at all at that time, but for some reason, they were tossing on the toppings in supersonic speed.  Nobody wants to see their food made in a rushed and sloppy manner, nor is making a burrito ultra-fast an impressive trait.  Take the time to make it properly and with basic care.

2 - Ordered over the phone - Naked chicken Burrito.  Picked up the order, and when I got home, there was no chicken.  Called the store back, and they said they would replace the order (I was not going to drive 15 minutes to get another order.)  They did take my name down for a future refund.

This is reflective of this location only.  I have been to other locations (Mississauga) and it's great."}
{"text":"This location used to be the bomb, but I have no idea what's going on lately :( Place orders for pickup and get home to find something has been messed up, or get a completely wrong order. They're good about offering some kind of credit, but you know, shouldn't be happening so frequently in the first place, big inconvenience, blah blah. Don't know what's happened to the taste either - downtown locations are so much better! I've worked in food service and believe me I get it and I hardly ever review anything, good or bad, but this one is just suuper disappointing."}
{"text":"Love the burritos and the fact they give you so many options to customize.  Fish burritos are great.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE MY BURRITOS...

Once I moved away from Toronto, burritos are all I can think of. So, when I'm at Burrito Boyz, I am 101% happy. 

It's clean and the service is very organized. It's in the middle of Little Italy and is very near the LCBO that I occasionally go to. So, just because of convenience, I'll be here. 

No matter what, I will always love my California burritos and Big Fat Burrito takes the cake for the best Toronto burrito. But, a burrito is a burrito for someone who is far away from a burrito source - so, Burrito Boyz is pretty good in my books! 

So, just a tip - when you are moving, really choose your place wisely"}
{"text":"I ordered the popular chicken burrito and it was just meh -  I couldn't taste the different flavours and ingredients. One thing I liked is that the service is extremely efficient. I will most likely come back and try it again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burrito yesterday,  as we do often enough.  The place is busy (as always), and the service was friendly.  But we noticed tons of mini fruit-fly type flies buzzing around all the burrito toppings, landing in them, etc.  I was quite put off by it.  The girls making the burritos didn't even make an attempt to swat the flies out of the way.  

I love Burrito Boyz, but I'll be rethinking it next time I crave a burrito."}
{"text":"Great place, solid burrito better than any of the other chains you might find in the area.  Service is good, relatively fast and prices are good. I usually get the small as a large is way too big. Minimal seating. Would recommend the halibut, but they're all good."}
{"text":"Generally like this place a lot. Lately I've had issues with portioning, especially with guacamole which they are now charging $0.85 for."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!  Busy from Monday to Sunday,  Anytime of the day this place seems to be busy.  The burritos are very big and filling, but be prepared to wait for it!"}
{"text":"Takes a while for you to get your burrito (about 15 - 20min) but it's fresh off the grill. The tortilla is nice and crispy, well worth the wait if you have time. Comes in two sizes, the large is about the same size as the chipotle burrito. It's also cheaper than chipotle...so that's a plus"}
{"text":"Love the food here! It's always prepared fresh and right in front of you. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. A large burrito is huge!! The hot sauce is to die for! Haven't found a burrito joint that makes tastier or hotter hot sauce. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Usually get take out bean and cheese burritos. Mostly it's delicious. A couple of times the order has been mixed up or the burrito is very sloppy - like they were rushed and just threw it all together. Unlike the way they usually take care to neatly wrap everything up. 
It may have been that they were training new staff? Not sure. But mostly very satisfied with the food and service. I love that they use fresh ingredients :)
Will keep going back!"}
{"text":"I love Burr Boyz, I gave the Lakeshore location a 5/5. This 3/5 is for the location. It's never been great here for me, and once you try the other locations, you'll never be back."}
{"text":"This is the best Burrito Boyz locations in the GTA. I've eaten plenty of times at the one in Streetsville, the one on Dundas and Hurontario, and one in Toronto. I live in heartland and the lakeshore is a far drive - I have to dodge two other Burrito Boyz to get there - but it's worth it every time. This is the best burrito you can get in the GTA. Don't waste your time going to Chipotle or Chorizo's, or even other Burrito Boyz locations.

Good portions, good value, good taste. Only problem is that so many people want a piece. It could be a wait, and there's only a few stools in the store to eat at."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years and decided to give it a try because its right beside my school. Food was awesome, I got the shrimp and chicken mix naked bowl it was so so so so good!!! I skimped out on the hot sauce this time, but I think I'll add it next time. Definitely worth your buck, they pile it on. So close to school, definitely will be going back. 

However I was in a rush to get home and I ate just a bit as soon as I got it (its so good fresh), but had to take mine back home with me on my commute. They have these biodegradable boxes which didn't really survive the trip home -- it got soggy. 

Service was a little slow, looked like they were training new employees, so it was understandable. But I did notice that they have a pre-order option, and some guy claimed he ordered 20 minutes ago and his food still wasn't even started... I ordered way after him and even got my stuff first. Probably wouldn't suggest the pre-order option, but the food is so good!

Update: I went again, this time it definitely wasn't filled as much, nor did it taste as good as the first time I reviewed it, but I'd still go back for sure."}
{"text":"Yummmmm!!

Just perfect! 
I love everything about this place, I come here at least once a month. 

The guy at the front is super sweet, the music is great. Patience is a virtue, as all good things take time. 

Don't forgot a pineapple Jumex with your burrito. 

My go to order is:
Bean and cheese on whole wheat
Extra beans, No cheese, no lettuce
Everything else with extra jalepeno peppers  
:)"}
{"text":"This isn't Mexican food. Their salsa tastes like ketchup, all though their habanero salsa is actually good. The only thing I liked about my burrito was the fish inside."}
{"text":"Edible but bland.

Better than Taco Bell but not better than other boutique burrito places.

I thought Burrito House was better."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm feeling burritos I usually make the venture down to Burrito Boyz. The burritos here in my opinion are step above barburrito and other burrito establishments. I've had pretty much all the different burritos they offer on the menu and were all very good.

My favorite on the menu is the halibut which they have a special for on Mondays. One of the benefits that I like from burrito boyz is that guacamole is complimentary. Most other burrito established charge extra for guacamole. Big plus to burrito boyz for including this in all burritos!"}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have visited Burrito Boyz so my wife and I hit it for an early supper today.

Always a popular place, we try to arrive in off-times and did so today, getting there about 2:45. We walked right up and ordered but found that a line formed quickly behind us.

The routine is order the size, meat choice and type of tortilla, then pay, move down and select all your fillings. Your receipt has your order number on it. You grab one of the few tables available, while they grill your burrito. Once done, they call your number and up you go to pick it up.

I always chuckle when I pick up my burrito as it is so heavy. So good too!

There is a lot of eating in one of these and each bite is enjoyable.

They have a very hot sauce and the key is to ask for three drips. They put one on each end and one in the middle and it is perfect.

Two large chicken burritos and two Diet Cokes plus tax came to $18.26. Big, tasty and well-priced too!

There may be places in the city that makes burritos as well but I doubt there is one that makes one better."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I'm a big burrito boyz fan and I tried this location through Uber Eats. I ordered a large steak burrito and what was delivered to me was the tiniest burrito I have ever seen, maybe the size of a small fajita, missing half the ingredients I ordered, that I finished in about 5 bites. I usually have the opposite problem when it comes to finishing my order. Thanks Burrito Boyz College street for leaving me hungry and unsatisfied :( will not order from you again."}
{"text":"gluten free burrito was the best I've ever had--not crumbly at all, didn't bust apart as I was eating it, didn't taste gluten free! delish. I say 9/10 rating. cheap, fast, fun, and well made."}
{"text":"This place was great!  I was in town with my family and we were looking for something to eat pretty late after getting back to the hotel room.  I did a quick search and this place came up!

I don't eat meat and they had vegetarian options so this worked out great!  Everyone enjoyed it so much we ate there again the very next night.  They have a huge selection to try from so the first night I tried the vegetarian burrito, which is huge!  The second night I tried the vegetarian nachos, which are also huge lol.  My sister and nephew both had the chicken burrito.

I wish they had this place in the states and if they do I wish it was near me!"}
{"text":"Best Burritos, hands down. I love this place so much, everything is super fresh and flavorful. You have to make a trip here, it's really nice that they brought this gem out to suburban Mississauga in Port Credit. It is always crowded with line ups, but you can pre-order on the phone and pick up. Again, make a visit asap."}
{"text":"This little gem found in Brampton is a good place for your burrito craving. A good place for late night eats. Whenever I go there my burrito was alway packed with ingredients. Although the seating layout is alittle small dont let that stop you from some good eats. Also the staff was a delight to deal with."}
{"text":"I stop by this place to pickup burritos on the way to Union station. They have a loyal clientele from the large number of office buildings around.

Being a chain there are certain standardizations which I understand cannot be avoided. Nevertheless it is possible to customize to an extent. Their default level of spiciness is quite low so make sure you ask for spicy. I'm not just referring to the level of hotness but an overall fulsome taste that results from a mixture of spices.

Okay place to stop for cheap burrito on the go, not a place you'd go out of your way to explore."}
{"text":"I love Burrito Boyz! It's always so yummy. The large is huge, so I usually take home half for a later meal.

The place is small, so don't bet on a sit-down experience. But if the weather's nice, take it to go. 

I've had the chicken burrito and the beans and cheese burrito. Both so good. Whenever I'm in the neighbourhood, I stop here."}
{"text":"Great value and great service, they have a huge range of toppings and their burritos are huge. All the meats I've tried are really good. The fish is to die for!"}
{"text":"The burritos here are hugeeee, I love the fresh gucamole and salsa they put in the burritos. The chicken and beef burritos are good, but the halibut burrito is excellent, the fish is fried but not greasy, it is nicely flakey and moist, they are very generous with the protein.  I only wish the waits aren't so long, they always have a line. A great meal if you are super hungry!"}
{"text":"The meat has no flavour... the location in Mississauga does a way better job. But the veggies and toppings are always fresh & their hot sauce is so yummy."}
{"text":"Nothing beats this place for a burrito! Large servings and I'm  stuffed! Just leave time for the long line ups"}
{"text":"Worst experience EVER! Won't go back. Ordered bowl with meat for $9.00 got a bowl of rice and lettuce. Called back won't  offer to resend a new one. The person has no sympathy. DO NOT GO THERE. THEY WONT MAKE YOUR ORDER RIGHT !!!"}
{"text":"I've been to 2 locations so far, this one is better. The staff are all really nice they always greet you when you come in and they're always smiling. All the girls remember you and try to remember your order if you've come before. Also they make a darn good burrito. Big filling and tasty! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Can't put a 4.5, the food was great, but the WiFi didn't work, and staff was a little snappy."}
{"text":"I cannot stress how much I love this place. Everyone I know  knows about Burrito Boyz because of my addiction. 

Step inside. Order what you like (chicken, steak, halibut, shrimp, there's more but at this point I'm salivating), mix it up if you want to be fancy. Then there's the holy grail of ingredients. This isn't some half put together, chopped up last week, and stuffed into some regular bread ingredients. These are some fresh guacamole, tomatoes, corn, rice & beans, and whatever else you choose to throw in there hugging each other in perfection. They heat that baby up and then INTO YOUR MOUTH.

That first bite makes your mouth water, and if you're anything like I, tear up a little bit. Each bite is different, if not better. Nom, nom, and then it's gone.

This place sees me so often its ridiculous. It does get pretty full in peak hours but it's worth the wait. It's open late for famished clubbers which are looking for good and filling food on a broke student budget. 

Getting hungry just talking about it. I'll see you there folks."}
{"text":"best burrito place in the west end ... i have been here several time and was never disappointed with the quality of food. some of the employees tend to have a bit of an attitude, but that won't stop me from going back"}
{"text":"I've been to this location as well as the downtown location. Phenomenal food and great quality every time. I seem to prefer the Etobicoke location; although it's identically busy as the downtown location, it's cleaner and has a lot more room to stand around and wait for your steaming hot burrito to finish off the grill. The best place to get burritos because the ingredients are always fresh and guac doesn't cost you extra!"}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz became my favorite burrito spot in Toronto. Crispy on the outside and a whole lot of flavor on the inside."}
{"text":"We went to Burrito Boyz for lunch. Arrived before 12pm on Wednesday. By 1pm it was packed. I got the spicy halibut wrap with everything. It came to $12. The wait was long, 15 - 20 minutes. The burrito was over a pound and it was amazing times four. I had guacamole and black beans. It was spicy but not too spicy, say 4 - 5 out of 10. And the kicker was that the wrap did not spill or spew over. I ate it up. And I was full. 
5/5 for sure! Best place I've seen yet."}
{"text":"Had the naked steak burrito. Nice size portions, very filling. Found the dish relatively flavorless. The bean mix, rice, and even the steak were not seasoned. When asked how hot I would like it I said medium. Three tiny dots of hot sauce were applied. They could ace this by spicing up the fillers."}
{"text":"I was excited to get a burrito after my hockey game, but man, this one didn't do it for me. 
I was wondering why it was taking so long to cook and when I got home and I opened it, I figured it out...burnt! 
This was not was I looking for when I peeled open the wrapper. 
The inside was mostly tasty, but the chicken was over cooked. 
This is my first bad experience at a burrito boys and I go often. 
I will now be avoiding this location unfortunately."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is hooked on to this place and took me to check it out. It was open at 1am on Friday and thats gives them 4 stars itself. I didn't have my hopes up but was i suprised to see the place so busy, with 5-6 people in the open kitchen. He had the chicken burrito and i had the beans cheese naked burrito. The quantity is huge and i couldn't finish mine. I could taste all the separate components as mine was not mixed like in a burrito. Love the rice and the avocado but i have had burritos before there is not much flavour. The service is fast but not much area to sit with maybe 8 chairs and the chair i finally got was wobbly. 
Come here for takeout on late nights, lacks in ambience."}
{"text":"Hands down best burrito place in town. I always call in advance to avoid the waiting."}
{"text":"I love Burrito Boyz - they have great veggie options and their burrito bowls are a treat (and they don't charge extra for guac!)

Tip: if you're going in around lunch at this location, it will be packed, so order ahead/Ritual and pick up!"}
{"text":"I love this location I am allergic to shellfish I love the fact that they keep it all separate and don't mix it on the grill the burritos are huge they're heavy like a brick its crazy I always get a small I don't think I could tackle a large the only downfall is when you get the shrimp one sometimes they kind of chince you on the shrimp so my boyfriend says"}
{"text":"They now have an amazing deal on dinner and a movie.  14$ for drink, movie pass and a small steak, chicken or veg burrito.  I have one hell of an appetite, trust me when I tell you a small will do you fine!  Best of all you don't have to use the movie pass right away, so no worries on sleeping through your film in a full belly, burrito enduced coma.

You can load your burrito up with an amazing selection of fresh ingredients with burritos being made right in front of you.  When they ask you how hot, if you like spicy go for the 5 drops of the housemade hot sauce. Beware the one server who squirts a whole line, you will know her by her eyeliner!  If she's making your burrito you better drop into sobeys on the way home and invest in a gallon of milk to help you get it down.

Super healthy and crazy flavourful dinner. My only suggestion would be to include a fish option that isn't breaded and deep fried. 

This takeout spot is always busy and yet to disappoint.  Hard to find parking in the tiny lot out front, try to park up the street on the east side of the mini mall."}
{"text":"Two words. 
Awe
Some.

Recently made the hot sauce hotter. Yay. 
Friendly people serving delicious burritos."}
{"text":"Burritos are delicious. This place has excellent hot sauce. Staff is great."}
{"text":"Love this place.. there food is amazing... my Favorited place awesome location Mississauga meadovale town center circle.. very clean, food always delicious...  my favorite is the chicken naked add everything also roasted potato and a side of chips with guacamole....sweet and healthy too."}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I have been here in the last few years.
I have tried many places in the city, but this spot has to be the best.
The staff are always friendly. And there is plenty of seating.
The best Burrito spot in Toronto!!! Hands down :)"}
{"text":"A must to try ! The staff is like a well oiled machine ! They kranked out the most delish quesadilla  that I've ever had ! Not to mention how pleasant and nice the staff was ! When they say spicey they mean spicey !!"}
{"text":"It's not a horrible place, but I have tasted better before. Got the chicken burrito with all toppings available. They are a bit cheap when it comes to the cheese but the rest of the burrito was stuffed. There was no taste to it though, it was really bland. It is not horrible but they should improve the quality of their food and make it more seasoned. The pricing is ok for the amount you are getting."}
{"text":"My favourite burritos in town!  I've been to several places being a big fan of the burrito. But, Burrito Boyz is unsurpassed."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time and ordered a TON of food. Got 2 Bean and rice burritos, 2 Hallibut burritos, 1 chicken and shrimp mix burrito, 3 cheese Quesadillas. 

Staff are very courteous and service was very fast despite my order being so large and the place being packed. 

The fresh ingredients they use really enhanced the flavor and all the food turned out very DELICIOUS and filling! One thing to note... the medium hot sauce is still pretty hot, and I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy foods, so I can't imagine what the hot, hot sauce would be like, but if your not a fan of too much heat, stick to mild!

Price is very reasonable and you definitely get your money's worth, especially with the huge portion sizes. 

I will definitely be coming back to this joint to satisfy my burrito cravings from now on!"}
{"text":"Love the food! But the customer service, the way the employees speak to customers is horrible. Can't you just ask your employees to be pleasant and kind? Really bad customer service."}
{"text":"I go here almost once a week. The burritos are amazing, the customer service is phenomenal, and it's cheaper than a foot-long from Subway! I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food is okay the line-ups are long at times and it is hardly worth the wait. I have tried the burrito with chicken and bean. Now that I have something to compare It with it doesn't stack up. Rice is undercooked and hard it lacks flavors compared to other South American restaurants. Chipotle is better."}
{"text":"First of all, I love this place!  They make the most awesome and largest burritos for a decent price.  I really want to give them a 5, but why the 4?  The only thing that annoys me is the line ups.  Every time I'm there, i don't know if its just coincidence or what - the line up is huge!  The longest I've ever waited was 45 minutes and that was in the summer.  Of course it was worst the wait when you're craving for a good burrito but I was starving.  I have tried several Burrito Boyz location in the city but this location is known to stuff your burrito to the max.  

P.S...Also if you looking for a nice day out then Port Credit is definitely a nice place to go to and enjoy some delicious burrito and coffee or other great restuarants in the area."}
{"text":"Tip - order over the phone, so you only have to wait in the cashier line up. Since there is no seating, a good spot is the park by the river and library. Lots of spots there."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD, GREAT VALUE

I had large chicken and steak burrito and it was huge. I got everything on it except black beans, when asked how hot I wanted it I said HOT. Next time I will go for medium, It was very flavourful and very reasonable for the price."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend, we both got chicken burritos, he got a 'naked' one. The toppings were plentiful and the prices weren't that bad either. My only hesitation was with the chicken itself. It was under seasoned and just not as delicious as I would have liked it to be. It kind of made the burrito less appealing and it didn't compare to other burrito places in the neighborhood (Z-Teca). All in all, the burrito was filling and full of delicious toppings, but the main meat topping was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Went here in the summer on a Friday afternoon and it was pouring rain. Stopped by BB and ordered a small Chicken Burrito. I was amazed at the care and attention to detail in preparing the burrito. The end result was a hefty meaty delicious burrito. Greatly recommended!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Burritos!!! Fresh ingredients and efficient staff. It's a no frills take out feel but the food never disappoints. I love that I can get in and out with no fuss, certain times of day the wait can be longer but it's worth it every time!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this joint time after time, I finally got a chance to try it! 

If you want some affordable, delicious Tex-Mex, then here's the place to grab your lunch! Upon first glance, the place doesn't look like anything special. However, you're in for a treat. Skip Chipotle, and never, ever walk into Taco Bell again. The prices are fair, the food is fresh. I tried the steak bowl, and it was everything I wanted it to be. It does get crowded during lunch, but it's worth the wait. 

There's not too much else to say - it's not fine dining by any means, but a place you need to try!"}
{"text":"Got the large chicken burrito with mild heat and was impressed with all the topping choices you can add at no extra charge and adding a bag of chips and pop to your meal is only +1.99. I found the mild to be quite spicy but my partner who got hot said he didn't even taste anything...so if you do like it spicy ask for extra heat. The burrito itself was filling and service was fast considering how many other people were ordering. I would defiantly recommend this place as they have fillings for every taste (beef, sweet potato, chicken etc..)."}
{"text":"Ma fuckah, really, not the best burrito in the world, but better than Chiplotle and awesome after making an ass out of yourself on QW. Halibut or haddock in a burrito? Hot sauce that is actually hot? Grilled after you order it? WWHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT.

-1 for the looooonnnng ass time it takes for them to make these. But whatevz, whatevz."}
{"text":"Great burritos! I checked their website for nutritional info. Pretty scary how much fat is in them!  However,The ingredients are fresh, the staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"For some reason, I got a better burrito at the Lakeshore (Stevebak) location then at Dundas. Good food, and can be made very spicey!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars because I paid $9 for 12 pieces of calamari that wasn't the greatest. However the burritos are blessed. I would recommend the burrito. 10/10 for burrito."}
{"text":"Best burrito in the city, hands down. Good quality mexican is harder to find in Toronto than you think and this burrito delivers. I always get either a small halibut or shrimp with all the spicy fixin's. Everything is consistently fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to burrito boyz before, you should stop reading this and go there. Right now.

Burrito boys stands out for a number of reasons, some of which include:

- the burritos are always really REALLY good.

- in addition to the standard chicken/beef/pork/veg burrito options that exist elsewhere, you can do a 'bean & cheese', haddock or halibut burrito. 

-staff are always quite nice and happy to correct 'mistakes' in burrito prep (\"oooh, no jalpenos on the small chicken\")

The main downside of Burrito boyz vs. the other burrito options in town is the wait. I don't really get it. Other places can create and warm up your burrito a heck of a lot faster. The extreme efficiency of Freshwest Grille sort of puts them to shame on this point."}
{"text":"I've been a customer of Burrito Boyz for about 7 years now.

It's hard to mess up a meal when you're creating it out of fresh tasty food.  Burrito Boyz has a lot of healthy toppings.

My personal to order favourite is the small halibut.  It's very light and despite getting a few various toppings on it, I don't feel that I've overeaten and ready for a nap.  Not sure how I'd feel about the large order, but small does me in fine.

If you're going in for lunch, I do suggest you call-in because they can get very busy and the wait may take up to 20 minutes.

Overall, good food, service.  Wait times can exceed expectations."}
{"text":"This place has ruined my burrito eating experiance.  Every other burrito restaurant is now a disappointment.  It's Burrito Boyz or nothing."}
{"text":"The fish tacos at this place are so delicious. A small is more than enough and the service is good. They just need a bit of seasoning. I always have to sprinkle vegeta to bring the flavors out."}
{"text":"This place was great. The small burrito is more than enough to tackle a full day's worth of hunger. This place is better than mucho burrito by far. My new fav place."}
{"text":"It's not the be all end all of burrito joints but it hits the spot. I would definitely recommend the fish tacos as they were much better than the chicken/steak I'd had before."}
{"text":"I try lots of burrito places and these are the best I have had yet. I must have eaten here maybe 50 times by now."}
{"text":"Great service; always friendly, fast, and consistent! I love the naked sweet potato burrito. Yummmm"}
{"text":"This location is probably one of the biggest burrito Boyz locations.  Really enjoyed the burrito,  but overall burrito Boyz usually does it right. 

Make sure to come mon-wed after 7 they have buy one burrito get the second 50% off. 

Great deal with the pals"}
{"text":"Friendly staff but the burrito wasn't very good. I've been to all the other burrito joints and I always get a shrimp burrito, this was by far the worst! Shrimp taste like heated old cheap shrimp-ring quality. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what the reviews state. Delicious and cheap. Call in advance for pick up and enjoy bypassing the line."}
{"text":"I've only had the bean and cheese burritos, but they're great every time! I've been getting the naked burritos lately too and am loving them. Great food and prices!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for burritos!  I regularly get the chicken with the gluten free wrap.  One of the few places that offers gluten free.  Always fantastic!"}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES
Generally recognized as the/one of the best place(s) in the city to get a burrito. Owners recently split and this is apparently the better location. 

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Halibut Burrito - Surprizingly good. A staff favourite.
2. Chicken Burrito - For those less adventurous. No, really, this is incredible. 
3. Steak Burrito - Originally my favourite, has dropped because I found out about the Halibut and I went to Philly and had lots of cheese steak and now this meat tastes second rate to me. 

Those are your options, I'd suggest choosing by mood. They're all delicious. Even the veggie one is great. Order a large if you're really hungry and a regular if you're hungry. If you're not hungry at all but your friends are grabbing just get a quesadilla or better yet, man up and get a large (Farva). Even if you don't want one.

SERVICE NOTES
Like Ghandi's, this can take a while. Certainly the worst part of the experience is waiting in line for forever for your burrito. So, like Ghandi's, do the smart thing, put the number in your phone and call ahead. 

LOCATIONS NOTES
Adelaide, just east of Duncan. The old location on Peter was legendary, like a tiny dungeon that was seemingly always filled with 10 more people than it could possibly fit. I'm not sure what the new location is like inside but I hope it's the same. 

HUMOUROUS STORY
At the end of a long night of drinking we decided Burrito Boyz was the call and 1/2 of us walked over to Peter to grab burritos for the 8 of us. Of course we were drunk and completely forgot to call ahead so when we finally placed our order we were told it was going to be about 20-30 minutes. So I gave the cute girl behind the counter my number and told her we'd be at the pub, awaiting her call. After a few pints at the Black Bull she calls to tell us they're ready and I ask her if I can get her anything from the bar and she asks for a pint glass. I guess she wasn't really expecting me to deliver but obviously she didn't know the way in which I rolled, even back then. I have to admit I felt pretty cool striding up to the counter and plunking the stolen pint glass down in front of her. Of course, as soon as I realised that I thought I was cool I realised I wasn't. It was just like Almost Famous. I've met me, and I'm not cool."}
{"text":"C'est la nouvelle tendance depuis quelques années à Toronto : les restaurant burrito poussent un peu partout en ville. Cette cuisine rapide inspirée par la cuisine mexicaine n'est pas désagréable quand on veut manger bien et manger vite. Les Burrito Boys proposent cependant des burritos originaux : flétan, haddock et crevettes! Vous n'êtes donc pas obligés de rester dans le classique fromage ou steak. Le service est généralement agréable, l'équipe est jeune, percée et tatouée de toutes part, c'est le genre de la maison et pourquoi pas!"}
{"text":"Have to agree with everyone so far. My favorite part is that they ask you how spicy you want it when you request spicy. Other places just assume the level of spice.  The size of these Burritos is incredible!!!  I recommend calling ahead.  That way you do not stand in line waiting.  It is CASH ONLY, so bring plenty.  It's worth it!!  They currently have 3 locations in the GTA, Toronto, Etobicoke (Long Branch), Mississauga (Stavebank)"}
{"text":"Meh.  It was okay, I can't say I've experienced better since I have not gone anywhere else for burritos in a long time so I can't compare.  

It was busy with lots of young hipster / student looking people.   Washroom was not available for use as the sign said it was not in service.

My small chicken burrito was average size and came to around $6.50.   I didn't think it was anything special.  Beans, lettuce, salsa and other typical toppings are available.  I guess this would be a healthier alternative to burger & fries if you are in the club district area.  I think falafel is tastier though.

I think this place is busy because there isn't much else around that's cheap and open around 10pm on a Wed. night."}
{"text":"One of the best burritos in town, fresh, well made, generous portions, great sauce..."}
{"text":"I wish i could give it less than 1 star. Unfortunately this place customer service is really lacking. It used to be a nice place to go but I for sure won't be coming back. They are always having transaction problems and their solution to their own machine issues is to send you to the bank to the out cash and come back... Regardless if these transactions may cost you more. Management is not accommodating. There is no consideration when such issues are on their part. They rather lose costumers over addressing their own store issues"}
{"text":"If you don't know about Burrito Boyz, then you should just find one close to you, and go.  A Toronto-Franchise success story, they expanded from 2 locations in downtown clubland to 7+ locations across the GTA.  
I prefer to get mine double grilled, so it's crispy on 4 sides, not just 2.  Also, in the interests of keeping my burrito a bit dryer, I forgo the burrito sauce, but always add at least a stripe of the Habanero sauce.  Not for the faint of heart, at the very least, have them add a dot or 2.  
The Quesedilla's are good, and I've only heard great things about the halibut burrito. I'm always drawn to the beef one while I'm there.  

The price to goodness/fullness ratio is great for the hungry yet tight-fisted."}
{"text":"If you want more expensive chipotle that doesn't taste as good, this is your place. I got a large steak burrito and the chip+drink combo. The \"steak\" was just poorly seasoned hamburger, definitely not steak. The toppings worker did not seemed very happy that I was ordering food nor that I didn't know what the procedure was. Once the toppings were on she handed the burrito to a worker who didn't have gloves on. 
My suggestion. Just drive across the street to Chipotle. You will be much more satisfied."}
{"text":"Random Burrito Adventure.  Apparently you're not a true Toronto yelper until you've reviewed a burrito joint.   Apparently 'yelper' has no capital 'Y' (thi from Kat \"anticapitalist\" F.  (But seriously, thanks for the heads-up).

10:05 PM Tuesday.  Sudden Burrito Craving.  But I live at Yonge and Eglinton.

10:55 PM Tuesday.   Walked into Burrito Boyz for my first ever fish burrito (halibut, to be precise).

Three star burrito, five star service.  I've been here twice now, and both times felt like a very welcome guest, notwithstanding the fact that they were almost closed both times.  These people are great.

I'm no burritofficionado, but I'd like a little better mixing of the ingredients.  They seem to be layered at Burrito Boyz, which leads to lateral discrepancies in the flavour plane, if you catch my drift.  If not, then all I mean is \"the left side tastes different from the right.\"  It's not quite a disturbance in the Force, but it's something to consider.

Also, not sure if this is the norm with halibut burritos, but there were a few chewy pieces near the end of mine.  No biggie, and nothing inedible.  Just not perfect.  

I'd go back, and I'd recommend for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for a small burrito. It wasn't as loaded. Had the gluten free chicken burrito and bf had the chicken burrito. There were only 3 customers already eating and we had ordered next. This was lunch time. Full staffed. Staff were super energetic and lively.. however, we waited over 10 minutes.. probably 15 minutes, & you know when you're starving, you want food fast!  So we assumed we'd get our food soon, with it being less customers and having a *full* staff. But no. About 2 more customers ordered after us, waiting.

As we got our food finally, it was okay. Not the best burrito we had. There wasn't enough kick and we were still hungry. We didn't want to spend more than what we got. As we thought it'd be a big loaded burrito - but was pretty small.

We probably won't go back there again."}
{"text":"Best calamari and shrimp quesadilla iv had ! I just wish they had a delivery service for the buildings around them !"}
{"text":"Best vegan burrito and burrito bowl in Toronto!  My go to item is the naked bean and cheese, made vegan (no dairy) and with less refried bean, extra rice, mild, with all the other veg toppings except the jalapeños. It's absolutely delicious, very filling and will run you about $6! Meat eaters will also love it!"}
{"text":"Good burrittos. 2 fish options Halibut and Haddock. Pretty consistent quality of food.  Location is terrible because there are only 12 parking spots and no street parking. A few times we've gone somewhere else cause we can't find a park"}
{"text":"Order a naked burrito with a mix of steak and sweet potato and I got chicken instead and it was cold. Usually good but was very disappointed this time."}
{"text":"Very delicious Burritos, Really large sandwiches, reasonably low price, Open late at weekends but the line up would be disaster, you might end up waiting in line for 45 minutes on Saturday night at 3:00 am!!!"}
{"text":"Awful. 
Ordered from Skip the Dishes (never using again!). Included 2 toppings that I didn't request (allergies). Paid for extra Guac and didn't get it. Also didn't get any sour cream or salsa as per requested. 

Called store. Was advised to COME to the store to pick up missing toppings...its a blizzard outside and I already paid $5 for delivery. So stupid."}
{"text":"Fantastic burritos, prepared beautifully. Their employees are very social also, making the wait for your burrito a little more tolerable.

All in all, their burritos are solid, always delicious and always filling. Easily streetsvilles number 1 burrito spot."}
{"text":"I found this place accidentaly while visiting someone in that area. I like Mexican food, so got super excited and just went in, checked the menu and ordered a burrito. Have to say that I was actually disappointed. It's an alright place, ambience is nothing to talk about, food is also okayish."}
{"text":"I've been going this location for about a year and have never been disappointed by their quality or service. They don't rush your order, they cook it to perfection. The burritos are delicious and very filling. I tried the Fat Bastard across the street and was not pleased."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best burrito I ve had in Toronto!!! Each bite overflows with flavours. Great price, generous portion. I am a huge huge fan!!!"}
{"text":"Good burritos.
Fresh ingredients, well prepared.
A little expensive though.
Steak burrito was $11:00 without a drink."}
{"text":"This place is my fav burrito experience. The moosh factor is high -- plenty of fillings to squeeze into my face. They put piles of toppings in the tortilla and are generous with the steak. When my blood pressure is good I treat myself to the halibut and it is wondrous. The staff are a lacklustre bunch and I think want to be elsewhere but are quick enough."}
{"text":"Great burrito's and reasonable prices. Be sure to check in before ordering to get a free drink with your order!!"}
{"text":"I've read about this place for a few years and it gained popularity over that period of time. However, I've got a self-imposed ban on eating burritos outside of California and the western US because of the heartbreak I've been experiencing when I'm promised the moon and I get a weak substitute.

A vegetarian friend brought me here and we got the 'vegetarian burrito' which included 'soya meat' (wtf is that?) with some sketchy sauce that tasted like Worcestershire sauce. They were missing some important ingredients including cilantro and fresh lime. After that, they grilled my burrito and it made the tortilla a bit singed, brittle and dry. 

When I took a bite, the burrito fell apart because of the dry tortilla. The Worcestershire sauce was a bit over powering and the other ingredients were fairly indistinguishable.

I highly doubt that Arnold Schwarzenegger would visit this place and I won't be back either."}
{"text":"Always good for burritos. Unfortunately, guac is now extra, but I'll still come back! The staff is super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great choice for a late night meal! I was able to order a burrito sans shell, which turned out to be a really great burrito bowl! I like the concept of warm meat, warm burrito, but it seems like it failed on some of my friends' orders as they received half-warm, half-cold burritos. The atmosphere in this place is not sexy, but it's a solid choice for late night grub!"}
{"text":"When you want something huge. This is it. Even the small is pretty bloody big. You just need to be careful with the toppings. To many toppings ruins the taste for me"}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz

Well worth the wait and money they are huge its a must try if your in Mississauga (Port Credit)
Very clean and fresh veg."}
{"text":"Been a loving customer for 6+ years. Doesn't get better value downtown than $7.25 for the small chicken bowl. Perfect every time!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Burrito Boys and was  excited to hear they were opening a location close to work. Good bye lunch hours! A short walk later our group of five walked in greeted by a few people in line. We opted to go after the rush just after 1 pm. Service was fast! 

As a novice Burrito Boys customer I found the menu very clear with options listed and even had the cashier show us the difference between the small and large burrito with a sizing guide they handcrafted- helpful!

I opted for the the small 1lb 2oz Naked bowl with shrimp and got all toppings to get an accurate flavour profile. Let's just say there is no skimping with the toppings! I was slightly disappointment with the mere 4 shrimps I received even though I was told i would get double that after specifically asking.

Other choices my colleagues ordered:

Naked bowl with sweet potato- sliced with a generous portion and amazing flavour!

Naked bowl with chicken- raved about it along with the hot sauce- lets  just say it brings the heat! The meat was about half her container and smelled amazing.

Burrito with Haddock- HUGE portion of fish! I was shocked at the size- about half the size of a dinner plate

Burrito with chicken- classic 

Best yet- guacamole is free!!! Everyone also raved about the refried beans!

I will say the Naked bowls were served a lot quicker as the burritos require toasting about an extra 5 minutes.

There is about seating for 30-35 diners so spacious given their other locations. 

All in all I would have rated this place five stars however was disappointed in the amount of shrimp I received. I left full and satisfied without feeling sick to my stomach given the amount of food I ate.

Next on the list is the Haddock Burrito- it looked divine!!"}
{"text":"I live in Streetsville and eat their bean and cheese burrito almost every week!  Consistently good service and I love my burritos!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this restaurant after hearing about it from friends.  I was a bit disappointed.  The food tastes good and is made fresh to order.  I ordered a chicken burrito and was not expecting it to be ground chicken.  It made me wonder if the \"steak\" is just ground beef.  I asked for extra sour cream once getting my burrito and was told it was 50 cents extra.  I was also informed it was free if added to the burrito, but if asked to be put on the side, its an extra charge. You would think that after paying nearly 10 bucks for a burrito a bit of sour cream would be complimentary.  

The service is efficient but impatient.  For a first time visitor I felt as if they were annoyed by me.  I would go here again, but I would not say its on my favourites list.  There is nothing special about ground chicken, just another fast food joint."}
{"text":"I was super excited that Burrito Boyz was opening a branch close to home, and I finally got to visit during their grand opening! 

Everything is exactly the same as their downtown location, except they have so much more seating and so much room for activities! 

They now offer gluten free tortillas and extra guacamole is extra. I tried the halibut burrito at this location and it was perfect! It could be a bit of a wait if you're a walk-in. 

Next time I would call ahead to place my order to avoid the wait. Service at this location is also significantly more friendly compared to the way too busy downtown location. 

Now there's no need to travel all the way downtown for some hearty burritos, I'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"This is the only place me and my boyfriend go for burritos. (Possibly because it's a great excuse to go upstairs and grab my fav. Triple Pork Poutine from Smoke's) 

I personally am not a big fan of burritos - I just don't like the texture of beans with salsa. However, at Burrito Boyz, I load my steak burrito with guacamole, rice and cheese, and that's all I need because there's a good amount of meat in there that might cause your wrap to explode mid-bite. 

Although my favourite is the Steak Burrito, everything else here will taste amazing - especially after a drunken club  night. They are open till 4a.m. on Friday and Saturday therefore the go-to joint for a bite after clubbing. 

Also, they have a great drink selection. I always get the Guava juice since I don't see that brand (Jumex) sold anywhere else. 

I am definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"The SO and I decided to head to Burrito Boyz for a quick dinner last night; I have not been to this location before.  I loved the open space and ordering process.  Within minutes of ordering, we were given our numbers and they asked how we would like our burrito and quesadilla. 

Another few minutes later, our food was done!  I got the Shrimp quesadilla and it was delicious.  The side sauces were great.  My SO's Halibut burrito was yummy.

Dinner for two with a drink was under $20!  I would definitely come back again.  Make sure to visit Burrito Boyz if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food, a good choice is the Shrimp Burrito i don't really remember all the topping option but there were many, and none of them cost extra; i think the total of my order was under $6 and i can easily say i would have paid double that for the Burrito if not triple; better than any Burrito I tried in the States easily, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Filling and decently priced food.  I got a chicken burrito with all the fixings and enjoyed it.  I got take out and the wait wasn't too long but it also wasn't very quick.  In my opinion a very average burrito place."}
{"text":"Oh my god. Put that mexican in my mouth. 

I'm not a big fan of mexican food. But I am a big fan of burrito boyz. At this location they hiring very 'unique' looking people. Don't let it deter you, they're good at what they do.

Food is always wonderful. I'm partial to the quesadilla. It's done just right, with whatever you want in it. Ingredients always appear fresh and are delicious. 

Never a long wait, and never very expensive. Not too much to say about this place really, it's simple, and the quality is solid. Give it a shot even if you aren't specifically looking for mexican, it's always good."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz is good!  Been to several locations and they have been consistent at every location.  The halibut is the best! Not that many good burrito joints in Scarborough.  No longer have to make a far trek to get a decent burrito.  Top 5 for sure. My top 5 picks in no particular order Burrito Boyz, Fat Bastards, Banditos, Chino Locos, and Chipotle. Order the halibut, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Had \"Naked chicken Burrito\".. Pretty good. Also good staff and service."}
{"text":"Halibut and shrimp mixed burrito is bomb!"}
{"text":"(Btw, this a review for the Burrito Boyz in Mississauga) 
Best. Burrito. Ever -and I'm not exaggerating at all. 
When we arrived the place was jam packed with people. And the store is quite small so I already knew this place had to be great. 
The prices are inexpensive and are a great value for money - plus there are meat, chicken, fish, shrimp burritos on offer too. 
Ordered myself a small steak burrito and waited about 15 minutes for it. Which isn't exactly fast food but it worth the wait as everything is super fresh.
When I got my burrito I remember thinking it weighed as much a newborn haha. For a small - it was very large and heavy.
The taste was so good - lots of flavor, fresh vegetables, great guacamole and the tortilla was soft. 
If you are going to a Taco Bell for a burrito please drive past and get a burrito from here!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? These guys are amazing. They're always consistent with their burritos and quesadillas. The staff are always friendly and a pleasure to deal with. The managers are on point and even if a mistake is made, they'll go above and beyond to fix the problem. Kudos to Burrito Boyz 5&10!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Toronto and have never tried this place before. I got the large burrito with chicken. It tasted fine but nothing special, it is better than Taco Bell but I don't think I will be leaving Chipotle anytime soon. The quality I didn't feel is as good as Chipotle and never being there before I wasn't sure how to order and had to ask the woman behind the counter (whom was pleasant and was happy to explain). They also don't have a soda machine, they sell canned and bottled drinks. 
Experience was good but don't feel the need to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome and cheap. Medium sauce got kick. Afraid of the xxx one."}
{"text":"My favourite burrito anywhere. Be it when I'm stumbling home after a night out, or searching for some solace while nursing a nasty hangover, or just hungry at my work lunch break... Burrito Boyz is my goto place. 
If you've never been here, I recommend getting the Halibut Burrito (a million times over). This delicious burrito is filled with tender fish chunks, guacamole, sour cream, jalapenos, corn, cilantro... the works basically. All sorts of amazing! I don't care what the purists say. This beats all other burritos everywhere (Even ones I've had in Greater Mexico/San Diego).

Only negative is the wait times at the hour of the devil when hungry drunken churls descend upon this haven. You just have to learn to suck it up and wait. For regular hours, I recommend calling ahead of time and placing your order so you don't have to wait salivating at the counter watching everyone else eat."}
{"text":"As someone with special dietary restrictions, I called ahead and pre-ordered a veggie soy burrito, hot, with the works and no dairy. I drove to pick up my order and when I arrived I found out that the cash machine on site was out of order. This meant a walk in the rain to get cash. This is not the first time this has happened (machine being out of order), and I would have appreciated a heads up form the girl who took down my order.

Once I had my burrito in hand I headed back to the office. Not until I sat down at my desk did I take a bite did I notice it was oozing with cheese and sour cream. Not cool.

If you're working at a food establishment and someone asks for a special order and you don't know what they mean by \"no dairy\" or \"vegan\" please ask the patron to clarify; don't just say \"no problem\". 

The food here is a step above Taco Bell but definitely not the best veg burrito around."}
{"text":"Love this place and I come here often. My only complaint is if the manager is there it's not as good because portions shrink and it's not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"they have delicious burritos, even vegan ones. Non-vegans go gaga for this place... i heard the halibut burrito is good. take-out only... you can call in advance and pick up later because they get really busy on weekday lunches.

However - i asked for green peppers and some of their hot peppers got mixed in and i had to throw half of it out. for that reason they get 3 stars - kind of a big mistake taste-wise!!!"}
{"text":"The Halibut Burrito with everything rules.  The huge piece of fish was flaky, moist and fresh tasting.  I don't think there's anywhere else in the city you can get something comparable.  

I've also had their quesadilla several times and love their sauce and the flavouring of both their beef and chicken.  You can't got wrong with either.

Order by phone if you want to save time, or avoid the lunch hour for faster service.

It's not a quiet place to eat when it's busy...so you might want to find a nearby park bench (weather permitting)."}
{"text":"You can't beat burrito boys when it comes to value. The burritos are great with a wide choice of filling (veggie, chicken, beef, fish) and toppings."}
{"text":"Same as the other burrito boyz but on a right location! Really good service! I liked the part that they take orders over the phone and keep it ready by the time you get there! Isn't that amazing in a busy area like this? :) they even do deliveries! The staff is pretty nice too! 
I go there pretty often now! I am loving it:)"}
{"text":"Average burrito joint. The prices are very good for the amount and quality of food you get. I always get the chicken burrito either naked or on WW. Always a good choice for something cheap n tasty."}
{"text":"Not just yummy or Yummy, but YUMMY!!!

Went here after the bar and this definitely hit THE spot! I ordered a large mixed (chicken & beef together) burrito with all the toppings minus the green peppers and jalapenos.  My favourite part?  The fact that it is wrapped tightly (so nothing falls out) and that they heat it up in the wrap before you get it so the cheese is nice and gooey!  YUM YUM YUM!!!

I would DEFINITELY GO BACK.  I just wish that they offered combos."}
{"text":"I have been going to BB since they were in that dingy tiny original location on Peter, and I lived through their restaurant divorce and relocation to Adelaide.  I have been going to this location ever since (well, except now they are two doors west).  Nothing has changed with the place.  It is consistent and the price is on point.  I have had everything on their menu, but my go-to is a small haddock and shrimp on whole wheat with medium heat.

They now have a CALAMARI burrito....can't wait to try it!"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLY hit or miss. It's clear that most of the people voting this up have never been to the Port Credit location or haven't seen the slip in quality as of late. 

There are certain things I come to expect at a Burrito Boyz. As the restaurant of choice for drunk/partying teens, long lineups and angry customers are just an unavoidable part of the experience. Faced with a packed pho restaurant next door and this, we took the safe option and braved the lineup at B.B.

You're either waiting 5-10 minutes for a naked burrito bowl, or you're waiting an extra 10-20 minutes for them to cook the burrito in a tortilla, especially during a lineup. There's no in-between. I opted for the former option, and was a bit miffed when I saw the end product.

When I say, \"Put everything on it\", I don't mean that you should skip half the ingredients altogether, especially the sauces. The girl working on making food that night clearly had better priorities, although perhaps it was a blessing in disguise, because it went through me right quick the next morning anyway.

I found the quality to be decent, but way too dry without sauces. That brings me to the next point - paying for guacamole.

Yes, I understand why they did it. No, I still don't agree with it. If you're going to charge me an extra dollar or more for guacamole, I expect more than a tiny little spoonful on the corner of my plate.

It feels like the staff are cutting way too many corners here. Unlike the P.C. location (where the staff have a clearly-defined series of commands they give each other, and are diligent and quick to boot), half the employees just seem to roam around aimlessly in the back. It doesn't help that the restaurant itself feels very shoddy as of late. The menu looks disorganized and scattered, and no one seems to have been cleaning the utilitarian-metal tables and chairs scattered around.

I would like to think that this location could step its game and be a truly stellar branch, but I suppose operating in the virtual centre of Mississauga and catering to tons of people who don't know any better has made them unwieldy and slow.

I expected better from this chain. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"The staff are always kind and courteous. I've never waited more than five minutes for my order. Very satisfied; I will be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"The burrito is very good and portion is big!  Funnily, though, the naked small burrito is bigger than the non-naked large burrito.  Definitely a place we would visit again!"}
{"text":"What can I say.... love Burrito Boyz.  This location is a grab and go and is usually busy. But the service is bad and they are quick.

I have tried there Halibut and Chicken Burritos and they make then well here by putting all the topping properly and filling it to the max. The parking is limited in front on the store but shouldn't be hard to find parking in the streets."}
{"text":"Very surprised I haven't reviewed Burrito Boyz before, because I've been coming here for years. Delicious burritos with fresh ingredients. Usually get the chicken or the halibut burrito. It can get quite busy here so go between peak hours."}
{"text":"Great bang for buck. If you're craving some Mexican to fill you up for ~$6-7, this is the place! It's very customizable and there's a lot of options to choose from - the ingredients are very fresh. You can tick all the options you like but it seems like most people like \"everything\" on it! I find it amazing that they are able to stuff all the ingredients in one burrito!

I think the most popular choice is chicken, and I'd stick with all their sauces and choosing everything on it (except for the odd things you don't like eg. hot peppers for me). Make sure you go hungry - you'll be bloated after!"}
{"text":"I come here usually every Sunday. I am obsessed with their naked burritos! Amazing! The staff is awesome and the food is ALWAYS good and fresh! Good portions too!"}
{"text":"Got the Bean and Cheese Burrito in a Bowl (delish!-) with a bottle of water for less than $9."}
{"text":"Decent burrito. I've eaten my fair share of burritos in California, and no, these aren't as good. But for a Canadian burrito place - pretty decent.  Wasn't the fastest, though they were pretty busy at the time. On the plus side staff was very friendly and acknowledged customers as they came in and let them know they'd be right with them.  This goes a long way in my books and I'm willing to wait when someone acknowledges you and is polite!  Would come back for this reason alone."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for burritos, you can't do much better than this.

Burrito Boyz opened a few years back in Port Credit, at an out-of-the-way location (the site of a former boutique near the corner of Stavebank and Lakeshore Road), and proved to be an immediate hit with patrons, causing lines stretching out the door and enough food being pumped out to fund the GDP of a small foreign nation. I have been coming here for a long time, and the quality continues to be just as good as it was when it opened, as I once again discovered a couple nights back when I bought a naked burrito bowl.

I would contend that there's no better place to get burritos in Mississauga than this location, and of the two Burrito Boyz locations I've visited in this city, the Port Credit location is the best by leaps and bounds. The ingredients are fresh, the employees have their assembly and cooking process honed to a science, they're always friendly, and no matter what you order, you're guaranteed to be left full or with enough leftovers for another meal.

Case in point: the burrito bowl I got. For about $10, you can get a takeout container filled to the brim with everything under the sun, including guacamole, heaping scoops of beans and rice, sour cream, plenty of toppings and the optional hot sauce, which (depending on how much you ask for) will make you get on your knees and pray to sweet baby Jesus for relief.

The only real downside of the place is that there's little to no seating, and you'll be waiting quite a while if you come by during lunch or dinner hours. The handful of bar stools in the place can barely be sat on because it's always packed full of people either waiting to order or waiting for their order. Likewise, the picnic tables they set out during the summer are often the favored targets of wasps that swarm the garbage can by the side entrance.

That being said, it's a moot point. The experience Is so good that you owe it to yourself to check this location if you haven't done so already. It really is one of the best places anywhere to get a burrito.

Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not many words needed. Simple. Satisfying. Delicious. Friendly staff. 

Good bang for your buck too. Lots of choices for toppings & sauces. YUM."}
{"text":"It's really more of a 3.5, but I'm going to round up. This is the original Burrito Boyz location (est. 2004), and it has truly become a Toronto icon over the past 12 years. My best memories of this place date back to several years ago (2010-2012), when it was tucked under the Smoke's Poutinerie and always had a line of drunk, obnoxious partygoers trailing out the door at 2am. 

Last night, I checked out their new space next door and I'm happy to report that not much has changed from the good ol' days - it's really just become bigger and better, with more seating room and more variety on the menu. 

THE GOOD:
- Tons of ingredient options here! BB has branched out beyond burritos into quesadillas, and the burrito options continue to be aplenty: chicken, steak, haddock, shrimp, and now even sweet potato. 
- Great value for money. My large steak was ~$9 with tax, and boy, did it ever pack a punch. I have a big appetite and still had to save half for the next morning. 
- Given that it's situated less than 1 km. from more bars and clubs than I can count, BB is perfect for late night post-club grub. 

THE BAD: 
- Cash only - I hate that this is still a thing in 2016. There is an ATM if needed. 
- If you come after midnight, don't expect a pleasant dining experience - the tables will be dirty, the drunkards will be rampant, and the staff will be hollering numbers and orders at the top of their lungs to compete with the noise level of said drunkards. If this doesn't sound like your jam, order an Express burrito (which comes with all the fixings) or stay clear. 
- I think the quality of their food really comes down to personal preference. Personally, I feel like all the ingredients in these bad boys kind of mush together and don't stand out on their own. I'm more of a Z-Teca or Chipotle fan myself. Regardless, it's still a good burrito.

All in all, I'm a Burrito Boyz fan and while it's not the best food I've ever had, I still consider it a quintessential part of the Toronto experience."}
{"text":"I work right by this location and go often. At least on 2 occasions they've messed up my order."}
{"text":"All I can say is move over Chipotle, Burrito Boyz is way better than you! This is the best burrito I've had so far!! 

The staff seem young and upbeat but friendly regardless. I usually get a large burrito with everything in it. You also have the option of choosing between a white or whole wheat tortilla. Burritos you can order are: Chicken, Steak, Veggie Soy, Sweet Potato, Bean & Cheese, Shrimp, Haddock, and Halibut. My two personal favourites are the Chicken and Haddock burritos. They also have Chicken, Steak, Veggie Soy, Cheese, and Shrimp quesadillas. 

What I like about Burrito Boyz is how they lightly grill the tortilla giving it a hot and crunchy exterior. They're open really late from Thurs-Sat so I usually stop by whenever I'm hungry and craving a burrito."}
{"text":"After not having gone for a few years, it's good to know that it's just as good as I remember it.  Quality burritos done with care other chains can only dream of.

Coming in before noon, the lineup was already out the door, with many waiting around inside for the burritos to be grilled.  Unlike other places, they don't use a panini style press, instead going for a flat top and flipping it half way.  This makes a big difference, as the longer grilling time takes the cheese and melts it thoroughly throughout, so when you bite into it, the ingredients become one instead of tasting each of the individual bits.

I ordered a small bean and cheese (no meat) and honestly it's filling enough.  Washed it down with a Jumex Guava juice, and all is right.  Next time I come I would give the halibut a try, as that seems to be a favourite.

Minus one star for the loud shouting over the din of the crowd and the music, but food is top notch."}
{"text":"The last time I ate a burrito was after a Shuffle party and I was 20 something. It was the last time because I ordered it too spicy and it ruined the burrito. Too dabs of the sirracha and my stomach rebelled against me that night!

This time I remembered to say \"medium\" lol. We ordered the small chicken and medium steak burrito with everything and a side of nachos. 

First thoughts: chicken was better seasoned than the steak. Good call on putting everything! I should've added more burrito sauce. That cilantro though! 

After thought: good call on the nachos and salsa. Should've got my own order of nachos though. Size small burrito is definitely the best size to satisfy my hunger!

And satisfied is a good summary of my experience at Burrito Boyz. I remember a time when i LOVED burritos and I ate it every chance I got when I saw it on the menu. Pretty sure burritos and i have broken up now. I think I associated \"oooooh let's go eat here!\" Because of the memories I've had with burritos. I'm over it! 

Burrito Boys is good but I probably won't go back. I may consider it if I'm coming back from a late night somewhere or hangry after killing it in the gym. 

Happy to see it in Scarborough though! 'Bout damn time!"}
{"text":"Frankly, I am not blown away. The beans they put in my burrito were OH-SO delicious, but I broke out on my cheeks the next day which is a sure sign that it was way too much fat / oil. I don't know what they used to make those delicious beans, but I am not going back to eat there.

The guacamole was mixed with sour cream which gave it a weird taste, and it wasn't just plain, mashed avocados, which is what I was expecting.

The rest of the condiments were fine, but the tortilla wasn't as fresh as the one at Chipotle (sorry, but it's true). I've also had better fresh tortillas out of a package in Texas, the home of Tex-Mex, which puts this place to shame when I just make my own burrito.

I'd rather go to Chipotle to eat a burrito."}
{"text":"Great late night Mexican food! It's really nice to have a burrito boyz opening till 11 pm on weekdays.

Service is always fast here and really friendly.

The reason I didn't give 5 stars is due to the fact that their meat is sometimes very dry. I've been to other franchised locations and their steak and chicken is very moist. I find the steak and chicken here so dry that I can barely chew through it. The toppings are very fresh every time!

Hopefully the meat quality improves soon.

Overall great late night fast food restaurant for your Mexican food fix!"}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz! The food of choice for a city full of drunken college students.

Located down the street from the Richmond Street club scene Burrito Boyz has established itself as the go-to joint for good eats after a night of dancing and making it rain on bottle service in the VIP.

It's just good, quality food.
 I know it's not authentic - they throw all the cold toppings (lettuce, tomato, cheese, guacamole, peppers, beans...) in beforehand and then grill it up with the chicken on the side. It's probably not the best in town, but it's damn good for the money.

Between $5-12 you get a LARGE burrito. I mean big. I'm known for eating quite a bit and the regular size burrito did a great job filling me up.

All in all there isn't much more to say either than pretty decent food, at a decent price, in a pretty happening area.
It's not the best you're going to find around, but you should give it a try if you're hungry and walking by."}
{"text":"G dammmm, this place nailed as far as drunk late night spots go. Chipotle expcept more authentic"}
{"text":"Good food, but the wait for the food can be a little faster.  I like the option of ordering ahead of time, but it shouldn't take 30 minutes for a steak/shrimp burrito to be cooked and prepared.  I've had better experiences here in the past, so hopefully this was a one-time incident of slow service."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get burritos in Mississauga.  I would recommend going from 2:30pm - 5pm they have buy one get one half price. 

I also love that they are open late."}
{"text":"Eh.  Ordering was way too complex. I just want a burrito, not 20 options to go with it. Seating is limited. Was prepared for a quick in and out, didn't quite make the cut for me."}
{"text":"While the burritos are tasty, they are CONTAMINATED by CHEMICAL INFUSED THERMAL RECEIPT PAPER.  Note that when you place your order, the cashier pins a Bisphenol A infused receipt onto your tortilla.  This will give you a pretty good dose of a suspected carcinogenic and known endocrine disrupting chemical.  This paper should absolutely not be touching your food.

If you care about your health, best stay away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here in an attempt to answer the age old question of...can you get a good burrito in Canada? The answer is...sort of. The ordering process here is strange. You choose your burrito, the fillings (much like Chipotle) then rather than give it to you, they whisk it away to grill it up. At this point I had a moment of panic and felt like a parent who's newborn baby was being kidnapped.  Upon diving in, however I found the burrito to be pretty good. With the exception that the salsa and guacamole tasted like the pre packaged stuff. I can understand that it might be hard to find avocadoes in season but salsa? Really? Its not that hard to make some pico de gallo.."}
{"text":"Good fresh food and good portion. Fast service. A little warm inside and no patio. Clean place and tables are wiped clean."}
{"text":"Fast clean and friendly service. Good fresh food. Amazing burritos. Parking is a challenge @ lunch time. Plenty of friendly well trained staff."}
{"text":"Shrimp & haddock is great, clean space, service is quick and friendly, great for quick take out. Go easy with the hot sauce!!"}
{"text":"This location is my favourite in terms of food quality and taste. I get the shrimp and pan seared haddock naked burrito when I need something quick but tasty."}
{"text":"As a frequent guest at burrito Boyz (several locations) I sick to my regular; naked haddock and shrimp burrito. It's awesome!! This location is great, usually fairly busy but quick. The staff is always very friendly and work hard. I would've given them a 5* had a not watched one of the staff cough without covering their mouth (after I got my burrito of course lol)."}
{"text":"Had the veggie burrito recently, very bland and not worth the price, I can make much better.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Felt like I had to review this place given how good my late-night steak burrito and chicken quesadilla was and to comment on the customer service, which was just fine. I came here on a weekday night around 9pm and was surprised to find about 10 people in front of me in line/waiting for their burrito. However, there were 6 employees hard at work and within 10 minutes I received my order, which included personalization of what I wanted in my burrito and quesadilla. Yes, the workers are busy, but that doesn't mean the customer service is bad. Plus, the food was really really good - I just wish I had a place like this back at home."}
{"text":"Burrito Boys makes good food.  When my quesadilla and my son's burrrito was being made, it appeared they were skimping on the fillings.  However, when we received our food, it was clear that wasn't the case.

The food was fresh.  The shrimp chunks in the quesadilla could be found in every bite.  I wouldn't purchase extra sauces. A red and a white sauce accompany the quesadilla.  There is a white sauce which has a cilantro lime taste - DEEEEElicious!  It's the perfect match of flavors!

BB lost a star because the staff is ROWDY!  They yell & curse at each other with no regard to customers being present.  The staff is in need of training."}
{"text":"I was told that the type of burrito Burrito Boyz serves isn't really authentic simple because the burritos i'm used to isn't authentic in the first place.  When I finally tasted it, my first thought was, who cares?!  Screw that! this is delicious. And I say that considering I ordered spicy with canker sores to boot so I could not enjoy my meal to the maximum. There was a handicap.

Service was slower than I was hoping for but when it finally came, I knew why. Every item goes through some quality control so everything comes out consistent and perfectly toasted. I wouldn't say it's far better than Chipotle but it is better. It's in the running for best burrito I've tasted in the GTA though I haven't tasted a lot."}
{"text":"If you want the best burritos in the GTA, Burrito Boyz is where it's at and there's no question about that. They're open late, the service is great, and the burritos are huge and delicious.
 
For someone who knows that it's best to do so, I called ahead last night to place my order to avoid the lines that most customers usually have to endure. This location is always busy during weekends. I recommend you call ahead if you're getting take-out.

This is a restaurant that makes a mean burrito and knows a thing or two about service. Love the food, staff and the fact that this is a place that puts the customer first."}
{"text":"Great place to grab an awesome burrito. My sister really enjoys their nacho chips with guac and their house sauce.

Recently came here and got a loaded nachos (no meat) and yes, it was tasty but the hot cheese sauce wasn't very cheese-flavoured.. it was also a questionable dull orange colour.

I do enjoy the other items on their menu so I will definitely come back. They're also opened late so it's perfect for those late night cravings!"}
{"text":"Big burrito to settle those big burrito cravings.

Food: 5/5 Big. Always with everything on it. 
Service: 5/5 Fast and friendly.
Environment: 4/5 A bit dark.
Washrooms: ?/5 Missed it. 
Worth it?: 5/5 I don't always want a burrito but when I do...

This is my favorite place to squash that burrito craving. Okay, they are not that massive, I've always finished. They do leave me pretty full. 

I have yet to try a burrito bowl or quesidilla here. Maybe I will in the future. We'll see!"}
{"text":"The place to get some late night grub after clubbing in the entertainment district. This place is always packed every time I go. Huge burritos that come with guacamole for no extra charge.  To cater towards the late night crowd they even have an express burrito (no customizations) to speed up the orders. For under $10, it's a good eat that will 100% fill you up."}
{"text":"Great burritoyz good prices, quick service...

Great to grab a burrito after work but not so good at 2am as all the club drunks are around and the food quality goes down as the staff has to contend with drunk people."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz was the first and still the best of Toronto's Burrito grilling establishments. This is totally not a California burrito kind of thing to do. 
HOW TO BOYZ: 
Line up behind the people not holding numbers. Choose your size and meat (veg ground round is my favorite). 
Say: Large Veg
She will ask \"Lettuce, cheese, tomato?\" Tell her yes, all or ... no cheese
She will ask, \"Onions, peppers, jalapeno's\" Tell her No Jalapenos.
She will ask, \"Salsa, Guacamole\" YES- Guac is free!
She will ask, \"Sour cream, burrito sauce, hot sauce\" 
They really like the burrito sauce, so you should get that and the hot sauce rocks, too. 

Then you remember your number!!! Qual es tu numero? Pay, tell the cashier your number and wait for hot, melty goodness to come to you. 
EAT, ENJOY!

***************************************************************************
UPDATE: 
Due to a little split between the original 2 owners, this being the ORIGINAL location, Ian got to keep the location, but the other guy kept the name! So no longer is this BOYZ, this is now known as Burrito Bandidos. (Yeah, I wanted Burrito GIRLZ, too).  This place will stay my #1."}
{"text":"I eat here sometimes its ok.. This time my burrito has a few pieces of black metal in it. I will never eat here again as it almost cut the inside of my mouth!"}
{"text":"The burritos are HUGE and for it's size, the price is very affordable for a student. I typically cannot finish one on my own so I always share. 

I also like how it's opened late because there are not very many food places (besides pho) that is opened after 10PM. 

The only con wold be that the lineups are very long."}
{"text":"surprisingly my first time at this location, it was super busy with the lunch rush. 

I got the burrito bowl, and it was good.

I guess working downtown and having other options I wasn't wowed by the food.

it had decent flavour but wasn't excellent for me to give it a 5 star rating. would I come back? probably not, unless I was in the area and super hungry with no other options."}
{"text":"This place has to have the best burrito's in Toronto but that's my opinion! They are cheap in price, all the ingredients are included (no charging rediculous prices for guacamole etc here), the small is a big meal, service is quick, and all the staff are very friendly. It's open really late so that's a plus for after clubbing or drinking downtown.
Their guac, hot sauce, burrito sauce,  and baked beans are all home-made on site so it's fresh and VERY delicious!
Any of the burritos and a jumex or snapple = heaven.
The only real down side is there is very little seating but most people take their food to go since it's not a sit down kind of place."}
{"text":"I've never had a disappointing experience at Burrito Boyz. The bean and cheese is the best in the city, and I love that they keep cilantro separate for those of us that dislike it."}
{"text":"Their food is so very good. I call ahead to avoid the line up. Always friendly and accommodating. I have never had a bad experience here. The recipes are consistent too. Very few surprises."}
{"text":"Fast, relatively inexpensive, and fresh ingredients. 

The food here is excellent and the service is fast.

I've had a few things on the menu, but the steak burrito is my favourite. 

I keep going back again and again...."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz itself is my favorite take-out food on earth.  I tried the original Adelaide location in 2009 and was hooked immediately.  I left Ontario in 2013 and was back recently for a visit.  The Warden Ave location was the closest to me, so I figured I'd give it a try.  How lucky I was to arrive and find out it was the 1 yr anniversary for this spot and everything was half price!  :)  I had quite the cocktail flu that day and was feeling quite miserable, but knew coming here would help a lot, and it did.  I ordered the large sweet potato burrito on whole wheat and it was even bigger than I remember.  DELICIOUS!  Veggies, cheese, beans, rice, sauces...nom.  Staff are very friendly and highly competent here too (I've been to other similar joints where they are slow and make lots of mistakes, etc but not here).  Also, this location is much larger than any of the other BBoyz around town (I used to frequent the Queensway one the most during my last year in the city), but the Warden has at least a dozen tables for eating in if you wish.  I cannot get enough of this place.  Sad that I live a good 1000 KMs from one, but maybe that's for the best for my waistline.  lol"}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz are awesome. The portion sizes of their burritos are well known as massive and justifiably so! The toppings are fresh and you can customize your burritos exactly the way you want. And unlike some other burrito joints, everything is on display, not hidden behind the counter."}
{"text":"They reached out to me and apologized for the mess up . They deserve another chance as they're truly one of the better BBs"}
{"text":"Delicious burritos at a great price. Very cool hip atmosphere and the staff is super cool and friendly. Love coming here to grab a quit bite."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz North York is my go-to burritos near home. The quality is always excellent and you get a lot of bang for your buck. The staff here are super friendly and they know my boyfriend and I because we always go here after Crossfit. If it's your first time trying here, opt for the halibut/sweet potato mix burrito.. you won't regret it! Wait time is a little long like 10-15 mins max but it is worth the wait since they grill your burrito to perfection. You can also call ahead for a quick pickup."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM

Never heard of this place for my first couple of years in Toronto, but an old co-worker in 2009 mentioned it was a great place for lunch take-out downtown.  We went at the busy lunch hour and waited probably half an hour in a huge crowd, like we were fighting for concert tickets or something.  lol  I got the chicken burrito with everything on it and fell in love from the first visit.  

So big!  Even the small size is big.  So fresh and delicious.  You order in one line, keep your receipt, then they call out your receipt number to customize your burrito or quesadilla as you like (like Subway), then wait again for them to grill it.  Very casual atmosphere.  Well known for the after club drunk scene.  lol

If you go during \"off\" hours, eg mid-afternoon, the wait won't be so long.  And depending on the location, you may get a table to eat it there.  Some just have stools by the window, etc.  I now go to the Queensway location 90% of the time b/c it's close to home.  Average 10 minute wait.  I actually love waiting for it.  The smell of the place makes my mouth water.  

I've recently become vegetarian so now order the veggie soy burrito, which looks like ground beef.  It's fine.  I'd still prefer the chicken, but this totally satisfies, hence me still going there just as often.

I'd love to look into franchising a location of this place, that's how much I love it.  Maybe someday...."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burrito places I've ever been to, the food is fresh, the service is awesome and the way they grill the burrito makes it less messy and easy to hold.  I like the vegetarian burrito, it's hearty enough for a meat eater like me to enjoy."}
{"text":"More like a 4.5, but I'll round up. Had the small sweet potato, hot. I like that they have the sweet potato option, but the chunks of potato were a little too big and dense. Burrito Bandidos is spicier, so it narrowly beats here in my books. But good value, and Boyz definitely beats Bandidos on service. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent burritos, albeit in a somewhat dingy environment. Great value, extremely delicious."}
{"text":"I used to think the boyz really had it down pat but after waiting 15 mins at this location for the burrito to grill and getting a fishy smelling halibut the magic is gone. I think this location needs to get it's stride because the college st. one is really good."}
{"text":"Prices seem to have gone WAYYY UP in the last few months. Bad service as well.   Was a great spot when it first opened up. All downhill from there."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since it opened.  They've started charging $0.87 plus tax for guacamole - for that I would have expected more than a teaspoon of it.  Just felt like they slapped things together.  
Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Well I eat the food quite often but it's hit and miss sometimes it's good and more often it's not great."}

{"text":"5 motha sucka 5..

At Dis point you should already be in dis bitch, the rest of this is jus tips for the home boys and drunk girls. Live laugh and lift please. 


First thangs first. You know how us smarter folks hit up taco bell and avoid the tacos cuz we ain't want our toilets invaded by Godzilla breath and ass so we jus buy 3 supreme fries instead of those white people tacos. Well my ass learned that here too. 

Always just I learned in my life if it got a Q then trust it because it's just such a beautiful and majestic letter, Alphabets ain't the same witout dey Qing. Lol dad joke.. 

Anyways skip the burrito and get a qaisadilla however you spell dat. When you get axed what toppings and the sweet misses says the lettuce makes it soggy give her the chief keef nah and slap that shit on there (if you're eating there then it won't get soggy don't worry but if you buyin out then call up Andy and order some cuz lettuce like keys on a chain bruh. Then put what you desire and top it off with they hottest sauce.. If you're white it's gonna burn you..  If you're anything else it'll be bout as spicy as maple syrup. Don't be that one homie in the crew that got medium instead of hot sauce.. 

Now next they gonna give you 2 dipping sauces but HOLD UP Bruh. Tell the scrumptious white girl servin you to give you 2 white sauces or 2 burrito sauces.. That sounds suspect I know fam but I want to be leaf. 

Instructions on eatin..  Lawd.  You got 4 pieces, 2 of em for 1 dip. 2 of em for another.. Savor that shit. If you're one of those people who decided to get white instead of whole wheat bread you wanna go ahead find the nearest gabage and dash your whole meal in there. 

Oh it's 8 bucks. If you see the brotha wit the moustache workin in the back give him a wave, dudes a sweetheart. A burrito Boyz general one would call him.  

and ALWAYS say thanks to the staff when you leave. Even the grumpy Asian manager that scares the shit outta me."}
{"text":"One of my go-tos and all time favourite burrito joint. I've frequented the spot for years since it's opening up until I moved out of the province and it always seems to satisfy. 

I only gave it 3 stars because although satisfying and still delicious, the quality seems to have gone down quite a bit since past times. 

My go to is the chicken quesadilla (forget the salsa, double up on the burrito sauce) and I usually get mine mild. I once tried it spicy thinking I could handle it (I usually can handle a lot of spice) but they really do mean spicy.

Cant go wrong with good ol' comforting filling burrito boyz."}
{"text":"Sehr leckere Burritos mit frischen Zutaten. Es macht Spaß, beim Zubereiten zuzusehen. Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist für Toronto auch ok. Einziger kleiner Kritikpunkt: obwohl der Laden recht leer war, hat es etwas gedauert."}
{"text":"They do buy one get one half off from 3 until 6pm, I think. We got one large burrito and one large burrito bowl. Our order took a looooong time to be ready, so if you work nearby and want to pick one up for lunch, you might wanna call and place the order ahead of time.

The burrito was pretty big and the ratio of tortilla to filling was just right, and they toast it too so you get a crunchy texture to it. The heat from the toasting make all the ingredients inside warm up and compact together with the sauce.

The burrito bowl was slightly more food, but it missed the toasty heat factor, so the ingredients were kinda cold. It was still pretty good.

Between the protein options of chicken, steak and sweet potato, I liked chicken the best. You can get half and half of each option."}
{"text":"I LOVE BURRITO BOYZ.  It is my fix for late-night food where the only options tend to be fast food chains of the McD's and BK kind.  Call ahead for your order unless you don't mind waiting 15 minutes. I usually get the shrimp burrito -- ask for extra burrito sauce! 

Note - no debit here, cash and credit only.

BB definitely trumps Fat Bastard."}
{"text":"Really like the seafood burritto with everything in it. I only get filled up by a large. Never tried a bowl will do so next time."}
{"text":"I'm sure this isn't the first (and likely won't be the last) review I'll write for a Burrito Boyz location, but given that this is close to home and is my go to spot when driving home and I know I'll be eating on my own. I felt it warranted some review love.

Don't get me wrong, 3 star isn't a bad thing in this instance, it's an A-OK by Yelp standards, and after taking down a few hundred burritos in my life, they all start to taste the same. Nothing is really bad, nothing blows me away. Staff are surely, but on the whole friendly once I get them laughing with a few jokes.

If you've never had BB's before, go with a mix of proteins (chicken and beef, beef and shrimp, shrimp and chicken), but you likely have so you know what to expect.

Decent quick eats a a good price!
 
Eatcrest out!"}
{"text":"I'm anticipating some heat for this one, but my nick *is* Sapna 'Straight Up' G, and it's time to be straight up.

NOT the best burrito I've ever had. Not even close.

Ever since I first moved to Toronto, everyone raved (on and on) about Burrito Boyz. I just don't get it. I went, I tried, I couldn't finish, I didn't love, I didn't go back.

It's an alright burrito, and yes it's cheap and yes it's stupid filling, but so what? I've had better burritos at the food court down the street - and that's the truth.

I do appreciate the ambiance, I appreciate the pricing and I appreciate the experience of going to Burrito Boyz - but there are far better experiences  that I'd much rather have in life.

This girl *point to self* has had her fair share of burritos and trust me when I say that Burrito Boyz just isn't all that."}
{"text":"I love this burrito joint! I find it odd that it's across from Fat Bastard Burritos, which is its nemesis. I guess they're super competitive with one another... 

The service here is friendly! They always make sure you are acknowledged and take your order as quickly as possible.

I had a chicken and sweet potato burrito, and it was yummy! Nothing that would scream \"omg best freaking burrito in all of the GTA\", but it left my tummy and my taste buds quite satisfied. It had a good savoury flavour, and the chicken and sweet potato combo really kicked it up a notch. Might I mention that the portion was pretty hefty! I got full just about eating 70% of the burrito. It was inexpensive too...score!"}
{"text":"Love Burrito Boyz! Location is great, but wish it was open later on weekends, also, could use a tighter wrap on those rolls (bring in the Port credit team for wrap training!)"}
{"text":"First time here and heard lots of good reviews. 

Got the chicken burrito and my sister the fish. All in all just a great friendly place with great fresh food. I would recommend the small, you will get full or heck go for the large if you love food. 

Fresh, good all eating!"}
{"text":"Looking forward to this Toronto favorite of ours coming to Cottage Country.

Should be open within the month, just in time for warmer weather."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz is my fave burrito place to date.  They just do it right with their fresh ingredient and the right amount of spice. The burrito is big and tasty, I tried the chicken, steak and halibut ones and they all are good.  The place itself is small (around 5 tables) but pretty clean.  This place can get packed quickly and wait time can be long.  Will be back for more when I am in the area plus this place close super late for all you late nighters.

{"text":"This is definitely my FAV burrito joint in North York, and my review is a solid 3.5/5. 

I ordered the steak burrito (L) and my wife the chicken (S).

honestly, the only important things to know when you're craving a burrito:

- portions are generous for sure. So much so, that really a small is worth it more since it feels more like a medium. There isn't THAT much more in the large.

- salsa is extremely important to me in a burrito and if its not \"out of this world\" then the impression isnt quite memorable. Their HOT isnt crazy hot and it lacks flavor...just smokiness, so go for it if you want a bit of heat.

- staff are extremely friendly for sure. kudos to them here!

- vegetables are fresh and they give you really good ratios on meat to rice to veggies...doesnt taste overstuffed and bland because of veggies like it usually does from Subway!

All in all a great burrito place that's got a great price, staff and decent ingredients for when you need a burrito fixing!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always order a double portion of the meats (chicken + shrimp) and it's very filing - you might even consider sharing a burrito with someone else. Be wary this is is not gourmet by any means. Extra bonus, unlike Chipotle they don't charge extra for guac"}
{"text":"This is my first time going to a Burrito Boyz so this is soley based on my first impression and for this location!

I felt this is more of a grab-and-go type of chain but there were tables to sit and eat should you choose to.

Food was awesooooome! As much as I was tempted to try their burritos (given their name), the quesadilla was calling to me! It was deeelicious! I got the steak quesadilla and they loaded it well with steak, cheese, black beans, onions, peppers, tomatoes, and cilantro. There are condiments for you to choose from to put into your order and also 2 sauces you can choose to have on the side. The pita was nicely crisp and baked well! No complaints anywhere! Sure it was a bit oily but given the mix with the steak and cheese, it was understandable. High calories or not, I loved it! The portion was quite filling as well.

Service was fairly efficient. They divided the roles well and there were no confusions or overlap. Given the amount of customers that were in there, they went through orders at a reasonable pace. It was quite organized so that was on point as well. Would I go back or try a different location? Hells yes! I'd like to give their burritos a shot next time!"}
{"text":"There's 5 stars...and then there's Burrito Boyz.

Saying I like Burrito Boyz is a bit of an understatement.  I put them in a class of their own.  

Anytime someone asks me \"what's the best bang for your buck in Toronto?\"  I always say Burrito Boyz.  It's the best lunch in the City by far, regardless of price...and the fact that its cheaper than most lunches, makes it a huge bonus.  

I've tried other burritos.  Big Fat Burrito, Fat Bastard Burrito, Chino Locos, Chipotle, Burrito Bandidos...none of them match up.  The only one that's close would be Bandidos...and that would make sense because the owner used to be the co-owner of Burrito Boyz. 

My favourite is the halibut and the Shrimp/Steak mix (surf and turf!)."}

We had the chicken quesadillas with some topping but I couldnt add lettuce because they said that it would get soggy? Now who's problem is that mine or theirs? Mine if I wanted it way I should get it that way.

The prices were cool and the spot is prime for business. We also ordered chips and a drink.They didnt skimp on the meat. Thats something that chipolte does all of the time so that we good. I guess im loyal to chipolte ?"}
{"text":"It's taken me awhile to get around to writing the well deserved review about Burrito Boyz in Port Credit. You're probably wondering why I would even bother, given the fact that they've got locations all over and 'it's just another chain.'

This location is so much more than that as the current owners are a group of former employees who've taken it over and while maintaining the brand image have made it there own and made it a smashing success! I would challenge you to visit any day around lunch and not have to contend with a line up of hungry patrons. This place is crazy popular in PC!

My pro-tip: Do away with the standard chicken/beef/pork options and opt for something on the healthy side - ask for the pan fried hali (halibut) on a whole wheat tortilla as a healthy choice. They also have a sweet-potato burrito for you vegetarian fans who are tired of a tortilla filled with just veggie toppings!

Located on the north side of Stavebank off of Lakeshore"}
{"text":"Nice to have this Burrito joint near my work for a quick fix. The ingredient selection is nice and varied and my order was filled quickly. The price is decent enough with the small size around $7 and the large a few dollars more. I had the small one which wasn't quite filling enough so go for the large if you're really hungry. This is a solid restaurant with plenty of space to sit and relax with a modern look and clean lines. The parking space out front is very tight as everyone here drives so careful on your way in. I had to park on the street adjacent to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good for the price and fairly quick. Sometimes the meat is a little knobbly and you get those cartilage chunks but otherwise it's not pretty good."}
{"text":"Consistently good.  Get the naked burrito if you don't want to wait a long time during busy periods.  The shrimp burrito was a standout last time I tried it."}

The girl asked to take my order but completely ignored me the first time and then walked away from the counter after she asked me to take my order again. I had to repeat my order 3 times! All the employees seemed to assume that the customers are all regulars. They never told you the base toppings for the order. They don't know what spicy means because two dollops of their hot sauce isn't spicy."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz is where it's at! I usually go to the Adelaide location, however after coming here, I think I've found my new favourite spot! 

It is a lot smaller here as there is no seating available, so it would be a grab and go kinda thing. You could sit and eat at Yonge and Dundas Square, as there are tables, chairs and even a slanted area (where I sat). The line was not too bad, and our order came quite quickly. We ordered a small naked steak and chicken. Spicy level at a medium. 

I noticed that this location doesn't give as much rice as the Adelaide location, which I like better. As well, they give more guac and actually give you half a portion of each of the steak and chicken. Last time I ordered with medium spicy level, I couldn't taste anything. However, this time, I tasted it. 

If burritos are your thing, definitely give this location a try!"}
{"text":"I've been to various Burrito Boyz and this one has to be one of the better locations. The way they stuff their burritos is an ART. 
Hand's down best Burritos around."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. I love these guys. We're regulars to the point where they know our order when we walk in. The staff is great, they all work really well together and are always pleasant even on their busy days. Great group of people. Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm still fairly new to the burrito world however this was good.  First impression was very positive, nicely decorated and inviting. Unfortunately the server was rude and  anything but warm and friendly,  I almost left without ordering but I'm glad I stayed.  The burrito was better than expected  lots to fresh options and I like that they make it in front of you. I thought it a bit strange that they didn't want me to watch them make it, for me it adds to the experience.  They really pushed hard for me to sit down and not watch, of course I ignored her.  They have a good product, I really think they need to focus on customer service.

Update: Second visit and again, this has got to be the best you will find in quality and taste. If you know of a better place please share it with me. What I do find very unusual about this place is how hard they push you to sit down and not watch them make it.  The food assembly area is nicely laid out in front of you with bins full of delicious stuff and it lends itself well to being watched, yet they push you to go sit down.  Very annoying actually,go for the food and ignore them.

Update: Third time visit. Still the best and still don't want you to watch to the point of them being rude and unfriendly

This proves if the food is good, people will put up with just about anything."}
{"text":"Great little place, the staff are wonderful. Burritos are great value for the price and the chips and salsa are addictive."}
{"text":"Quality has gone down. Smaller portions than they were before. Slightly cheaper than other burrito joints and they're open late! 

Phone order going home from work late for a large bean and cheese burrito. Got the works on white tortilla, no heat. I remember a large bean and cheese from burrito Boyz being really filling, feeling like a brick, and tasting like how a burrito should taste. Mine was oddly skinny and I barely tasted any cheese, and it just lacked the usual burrito goodness. 

Used to be an old faithful but there are plenty of other delicious burrito places nearly."}
{"text":"Awesome place to take out burrito's. The portion size was enough for large, taste is very good and served hot.  Definitely a filler if you are around the corner and looking for some burrito fun!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Flavourful and whatever. But seriously $5 + for a cheese quesadilla?! Ridiculous. We also tried the veggie soy protein burrito- it was good and spicy enough for two people! 

My review is based on horrendous service from ONE server/food maker. He had given us our burrito, but when we asked him if it was possible to fill our WATER BOTTLE with tap water he said no \"we don't have any water\". Seriously I thought,  a restaurant without running water should be shut down.  It was hot outside, it was taste of little italy, moreover, we had spent $15 + on the meal. I was upset, but I didn't make a scene. But I wanted my dang water from the tap - we were paying customers after all. I came back in and asked The young lady who took our order to fill our bottle, she kindly obliged.

 Water is not something that should be denied EVER.  Whether its hot or cold outside - it's freaking tap water. AND I'm pretty sure there's a bylaw about this stuff."}
{"text":"I have been a long-time customer of Burrito Boyz and love their stuff. It's consistently made across all of its branches and has never let me down. The quesadillas are amazing too."}
{"text":"The portion is huge!! The vege are fresh. The taste is great! 

A place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Good burrito's. I usually get the chicken but the beef is also good. The portion is huge  and prices are very reasonable.  Only negative is the long lines, especially at lunch or when the bars close. (I prefer Chipotle burritos but their hours are not as good)"}
{"text":"Ask any Entertainment District clubber where they will be at 3 AM. attempting to sober up before they head off to slumber and you will hear 'Burrito Boyz' come up a tad too often.  

Why is that?

On Friday and Saturday nights, they are open till 4-5 AM.
The hole-in-the-wall restaurant can hardly fit 10 patrons, but that doesn't stop the crowds from lining up outside, regardless of the weather.  

Choose from chicken, steak, fish, shrimp or vegetarian (or mix up a few; I'm a fan of the Haddock and Chicken).  

Look at all those toppings choices!  
From homemade guacamole, to most vegetables you can think of.  The fresh shredded cheese is yummy, and spicy peppers are no slouch.  

Burrito Boyz knows exactly how to make a meal.  If you are new to Tex-Mex eating, or newly immigrated from down south, your taste buds will thank-you wholeheartedly!

Burrito Boyz is open Sunday-Thursday from 10:30am-11pm.  Staff are funky and friendly and patrons range from executives, to police officers, construction works to Goth kids.  Catering and pickup orders are popular.  

From all the burrito places in the city, Burrito Boyz is definitely, not to be passed up on."}
{"text":"Great burritos. Can be a little bit of a wait time if you go on busy nights but it's worth it. 

Big fan of the fish burritos which I thought sounded disgusting at first but after having one and realizing the fish was actually battered and fried I quickly changed my mind. Staff are all young and pretty cool as well."}
{"text":"I came here and got incredible halibut burrito. It was so enjoyable and the fish was spot on. It tasted so fresh. Cooked absolutely perfectly.  My son ordered the sweet potato burrito because he's on a veggie kick these days and I took a bite of it, and surprisingly it was phenomenal! I had never had a sweet potato burrito and it was amazing.  My son loved it as well, and wants to come back for more! The prices were excellent for how amazing the food is, and the burritos came out pretty fast."}
{"text":"Cool place and tasty burritos. Had a large halibut burrito with everything on it. Tasty but not quite as tasty as a fish taco I had a few weeks ago in San Diego. The others in my party had the bean&cheese and chicken and all were good and filling. Not much seating but fast turnover on tables so four or less can usually snag a table before your order is filled. A cold beer would have been perfect to wash down my jalapeño infused burrito but alas they are not licenced. Good value and satisfying for a quick lunch or to quell the late night munchies - yes. Exotic taste of SoCal burritoness - not quite."}
{"text":"Busy place. Good value open till late. Steak burrito really good"}
{"text":"FISH TACOS ARE THE BEST

The rest are alright but then nothing beats the Fish Tacos!!!

Too bad this location closes too early though.  End up going to Owl next door all the time...."}
{"text":"I found a large piece of plastic in my burrito. Some of the meat seems undercooked too. Be careful eating here."}
{"text":"True story! n it happened to me:

The 1st time i went in there was like 5~6 yrs back, at the peter st. location( now turned in to a burrito bandidos?!)
it was about 2 in the morning after clubbing. we were hungry n we see a line up out side of the place so we decided to join them. while we were in line, there were these guys in front of us chanting \"BURRITOS, BURRITOS, I LIKE IT A LOT!! BURRITOS, BURRITOS, I LIKE IT A LOT!!\" over n over...n eventually we all started chanting that...until it was our turn to order.
Now, usually that would probably be pretty annoying, but i guess everyone was drunk n hyper from clubbing no one thought it was weird. group chanting gave the place such a happy vibe!

so, i was left with fond memories of this place....hot food on a cold nite, happy group chanting, hip hop music etc etc. yea...that was a memorable experience....

now let's talk about the foooooood!
the 1st time i went i had steak, n bf had chicken.( i tend to pick the meatiest one on the menu) n they were great, yummy, juicy, good burritos, makes you want the go there everyday for lunch kind of good!
so of course we did. n this time i had the halibut n OMG so good i've yet to order another type since! ( i kept thinking i will next time i go in but i kept getting the halibut since i dun get to go often enough so i end up craving for the fish one everytime...) maybe its about time i try something new...i've been getting the fish for 5 yrs now...;/
so yea, if u like fish, n u like burritos, u will b very happy with the halibut burrito. 
oh n the reg. size is very filling, i can never finish one by myself.

so i've been to many of their locations n the staff is always pleasant n friendly. n every location taste just as yummy! 
oh n i tried the Burrito Bandidos place too....it tasted just like Burrito Boys....i'm not sure if its same people?? i've only had it once there but i liked it that one time i was there!

so now, for a little tiny bit of negativity (otherwise they woulda gotten a 5 star) 
and that is....it takes them toooooooooo long to make one!!!
maybe its necessary for a awesome burrito....but 10~ 15 mins wait...argggg...maybe the wait makes you crave it more?

recently i saw 2 more new locations opening in Mississauga, one is really close to my parents place! i can get it when ever i visit!! pretty confident that it'll be just as good as the other locations!


4.5 StAr! 
BURRITOS, BURRITOS, I LIKE IT A LOT!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here but it was surprisingly good will probably come here more often. About $10 for almost a pound of food can't go wrong with that"}
{"text":"They don't give you enough beans what's wrong with this place you ask for more and they tell you not supposed to do so what's wrong with extra beans"}
{"text":"People always say good things about this place but I've had it 3 times (twice downtown and once here) and have to say that I don't get the hype. 

My main beef with this place is that the \"steak\" burrito consists of anything but steak. It's more like really low grade mince meat. 

The chicken is a little better. But even then, the mixture of ingredients they add just doesn't seem to go well together. You can't really taste much because the sauces dominate. That would be ok if the sauces were tasty but it was fairly average"}
{"text":"I had only had burrito boys one other time- in the club district. I was not impressed I gotta say. 
This location however is really good- maybe the other location was having an 'off' day, or maybe my expectations were so low that I was impressed. I've been three times now, always on a Monday- and I love it. I've tried the chicken and the sweet potato. Both are delicious, but maybe because the sweet potato doesn't have a ton of flavor and presence, I feel like they could be a teeny bit more generous so I can really taste it. 
The staff are friendly and capable- they know their jobs and they all seem happy to be there. 

**Be warned- the hot is fucking hot.**"}
{"text":"Had my first burrito boys experience here last weekend... I was so excited- boy do I love burritos! 
The girl who made it was actually the best part of the whole thing. She was funny and nice- and made it 'to taste good' because I was a b.b.virgin...
But I gotta say- all of us were not impressed  with the burritos... They were bland. So bland. Nothing special. Big, sloppy, bland burritos. Yep.
I doubt I'll be back, there are other places in better locations id rather visit."}
{"text":"Burritos are a go to meal for me, when ever I eat out.
They're nutritious, economical, and perfect for on-the-go.

Burrito Boyz is always my first choice. I stop into different ones depending on which part of the Greater Toronto Area I'm in. This location continually impresses me with their prompt service, friendly demeanour, and, hands down, the best wrap skills in the business.

Quick story about today's visit:

Ordered by phone, then popped in to pick up. While doing so, there was a not-so-pleased patron who didn't quite enjoy his first couple of bites. As he was tossing his Burrito in the trash and rushing out the door, one of the employees acted quickly to solve the situation, offering to remake his burrito. They genuinely wanted him to leave satisfied. 

Quality product and top notch Service. They really want you to enjoy their food!"}
{"text":"I usually order a halibut burrito - everything  but no rice, extra black beans and xtra hot on whole wheat...sometimes deep fried and sometimes pan fried.  They are one of the only places to cook the fish burrito fresh.  Where as other places have them precooked and heat the whole burrito in the panini press.  Alot of people may think its just cheap drunkard food...but I have not been dissapointed yet with the freshness and taste.  Great bang for your buck when it comes to a fish burrito.  I have also experienced great Customer service at this location."}
{"text":"I ordered my usual at Burrito boyz - small halibut-everything-no rice-extra black beans and cilantro...hot on whole wheat.  Even though it is a brand new location they did it right.  They had plenty of staff and where cutting down the line really fast.  This location had about four tables and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I tried another location with projectile vomiting results so it's taken me years to dare to try again. This one is less grubby looking and the meal stayed put in my stomach. While grateful for that, I am seriously underwhelmed by this chicken burrito. Perhaps its magic is revealed in the wee hours of the morning after too much taste bud numbing draft beer.

The people are nice, the location clean and functional, the burritos ok"}
{"text":"First time at this location. Great service. As others noted, there's no place to sit. Great for take-out!"}
{"text":"Amazing burrito's! Burrito Boyz is probably your best bet at fast food. The location is always clean, and service is always fast! Burrito's range in price from $4-$11. There are about 14 seats inside, 7 tables, and three tables out front. Free pop's are offered during the week at lunch for students. I have always been satisfied by burrito boyz! There Veggie Soy, is amazing. The seasoning is delicious. Their guac is made fresh daily, along with vegan guac. Fish and shrimp is cooked on the spot! Though Burrito Boyz doesn't take debit they do offer an ATM with a charge of one dollar. A great spot for a filling meal!"}
{"text":"This burrito place has zero frills, but tasty food. You get a lot of food for the price. The best part is, it's not cheap food, it's decent.

Expect a nice big burrito that's tasty and worth the money. Expect nothing more and you will be satisfied.

Probably the best burrito in Toronto."}
{"text":"4 Stars.

I have reviewed the College location already, so I will keep it simple.

Great food.
Cheap prices.
No frills.

Expect more and you will be disappointed.  Expect less and you will be blown away. I have tried to go to other burrito places across the city and in other cities, but every time I always conclude, no one does a burrito better than Burrito Boyz; they have it down to a science.


That's it."}
{"text":"Decent place for a  takeout burrito or a burrito bowl on Dundas just east of Yonge. I had a large chicken burrito bowl with all the fixings. It was enough for two meals. Nice blend of spice, avocado, and tomato to go with the chicken."}
{"text":"Love the selection of different proteins compared to other places I've been. Long line ups sometimes, but worth the wait.

The XXX hot sauce is just what the doctor ordered to kick up any burrito.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This franchise location is located in a sea of Asian restaurants and stores which makes it stand out in a good way. Layout and decor of the Burrito Boyz should be familiar to everyone who has visited one. The location is open until midnight on Friday and Saturday for the partygoers and it was clean. 

I stopped in this location to quickly grab a takeout. I ordered a Steak and Chicken Naked Burrito. It wasn't very busy even though it was after 5pm on a Friday. Order was taken quickly and the dish was served promptly. 

If you are tired of eating Asian food, at least you have a place in mind where you can grab something different and it won't disappoint you. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"Went back a second time, I found the burrito to be decent again, but I'm finding their cash/prep staff to be seriously lacking customer service skills, standing at the cash waiting to be served, I smile I say hello and I just get a vacant stare, fine... i'm not sure if she is ready for my order or what but I went ahead and ordered my burrito...the girl who is reluctantly \"serving\" me seems too pre-occupied with the music playing and joking with the cook..., she rushes through prepping my burrito, and I ask for a bit more sour cream, which seemed to throw off her rhythm, she looks up at me obviously annoyed. I'm getting a \"I'm really too cool for this place\" vibe from the cash people, they just seem to be a fairly unfriendly lot in general. It's not horrible service, but you definitely get the feeling that they want you to hurry up and order so they can get back to dancing, goofing off and acting cool.  Its sad because I was very polite to her and found the lack of customer service quite annoying and unfair, now I'm not looking to be best friends with these people, but it would be nice to not get attitude, especially when you are being polite and friendly to them. 

My advice to them is, if you are too prideful, and think you're too cool for your job, give it up, quit and let someone that actually needs one and cares about being employed take your place. It's hard to want to return to a place where the people that make your food are annoyed because, they are making you food...

*** And to add, I even messaged the owner who previously complimented me on my first review, and told him about my disappointing experience, and of course, I got zero response, apparently they are only interested in positive reviews, they don't want to learn about or address their weaknesses. *** 

Too bad so sad.... I'm done, customer lost... for what it;s worth, Fat Bastard Burrito's are 1000x better anyway... they are more authentic and don't take 20 minutes to make... And they have fantastic customer service, they always seem to be happy and thankful to get your business.. unlike this place..."}
{"text":"Nothing remarkable, but in Brampton where the options for \"Mexican\" are limited, it's doable. 

Kind of dive-y atmosphere with very limited seating that's probably best for people looking for a late-night burrito fix. If you're craving a burrito earlier in the day, there are better options within a short driving distance (El Sombrero, for one).

Burritos are made fresh to order and are pretty large portions. Otherwise, menu is fairly limited (but so are most burrito joints)."}
{"text":"I've recently read a few back-and-forths from people who either praise Burrito Boyz till the cows come home, or from those who not only find them overrated as hell, but almost seem offended by that fact. 
Having not tried them before, but noticed they opened a location in B-town, I thought I'd give them a shot, as I love me a good burrito.

I'm just going to get the bad stuff out of the way. The lineup not only blew, but was completely incoherant. I couldn't tell if guys in the corner were waiting to figure out what they wanted to order, were waiting on an order, or had already ate and were hanging out. I'll go so far as to say that having any kind of table situation in a place like this is ridiculous. It only adds confusion and crowding. Get your food and get out, just as you would in Sonny's a few doors down.
I'm not going to complain about the wait for the food, because I'd rather it not be rushed. I will however complain about the attitude I received when I tried to get extra guacamole on my burrito, not realizing that you have to let them know when placing your order, so they can charge extra. Apparently i should have noticed the tiny awkwardly-placed sign noting such things. Oh well.

As for the burrito itself, for 8$ I got chicken, and it was huge, and I'd chosen many of the decent selection of items. Once I was out of there, things seemed much sunnier, and I could actually eat my burrito.

The verdict? Delicious! I refuse to argue authenticity, as I'm sure it's not, and I'm not a burrito expert by any means, but it was still the best burrito I've had in a long time. Perhaps when I try some of the other high-rated burrito places, I may change my mind. Until that day, I'd recommend BB!"}
{"text":"There isnt anything bad to say about Burrito Boyz, you are getting exactly what you expect...a great burrito. These are heavy burritos and i say the opposite of what you get at chipotle, stuffed with meat/rice/cheese whereas chipotle style feels lighter/fresher. But this is the burrito you eat when you are hungry.

I totally recommend the halibut burrito if you want to go all out, there is something about it which is just perfect. if you are being cost conscious then Steak is the way to go for something more traditional."}
{"text":"Had a chicken and steak burrito and a chicken Quesadilla. Neither of which were overly special that you would rant and rave that it's the best you've ever had. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either."}
{"text":"Called in and ordered ahead and was told that they were unaware of the time we would be showing up to pickup our order. This place definitely needs to figure out a better system. I understand the volume of customers they have and how packed it can get (line up out the door). However you'd think the place would be a bit more organized. Figure it out Burrito Bozo's"}
{"text":"Steak burritos are great.  Small is all you need.  Lots of fresh fillings.

Staff could be a bit more welcoming and not assume you know automatically how they do things.

However, hit with the kids.  I will return."}
{"text":"We pick up burritos at the Boyz queensway location every few weeks. No matter when we go here it's always busy. There portion sizes are great, I used to buy the large burrito but switched to small and wasn't any less full by the end of it. The burrito dipping sauce on the side for their quesadillas is so very delicious. I've run into a few gristly chicken pieces over the dozen or so times we've been here, but otherwise the food has been consistently good. Much preferred over Fat Bastard who are right across the street."}
{"text":"Veggie burrito is my favorite to eat but find it's inconsistent: can't beat the hot sauce though!"}
{"text":"Consistently the best burrito in Toronto. They grill the burrito into a magnificent roll of gooey, flavourful deliciousness. This place blows Chipotle out of the water; I have never understood why people enjoy eating cold burritos. The lines at Burrito Boyz can be long but they are definitely worth the wait. Surprisingly the soy burrito is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"This burrito could have been good if there was anything in it besides rice. Especially when I asked for everything but rice and no beans. I was hoping for a chicken burrito with lots of veggies. They had all sorts of fresh looking stuff like green peppers, tomatoes, onions, corn and lettuce. But none of these fresh items were to be found in our burritos. Especially not in mine.

My boyfriend ordered a chicken burrito with no beans. His had a few strips of chicken and lots of peppers and a few other veggies. He scooped most of the rice out because there was just too much.

My chicken burrito, despite having ordered it without rice, was nothing BUT rice with a few pitiful shards of chicken and a couple of jalapeño slices (since I asked for it extra spicy-- it wasn't).

I should have taken it back to the counter and explained the mistake, but I had a serious case of \"hanger\" and couldn't bear the thought of waiting another 15 minutes for a replacement burrito.

Honestly... I paid almost $20 for two tortillas, a few shreds of protein and more rice than I ever care to look at again.

Having said this, the burrito didn't taste bad, it was just very poor service and low value. Who wants a carb wrap with more carbs inside? I'm going to have to ride my bike for 2 days to work this shit off."}
{"text":"Alright, I love this place. Glad it's in Brampton.. Finally!!! New location, the only problem I found is this place has limited parking out front, but the back of Burrito Boyz has far more parking. My friend actually told me that this place just opened and we sped over. When we parked and walked inside, it was busy but the staff was ripping through orders like they usually do and were doing a great job picking up the pace. I grabbed the small chicken and shrimp burrito on brown and had two dots of hot sauce ( Some burrito assemblers have a heavy hand you know what I mean lol). Anyway I told the lady who was making my burrito for some extra guacamole and I forgot to pay for it. She was kind enough to say, \" I will try my best to put on a little extra for you\". I had that moment... \"Now that ladies and gentlemen is the real MVP.\" My friend and I grabbed two pops and waited for roughly 10-15 minutes. The inside of this place is spacious and there's a lot of seating for all group sizes. Burrito Boyz uses a numbering system which matches your receipt so when you hear your number, you jump up for joy. Now, when I took the first bite, it was perfection and that lady totally hooked it up with the guac *tear rolls down cheek. When eating, towards the end, the burrito always gets messy, the sauces and juices start leaking through the foil wrap but that doesn't stop me, I just throw everything in my mouth in the most unattractive way possible. All I can say is, if you want something filling, flavourful and fast (if you call in first) .. this is the place to be. Great location close to home!"}
{"text":"I have been comparing burritos all over the GTA and couple of states too, like LA & LV but I got to say, Burrito Boyz knows whats up. I had my very first steak burrito from here 8 years ago and I've loved it ever since. From that point on, doesn't matter how good the chicken, halibut, shrimp, bean or haddock was, but I always went back to my steak burrito. The staff at Burrito boyz are fast and friendly and make sure they serve the best burritos, that are jam packed with deliciousness each and every time. This location is usually the go-to place for myself and my friends either after a club or for a late night craving. To avoid line ups, I usually order over the phone and pick up, so I don't need to worry about parking either. When I want something quick and filling and mostly hella good, this is my spot :)"}
{"text":"I'd heard about Burrito Boyz long before my move to Toronto, and was happy that I spotted a location out running errands on this end of town.

I ended up with a small bean & cheese, so famished that I originally didn't ask for the actual bean part of my meal (fail). Luckily, the server kindly ran some over to the grill station. 

The small (1 lb, 2 oz) is a feast. I was a bit worried about the grilling aspect of the burrito, but it worked out perfectly. Perfect melt on the flavours. I appreciate that they don't charge 'extra' for toppings like guacamole. I was there in the middle of the afternoon on a Friday, and the place had a steady stream of people. Go. Now."}
{"text":"I find the people who work here all look like they have something to prove. They're also very hipster... I really don't know why everyone goes crazy for this place, the only good thing about it is that it is open late. Honestly though if it's not past 11pm go down the street to bar burrito - much better! Plus they have ground beef."}
{"text":"There's absolutely nothing that distinguishes Burrito Boyz burritos over all the other burrito places that follow the same format and share basically the same taste. There's a reason for that however, as their main income is probably drunk patrons who stumble in late at night, who want a cheap filling burrito. And that's exactly what this chain provides. I might have given 4.5/5 and marked it as 5/5, but one change a while back has caused me to rethink it, and that is making you pay for the guacamole. It used to be that the guac was free, but now that they started charging for it, it hurts my main purpose of eating here, which is a CHEAP meal. Due to this, I opt to forgo the guac every time, and it makes it feel like something is missing."}
{"text":"Burrito boyz has the best burritos in the city. The key to their success in my opinion is:

1. The number of ingredients. I haven't counted, but probably 15 different things go into your burrito. The result is an interesting new taste to each successive bite.
2. Proper construction. One of my pet peeves with burritos from other places is you often end up with a two-faced burrito - meat on the left, veggies on the right. Why can't they both just be friends? Burrito Boyz has a system of burrito assembly that produces a nice even mix of \"stuff\" in each bite.
3. Fresh cooking. Burrito Boyz cooks each burrito, rather than just wrapping up a bunch of ingredients and sending you on your way. This does cause long line-ups; they take about 10-15 minutes to cook each burrito (don't even think of going there after noon on a Friday - the queue is ridiculous!). Cooking the burrito gives it a nice crispy exterior and melts the cheese.

The steak could be a bit better; most burrito joints use actual steak whereas Burrito Boyz uses ground beef. It doesn't seem to hurt the taste too much. Burrito Boyz is one of the few fast food places that charges whole dollars for their wares - none of this $.99 bullshit. I'm glad someone has realized most people are smart enough to notice there isn't much difference between $7..99 and $8, and most of us don't like to walk around with a pocket full of change."}
{"text":"I have three words for this place...oh My gosh! That was an amazing burrito. Today was my first time here and I am gluten free. I walked in expecting to get a bowl because usually gluten free tortillas can withstand a good sized burrito. To my surprise they had gluten free burritos!!! Best BURRITO ever!! I will definitely be back. Also great staff and service!"}
{"text":"Food: 9/10 -- Value: 9/10 -- Service: 9/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: N/A

Call ahead. You still have to line up to pay when you get there, but your order will be ready for pickup if you tell them to start making it immediately when you call. If you must go in person, 11:45am is a safe time to be there to avoid the lunchtime rush.

If there is a crowd, keep in mind that most of the line you see is people waiting for the food, so squeeze through and order instead of waiting in an imaginary line. The line to order, even during the peak hours, is usually not that bad. 

I've ordered the small chicken, haddock, and halibut bowls and they were all filling portions.. Large would be super food coma full.

CHICKEN - Dry and not very flavourful. Chipotle's chicken is far superior in my opinion. 

HADDOCK - Soooooo good. Lightly and perfectly fried. Delicious. I've only ever ordered a small. Two out of three times, I got two pieces of fish. The third, I got one piece of fish.

HALIBUT - I'm not entirely confident what the difference between the haddock and halibut is. I'd have to eat them side by side to notice as a casual eater. I think maybe it's softer, more of a fish taste. I feel like Burrito Bandidos' halibut bowl tasted better.

You get more food than at Chipotle's and it comes with guacamole and a bunch of other toppings. At around $7.50, the small but super filling chicken bowl was a great deal. At $9, the small haddock bowl was so beautiful, crispy, and delicious. At $11, the halibut is good, but not so good that I'd pick it over the haddock for $2 extra dollars.

If you're into burritos and bowls, this place is great."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, good value; we'll always drop in! Parking completely blows though!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken burrito from here once and was very disappointed. It had bones in it even though the chicken was shredded. I would definitely recommend paying the extra $2 and ordering from a higher quality burrito company."}
{"text":"Had the Bowl with steak and chicken. Wow! They pack this container full of goodness. Great lunch for a great price!"}
{"text":"It's a quick service restaurant that deliver on portions, flavor, and (usually) quality. Why the five stars? The people working there are fantastic. They seem to enjoy each other's company, and keep calm regardless of the line up. 
Get the naked chicken bowl, or veggie soy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Burrito Boyz.. I have become an addict and had it two weekends in a row.. One rolled burrito and the next time I got a naked burrito.. Love the food and their quick service!"}
{"text":"I like Burrito Boyz' food quite well. It's been a go-to for burritos for quite some time now. The food is fresh, plentiful, and served quickly. 

Service is really important to me, though, and that's the main thing lacking here. My first couple of visits I didn't have the ordering routine down, and the staff were visibly impatient with me. I found their assistance to be a little too snarky to be truly called helpful. I'll say that since that time it's gotten a bit kinder--I mean, I still go there, so it's not totally turned me off--but it still has a \"you're not cool enough to be here\" vibe to me sometimes, and I never enjoy that. 

Given how good the food is, I am sure I'll continue to be a customer, but it would be more frequent if I felt more welcome in the establishment."}
{"text":"Tried the surf n turf, but all the burritos are great. Staff seems to be having a good time but counter staff doesn't really put any effort into greeting or pleasantries, which I've come to expect at most restaurants. Food is good though so definitely worth a try. The prices can get kinda high even for a small when compared to other places in streetsville serving similar style food"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak burrito, it was huge enough to share with my husband. It's too big for one person but not quite enough for 2 people. Wish we would've ordered one each. It was really good, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Location is not that great but the quality of food and at such a low price, it is worth the trip. The serving size are large with multiple fresh veggie options ( did the mention the incredible favour and taste). This is my usually go to place when I am looking for a quick, cheap and some what healthy food choice. The individuals working here are friendly and well trained."}
{"text":"Love burrito boyz but this location ticked me off. We ordered 2 chicken burritos and 1 chicken quesadilla. We got 1 beef burrito 1 chicken burrito and 1beef quesadilla. The burritos sat for 8 minutes before the quesadilla was started. No obvious reason. People were coming in after but leaving before us. Then the guy is getting ready to box up the quesadilla and stops mid way to go the back to change the radio station. That's when I yelled at him. His name was Mike and Mike was a dick.
No customer service at all. I know they're busy but he just screwed this one up and then was not apologetic in the least. Won't be back to this location again."}
{"text":"This is one of those reviews that don't need lots of words to describe the product.
We all know Burrito Boyz. Fresh ingredients with an excellent \"capital output ratio\": generous portions very well priced. It's my conviction that this is by far the healthiest, tastiest best deal in town for a fresh sandwich on the go. 

What I believe here it's worth to spend my lines for is the great quality in terms of service you receive. 
I tried several locations and this one along the one on Adelaide, I believe to be the best in quality and more importantly the service.

Always courteous, ready to help if you have questions (had an interesting situation with the use of the app when came out that was solved promptly with the highest customer service I ever experienced) and with a team that cares for the facility by making sure everything is clean, tidy and in good order.

One of the very few chain store that managed since its opening, to maintain the same quality and prices. Definitely a huge kudos to each store especially, the owner of the business!

Burrito Boys awards 4 stars only because now, if you want guacamole, you have to pay extra (thank god though, they don't charge as much as others... but I had preferred if they could keep the item free). 
If I would be the owner, I would enforce the following: no charge for the guacamole as long as people only get one scoop. You want extra, then you pay 1.20 instead of letting everyobody paying .80. 

; )"}
{"text":"ordered a naked burrito i enjoyed it.the reason for taking off the one star is because guacamole used to be free.I didn't get meat on my burrito so i feel like they could have added the guacamole for free.maybe that's something they could consider for the future.other than that everything was great!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Burrito Boys years ago at the Port Credit location (was that the original?)  Anyway back then that was your only option.  With new locations opening like mad I was worried about the quality taking a nose dive.  I am happy to report that isn't the case.. with a quick count of no less then 12 people waiting it is clear others agree.  The only downside is they are calling #9 while my number is 42!!  Ah well, at least it will be fresh.  My fav is the Hali Fish w/heat!

Edit:  Went home and tucked in, not sure what went wrong but was more on the dried herring side then halibut.  I asked myself what could have gone wrong.. maybe that huge lineup caused a disruption in their otherwise impeccable record??  I am going back again to investigate."}
{"text":"Not as good as original...  Definitely something is missing,  not as juicy.  But still good burrito and friendly staff.  I got a small haddock.  I am big guy and that filled me up for a good 3 to 4 hrs..."}
{"text":"Buritto Boyz beats any local fast-food Mexican spot in Toronto.  Expect to wait in a long line come 2-3am on a Friday or Saturday night after the club/bar, but the food is well-worth the wait.  I've ordered both the chicken and sweet potato burritos.  Both are tasty and seasoned well without too much salt.  

What I truly like about this place is that there are a variety of options, even gluten-free tortillas!  The price is always right; you can order a large chicken or sweet potato burrito with a combo (salsa and chips, a drink) for about $10.  To be honest, I would probably opt-out of the combo next time, as I felt the chips were a bit on the greasy side.

Great spot, great food, well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"what a BURRITO! 
the best of the best of the best (outside Texas)
The BIGGEST problem is they have 2-3 seating places, so during winter you have to eat outside or standing up with the crowd, that's waiting for their order."}
{"text":"Great service and great food the 2 times I have been in! I have the chicken and my wife has the shrimp. We will certainly be back. So glad to have this restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Massiveness of burritos! 

Halibut can taste bland if you are comparing it to the steak, but both are my favorite choices. Honestly, small and large aren't that much of a difference in size. Sauces are a must, pass on the rice or beans if you aren't looking to get overly full. I personally dont think a burrito is a burrito without one of the two, but since they are both starchy carbs be warned that you will get full much faster. Always busy at this location but service is quick."}
{"text":"The competition is on between Burrito Boyz and Fat Bastard, especially in this case as they have locations right across the street from each other. So what to do? Sample from both and compare, of course!
Simple judgement - Fat Bastard has bigger burritos, Burrito Boyz has better burritos. So it depends what you want - volume or quality.
Burrito Boyz has much more internal seating so you can have a seat while choking your heart with their tasty goodness. And that's the part that matters the most, the flavour. The toppings here are fresher, better tasting and better quality than across the street. Plus, if you're celiac and really need gluten free, they actually cook the burritos separately here to avoid the cross contamination that you get across the street.
For me, flavour and quality is more important than volume, so I come back to Burrito Boyz.
Added bonus: they're open til 4am on Saturday, so you can fulfill your munchie cravings, too!"}
{"text":"Burritos please!  One Naked Chicken $9.48 and a
Large Steak $9.88 burrito.

This small venue has a well coordinated order to preparation to cooking team; they rock!  Wait times vary depending on day/time but it's very reasonable.  Total bill was $24.33

There are a few table outdoors for seating or 4 counter spots indoors."}

{"text":"A year ago I came here and had my first burrito ever not counting Taco Bell and was not disappointed, been here several times since.

Everything that needs to be reviewed has been reviwed already so ill make this short.

Food: 5/5 - Its actually pretty big doesn't last me till the next day like some people but satisfying.
Recommendations Chicken, Beef, Veggie, Halibut - thats pretty much all the burritos but I think they have Shrimp now."}
{"text":"After moving from their previous location next door, there's a lot more space and definitely a lot more seats, so if you're thinking of dining in you have a better chance of getting a seat at this location.

Burrito Boyz gets busy. Seriously. If you're coming in for lunch, you'll likely be waiting among a horde of people. The lines are actually pretty fast, but it's the sheer volume of orders that they have to process that it looks like it's not moving. 

If you don't want to wait, you can place an order through their app or over the phone and then go and pick it up.

They offer burrito in the usual wrap, or a naked burrito which is just all the filling in a box.
Personally, I feel that the naked option comes with more food, but I haven't done any actual experiments to verify this claim. Either way, it's quite a lot of food.

I've tried most of the meat options so far and they were all pretty good. The amount of meat they give you is fairly generous, and you're paying about $10 for a large burrito! If you're not a big eater this might be good for two meals.

If you visit burrito boyz often, you may consider getting on their loyalty program which offers credits towards free burritos. Useful if you order in large groups."}
{"text":"If there's anything that I love more than cheese, it's a burrito... with tons of cheese in it. Oh, and really good customer service.

I've been fighting the Burrito Boyz hype for a really long time, but I caved in when a couple of my friends took me to the location in Port Credit. It's right off the main road, in a tiny little spot, but it was very convenient nonetheless.

We called our order in to avoid the anticipated lunchtime rush, but we were told that their computer system seemed to be down at the time. When we went in to pick our order up, it hadn't even been made because they said they had lost the ticket to our order. I was a bit hangry at this point, so I wasn't too impressed, but the (very attractive) man (with the cute face and tats) behind the counter, who seemed to be leading the whole team, surprised us with an extra chicken burrito for the really long wait :D (he said it was an accident, but I think he did it on purpose and he was awesome for doing that). 

Everyone working at Burrito Boyz that day was very friendly and super smiley... just like the guy with that cute face and tattoos. 

The food was excellent! I had the small chicken burrito... fully loaded with everything in it and it was just super flavorful. The chicken was so moist and tender and the toppings just complemented the whole burrito perfectly. My friends had the halibut and said that it was spot on- everytime. Doesn't matter if you don't like guac... just get it. It tastes awesome with their awesome burrito. Even though I had the small burrito, I felt as though I could have shared it with someone because it was so big and filling... so while we had the extra chicken burrito, I just couldn't eat it in the same day. Oh well, it tasted just as good the next day haha. 

Needless to say, I will be back. Definitely hit this place up if you're looking for something to fill you up for a few hours! And really, $6 for a small (really large) chicken burrito? You can't go wrong.

P.S. shoutout to the guy with the cute face and tattoos... for the free burrito. you, my friend, are awesome. A+ for customer service"}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to write a bad review, but after the experience we just had at Burrito Boyz Willowdale Location, I can't NOT. 

Let me start off by letting you know we are very frequent customers, the food is delicious no matter which way you cut it, even if it's cold. Although this location is still slightly newer, we have had our order either screwed up or waited for up to 1/2 for a burrito on more than 3 occasions.. The 4th and worst being tonight. 

We placed our order and waited an average to longer time of about 15 minutes, I didn't complain because it's pretty standard at this place so we've come to expect the wait. We finally got our food and went home to eat. Pulling Into the driveway I realize that 2/3 of our meals belong to someone else. Hungry and upset we call them , tell them we are coming back and that we'd like our meals comp'ed because everything is cold and we've wasted close to an hour. When we got there we asked that they make all 3 again because we have a 15 min drive Ahead and we paid for a hot dinner. 

They honoured the refund, however I was then asked 3 different times by 2 people what it was I wanted on my naked burritos, we then waited another 15 minutes.

This is the kicker... I got home and these people must think were idiots because both our halibut+ the haddock were room temperature and soggy. THEY DIDNT EVEN MAKE THEM AGAIN, They literally had us stand around while the two meals sat there after 45 minutes so they could make us a new chicken burrito and try to pass it all off as fresh. 

I'm so turned off of this place right now and it's really unfortunate because it's so convenient and delicious, I don't know that I can go back in at this point knowing that they have such poor service. It's not worth the headache."}
{"text":"Ok, this burrito is pretty good. Like.. If I were to get a burrito it would be this one.

I'm not that big into burritos anyway.
Get the small- the large is just unreasonably big."}
{"text":"There are tons of places in Toronto where you can get a burrito... but none of them will give you value, quality, and quantity at the same time.

This place is small, and only has a handful of seats, where you can enjoy your freshly prepared in front of your eyes burrito, but usually people come and go pretty quick, or don't even stay, but rather order to go.

Staff is very friendly, establishment is clean, and the food is prepared with high quality ingredients right in front of your eyes. Burritos are not really expensive, and they come in two sizes: small or large. Beware!... even the small one is big!... I once had a Large one for lunch, and I couldn't eat anything else until the next day."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have some great options to mix and match burritos. Their food is really fresh. I love the sauces they mix. Their prices are fair, about 10-15$ based on what you get. You do get a huge portion though, and its very filling. You get alot of protein for all the dishes. The steak dish we got was basically almost half a box of steak."}
{"text":"If you don't like Tex-Mex I have a feeling this place mind change your mind. 

If you like your burritos to resemble a spray can in size and shape this is the place to go.

Every thing is made fresh and right in front if you.

I have been coming here for some time and never had my order screwed up.

The fish burritos are great, don't like fish?!   
Have a steak or chicken they won't disappoint.

And did I mention all this for under $8"}

Although they are fast but there's a good line up!"}

{"text":"Oh hell yeah!!!!!

My first experience with a burrito place in Canada and we randomly walked into here, oh thank the universe for this perfectly placed dwelling for a dining adventure. 

Reasons why I love burrito boyz vs. international burrito chainz:

** Easy burrito ordering options. I don't have to be asked dozens of questions during the assembly of my food.

***They have fish!!! Real fish, real tasty fish. You can actually eat this and stand up straight afterwards....yummy fish!!!

*****They have a fresh selection of delicious beverages, gotta wash that food down with something other than soda

***Price, they hooked up a nice sized portion of food for a very reasonable price. A bit less than those international guys.

**That first bite!!! OMG, I thought I had hit every angle in my burrito eating experience, but baby was I wrong. It was packed full of flavor without tons of seasoning and retained the essence it's mexican upbringing. 

****I think the main reason it was so good was the fact they grill it, I have never seen this, heard of this, or had wet dreams about grilled burritos until now. I'm forever addicted and might have to move from Denver to Toronto and develop a long drawn out affair with the Burrito Boyz and their food...a healthy one to boot. 

******Last, they strategically use the letter Z in the name of their joint, which I'm a very big fan of. My passport might soon read Zhane instead of Shane.


Props Boyz, you dun good yo!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty fortunate to live around the corner from this guilty pleasure. Even the small burrito is so huge I can't finish it myself. I LOVE their hot sauce - it's pretty dangerous so a little goes a long way. There's something about it though that's SO much better than the hot sauce at any other burrito place. The fact that they grill the burrito really makes a pretty big difference when you're eating it. They also try to spread the toppings evenly so you have less of a \"my whole bite is only chicken or beans\" type of problem. Big Bang for your buc"}
{"text":"Looove their halibut burrito!  The portions are huge. Me and my sis shared a large burrito and it totally hit the spot for both of us."}
{"text":"I love burritos and I've heard good things about Burrito Boyz so this was my first time trying this place out. I ordered a large shrimp burrito which costed me $9.50 tax included and after devouring it, I was definitely full. I really like how they had a variety of free toppings including guac (YAY!) but it tends to make the burrito more saucy and less meaty (when compared to competing burrito stores like Fat Bastards). They gave a reasonable portion of shrimp and they were the nice large ones which accurately reflected it's price. 

Overall, the burrito was pretty good. My only criticism would be that it was rather cold when I received it and I would've had a much better experience had it been toasty warm on such a cold night."}
{"text":"This place is right by my internship so I tried it out yesterday. Super affordable for me since I got the bean and cheese burrito. I always love Burrito Boyz and this place is no exception. It did take longer than expected for just bean and cheese but it was delicious so that helped sooth the pain."}
{"text":"The single best burrito I've ever eaten. And only $6.75?? Insanity. The best late night snack decision is burrito boyz. 
In addition to serving great food, the staff were very professional. There was a couple drunk guys looking to fight and the staff was able to diffuse the situation quickly and without a mess."}
{"text":"You know that expression: \"less than the sum of its parts\"? I feel this applies directly to BB. All the ingredients seem present and fresh, but there's just not a terrific result when it actually comes to the eating. 

One key indicator for anything wrapped (burrito, Shawarma, etc...) is the quality and seasoning of the meat. In this case, the 'steak' is very mediocre in quality, not very tender or memorably seasoned. Same could be said about the chicken.

I like that they include guac in it, but that said - it isn't that great either. Even Bar Burrito 5 mins up the road is better, but probably don't do in a day what BB may get in an hour.

Certainly not poor, but a pretty definitive '3' if there ever was one."}
{"text":"Fine, friendly service like always. The girl who was providing the toppings was very good. I told her I didn't want corn and she let me know there was also corn in the rice which no one had ever done before. The burrito is always a great value for the size  they give. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken quesadilla and veg soy burrito. Fresh nacho chips with guacamole. Ordered small but was very filling. Couldn't finish the whole of quesadilla a lot of quantity. And loved the hot sauce. It's super spicy. Overall nice food!"}
{"text":"Good burritos, great staff. Always busy but it's worth the wait. Can't go wrong with this location."}
{"text":"I wish Burrito Boyz was Chipotle and had locations everywhere in NYC. It's 10x better with more toppings, larger portions and they don't charge for guacamole.  They even grill your burrito after it's all rolled up! The staff are all very nice, but then again all the Canadians I have encountered on this trip have been nice : )

Tip- must order the halibut! It's great in both a burrito or bowl. mmMmm

Tip 2- Remember to get some hot sauce on the side. It's spicy! and delicious."}
{"text":"Reasonable quality, good freshness, but high priced, and nothing remarkable or noteworthy. Would not make an effort to try again, would pick somewhere else"}
{"text":"Got to check this place out on the first day of it opening. Glad to see that we finally have a burrito place that is decent in the north York area. Staff was really friendly, food came out at a reasonable time. The space is a lot bigger so I feel like they could add more tables. Only problem is, you have to park on the street and that can be hard during the day. It was the first day so the staff didn't feel that comfortable yet but that should change soon as they get busier.

Stay away from the parking lot south of it, the security guard will chase you down."}
{"text":"Efficient bunch of people here. They know what to do and how to do it. Ordered here, had the order ready to go. Burrito Boyz in general are the best Burrito chain out there so far."}
{"text":"Amazing! I usually come here on Sunday for their happy hours between 3-5 pm. Buy 1 burrito and get the 2nd half price! Halibut is delicious. Big portions, the small burrito is massive. I can barely finish it! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I ordered a small steak burrito. The steak was hot and freshly made, the cheese was melted, and all the ingredients just blended together perfectly in a whole wheat wrap! 

Great prices too, cost a lot less than places like Chipotle and the guacomole is a free topping! No extra charge! :) 

My bf ordered a large chicken burrito, we compared both our burritos and there was no noticeable difference in the size! So I recommend just getting a small, it will definitely fill you up!"}
{"text":"Great place, plenty of seating. 
Was surprised how roomy the seating area was.

Ordered a small Steak Burrito Naked..... Was delicious, good portion size. Customer service was good.

About 6 minutes wait time. Which is pretty good.

Will recommend A+"}
{"text":"When moving to Canada, I was a bit apprehensive about the quality of Mexican food that I could find up north since there's a much smaller Latin@ population than in the states. Burrito Boyz is a solid place that's a grade above Chipotle in authenticity and a notch below in prices. They have a healthy selection of proteins / bases, including sweet potato and tofu for vegetarians / vegans, and seafood (including calamari), which is less common in Mexican food. They have all the standard toppings (rice, beans, veggies, salsa, etc.). They also have a burrito sauce that's like a spicy mayo sort of deal, and a pretty good hot sauce that is really potent (I got medium, which is three dots of it on there). I got a small steak burrito and was pretty impressed with the amount of meat that was in there. It was well-cooked, the tortilla was approaching crispiness, sufficient to not get soggy, but also flexible enough to avoid cracking and flaking off in pieces when you bite it. It can get pretty greasy inside, especially since all the juices run out of the veggies during cooking and mix with the meat juices.

The one knock I would say is that compared to guacamole that you can get in the US, theirs was a almost unrecognizable shade of green, which is understandable in the sense that avocados are not a Canadian crop, but nonetheless I had to ask to make sure that it wasn't some thicker green salsa. 

At least at this location, they have a $5.75 burrito + pop student lunch special between 11 and 3 on the weekdays."}
{"text":"I ordered a whole wheat cheese quesedilla. I also ordered a side of chips for 2.99 and sub it with guac for 0.99.

I got my quesedilla but not my chips. I only found out as I was walking back to work. I didn't want to go back since I'm running out of time for lunch plus it's a 30 min. Walk in total going back and forth. 

My quesedilla tastes good, but a little soggy. Well they had a super lunch rush and it was packed so I guess that's okay. 

I also like the dip that came with it. 

I'll be coming back because the price is reasonable and food is decent. However, my first order of quesedilla was pretty expensive ($10+) just cause I didn't get my chips and guac :("}
{"text":"Every time I come in for their food, I always leave satisfied.  They never disappointed me once,  and thats why I keep going back.  Burrito Boyz is one of the go-to places for lunch, dinner, or even a bite after a night on the town.  Good thing is they're open til pretty late too - bonus!

I've tried a few things on their menu, from your standard Chicken and/or Steak burritoes to their quesadillas, all of which are great choices.

The place is mainly for takeout though, there are a few tables but not enough to sit large groups.  If you go in with 3-4 people, you'll be fine, at least for this location.

Walk to the cash and make your order, they're efficient.  You'll be in and out in 10 minutes tops, note that they're usually BUSY!  You get a receipt with a number on it, they'll call it and you get to choose what toppings you want, type of beans, and level of spiciness.  Their spice levels are off the charts!  I usually just end up with mild,I go for medium when I feel adventurous.  Anything more, and I'll probably regret it later..

On to the actual food!
Their burritos are giant, stuffed, they load the toppings and the meat inside the thing.  It's crazy, and ends up being a mess whenever I eat it.  I tried it multiple times, there's no way to neatly eat one of these things.  Mind you, it's a hell of a ride, the burrito is really good.  Loads of flavour exploding in your mouth with every bite.  It's saucy and not dry.  Vegetables make it crunchy and you'll most likely be stuffed after eating it.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"- Burrito was not as clean as other restaurants. Didn't feel good after eating
- Had a lot of salt"}
{"text":"Don't use their online ordering service for 2 or more burritos during the afternoon off-peak period. If you go in person at this location you buy one get 2nd one for half price.(Sunday to Wednesday I think) The burritos here are ok but the fact that they dont let you know about their in-store specials even when you go there to pick-up after ordering and paying online is bad business. This wouldn't even have been an issue if the store employees/manager were empowered by their company to refund me the difference or even give me a coupon for a future purchase. The even worse part here is their reluctance to reply to my feedback until I sent them three. Unfortunately the response was a generic B/S \"we're sorry you had a bad experience and we appreciate your feedback\" but no offer to rectify the situation. Sad. When a business doesn't trust their own employees to deal with situations like this its indicative of a much, much larger problem. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Weekend staff always seem to off their game, but the weekday staff are solid. Great toppings but would ease up on getting all of the toppings all at once because I like to taste the main protein - if you get what I mean.

This only my own opinion, but lettuce? I find it weird to have soggy lettuce in my burrito and it tastes weird too.

Anyways. Halibut fish burritos - that's all I got to say."}
{"text":"Yummy and filling. I'm not a big burrito fan but this place made me love them just a little more. I've had tried the bean, chicken, steak, and halibut and I love the halibut. I don't know why they have a small and large size because the small is big enough to bust a gut. I can only imagine how big the large is!!

Lots of toppings to choose from but does not necessary mean to chose them all. One tip, keep it simple and neat. You want to be able to taste the burrito and not a whole bunch of different toppings. One topping I would suggest skipping is lettuce. It just seems wrong to have lettuce wrapped in a hot burrito. That's what peppers are for."}
{"text":"Popped in at the end of a long day to grab takeout for dinner. Great menu options for vegetarians, and lots of choices about fillings. Not a fancy place to eat in, but for fast and filling food, at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with their service speed. We ordered 2 large burrito and 1 naked burrito, we waited 25 mins to get our oder. 4 girls were working front and only 1 boy working in the back getting the food out of the grill. At least they got our order right.

This location only have 4 tables... Not many sitting area. Garbage was by the exit and it was over filled... no one cleaned up. 

Food taste great as always (possible because I was starving... ) But after, I had to drink lots of water. Not sure if it is the sauce or the marinated meat. Between the steak and chicken, steak is better!"}
{"text":"$10 burritos that will fill you for days. Good ingredients and very busy dive-y atmosphere. Pretty good. Good choices. Fish pork veggie beef etc.... hope they can keep the image as they expand."}
{"text":"Nice , very fresh ingredients the prices are equal with the size of the burritos , I love it for sure Ill go again"}
{"text":"Okay okay okay. I finally get what the hype is about. The burritos here are AMAAAAAAAAAZING.

I ordered a small chicken burrito, no dairy, extra spicy. Everything was to spec except for the \"small\" part. It was roughly the size of my stomach. And I just wanted a snack!

I liked their variety of toppings, and how fresh everything looked, not like the sad, pale veggies at Subway. I also like how they're not stingy with the guacamole. I can't have cheese, you can't deny me that avocado goodness, too!!

The burrito was incredibly tasty and all the staff was incredibly friendly. I got the feeling that they all really like working there. 

Seeing as my in-laws live right across the street, it's pretty likely I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Great consistency with almost every location!  I always get the Steak Burrito and it tastes oh so good every single time!  

Great place to go for after hours eats on weekends or if you are simply looking for a quick meal.  Staff is friendly and organized and they give you great options for toppings.

Burritos come in Large or Small and either size will gurantee that you are full.  They do not cheap out on ingredients which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Best Burito and quesidilla in GTA! 
If you can come back to a place so many times you can barely count, that just says it's really good and satisfying. 
I love their steak quesidilla in whole wheat with all the works and two lines of their house made hot sauce. 
Steak Burito is also another favourite of mine and is a staple when I feel like not cooking some dinner and just fancy a take out. 

The staff is friendly and they always make sure counter tops are always clean and replenished with their fresh and colourful ingredients. 

Make sure to order ahead for pick up as the place is Port Credit gets quite busy with line ups ."}
{"text":"Best burrito and quesadilla in town. I must have tried all the items in their menu and I keep coming back to my favourite steak quesadilla . Very minimal menu but portion is enough to keep you satisfied . They also have a naked Burrito if you want to skip the tortilla wrap. The place is tiny and can seat 5-6 on the ledge table . Make sure to call for pick up ahead of time during peak lunch and dinner hours as the que gets long. They always keep the counters clean and replenished . Ask for the house made hot sauce. 

One dot - mild
2 dots - medium 
One line - spicy 

*personally I go for 3 lines! . Fuego!"}
{"text":"I like the burritos but it takes way too long. I wont go in if there is more than 2 people in there. But its good food."}
{"text":"This is a superb place for your Mexican fill! Casual and informal with a few tables in the parking lot. The best burritos in the city with a range of options to suit all tastes. Their hot sauce is really tasty as is the guacamole. 
Don't let a line up put you off as they cook to order and are really efficient.
They are on Skip The Dishes etc so they keep busy. I live too close to this place!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican fast food. I got the bean and cheese burrito and it was amazing, grilled to perfection. It had just the right amount of filling in it and was really flavourful.

The place is usually very busy so expect to wait in line for 20-30 minutes before you can order unless you call in your order. Still, the food here is somewhat healthy so its a great place to grab a quick lunch or dinner between classes."}
{"text":"Been looking for a Mexican place to dine in for a while now since moving from California and this place did not disappoint. Perfect for a college students appetite and budget. A large burrito combo for around ten bucks is too good to be true. And when they say large it's LARGE. 

Works similar to chipotle. You order, your number gets called, and you give directions to the employee on how you want your burrito. 

You can mix a maximum of two meats but you pay the higher price (Chicken and sweet potato burrito will be the same price as a chicken burrito). 

One unique thing I noticed was their hot sauce! They only put dots but it definitely works! For those people seekin for a bigger kick, ask for a line of sauce instead of just dots."}
{"text":"Great burritos. Very happy I no longer have to head downtown for one of these.  Portions are huge, and fair prices. They use quality ingredients and the staff are friendly. Same love and care go into the burritos here as they do at the downtown locations. 100x better then fat Bastard across the street. After my first try there and throwing half of it out I gave up on Scarborough burrito joints until these guys opened up.  Glad to see a spot that shows fat Bastard how a burrito is done"}
{"text":"Burritos here are pretty good! I like the toasted wrap, which gives it a crunch when you bite into it. Another plus is that they don't charge extra for guac. Oh! And you can mix two fillings which is pretty cool. But in the end, I'd go for Chipotle or Fat Bastard Burrito Co any day over Burrito Boyz. Comparatively, it's just missing that oomph flavour-wise.

Have had Burrito Boyz a number of times. Tried the haddock, chicken, mix of haddock and calamari. The seafood doesn't taste that fresh, I'd probably stick with the chicken or steak.

Great go-to when you're super hungry! Portions are huuuuge."}
{"text":"Previous occasions I've stuck with chicken or beef burritos and have always been disappointed.  Nothing special about these 2 whatsoever, not worth the obligatory 20 min wait.

Then I had the Halibut burrito which was completely unstoppable.  If you like fish sandwiches, this is an incredible combination of textures, flavours and sauces.  Fantastic from beginning to end and I wanted more despite being stuffed.  Only reason I'd go back."}
{"text":"Quantity meets Quality.

Thank you Burrito Boyz for making my afternoon nap last all night.  I had the biggest food coma you can imagine after finishing a whole Halibut LARGE burrito.  It was worth every penny and stretch mark.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Their burritos, quiesadilla and bowls are cheaper and more neatly arranged than Chipotle in that your sandwich isn't falling apart and sauce isn't oozing all over the place (Chipotle can be sloppy sometimes), however the food wasn't up to par in my opinion. Ingredients seem fresher than Chipotle, though. A decent quick bite with my coworkers, but there's nothing outstanding that would bring me back tbh. P.S. Spicy means spicy and they're not kidding around, so don't order it if you can't handle it. My coworker was sweating buckets LOL... *3.5 stars*"}
{"text":"Great price! Great food! It's a little on the slow side but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Please note that this review is based on my mealpal experience and thus shouldn't be mixed up with your experiences purchasing items at regular price.  I ordered the steak and sweet potato burrito for an 11:30 am pick up.  Once, I arrived, I was immediately directed to the counter for my pick up and was able to bypass the lineup of customers. The cashier was very friendly and fluid with her transaction, so was very clear that workers here are extremely efficient with their mealpal process.  The burrito that I received was labeled with a receipt for a 12 noon pick-up, however.  What this suggested was that they pre-make their burritos at least 30 mins before the pick up time.  Pre-making orders isn't uncommon in the realm of Mealpal, but it does make for a softer and soggier burrito.  My burrito had guacamole alongside the sweet potato paste, so I can assure you that every bite was void of any crunch and crispness. The steak itself was desolate of any strong flavours and the pastes were overwhelmingly bland. Portion-wise, it is somewhat filling for a Mealpal dish.  Nonetheless, even at a great price of 5 dollars, I don't see myself becoming a regular here.  You're much better off going to  Mucho Burrito for their mealpal burrito bowls."}
{"text":"People at work keep talking about this place saying they have the best burritos in town. Finally had it about a week ago, ordered a Steak Burrito, it was pretty good. Unlike other cheesy burrito place that gives you ground beef, You get chunks and chunks of real steak here. It was good but it wasn't mind-blowing good. 

Decided to give this place another try today. I ordered the Halibut Burrito, OMG.... It blew my mind!! The fish was crunchy and flaky. The ingredients are so fresh and the XXXtra Hot Sauce is awesome! I would definitely come back for more!!"}
{"text":"Hangover food of choice tonight - Burrito Boyz!  Had a small halibut burrito to share.

Generous generous portion sizes... I seriously don't know how people can eat a large!  Just half of a small was a meal for me!  The halibut burrito is my all-time favourite. The fish is very tender and juicy! I also like that they give you the whole wheat option on the wrap! I got my burrito with all the fixings: guacamole, lettuce, tomato, rice, jalapeño, medium hot sauce, and beans.

Gorilla Sprinkles got a steak burrito which he enjoyed!

My only \"beef\" was that they wouldn't cut it in half for me because \"we can't we're too busy.\" so deduct one star."}
{"text":"Omg. Cheap and healthy and amazing. Call ahead because this place is always packed no matter what time of day. 
My fav is the sweet potato and chicken.... so good. If you haven't been yet this place is the real deal. This is the ultimate burrito joint and for 8 bucks you'll be stuffed . 
This is the original burrito place
...often imitated but never duplicated."}
{"text":"Yum!

If you're looking for authentic Mexican fare, Burrito Boyz is not what your'e looking for.

Though it is the \"it\" place to go after a night of partying, I actually come here for lunch and sometimes when I'm too lazy to make my own dinner.

This Tex-Mex joint  serves fresh ingredients, customized to your liking.  You can choose your stuffing of vegetables, and sauces, and my personal favourite is the veggie-meat stuffing.

They finish it off on the grill so when you open your burrito and take your bite, you get the experience of the cheese-melt....oooohhhhh!!!

The staff there are quick, but be warned that if there is a line inside, you will be waiting for at least 10-15 minutes before you get your burrito in your hand.

The staff are nice and are quick at burrito-making, but at the same time have the hipster-too-cool attitude. I still would say the customer service is at least satisfactory, since I'm looking more for a fast turnaround and less concerned personable staff.

Would I say to give it a try? Yes.  Is it somewhere I will come back to every once in a while?  Definitely.  Is it the best burrito in town?  Probably not, but I haven't tried a better one in Toronto.

A-OK."}
{"text":"Always good and open late. You get a lot of food even if its a little pricey."}
{"text":"First time here, and I ordered a naked burrito. I didn't have high expectations with this place because of the hype, but I was surprised at how all the ingredients were beautifully placed. They have a calorie count for most of their items on the board, and for a girl counting her calories, I really appreciate the separate board for the calorie count of the toppings. The portion was big for ordering a small and it was very fulfilling."}
{"text":"This review is 4.5. I'm taking off .5 stars because I prefer the taste of Chipotle's chicken. However, this place has way more variety.
There are vegetarian options. They can do a make burrito, which is a deconstructed burrito in a container, as opposed to wrapped in a tortilla.
I have the small, naked chicken burrito. A small is 4 oz of meat/protein. A large is 6 oz.
My only criticism is when the burrito is done and served, everything is in two layers. The rice, cheese and meat on one side and the veggies and salsa on the other side. I'd like everything to be mixed together. It was very difficult attempting mix it all myself because the cheese had melted into the rice.
Important to note that while they don't give you as much guacamole as I'd like, they also don't charge you extra!
I'll definitely be back. I'd like to try some of the other protein options, maybe sweet potato? But to compare the chicken, I prefer Chipotle. Even though I get more here for less the price..."}
{"text":"I love burritos, they're probably my favorite thing in the whole wide world! Burrito Boyz wasn't that great, though. I visited Burrito Boyz because of it's no more than 5 minutes from where I live. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed with my food. The flavors just weren't there, I don't know what else to say. The meat doesn't have any flavor and the sauces aren't flavorful, they're just spicy. I guess I've got really high standards when it comes to Mexican fare since I'm from California. 

Most Canada burritos are just not that great. Sorry Canada!"}
{"text":"Great food Great Price and always open reallY late !

My recommendations are the Chicken or the Steak Quesadilla, It comes with two sauces i always go for the Salsa and the Sour cream. It cost around 9$. The staff is also friendly and quite fast too."}
{"text":"Best ever!!!!  Simply said that's it. I have been to all burrito places in the downtown area (I think) and this place has set the bar. If you're new or visiting Toronto go here!!!  When talking in groups there's always someone that hasn't been there and the reply is always  \"You've never been!?!?!?\"
Just go, see, believe....."}
{"text":"I've had pretty much all my burritos, which is not many to begin with, in the states. Now I generally enjoy them but don't have major cravings for them. 
In between appointments my SO and I wanted something quick and were in the College area. 
First of I was glad they had a \"small\" version of the burrito as I normally find them too big for one to consume as a meal and often have to split. 
The toppings were good but nothing to be blown away from. 

In the process of ordering our burrito I realized we did not get a parking slip, as I left my burrito on the grill I ran back to the car (about a 5 min quick walk). 

I rushed back and was excited to have a burrito in Toronto, only to find my SO still waiting for the slow grill to warm up our burritos. And everyone else in there was waiting for theirs to warm up as well. 
Why not get a double sided grill and cut down waiting time and be able to serve your customers quicker? It's not rocket science. 

The burrito it self was just A-OK and I don't think I will return, but if you are a germ-freak you will be glad to know that the servers washed hands or changed gloves about 3 times on just our burritos, we were kind of impressed as sad as that sounds."}
{"text":"All 5 star raters have never tried Chipotle Mexican Grill...."}
{"text":"Awesome little joint! It's pretty cheap and there burritos are huge and yummy! Had the chicken burrito, have so many topping options Check it out if your in the area!!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing.

best burrito ive ever had.

only downfall. every time i go at lunch, the line up for service is crazy."}
{"text":"We came here for burritos. For vegans they have a tofu burrito and a cheaper bean burrito. We ordered one of each (no cheese, vegan sauce only) and we split them. 

Service wise everyone was a slacker with the exception of one lady who was pretty much running the whole show. That lady told me she will give me free guac as a substitute for cheese which is always appreciated.

Both burritos were delicious, but keep in mind that beans come standard on every burrito, so the bean burrito is basically a burrito with toppings only. Price wise it's cheaper than the average burrito place. Overall it was a great experience. I recommend the tofu burrito if you like tofu and don't mind spending few extra bucks."}
{"text":"I had a seriously amazing burrito.  I was already full when we walked in but my friends insisted that I buy one to go so that I could enjoy the awesomeness of their food.  I was skeptical but I bought one.

I went up to the register and said I wanted a veggie burrito to go, and started telling the cashier the toppings I wanted.  The cashier was surly as all hell and rudely told me that I was giving the order wrong - I had to give the toppings to someone else to put in, or something.  I was confused and when I asked her to clarify, she rolled her eyes and explained it to me quicker than I could parse the information, so I made her tell me again.  She was fuming by the end of it, even though it was my first time there and I just wanted to know how the hell they ran their business.  In fact all the staff were surly.  That's where the missing stars come in.  I get it, people have bad days, but keep your emotional baggage at home, will you?  I never understand this in any business - do you not like having customers?  Do you want me to associate your establishment with being mad or being treated poorly?  Apart from my having made their lives difficult for them, I'd have given 5 stars, as the food was great.

Anyway, the burrito I got was huge.  The person who put toppings didn't really get the concept of vegan toppings so I had to explain it to her - another mad person - and after what seemed like 20 minutes I had my burrito.  My friends and I laughed at how they were Seinfeld's version of the Soup Nazi - the Burrito Nazis.  Anyway, I didn't eat it for another 5 hours because I wasn't hungry yet.  When I did eat it, it tasted great.  The food was seriously worth the hassle in the end."}
{"text":"Good shit! Get Steak and chicken combined you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had another burrito that's as tasty as Burrito Boyz.  

I've been coming here for years, especially during the late night. I think throughout the years they have been perfecting the efficiency of their creation without making you seem like a fool and feeling rushed.

The menu on the website and on the chalkboard in the resto, is clear and you can figure out everything that you would want and be prepared before stepping up to the counter. But, if you're not ready the friendly staff will guide you through it quickly and efficiently, just like the rest of their operation.

At lunch time it gets busy. It starts around 11:30, and the place gets packed. It's at least 15 mins wait. 

I would suggest calling in with your order, and ask it to be ready at a certain time.  Their website will clearly show you what you need to ask/tell them about your order.  You'll step right up to the cash, and they will give it to you and you can pay with cash, debit or credit.  It was so fast when I went to pick it up that I think I was in there for less than 2 minutes. 

The halibut I tired for the first time the other day, and although good, it was also a $2 more than the regular chicken/steak version. But with so many fillings, I barely tasted the halibut. 

Note to self: Spicy is quite spicy, especially with jalapenos

Chicken/Steak is $8 for a large including taxes
Halibut is $10 for a small. 
All toppings doesn't cost extra, unless you ask for an extra scoop of the same thing."}
{"text":"Have been there many times and almost never disappointed. The location on Dundas and Winston Churchill I am a few times. But not at this location. 

Took our usual - a Large Naked Veggie Soy and a small beans cheese. The naked burrito is great light meal and the small burrito as well. The small fills me up as well. 

The location was packed for the supper hour, but the service was quick. The food nice and good quality at a reasonable price. 

Saw someone pick up a nacho- seemed good. Next time for sure"}
{"text":"Picked up the usual Veggie Soy Quesadilla, Naked Veggie Soy, a beans and no-cheese Burrito and for the first time a Veggie Soy Nachos. 

As usual, the food is perfect, the Quesadillas are stuffed perfectly, the. Ales is filled as per our specifications and burritos without cheese, sour cream and burrito sauce tasted just perfect. Perhaps the four lines of hot sauce makes it good. But needless to say they are done the best. 

The nachos, are filled to the brim with toppings and actually quite hard to pick up and eat. Just as the burritos and quesadillas are. The only negative is the ratio of chips is low compared to the toppings. But fun to eat. We tried with with cheese sauce. The cheese sauce is OK. As this was first time, decided to try with cheese sauce. It is NOT Cheez Wiz but still lacked cheese flavour. Next time it will be shredded cheese. 

The staff are amazing. The place clean, prices are reasonable and food amazing. - what else could one ask for?"}
{"text":"Honestly, Burrito Boyz blows Chipotle out of the water when it comes to tex-mex. Not only are they cheaper, they also taste better! I've frequented this joint so many times to feed my gf and I that I've lost count. Portion-wise they ALSO trump Chipotle tremendously (Chipotle is a ripoff). My go-to order is usually a large naked burrito with chicken and/or steak

Now recently my girlfriend downloaded the burrito boyz app and paid thru it. Upon arriving for pickup, they notified me that the order had been backlogged into the database but had not officially been registered into the store's system. The manager rectified it instantly by giving me two complimentary free burritos for my next visit in addition to making the food we had already paid for (+ 1 for exceptional customer service).

Seeing as there aren't many good tex mex options outside of Chipotle and Burrito Boyz. Do yourself a favor and go to Burrito Boyz. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of Burrito Boyz a couple years ago when locations started popping up everywhere but as of lately - meh. I found my steak burrito to be nothing special compared to what it used to be. On top of that, the employees really are just a bunch of high school kiddies prancing around. I get it, it's a laid back kinda joint but the line should be drawn somewhere. There's more professionalism at McD's than here."}
{"text":"Updated 2018-01-20
Bad service. Unbelievably the quantity was horrible. Even though the prices for avocados are normal, the extra charge remains and I get is a loonie size drop. Somehow the taste wasn't up to the mark as well. BB - there is a new competitor in town (FB), if this continues my $s go somewhere else. (Removed two stars - they will have to earn it back)



Was hoping to go to the Streetsville location, but as this was on my there remembered that there was Santa Claus parade so did a quick detour and reached at the Meadowvale location. 

The place is much better than any of the other BB locations we have been to. There is more light because of the corner location and has many tables than other sites. 

The staff were friendly and quick and the order quickly served. Although did a takeaway, would definitely come back at this location as well. 

The two naked veggie soy burritos were on the mark (as usual). The flavours, quantity and price right. 5/5"}
{"text":"I really like Burrito Boyz.  As a filling meal, it's affordable at around 7-9 bucks depending on the protein you choose and size of burrito/quesadilla. Similar to Chipotle, there's chicken, beef, shrimp, fish, beans, and sweet potato options as filling and then you top it the way you want from the fresh ingredients they have.
I usually go for a naked steak (no tortilla) so it comes in a container with all the stuff in a burrito- making it a burrito bowl of sorts. 

For the price, the portions and taste- I have to recommend this franchise to anyone looking for a good burrito. It's always fresh, made to order and super tasty!

The wait can be a bit long if there are people in que- they grill and press the burritos for a while, so have patience. The naked option takes no time at all."}
{"text":"The best burrito place in town! Fresh ingredients and plenty of toppings in your burrito. Small is big enough to share. It's always busy so call ahead for quick pick up."}
{"text":"Delish!! Ordered 2 bean burritos and they were amazing - fresh ingredients and perfectly grilled. They need a larger sign so people see the restaurant"}
{"text":"OMG! If you like Mexican and Money,  then this is the place... The food/ingredients are fresh, the music is bumping, service is quick and friendly, atmosphere is casual and best of all, you get the most bang for your buck.  It starts at $5.50 taxes in! You can even place an order before picking up... Otherwise it's about 5-10 min wait... I love to be there and watch my food being prepared. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Love them.  Sometimes they get my order wrong.  The staff is cool, the food is fresh.  Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went today small burrito   halibut.
Toppings all fresh .Don't know how you could eat a large.Was able to get parking today, lot is small.
My order was taken immediately worth the wait to have it hot and fresh.
Expanded dining area since I was there took over next door 
I love the halibut 
You can call for pickup wait is shorter."}
{"text":"Fast working and efficient. Good seeing the crew running a tight ship.

Enjoyed my juicy steak burrito. The wrap had a nice crispy texture after coming off the grill. However it wasn't spicy enough, even though I asked for super hot! Will come back to try the bowl and other burritos."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer since this location's opening. Unfortunately, I've noticed meat/SP portions become smaller and smaller on the naked burritos. It'd be nice to see it return to its original, generous portions that brought so much loyalty."}
{"text":"Got the small chicken burrito. Very filling and delicious. Worth the money!! I would go back whenever I crave Mexican food. They don't disappoint! Only downfall is that it takes them a bit of time to make."}
{"text":"Now I love burritos! If I see a new burrito place I'm on it like sonic! So seeing I have yet to try Burrito Boyz, I thought I would pop in to try some goodness.

Slightly disappointed after reading all the reviews on yelp and such. I ordered the small chicken burrito on whole wheat. It was extremely cheesy, like at some points way to much cheese! But, who doesn't like cheese right? I'm not a fan of the taste, it seems to bitter for my liking and not enough balance with ingredients. I waited for awhile, granted it was slightly busy but not busy enough that it took 15 minutes for a burrito to be put on the grill! 

Final verdict? It's alright but it wouldn't be my first choice for some burrito goodness."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of people complain about Burrito Boyz, but I love their food.

I ordered a chicken burrito on whole wheat pitta and added the works includ. guac. And the portions were huge! For such a cheap price! I was so used to chipotle pricing....btw its half here. 

Try it out!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting tonight and definantly not my last. I purchased the small soya veggie burrito, it was delish and certainly very filling. They are generous with the fresh  toppings and their customer service is friendly."}
{"text":"This is the go-to place for me whenever I need something good and cheap.  The burritos are always good.  Only thing is that it's always crazy busy during lunch time so I recommend pre-ordering before you go.  Otherwise you'll be waiting for a while.  5 out of 5 for taste and value."}
{"text":"My favorite place! I get the small naked chicken burrito with avocado. It's so much food it always lasts me two meals. Very friendly staff:)"}
{"text":"Loved its halibut burrito.  It's very tasty and filling.

Lineups are long though.  If you actually know what you are getting, it's better to call ahead and pre-order.  That will save you time."}
{"text":"Our favorite go-to for quesadilla and burrito cravings!

Food - quality and quantity
Mister and Missus have never been disappointed. Consistently met our expectation every single time we ordered our usual (steak quesadilla and naked halibut burrito). Ingredients always fresh and don't have to pay extra for the works/add-ons. 

Service - quick and pleasant
Staff are amazing and upbeat. Quick wait time even during rush hours.

OVERVIEW:
- Very spacious but can be very chilly indoor especially in the winter.
- Highly recommended over Bar Burrito and Fat Bastard.
- NEW! Extra $1.99 to get chips with salsa and a canned drink."}
{"text":"Okay, tried something different this time.   I actually had to go back two times because they mixed up my order.  One day I ordered a large shrimp burrito and they gave me steak accidentally.  I was already home so I didn't feel like returning it. I called them and they said sorry and offered me a free shrimp burrito next time.

Well, the steak was rely good and very well seasoned, much better than the haddock.

As for the shrimp, it was very good.  What I really liked about it (besides being free lol), was that used large prawn type shrimp as opposed to the small ones that other fast food establishments.  It was great value,"}
{"text":"It's a Burrito Boyz. Never bad when its 2am in the morning and you are feeling like a big burrito. Check in to yelp to get the free chips and salsa. They were nice about that!

It was pretty much only a take out restaurant for this location. No seating. 

Always say yes to guac."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it has been consistently good. They could use a bit more seasoning and the chicken can seems a bit dry when it's in the naked but this place is pretty cheap and the staff is always friendly. I think the naked is probably the best deal because you get so much."}
{"text":"Left extremely disappointed by Burrito Boyz despite the raving reviews. I upsized from a regular to a large Steak Naked Bowl coming up to $9 and change. My expectation was a very hearty meal, but was quite the opposite.

Presentation first off below average, my bowl looked messy and not put together very well. Biggest gripe I have is the portion size. From a place that claims to \"stuff their customers\" with hearty Mexican goodness, I received a container with the right side not even covered with any vegetables or chopped lettuce. Few bites in, I'm unearthing my meat, looking at the amount of rice and beans underneath in utter annoyance of the portion.

Even the beef was a letdown, tasted very dry with not a lot of flavour. Staring at my empty container and still hungry, very disappointing for $9. I've been to tons of places to eat and received double the amount of food for only $10 bill. I'm confident even I can make a much more filling Naked Bowl at home. Burrito Boyz was a one-timer for me, never again. Maybe Fat Bastard is worth a shot, have heard quite a few people say they are much better than their rivals across the street."}
{"text":"I like the idea of grilled burritos so that was a plus for me, but I realize not everyone likes that. The portion was good for the price, the chicken was tasty and the number of toppings available was great. Being able to add beans, corn, guacamole (at no additional cost), fresh jalapeños, cilantro and a number of other options to the burrito give you a nice unique burrito and then when you add the grill, it's a really tasty burrito."}
{"text":"What's going on esé?? I decided to get the chicken and steak naked burrito. The meat lacked the right seasonings and was very bland. The service was 'meh'. Staff could use a lesson on customer service. They were not the happiest bunch.This place should take a lesson from burrito bandidos (Grovesner) if they wanna make great burritos. I will give them credit for the calamari."}
{"text":"Big fan of BB, always have been since day one.

I am not happy with the lack of consistency from this location, I always visit it as it is closest one to my place however the flavor and quality of meat is lacking from time to time. Kind of defeats the purpose of franchising right?

Anyways, I will continue to visit and have my chicken burritos but I request that the flavor is on point!"}
{"text":"The burritos take a few minutes but the fact that they warm your toppings and toast your burrito after it is filled is great.  The hot sauce is very hot and the haddock is amazing in a burrito.  Love the quesadillas as well.  The secret sauce they use on their food is great, it favors but doesn't overpower!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp burrito which was yummy- solid option. Only 5 pieces of shrimp on the burrito though. Pretty standard burrito fare. a bit slow, friendly service, solid experience."}
{"text":"First time in Toronto, and we were looking for a restaurant that wasn't super busy with good, inexpensive food. We walked around, then found this place. There was a bit of a line, but they processed the orders quickly, and we got two burritos served up within ten minutes. The small burrito was more than enough, and as big as the large. Will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"The first thing that I noticed when I walked in was how clean this place is. The burritos are delicious, good food quickly? Friendly service and well organized!
There is definitely no lack of topping selections for whatever burrito you decide to have. I tried a half chicken half steak burrito (not on the menu) but I think they'll make you anything you'd like. My next try will be a Haddock burrito... I wonder if that's going to be similar to a fish taco? Stay tuned...
The owner (I think) was sweeping up outside ensuring the exterior was clean and free of cigarette butts. A rare thing to see these days.
I was left with the impression of 'clean and friendly service'. Will definitely be back and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Not the best Burito i have ever had, but damn tasty and for 7$ you eat like a king..all the fixings and a young hip staff, certainly the spot after a club......"}
{"text":"The ingredients taste fresh, but service is an absolute nightmare!  Fat Bastard (across the street) has Burrito Boyz beat for flavour in all but the refried beans.  The manager seems to be the worst, not knowing how to interact with either staff or customers.  Staff range from great to.... very not great."}
{"text":"I think I've been spoiled by eating delicious quesadillas quite frequently because the chicken quesadilla I ate was sub par.  It was greasy and the quality of chicken was not impressive. I gave an extra star because you can choose the fillings and those were fresh."}
{"text":"I been to this location many times usually get good service but yesterday not so good after leaving nearly a $5 dollar tip on a $21 dollar order the young lady said there would be an extra charge for more cheese when clearly she didn't put quite enough before I asked her for more. Young people just don't get it they expect a gratuity but nothing in return. I'm not saying I won't go back there just no more tips..."}
{"text":"Amazing burrito. After walking around downtown at 11:30pm on a Saturday night with very little luck finding an open restaurant, we stumbled upon Burrito Boyz (open until 4am I believe). Unfortunately, walking down the street was difficult as we had to fight through the crowds of club-goers. For $21 total, we got two drinks, two orders of chips & guacamole, and two burritos (steak and chicken). Only complaint is the ratio of guac to chips. Taking modest scoops, I finished my guacamole not even halfway into my order of chips. Translation: This is the place to go if you take very small bites of guacamole. Despite that, the guacamole was very good, the burrito was better. I got everything on my burrito (they have a pretty good sized topping list) and the tortilla held strong. Doing the same at Chipotle, I would probably get one bite in before the tortilla fell apart. This place is great."}
{"text":"I think Burrito Boyz is one of the best Tex-Mex/burrito chains.  All their ingredients are fresh.  At this location, the service is fast and friendly too.  

So why only the 3 stars?  This is mostly a takeout joint as they only have a few bar stools (and very cramped at that), but in the summer, they put out a few picnic tables outside for more seating.  

Verdict: Great for a quick filling meal on the go."}
{"text":"Hello folks after a night out at the Royal, decided to check this place out!!  For burritos, I've had far better and far worse...  This place is just so so...  But I was so torn!!!  Heard so much about this place and it came highly recommended!


The Good:

- Cool space, half open patio is kinda cool looking over busy College St. in Little Italy

- Uber friendly staff!

- The fact you can choose between small and large, sometimes a large burrito is just too large!! Large burrito is a size of a baby :D


The Meh~:

- You'd expect a wicked burrito from a place named \"Burrito Boyz,\" too much build up, not enough cheddar, if ya know what I mean...

- My chicken burrito felt like it had ground chicken?!? Why?  Isn't it supposed to be chicken cutlets?  It's not my first time eating a burrito good sir! 

- No A/C inside, I was boiling in therr.  It's the beginning of the summer so it's fine, but later on phew~~~ I don't know guy...


It would have been 2 stars but the staff were so darn friendly!! Maybe next time I'll try the steak?

Bob out from Little Italy!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Lots of food. Prepared fresh and made to order. It's amazing how quickly they make them. Very tasty. I got the Mahi and one chicken...both were excellent. One of my favorite burritos ever"}
{"text":"The Etobicoke Burrito Boyz on the Queensway is my favourite location because it is the largest I have been to with an actual area with tables and chairs to sit down.  Now, I love Burrito boys, I think it is superior to Fat bastards, which also happens to be across the street. The other nice thing is their is free parking, but it could be a bigger lot.  If you like it spicy, be sure to ask for Lines of their hot sauce, not those weak dots I see some people get. My goto is a Steak and Shrimp mix, with two lines of hot sauce, and loaded up with tons of veggies.  Otherwise this location is clean, service is fast, and the bathrooms are clean and we'll maintained."}
{"text":"They are open late night at Hwy10+Dundas location, always fresh, always filling, made just the way you want- and the people that work there are always entertaining! YUMMY"}
{"text":"This place is the definition of pretty good for me. 

The burritos are pretty delicious but also pretty expensive. The place is scuzzy as hell and no matter when I go, I always feel rushed. It's a genuinely terrible atmosphere in almost every way and yet the staff is consistently nice. 

Also, they're one of those places that charges exorbitant amounts for extra guacamole and then gives you barely any extra guacamole (I will never understand the restaurant industry's treatment of guacamole as spreadable gold)

All in all, it's surely the best place to get a burrito in Brampton but I'm not sure that says THAT much."}
{"text":"Sometimes, I have to actively tell myself to keep driving when I pass by Burrito Boyz since it's gluttonous to have one everyday. 

A friend of mine introduced me to Burrito Boyz on Queensway years ago and I got a chicken burrito. I thought it was simply good but nothing to write home about. 
But then I went to the Roncesvalles location one day and they accidentally made me the wrong mix- steak and shrimp. 
This was the best mistake ever; as it turns out, this combination tastes way better to me than what I ordered and am very grateful for the happy accident. 

Since then, I have downloaded their app to conveniently pre-order my selection and skip the line. I also ordered a burrito for my brother once and he now goes there often too. 

I'm a creature of habit and stick with the same combination, but there are so many options to try. If you're not in love with what you ordered, try a new option/mix.  

Great atmosphere, exceptional customer service, and always busy. Key signs of a successful business."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz is not, despite claims I've heard to the contrary, particularly authentic Mexican food, but it is awfully tasty and seeing them branch out into the burbs is really great news.

Long a staple of Toronto's club district, Burrito Boyz (and now, since the owners parted ways, Burrito Banditoz) locations offer a very simple menu of takeout burritos that are flavourful and filling. The beef is the obvious choice but, while it is delicious, I recommend exploring the pulled pork they recently added to their menu or, if you're willing to trust me and give it a try, the Halibut. If meat is not your cup of... meat, the bean & cheese is a stalwart and capable companion.

By and large you won't go wrong putting everything on it - their salsa has some heat, but not a ton, and their veg is consistent and fresh. The only thing I might hold back on is the burrito sauce, a runny mess that adds flavour, but also slop.

Veterans of the Toronto locations will remember the chaos of the ordering process - go here, tell them what you want, they give you a number, stand in another line, remember your number, tell that guy what you ordered as well, get a card, &c. Charming though it is, franchising seems to have brought some rationality to the process. The Brampton location takes your order once, gives you a numbered receipt, and has ample waiting room while your burrito is prepped and thrown on the griddle.

Not the best burrito I've ever had, but almost certainly the best takeout burrito in Brampton, really consistent, and bonus points for setting up shop a block east of the Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I had to come here after all the years of coming out here and seeing all the raves from Zagat, Now, Eye, etc. and all this? For a burrito joint? After all, I'm in LA with Mexican, Cal-Mex, Tex-Mex and Plasti-Mex (Taco Bell, Del Taco, etc.) on every block next to some sushi bar. So how good can a Toronto burrito be?

Turns out pretty darned good.

Places mainly does Burritos, Enchiladas, and little else. Drinks are all cans of Coke, Juvex or bottles of Snapple. No booze so no Corona's or Sol's. You place your order and then you go to a counter and select from a variety of fillings and it's all placed on a huge (white or wheat) tortilla. At this point, I'm thinking I'm at a Chipotle and I'm worried since this is somewhat the same setup. Here's the difference. At this point at Chipotle, they basically serve you your burrito and you're done and it sucks. At the Boyz, they cook your meats freshly prepared on site and then grill your burrito so it comes out really hot. So you wait 10-15 minute but the result is a huge improvement. I dared moving away from the Steak or Chicken burritos and tried the Halibut one instead. I figure if you can have fish tacos ala Wahoo's or Rubio's, why not fish burritos? It was a good call with tender flaky fish and a lot of fillings. Seating is really limited so I'm glad I was able to grab a table. My minuses about the place are no salsa bar, no refills on drinks and no booze. Also, Pork Carnitas would've been a nice touch. Still, this is TO so I'll take it in stride. There aren't a lot of Mexican places here and the addition of Chipotle isn't improving it. At least there's no El Torito but there is this great spot in downtown that's the stuff of legend."}
{"text":"not sure why, but my family is addicted to these burritos, i have not been a fan of Mexican food, but i have to day this is good stuff, tried the steak and shrimp combo, really good!"}
{"text":"Why must all burritos in Toronto be so sub-par?  Why must they insist on grilling burritos rather than using hot ingredients, like real Mexican places in NY and LA?  And why, why must they mix canned veggies into the rice?  I'm sorry, I just don't like peas in my burrito... is that too much to ask?

The veggie burrito was pretty much bland, and burritos that I get out here are usually very flavorful - even if they're mild.  And the grilling gives it a texture that's just wrong.  Although I don't think Chipotle's great - and don't patronize them in the States - maybe Burrito Boyz would be better if they were inspired by this chain.  Toronto - you need to start getting some better burritos!"}
{"text":"Good burrito,  not great.  Reviews are over rated,  the place is great for midnight after club food but I wouldn't go here if I want a GREAT burrito.  It's a nice quick fix.  They don't have much meat options (ex flavoured chickens or flavoured meats)  

I would come back if I was craving burrito specifically,  but wouldn't be first choice burrito place either."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz is a terrific place for a great, fast lunch or dinner! Their burritos are delicious and fresh and the staff members are welcoming and create your tailor made burrito while you wait. The small burrito is more than enough for a meal for me! Love the fact that it is easy to have a great veggie burrito here that is simple and delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Burrito Boyz. I'd gone around with my partner at around 5pm (so not peak time). The person who made our burrito was in so much hurry and she didn't care whether we followed the ingredients that she was putting. 
I've had burritos from other places and this one was the worst. The chicken was overcooked, she barely put any sauces & condiments and the end result was a bland tasting burrito.
I won't come here again."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, servings are huge, and the prices aren't terrible. This is my kind of lunch place. It's always waaayyy too busy in here but the staff keep the line moving at a good pace so although it's awkward not knowing where to stand in the crowd while waiting at least you know food is less than five minutes away.

They didn't screw up my order once, even when I ordered for multiple people. They didn't complain or give me the eye when I placed my friend's VERY particular order (I mean I even gave her the eye when she asked me to go order that for her). 

As I said, portions are huge. Love that they have cilantro and corn. Extra burrito sauce is essential. I'm all about the chicken. I don't eat cooked fish but 90% of people I see in the restaurant order the fish burritos so you should probably try that too."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I came at a bad time but the staff weren't friendly at all. I told the lady who was making my bowl that I didn't want any hot sauce or anything that was spicy. However, she proceeded to add hot sauce and after reminding her, she then added jalapeños. When I got my food, the halibut was rock hard and tasted like cardboard. It was my first time coming to this location and needless to say it will be my last. There's a Chipotle right around the corner that has better service and way better quality."}
{"text":"A calamari burrito??? Yes they can do that.  Food is very good, service is quick and painless.
A solid burrito spot"}
{"text":"- came around 10 pm Saturday night(quiet time )
-I'm a loyal Burrito Boys customer (not this location) 
Ordered a chicken naked
-short haired girl barks my number when my order is ready (didn't even reply with a you're welcome ?)
Ok that was fine but then 
Chicken was literally cold (all 3 friends had that problem )
Guacamole was grey

Overall disappointing location.
Food: 2/5
Service: 1/5"}
{"text":"I'm a loyal Burrito Boyz customer

Came in tonight got my quesadilla and my buddy got a burrito. The quesadilla was whole wheat instead of white, which is fine. But it was so over cooked and chewy that it was inedible ( never had a problem out of the 25+ queso's I've had)"}
{"text":"[I've updated this listed to reflect my new 3.5 star rating.  The last few times I've been there the food was awful.  I think they were going through some staff changes.  I have also heard the quality has gone down in recent months from others (Dec 11/08)]

This place is a staple for those in the clubbing district.  Burritos are grilled (which makes them so much tastier) and are big as a football, heavy as a brick.  

Though I am a meat eater, I find these burritos to contain too much meat (unless you get the halibut).  A better option is the large bean and cheese, which isn't as heavy and gross as the steak or chicken ones.  Halibut is best of the bunch, but its like a $10 burrito.  Get a small if you are not a big eater.  Watch out for the hot sauce, it is very hot.

Perfect spot for the morning after or after the \"night of\" festivities.  Also, be prepared to wait in a cramped environment for up to 15 minutes or so.

{"text":"I love this place. I came to Toronto for vacation and I love mexican food so i decided to try this and it was definitely worth the trip. I ordered a large Steak burrito and you can add whichever toppings you want for one price (except if you get the guac - its an extra 87 cents). It definitely fills you up for this ridiculous low price. You are getting a lot of food for your money comparable to most other restaurants in the city. Well worth it and delicious. When we went there, the place was so crowded. The wait was a good 20 mins to get your food but we did go there around lunchtime on a Monday so everyone who was on break from the busy city was there it seemed like."}
{"text":"It's no Burrito Bandidos but goddamn these are way better than Chipotle. This place is my go to cause it's local to me. I can finally tolerate 5 lines of their hot sauce and it turned me to a spiceonaut and want to search for the hottest sauces possible now. Wish my anus good luck."}
{"text":"In the tradition of their other locations, the Etobicoke Burrito Boyz is quite delicious.  Not much I can say about this place that hasn't already been said, so I'll keep it short and sweet.  The food is outstanding, and the service is friendly.  The place was quite busy so it took a little while to get my order.  If anything, the menu has too few options (just burritos and quesadillas), and there really isn't anywhere to sit to eat your meal.  Otherwise, I would have to give this a perfect score.  I'm still loyal to Chorizo's in Mississauga, but I have no problem coming here once in a while as it is apples to Chorizo's oranges.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite BBoyz location. I used to go to the other Scarborough location but the service at Kennedy is so much better. I'm even on a first name basis with the night crew - Emma, Jenny, Troy, and Justin. They always know my order and get it started as soon as I get in the door. I also appreciate being greeted when I come in and being thanked as I leave. 

As for the food, it's always fresh and the counter with the toppings is always well kept and stocked. The price paid for the portion of food is a bargain so you really
can't go wrong. I highly recommend the shrimp burritos

Thanks for the great service and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Rude staff, great food, big location with lots of seating. Not much to say as I've been to multiple bboyz locations but this one has the worst customer service."}
{"text":"Great location! Staff were friendly and the food is always great at Burrito Boyz. Definitely the smallest location I've ever been to with no seating at all, so that's something to keep in mind for those wanting to dine in somewhere. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the shrimp and sweet potato mix burrito I got. 

TIP: When I checked in on yelp, I got a free bag of chips and salsa! First time I've seen this at Burrito Boyz--free food is always a welcomed surprise in my books."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  Amazing food, and amazing service.  Theres long lines here late at night but its worth it.  Whether you are drunk, sober, high, cracked up, or Rob Ford level, this food hits the spot.  You don't even have to be a latina to enjoy the big burritos these boyz offer."}
{"text":"Love this place!

The first burrito boyz I went to was the one downtown. But when they opened one closer to home the excitement rushed through me like a little kid in a candy store.

You can pick and choose what goes in and what def stays out. The lady's here understand portion and when I say a little more...lets just say sometimes I shouldn't even ask for a little more! LOL and like what everyone here says the grilling is the KEY to its out come. 

Prices are reasonable and affordable. They greet you with a happy smile and send you on your way. That is if you can get a seat! or even make it in the front door because parking sometimes is a pain. 

I recently found if you park behind the mini plaza, behind the houses there is a huge parking spot. I don't recommend parking right across where they are building a condo or whatever that is..you'll get a ticket. I haven't got one but those yellow things across the street are not so nice to see!  

btw their SIZE small and large...im not sure...but small to me looks like large an large to me looks like ridiculously large o_O if your just feeling hungry consider sharing but then again all that goodness.. never-mind get one for yourself!"}
{"text":"***recently been here again, and i'm disappointed to see that they charge extra for guac. When i'm paying over $12 for a burrito, i think a bit of guac should be part of it***"}
{"text":"I come here every trip to Toronto for work. So fresh and made to order. The portion size is huge and I have yet to finish a small burrito myself. Plus side leftover burrito for breakfast still tasty. The service is quick and the staff is friendly. Small burrito with a can of pop was $12. Only note the spicy sauce is really spicy!!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is busy everyday. There's not much parking in front but if you don't mind walking there's more down the side road next to the parkade. 

It's a fast food Mexican burrito place where you can get a variety of burritos and quesadillas. My favourite is the halibut burrito. Always made fresh and why it'll take about 15 minutes from ordering to eating. There's a wide range of toppings for your burrito......You can have it as a wrap or a open face salad. Full warning the spicy sauce is pretty spicy. 

The staff really friendly and the price is pretty cheap for the size. Definitely one of my go to places when looking for a quick but delicious bit to eat."}
{"text":"Ahhh...this is where I had my first burrito and my life has been forever changed. Love at first bite! This is my favourite burrito chain (much better than chipotle) just because of how flavourful all the ingredients are! There are options for vegans, vegetarians, and meat-lovers, and they're quite generous with the FREE guac. You can even mix up the main meats or veggies if you want (ex. steak & chicken, sweet potato & haddock). I always get either a small ($7.50) or large ($9) chicken burrito with extra burrito sauce. The small is more than enough to fill me up!

The wait time for them to make your burrito is about 5 to 10 minutes, but you can always call and order in advance. There's only street parking available unless you want to risk it and park in the private lot in the nearby plaza. There's only about 6 or 7 tables inside, but most people take their food to-go anyways."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this entire chain, and I was ecstatic when this place opened up almost 2 years ago. Burritos are consistent at each location, the only difference is in service. Luckily, almost all the food apps (grabb, ritual, etc) include this location so I am able to order in advance. The last time I ordered on my app, it took about 20 minutes for my burrito to be ready - I guess this location gets super busy. This is a TINY location. There is nowhere to sit and I often have to wait outside because there's barely any standing room. 

As I said in my review of the Willowdale location, this is my favourite burrito chain (much better than chipotle) just because of how flavourful all the ingredients are! There are options for vegans, vegetarians, and meat-lovers, and they're quite generous with the FREE guac. You can even mix up the main meats or veggies if you want (ex. steak & chicken, sweet potato & haddock). I always get either a small ($7.50) or large ($9) chicken burrito with extra burrito sauce. The small is more than enough to fill me up!"}
{"text":"First time having burrito boyz. The combo was very filling and the place had a Very nice atmosphere. the employees are kind as well"}
{"text":"In town for work and I was looking for a lunch spot. Had a chicken burrito bowl with everything.  Tasted great and order was done quickly.  

I would come back again and will around lunch time in the future."}
{"text":"Definitely a place for late night dinner. I went there around 10pm on a weekday and its not crowded at all. My husband and i rarely eat Mexican food so we are not sure how to order it but the server was patience enough to serve us. The haddock burrito that I had was fresh but lack of seasoning for the fish. I wish there's more seasoning. My husband had the steak and it was really delicious and flavorful! Please note that even the small burrito is really big!"}
{"text":"If you find yourself hungry late night in Toronto and looking to satisfy your appetite with some Tex-Mex, Burrito Boyz has got you covered! Minus one star for the surly attitude from some of the employees."}
{"text":"This review is only based on my recent order of chicken and shrimp naked burrito. And it may only be like $.50 difference as I paid for a the cost of a shrimp baked burrito I would never recommend this split burrito. Basically check out the photo and you will see I was given ONLY 3 pieces of shrimps. In actual they forgot to add the shrimp so I came back and the cook poured the shrimp on and I noticed one piece he basically said \"oh well, 3 is enough\". Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken borrito on whole wheat.  

The place was fairly busy, but orders were processed quickly.  Mine came out about 5 minutes as promised and I had the choice in toppings.  Many to choose from.  Basic beans and rice and then lettuce, onion, cilantro, black beans, jalapeno peppers, green peppers, etc.  Let's just say there is more than I could name.  

Tasted delicious and was wrapped properly so as jot to leak and fall out all over the place.  

Second time visoting this location and I'd say that it consistant with quality and taste.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"Went for some late night burritos as I was visiting a family member at the hospital and couldn't be bothered to cook. 

We ordered 2 burritos; one halibut and one chicken. Now, we like our hot sauce and couldn't stress that enough.  The girl was finished making mine before making my boyfriend's and had run out of hot sauce at that point.  

She continued to make his burrito and have it ready for the proteins to be added and had left for a moment to grab more hot sauce from a cooler.  We had stood there watching the whole thing as she had forgotten to put it for his burrito and then passed it off to the fry cook.  

I had tried to advise him and he couldn't care less to listen and when she had finish refilling and placing products back in the display the burrito had already been packaged. 

I had asked if they had put the hot sauce  (which I clearly saw they didn't!) To only get a rude snarky reply that yes they already did. 

Haha ok so we had to ask for it on the side and glad we did because it wasn't there!  

Crap attitude from incompetent people making the same thing day in and day out how hard is it to show a little customer service?"}
{"text":"We go here once and awhile, whenever our bboyz cravings come around. This location is the newest in Scarborough, their prices are the same as the other locations, the only difference is the space. They have a smaller restaurant in the plaza and there is very limited seating. And sadly....no washroom. So if you gotta go, well you're poop outta luck. Overall, the convenience is here and it's easy to find something to eat here. Staff are nice and food is standard with the other locations we've tried."}
{"text":"This place has been around for awhile however I never had a craving for burrito-ish kind of food...but I thought it would be a good alternative since we have tried pretty much everything else in the area. We first went to another burrito place nearby but after seeing the lack of seating/small place we yelp'd reviews for Burrito Boyz to see what this location was like. We ended up coming here instead for the main reason of more spacious seating. This location has a lot of offerings for meat and non-meat eaters which is great for large groups. No need to worry about anyone getting left out! On my first visit I ordered the steak naked burrito however it was a bit dry due to lack of sauce (my decision). Nachos and water for an extra $2. I have been back here since then, and I have decided that I prefer the panfried fish + shrimp naked burrito. Probably one of my new favourite spots to eat now. Plus the bit of guac is included but if you want more...we'll you know the famous line. \"Guac is extra!\". Ya ya I know guac is always extra. 

The only negative would be the staff can seem a bit stand offish. The music at the front is a bit loud so when you tell them what you want you'll have to SHOUT. Even then they might not hear you, they can give you a bit of attitude for requesting extra veggies too."}
{"text":"Based on my first visit here, I prefer this location more then the Scarborough one.
I like the fact that they don't have music blasting so loud that they can't hear what you want on your food. The staff were very nice and were very careful with what ingredients I wanted, they listened and didn't give any attitude if you asked for more onions (jeez it's sooo hard to just put some more) sometimes you may experience at the other location. At the other location, I've experienced times when they just throw on ingredients before you have a chance to answer and then they give you attitude when you correct them. Food was good as usual, BF got the steak as usual and I got the mixed pan fried halibut+shrimp. Because the staff were good listeners and nice they get my favouritism!"}
{"text":"Took awhile for someone to come to the register to take our order - we waited a couple of minutes standing there. After that the food came pretty quickly, but when asking for extra scoop of corn, the girl just took a minuscule grab. @ Chipotle the quantities are more generous I feel. Overall food is good and the experience was mediocre."}
{"text":"I went down the steep steps into the dungeon, ordered a beef burrito with everything on it. They gave me a number, I waited, and waited......and waited. I got my Burrito, it was big. I understand what took it so long to make. The poor shell was ready to burst - it looked like me trying to fit back into my size 31 jeans from 10 years ago! 
Needless to say, it was great. The price was good. The wait was long, I couldn't actually tell you what was in the burrito as it was made in the cramped kitchen while I waited outside. The point really is that its a great burrito, good price, and that's about all your going to get - so enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favourite burrito place in Mississauga. Trust me, the location matters. I have been to other locations, but this one makes the best burritos by far. The service level is great. They are super busy all the time, but they never fall short on service. My favourite burrito is the Chicken burrituo loaded with everything. When I say loaded, I mean loaded. They pack up the burrito so much that every bite you take give you the taste of all the ingredients. Highly recommended place!"}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz is never disappointing!

I ordered the Halibut burrito (medium) because I'm kind of a light weight and it did not disappoint.

I went around 12:30 to 1:00 pm and it was quit busy. The quality of the food was great, it was hot  and I even managed to find a seat.....somehow.

Because it was busy, it did take awhile to get served and to get my order but I understand.

I recommend this location any day!"}
{"text":"Yes a new option for take out in Willowdale, thank goodness!!

5 stars might be too over the top for a simple Burrito place, but they've been great every time I've ordered which is about once a week since they've opened.

I typically call in and pick up, super easy and they take credit card with the tap technology, so I'm in and out super quick avoid a parking ticket and back home, noming watching Game of Thrones. 

Burrito ingredients always taste super fresh and I like how they \"toast\" the burrito wrap."}
{"text":"One of favorite places to eat on the King W side, simple and relatively quick. 

I typically always get the chicken burrito and the small is enough for me for dinner.

Ingredients are always fresh and watch out for the hot sauce cause it's skull scratching hot. 

Seating is limited so be prepared to take your burrito outside or you can even eat at Metro Hall Park."}
{"text":"Kind of quick - but not ideal. I definitely feel like chipotle is better in this regard. I got a bowl and despite seeing that the meat was being prepared separately I went home to a cold meal."}
{"text":"If happiness was a food, you would not find it at Burrito Boyz. Why? Because that would be an insulting understatement. What they do serve (though my words will not do it justice) is heavenly bliss wrapped in immeasurable excellence, that upon ingestion, kills you (no mortal can handle it) and immediately resurrects you. That's simply because the amount of energy stored in this magnificent creature (more of a beast actually) can jump start an entire planet"}
{"text":"The Port Credit location is small. It's the size of a small barber shop, but it's filled with the aroma of delicious meats and embellishment for a burrito lover. The portion of the burritos are magnificent, when you finally get to hold the thing, it's like holding a baby. Not exactly the best analogy but you catch my drift. 

The food's worth every penny, come reach if you're around Lakeshore. And bring cash, it'll be needed. Cheers!"}
{"text":"It's late. I'm hungry. I've already spent too much money during the night. This sounds like the time to go to Burrito Boyz and spend the best $8 I'll spend all night on a large chicken burrito.

I don't know what it is that makes these things so good... Is it their special burrito sauce? is it the tasty filling? Who cares, as all you need to know is this is the best late night snack in Little Italy, and one of the best things you'll find for under $10 in the area regardless of the time."}
{"text":"I don't even like Mexican food and this place was AWESOME! I just got out of the ballet (Nutcracker) and was itching for food so I busted out my iPhone and launched Yelp...minutes later I was having a chicken and beef burrito with the works....God is life good.

This place has lots of choices for burritos and its cheap as can be. I love it. Oh yeah, it was $8 dollars with tax and I was stuffed!"}
{"text":"After hearing all the rave reviews from different colleagues, I decided to finally try this place out for myself for lunch on Friday.

The line-up was short, service was quick (4-5 minutes), receipt with order number (well organized) and super generous portions.

I had the naked burrito bowl with halibut and sweet potato. I usually can down a Chipotle bowl no problem, but I was able to save the other half for dinner! That's how generous the portions are. Extra guac for 90 cents.

I will most likely return on Mondays for their special."}
{"text":"For a place named Burrito Boyz, I was quite surprised that everyone working there was a female.

Anyhoo,

Lemme give you the shimmy. 

Came here on a friday night, around 2.30am. GOt myself a small steak burrito. Everything on it. No need to fuss. It was 2.30am. Got home around 3.45am. It was then that I finally had the chance to nom it. 

O.
M.
F.
G.

WHAT ARE YOU? 

This was hands down the best burrtio of my life. SO many magical flavours. So much meat. SO much cheese. 

DROOL. 

Woke up with bits of burrito all over my face.



THEN

I went back. Sunday Night.

2am again.

GOT A MIX.

Chicken + Shrimp. Extra Jalaps. 8 dollars. Large.

This is a lie right? HOW CAN IT BE SO CHEAP?!?!

THE SHRIMP WERE LARGE AND IN CHARGE.

THE CHICKEN for DE.LI.CIOUS.

Mouth = on fire.

I want to go back every day. Every year. Every forever.


LOVE YOU BURRITO BOYS.

Can I marry one of you? 

Also, I shuld add like 6 extra stars for a 90's Backstreet Boys dance-down that happened with my friends + the ..burrito girls?"}
{"text":"I think I prefer Chipotle; the food was fine but it took too long and the taste was meh.  Chipotle is much quicker. 

Food: 2/5, I got the steak burrito with all the toppings and it was ok - just didn't taste much like anything other than a bunch of stuff together.

Service: 1/5, it took over 15 minutes to my get food and I was the 3rd in line. 

Ambience: 2/5, it was just ok

Price: 2/5, About $13-15 per person - not so sure..."}
{"text":"Love the burritos here! Toppings are fresh, tortilla is toasty.  One of the best burrito places. Only issue is this place gets so packed at 12pm that it is difficult to find seating"}
{"text":"About time burrito boyz comes up to north york. I've been visiting the downtown location forever and I'm so excited now i can walk down the street and get my spicy hali in 10 min. 

Service and food both pretty much the same as the downtown place - love it!"}
{"text":"I love burrito boyz! i love ALL the buririto boyz shops! large hali everything, everytime!"}
{"text":"soooo good if you're super hungry and can finish the whole thing. 

hali burrito, everything, spicy. nuff said."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and quick service.  Seating area is good for small groups.  Since they grill the fajita, that makes this my preferred fast food burrito spot. I get the halibut and ask for lime."}
{"text":"It was my second time trying Burrito Boyz, though my first time at this location. I remember trying it a few years ago and being wowed by the flavours - way more than places like Chipotle or Tejanos BBQ (Montreal). Thankfully, this location did not disappoint.

We ordered 1 burrito each so 3 in total. 1 steak, 1 chicken and 1 fish (haddock). We got large burritos when I found out that the large part isn't the tortilla but rather the portion of protein in the burrito. For $33 total, we were all happy and very satisfied with our respective burrito! 

What I love is the ability to personalize the burrito (whole wheat tortilla, guac - duh - and a variety of chopped vegetables and sauces and beans/rice for those who like that kinda thing). My fave part is at the end when they've made the burrito, they first grill your choice of protein on the grill, then once it's assembled, they toast it which is such a simple but key part of what makes this burrito so great.

I don't think I would get a large if I were to go back because that was too much meat for me but otherwise delicious and will be going back when in the area! One thing to note: there is no seating area so you have to get takeout."}
{"text":"The food is always super good and I've never had an issue with this location until the last visit. Not only did I find out they started charging for guac last month but the portion of guac that they give you is super small for the fact they are now charging. I ordered a naked haddock and if I didn't ask for more of every single topping I'd be left with a bunch of lettuce and 6 kernals of corn, 5 black beans and 4 diced cubes of tomatoes. I wish I was exaggerating. Each time I asked for a little bit more of something the girl serving me looked annoyed and like i was taking food from her house or something. Holy crap. Not a fan of skimping on toppings. The food is pricey so I don't understand why you're rationing and hoarding tomatoes and beans. I hope it was just a one off and this isn't indicative of what burrito boyz is all about now. I'll give it another shot but if that girl is working again I'm sure my experience will be the same."}
{"text":"Love the flavour, love the prices, love the portions. We ordered a steak beef bowl. Jam packed with flavour and toppings, it was really yummy - corn, beans, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream... When you get the spiciest sauce for your side (or you can get it put straight into your dish), it really is spicy - added a good kick to the overall flavour! For price and portions, this place serves you well. A great alternative to Chipotle.  Service was pretty quick too and friendly! I'd definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've visited so I wanted to try out their naked burritos. Didn't disappoint, just the right amount of filling to leave you satisfied.

I suggest trying any of their naked burritos. You can save a few dollars by getting their daily specials. Great place if you need late-night food. Plus you can order ahead of time to avoid wait times."}
{"text":"Super tasty. For a random ass burrito joint this place is amazing. Halibut large burrito. Not crazy big, but big. Love the rice in there. Free guac. Heaven."}
{"text":"The food is fresh but IMO bland. I almost am tempted to give it two stars partially because there were so many good reviews. If you want to eat a bit more healthy I recommend it but i woudlnt have gone out of my way. I just found it quite bland. For 11.50 I got a large chicken burrito and I'm still somewhat hungry. Stick with the bowl which is more reasonably priced. I don't think other reviewers here have had a really good burrito."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout with a group of people from work. I got the chicken quesadilla with salsa and burrito sauce (sooooo good). I was surprised at how big the portions were, and it tastes fantastic. Will definitely order again"}
{"text":"Good burritos at a fair value is how I would describe Burrito Boyz. 

I went with the large steak burrito with all the toppings. The burrito toppings were definitely fresh and tasty. There was veggies, rice, corn, beans, cheese and even guacamole (huge plus for including guacamole at no extra cost).  Burrito boyz is a really good value and to be able to get a large burrito for around $10 with tax is pretty awesome. The large burrito is definitely more than enough to satisfy your hunger.

I was severely disappointed with the 'steak' itself which was like ground beef (sirloin cut probably). I expected steak strips but with the price I paid I guess I should not have. The beef was pretty flavourless too. I also felt like the toppings could have been spread out more evenly, as the end I started with being considerably better than the side I ended with (all that guacamole and cheesy goodness was at the top). I also would have liked to see carnitas or even pork as a protein option.

Service was a tad slower than I would have liked for 'fast food'. It took them a while to the burrito when it wasn't busy at all.

I'll definitely be back as I was pretty disappointed overall with the 'steak', and I'm almost certain the other proteins are guaranteed to be better."}
{"text":"Many imitators but no duplicators. In  my opinion the best burrito place in Toronto. Try the Halibut burrito, its off the hook."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I have visited a couple of times with my mom (she is a big fan of this place) and have overall enjoyed the food. I once had take out and most recently stayed in to eat. For those wondering, the style of cuisine here is more Tex Mex than authentic Mexican but still tasty!

This location is super busy but the line moves fast. You walk up to the cashier, place your order, pay, and then are called up by order number in a little while. They ask what toppings you want on your meal item. All of the toppings are laid out nicely in front of you and you can see what is going on your food. Everything looked/tasted super fresh.

Nice to see they have a few veggie options. I opted for a veggie burrito the last time I was there and really enjoyed it. Note, those who aren't big eaters, I would for sure recommend getting the small size of whatever you order unless you want leftovers - their portions are huge!

Will return again soon!"}
{"text":"Probably came here once a week in the summer as it was a short walk from my office. I think burrito boyz is well priced, tasty joint for a quick bite. I find each location to be consistent with the taste and service. I'm a huge fan of the chain and continue to promote my friends to try it out. 

My two favourites are the sweet potato and fried haddock, can't go wrong with both!"}
{"text":"Oh so goooood! Very filling and affordable! Great portion but very short tempered staff. Newcomers be advised you won't be given time to chose your toppings. 
Lots of yelling from the staff in the kitchen area and always very busy... 

With that being said I still come back about once a month because dis I forget to mention the burritos ohhhhhh so good!"}
{"text":"I'll break down in pieces. For the food, this place gets four stars, as it was a generous portion, and quite tasty.

The service was okay, considering their computer was down and they seemed flummoxed by the lack of a system. The location was fine, but there was nothing to write home about. Three stars.

Being an American and scary bad at exchange math, I don't know if it represents great value for money. I'm inclined to think so, and that's an important consideration with this kind of food. Because of my inability to do maths, 3.5 stars, making this a 3.5 overall.

As for the food, my wife and a small steak burrito bowl and I had a small chicken burrito bowl. Both were tasty and filling, but the thing that perplexed us was the lack of pork on the menu? No carnitas? Huh?"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a tasty and cheap bite near Queen street. Ask for extra guac and go when it's not too busy."}
{"text":"Late night food could not be better then this - its just amazingly delicious and all my friends love it too!"}
{"text":"best burritos in toronto, probably, but that's not saying too much. long waits around lunchtime. they change around the line system all the time which is very confusing, but it's all totally worth it.

not great quality, but try not to think about it and chances are you wont get sick. it's the kind of place you crave at 2am on a cold saturday night-- and for that, they get my vote."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday. The place wasn't busy at all and the girl making the food had the biggest problem with serving us. Every time we asked for something she rolled her eyes and just generally looked annoyed to be serving us. But the girl who took our order was very pleasant. Probably won't be going back to this location again."}
{"text":"So I once went to see Brent Spiner, the guy who played Data on Star Trek, talk at a convention (i'm cool) and he opened his little talk by telling us all about how the night before, he'd had a truly unique dining experience.  He went to Burrito Boyz.  His only regret?  Not getting a large.

He's pretty much bang on.  There's very little to regret when it comes to Burrito Boyz.  Their burritos are big and filled to the point of bursting with delicious flavours.  I usually go for the small, because the large really is very large, but I'll indulge once in a while.

They've got a variety of meats you can choose from.  Some favourite being chicken, halibut and beef.

Everything is great really.  Even their level of spice, is always bang on for me.  You can request that they withhold certain things like hot sauce or jalopenos, but trust me, it's not that bad."}
{"text":"Large steak and chicken burrito that is filled with goodness. Couldn't give a higher rating as there a bitter taste from the burned pieces of meat."}
{"text":"Giving 3 stars as I am not sure how it is now that it is a chain.

Back in the day there was the original Burrito Boyz on Peter and then they opened up this one on Adelaide (Burrito's of the gourmet calibre were hard to get in those days).

a) busy packed but has a number system for swift order turn-over (see e)
b) great food for tourists / locals (open late and during lunch hours and after office hours - so a good all round place to pick up a Gourmet Burrito)
c) this place has seats (no parking though)
d) Large burritos's - you could split one for 2 people depending on the \"hunger\" factor
e) Take your number order your burrito and wait your turn for the finished product
f) not sure how it is now that it is a chain - but the guac is great (costs a bit extra but worth it), the burritos are HUGE, you can choose as much toppings as you desire, fresh made and NOT frozen.
g) price is very good and highly reasonable and value for what you get"}
{"text":"My first time trying Burrito Boyz, and I was not disappointed.

This location seems to have lower rating compared to other locations. Although it is a franchise, I believe that the whole experience (service, cleanliness of the place, and quality of food (somewhat)) can be very different depending on the staff and the management. 

I got a small naked chicken burrito. Generous portions with chicken, rice, and refried beans but not so much on other toppings. Chicken was a tad too salty for my taste and lack of flavour (it was just salty). Guacamole looked and tasted like just mashed avocado. But overall, it was a good deal (~$8). I was content after the meal.

The service was quick and friendly, nothing to complain about. This place has a very spacious dining area (at least 8 tables) which is an asset compared to other locations. It is located in a huge plaza so parking is not a problem. I recommend this place if you want to quickly grab a bite (either dine in or take out)."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Burrito Boyz for a long time. Ever since it was just one location downtown (now called Burrito Bandidos), I've been going to Burrito Boyz.

This one is new, and is very clearly still getting the links worked out. 

The person who made my burrito did it VERY slowly. 

I recognized the girl who appeared to be managing from another location. She was repeatedly giving instructions about how to make the burritos. They didn't seem to be getting it. If she makes your burrito, it will be good. The other staff might make a mess of it. 

The one thing that they maintained is the noise and chaos levels from the other locations. I've always wondered why they don't turn the music down so they don't have to yell. They should use a paper ordering system or something to reduce the yelling back and forth.They also kept dropping the trays on the ground.  

I will go back with the hopes that it's up to the burrito boyz standard. I will hopefully upgrade my star rating at that time."}
{"text":"Best burritos in Toronto and the GTA hands down.  Ingredients are always fresh and the flavour combinations are always delicious.  I go at least once every two weeks!"}
{"text":"Best burritos in Toronto and the GTA by far.  I eat here almost once a week.  Enough said!"}
{"text":"Very happy with my steak burrito. I'm not a big fan of burritos. Never had one that was better than O.K. Usually just get one when I want something quick and filling.

But Burrito Boyz was def better than O.K. It was filled with food and was a decent price. I got a small which is still more than a pound for less than $7. It had a great taste so I really recommend this place for a great burrito."}
{"text":"Where to begin?  I ordered a steak burrito and added shrimp for another toonie. After selecting my choices for toppings ( no rice, add guacamole, a bit of salsa lettuce and a touch of hot sauce) the server sent my 1 pound, 2 ounce small burrito to the flattop for a bit of a sear. 

I was impressed to see my shrimp addition cooking in a pan.  These were 2 or 3 shrimp cocktail sized prawns, not some shrimpy sprinkleable sized units you would see at Made in Japan in the local food court. 

I combo'd with homemade tortilla chips and some of the freshest, chunkiest guacamole I have ever enjoyed. 

Messy, delicious, and I'm so glad I did not get anything larger than a small!

My only complaints:  the didn't fix me up with some much needed industrial sized napkins (or was that my job?), and no tables for a sit down meal when you are too impatient to get the food to your destination intact!"}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings about BB. I had the steak burrito and it was good .. much better then chains like Mucho Burrito. In fact the size on the small steak $7.50 is at least a medium or a large at Mucho.
Yet.. something was off. The meat less juicy and flavors were different. I guess I just miss the days of Burrito Boyz after clubbing downtown or Summer time in Port Credit when this was \"The Place\" to go to."}
{"text":"Pretty good burrito for someone who doesn't have burritos very often! The wait was a bit long, but it was bearable. I would come back again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food every time! Usually order chicken burrito or chicken mixed with shrimp. Always fresh ingredients. A great way to get a fresh meal that is very filling. Great quesadilla as well. Very good idea to call ahead to place order if in a rush but if not, there are plenty of seats available. Only issue is sometimes music is too loud. I don't mind the tunes but if i can't hear my order being called or have to yell my order its not fun."}
{"text":"Very large portions for very good pricing (under $8 for a chicken burrito bowl)! Especially good after a workout or if you want to fill up.

I used to come here a few times a week when I worked in the area.

The vegetables are fresh and aplenty. Compared to some other places (such as Bandidos, which I sometimes go to simply because it's closer), they have more selection on veggies and also fresher."}
{"text":"It's like the Canadian chain of a popular American burrito bowl restaurant. BUT- far more affordable. I enjoyed my chicken burrito bowl. It was large, full of rice, cooked to order chicken! And plenty of toppings that don't cost extra!
Service was very pleasant. Looks like you can order ahead and pick up as I saw a man come by to get his order."}
{"text":"Great honking serving sizes and generous servings of multiple fresh veggies if you want them, but dang it, it just doesn't have the flavor! 

I was hoping to capture some of the Mission (San Francisco) hole-in-the-wall deliciousness and authenticity, but sadly I felt I might be able to make a more delicious burrito at home. There's just no flavor or seasoning. I don't know what it is - it looked amazing, smelled freaking amazing, and the my party of 3 couldn't wait to just inhale our halibut and chicken burritos and chicken quesadilla as we drove away. However, It just doesn't have....it."}
{"text":"I feel like the quality of meat has went downhill, texture is starting to feel like grounded up tuna... use to be one of my favs! What happen?"}
{"text":"I've been going to Burrito Boyz for years. Love their ingredients and frying style. Halibut is the best by far. A chicken and shrimp combo is always a good choice too. And guacamole is included like it should be."}
{"text":"The quesadillas are amazing and I love the soy meat one (it's a little on the spicy side) but I think some other places have more variety for flavours in terms of burritos. I would recommend the quesadillas over the burritos. Still worth a visit"}
{"text":"Amazing. Simply amazing.

It's cheap. It's big. It's delicious. It's fresh. Need I say more?

Oh. It's a bit crowded during lunch hours. But that's really the only bad thing I can say about this place. If you want some good Tex-Mex, you've come to the right place, friend."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my burrito at all. I ordered the large chicken burrito. It was a decent size but the chicken did not taste like chicken I don't know what I was eating. It was really dense and chewy and had a weird taste to it that ruined the whole burrito. It did not feel like I was eating a burrito more like a horrible wrap. The two stars are for the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Was there last weekend, I have only had burrito once before so I won't be comparing this with other Burrito shops. I got a steak burrito super spicy and it was delicious, made me realize i was missing out on such great food. 

They did take quite long to make my burrito so I can't say the service is super fast. I didn't quite like the dark environment and empty spaces they have going on there. However, I can personally ignore all of that because the burrito I had was delicios for a very reasonable price.

This would be my first choice if I am ever craving burritos."}
{"text":"Came in for get a gluten-free burrito, what I opened up smelt 100% like whole wheat so I went to check with the girl at the cash and she said \"yep! Gluten-free!\" Without even looking at it. I was starving and had paid, so I did eat it. And was instantly sick as a result. When people ask if something is gluten-free, it isn't to be a pain it the butt, it's because we don't want to end up paying to be sick all day."}
{"text":"Not bad! Staff were very friendly, and my friend and I were very happy they were open later on a Monday. Everything closes so early Monday's we were afraid we'd have to get generic take out. But thankfully these guys saved our butts! It's pretty clean inside, and the ingredients look fresh. 
I got a quesadilla with steak and chicken. It was pretty good, good portions of both meats. I did enjoy it, my friend got a burrito, with steak and sweet potato. But she was disappointed with the lack of steak. It was mostly sweet potato, she only found 2 pieces of steak in the whole large burrito. 
Over all this place came in the clutch for us, I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Open late & great for post-club eating! Small venue one floor down from street level.

Friendly service & upon receiving my food, I was like \"omfg\", never have I picked up such a heavy & solidly packed burrito!  I had the wholewheat chicken burrito with guacamole, lettuce, tomato, rice, jalapeño, hot sauce, & beans which was so flavorful, moist & most satiating. 

I want to try the halibut burrito next visit as it seems to hold the consensus of popularity."}
{"text":"No complaints about this location. I always call and place my order by phone and pick up within 10 minutes. It is always ready and fresh. Burrito doesn't fall apart on me and they load up the burrito to max. Overall, good location and worth the value you pay for. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Ok so this location is the cleanest burrito boys I have ever seen!!! Spotless! And the staff is super friendly. 

Also they filled my burrito and wrapped it perfectly no spillage and no leaking. 

I'm super happy with this location, I will return over and over again if it stays as clean as it is now! 

I had the beans and rice burrito and my mom had the sweet potato burrito on a gluten free tortilla. Both were great!"}
{"text":"Great as any of the other Burrito Boyz are but the one thing that sucks is location. It's on one of the busiest streets and also the worst intersection in Mississauga. Parking? Forget about it! So if you are public transporting it or in the area, great. If not I'd go to a less congested location. As I said though the burritos are the same pretty much at any of the chains of BB's you'll go to, so if you choose to brave the traffic and congestion, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I believe that it's one of the best around that area because the people seem to be always lining up for it (regardless of the weather, believe me I know).. and you have to try it out if your into burrito or would like to try something new. It's very filing and super affordable that you wont even regret it.

The place is kind of small but I think that's what makes it charming. The people who work there are upbeat and it's fun to watch them make a burrito in front of you. Also, their very peanut conscious (if your allergic to peanuts). And oh, they ONLY take cash... so make sure to withdraw money while your at it. They do have a small atm machine inside the store but I never liked the idea of withdrawing money from there since it's so crowded at times.

Do visit this place when your around the area and see how you like it!"}
{"text":"For my food adventure with MealPal I enjoyed a beef-chicken burrito today as take-out, it was yummy, very filling, nicely toasted. The place was full during lunch time and there was line-up, luckily with MealPal my meal was ready waiting for me, I was planning to eat half of it (it was small size) but before I know it I have finished it :))"}
{"text":"Really love the food here! It's my favourite go to place for a quick bite! Only negative is when I ordered a naked shrimp, it came with 3 shrimp, not exactly what I was looking for after paying what I did. Other then that I love it!"}
{"text":"Aw man! This is THE very first time I've ever down graded my rating on a place, but I gotta do it. 

I go to Burrito Boyz whenever I'm craving a shrimp and calamari burrito. No change in the process, still quick and friendly. They used to offer complimentary tortilla chips made fresh in house, then they switched over to multicolored chips that tasted like they were store bought, and now none *sigh*

My burrito was still stuffed with delicious and fresh ingredients but when I unwrapped it there was a split in the middle; no problem,  I was planning to split it with hubby anyway. The tortillas they're using now are noticeably thinner and not as sturdy as before. My half of the burrito split again as I was eating it, making it very messy to finish. Maybe next time I'll try a naked burrito instead. Sorry Burrito Boyz now you're just ok."}
{"text":"Coming back to this place reminded me of those good old party days when I'd used to come here after hitting the clubs. Down the stairs we go and into Burrito Boyz. 
Though this time rather than coming here in the weee morning hours, I decided to head out for lunch with a coworker. Lets just say it can get chaotic in here due to the office lunch rush! It kind of makes you wonder what's the capacity of this joint?
With the amount of orders backed up, I opted for their EXPRESS...Chicken and Steak express which had everything in it. At an approximate cost of $8 each, holding one of these burritos and walking back to the office is like walking with light-weights.
As heavy as it was, it tasted delish!.....overall great place."}
{"text":"I'm going to give Burrito Boyz a good rating because they make a very good burrito, undeniably. But for me the place is a little \"young.\" Without sounding too crabby as I'm really not that old, the music is loud - very loud, the service is on the slow side, the prices are on the high side, and their menu is limited to burritos and quesadillas (aka flat burritos). So there seems to be a trendiness at play here that seems more important than being a food establishment. That's a bit unappealing to me."}
{"text":"The people working there were very nice at least the girl who was making my food was, she was super sweet didnt seem like she was annoyed or anything at work which most places are. The food was okay i dont like the salsa. Their steak was super dry. Only positive is the portion size. I had a naked steak burrito no rice/beans."}
{"text":"I\ve been coming here for lunch about twice a week for the past 3 months. My colleague comes here basically everyday. Come before 11:30 to skip the line. It gets packed around noon, but they still manage to serve the burritos pretty fast. Though, they can get pretty loud and scary during prime hours. I've had the large steak burrito over 10 times and it never disappoints. They really pack a heavy burrito and it's really cheap too. A lot cheaper than Burrito Bandidos, and better tasting. The quesadilla is pretty good too, though it can get very cheesy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Burritos are amazing, but that's not why I'm writing this review. I placed a large order for my office and went to pick it up at lunchtime. When one of the employees saw that we would have trouble carrying it all back, he offered to help us carry everything back. Great customer service and great experience, we will definitely continue to order from here."}
{"text":"I had a veggie burrito here early last week, and in hindsight it was just okay. This burrito joint, though in an awesome location (a short walk from the pier) relies upon style more than substance. Speakers blaring out Katy Perry's latest, unfortunately, and minions wearing cute beanies with ample piercings in questionable areas . Am I getting too old to understand why a 'monroe' seems like a good idea? 

Anyway, though I always love a solid helping of guacamole my burrito seemed a little, lacking, considering the fanfare and line up at BB. I would have liked a little more cheese and a little more spice. Strange, since I'm not very tolerant to it and I did order Medium Salsa. Maybe I should go with the flow and order a Bro Ho Burrito on my next visit?"}
{"text":"Best Burrito Boyz of them all in my opinion. They always cook the burritos perfectly here, compared to some of the other places where the grill is too hot and it cooks the outside quickly but leaves the inside cold. It's also a super cheap meal!"}
{"text":"Came here and asked for a Carne Asada burrito the person who was making my order didnt even know what carne asada  or  salsa verde meant anyways burrito wasnt the best tasted like something i could get at the neighborhood taco bell  nothing like taquerias here in california. Next time im in Brampton ill try not to eat a burrito especially at burrio boys and wait till i get back to Cali"}
{"text":"Excellent. Great, fresh food, large (a burrito is two meals for me) portions, the only negative is the music was a bit loud. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw this place was opening up in my neighbourhood. Apparently other people were excited as well, this place is always packed.  The inside is small but its really only for take out. They have friendly staff and there is loud music playing. It's also usually pretty hot inside too. 
They serve only two things burritos and quesadillas. I've only ever had the steak burrito and the halibut burrito. Both were extremely tasty. The hot sauces are HOT! Just a warning! The guacamole is really good too. 
Tip: you can call ahead and place your order"}
{"text":"I LOVE this location!
I only recently in the past year was introduced to Burrito Boyz and their food is really good.
I usually get the Chicken Quesadilla with sour cream.
The portions are HUGE I rarely finish it.
This location in particular is my favourite because their food tastes much better and tastier than other locations.
AND they have a sitting area!
1 location downtown has a small sitting area and we usually end up standing because it's always full.
another location has zero seating only benches outside.
This location has a large sitting area with tvs that you can watch the news on.
Very cozy, Great food, great service! :)"}
{"text":"I love this burrito boyz location! 
Literally 5 minutes from my house and i've had both burritos and quesadillas at this location and found them delicious each time! 
Prime location, fast and friendly staff and fresh ingredients makes this place a great change to your basic takeout. 

A++"}
{"text":"filling. well priced. late hours. yum. farts."}
{"text":"So this place is great for literally anything at anytime!! They are open so late it is so friggin great in downtown Toronto, right next to all the hopping bar scene. 

I ordered a quesadilla, chicken and had it with the extra spicy sauce and it was delicious. The guy making it in the back was literally taking his time to properly grill it and it was perfectly crunchy and so fresh and delicious. 

My friend had the burrito and the other had a vegetarian salad. Both looked so phenomenal. It was clear that it the ingredients were fresh and it was obviously prepared with lots of care. 

Service was fast, location was clean and overall good experience. Would definitely return for some fast casual food. They are open til like 4 am so it is definitely a great place to stop in for some great bites."}
{"text":"The steak burrito on the menu is misleading.

It is not really steak at all.

A steak is a slice of finely cut meat.  Not ground beef! Because if you order a steak burrito at Burrito Boyz, ground beef is what you're going to get.  

There was once upon a time where Burrito Boyz did serve proper steak meat, but for some reason recently they switched over to ground beef and still call it steak.

This is misleading. It just does not taste the same anymore. One can go to Chipotle where they serve a proper steak burrito.  

However, because it is the suburbs, late diners beyond 12am do not have much of a choice to satisfy their hunger other than McDonald's, or Tim Horton's. So Burrito Boyz will have to do."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch a few weeks ago, since it is close to my work.  I got the chicken burrito and it was delicious!   

Why I had not gone before? Because other times when I passed by or wanted to go, the parking lot is always full.  They are located in the small plaza with limited parking.  You might be able to park on the side street beside it, but not 100% sure if you risk getting a ticket.  That would be the only con for me for this location.  There is actually plenty of space inside, as it seems like they took over 2 units.  I didn't go to the other room, but saw some chairs/tables.

It had been a while since I had been to a Burrito Boyz. I was looking at the toppings on the menu and saying what I wanted as I went along, when the lady making it asked me if I wanted cheese/beans/rice. I guess I forgot those go first lol.  Would return for sure, if there is room to park."}
{"text":"I don't visit Burrito Boyz as often as I used to but when I do, the food is always top notch. Hands down the best fast food in the city.

The portions are a bit big so you might want to stick with the small. Always be careful about going overboard with filling up your burrito. You might be tempted to shove your burrito with everything but it'll just make it huge and leaky."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, but the last three times they either got our order wrong, or there was terrible customer service. Being left on hold and forgotten about when we tried to call in an order, and then the first time when they messed up our take out order I called and they gave us two free sauces with our next order. Unfortunately the next order was wrong too and I didn't think it was worth it to call. No chicken on the chicken nachos we ordered, retried beans on a burrito that we asked for no retried beans, forgetting to put burrito sauce in the order.... I wouldn't recommend this place anymore."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz serves decent burritoes. The ingredients are fresh and they also give you the option to have a naked burrito which is healthier. The halibut burrito is probably one of the better ones that I've had. However, some of my friends have said that the fish has been overcooked some of the times they got it which is a real downer because whenever I've gotten it, the halibut melted once you bit into it. If I get the steak burrito, I try to turn it into a steak fajita burrito by not adding beans and throwing in the peppers and onions along with some fiery hot sauce. Even though this XXX sauce that they have is a killer. Overall, a decent place for mexican. Qdoba is still better."}
{"text":"All I have to say is this place is the burrito of burritos. My BF has got them many times and evreyone i know knows this place. The burritos are huuuge and filling as F***. Always wrapped to perfection and delish. Has Never failed, ever, to impress. What more can you ask for from a burrito."}
{"text":"Great place! Such a great selection and even gluten free! The meat could be a little spicier but Im from the south so, I like it spicy. I didn't get the burrito sauce and I think that might be where I messed up haha. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This was a very random, late night skip the dishes order. I was asleep all day (yay night shifts) and at about 2 a.m. in the morning I was starving, I decided I wanted burritos. The only place available so late on a Saturday night was Burrito Boyz. As I've heard really good things and my bf was willing to try their food we decided to get the staples, we ordered a chicken quesadilla, chicken burrito and steak burrito. All items were flavorful, the ingredients were obviously fresh and the quality was exceptional. I don't particularly like that the meat seems really chopped up to an almost odd texture, I prefer large strips of chicken and steak... as opposed to very chopped up pieces, but that bothered me because I don't particularly like odd textures that throw me off, so that was entirely a personal preference. I did like that they had a lot of variety to choose from for the filling, such as lots of veggies etc. 
Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz has quality food, but so often douchy employees..  hipster/too cool to put beans on your burrito types...  more interested in discussing their boring weekend plans, singing poorly to crappy music and how many hours until we can close types.."}
{"text":"It's burrito Boyz ...what more is there to say , if you've tried one you've tried them all . It's clean it's fresh and nice and tasty . Staff at this location seem friendly as most locations . The plaza it's in has decent parking .
It's a good alternative to l lots of fast foods and more healthy ."}
{"text":"i was finally able to convince myself to break out of my norm and try something else besides the halibut and haddock burrito.  i had a steak and shrimp burrito and it was sooooooo good it was like a surf & turf burrito!!  i had yet to have a burrito here that wasn't good and now they are open late on weekends which gives me another late night option besides the 1000 korean restaurants around this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I went to Burrito Boyz after the Jays game on Monday. My boyfriend and I went to grab a bite because the food at the Rogers Centre is very expensive.
It is a small take-out restaurant that serves mostly burritos, but also serves quesadillas and what they call a \"naked burrito\" (which is everything in a burrito but without the shell).
This location has a multitude of proteins for your burrito including steak, chicken and even fish. They did have vegetarian options such as veggie soy and sweet potato.
I usually go to the Mississauga Burrito Boyz, but this location did not disappoint!
I got the veggie soy burrito on whole wheat without the beans and rice (I find it is really heavy in the stomach with it).I usually love spicy food so I also got it hot. My boyfriend got the large steak with everything inside.
Both of them were beyond delicious and were made super quick.
I seriously suggest the veggie soy if you want to try something different. Had the consistency of beef but had (in my opinion) more flavor than just the regular steak. It had lots of different spices added to it, and complimented the flavor of the burrito.
I would highly suggest a burrito from Burrito Boyz to anyone.
Only suggestion is maybe grab a fork (I know it is lame) as it can be very messy and stuffed to the brim. You need to use the fork to eat some of the burrito before taking another bite.
ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Delicious and amazing. Burrito Boyz is always a great choice for a late night eat. 
Tons of choices, from chicken, steak and shrimp to vegetarian choices like veggie soy and sweet potato. 
I got the naked burrito Aka all the goodness of a burrito but without the tortilla. 
I got a mix of veggie soy and sweet potato which was amazing. 
My boyfriend got the large steak burrito
Both fantastically delicious and good with price.
The service was fast and efficient as well as extremely nice. 
I would recommend this location to anyone. 
Especially if you are planning to go see a movie later.. So you don't have to spend the extra money on food there."}
{"text":"My friend and I didn't care for this place at all. First of all, the woman taking orders was impatient and pushy. I didn't like her attitude. Secondly, it took a while for them to cook the burrito and quesadilla and my friend's ended up burnt. When she returned it, they gave her another one which was undercooked. Mine was just OK, nothing to write home about. And to top it off, the speakers blasting the music were really bad; sounded like the music was coming out of a shoebox. This is like a glorified Taco Bell with higher prices. I wish I had something positive to say...well it does have a convenient downtown location. That's all I got."}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful. Not sure how so many people love this place but it was literally the worst \"Mexican\" I've ever had. I had a burrito bowl with \"steak\" which looked and tasted like dried up ground beef. I had to force myself to eat it. It's not difficult to make a burrito bowl. My boyfriend had a burrito and his description is just plain nasty.  We sat there looking at all the Zagat awards on the wall and I thought to myself we must be being punkd. The employees were awesome but I will stay as far away from this place as possible."}
{"text":"Delicious as per usual. I noticed no difference from the other location, really. I got the large haddock - it was super fresh. The wait was a little long but it's understandable since the fish was soooo fresh. All the ingredients looked fresh and the place was clean. Will absolutely come back!!!"}
{"text":"The staff forgot the beans in my burritos AGAIN! Everyone wants to take your money but no body cares about providing good service. This country is going downward very fast. The parking lot is full of broken glass and cigarettes, and shady looking people. I would not hang out there after sun down. Thanks Trudeau for making Canada a third world country and Mississauga Mayor, now we are equal to everyone else. open borders. I should return to India. At least the food is much cheaper. Maybe I will move to USA to visit family. USA truly is the last great democracy where they believe in customer service. Without USA the world would be under socialist rule. People actually care about doing a good job in the States, here we got people making almost $15 per hour, $30K per year, (soon) making bad burritos. Why do people believe Socialism is good. It always ends badly for the citizens. Look at Venezuela!"}
{"text":"situated strategically in a big business district, slapping tortillas around themselves non stop is a place that is burrito boyz.  anyone who knows of burritos in the city, knows this place.  

they offer honking burritos, filled with your choice of steak, chicken, beans or fish.  the guys that work there are fast and to the point.  theyve also got a solid handle on handling their customers in terms of order and expedition of orders.  be prepared to wait because itll be worth it.  theres nothing mindblowing about the ingredients, as they offer what most places would; perhaps what distinguishes them is sauces they put on.  either way, they are very tasty and filling whether you are on break from work or stumbling out of the club.  if you like it spicy, then it damn well will be. if not say so.

after just visiting the website, i found out that there will no longer be a location on peter street.  check their website for locations and ones to follow in your hood."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and made right infront of you!!
Their chicken and shrimp burritos are the best in sauga with great pricing, They're usually super crowded.
Love their chicken quesadilla as well.
Totally worth every cent!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the most fulfilling meal you can get for under $10. All burritos are made to order,  and the servers are always friendly. Personally, I do the half chicken half sweet potato mix. I used to have to go to big fat burrito to do that mix, but ever since burrito Boyz added sweet potato to their menu I've been doing that here. Whether you're looking for after club drunk food,  or you're just too lazy to make dinner that night, burrito Boyz is a delicious, cheap, and quick option. 

On my last visit there they forgot to add chicken to my burrito and just gave me sweet potato. After informing them of the mistake, not only did they make me a new burrito, they let me keep the first one, AND gave me a card for a free burrito on my next visit. That's good customer service right there."}
{"text":"As I was having an internal debate whether or not to order room service when I got back to my hotel (or just go to sleep), I stumbled across a burrito boyz. It was destiny. Quality food at a much more reasonable price. I love this place and the burrito. Staff was great."}
{"text":"Great spot for burritos. The filling don't get weird, so it's safe to just ask for everything.

Normal burritos are slow because they need to heat them thoroughly. 

Instead go for the 'naked burrito'. A meat / rice / vegetable plate. They're super quick and delicious.

If you're going as a group make sure that you don't get a mix of naked / normal burritos. The naked burrito eaters will be finished before the regular burrito eaters get their food."}
{"text":"Mmmmm Burrito Boyz..... Steak burrito is tops... I've been wanting to try one of the seafood ones but haven't been able to turn down the steak at every visit..."}
{"text":"Great food (really amazing burritos) but not cheap and crowd is kinda iffy (lots of punks hang around it and its in a meh neighborhood)."}
{"text":"This little basement kitchen is hidden away in the heart of the entertainment district on Adelaide. This spot is almost legendary as everyone has been and if you haven't someone will freak out when they find out and take you. Once you walk down the stairs and enter the basement door you will find a few small tables, a bar with stools by the window, and a large glass display that has all the burrito ingredients for gawking. 

The large burritos are very large, and feel as if they are about 2lbs in weight. The fillings are fresh and very tasty but I wouldn't consider them to be authentic Mexican as they lack that certain spice. The best thing about the burrito is not the price or the size but the tortilla, they grill them so they get crunchy on the outside and are able to hold all of the contents in the burrito and not in your hands. The staff are friendly and quirky and are up for conversation as long as you don't go during the rush lunch or post club rush. 

Overall, Burrito Boyz is a good place to come when you want a lot of food for little money. The taste is fresh, burritos are stuffed, and the service is fast. Take your burrito to go so you can grab a nice seat elsewhere. Watch out for the lunch rush because it is crazy."}
{"text":"Food is bland with no flavor.
I've ordered from here twice.  First time found a hair in my burrito and didn't go back for years! Decided to try again and they got my order wrong when I picked up and didn't notice till I got home. 
I am done with this place."}
{"text":"I went here just to grab a quick bite to eat and because of all the hype around Burrito Boyz. I've never tried this place, and frankly i don't think i will ever again. 

I ordered the chicken burrito with calamari (costed extra) and it ended up being an almost $15 order. I waited about 10 minutes seeing as they were a bit busy (it was during lunch time) and after receiving my order, I was upset to find only 5 small pieces of calamari after I had already payed extra. The rice and beans were okay - nothing to be amazed about. If anything, i thought the beans were dry and too mushy. The container was barely filled-something i was not happy about after spending as much as i did. 

I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"As an American that has lived near the Mexican border...this place...amazing. Go now"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place.. This is truly bang for buck here. 8 bucks for a good size burrito... can't complain at all.. One of the best food spots in the b-town"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town, and this was my first time here. Most of my experience with burritos is from NYC, so I want sure what to expect. But these guys had the most reviews of anyplace in a four block radius of where I was, so I gave it a shot. 

I ordered the Naked Large Haddock Burrito, which in the US is called a burrito bowl.  The amount of food you get for the price is very good. The takeout container was about eight inches square (20 cm for you Canadians) and was packed with Mexican goodness. It cost $9.50, which was only $7.60 USD.  

No skimping on the rice, beans, guacamole, or salad. The piece of Haddock was huge. I was disappointed that it was deep fried. But that was my bad for not asking before ordering. I stripped away most of the coating and the fish was nice and flaky inside. 

I would recommend this place for anyone looking for fast Mexican food."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken burrito!  You get waaay more than you pay for (which is hard to find nowadays).  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"First time here and my first impression is that it's very unorganized and confusing because I didn't know where to stand in line to order.
I ordered a small shrimp bowl and I have to say that the food is awesome and fresh, just was kind of surprised that I only got 5 shrimps, but I'll know to get a med or large next time lol:)"}
{"text":"I love this chain; they beat out any other burrito place by miles. My regular order is a large naked burrito (essentially a burrito salad) with haddock/shrimp. I love that guacamole is included - and it has real avocado chunks (isn't just a powdered mix)! I also love how fresh everything is, and that they mix 2 proteins/\"types\" without extra charge. I wish lime was included and not extra. LOVE that the beans, rice and guac are vegan. 

My one big gripe is that the downtown Toronto location gives me less food than the London, ON location - at least a quarter less! Not exactly what I'd call equal value. They are also not as fast or friendly; I was unimpressed at the rude, apathetic counter girl who clearly thought she was too good for this job. But whoever picked up the phone was polite, and my order was ready shortly after I arrived. However, I asked for everything but onions but there was a distinct lack of cheese.... I do feel somewhat cheated.

The fish in both locations melts in your mouth, but the shrimp is distinctly rubbery in Toronto. (I've eaten many times in both, so I feel able to compare)."}
{"text":"Decent with large portions. A little on the bland side. Not sure if it is because everything is so mixed in so has the same texture in the end.  

If you order halibut or other seafood make sure you are prepared to wait as those items takes longer than other fillings.

Can be busy but they are very quick.  Small parking.  I have never been able to park and had to on the side street."}
{"text":"These poor reviews are clearly from fat bastard fans who are biased. Burrito Boyz opened up recently and fat bastard is now empty half the time as a result. Nothing tops burrito Boyz in the GTA and they have so many locations for a reason. Try the halibut one here and then the only fish option from fat bastard and tell me which one is better."}
{"text":"The large bean and cheese burrito tasted like mush. It fell apart. I used to like this place but either it's gone downhill or I've developed a taste for better, like Quesada.

Plus, they won't give you a glass of water? Inexcusable."}
{"text":"Returning to this place many times since my last review, I have to give them a better rating.

Their burritos are fairly consistent, and their hours help for those long days, and you're just too lazy and tired to cook dinner, and you need a quick fix.

Despite their new methods of controlling quantity (by using scoops), everything is still nice and generous and you get a nice filling meal in a burrito."}
{"text":"As everyone has said, this is the place to be after you've finished work or going to the club and your a little drunk.

The burritos are big, spicy and \"juicy\". But the quesadillas aren't as good. 
When you go here at night (Especially Saturday night) expect to wait in line for some time.

A simple review for a simple place.
Come here if your drunk and wanting to eat something other than hot dogs"}
{"text":"I guess this really started for me as a late night place after the clubs. My first time at burrito boyz was on Adelaide street. I still remember how my friends talked about it all the time. They assured me that I would not be dissapointed. They were right.

You can pretty much compare burrito boyz to a mucho  burrito or a subway (with burritos). First you select you main filling and then your tortilla type. After that you're given an option of ingredients to fill your burrito with. Afree an option of fresh vegetables, salsa, guacamole, and sauce your burrito is taken hostage in order for it to be filled and grilled. It takes a little bit but I figure it crunchifies the tortilla and melts everything together all nice. 

My favorite is the halibut burrito, which has a giant piece of fish in it. I've also tried the haddock and was just as impressed. 

I'm pretty sure that whatever location you go to you'll be pleased. Fair warning though... Adelaide gets RIDICULOUSLY busy at night."}
{"text":"Steak and Shrimp is bomb here and for very cheap. Great service and they're very fast. Went back here  twice after that first time."}
{"text":"Came here by myself for a late lunch. There was no line but waited a bit for my order.  I ordered the steak and chicken burrito...naked style which is just without the tortilla. You can combine two different meats and there's also a gluten free option. I got all the toppings and the spicy option. After tax it came down to $8.50. There was a good ratio of meat, avocado and salad. For one person the small size was definitely enough.  I would recommend this place if you're craving mexican food and looking for a quick bite with only 10 bucks to spare :)  On a side note found it was interesting that all the employees were women despite it being called burrito boyz..just an observation haha."}
{"text":"Burrito, burrito! Can't say enough how much the chicken and steak mix hits the spot when you don't feel like cooking. It's pure goodness wrapped up. The key to not making a mess of yourself is to wrap up the bottom like a pocket. Try the halibut too!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place. Literally crave the seafood burrito all the time. Every bite is heaven. They never mess up my order and service is great. Wishing they had a burrito boyz in Buffalo cuz I would be there daily!! Can't wait till I'm in Toronto next week to devour the best burrito I have ever had anywhere!! Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"Worst burrito boyz I have ever had.  This location has never been good.  Dry meat, over salted rice and beans. I will have to try a something else!  I love the USA, great independent Mexican food restaurants on every corner.  Maybe Taco Bell can do better!"}
{"text":"Lol these guys just weighed my box and said I couldn't have any more rice in my bowl, wtf ? Truly a new level in cheap fuckery"}
{"text":"Overrated, low-grade junk food.  Have bitten into a chicken bone in my burrito that seemed to be 80% gristle and underseasoned chicken meat.  Typical sloppy toppings and disgustinig \"burrito sauce\" makes it a heavy, sloppy mess.  Only one burrito I'd even consider ordering here and it's the shrimp.  At least it's cooked to order, from raw.  This location is the size of a prison cell, and plays annoying techno music while you wait with your number like the soup nazi episode from Seinfeld."}
{"text":"Overrated junk.

It blows me away how Torontonians have such poor taste in food.  How this place remains to be popular and opening more locations than a McDonalds is beyond me.  The meat is underseasoned, low quality, and full of gristle.  I've actually bitten into a BONE in the chicken burrito which was the final straw for me, after almost chipping a tooth.  Calling this a \"staple\" of any sort is quite the claim, and I almost feel bad for you if this is something you're eating so regularly.  You can do MUCH better than this, people.  Give me a break.  If you at least want semi-authentic flavors then go to El Sombrero in Mississauga.  If you want a sloppy burrito full of junk food, cooked by pimply faced teenagers playing techno music, then Burrito Boyz is the place for you."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place but I really do not mind waiting in the long lines to get my hands on the nice crisp, fresh, and made to order burrito.

This place is crazy, there are constantly and consistently long lines of people no matter what time of the day you go. The staff are very friendly and are very quick even though it may not seem like it because of the long waits.

Obviously the thing to get is a burrito, but which one? Well you can choose from steak, chicken, halibut, shrimp and vegetarian, or you can combine any of the two just have to pay a little bit more. 

There are two different sizes, small or large, but honestly I really do not see the difference between the two, I've had both and the small one fills me up just the same as the large so save your money and stick with the small. 

Besides burritos they have quesadias. The quesadias come with the same ingredients as the burritos however they are brutal. I ordered it the one time and haven't ordered it since because I couldn't eat it with my hands I had to take it home and eat it with a fork and I don't EVER recall eating quesadias with a fork before have you?

Great place that will definetly fill you up.

Things to definetly get

-Shrimp burrito with everything on it with a line of hot sauce."}
{"text":"One star for customer service and rude behaviour.......nobody in the store is polite. We are here for food not for the attitude. 

Please improve the customer service. They don't even deserve one star ."}
{"text":"My late-night go-to.

When my cousins and I are hungry and are craving burrito, this place always hits the spot.  I appreciate that they generous with the toppings and they are fast with their service.  I don't think I've ever been at this place where there is no line-up and for the amount of people in there, we don't end up waiting that long.

I only get the small size and even then, I sometimes have a hard time finishing it because it's so much!  So much goodness!

If you're hungry late at night, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Very slow service and our order was messed up. To be in the busiest highway they need some improvement! Food was only ok."}
{"text":"I find some of the choices to not be as flavourful as others. The fishes and the calamari, although more expensive, are the best choice of meats. The steak and chicken can be dry and chewy. All the toppings are fresh, and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I love things that encase all the yummy goodness in one  neat wrap (preferably in cylindrical shape) which I can wrap my little hands around it and put it in my mouth without worrying about spills. Naturally, burritos, street meat,shwarmas and pitas(well maybe not so much- open pockets suck) are my favorite  walk-and-eat food.

For awhile I had mistaken Burrito Banditos for Burrito Boyz - another lovely spot - but I have finally made it here and this is what I think.

Everyone is friendly and they even look like they are having fun working together - which is a plus and a must if you work in food industry.

I've been here several times now - rarely is it not busy -but even on a very slow day, the food doesn't seem to get to you faster. Now I don't know if they intentionally grill the thing a little longer so the smell of the food drives your hungry mind insane- but it does, and the appreciation for the flavour is definitely heightened. It also keep the burrito warmer longer, which is perfect because it is a bit of a walk back to work.

The portion is perfect - you eat it when you're kinda hungry - you're stuffed. You eat it when you're starving - you're full without wanting to die.

The only thing - and this is just me I think - is that their mild is not mild. I say I want mild but I always think it's a little more hotter  than I want it - I'm trying to reduce my spice intake - I guess I just need to specify that I want bland.

Overall amazing. I don't recommend it though, if you are planning to try other places - the place sets the bar high and will, WILL inevitably ruin all existing burritos for you."}
{"text":"To be honest, I just feel this place is another form of Chipotle. Maybe it's my peasant taste bubs but the flavors did not wow me. Their store's name was more exciting them the actual burrito. I order the steak burrito and it was alright. It just felt like I was eating a regular burrito. It cost about $10+ but I would have been statisfied with a Taco Bell burrito. Those jawns have alot of flavor.

I crave for those burritos than here. Don't get me wrong. It is good to change it up once and a while. The atmosphere is very casual and low key. It seems more of a late night spot than a regular sober outing.

Overall, I'll stop by here after a night out if I'm nearby but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"This would be the off-shoot (or is it the original) location of the wonderful oasis that is Burrito Boyz.  They have the same menu, same line-ups, same you-gotta-get-your-arse-there deliciousness.  So, the question you have to ask yourself, why are the two locations so close?

A quick leap to GoogleMaps, and you find that the this and the Adelaide location (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/burrito-boyz-toronto-3) are a mere six minute walk apart, and I get the feeling that's making it a slow stroll with a bunch of window shopping and people gawking.  So why there?

It didn't really hit me until I walked through ClubLand on a Saturday.  Ah.  It's in the heart of the action, waiting for the 2:00am Fourth Mealers that stumble out of the clubs and pubs in the area looking for something to soak up the evils of the night.  It's a nice place, but I still prefer the Adelaide location.  You never forget your first Burrito Boyz and it's nice to stay loyal."}
{"text":"Typically, everyone's introduction to Burrito Boys begins with an incredulous look and \"You've never been to Burrito Boys???!?  Oh, man.  We're going!\"  Somewhat tucked away from downtown but hardly a large distance, Burrito Boys provides a nice lunchtime stroll for the office workers in the core that want to get out at lunch and enjoy a nice walk in the sun.  But note that Burrito Boys are so good it's worth fighting through (-40) degree weather to get some Mexican goodness.

Know this as well.  This location has a line-up that snakes through the restaurant and spills outside.  It's very popular and their number system they use to order has been working for them for some time.  You'll understand when you get there.

The burritos are huge, fresh, and tasty.  I typically get a small and that will fill and kill me for lunch.  Best thing to do is to grab your stuff to go and eat in a park, Nathan Phillips Square, or if you're really sad, your desk back at work.  The bonus of that is the smell from the burritos will drive your podmates batty to the point of getting their coats and making sure they've got enough for a small-steak-spicy."}
{"text":"FOOD: This is probably my favourite burrito place ever so far. They have amazing burritos and quesadillas which I love. They also have vegetarian options which taste amazing!!! The soy is AMAZING!!! The burritos are full of veggies and other stuff! Delicious and spicy hot sauce they include in the burritos! 

STAFF: Super kind, friendly, cool.

PRICE: $$$ 

WAIT: Can pre-order and pick up (easier) otherwise lineup depends on when you go."}
{"text":"Good, but prefer chipotle for sure.

Came here after a hard evening at beach volleyball and had a large chicken burrito with a coke zero. $10 and filled me right up, nice.

The burrito was stuffed and super filling. The taste is pretty good - they grill the chicken well and the toppings are added to the max. The sauces could do with a little improvement though. Asked for the hot out of the \"hot medium mild\" question, and could barely taste the heat. Also, it could've done with a little bit of tang - some tabasco or lime would've hit the spot perfectly.

The burrito itself was toasted perfectly dough - great crisp on the faces and nice chewy texture on the sides."}
{"text":"Terrific quality food and the price is right.  You genuinely get a lot for what you pay - and it's good!  you know it's a good spot when most people who come are the people who could drive anywhere: police, fire, ambulance, etc.

Call-in orders by phone for pick-up to avoid the line, and don't try to park nearby during the day as it's unbelievable busy.  Great way to end the night after a bar - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went to the downtown location for lunch on Adelaide St.  I got the regular size steak & chicken burrito.  It was a mealpal pick-up.  The ingredients consisted of rice, beans, cheese, cilantro, onions, salsa, tomatoes, sour cream, corn & burrito sauce.  This is one big hefty burrito,  no need to get the large.  The taste was just satisfying, this is just like comfort food.  Good fresh ingredients that is why Burrito Boyz is so popular.  I tried their burritos before and will try again."}
{"text":"Best. Burritos. Ever. I used to think Chipotle was the bomb, then I tried this flavourful wrapped piece of heaven, and I saw the light! Guac is not extra, AND they toast your burrito; Two things that I can't say for chipotle!"}
{"text":"This location is wacky. Asked for napkins: got burrito cases...
Asked for no guacamole: got guacamole. 
Nothing compared to the bigger burrito boyz that's a little farther from me."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp calamari burrito and it was pretty good. Ive never had calamari in a burrito or taco before but this was good. I think i shld have added hot sauce and burrito sauce as it lacked kick. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Id recommend it and ill be back for sure! Lots of food at a cheap price - my large burrito was only $10!"}
{"text":"Okay burritos. Paltry meat portions. Don't ever order online because the order will be wrong 9/10 times. You have to watch the staff closely as they aren't particularly good at making the burritos."}
{"text":"Recently went vegetarian, the veggie burrito was perfect. Cheers boyz!

PS: I like that you keep adding ingredients - try adding mango next pleeeeease."}
{"text":"One of the best burrito places I've been to! You don't have to pay extra for their guacamole (who wants to pay money for extra guac when you can get it here for free?) The staff members in this location are very friendly (and oh not to mention, they are all good looking too). The portions are big! I always get the naked chicken though and oh my it just puts me in a good mood every time I have it."}
{"text":"I always order the large halibut burrito whenever I go to this place. Halibut is lightly breaded. Staff is generous with the veggies and rice. Service can be a little slow when there a lot of people. 

Be careful with the hot sauce. A drop of it might be a little too much for some people"}
{"text":"This is the best burrito i've eaten in Canada, but having lived on the border of Mexico that isn't saying much.  I found it very odd that they fill your burrito with a large portion of rice and fresh vegetables and then warm the burrito up on the grill.  As somewhat of an expert in cooking burritos usually you warm it ( not toast it to a crisp) on the grill then fill it with meats and vegetables.  Obviously this is working for them by the number of awards and recommendations.  I certainly would be willing to go back as it offered a good value and the portions are good too."}
{"text":"Had the halibut burrito here a week or two ago. Ate the first half in the restaurant and enjoyed it. But truth be told, I liked it better a few hours later when it was cold. The flavors were just more prominent. (I didn't really taste the fish until it was cold.) I'll be getting the shrimp burrito next time to see how that is."}
{"text":"For a long time, Burrito Boyz was the place to get top notice burritos. Then Chipotle came along and that's all you heard about. I had an opportunity to eat at BB recently and the value and quality is still one of the best. 

I typically get a mix of steak and sweet potato. I love the addition of sweet potato (some may find it makes the burrito mushy) and the chewiness of steak. A large literally gets you 2+ lbs of food. It's enormous and I don't know how I use to eat it myself. Nowadays I get a burrito bowl with the pita on the side so it's a little more manageable (and less messy) to eat. 

Altogether whichever location you go to, I think this is still a go to place for a good burrito!"}
{"text":"VERY BUSY but great experience. Good food and fun scene."}
{"text":"Good food and good service every time. Can get really busy. You can call ahead for pickup."}
{"text":"Above and beyond customer service to go with their delicious food. Placed an online pick-up order and everything was perfect! Our go-to burrito place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Best place to go after a game or with a late night crave.

Chipotle has nothing on these guys. These buritos are fat, with lots of options and fresh everything. I usually actually get the giant salads which are mega size huge with lots of fresh ingredients, guacamole included, and a ton of meat. One of my favourite places to go. They're always busy, but apparently have a mobile app you can use OR call in your order ahead of time. 

The parking in this area kinda sucks though but shouldn't be too much of an issue."}
{"text":"Probably the worst burrito place I've been to. Found a hair in my food. Took way to long for my food to come (I was on my lunch break to top it off) The service was really bad. Theyre also very greedy with the guac."}
{"text":"For the rave reviews Burrito Boyz receives from my Co-Workers, and outside the office you would expect a bit more than the very 'processed' tasting burrito, and small portions. 

Chipotle, New York Subway, Mission Burrito, and even those crazy guys at Chino Locos have better meat, and fresher ingredient. The positive points would be serving fish burritos, which can be a rarity (but is becoming more common), and the guacamole is free where other places like to gouge you on it.

Like many popular joints Burrito Boyz is packed during the weekday lunch hour, and they have no short order of screwed up orders the few times I've been by. It must be brutal working in a high paced environment like that, but the customer service could use a make over as well.

Break the routine and try something else."}
{"text":"So my husband and I have had a long standing debate... who does the best burritos in town?  He has always been a Burrito Boyz fan, I however stood by Fat Bastards claiming they were the \"one to beat\" so we decided to do a good ol fashioned taste off.  We ordered the exact same thing at both Fat Bastards and Burrito Boyz.  

Here is what we found:  

ORDERING
Burrito Boyz.  When calling to place the order we were greeted with a friendly voice to take our order.  Placing the order took only a minute or two, and were told to pick the burrito's up in about 10-15 minutes.  Super quick!  
Fat Bastards.  When calling to place the order the chick on the phone seemed annoyed we were calling (I must add that I normally just walk in when ordering from Bastards) I was put on hold several times, just trying to place the order took me like 10 minutes....  We were told to pick up the burrito in about 15 minutes. NOT a good start.

PICKING UP THE ORDER
Burrito Boyz.  Quick and painless!
Fat Bastards.  Waited an additional 15 minutes because they were really really busy.

THE BURRITO
Burrito Boyz.  The small is big as hell and had a ton of extra guac, just how I like it.  Spiciness was just right and the bean, cheese, veggies ratio was good.  All in all, very pleased.   And only $6 for a bean and cheese with extra guac.  
Fat Bastards.  The Reg was smaller than a burrito boyz small, spiciness was great (I love a spicy burrito) I asked for extra guac and paid $1.00 for nothing because no extra guac was given.  Ratio was good, just wish they weren't being so chincy on the toppings.  Paid $10 for bean and cheese with extra guac.  

THE VIRDICT
Sadly... my long time fav (Fat Bastards) was quickly knocked down and beaten to a pulp by the Boyz.  After doing a side by side comparison and taste test Burrito Boyz wins in every aspect.  The service, quantity, quality and price were easily handed to the Boyz.  The only thing that might have me going back to Fat Bastards is the deep fried creations... not the burritos.  Ever since our test we are now regulars at Burrito Boyz and they even know us by name  and I'm not ashamed!!! hahaha  BURRITO BOYZ FOR THE WIN!"}
{"text":"I walked into this location looking for a decent bite and a quick meal. I ordered the small burrito with chicken with everything on it. When ordering the employee asked if I wanted mild or hot sauce. I said I'd take the hot sauce, and she warned me it was extremely spicy. I said I would still want it.

After getting the burrito, it was pretty standard fare. It's reasonably priced at $8, and the portion was fair. It was exactly what I had wanted at the moment, but if I want some better food I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I don't recommend ordering over the phone and simply going in to pay and pickup.  Done this a few times and every single time the order was made incorrectly (enough in the burrito, burnt, etc). Staff are friendly but a lot of the time are rude and give you a look when you ask for extra veggies in a rice & bean burrito."}
{"text":"Sometimes this pace can be very busy so doing a order over the phone and a quick pick up is best. But food is good and service is good as well."}
{"text":"omggggggg what an amazing burrito! thick and meaty, and fresh to DEATH! 

I will definitely be going back to try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"BurritoBoyz is one of those places that could be great, but seems content to be average. 

The \"small\" chicken burrito I had was close in size to a Chipotle burrito. Instead of paying 12.20$ at Chipotle for a burrito and pop, this burrito and pop was a deal at 7.90.
Chipotle gives unlimited pop refills, while Boyz includes guac in its burritos.
Beyond value is where things go off track a bit. While all of these things are correctable, they knock stars of the experience...

1. Customer service is average at best. The staff are not especially friendly (the guy running the grill is a positive exception) or proactive in checking on the customers for feedback while they are dining. I mentioned to the cashier that someone had left their gloves at the counter. She just looked at me and shrugged. (Later, I found the customer who left the gloves with minimal effort.)
2. The chicken could be of a higher grade/quality. It also comes in pieces that are too small.
3. Employees refill all of the ingredient bins straight out of plastic bags at the counter, giving an impression that the ingredients aren't fresh.
4. Peppers and onions would be better grilled.
5. My medium heat burrito had jalapeño peppers with seeds all in it. Jalapeño pepper seeds overpower any burrito.
6. The place seems clean, but open recycling bins and a wall of business cards makes the place look more cluttered and cheap than it should.

Improvements in customer service and food quality would make this place better and worth spending a couple extra bucks.

If you want a reasonably cheap burrito before a night out on College Street, this fits that bill."}
{"text":"Cliff's Notes on why I love this place:
 - open late (until 4AM on weekends)
 - cheap and great value - all the prices are set so it's round numbers after tax, so you don't walk around with change in your pockets like an asshole.
 - no extra charge for ingredients - Chipotle charges extra for guacamole. I was okay with this before I discovered Burrito Boyz. I used to love C.H.I.P.O.T.L.E.
 - haven't had a single dry bite due to careful burrito building
 - the burritoes are damned tasty - ingredients are fresh and they don't skimp on the pricey things
 - get the famous halibut if it's your first time here

The long version:

There's a lot of hype behind this place - my brother used to live in Toronto and mentioned Burrito Boyz as a spot that I *need* to go to. While tempting, I never had the opportunity. I mean, it's just a burrito joint, right? The Chipotle near my apartment serviced me well and Fat Bastard and Bandidos, while good, wasn't anything amazing.

Well, I finally got to check this point out yesterday... and today. Yup - I ate here twice in less than 24 hours.

While wandering the city on Nuit Blanche, we were close and hungry enough to try Burrito Boyz. Downstairs from a Smoke's and in the clubbing district, this is truly targetting the shit-faced crowd.

Coming here after midnight on a Saturday was a gong show. Long lineups and a huge crowd. All the yelling by the servers agitated me and I thought the system of ordering, paying, waiting a random amount of time, going back to the front to pick your toppings, and then waiting again for pick-up was painfully inefficient. Why not just ask for my toppings when I ordered?

After a long wait, C. charges outside with our order and tells me to 'Feel this' and drops our two large $11 (tax in) halibut burritos in my hands.

What the fuck! I nearly drop the burritos as I didn't expect to catch something that weighed the equivalent of a small child. This is great but I became concerned people love this place, not for the quality, but just for the portions.

Our plan was to eat 1/2 of our burritos and stash the remaining for the rest of the night as we were about midway through our Nuit Blanche Death March. With the size of the thing, a portion is more than enough to sate us and nothing says 'classy' like \"Art + Half Eaten Burrito\".

The plan failed miserably as we just beasted the whole thing down. We seriously could not stop eating it. The halibut was delicious - unlike most burritos where you can't tell 1/2 the time what protein you picked, the ingredients were fresh and balanced. Eating it fresh, I could even taste the crunchy fish batter for first 1/3 of the burrito before all the other goopiness from the salsa, cream, guacamole. hot sauce and beans took over. Like a good Tex-Mex burrito, it was very rich, creamy satisfying, but you can actually taste the ingredients.

Not sure if I was eating it wrong or the huge crowds resulted in a sloppy wrap job, but the burrito structure eventually collaped near the base and I had to ravenously half eat/half slurp the last 10% of the burrito. After ingesting this huge gut bomb, I uncontrollably let out a Rick Ross grunt. It was that good. It made the rest of my night difficult, walking around 8 km with a 4 lb burrito brick in my stomach wasn't a smart move, but I regret nothing.

After a long night and waking up at 5PM famished since we didn't eat anything for the rest of the night, we decided to go watch a movie. Trying to tip toe around our collective shame, we agree that Burrito Boyz was 'on the way' and the only 'logical' choice for our 8PM breakfast/lunch/dinner.

The second visit was much more pleasurable. No lineup and the staff was far more relaxed and very friendly. I went for the large chicken breast & steak mix (no extra charge - $8 tax in) and C. got a small veggie soy ($6.75 tax in).

If I didn't have enough art this weekend, watching them carefully constructed my burrito tower was a bit of an art form. Both burritos were filled well and no 'dry' bites (sections with no meat). And this time, the burrito had much more structural integrity - so I ate 2/3 of the burrito and saved the rest for later. Nothing says 'boss' like eating a burrito the size of your forearm in a movie theater.

The beef/chicken burrito I had was also excellent and the steak was really tender and the chicken wasn't dry. Had a few bites of the veggie soy and it wasn't offensive (honestly, the best I can say for most veggie things).

Burrito Boyz is probably the best Tex-Mex 'cheap/fast food' burrito joint I've been to. Yes, it's better than Chipotle. Yes, even better than when I went crazy in east Los Angeles. Being the best Tex-Mex in my book, basically makes this the best 'Mexican' place I've been to (admit it, 'bastardized' Tex-Mex is often better than 'authentic' Mexican - you're just too afraid to say it)."}
{"text":"New Burrito Boyz -- 2 block east of Yonge and Dundas, open from 11AM - 11PM everyday.

Same solid burritos as the other locations, however there is no seating here.  The joint appears to be just for takeout only.  However, glad they opened one that's close to my place and not swarmed with drunken post-clubbing d-bags on Adelaide... just the usual riff-raff around Y&D Square."}
{"text":"First time having a burrito boyz. Quite a small place. Can get really crowded. Not so many spaces to sit so if you are in a large group, better have it as take out and enjoy on the lake. Food was good- the hot sauce was super hot  soo soo good.

Really appreciate the fact that they put a bowl of water near the table for pets to drink. A small gesture goes a long way."}
{"text":"The chicken burritos here are good (For Toronto's standards).  Currently $8 for large.  The equivalent at Burrito Bandidos up the street is $9.50.  Why go to Bandidos when they charge quite a lot more????

 I don't really think I can tell much of a difference between the two joints (although the fish burritos at banditos in my experience have tasted 'less fishy', so I'd go to Bandidos for that... but not for the chicken/steak etc given the big price differential).



Just don't go here after 10 at night on a Fri/Sat night.  Long line ups with the clubbers.

Also be careful going here at lunchtimes on weekdays (~12pm-1pm?).  The line ups can be huge... right to outside the door and up the steps to the street."}
{"text":"Do not order the disgusting inedible tough fatty steak burrito! What a disaster! How can they serve such crap! They should taste it before they serve it. Other burritos are ok."}
{"text":"Great burritos! Generous serving, great service! The movie deal is amazing, Cineplex movie, burrito and pop for $16.42! What a deal, dinner and movie on the cheap!"}
{"text":"Great food but the line is always sooooo long. I guess that's a sign of a good restaurant though :)"}
{"text":"BEST burritos in the city - hands down! A regular lunch go-to. I suggest you order ahead of time that way you can zip in, get your food, pay and go."}
{"text":"Used to be a 4 stars for me but I noticed a decrease in the quality of meat used for the steak burrito, which made it hard for me to decide to go back... which I still do once in a while. I guess if you go after a night out you won't notice that difference as much...

Bonus point: Love that they keep a stack of NOW newspaper... the only place in the city I would check it out while having a burrito."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me. I always order by calling in or pick up in person, they provide great service all the time and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I love Burrito Boyz. I honestly do. When working at Lush on Jutland my coworkers took me there for the first time. Living on Lakeshore I would treat myself once a month to a burrito. Based on the other two locations being so good I thought \"damn! this place is close to my summer home it MUST be just as good!\" No. No it's not. Knowing it's a Thursday night I decided to call in my order, an hour (YES! A WHOLE HOUR) before. So, I arrived and paid on the time I said that I would be in and then I waited. And waited. And waited. And soon the place was filled with more people who were receiving their NEW orders before my called in one. I got my order 25 minutes AFTER the time I called in for my burrito to be ready. Once new people started getting their burritos I went up and asked \"Hey, Ive been waiting here for like, 20ish minutes and I happened to call in over and hour and thirty minutes ago and you haven't called out my number or anything around my number, where is it?\" They then look ip to see my order waiting WHERE ALL THE CALL ORDERS ARE. It was waiting there about twenty minutes the WHOLE time. No one decided to get my burrito when I paid. 
Now heres the thing, I love ordering the fish. Which means it's covered in a light batter. My burrito had been sitting there for about twenty five minutes and it took me another ten to get home so by the time I got home the burrito was soggy as a wet dog in rain and the fish was a bloody mess. I wanted so much to like this place, so much, but while I'm in town I'll be making my own burritos."}
{"text":"Fish burrito takes way longer to make than the other burritos. Delicious nonetheless! Just wish the fish had been distributed more evenly."}
{"text":"Love it!

It is super fresh, open kitchen concept, and they have fish burritos. Found the wait a little long, but I will follow the Yelper's advice about calling in the order ahead of time.

Halibut burrito, spicy, you can't go wrong. 

Oh and the guacamole...is perfect.

Ps. I skipped on the rice to make it a little more carb friendly- and it was JUST as delish!"}
{"text":"Ever feel really hungry! Well Burrito Boyz is the place to go for a delicious meal! Depending on what time you go the wait can be a little long (especially during a lunch rush hour)! I think this is the only place that is open to 4AM on weekends in toronto!

They have a lot of delicious options and if your vegetarian then they have options for you too! They have burritos and quesadillas! I love their Bean and Cheese burrito topped with Everything and Hot sauce for the added Kick!!! The food is excellent and deliciously filling! If you have a small appetite you may need to Share a Small burrito!!

Their prices are great! They average around $6 for a small and $7.10 for a Large Burrito!!

If you are carnivore this would be the place for your Cravings!!!"}
{"text":"My girls and I love going here after a late night at work.

It's our treat yourself type of meal and not feel bad about it after.

I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was cooked to perfection, the wrap had the perfect crunch and filling was nice and warm. I drenched my quesadilla in the sauce and it was to die for. 

The only thing negative about the place is the tables aren't always clean, we would wipe down the tables ourselves before we sit down to enjoy our meal.

As well, I personally find the parking lot is very out of the way to the entrance."}
{"text":"When is a food chain NOT a chain...

With its 28 locations throughout SW Ontario, identical menus at all locations and consistency of its offerings Burrito Boyz fits the description of a fast food chain restaurant. However, in terms of quality and slow custom crafting of each order, the similarities end there. Having been a loyal diner since the sole location emerged in downtown Toronto, which seemed to start our Mexican food awakening in the city, their quality has remained terrifically consistent.

My perennial favour is still their halibut. Despite it being the slowest burrito to come off the flat grill top. My growling belly has learned that patience is worth the wait for excellent homemade calibre quality. 

A few weeks ago I got to introduce a sibling and their spouse to it.  Both were duly impressed. One fellow diner noted that even their side of tortillas isn't the same old bland dish. With their colourful appearance and crispness, the Boyz' warmed iteration rises above most competitors' offerings. 

The Burrito is the main attraction here and can be packed with two types of beans, rice,  cheese, a variety of veggies and topped off with your choice of sauces. Sadly guacamole, a Mexican staple is now .87 cents+ tax extra.  A perfectly toasted tortilla, either white-whole wheat or G.F.,  jam packed with toppings makes for a satisfyingly filling treat. Consider ordering the small on your first visit as the large should really be called humongous and will overwhelm most eaters. 

Their choices of drinks especially the Mexican Jumex juice and nectar line are an excellent choice for a much-needed quaff."}
{"text":"Read the other reviews, spot on. I will be back. Small is the same size as a normal Baja Fresh or Chipolte burrito. Good prices, fresh veggies, excellent flavor!"}
{"text":"This place is in close proximity to our home so every now and then we order from here. 
It's best to do take out here as dine in isn't that good and especially with the crowd coming in, it's difficult to enjoy the food.
We usually order the Burritos only, a small is like $8 and the large is $9 and change.
I usually preorder over the phone, so have to explain properly. Many a times they do not add sauces properly and hence it becomes dry. Like couple times I clearly said no beans but they had still added it!
Taste wise, it's good, but not like their other branch at 410 and Queen, that one is busy but yet always a treat.
All in All, it's a good place!"}
{"text":"Service comes with a smile. Food is well cooked. It does have an Indian flavor to it which makes it a not so Tex mex tasting spot. With that being said, I think it's better than chipotle."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz will never fail me.

Never really thought of myself as a fan of burritos until I gave this place a try. Portions are HUGE, ingredients are fresh and cooked to a T.

TIP: If you want your burrito to taste as if it fell straight from heaven, go after a night out - yeah everything may taste better after you've had a few drinks in you but THIS is the ULTIMATE late night \"snack\"."}
{"text":"If you order a burrito here, you probably won't have room for anything else. Hot sauce is actually hot enough unlike some places."}
{"text":"Burrito is love, burrito is life.
Seriously, best burritos in downtown Toronto, and the best Burrito Boyz shop in Ontario. Very fast and efficient service, reasonable prices (even after the recent increases), and even the small burritos are LOADED (the large is just too much for me!). My co-workers go here basically every day, and I make it a point to go once a week (for basically the last year)."}
{"text":"Okay I waited, so that I could eat at a few more places for benchmarking before I would write this review.  Maybe I have had too high an expectation, or maybe it is the issue of this location, or maybe I am biased, but I find the burrito at this Boyz location rather average.  

I ordered a small steak burrito with mild level of hotness.  The steak strips were of good quality, but the rest was not memorable, in that I honestly didn't remember a thing that stood out.  The lettuce and tomato was not particularly fresh, the refried bean did not taste bold.  

Price wise, it was a good deal for less than $7.  So here you go: A-OK."}
{"text":"Great first impression, knew they name but had never been. Ordered a large steak and shrimp and a large sweet potato and chicken, both were great, well worth the $10 each. Everything was fresh, the meat was well seasoned and they were wrapped perfectly, they didn't fall apart after a few bites like your average corporate burrito chain."}
{"text":"This is the second location I've been to and honestly the burritos and naked burritos are so good! Tbh, they stuff the burrito with so much ingredients that it's so worth it for the price point!

But, the customer service was great. I get it, it's a fast food restaurant.. but when a customer is ordering I kind of recommend listening to them first? 

I ordered a burrito first, I wanted chicken and sweet potato. I said chicken, and the Asian girl quickly jotted that in the register and continued asking what else I wanted with it. Didn't let me finish saying anything else until the very end when I looked at the register and it didn't say MIX. Then she asked if I wanted guac and I asked my boyfriend and he said \"No.\" and then she goes \"ok with guac??????????!\" Very loudly as if I couldn't hear her while she's right in front of me. I loudly said \"NO GUAC\". And she proceeded with doing the order \"all over again\" because well, if you let me finish saying what I needed to say MAYBE you wouldn't have to do the order all over again. 

That's just my only problem. But rest assure I'll still be eating, I'll just watch out for that location even tho it's closer to me."}
{"text":"(Visited during the day) 

I've been to this location more times than I can count, and on a good day it can have one of the best burritos in Toronto. There is ample seating indoors. They are generous with portions and very efficient. 

I used to be a big chipotle fan, but lately their quality has taken a hit and multiple locations have recently become VERY stingy with toppings. Big turn-off. I'm not having a burrito to be healthy. 

Burrito Bandidos is just as good (if not better), but both can be 5 stars. Halibut still reins supreme, recommend holding sour cream and rice. Naked if you hate carbs like I do."}
{"text":"Never thought a burrito would taste sooo good after a night of drinking....but I was wrong. My friend vouched for this place and by looking at the long line that formed outside this small joint, I was sold! After skimming through their menu posted on the wall, I proceeded to place my order with the man behind the corner, (chicken burrito with all the fixin's) one bite, two bites, three...as I continued to enjoy my fat, tasty burrito and went in for my 4th bite, my bf snatched it out of my hands and gobbled it all down...mind you, after he had one of his own. I was totally bummed but nonetheless drunk so I didn't care too much...oh how I wish I got to finish my tasty burrito...but from what I got to eat, it was really delicious! The great thing about this joint is that it's open really late so this is a great place to go after a late night of drinking/dancing."}
{"text":"Coming from a city with such great Mexican food options, I am usually disappointed when I get Mexican in others cities. However, this place rocks. In four days, I ate here twice. First time got the steak burrito, good. Second time got the Chicken burrito. Great!!! That is my recommendation. 

One tip, be careful with the hot sauce, it is extremely hot."}
{"text":"I've been to this late night hot spot for many years! I'm super lucky that it's only a 3 min drive from my house. Burrito Boyz is a staple in Mississauga! I usually get the chicken/steak burrito, I love the side chips and guacamole but my fav is the halibut. You'll never leave this place hungry. They pack the burritos with toppings and never skimp out on the meat. They also have cool daily specials and right now they have a burrito and movie deal which is a great deal! 

P.S. Has anyone ever tried their calamari? I always want to order them but I'm way too afraid bc I'm super picky when it comes to calamari!"}
{"text":"Finally, I had a chance and even with all the hype, Burrito Boyz lived up to its name.  We walked in on a Friday afternoon and this place was packed.  There were people shouting for the next customer in line and shouting for orders that were ready to go.  It was a little overwhelming since we had a baby with us, but we eventually found a seat and settled in.

My husband and I both ordered the halibut burrito, which can be customized to your own liking.  It was honestly, the best fish burrito I've ever had.  The halibut was lightly battered and deep fried.  The batter was still crispy, while the fish was juicy as we bit into our enormous burrito.  Inside my burrito, surrounding the fish were rice, beans, guacamole and lettuce.  The only mistake we made was order a large burrito for my husband because that thing is massive.  I barely finished my small and he only ate about 3/4 of his.  Not only are the portions laughably big, the prices kept us well within budget."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz is so freaking delicious. Go and you shall not be disappointed. Gets 6 stars when you are drunk or high. :D"}
{"text":"A gem in Mississauga!

Small burrito joint, tight for space but provides an A++ product. I've tried almost all their burritos choices  and they all taste amazing and priced very well. They put the perfect amount of ingredients for it not to be messy.

Putting aside the food, it seems like they have many regulars and maintain a close relationship with the public. They were greeted nicely and even knowing their names, it was nice to see. I've also noticed a few people bringing friends who has not tried the food and has high regards for this restaurant.

Speaking of high regards, I will definitely bring myself back to this gem. And to add on, spread the name Burrito Boyz in port credit to all who don't know.

Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"The place to go when you are craving just about anything. Theres meat, carbs, veggies and that hint of spice if you are into that...plus the guac is free! 

I always saw the place completely packed Saturday nights and there was a reason to it. The portions are large despite the price and its a easy meal (cant call it a snack due to its size) to down after an insane night out at a club. The only problem is the lineups!! Other than that just wish the place was more spacious. 

Go for the halibut! But safest bet is to go with the chicken:)
P.S. If you ask for a mix, they give you more!"}
{"text":"Definitely a bomb burrito. Came here for lunch and the small burrito filled me up. 
It's like a chipotle style where you pick your toppings. 
The nachos are good depending how you like them. I probably wouldn't do the salsa on the nachos next time."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good burritos. If you're looking for a lot of food (good quality) I'd recommend burrito boyz. Also: try the shrimp, it's surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"This place is opened recently. Nice location with ample parking in the plaza.
The place is clean... floors, tables, counters are maintained clean.

Staffs are very friendly and welcoming.... great service with a smile.
The menu and food are same standards as all other Burrito Boyz location, but it stands out from many other locations for its nicely decorated, well-lit, spacious interior and great staffs.

Definitely a good place to go with friends and family for a casual meal if you like Mexican foods  :-)"}
{"text":"Tried their famed halibut burrito and it was slightly better than the steak and shrimp I got on my first visit. Could actually taste the fish. 

I still do prefer the seating area here as opposed to the tiny-ness of Fat Bastard and would probably choose it if I was grabbing a meal while I was out as opposed to bringing food home

Service still 100 times faster at Fat Bastard."}
{"text":"Hard to go wrong, cheap, filling, tasty. Who knows how many of these I've had over the past few months."}
{"text":"I go to this location pretty often and it's continuously jammed packed!   The steak burritos are always fresh and tasty, the staff are very friendly, they prepare the food in front of you and you can't beat the prices.  I always get the small burritos because they're most like large and I eat them in two sittings."}
{"text":"My go to place for my texmex cravings. For under $11 I got a huge large naked shrimp bowl. I usually ask for tons of veggies toppings to make it healthier and to get a bang for my buck! Guac is 80c extra which is a bit annoying thought. Good basic Mexican flavours and efficient service. Usually so pick up but they also have some spots for dine in as well."}
{"text":"I've been going to Burrito Boyz with my friend and ordered the Veggie Soy, and you get way more value!!!! Now that they have Gluten Free, I will come here more often!!!"}
{"text":"Originally 5 stars.

However, dropped to 4 stars. 

Justification? Not only did you start to charge for guacamole, as you were one of few if not the only place who did not charge, you started charging extra for extra sour cream or burrito boys sauce today? Really? The avocados are expensive so I can understand that. But an extra line of sour cream or burrito boys sauce? Really? Like, really?"}
{"text":"Their Soy 'meat' is a must try! I would recommend it to people who are meat eaters as well. I always get a burrito bowl and my most recent experience they gave me extra guac which was a great plus. Good if you're craving a burrito, one of the better burrito joints in my opinion. 

Their hot sauce is pretty hot so 1-2 drops will do you just fine. I also like the taste of their vegetables all fresh tasting (raw tomatoes, peppers & lettuce). 

Overall never disappoints and I love that they're always open late at night."}
{"text":"First time eating at Burrito Boyz in December 2016. Walked around the aquarium for 4 hours and was super hungry. When I ordered the Chicken Nachoz, I was sure that I would finish this dish at the eatery. But I had to take it home! Very filling and worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Visited this place yesterday and couldn't get to writing review sooner. 

I visited this place yesterday during the lunch rush which wasn't a smart idea. The place was very busy and there was very little room to move around. When I placed my order the cashier couldn't hear me due to the very loud music and the amount of people chatting. Overall the initial impression made it feel as if I was entering a club opposed to a burrito place.

After ordering and picking my toppings; I received my burrito. 

The burrito was surprisingly well, it had a good amount of flavour (more than I expected) and was big enough to fill me up. I also ordered the combo which came with nachos plus drink and I could barely finish it, something you don't normally get for $10.

This place only has one real drawback which is the loud music that plays in the restaurant; it can really make it difficult when ordering. Other than that the place is pretty alright!"}
{"text":"Fast food Mexican style.

Got a chicken burrito. Guacamole is included as a toping of choice which is good. This place is more of a take out joint. A few bar stools and also a table which seats four people is what they have for seating here. Service was fast and efficient and the food is great for a quick bite of Mexican food."}
{"text":"There was nothing memorable about this place. The service was okay, the flavours were okay, and the prices were okay. But, beware: this place charges extra for having a tortilla on the side for your naked burrito. And, their rice isn't fully cooked. To elaborate, the cashier stressed that the naked burritos are huge and have more fillings, which is why Burrito Boyz charges for a tortilla on the side. She kept pushing me to keep the tortilla on my bill. Unfortunately, I didn't find the naked burritos to be any bigger. I also found a lot of uncooked rice in my meal, and that took me (and my teeth) by surprise. I wouldn't recommend ordering at this location."}
{"text":"Tried a new item this time & that was the calamari quesadilla ($9.65). It was good, but honestly I feel like this time around it tasted less fresh & more oily. The burrito sauce wasn't that great because it only added to the spicy/oily flavour in the vegetable portion. The salsa was really refreshing though & would recommend asking for two of the salsas. It was better than the calamari burrito though, as the calamari was cut into smaller pieces and more spread out in the quesadilla!"}
{"text":"A favorite lunch spot.  Best burritos downtown, no question.  Send visitors here all the time and they always love it."}
{"text":"Fresh Burritos on a late night, oh yeah! 

The burritos here are huge, and you will surely get full if you eat one. They have chicken, steak, halibut and shrimp burritos, size small and large. The small is pretty big to be small (that's what she said) lol. If you weren't feeling for a burrito, they also have quesadillas too! Iv tried them and they're good. Mucho good.  

The place is kinda small so it might get packed sometimes with a line-up. Especially if it's a late night on the weekend. Don't expect much seating in here either."}
{"text":"I'm giving this location 4 stars because the burritos taste better than the ones in Mississauga, & there's More seating available here. It's basically located underneath Smoke's (Shout-out), you have walk downstairs to get inside. 

Coming here on a weekend around 12am, you'll find it gets packed with drunk d-bags coming from the bars that are about a minute away from here. Btw may I add that I was walking here passing by & the one of their security guards grabbed my hand as if I knew them! No thanks 45 year old bouncer!!! 

Coming here I thought I haven't had their burritos in a while, So I got their large half shrimp half steak. I didn't know you could do that until one of their staff suggested it to me. After the 6-7 min. wait I took my first bite, it was soo loaded with everything It just hit the spot. Then I got the to the shrimp part...they were huge!!! Almost like prawns! 

My craving was satisfied, I find their burritos so filling. I was taken back a little bit. I shall be back!"}
{"text":"Coming here at 2am was a bad idea. I think it took my body a whole day to digest my burrito madness. 

I can't really say this location is my Fave, but it's smaller then the rest. Meaning it gets packed, even more then the other burrito boyz. I didn't even know that was possible, I think I saw about half of b-towns population here. My thing now is to order is half steak and half shrimp. And Iv also gotten the shrimp quesadillas before too, Deliciousssssss. Shrimp is the way to go. The workers here are really nice but expect to wait a while for your Order because most likely it will be busy as hell. Duh! Should've known that by now. 

Also watch your step when you walk in, or else you will surely trip. That would be funny for someone else to watch."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Recently stayed a week in the neighborhood and ate here three times. Definitely appreciate the ultra late hours on the weekend. You order your basic item, burrito, quesadilla, naked burrito, etc and then head to the fixin station to personalize it while it's being made. All the ingredients were fresh; cilantro, corn, jalapeno, salsas...even late night when people are too drunk to notice/care, you will see them refreshing the toppings. Portions are definitely worth the price, especially the naked burrito. They grill the tortillas after the burrito is wrapped as opposed to steaming them before, but it works. Takes a little longer, but it works. Courteous staff. Parking is almost non existent at this location, especially during the day. Would eat here once a week if I could."}
{"text":"Simply the best burritos I've ever had. I've been to several locations and it's always amazing. love love love."}
{"text":"A Toronto local recommended Burrito Boyz to me. I stumbled upon this location by accident. But I was glad I did. I was so hungry and I heard their burrito is the size of a brick. You know what, people are not exaggerating. I got the chicken burrito with everything. It was big and filling. When you first walk in, you need to got to the register first to order. That part confused me. I'm so used to places like Chipotle where they make your burrito first then you pay. But here, you tell the person behind the register what you want in terms of burrito, quesadilla, etc, and what meat you want. You pay. The pricing is based on how big you want your burrito. They weigh the burrito. Then walk over to the food station to tell them what toppings you want. After that, you wait about 5 minutes while they grill your order. They have lots of different toppings to chose from. The burrito is good and worth the price. I didn't get their chips and salsa. It looked good from where I was sitting."}
{"text":"Great late night service on a wednesday! Two girls making the food were extremely polite and courteous, hard to find in this area. They treated me, the last guest in the building, like the first guest of the day. Kudos!!!"}
{"text":"Being a California Gurl (we're unforgettable), it's quite hard to appreciate Mexican food anywhere other than where I grew up, San Jose, CA! BUT, with that said, I think I'm going to have to agree that Burrito Boyz are gonna be on my Fav 5 places to eat in Toronto. Whether you pick up take out and eat at Lake Ontario with the fam bam, or come hungry for a midnight snack, a veggie burrito with everything made HOT surely hits the spot!!! Fresh ingredients, spicy hot sauce, and the tortilla made golden brown to the perfect crisp with green jalepenos and melted cheese. Yum-EH! (HAHA get it?)"}
{"text":"Delicious Filling Burritos on a Student Budget.

This is my preferred drunk food. I always go for the chicken until recently, but the Haddock was amazing. I will try the halibut when I'm feeling adventurous. 

Be warned, the hot sauce is ACTUALLY HOT, so don't try to be macho here.
Near campus, and you can call ahead. Perfect campus dinner."}
{"text":"Good high quality food, for relatively good pricing. One massive plus was that it was celiac friendly where they did ensure that the food was safe to eat."}
{"text":"Burritos here are amazing! Costs around $6 on average for a burrito and I can barely get through half because their so filling. Great Value for money and the service is really fast and efficient! Just a heads up, their hot sauce is DYNAMITE hot! so beware!"}
{"text":"Prices went up. Ordered a small halibut after tax it came up to $11.52. Kinda expensive for a take out place and no drink. The girl at front are efficient. They took my order put the ingredients on but the guys heating up the burrito took forever and there was no line. I was the only person there. She left my unwrapped burrito on the wrap while he continued to chop his onions when he should stop and grill my burrito instead... next time I'm gonna come back 3-5 on a Thursday since they have buy one get one half off."}
{"text":"There's no reason to go here.

Why would you drop $10 on a fast food burrito when you're surrounded by a plethora of BETTER, CHEAPER and TASTIER options?

This place isn't even the best burrito place on this block.

Sure,  I had a hunch before I walked in here that this would be the case... but I was drawn in by the faux-graffiti sign and the fact that it had just opened this location.

Bland food.  Canadiana Fast food aesthetic.  No Interac.  Vomit slurpie."}
{"text":"We ended up waiting to eat dinner till late but fortunately this place was open! It's a spin off chipotle. The burritos are warmed (toasted) which is great and they use actual Mexican refried beans. Was not a fan of the chips and salsa, but I also come from Texas where I'd say is the best chips and salsa around!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious half halibut, half shrimp naked burrito today. It was a huge, delicious and filling lunch. I love all the toppings to choose from to create a semi-healthy lunch. Quick too."}
{"text":"I used to like Burrito Boyz at this location until today.

I have no problem with the food, but rather the customer service. This location used to be great - filled with energetic staff members and always looking and asking people waiting for food. That's not what happened today.

I ordered on the online app for the large naked chicken at 1:22pm for pickup at 1:35pm. I went there right at 1:35pm and the staffs were saying that the order was almost ready. There were 3-4 customers before me so I waited. I started suspecting something when those customers left and the staffs started talking to each other and filing up the ingredients... That was around 1:40pm. I still waited, thinking that they probably would've called me or asked me by now, but no - I was standing right in front of them while they were just joking around.

When I asked for the online order at 1:45pm, the black girl apologized as she completely forgot about it. I understand that this could happen if no one was waiting right in front of them for the order but let me stress again - I was standing right in front of them. Sure, I was using my cell phone, but any service employee who actually cares would've asked. When she gave the container to a white boy, he looked at me with his allegedly stoned face and asked \"is this yours?\" I could've been a d*ck and said \"yea buddy no sh*t it's mine. didn't you see me waiting here all by myself for the last 10 minutes right in front of you?\" but I'd rather be nice in front of them since I didn't want to be confrontational.

Bottom line: You know what you're getting here. It's a fast food restaurant. You're not gonna get any top notch burritos here. They used to make good ones, now it's probably worse than Subway. I used to prefer this to Subway because they used to have nicer staff and decent burritos. Now the word decent is not going to cut it anymore. Customer service as bad (or worse) than Subway. The only redeeming quality is quantity...

I would like to love this location as I used to, but I don't think that can be the case anymore."}
{"text":"It's not quite three stars.  Not quite. The description for a two star joint is as such: \"Meh.  I've experienced better\".  

Now, I know that we're all a little tired of \"meh\", an exclamation that seems born of the same weakness and lack of conviction as the \"fail\" meme.  But Burrito Boyz seems to have earned itself a \"meh\". 

The ingredients seem okay, although the salsas are not quite up to snuff.  The final preparation of grilling the burrito adds an interesting element, a bit of external crispness to the tortilla ,but I can't help but feel that sometimes they are a bit overcooked. 

And does the world benefit from warm lettuce?  More importantly, does the burrito? 

I go to this one mostly because it's convenient.  I think I might need to reconsider that."}
{"text":"Vegans and vegetarians can easily eat here (mostly takeout), the two main burrito options are sweet potato or veggie soy with 10 at least different toppings to choose from, also two kinds of quesadillas, also sweet potato or veggie soy with lots of toppings.  Great prices and 3 different sizes to choose from, the small is pretty large IMHO :)
Don't forget to try their hot sauce, it's strong and very flavourful, perfect on any burrito.
I love this location's customer service, everyone is super nice and of'course the fact that I can call ahead to order my burrito before picking it up, saves a lot of time."}
{"text":"One of the best burrito chains in the city. I loved the downtown location and was so glad that they had opened one in North York too! 

It takes a few minutes to make the burrito, but it doesn't get as busy as the downtown location. For about $9, you get a large chicken or steak burrito that will definitely fill you up!

The atmosphere is very casual. The staff are primarily young adults, kind of hipster-style. It's primarily a takeout place, but there are a few seats and tables. A lot of standing room though, probably because it takes a while to make the burritos (5 minutes maybe?). I wish they would give more guacamole in the burrito. Unfortunately, they were pretty stingy when they made mine!

All in all, I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"For sure, the best burrito at the best price in the city. Consistent, reliable, the right amount of stuffings, and since I've been frequenting this Adelaide location I have always left smiling. The staff are really nice. AND I just learned today they have vegan guacamole. You have to request it, but the regular one has some sour cream in it. I've tried other burritos - johnny banana, banditos, freshii - and don't even come close."}
{"text":"Fast food burritos at its best here. Portions are incredible, toppings are always fresh and tasty.

Yes, service can be a bit slow as they are a made to order restaurant and then the burritos are grilled for about 5 minutes. I'd rather my burrito freshly made and grilled as opposed to sitting there so no complaints on wait time. Order the naked burrito and they come super speedy."}
{"text":"I normally love burrito boyz. But this location is slow for the amount of workers they have and the space they have. Waited nearly 15 minutes just for my burrito to be grilled. They don't offer to make it combo and this day they only took cash as their electronic  payment machines were down. Disappointed by this location. Burrito was okay....."}
{"text":"Best place to get burritos in Mississauga. Nothing comes close. The environment is nice and subtle. All the staff is very nice and easy to have a conversation with. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"For what is, this place does a good job. It's nothing fancy. The quality of food is okay. Prices are not bad, large burrito for 9$. Great for late night eats."}
{"text":"Was picking up my lil sis from Brampton and got hungry. This showed up on my list, so I had to try it.

It was a little packed for a Saturday night but service was quick. I got my shrimp quesadilla not long after ordering. The reviews are right. If you are in the mood for some good Mexican food, come to Burrito Boyz. I would definitely order this again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I guess it was okay.  I'd call it grub.  The take out box had sharp corners and the workers failed to seal it properly."}
{"text":"It is a very difficult thing, to stand on this part of the Queensway, where two well-known local chains almost but not quite face each other, and not immediately start to make comparisons between the two. Many of the other reviews do exactly that, and it may be a useful exercise for those who may have eaten one or the other before.

But I think that they are more or less two sides of the same coin -- neither of them is going to ever fully compare to the sweet memories of local burrito shops in my home area, San Francisco, the birthplace of these style of burritos. 

So, I'd like to judge this place on its own merits, and pretend that it is alone on the street.

Firstly, parking is a nightmare here. It shares a miniscule parking lot with a number of other busy businesses, and we opted to not bother, since I was in my behemothmobile. There's a shopping center parking lot a short walk away, and that made things a lot easier.

This is another style of burrito place where you pick your meats and fillings in advance, and then they toast the thing up on a hot grill before handing it out to you. This can create a little bit of a bottleneck as people wait in the ordering area for their orders. I grabbed a table while Lee waited for our food.

I like that they have a nice combo deal, where for slightly more than a price of a drink you get some chips and salsa thrown in. 

The dining area is pretty spacious for a place like this, and I really appreciated that. It's decorated with the numerous awards that the chain has won since opening. 

As for the burrito? It was great. I got a shrimp burrito with no rice and a lot of the extra spicy additions. It was mouth searingly delicious.

I'd definitely head back for a return visit!"}
{"text":"Overall the food tastes great the staff are quite friendly. The only gripe I have with this location is the lack of reliability when it comes to ordering for take out. By lack of reliability I'm referring to the fact that many times, despite ordering 15-20 min before arrival the food ordered still won't be ready. A part of the reason for this is due to the large in flow of customers. This is a busy location. My recommendation is to order 25-30 min in advance. If you don't, you'll probably have to wait for your pick up when you arrive. Other than that foods great, staffs awesome, and there is sufficient seating."}
{"text":"Key Features: A burrito so full of delicious stuff that lifting it up to eat can be considered a form of exercise.

The hardest part about getting to Burrito Boyz is making the choice to go down the stairs, instead up up to Smokes Poutine.  In the early days, Smokes always won.  Now, I'll take any excuse for Burrito Boyz.

They create their meals as if it were a work of art.  Nothing out of place, everything where it should be.  Each bite as good as the one before.   And the large?  You're looking at some real heft.  I always want to have two, but I've barely been able to finish just the one.

It's the burrito to which all other burritos should be compared.  

Protip: call and order in advance, as you're walking towards Burrito Boyz.  When you get there, you'll skip the line, and make everyone else jealous of your brilliance."}
{"text":"When you find your wife in stages of early labour, this place is the perfect distance from St. Joes to walk to.  

Not only does it provide a delicious and filing meal at a price that is unbeatable across the entire city, but that walk allows the oxytocin to flow freely preventing the labour from stopping.

Next time I'm hours away from having a new baby, you better believe I'll be back here for another large steak burrito with everything on it.

Heck, the medical professionals recommended this joint.  What else do you need?!

---[when cost matters]---
Large steak 8.63
Small steak 7.52
Orange juice 2.00"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Burrito Boyz franchise Location out of the other ones, I have always had a good and filling burrito here. I usually get the Shrimp burrito and it has always been mouth watering good!"}
{"text":"After visiting the so called competition up the street I can see why Burrito Boyz has multiple locations.  Mixed beef/chicken with mild sauce on whole wheat FTMFW!  Nuff said!"}
{"text":"Ahh a welcomed addition to Parkdale/Roncesvalles neighborhood. Just like it's other locations it doesn't disappoint. Fresh ingredients and it caters to vegetarians, meatarians, and those with gluten intolerance. Vegans enter at your own risk but it's worth it I promise you! (Chicken, Beef, Halibut, Pollock, Veggie Soy, Sweet potato...equals YUM)

Just like its other locations, you place your order, wait for your number to be called, indicate your toppings/fillings (naked burrito/burrito/quesdilla) and wait with hungry anticipation for your final personalized delicious concoction.  As always like the other locations you can also call ahead for big orders!"}
{"text":"How can I not love Burrito Boyz?

It's fast (sort of) and filling (unless you're a bottomless pit like myself) and always has plenty of space to sit (unless you're there during meal times!)

More importantly, what can I say about them that other's haven't covered?  Not much.

I love the tasty tasty steak with everything except salsa.  I've found the salsa just makes it a bit too wet for my taste.  (It's good with the salsa too, but I find the only thing I miss when I don't get it is the mess on my hands.)

They are by no means the best burritos on earth, nor are they all that authentic in any way shape or form.  (Ok ok... you got me on the shape/form)  But they are delicious if you can get your schnozz out of your authentic/purist first-class altitude and just eat it for what it is:  a savoury, hot, melty, crunchy, messy tube of warm deliciousness.

Strangely enough, I've never strayed far from my the burritos.  I've had the halibut, the chicken and the steak.  They all put yum into my tum."}
{"text":"Nothing really our of the ordinary here as I was not super impressed with the quality of the food but the service was absoutely incredible. Knowledgable staff made the somewhat complicated experience of customizing the burrito a lot easier.

Decent price I would say but again i was not all that impressed by the burrito itself"}
{"text":"This place is really popular during lunch, although kind of overpriced. It's located on the basement level of a rundown-looking building. Their burritos are naturally spicey I think.. so if you don't like that it's best if you told them to lessen the spiciness before you burn your mouth.

They actually take a long time to make these things for some reason (I don't go enough to understand the process). Sometimes there are long lineups, too. 

I don't believe there is a lot of seating, so that's why you might see people sitting in the bench outside of the place eating burritos.

Overall a great place to grab lunch during work :)"}
{"text":"Staff are friendly and the service is fast!

This location is definitely one of the better options in Scarborough. 

It's a little frustrating how little guac they give you especially when you pay extra for it."}
{"text":"Poor quality and service on July 22, 2016.
In general, I have stopped ordering Chicken burritos because I find the meat quality to be decreasing (it has become much too dry and is clearly all dark meat). Today I ordered a bean & cheese burrito, and the overall quality was below average. When I unwrapped the burrito it flopped over showing that it was not wrapped tightly enough. Inside the burrito, it was a sea of liquid which created a very unenjoyable experience. Lastly, the server assembling the burrito did not create an even arrangement of vegetables, because when I bit into it, all you can taste was beans and soggy lettuce. She was also not truly paying attention as when my friend asked for mild, she gave him 3 squeezes of hotsauce and when I asked for medium, I received one. Definitely will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Ok.  I visited this place after Fat Bastards Burrito across the street from this location.....can I just say night and day!  The burritos here were nicely grilled and fresh tasting.  The place was clean and busy.  No employees eating over the prep station like at Fat Bastards.  And the employees seemed to care.  Overall a good experience.  Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"This place and all burrito boyz have the best burritos in all of GTA, i feel like its the way they grill the burrito that sets it apart from all other burrito places. I've tried 10 other burrito places all across GTA nothing compares to these guys. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Amazing as always, this Burrito Boyz location is a lot smaller than the one in Vaughan.

The service was a little slow (waited in line for 5 minutes to order..then another 10 to get our food) as there were tons of people and only three staff. I feel like the Vaughan location puts more ingredients in their burritos.. but the flavours are consistent."}
{"text":"The best burrito I had in a long while!

I came in at around 11:30 AM and the lunch crowd has started to accumulate. The cashier was taking orders fast but there was a small line of customers waiting for their food to come out. The reason became clear in a minute: There was a large catering order they were filling. The burritos were coming off the stove in a rapid fire fashion but were all going into a large catering box.

That discovery brought up a worry that I'd be stuck in this joint a while and may be late to my next meeting. I have to give it to these guys: That large catering order only slowed down them a little bit. My wait was only a few short minutes. And the burrito I got was absolutely worth it.

The menu features a number of burritos and casadillas. I could overhear five or six customers place their orders, and not one of them wanted a casadilla. 

Among all the more-or-less usual choices of meats, The Boyz also offer two varieties of fish (halibut and haddock) and shrimp. That is a huge reason to come here instead of Mucho Burrito (one \"fish\" choice of unknown breed) or Chipotle (no fish of any kind at all).

I went for a large halibut, which was the most expensive one they had on the menu. It came out to about $11 with tax (just over $9.70 pre-tax). Since their kitchen is not equipped with kitchen monitors, the cashier yells out the order so that the cooks would know what to throw on the stove. The \"LARGE HALI!\" cry was heard a lot and the kitchen was hustling and bustling with activity. Obviously, halibut is one of the faves her, and deservedly so. 

Once they wrap your burrito, they bake it until the tortilla becomes crispy and brown in colour on the outside. In the process, the cheese on the inside melts makes the inside gooey and super yummy. This is another improvement over the panini-type grill press they use at Mucho. 

I snapped a picture of all the foodie awards these guys have received. Several dozen of them. And having been there and tried their product, it's not just PR.

The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because of the gym music coming out of the speakers hung from the ceiling. This is something I find a bit hard to stomach but I imaging some of the younger and hipper torontonians may actually find it pleasant.

I'm certainly coming back for another burrito. The haddock costs a buck less and I expect it to be as good. We'll see."}
{"text":"This is my go to local Burrito Boyz.  Owner and his ever changing staff are friendly.

Place is always clean, and food fresh.  Consistently busy, but what Burrito Boyz is not.

Hurry up and go get a Burrito."}
{"text":"Small place, but good food. Many choice. It was my first time finding this place in downtown core. Good price and tasty food, if you like spicy! Worth checking out, even if you are not a fan of burrito."}
{"text":"Their steak burrito, with everything, is pure heavenly awesomeness. The belly is tre-happy. I am also a big fan of their veggie casadias with the burrito dip. YUM!

WARNING: The small burrito is large, the large burrito is gigantos. 

My least favourite thing on the menu is the chicken burrito. Typically, I am a big fan of chicken, and I frequently take chicken over steak, but not here. I found that the chicken just does not go well with their spices. If you do not want to go with steak, I recommend the bean & cheese option.

P.S. I have no idea how this slipped my mind, but the halibut burrito is definitely a worthy opponent to the steak."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. This is one of my first stops here in toronto and it served the city well.  I'm not a huge burrito fan, but this place pretty much won me over and that says a lot.

Service is okay, the cashier was indifferent and non-chalant. Quiet Sunday? Beats me.  I ordered the steak burrito and absolutely loved the chewy texture of the steak.  

Will probably try out the halibut burrito next."}
{"text":"Been a regular customer for several years. Always going at the most random items, and always getting a good meal. 

All the locations for the most part provide the same consistency in terms of taste, quality, and portion sizes. Adelaide and Warden are the best in my opinion. Noticed Kennedy Road location to be a bit skimpy. 

The toppings are always fresh and crisp. With a large variety allowing you to make a perfect combination that suits you. I usually get everything but lettuce, with at least 2 lines of the hot sauce. I find the hot sauce reasonable but this is highly subjective, would advise to try a sample first **. The naked bowls are a great option you get a really large portion. I recommend asking the staff to layer the toppings.  

Chicken - Always tastes great. Well seasoned. My friends mix it with steak and they love it. 

Bean & Cheese - Great vegetarian option. From my experiences the beans always taste fresh, never old with that hard consistency 

Veggie Soy - Wouldn't really recommend unless you really really like soy. Has a weird gritty texture. Side note almost all the soy on this side of the world is GMO :-) ... 

Haddock - You get that nice golden battered crust always flakes apart when you bite/cut through. Would recommend asking for some lime to drizzle on top, goes well with the fish. 

Halibut - Same as the Haddock, would recommend getting the lime. 

Calamari - Tried it once, deep fried with a heavy batter. You dont really get much. 

5/5 for the price, convenience, and taste. Its as good as it gets. No fancy list of flavors just straight simple good food. Would recommend.

Friday/Saturday open till 4am :-) What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"We were in the area so this was our post Saturday night food choice.  I can't believe I've never tried Burrito Boyz.


Chicken Breast - Small 5.97 Large 7.08
Sir Loin Steak -  Small 5.97 Large 7.08
Veggie Soy - Small 5.97 Large7.08
Sweet Potato -  Small 4.87 Large 6.19

Tiger Shrimp - Small 7.08 Large 7.96
Haddock -  Small 7.52 Large 8.41
Halibut - Small  8.85 Large 9.73

You order, pay, choose your toppings and wait until they call for your number. Luckily, we arrived just before the midnight rush and waited for about 10 minutes. I've been told it can take a lot longer. I had their famous small halibut burrito on a whole wheat wrap with all of the fixings minus beans. I opted for their XXX Homemade Hot Sauce and salsa on the side ... oh dear, luckily for me it was on the side because it had tons of heat. My lips were burning but I couldn't stop.  The halibut was incredibly tender, flaky and juicy. SO good and filling but I was only able to finish 2/3 of my burrito and subsequently after my date finished his large halibut, he inhaled the rest of mine.

Fresh, cheap and great size. I will return and as suggested by many Yelpers, I will try the halibut and shrimp mix. If you enjoy Tex-Mex, you will love Burrito Boyz. This place is simply amazing but do keep in mind that line-ups and waiting time can be long.


Vegan/Vegetarian options - Veggie Soy Burrito, Refried Pinto Beans, Mexican Rice
Drinks - Try the Mambo Guava, it's bomb and only $1.50
Business Hours - Open daily at 11:00 am. Monday/Tuesday/Sunday - 11:00 pm, Wednesday - 12:00 am, Thursday - 3:00 am and Friday/Saturday - 4:00 am"}
{"text":"Used to be amazing... Last few visits the quality has been severely lacking. Not sure if its because they are so busy? Changed from steak slices to ground beef, choice of toppings the same but not so fresh. Ad super long lineups.  Will be going up the street to Chorizo instead.  Hope BB finds its way back to where it was.  Would have given 5 stars in the day."}
{"text":"The burritos here are HUGE. Had I not been a little buzzed, I probably would not have been able to finish the whole thing. I had the chicken burrito which was pretty darn good, especially at the price they charge! I would pick this place over chipotle any day. I would come here once a week if there was on in NY!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was good. 

However the place is staffed by young rude people. They got my order wrong and when I said what I really wanted, I was told by the young girl \"No you ordered a large ...\". No sorry. No we will fix that. Just indicating I was wrong. Not one \"welcome\", \"thank you\", \"enjoy\", smile in the place.

Life is too short to give my money to places that can't train the staff that the Customers are important, not an inconvenience in their day.

Bye Burrito Boyz..."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst burrito boyz ever. I love Burrito Boyz and Ive tried tons and across the board they're all pretty good nothing major to complain about from anyone besides this one. 

I got a bowl burrito and I dont put much in my burrito. I dont even get beans I asked them to put more rice which I always do and every other location does it no problem because I really dont get much else. She put not even a full spoon of rice. I asked for more she put maybe a table spoon more. 

I have never had so little food in my burrito. Normally I can't finish my naked burrito but this time I finished it and a bag of chips. This is the worst naked burrito I've had. They were so cheap on th entire thing there was that much chicken and I PAID for extra chicken. Is wasn't even as filling as a naked burrito from other locations without the extra chicken.

Do not go to this location. They make the food like theres a shortage."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times. If you can't tell from my past reviews I go to a lot of burrito boyz, its my go to food if I'm somewhere and dont know what to eat, most times and most locations are great bang for your buck. 

This location is super easy to miss when walking, I've missed it a few times. I always get the same thing, a large chicken burrito and every time it's been great. The staff here is friendly and not skimpy on the burrito filling. 

Its a great cheap eat downtown which is hard to find sometimes especially when right in the core of the city. Open late so its an option after long night in the city. I recommend it just like I recommend any burrito boyz besides streetsville."}
{"text":"I love burrito boyz, and I used to love this location my favourite was always the one on Stavebank but this one was a close second, but I've noticed it going downhill quickly and it's quickly become my least favourite.

Flavour wise all the burrito boyz are the same the only different I find is the amount you get and the preparation. Well this location NEVER seems to cut the green peppers properly and I'm not speaking from one experience I'm speaking from 3!

The last 3 times I've come here I've had a quarter of a bell pepper sliced into my food! Seriously pieces cut 2-3 inches wide and long! This is not how you cut peppers and THIS IS THE ONLY LOCATION I've ever had this problem at! The one at 10 and Steele's is always perfect as well as the one on Stavebank.

This is now one of the worst burrito boyz but on the plus side the one on 10 and Steele's has really stepped up their game and became my second favourite location"}
{"text":"Best burrito boyz location besides for the port credit location. I always order the large chicken naked burrito and they always overfill it like crazy which is great! they give you your moneys worth! So much better than the Streetsville location. 

They staff is super friendly and fast. The food always tastes fresh and you never get that gross bottom of the pot burned rice which yo get at some the burrito joints. I've been to this location three times now and I'm be back if I'm in the area and craving a burrito.Its a great addition to this busy complex which has a lot of other good food places."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed the Burrito Boyz on Stavebank yet! I've been coming for here for years since they opened up! Which means I've been coming here since I was 7... 

This is the best burrito boyz location hands down other locations are no where near as good and some (I'm talking to you streetsville) are just plain horrible. This burrito boyz is what made me like burritos when I was 7 and an extremely picky eater. This was my first taste of Tex-mex style food!

I haven't been to my original location in a while as it's probably the most inconvenient and busy but I swear next time I was burrito boyz I'll drive the extra distance and come here because no other location can compare!!! 

The burrito was huge and packed and it was loaded with meat this large burrito with NO extra meat had the same amount of meat I get when I ask for DOUBLE meat at other locations! They're always nice on the phone when I call ahead to order my burrito and honestly I can't say enough good things about them everything's super fresh and doesn't sit around long because this locations so busy! 

If you call and place an order you're order will be ready on the time frame they give you! Lots of take out places say 15 minutes but then you wind up waiting closer to 25 but not this location!

I'll stop raving now!"}
{"text":"Last week, I had the naked bowl with the sweet potato with most of the options and opted for the large so I would have dinner leftovers. It was a generous portion with huge pieces of sweet potato cooked just right. I did have leftovers which hubby finished up. The beans, Mexican rice and guac were enjoyable and I will definitely be coming back. Service on a weekday just before noon was quick as we were the only customers there."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good. I was a big fan when they just had their location on Peter st, and before the owners split ways and their two locations. The last time I was there though, the burrito was a complete mess and not enjoyable. Also, they kept calling out to people that they had pre-made small chicken and steak burritos if you didn't want to wait. Um, I'd like to wait for good food and not slop thanks. I think this is a good indication that they are just trying to crank food out these days, and it's not as good as it once was. Or maybe my taste buds have just gotten a little better. You can still get a huge burritio there for a reasonable price, so that is a plus. And having a piece of fried fish in your burrito is fun too.

I'd recommend grabbing a poutine from Smoke's above Burrito Boyz instead."}
{"text":"The Best Burritos, hands down.
I STRONGLY recommend the Steak & Shrimp."}
{"text":"Firstly, a burrito cannot be 'naked' because without a shell we are talking either a salad or a mixed meat dish.
With that out of the way, I was not too impressed with my $8 small Halibut Burrito for several reasons.
First, it just plain was not tasty. The preponderance of beans took over and overwhelmed any other taste. Here one gets to pick the sauces and ingredients of course.
Second, the order took way too long. Indeed, they were busy and I get it, but 20 minutes for a sandwich is extreme.
Third, the masses had huddled in front of the cash and counter and it was slightly chaotic. They need to institute a system.
Finally, the dining area was not spic and span likes a food eating area must be. One absolutely cannot eat somewhere that is not immaculate. Clean up!
The very ghetto-like tattooed and cap' n nose ring wearin' staff were friendly though.."}
{"text":"On my vacation to Toronto we ended up eating here twice. When we first got in it was late and we wanted something to eat and Burrito Boyz had high ratings. The first night the gal seemed annoyed to help out some \"newbies\" cause they were busy, but they were still nice. The food was amazing. We got back to the condo and started eating and man, we savored every bite. We ended up going back two days later for lunch cause it was so good. I highly recommend them. Oh yeah, they have more than one location too. What a great place!"}
{"text":"I'm mixed about Burrito Boyz.  Only 3*s as I feel that the wait is incredibly long...especially the last step where they're grilling your burrito on the flat-top.

There was only 1-2 people ahead of me, during an off-time (well after the dinner rush), and I literally waited 15mins+ for 1 burrito.  Staff were friendly and explained they were making the fish (haddock) fresh for me, but a coupla days ago, I went out for fish & chips which literally arrived to my table in 5-8mins, so why is it taking so.loooong??

Redeeming qualities include:
1.  Portion size - Small is sufficient size, lots ingredients
2.  Guac is FREE

Aside from that, it does take long, so keep that in mind.  You may want to call ahead of time to see if that's any quicker!"}
{"text":"I found burrito god. Chipotle will be my #1 for bowls, but burrito wise, Burrito Boyz has Chipotle beat. I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, on the persistence of my friend who practically had to drag me to Burrito Boyz, convinced that Burrito Boyz would be the best thing I've ever tasted. She was wrong. I still love pizza better, but Burrito Boyz has carved a special place in my heart. I ordered a Small Steak Burrito for $7.52. Since it was between 11am-5pm, I used the Student Deal to get a free can of pop. I asked for Nestea but the cashier sternly said \"Nestea is not pop,\" so I got free coke instead...

I didn't experience the friendliest service here, but it wasn't the worst either. After I paid, I waited about 3 minutes before they called me over to ask which toppings I'd like in my burrito. I got refried beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, tomato, green pepper, corn, mild salsa, and burrito sauce. I then took a seat and I was WOW'd. The toasted tortilla brought a surprisingly pleasant texture and taste to the burrito and all its contents. Who would have thought? Anyway, I don't think I can ever have burritos anywhere else ever again."}
{"text":"This location is poppin'.

Semi-busy, huge dining area that puts other Burrito Boyz to shame, and the same excellent burrito you'll get at any other Burrito Boyz. I completely missed the specials sign that I think they should put next to the actual menu rather than the outdoor sign! I only noticed that on my way out; I believe it was buy one, get one half off Quesadilla during certain times for certain days of the week. 

Staff was friendly and made my small (filling) steak burrito in a timely manner. I put all the toppings on, except for the spicy stuff. Napkins and utensils are attached to some seat fixtures/dining separators. They also have a recycling box that people throw garbage in. That hurts my soul. Washrooms make efficient use of space, and were also clean. 

Note: Yelp's pictures for the exterior are outdated, so don't be surprised if you come across the location and it looks nothing like what is on Yelp. Google map the yellow dude it if you're curious as to how it looks now."}
{"text":"NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN.

ive never rated a place in my life but this is my first time, and thats because i was disgusted by the customer service i recieved at this store. 

I love burrito boys......as a food chain their food is very good. But this one location SUCKS. 

I have came here twice and both times i have had a bad experience. The first time i visited this location i arrived in at 2:50am right before closing, so there were alot of people. Okay. So first the lady told the line they had ran out of rice.....okay no problem ill take my burrito without rice. Then at 2:55 they announce that they are out of tortillas....??? They are just giving naked burritos... so okay whatever disappointing but im already there so ill wait. People start to complain and i do understand it is a small location with not alot of people so they are doing what they can but the way they were treating the customers was disrespectful. At 3:00 when its my turn in line the lady says they will not be taking any more orders. I explained to her that i had been waiting since before the store closed and that i had to change my order. She told me that the stove is off so they wont make anything. I told them it was rediculous and I would give them a bad review on both Google maps and Yelp. She smirked and the staff did not seem too concerned so I went on my way. THE SECOND TIME I came to this location was during the day, and I had ordered a steak burrito and I did not even get the correct order I got a chicken burrito which had none of my toppings and I didn't even realize until I had gotten home. I love burrito boys but this location is just incompetent."}
{"text":"There's a Burrito Boyz on Adelaide which are the best in my opinion.  I've ordered from there time and time again.  My big mistake was coming here.  I ordered a veggie soy quesadilla and I've never had anything more disappointing.  The music was too loud and the lady making my order was too soft spoken and probably distracted because who can argue with Bruno Mars? I asked her for NO ONIONS in my quesadilla.  Guess what she does? Yep, exactly the opposite.

I asked for sauce and she asked what kind.  I asked what my choices were and she said mild, medium and hot.  Mild is $5, Medium is $7 and Hot is $10.  HUH??? At least that's what I heard...THREE TIMES.  I just said Medium.  Did she put medium hot sauce? No.  I felt like I was eating hospital food.  She asked if Jalapenos were okay and I said yes and...yep...she forgot to put jalapenos in there.  And then began the long and drawn out waiting process for the beast to cook.  Usually the wrap is hefty and enough to hold the stuff inside together...NOT THIS TIME.  NO.  Everything just fell apart when I picked it up or bit into it.  NEVER AGAIN! NEVER EVER EVER!"}
{"text":"my favourite is the good old beef burrito. i'm not a fan of the halibut at all, it is fish and chip kinda halibut, but was EXTREMELY filling for my lunch standards. it's the type that will put u into a coma after eatting it. the small size is good enough for a meal size. also the guacamole is included unlike the other burrito franchises out there. super cheap as well. lineups can get long, but you can call in for a pickup without the wait. the website super friendly showing the toppings and menu without any effort of a search. bummer not particularly a sit down place but there are a couple of seats available.
this is THE place for burritos."}
{"text":"Ordered a large chicken burrito. HUGE wrap. I m a 185lb guy with a big appetite and it will be two meals for me. Very tasty. Spicy sauce is very spicy though. So beware."}
{"text":"The omni-fare here is pretty good. The vegan and vegetarian options were pretty lackluster and the labeling for allergies was lacking, unfortunately. They just removed the meat and cheese without really trying to add something interesting back. I've had better burritos in rural New Hampshire (USA). It's noisy, crowded and cramped for the volume of people passing through so I'd recommend takeout or delivery. The staff was courteous and the prices were reasonable. The establishment and bathrooms were neat and clean."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after passing it so many times.

Bought a large chicken burrito with the works. Size was decent, definitely big enough to fill any appetite. I found my last few bites a chore to finish.
The burrito was loaded with cheese, it was impossible to take a bite without having stringy cheese leave your mouth. The cheese wasn't clumped into one spot and was evenly distributed. Well done.
The chicken was a tad dry, but the sauce and all the other fixings covered for it. 
Overall, a decent burrito. However it was hard to differentiate what made burrito and different from the rest. Due to this lack of star quality, I can only rate it 3/5. Nothing to earn my repeat business beside the quantity, price and late night hours."}
{"text":"Regular customer but after the abysmal customer service I experienced I have to leave this review. I ordered ahead over the phone and came in to pick up my order at the designated time. They asked my name and said they would call me when it was ready even though I saw burritos on the shelf. 8 people came in from outside and got their orders and 30 minutes later I walked up to the counter and asked what was going on and if that was my burrito on the shelf. They were embarrassed said sorry and offered me a free hot sauce. I emailed the company and they said they would get back to me but never did after following up. Step your game up."}
{"text":"I had a small veggie burrito from burrito boys for the first time. It tasted good but the service and the way the burrito was wrapped was poorly done and sloppy."}
{"text":"I love burritos and I love the ones at Burrito Boyz.

I had an early lunch at their College Street location today.

I got what I always get ... a large chicken burrito.  And it was huge and delicious and messy!

I don't know why the prices are blacked out on the menus since they are available.  Perhaps they have increased?

It was jammed with chicken, rice, beans, black beans, cheese, salsa, corn and burrito sauce ... yum!"}
{"text":"Gord, Trish and I had supper this evening at Burrito Boyz.  I've been to their old location lots of times but it's the first time I've been to the new one, which is a couple doors from the old one.

Trish ordered a small vegan burrito and said it was good.  Gord and I ordered small chicken burritos.  In mine, I got chicken, tomatoes, corn, two types of beans, rice, cheese, salsa and burrito sauce.  As always, it was delicious!  Yum!"}
{"text":"I love burritos and my favourite place to go is Burrito Boyz.

I was in Etobicoke today so stopped in at their Queensway location for lunch ... I'd never been there before.  I got there just before the noon rush.  I ate in their dining room

I ordered my usual ... a large chicken burrito and a pop.  I got chicken, rice, beans, cheese,
tomatoes, black beans, corn, salsa and burrito sauce.  As always, it was delicious!  I had cut it in half with the intent of eating half there and taking the other half home for supper ... but I couldn't resist and ate the whole thing!

The staff was friendly."}

{"text":"This stuff sure yanks my Mexican chain. Straight up not feelin' like Donald trump. 
The black beans really needs some adjusting, I really felt them the day after. They were solid in and solid out if you know what I mean. 
My entire burrito was Jennifer Lopez spicy when I was really interested in a more of a lady gaga type of sauce. They need to chill on the spice:) 
Overall, great food place will not build a wall around it."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. It was definitely a go to for a quick weekend lunch or after a night out. They moved from the tiny basement a couple of steps away to a larger scale place. 

Overall, the food is still pretty good, but not as good as I remembered. The one thing I noticed was that the servers aren't nearly as nice as before. They were a bit more abrupt with ordering and didn't really seem happy. Guess when you deal with drunk ppl all the time it's hard to adapt to normal ppl."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The burritos are huge and I can never finish it but you can't keep a burrito too long before it gets gross. That's not their fault though. The only suggestion for improvement is that they sometimes take a reeeaallly long time to get the food out, like ridiculously long."}
{"text":"These guys know how to do burritos right. Fair prices, great food made to order. Chill atmosphere and you can call your order in before you pick it up."}
{"text":"I'm giving Burrito Boyz a 3.5.
The place is SCUZZY lol. Like the floors look dirty and it looks like a converted shack, but the staff is fantastic.
The beef burrito, I wasn't a huge fan of the meat.
The rice was good. It could have been a bit saucier.
I would get it spicier next time. (I think I got it medium).
The wait was a little long but they want to make sure they're doing it right.
I went at about 10 or 11 pm on Friday (Valentine's day) and the place was really busy.
There are probably 8 spots along the front window to sit and that's it.
There is no parking here (in the winter). It was unplowed.
I parked directly beside it in the beer store parking lot.
There is a \"walkway\" between the two lots. Aka a piece of wet wood you can walk over to a void a gaping hole.
Everything about this place kind of screams dirty but the food stations are well maintained and the food is good (why else would it be so packed?!).
They have an option where you can call ahead and they'll make your burritos for pick up.
I would suggest doing that.
Overall the burrito was satisfactory. I'm super picky with my meat and that's why I didn't love it.
My boyfriend really liked it. I felt like it was a healthier alternative to Mcdonalds (and I felt like with all the veggies maybe it was healthy!) and the options in Brampton after 9 p.m. are realllllllly slim."}
{"text":"I see the appeal to Burrito Boyz on Adelaide. I have been hearing about it for ages through co-workers about the portion sizes and also the \"free guac\" which is no longer a thing - but still... 

I am not a burrito person, so it took me being in the burrito-mood to try it. Although, I now realize they have naked burrito's which I feel I would be more apt to get on a regular day. I came here on a Saturday early evening. It wasn't busy. Service at the till and the filling station was A+, like super friendly and helpful with recommendations. So thank-you. I can be indecisive. 

I was recommended that the GF option was also called the \"four bite\" burrito. That was good to know because I was really hungry. Major thank-you, as that would have been disappointing. I decided on the small halibut burrito in a normal tortilla.. it was definitely filling, and my taste buds were happy. I would 100% come back and recommend this place to any burrito (or burrito-type ingredients.. naked burrito!) fan or super hungry individual :)"}
{"text":"Tastes amazing.  That's why I don't understand why they feel the need to put rubber bands in their burritos."}
{"text":"I got a chicken burrito at Burrito Boyz today at the Dundas location. I wouldn't recommend the location since there is no seating. The staff was not very friendly.

The burrito was okay, but the chicken was kind of dry. There is nothing special about the burrito. It is comparable to Chipotle and Bar Burrito in term of taste and ingredients."}
{"text":"Chicken Burrito: I like how guacamole is free (*cough unlike Chipotle) and is real - not the fake powdered stuff you get at pubs for +$2.

Chips: Pretty good also. I think they make their own tortilla chips. I'm not 100% sure but it's not the Tostitos chips you get at supermarkets and you can't go wrong with only $1.99 for a bag.

Summary: I'd go here again after a fun night of clubbing. I've never been to the Smoke's Burritorie next door but why would I try it when BurritoBoyz is a solid choice."}
{"text":"First time going yesterday and I thought that being there a bit later (at 1 pm) than the usual lunch hour would have less people, but there were still a lot of people! It was busy, so the food came out slow, but I'm sure they were doing the best they could. The food was great! I got the naked burrito box - haddock in a small; it was VERY filling. The steak burrito in a large was extremely filling as well; so if you are interested but don't eat a lot, then try the small size."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto and trying various places and types of food, this is the only other place we'd give 5 stars too (the other being Banh Mi Boys).

My boyfriend and I shared a spicy steak and chicken burrito with everything in it.  Their ingredients were amazing and on top of making a great burrito, they place it on the grill making it nice and crispy!  

I don't think there's any place in Los Angeles that does this and I wish they did.  Not only does it give the burrito a nice crisp, it helps bind it together so that it doesn't fall a part when you eat it.  I loved the little thai chili's or whatever they threw in the burrito.  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Only reason these guys get a 2 star is bc they have a restroom.

I'm a huge fan of burrito boyz. Love the naked bowl. This location was just terrible. The  refried beans were way too watered down and the shrimp was not sautéed with garlic even though we said no dairy. The chicken was luke warm at best.

I wouldn't come to this location again. 

I usually go to the burrito boys at progress and Kennedy and their amazing. Always consistent with their bowls. No runny watered down refried beans, no lukewarm chicken and no un sautéed shrimp. Only thing is they don't have a restroom."}
{"text":"It is a pretty good burrito place and it is not too pricey. Though i would suggest eating the quasidella (forgot how to spell) as well. 
Its a pretty good place to eat but since its more of a takeout place, it might not be the best place to take your date if you want some place fancy. 
Its more for a casual date or place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"... must admit.  It surpassed what I expected.  Except there was a man doing repairs on the restaurant equipment (underneath the equipment) with the food exposed on top of the equipment.  Didn't make me feel overly confident when the repair man in his work clothes brushed by the food (NOT HIS FAULT).  Anyway, I am just OCD so it must be me.

Having said that, the food was FRESH AND DELICIOUS.  Small burrito hit the spot for me - I am totally full and satisfied."}
{"text":"steak with rice and salad amazingggg

so flavourful and a decent price for the size!"}
{"text":"Excited when BB was going to open a spot near my hood.  When I ordered numerous times there realized it's not as good as the locations I have gone to. For example stave bank, lakeshore and Queensway locations have some fresh burritos there..  It's just a good reminder that these places are Franchises and that some places can't replicate the quality of food and service at the better locations that put BB in the TOP.  Noticed that they're stingy with food hence the scale they have in the place.  Other BBS I've been too doesn't do that.  Now when you order a seafood burito for $10+ you expect it to be good and fresh. 1st time it wasn't,  shame on them. 2nd time around not good again I've let them know about it and unfortunately they weren't able to help me about the poor quality food. Shame on me I guess for giving them another try.  This location is dragging the good name in the mud.  I will play smart and drive to the other locations that do it right."}
{"text":"Filling, savoury, affordable deal. Very tasty, amazing prices and does the job. You will never be disappointed with Burrito Boyz! A good go to late night or even lunch or dinner. 
They're hot sauce is HOT and I love it!!! 
Must try!"}
{"text":"New, closer for me than Stavebank, location for Burrito Boyz. I had a perfect small-Hali that was at least as good as any burrito from the original Port Credit location. In fact it was tastier than anything from there I years. A great spot for a quick hot lunch. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Sorry this location doesn't compare to the other locations I have been to (Brampton-Hurontario, Woodbridge and Adelaide). The guacamole was brown, they slopped the sweet potatoes on and they barely gave any rice, but did spread it around to make it look like a lot...the chicken princes were large pieces where it is normally cut in smaller pieces. Not sure why they have 4.1 stars but I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Basic Mexican from uninspired Mexican equivalent to Subway. They should be more generous and flexible with the ingredients--especially because there's nothing special about the ingredients. They use cheese sauce on nachos. Can't tell if the staff is unfriendly because they hate their jobs or because it's too loud to be heard."}
{"text":"Just average. I didn't find anything that special about Burrito Boyz. I've been here on two occasions and both times the food was average and I didn't like that we had to wait a while for it to be ready.

I've ordered the steak & sweet potato previously but it was not that impressive imho. The good thing was it was certainly filling. The small felt like a large to me. 

Would come back again if I were in the area & if nothing else is opened. But I kind of feel like it's not that hard to make this on our own."}
{"text":"Ordered a shrimp quesadilla. I got it quickly but it was not hot, just warm. The cheese was not melted so all the ingredients fell out of the shell. Very disappointed. The Scarborough location is 10000 times better. The customer service was also not good. Not friendly! Take lessons from the Scarborough location!!!"}
{"text":"Best burrito boyz I've been to. Lots of space to eat indoor and outdoor. 

I've been to a few BB and I do enjoy the halibut and haddock. That's about all I order from there. This location is on par with all the others. 

What they have going for them is the space and they were fully staffed even during a rush everyone was served in a timely manner. 

The con is parking. Even on my motorcycle it was tight."}
{"text":"There's not much in this area aside from some big box stores, industrial sites and car dealerships so I was surprised to learn that there was a Burrito Boyz around here. The place is huge, bright with ample seating for groups but it doesn't feel like a dine in place you can sit around in for a while (which is a non-issue for me). Since it's a QSR things are usually done at the counter and then you go through your toppings and wait for them to wrap and grill it.

Ingredients were fresh, service was friendly and personable, and the final product was awesome. If you're one of those people who don't like saucy, overstuffed, burritos you might want to hold back on a lot of the wet ingredients that have higher moisture (tomato/onions/salsa/burrito sauce/hot sauce). Gladly, I'm not one of those people so I happily saunter off with my huge tasty burrito and have a blast."}
{"text":"Great food. My fav midnight Mexican food place. Spicy and tasty. There is usually a big line up. They accept USD so extra brownie point for that. I went there every other day throughout my stay in Toronto."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!  I came across one in Toronto first, loved it, and was STOKED to find that there was one in Mississauga too!!  I wasn't expecting it to be as good, but it is!!

First of all, the burritos - they're HUGE!!  So very filling, and absolutely fantastic.  I worked up the nerve to try the fish burritos (they have haddock and halibut) and never looked back, they're delicious!!  If you're feelin brave and decide to get some hot sauce, go easy on it - it's pretty damn hot (being West Indian, I know hot - trust me when I say that it's HOT)!!

The staff there is great!  It makes for such a great atmosphere when the staff is in a good mood, and they always are at this place!!  There's nowhere to eat inside of the restaurant as it's very small, but for the time that you're in there and subjected to the staff, they'll put a smile on your face.  :)

The place can get very busy, but I find the staff does a really good job of keeping a steady flow going.  Don't let a bit of a line-up discourage you!"}
{"text":"everything is so fresh!
the bean paste is so delish, all the meat/soy are grilled on each order"}
{"text":"Great service, great attitude!  Consistent great burrito!    I knew you were good, but it really hit home when I went to the Queensway location and saw how little they cared.    Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burrito that you can find in the city! Chipotle and Chino Locos don't even hold a candle to this place. My favorite is a chicken/steak hybrid burrito on a whole wheat tortilla with extra guacamole. All the fresh ingredients just flow so well together, which end up making my mouth water while waiting for my order."}
{"text":"The best part of my meal was the jumex quava drink.  I ordered the small steak burrito- and it was way under-seasoned, even the 'spicy salsa' couldn't redeem it.  I got about 5 black beans with and when I asked for more she put 5 more on.  

I think you need to have a few before enjoying this place.  Quality over quality... And it's still almost $8 for a small steak burrito!  I'm not too impressed- they need to find the balance.  

I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is usually busy but you can call ahead to order. Very simple menu, fresh ingredients and good service."}
{"text":"Chipotle or Burrito Boyz? hmm, I ask myself which is the best, but, honestly, I enjoy both. I came here around 2:30pm and boy was I surprised with the amount of people for a late lunch (I thought I could avoid the lunch rush). If you came here for a burrito review, I am sorry to disappoint, but this is towards a naked burrito bowl!

Ordered:
1) Small burrito bowl mix of chicken and steak in a squared box $8.50 including tax
- had all the toppings except jalapenos (I can eat spicy, but not jalapeno spicy - yes, I'm weird like that)
- This even included Guacamole :)

Review: 4/5 stars! 
- I really enjoyed this because I feel like you get less toppings with a burrito. Plus, you can bypass the people who ordered burritos and have your food first!
- Need protein? I suggest you get a large which is about $2 more I believe and you get more meat for all you gym rats
- IMO, I feel like you get more value with Burrito Boyz (guacamole included) and the portion sizes are a little bit bigger than Chipotle. Chipotle, I feel has fresher ingredients, but give you less toppings. Either way, I enjoy both. 

Would I come here again?
- Yes, most definitely, if you are looking for a cheap lunch under $10 and/or for your burrito fix, this is the spot to come for
- P.S, this place gets really busy during the late nights after people finish their night of drinking/clubbing - perfect meal 

Helpful Tips
- Address:  It is right beside Smoke's Poutinerie on Adelaide (Close to Adelaide/Duncan and/or 5 min walk from Scotiabank Theatre)
- Methods of Payment: Cash, debit, credit card 
- I believe they have a burrito special between 2:30-5? (Don't quote me on this, I heard from a friend)
- It is right beside Smoke's Poutinerie on Adelaide (Close to Adelaide/Duncan and/or 5 min walk from Scotiabank Theatre)"}
{"text":"CONSUMER WARNING - THE DEMOGRAPHIC FOR THEIR SMALL GLUTEN FREE BURRITOS ARE SPARROWS OR BABY BIRDS. THEY ARE SMALL. SO SMALL YOU WILL FEEL ENTIRELY RIPPED OFF AND USED IF YOU ARE A HUMAN WITH A NORMAL APPETITE.

Seriously, why does Burrito Boyz make the BEST, but ONLY gluten free burrito in town? Why? And why is their small GF so fucking tragic? You are literally paying $7 for a snack. AND they charge you extra for the GF tortilla. This should be like four fucking dollars because the amount of filling they put in here was a joke. Did they shaft me? My boyfriend got a large chicken and maybe they were like \"Oh, fuck this, this little baby bird burrito doesn't even need chicken,\" *pours the scraps of chicken left over from the large burrito*. I had maybe a total of 3 pieces of chicken?!?!?!!? This gluten free burrito fit in the palm of my hand (yes I have larger man hands) But still!!! WHAT THE FUCK. I ate the thing in literally EIGHT BITES. Like, even their small flour tortilla burrito is a two-hand affair.

I TRUSTED YOU BURRITO BOYZ. I WAS LOYAL. BUT YOU SCREWED ME. WHHHHYYYYYY."}
{"text":"As an American that moved to toronto, I have long been searching for a good Mexican place to eat...and the search goes on....what can I say about this place....it tries  too hard but doesn't do the basics right....plus no tacos?...maybe I'm just spoiled by the abundance of choice south of the border...."}
{"text":"I LOVE their burritos.  Went by Burrito Boyz on a Friday night around 2:30am and the line was huge and out of the door.  As we were too tired and hungry to wait in line, we decided to go to the pountine place upstairs.  The next day, I decided to return to Burrito Boyz and try out their famous wraps. What can I say? Halibut burrtito, as recommended by most of the Yelp users, is the most amazing burrito I have ever had.  The best of everything.  The fish was big and juicy, the ingredients are fresh, the hot sauce is just the right amount.  This place runs their business really well.  They are always busy and the toppings are always refilled to the top.  Love how they grill the wrap to the perfect temperate.  I really got nothing to complain about this place!  I loved it so much that I had to get another halibut burrito the next day!"}
{"text":"After a long jaunt around the Lake (on a warm August day) and a long perusal of the beach area and all things beach-ian, and then a seemingly longer trip to a neighboring grocery store on a hunt for a dinner menu to be served later in the evening, I was more then just hungry with a case of the shakes, I could've eaten Rob Ford at this point! (Nice, eh?) But Burrito Boyz out here in the 'burbs more than sufficed! As a resident and native of the southern United States, I am more than well-versed on all things Burrito-an, and I will say that my Burrito Boyz Canadian burrito that I grabbed on the go and absolutely devoured in the nearby basement of an Etobicoke home (while watching a Breaking Bad marathon, I might add), more than fed this normally well-fed Southern man. Though far from the Mexican border, this burrito was as spicy and tasty as it was robust and plump! And I will also say this, my burrito that I chowed down on was every bit as savory and authentic as any burrito from my neck of the woods! Viva Burrito Boyz! Who knew? You want a good burrito? Go to Burrito Boyz in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I work for a luxury car dealership and it's my duty to order lunch for the entire office... last weekend I decided to give this place a go.. 

While I most likely will not ever order from here again I do feel like I should inform others about what they can expect. 

We were told that they delivery however after compiling everyone's order for the office and calling in we were told that the driver was not in and we would have to pick it up..  the entire Reason for ordering lunch in at the office is to avoid the staff leaving the premises to get more work done.. FAIL we decided to send someone because we had wasted so much time filling out the order form.

After receiving the order we realized that we weren't given any cutlery for any of the \"naked burrito salads\" so another trip was made to a closer establishment to procure utensils . FAIL.

I ordered a naked burrito and specified in the designated \"special notes\" section that the salsa, sour cream and burrito sauce should be placed on the side or in another container so as not to touch the food. WHEN IT CAME every surface of it was covered with the three condiments. So I had to literallly forfeit more than half of the lunch because it was inedible. FAIL

***the ONLY half decent thing I can say (and why I have it two stars) is the portioning is quite generous. Other than that I most likely would never recommend or order it for the staff of 15 I place orders for on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"I'm from the States, and OH MY GOD IS THIS THE BEST BURRITO I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. EVERY SINGLE time I visit my best friend in Canada, I make her take me here for my first meal. The chicken burrito is so good, so wonderfully flavored it puts all the burrito chains in the States to shame. I don't even mind waiting in the clusterfuckery that is the line, because the food is THAT good. I've also tried the halibut burrito. Just as amazing. I always tell my best friend I wouldn't trade her for the world--except maybe some Burrito Boyz."}
{"text":"Burrito cravings answered and much appreciated in an area that already has a ton of Asian and Middle eastern eats.

Fave picks: basa fish, chicken or shrimp and steak mixed with all of the fillings and extra spicy.. I likah it HOT!!!! 

Located next to the Pork Bone Soup masters, this place also manages to pull in the crowds as it's open late (4am I think Friday and Sats?) 

Can never go wrong with a burrito amigo! I mean isn't the burrito the newest food staple to flexible dieters nowadays, no? 
Macros and iifym or better yet known as gainsssss? Great choice!!!"}
{"text":"Pure awesomeness.
For the quantity that you get for the price, it's definitely a great value meal.
They're also open late at night on the weekends for that downtown stroll..."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday at around 3am and was so happy to find that there was no lineup! I always go to the downtown location near the club district and end up waiting forever. I ordered and got my food really quickly. The girl stuffing the burrito was really nice. Now, I say all of this because I am used to the other location that is super packed and full of people who just came out of clubs...so the crowd isn't the greatest and I understand why they're so annoyed with everyone there. I did ask the girl here if it was always this empty and she said that we were actually lucky, because the crowd just left. 

The steak burrito is soooo good! I definitely suggest getting it. The small size is actually really not that small. They stuff it with everything you want: refried beans, rice, corn, tomatoes, guac, etc. Anyway, I'm starting to salivate just enumerating the ingredients. Definitely great for lunch, dinner, after partying or any other time. A bunch of people after us were ordering the shrimp burritos, so I'm curious to try those."}
{"text":"My boyfriend raved about this place almost weekly while he was attending a programming boot camp nearby. When I finally went, I could see what he was talking about.

First off, these burritos are ENORMOUS! I have travelled and lived in Mexico for a total of 4 months and I can't say I've ever eaten anything so ginormous as at this place. They don't really serve the most authentic burritos, but they don't try to pretend like they do and it's still delicious. They stuff that log of a burrito as full as possible (which actually stays fairly well together as you eat it) and let you choose the ingredients that go inside. 

A bunch of people mentioned that the burritos are prepared fairly quickly, but I've found each time it's taken around 10-15mins. So while the restaurant is laid out fairly similarly to a fast food place (large counter to order and select ingredients and small dining area) you won't be served quite as quickly as a Subway. 

The service is super friendly and I can see why people come back consistently. The servers recognize their regulars and treat them well! While I wouldn't recommend heading here for a sit-down dinner, Burrito Boyz is a reliable source of burritos guaranteed to fill anyone up"}
{"text":"Burrito boys never fails whenever you want a quick and simple bite. The ingredients are fresh and they are made to order. The best are the steak and sweet potato burritos. The chicken quesadilla doesn't disappoint either. 

I have been to the Adelaide, College locations and just recently to their Yonge street location. The food and service are consistent."}
{"text":"This place is fast in service and the food is consistently good for the price.  They changed their order sizes recently and the large is a lot of food especially if you get the naked one in a take out box.  The only downside is the chicken is sometimes not as fresh.  The rest of their ingredients is pretty good and they give you Guac for free.  Only burrito chain that does that.  A favourite for late night semi healthy  food fast."}
{"text":"Mmm, how have I never had a burrito before? My husband informed me that he noticed on his last venture into burrito boyz that they had gluten free options. Of course I had to try since anything that involves tortillas, guac and salsa is a winner in my mind. I ordered the steak burrito, which only comes in one size (3/4lb). Fine by me! 
Once we notified them that I wasn't eating gfree to be trendy, they took great care in making sure my food was free from cross contamination - obv only as much as any restaurant can do, but still. They heated my tortilla on a piece of foil so that it didn't touch the grill that the regular ones touched and actually re-wrapped it afterwards in clean foil that hasn't touched the grill. I didn't have the rice or refried beans but as far as I know, they are also gfree. Maybe next time! I really enjoyed the toppings and wish I had thought to request sour cream because that would have put it over the top! Regardless, it was divine! My only real qualm was the lady was kind of chincy on the veg toppings and I think I had subway in mind when I asked for more diced tomatoes and she literally gave me three more squares of diced tomato. Really? 
We got there about 5 mins before 5pm so we were able to take advantage of the happy hour deal. Buy one get one 50% off. 
My husband had the halibut and said it was really good but because halibut is such an expensive fish, the amount of fish wasn't as much as say the steak or chicken. There are so many options here and I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious burritos. Quick friendly staff and a fantastic location. My go to burrito is the large chicken with all toppings and a good amount of hot sauce. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I got the small veggie burrito and regretted eating it all at once. It was delicous but waaay to big! Amazing price, great options!"}
{"text":"Great place, food is always fresh and delicious. Recommend calling in your order ahead of time - gets pretty backed up during peak hours."}
{"text":"Just notes here:

-big portions
-nice guac (so its 0.80 now; avacados are expensive thanks to hipsters and their breakfast toast avacado)
-4 pieces of fried little balls, which is suppose to be calamari(just look at my picture)

fastfood, definetly guilty after eating"}
{"text":"One of my favourite burrito boyz locations in all of toronto and close to home. Quick service for a burrito place and excellent burritos every time I visit. Super flavourful and definitely filling for sure. I don't eat much else from here because I love the burritos a lot, would recommend to anyone looking for a good satisfying meal."}
{"text":"My favorite burrito place. Large portions with fresh produce. Have not had a bad one yet. Love this place! The locations are small so chairs to sit and eat are at a premium."}
{"text":"Nice addition to Parkdale.
Enjoy the food and a great location."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Reasonable price for a good burrito!  If I were downtown more often, I would go here all the time.  Service is exceptionally well organized and staff are well trained and good at their jobs! Even during lunch rushes, they are extremely fast.

There need to me more places like this."}
{"text":"What a great burrito! Got the \"small\" and thank God I did, because it was extremely filling and extremely tasty! Love the fresh ingredients and so many options to choose from! The mix and match option (i.e. chicken AND steak) is fantastic and makes it easier to make a decision! Love the fact that they were grilled....just helped the flavours meld all together.  I'm a huge fan of the bowls at Chipotle, but Burrito Boyz kicks the pants off of their burritos!"}
{"text":"Best thing they have going for them? Toasty goodness. 

In my experience eying over the ingredients wasn't as exciting as other more chain-like (read: Chipotle) places that wrap up a mean mess of options. I can't quite put my finger on it, things just looked processed/canned, not super yummy and fresh. I'll say the place gives you a ton of options for insides though, and the prices are extremely reasonable. And again grilling is where it's at, such an awesome way to complete these hot pockets. I did feel a little iffy after chowing down, though that could have been because it was really late at night. 

I guess you can say it's fine for what it is, I don't think you come here to be blown away. And if burrito options are truly as slim as friends in Toronto have told me, I suppose it does the trick."}
{"text":"As an outsider and someone who loves Mexican food I was thrilled to try this place. However I was not impressed at all and to be somewhat honest in the four days in Toronto I had better Mexican food. Perhaps it was the nacho's and that is what I got. I was disappointed I paid for guacamole and they didn't give it to me. It was crowded so clearly I went in the wrong direction on choices."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!! We were looking for someplace to quickly grab food around 11pm and are so glad we found burrito boys! We got our food very quickly and it was such a good amount of food for the price. I would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This location is the same as the rest Burrito boyz are ok nothing to write home about. I will admit kinda a dick move on their part opening right across the street from Fat bastard with the rest of scarborough left untapped for a burrito location till pickering."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Very impressed with owners. They apologized for a mistake that happened and made a huge effort to make it better. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of time.  Fat Bastard across the street is much better.  Had the fish burrito here and did not taste fresh at all.  I didn't even finish it.  Be other time I had chicken and it was underwhelming.  Will most likely not be back.  Also parking here sucks!"}
{"text":"Spicy halibut is on point, it used to be a bit better but I feel as they got bigger and expanded they lost a bit of their quality.  But still one of the best burritos I've ever had."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz is a fine Toronto establishment. Honestly, a pretty darn good burrito. If a burrito was well-rounded, this would be it. Filling, delicious, great sauce that just oozes out when you chomp down. Great temperature, nice grill. It gets messy, so make sure to grab \"napkinz\".  Unfortunately, this delicious burrito left me with a slight stomachache... You can't have it all."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm a fan of this restaurant name. 7th grade Issabelle used to change all the s's to z's at the end of certain words. For example, girls would become girlz. Don't ask me why, it was just something I did. So when I walked by this spot on a late evening in Toronto, I just had to make a quick pit stop. 

I was on my way home from a night out and needed to satisfy my belly for a post-party meal. A burrito it was. This spot reminded me of Chipotle, but better. You had the option to choose between flour and wheat tortillas, and had more fillings to choose from. I had mine filled with chicken, black beans, (extra) guac, mild salsa, queso cheese, and brown rice. For being a weekend evening, I was pretty surprised at how quickly I received my burrito. 

I took mine to go, but they do have a few tables if you decide to sit down and enjoy your meal. I was able to enjoy my burrito on my cozy couch and was not disappointed. I saved a bit for the next day. Usually a burrito don't... But surprisingly, my leftover burrito didn't taste too bad. I usually wouldn't recommend doing this, but hey a hungry belly calls sometimes. 

Overall, I'm happy that I stumbled upon this place. Thank you Burrito Boyz for making a tasty burrito that satisfied my late night craving."}
{"text":"How?  How do you have a burrito joint without a public restroom?
Burrito Boys is a great place and has great food, but anxiety runs high when you're going to eat burritos and there is no washroom around."}
{"text":"While the burritos are ok on all my visits they're definitely not great. A lot of reviewers point to serving size as the reason for their good food review, but I feel like the quality and taste of all ingredients could be better. 

Pretty terrible customer service, you feel like a supplicant on their doorstep trying to order."}
{"text":"One of the Best Burritos I have ever had! You choose what you want to put inside, the topping selection is great and they put a lot. 
I took the Large Burrito which is 1.5 pound and couldn't stop eating till I finished it!
The place inside is a bit old and their combo chips is not even close to being as good as the Burrito.
Bottom line, it is highly recommended for lunch!"}
{"text":"First off the food is amazing and the staff is great! I loved everything about this except for the loudness and disorganization of the experience. If they better streamlined the ordering process (yes you can phone in ahead but that only partially works) then this place would easily get a perfect rating. 

Highly recommend this place, just not when it is really busy."}
{"text":"Wasn't very busy and yet they some how lost my order.. ended up waiting a ridiculously long time for my veggie soy. I have been before and they have been typically pretty good, today was clearly an off day."}
{"text":"They've got their burritos right! Even the small size is enough to fill you silly and it's packed with all the essential flavors and textures. So far I've tried chicken & halibut and loved both! Next time I'm eyeing the shrimp burritos.. Service is friendly and efficient. It may take a while to get the stuff ready but I don't mind the little wait. I think it's better for take away though, because they only have a few tables which could easily get full especially during lunch. But no worries, if you want to gulp down your burritos right away you can do so outside by the sidewalk-- quite a pleasant 'hood."}
{"text":"As a burrito enthusiast in my hometown of Boston, I am frequently faced with skepticism from friends from California or Texas or what have you - \"Burritos in Boston? You have to be kidding me.\" I imagine that the hurdles for burritiologists (is that a thing?) in Toronto must be even higher. In any case, I was excited to try it based on the other reviews and a recommendation from a friend.

After a large lunch there, I'd say it's.. okay. The burritos are tasty although not outstanding, and I'm not sure I'm a big fan of the serving style.

Let me elaborate - I do rather enjoy the assembly-line style of burritos - quick, efficient, and you always get the exact burrito fillings you want, while Burrito Boys bastardizes that just enough for it to be recognizable without retaining many of the benefits of such an arrangement. 

All in all, It takes about ten minutes to get your burrito, which involves three trips to the counter and two exchanges of vouchers. (Order and pay, drop off receipt and specify toppings, drop off number and pick up burrito.)

The payoff for the wait is decent -- the grilling/pressing at the end means you get a crispy outside and a very evenly warm inside, which is pretty cool. Also you get it loaded full of toppings (including super spicy hot sauces!) without having to pay extra, which is sweet. 

My only serious qualm is with the meat - the steak is the tougher cheesesteak style instead of the tex-mex standard flank steak style.

In the end, a decent burrito but not a phenomenal one, and being the speed of sit down restaurant while offering the service of a fast food place doesn't help."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Burrito Boyz! I've been coming here for the last 5 years and it's my all time favourite burrito joint.

The service is great, even when there's always a massive line on Friday/Saturday nights. 

Their burritos are delicious and always have a generous amount of toppings ... And who can complain when there's free guac? :)"}
{"text":"Great service! They all really do try to make you feel welcome and comfortable throughout your experience here. I've been to the Burrito Boyz at Adelaide and they're both the same and consistent with their service and quality. I got their large Steak Burrito and it was delicious and filling. Did not regret coming to a Burrito Boyz the second time and will probably come back again."}
{"text":"My friends and I arrived during a busy presence but the skill, speed, friendliness, and service the employees had was amazing. My friends and I left pleased. 

I ordered a small steak burrito on a whole wheat tortilla. The burrito was definitely bigger than I imagined. It was big enough to fool me into thinking I actually bought a large burrito. Overall, the size was big and filling. At first, I was afraid the steak in my burrito would not be cooked well-done and chewy but in the end, the steak was cooked thoroughly and well-done. The variety of meats and toppings offered is amazing. One tiny thing that would make this place more than perfect is if they had ground beef as one of their meat option, but no matter what, Burrito Boyz is amazing for a burrito joint. 

Also, the washroom was pretty dark, small, and tight.

Overall, burrito tasted great, very affordable, and a wide variety of toppings and meat."}
{"text":"Craving mexican? This place gives you the best bang for your burrito! Located just one block off Streetsville's main entertainment area, Burrito Boyz gives you a burrito at a great price loaded with fresh toppings. They will also let you customize your creation as well, and you can request more or less of your favourite toppings and sauces. Seating is limited so its better to take out. Service is fast and friendly. For under $10 including taxes per person  you can have a great tasting meal with a drink."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food at reasonable prices. The food is excellent, you can tell all the ingredients are fresh and well sourced."}

{"text":"This place quality dropped significantly. Had a chicken burrito today and had to throw it out after few bites. Missing seasoning and under cooked chicken. Awful."}
{"text":"The food is fine. Just try and avoid it during lunch or dinner hours. I ordered through the phone and they gave me the wrong order, which I realized after biting in to my burrito. I let them know and they kindly offered to remake it. This took another 20 mins and they gave me a wrong order yet again. Gave up at this point as it would take another hour to sort things out. TLDR: avoid during busy hours if you care about getting what you ordered (especially if you have allergies or food sensitivities)"}
{"text":"Sorry but my standards have been set high after living in San Diego for awhile. 

Its probably a 4 star for Toronto mexican food. Somewhat like Chipotle but I don't understand the wait. Took about 10 minutes to get a burrito, guess they were heating something up. Chipotle is a lot faster but overall the burrito was pretty good.

Nothing compared to SD joints though but if you are having a craving for mexican food in Toronto, stop by. 

P.S. Grab a poutine upstairs and fulfill two cravings at once!"}
{"text":"The burrito's themselves were tasty. Service was a bit \"hipster indifferent\" but I guess that's part of the ambiance. This place was talked up quite a bit so maybe my expectations were higher than they should have been. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here cause we wanted to try it out here, smalls are really big so we were happy. We got beans and cheese,  and the soy burrito both were good. We asked for extra spicy but wasn't spicy enough otherwise it was all good."}
{"text":"Ive been eating at Burrito Boyz for several years now. The other locations definitely have better customer service than this one. The employees here seem to have attitude, they aren't happy with there job. Can't you work anywhere you want? If you don't like your job then you have the freedom to work somewhere else. Nobody's forcing you to make burritos and quesadillas for a living lol. Anyway on to the reason why I wrote this review. My order was burnt. Didn't realize it was burnt until I got home. I flipped the quesadilla over and realized it was all burnt. The cook decided to hide it by flipping the quesadilla over hiding the burnt side. Pretty smart guy. I drove back to the restaurant and showed the manager. She gave me nothing but attitude. She finally agreed to redo my order. I also asked her to compensate me for my troubles, for them burning my food and hiding it from me. She thought I wanted to be compensated for my gas money. After a long time of arguing she finally gave me a coupon. I cant recommend this location of burrito boyz. There are several locations in GTA that have much better customer service and they wont burn your food and then argue with you about it."}
{"text":"This is probably the best burrito place ever in Toronto. Their portions are quite generous and the food is quite fresh.
When it comes to service they are pretty friendly and quite efficient. 
Reasonable prize too.
I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Never ever am i disappointed by this place, the owner and his brother are two young guys and do there best to provide a great product. 
I have had beef, Chicken, Halibut and Shrimp. 

Halibut is the best by far and the others were good, i lay a little low on the beans extra burrito sauce and the Halibut Burrito is shocking how good it is. 

Place gets really busy on the weekend."}
{"text":"As a (relatively) new dad, I sometimes pause to think about how different my childrens' world will be than the one in which I grew up. 

I predate the internet, cell phones, reality TV and President Trump. 

I grew up with Hulkamania and MTV and metal and grunge and plaid flannel and neon everything. 

And if I went to a food court, it was for a slice of pizza or a greaseball burger or a paper plate stacked with soy-sauced carbs. If I craved \"mexican\", my options were Taco Bell or dropping dead. 

Thankfully, the world has become a smaller place since then, and food trends have migrated that much faster. By the time I hit university, exoticisms like Sushi and Burritos and falafel had become readily available and affordable. 


They say you always remember your first...burrito, that is. Mine arrived, wrapped in foil, the size of a newborn at their old location on Adelaide. Lined out the door, even at an obscenely late hour for an office lunch, Burrito Boyz' excellent halibut burrito marked my entry to this glorious world, promising a full tummy and tastebuds alit with habanero heat, even on the shoestring students' dining budget that I keep to this day (feeding and housing and clothing my children have replaced tuition and books as my biggest expenses. Lunch out is an occasional treat, meaning I strive to maximize bang for buckage).   

That location is now closed, although it had long since changed names to \"Burrito Banditos\" following the dissolution of the owners' business partnership. Which was actually good news for Toronto's growing cadre of burrito addicts, as the two shops-with similar products-expanded across the city. I eat at and enjoy both, although I slightly prefer the Boyz to their outlaw cousins. Slightly larger portions and a broader more economy-minded menu (haddock and calamari options, for example let me indulge my yen for alt-mexican seafood without committing $15 to my beloved halibut). 

Which brings me to this location; opened a short walk from the Eaton Centre, about 15 minutes from my office. 

Let it be known that downtown Toronto has become overrun with burrito chains. I can walk to Fat Bastard, Banditos, Chipotle, Z-Teca, Fresh West, Freshii, Burrito Bar, Mucho Burrito and a few others, and still make it back to my desk within an hour. I've tried them all, but sentimental reasons aside I keep coming back here.

Burrito Boyz still packs them in. A line still spills out the door, and Burrito Wait Times should be tracked by a government registry. The servers still turn over but are uniformly friendly and can answer your burrito-related queries. Pay the higher price and split your proteins. Stuff your tortilla with all the produce and starch and explosive hot sauce you like. 

Chicken and beef are most popular, but I stick with the haddock now; watching the fillets crisp in the fryer before burrit-insertion has become a fun lunch hour pastime. Asked what I want in my tortilla, I just say \"Yes\". This is no time for restraint. Rolled tight and placed on the flat top, it rests getting ever darker and crisper; cheese and sauces permeating throughout (although sometimes I opt for a bowl to save carbs and because meals eaten with a knife and fork are for classy rich folk).

You can also combo it up with a side of tortilla chips and a soft drink. If you need to fill up on this, you're doing it wrong. Go back and order another, like I did. And keep doing so until you get it right. 

I take my meal to go, and inhale it. 

Growing up I had never known such fast food perfection. The crunch of the tortilla as I break through; the golden crust and sweet soft fish inside; the jumble of textures and flavours from sweet to spicy to sour to salty in each bite. I can and have gone months with this as my exclusive lunchtime treat. 

The influx of fine burritos to the city of my birth may be the greatest gift my children will ever receive. 

Once the eight-month old is fully on solids and can eat a jalapeno without exploding. 

And the two-year old expands his palate beyond peanut butter sandwiches (not even on crispy tortillas!)

And assuming President Trump doesn't blow us all to Hell."}
{"text":"You always remember your first...burrito. 

Long before I established myself as a *ahem* successful professional, I was a struggling student, drawn like many by the siren call of cheap eats. 

The internet was new; crowdsourced reviews had not yet been invented, so my best source for culinary happenings down town were local alternative newspapers. 

At one point, Toronto had two; that number has been halved. 

I couldn't tell you which one held the first review for burrito boyz, but it was glowing; a hot new trend bubbling up from the USA, mimicked here as good as advertised. Cheap, filling and cheap. 

I had to give it a shot. 

Unfortunately, it would be a little while before I made it to the spot-my work kept me busy at the office, and if Yelp wasn't a thing yet, you can imagine that delivery services like uberEats weren't even a thought.

So I waited until an executive lunch opportunity presented itself, and embarked into the darkest regions of Toronto's then-clubland. 

This is an important point: when Burrito Boyz first opened, the neighbourhood was quiet duribng the day, but overrun at night by herds of starving, predatory bros en route from once club to the next. Even still, in its early days the basement storefront was often lined up for lunch; a spot at a communal picnic table a rare find unless you took a really really late lunch. 

But one day I made it in, and came back semi-regularly until the partnership split (Burrito Banditos is an offshoot) and more locations and competitors made burritos readily available. 

My go-to is, was and likely always will be the halibut. a golden crispy filet surrounded by standard burrito fixings like rice, beans, salsa and guacamole. A line or two of incendiary hot sauce, and a light crispy charred tortilla fresh off the flat top grill. I apologize to fish enthusiasts everywhere, but I've learned to max out on crunch by ordering the fish well done (otherwise it tends to mushy). 

I don't think this is actually the original location-it's moved as the neighbourhood has changed. The clubs are now condos, and the lines are much shorter. 

But like I said, you never forget your first."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite burrito place, period!
 
Menu: Choices for \"meat\" are plenty, including several in seafood i.e. calamari, halibut, haddock, as well as vegetarian options. Portion sizes are huge, even for the small orders. I love that you don't have to pay extra for guac too! (compared to +2$ at Chipotle, sheesh!) It's also great value - you get a HEAVY plate for under $10 (I have to use both hands to hold it).
 
Experience: I've only ever gone for takeout during weekday lunch hour, which is when it gets super packed. Getting there a bit earlier i.e. 11:45am makes a big difference in service time. Seafood tends to take longer so the cashiers will often ask in advance if anyone's ordering seafood. They make it on the spot so the fish always comes out nice and crispy. The chicken is really flavorful too and cooked well i.e. it's not dry."}
{"text":"Blech!!!!! Horrible scene at lunch time on a week day. 150 males stand around until a burrito maker yells their order number into a microphone. The cashier woman is yelling at the line up: DOES ANYONE WANT FISH? IF YOU WANT FISH TELL US NOW SO WE CAN START MAKING IT!!!!!

I ordered a large veggie soy burrito. Never seen a burrito place skimp so hard on the toppings. Was jam packed with a bunch of eerily convincing fake ground beef and I basically couldn't taste anything else. Honestly, this place is a lunch machine, not a restaurant. No care taken with the food. Couldn't taste anything except the fake meat. Yuck!!!! Pick one of the many other burrito joints nearby. 

This is a disgrace to Mexican food!"}
{"text":"My previous burrito boyz visits were to the London locations so I had high expectations. 

There were only two other people in the restaurant and the service was really quick. The staff were extremely nice, nicer than the ones in London for sure. 

I opted for a naked steak burrito (I wasn't feeling the wrap) and oh my god I found my new go to item. It was huge! The steak was perfect, the cheese ended up all melty and delicious. It was like a burrito salad almost. 

I will forever recommend burrito boyz as a quick place to grab some seriously delicious food."}
{"text":"I looooooooovvveee burrito boyz. I wish I thought of yhe idea myself. Fresh food wrapped in a big fat hot burrito *drolls*. I always drive to hurontario and dundas or lakeshore for my burritos because I am convinced they are the best locations even though I live in brampton.  Then this location opened and it was a game changer.   Now I can enjoy burrito boyz weekly! I usually order shrimp quesadillas or the shrimp and halibut burrito spicy with extra cilantro.  This is making me hungry I think I'm going to go get one now."}
{"text":"My fav burrito place. They don't charge you extra for toppings and give you small portions of meat. Flavourful and worth every dollar. Shrimp and halibut mix is my favourite."}
{"text":"Truthfully, I've never been a \"burrito\" type of person. I was working at a conference at the nearby Shangri-La hotel for 2 weeks. After a week of hotel food and expensive dinners, I decided to skip out on the formal dining, grab my boyfriend and go out for a cheap meal.

I'm a carb-avoider so what I liked about Burrito Boyz is you can order these \"plates\" that is basically a take out container with all the Burrito toppings and fillings placed into, bread free. I've had these at other places, but what I loved about Burrito Boyz is they really don't skimp on the ingredients! The amount of chicken was HUGE and authentic (not the rubbery pre-packaged type of chicken). The guacamole and every other ingredient all really fresh. 

Price is super cheap too. Cannot get over it. 2 meals including tax came to $18.

Place could deal with some additional seating but otherwise everything is muy bueno."}
{"text":"I'm honestly confused. I don't understand how this place has 4 stars. The ingredients were very fresh, which I was very happy about. However, completely flavorless. I ordered the chicken naked burrito. The guacamole didn't taste like much, rice was bland, chicken lacked flavor. Very disappointing :("}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I cannot add more than what everyone else has said about this place.

Pros:
Best burrito in Toronto in my opinion
Good selection of meats (beef, chicken, shrimp, halibut)
Biggest burrito serving
Take the time to cook it so that the outside gets a little crispy
Meat is the main ingredient
Their hot sauce is HOT. For medium spice they put on 3 or 4 drops (yes drops)

Cons:
Lineups out the door at both lunch and after a hard night of drinking
The preparation time is quite long
Small seating area
The beef can be a little fatty at times"}
{"text":"Wasn't able to eat at this location, as they  actually close at midnight on weekends, NOT 1 am, like is listed. Something to know before you drive there...and find parking.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"mexican cuisine is one of my absolute favourites.
i love all the options that are available to choose from.
i split a steak burrito and a shrimp burrito with a friend and got all toppings wild mild sauce.
i only wished that there was a bit more rice in the burritos as could only find a few grains here and there, but other wise i thought it tasted delicious. especially the shrimp, that was very good actually."}
{"text":"Always a great place to get an affordable lunch or dinner.     Made fresh to order.
There very clean  and on top of things at this place."}
{"text":"Wow, now that was a burrito! I've been here once on a quick trip to Toronto. Good anytime but ideal as late night food. There's a great range of burritos including fish and, I think, veggie options. I had a halibut burrito, after all halibut is the king of fish!

One caution, there is a hot, medium or mild option. I prevaricated between the hot and medium, but choose medium.  I'm glad I didn't choose hot because the medium made steam come out of my ears!

I'd definately go back."}
{"text":"Chipotle is over rated by far! I have dairy free and gluten free dietary restrictions and this is one of those places I can pig out no problem. Do you want to stuff your face for $7? This is where to go. 

I get a small burrito bowl with half chicken and half sweet potatoes and all the veg I can get. Even though I don't add any cheese or sour cream to my bowl, it's SO flavourful and pretty guilt free. 

Went to the movies yesterday and snuck in burrito bowls for me and my date. That's true love!"}
{"text":"Before I moved to the U.S., and before Burrito Boyz (BB) expanded and then split, this (no longer) hole-in-the-wall joint had received 5 stars from me (but that was before the Yelp days). Now that I moved back, the burritos are still good, but things have changed!

First and foremost, the prices have changed. no longer can you pay less than $5 for a burrito, which was one of the most attractive things about this place (I used to work by the distillery and my coworkers and i would trek all the way over to the west-end, line up in a dinky little place, now Burrito Bandidos, with nowhere to sit, then eat standing outside in the cold--that's a real five-star, no?)

Secondly, my burrito experience has expanded--having eaten all types of burritos in  Boston, Bay area, London, and, Paris, I have learned that a burrito does not need all the condiments (lettuce, sour cream, cheese, guac, etc.,) to be good. A real good burrito can stand on its own with beans, rice, and meat, and optional toppings. I have realized that the steak offered in the steak burrito here is actually a quite sub-par. Sliced beef in your burrito does not give the right texture nor flavour. What they need to do is up their steak into flavouful steak tips/cubes! 

Nevertheless, the burritos here, drenched in their special BB sauce is still mouth-watering. If you get any of their burritos, they will put everything on there, and the burritos becomes something quite extraordinary.

So don't expect your average typical burrito, expect to have something different and let yourself have all that they offer--and you'll love this place, like everyone else.

And be careful, their hot sauce is actually extremely spicy (woohoo!)"}
{"text":"This is such a damn good burrito, and with a snapple still for just shy of $10.  I love this place with all of my heart . . . they have opened a bunch more downtown and gta.  kudos.
the goss is that the owners parted ways, and the other has burrito banditos bloor UofT hood ... just had one of those tonight and can confirm that they are scrumptious, just as packed full of goodness.
go have a burrito already."}
{"text":"Worked here in 2006 when I was 16. Crazy summer job. Food is fresh, clean and delicious. Probably ate 3 burritos/quesadillas a shift and somehow I was in the best shape I've ever been in that summer (correlation or causation, does this mean its healthy??)

Crunch from the grill and fresh veggies. Delicious sauces. Well marinated and cooked cumbrae meats. The mexican rice is so delicious it should be tried separately. Pretty much any combination/proportion of those delicious fresh ingredients is amazing.

I miss it.

Now BBoyz and BBanditos have split the original chain, BBoys got the iconic name and Banditos got the signature creamy, chili, lime sauce."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday before going to see a movie at the Queensway cineplex, the food there is good. I ordered the small chicken burrito and it was more than I can eat. Thought the food was good, the service was, lacking, to say the least. The staff there were doing everything but providing good service. I was the only person there and it still took 15 mins to make my order. I didn't even mind the long wait time, but the unfriendliness from staff there was awkward and not welcoming at any means. Though like the food, I WON\"T be returning due to poor service. I will however, try a different location in the future."}
{"text":"Great place to go to when you have a crave for burritos during the night. Their sizes were larger than usual places that I have been to, which I believed it is worth the price. I ordered the SMALL steak burrito. 

The process goes like this... First, you order the style (burrito, burrito bowl/ NAKED burrito as they call it) and the main ingredient (steak, fish, shrimp, etc), then they will call your number written on the receipt and ask what you would like in your burrito minus the main ingredient. Afterwards, they pass your burrito to the chief at the back who's gonna but the best ingredient inside, wrap it, and rest it on the flat grill for a little bit, making it crispy. Once it is crispy enough, the chief will wrap it in a foil and put into a paper bag, then ENJOYYYYYY! 

If you aren't a big eater like me, the SMALL is well enough for you as it is the size of a MEDIUM in other places. 

The XXX hot sauce is quite hot to be honest, I shouldn't have asked for more LOL. 

P.S THE GUAC IS SO WORTH IT FOR ONLY 87 cents... they put a huge ice cream looking scoop and spread it in your burrito."}
{"text":"I am sooooooooooo glad I was able to stop here on my little stint in Toronto. As a big fan of Chipotle (or mexican food in general), I just had to give Burrito Boyz the taste test before heading back from the Caribana Parade.

The menu is extensive for a sort of fast food mexican joint. You can get either burritos or quesadillas and you have options ranging from chicken to steak to sweet potato to shrimp and more! Plus, you can mix any two. What a sweet deal.

The host could tell I wasn't familiar with the menu and she guided me through with no hesitation and even added a few suggestions of her own. They load it up with your choice of rice, bean, veggies, guac (no extra charge!), and sauces. Portions are huge and definitely worth every penny. 

Now, if only we can get them to expand over the border into New York..."}
{"text":"1 burrito will get you stuff for hours! Packed with flavour always stop by when Im near."}
{"text":"Convenient location but very slow service. Orders take over 20 min in person without line up and even longer with ritual."}
{"text":"The small is huge!! We had an order of the  halibut and the steak. The halibut was great, but the way the steak looked and tasted like almost seemed like ground beef. Which tasted good but not like steak. Overall the place is good, especially the taste and serving sizes for the prices."}
{"text":"Went in on cinco de mayo. Obviously the place was busy. The lady working the front was speaking so fast I had to ask her what she said every time she asked me if i wanted an item in my burrito. So I ordered and then sat down and waited for my number to be called. I got the burrito and even though they warm it up, the chicken was cold. I'll definitely be trying elsewhere before I go back, but if youre desperate for a burrito i guess this is the place in Woodbridge."}
{"text":"I parked outside this place one night to go clubbing, and when I returned it was gone!  It was towed away and I had to pay over $100 to get it back. 

The best part of the night was Burrito Boyz.  Me and my friends stopped by this place for Burrito's after a night of clubbing, and it made the walk to the Car impound lot a lot more satisfying.  

I recommend this for hungry people who like Burrito's late at night, or any other time of day.

{"text":"I came here with a friend yesterday after arriving from the airport. It took us a while to find it that we almost decided to eat at whichever restaurant we saw next. Anyways it was around 2ish in the afternoon, had about 5-6 customers ahead of us, so they were still busy. I had the all shrimp burrito with chips and water, while my friend had the small beef burrito with chips and coke. I felt that the shrimp needed more flavor and that they put too much refried beans and sauce that my burrito was soaked at the bottom. My friend didn't like hers enough that she'll go back and I can't say I blame her. The service could've been better, the guy who grilled my friends burrito was a bit snappy at calling out her number and when she was walking towards him, apparently he slammed her order on the counter, very rude. The cashier was nice and pleaseant. The things I liked the most was the chips, salsa, and their music, pretty, cool.

Since that my friend  and I are from Texas, we've had better burritos and felt that Burrito Boyz's could have done better. Need more flavor!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said?

Only complaint: eating in here is fairly uncomfortable, packed (not in a good way), and dark, even on sunny days. And you'd think it would make for good people watching, because there are so many people who flow through. But customers are different when they're standing waiting for food - kind of anxious, with a sense of anticipation, and watching the cooks like hawks. 

Everything else about this place is great. Highly recommended for a quick bite."}
{"text":"HALAL available. 

This location has Halal option in the chicken and it tastes pretty good. Their service is good and they don't seem to measure the food when they make your order like other locations I have seen. This is one of the better locations to visit."}
{"text":"This was my \"go-to\" spot for fast food. No matter what time of day, during lunch or coming home from a party at 1am, this was the spot that would come to mind when I wanted something to eat. I was never a burrito person let alone even knew about this place when it first opened. I only heard of this place from friends. Now I know why burrito boyz is so popular.

The burritos here are amazing! They are made fresh to order and made right in front of your eyes. I usually get the shrimp burrito but have had the fish ones as well. When they opened new, they would not measure the amount of toppings they put on the burrito. Now I have noticed that they place the burrito on a measure. That is the only reason I have given them 4 stars. I love the food and it is always cooked properly. The staff are professional but not always friendly...that depends on who you get or what time of day it is. Regardless, it is the food that matters most and that is undeniably the best."}
{"text":"I hate this location.

The cashier and the tomboy-ish girl who makes the burritos have the worst attitudes of life and  zero maturity.

This location also does not follow procedure for allergies. The downtown one is so amazing about being allergy aware and always takes the time and care to make sure they prepare the food safely. 

My past visit the tomboy wrapped up all the flour burritos then proceeded to wrap up my gf burrito with the same gloves - after I told them it was due to celiac (not a preference) and that I am very sensitive. Halfway though she realized she didn't change gloves, did a double take, looked my way to see if I had seen, and instead of being an adult and saying sorry she messed up and would have to redo the burrito, she turned her back to me and kept going, burrito already contaminated at this point. I called them out on it and instead of being mature they acted like assholes and gave me a hard time. I know that burrito boys has protocol to change gloves when handling a gluten free burrito and that they are allergy aware, She blatantly f'ked up protocol and yet decided to be too lazy and childish to correct it. She decided she would rather put someones health at risk than re-do a really basic burrito in a very empty restaurant, and then decided to be a dick about it. Childish and pathetic. 

If you are celiac or have any sort of gluten sensitivity, I would avoid this place and the terrible staff that come with is."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz is a solid place to get a burrito or quesadilla for lunch, or perhaps in the wee hours of the morning (many locations are open on Friday and Saturday until 3:30-4:00am). Depending on the time of day, the ordering process can be a bit chaotic.

Must-try items:
Naked Burritos (any choice)
Burritos (wrapped)
Quesadillas (chicken, sweet potato etc.)

The staff are normally helpful and quick, but dealing with long lineups definitely creates challenges when it comes to serving customers. It's easy to encounter some confusion at this location, considering how noisy and packed it can be at times. Environmental issues aside, the food is pretty satisfying. Portion sizes are immense for what you're charged, and they don't hold back on toppings. The nacho chips are made in house as well as the salsa and guac, which make a good side order.

Every time I've visited a Burrito Boyz, I've ended up completely stuffed to the point of being unable to move. The food is delicious and deceivingly filling, so be careful how much you eat. A small sized meal is a much safer choice than a large, in most cases. The food can easily be shared or saved for a snack of leftovers. As other reviews have mentioned, it can get pretty messy in here due to the frequency of customers, so taking your order to go might be something to consider."}
{"text":"Very tasty food for a great price. Love the naked burrito bowls, it's a generous serving that won't leave you hungry. Plus the service is usually friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Amazing burritos. These hit the spot for late night food but are also quite delicious when sober! Everything is made fresh to order, so the wait is a little long but totally worth it. 

If you are to take a burrito to go, get them to put less sauce so its not as soggy later on. A small burrito is very filling so don't waste your money on a large. They go heavy on the hot sauce so ask for little or no hot sauce if you can't handle the heat. Last tip - gets lots of napkins! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. Everything was clean. Good parking and seating. They took their time with burrito it was nice and crispy. Delicious"}

Shrimp because of the bada$$ sauce"}
{"text":"Just the best burritos. Huge portions and one of the most diverse flavour profiles - you can taste every ingredient."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I visited Burrito Boyz on my first night in Toronto largely because it was one of few sit down places open at 9:45pm on a Tuesday.  The menu is set up a lot like that of Chipotle where customers choose their meat, then the vessel (naked bowl, burrito, etc.) then the toppings and a hot, medium or mild sauce.  There  is also a choice between a small and large portion.  I chose a small chicken bowl, fully loaded, and  mild, my companion ordered the same thing but with steak.  We both found the meat to be fresh and well seasoned, but the bowls to be otherwise severely lacking in flavor.  We questioned whether the orange \"cheese\" sprinkled on top was real, as it was exceptionally bland and waxy and did not appear to melt.  We both ended up picking the meat out of the dishes and throwing the rest away.

The actual ambience was cute enough.  Rectangular gray formica tables with metallic chairs, and a 90's throwback kitsch along the walls, and the music was all 1990's rap and R&B, which was fun.  The restaurant offered no wi-fi."}
{"text":"I had a quick linch here last week, and I was very impressed.
Mexican food can be a little overpowering with taste if it's done incorrectly...but not here, everything was perfect!!
Usually at other similar places, they tend to use too much spices and flavours, but here it was done to perfection.
I ordered a naked Burrito which is bascially a burrito on a plate instead of a wrap...all portions are just right, and the flavors are in point! I had mine with beef and chicken with guacamole.
I will go back soon, and definitely try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Halibut Buritto.  Simply delicious.

The halibut is flaky and light, almost melts in your mouth.  Best burrito I've ever had."}
{"text":"Not a bad burrito but not great. The steak is sub par and too chewed.  Interesting toppings.  Good service"}
{"text":"Never getting a quesadilla here again.. very dry and stale. They forgot to add the bag of chips and a drink. Ordered 2 seperate burritos and they put whole wheat instead of white. Ordered over the phone and still had to wait 10+ minutes"}
{"text":"SO. Most already know about my dislike of Burrito Boyz (and the Banditos ugly step sister). I wasn't given the choice about coming here but I also didn't have to pay...so there's that. I figured since I was being forced to eat here I would try the halibut burrito that everyone seems to rave about. 

The fish was good. Better than the bland meat options I've tried before. However, the burrito was heavily grilled and cracked open when I still had a third of it left, leaving my hands messy and dripping of burrito sauce. 

The guy at the till was friendly and helpful. The girl making our burritos was nice but she had trouble keeping our order of three burritos straight. As I've said in a previous Boyz/Banditos review, why not make one burrito at a time and get it right? You don't see Subway trying to make three subs at the same time.

4 stars for the tasty fish
3 stars for the service
2 stars for over-grilling the burrito"}
{"text":"I guess this place goes under the bland section on my list.  The ingredients are fresh, but there's nothing out of the ordinary.  I had the steak burrito and I think they literally just cook a steak, chop it up, and put it in your burrito.  There's nothing Mexican about it, no spice, no sauce, just plain old steak.

I'm still not a fan of the grilled burritos but this was the best one I've had of the grilled variety.  What I REALLY wasn't a fan of was waiting 15 minutes after I had placed my order.  I don't mind waiting in a line to place my order, but once it's placed I should have my food quickly.  They had both stations going but not both grills so they were just creating a backlog for themselves.  Get with it and buy some panini grills and get people on their way.

The bonus for these buys is their price point.  A burrito and a bottle of water for just over $8 is a great deal!

Overall this burrito was something I could make at home.  There was no special spice blend, the salsa was out of a can, and the other toppings were just basic veggies.

Next please!"}
{"text":"I am sorry I cannot give a higher rating as the place looks super nice and the service was really nice.  The burritos were good sized and there was a lot of fillings to choose from.  Sadly, there was no flavour!  It was the blandest burrito I have ever eaten.  I was disappointed.  I even asked from the hotter sauce but all I tasted was heat and not flavour.  

Hopefully this place will find it's stride and the food will get tastier but there are many other places to check out and I will be going elsewhere in the meantime.

Burrito Boys, if you read this, please let me know if you have made improvements on the menu and I will try you again."}
{"text":"It's filling, I tried the fish and the chicken mixed with steak one and they were all good. I would say it's more of a 3 and a half but because it is open late I am giving it 4 stars. The food isn't bad but it isn't the best but I kinda like it."}
{"text":"Picture this: me, 8 days into my Toronto trip, 6 hours before my flight is set to leave back home. For the past 8 days, I have consumed at least 3500 calories a day (being short, female, and not a general peruser of gyms, this is about 2500 calories past my daily needed limit). I can barely fit into my clothes. I am briefly considering going to the mall and buying a pair of looser sweatpants to wear for my flight.

(after eating a hearty Korean meal for breakfast)
Friend: Where do you want to eat for lunch today?
Me: I'm really not hungry.
Friend: Are you sure?
Me: I don't think there's any more room inside of me for food.
Friend: Are you sure you don't want to bring some take out to eat on your flight? I know a really good burrito place!
Me: OOH, BURRITOS????

Best burrito decision ever.

Four hours later, I was at the airport, waiting at the terminal for my flight, and I thought, \"Hey, I'm not feeling completely stuffed to the gills anymore. Why not take a couple bites of my burrito?\" and unveiled my holy burrito from Burrito Boyz. It was like, the size of a football, and filled with the most delicious, fresh, tasty ingredients, and heavenly, flavorful, succulent shrimp. Even though my Canadian friend was disappointed I wouldn't get to eat the burrito after it was freshly prepared and hot, by the time I ate it, everything was saturated in its own juices (sorry if that sounds gross), including the tortilla. WHICH IS HOW I LOVE MY BURRITOS. 

Needless to say, I ate the whole damn thing in 5 minutes. I am going to pretend that the looks I got from passing strangers were from rampant jealousy and not because I had delicious burrito innards smeared all over my face as I devoured the thing. No regrets.

(P.S. The only thing that made me sad about my Burrito Boyz experience is that when I was ordering my food, the girl behind the counter asked me what veggies I wanted in my burrito. I said, \"Everything but the bell peppers, please.\" She was like, \"What?\" 

Me: \"No bell peppers.\" 
Her: \"I don't know what bell peppers are.\" 
My Canadian friend: \"She means no green peppers.\" 

HELP! :( I'm a useless American who says bell peppers.)"}
{"text":"Coming here sober on a Wednesday afternoon, I have to say I'm quite disappointed.

I had the fish burrito, there was more deep-fried batter than fish. I guess for fast food, it beats having mcdonald's"}
{"text":"Its filling, and it's great for the price.

HOWEVER, the amount they give you really depends on the person. Recently, I've been to it when the Asian girl puts the toppings on, and she does not put a lot of toppings on. And when I ask for extra, she puts less toppings during her first scoop, and then adds another tiny bit so it ends up being about a scoop. I also realized that the presentation of the food she makes really depends on the customer. She did it much more precisely when an older customer in a suit came. Unfortunately, for us, my friend and I went right after a workout so our dish was more rushed and sloppier. I miss the other guys that topped my naked bowl.

(I want to give it a 3.5/5 but I can't so I decided to go with a 4/5 since they're usually great)"}
{"text":"It is a little unfair for me to write a review based on my experience of Burrito Boyz based on a Vegetarian Burrito.

Yes, I am eating a Veggie Soy Burrito. Personally I would prefer and expect to just veggie inside with beans, rice and cheese. But inside there are ground meat taste and look alike inside.. I got a little confused because my dinner mate is a vegetarian and seriously she would not be sharing a ground beef burrito with me??!!

I do find the Burrito a little bit too heavy, too saucy, too creamy?... I did not feel healthy eat this veggie burrito... But veggie choice doesn't equal healthy or light.. just the idea that no animals was harmed or killed because of my dinner..

The service here is nice and friendly. And it is open till 4 AM on weekend! Great to have a quick bite after partying in the area!"}
{"text":"I live in the area so this is the location closest to me. I used to go to the Brampton location, and I have been to the Lakeshore location. Of the three, this one is not the best. There are a couple girls behind the counter who are super nice and there are a couple who are just plain unfriendly. I found the Lakeshore location was more friendly overall, and they put plenty of cheese, and guac on your burrito. At the Streetsville location, they put a teeny tiny half of a handful of cheese on there, and then dump a HUGE handful of lettuce- I always pay for the extra guac where I don't have to do that at the other locations. They put the equivalent of a tablespoon of rice, which is not enough, and spread the beans on very very thin- and maybe a teaspoon of guac if that. This place is not hurting for business, they need to be a bit more generous with their portions like the other locations. And they really need to turn down the music, it is on blast all the time (dub step garbage) and it's hard to communicate with the staff. When the girl has to say \"pardon\" three times and I have to yell at her, that's not good.
BUT at the end of the day, I go here because I love the food. If the Lakeshore location was closer, however, I would go there instead."}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz makes life better. I've walked through two feet of snow to get burritos from here (I wish I was joking). But there is a reason they are loved by so many.

Their burritos are the perfect mix of delicious, guacamole-filled heaven, with a crispy tortilla outside. You can pick whichever toppings you want to stuff them with. I'm a fan of the jalapenos or hot sauce -- but never together, my mouth has been on fire a couple times from that experience. They're grilled into a perfect little rectangle that kind of helps to prevent the huge mess that comes with burrito-eating. And a small one is about $7...not bad for a whole meal that you can fit in a tiny brown bag.

As everyone's said, lunchtime is CRAZY at both locations. They're right in the business district, not to mention steps away from tourist-y Queen St., so they experience a bit of an insane rush around noon. But it's so worth it. I haven't ventured away from chicken or veggie, but I've never heard a bad thing about this place. So you should probably go there...right now!"}
{"text":"Ok all jokes aside I have a very serious bone to pick with Burrito Boyz--but first I'll review.

This place is great. The veggies are always SO fresh and their portion sizes are generous for the price. My go to order is the Naked burrito (bowl instead of tortilla) with Chicken & extra cilantro. I've probably been to this particular burrito boyz nearly a dozen times over the years. You should definitely give it a try if you haven't already.

OK NOW FOR MY ISSUE.

I order my usual. She asks if I want guac- I say yes. she punches in an extra charge on the register. After asking why because i didn't ask for EXTRA guac I just asked for it to come with guac which was always standard, she continues to inform me that GUAC NOW COSTS MONEY AND IS NOT INCLUDED..
..
..
..

Why on earth would you do this to us Burrito Boyz? Why are you playing us like that? How could you stoop to such a level? Guacamole is essential to the Burrito process and I know you know this because it was always included before! Don't go around acting like guac isn't included in literally every burrito place known to man kind. Don't act like we're not good enough for your avocados. We ARE good enough for your avocados. At $10/burrito that bad boy should be filled to the goddamn edges with guacamole. I should be drowning in it. Now you act like its just run of the mill to take $0.87 from us like that? Thats not cool man. Definitely not a bro move. All these years I come to you in my time of need on a hungover Sunday, wanting nothing more than to let your heavenly creations save my battered weakened body only for you to think Im some kind of millionaire with an extra 87 cents lying around for your avocado mash? That ain't right. Our deal is: I give you $10, you cure my hangover--GUAC INCLUDED. 

Low blow Burrito Boyz. Low blow."}
{"text":"Really overrated. I hadn't been here in two years and went for lunch today -- now I remember why I didn't bother. They are really stingy with toppings. I think I could count on one hand the number of tiny black beans the woman behind the counter put on my burrito. The guacamole is an unappealing shade of grey/green and looks too smooth and uniform in texture; that said, I couldn't really taste it as I was barely given any. The rice is bland and dry. The red salsa looks and tastes like something from an Old El Paso container. Only the halibut, which seemed quite fresh, and the somewhat spicy hot sauce saved this. Honestly, would rather go to Chipotle - for the same price, at least they really stuff the burrito and the ingredients aren't any less fresh.

Toronto's burrito/Mexican scene is pathetic, but I'm not surprised that all the 905ers who crowd this place on weekends don't know any better."}
{"text":"This is the best location of its chain  in the GTA. I lived in Mississauga for 19 years and tried Burrito Boyz at both locations there (Streetsville and WC), also been many times to the Brampton Queen St location, but Queensway beats them all hands down!  Ingredients are fresh and all the protein choices are available! Best of all every employee there is a gem. They are always smiling, quick and efficient which helps when waiting for your order as no matter what time of day or night this place is always busy non stop! If you like fish, try the halibut grilled. Even better mix it up with shrimp! Yum!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is all about.  Burritos are bland.  Price is not bad.  Fresh ingredients make up for the lack of taste.  Good hot sauce."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years. It is always my first meal when I return home to Port Credit. Fantastic selection - something to please everyone and completely customized. Delicious. Probably my favourite spot in the area. However - extremely limited seating (especially in the winter), so plan on take-out."}
{"text":"I ventured here when they first opened up and upon their recommendation I got the quesadilla.  I was so glad I did, because when I got the burrito the next time it wasn't very good.  Quesadilla is awesome especially with the sides you get to complement it.  If you like a sauce with a slight kick then get the burrito sauce.
Burritos are average.  I definitely have had better that were better tasting.  These are a bit more on the bland side.
The place is new and clean - definitely not like the other run down burrito joints I've seen before.  Manager was a champ who walked us through things and set us up with a few extra sides to try.
I'd come back here for the great service and cause I'm a stickler for their quesadillas."}
{"text":"Food took very long to receive and was very messy. Don't recommend eating this on the go! The flavours were decent, nothing you couldn't make at home."}
{"text":"Always reliable, always fresh ingredients, never have to wait longer than 15 minutes. What more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"Burrito Boyz used to be my burrito of choice back when I was studying. I was glad to see this nearby from my work from the Grabb app. With Chipotle being in the spotlight and close by it's easy to miss this joint which is a little walk east from Yonge and Dundas.

Food
Must try their fish burrito! I really like their haddock version which is a bit cheaper and I think comparable to the halibut. 

Service
I ordered from my grabb app which allows me to skip the line and have it prepared in advance to pick up. (FYI Use promo code GW2AI for $5 off food/drink when you order). I arrived maybe around 15 mins after I ordered. I realize they STILL haven't even prepared my food yet. Apparently the manager explained that they normally prepare the burrito bowls without a wrap once you arrive because it prevents it from being cold. This defeats the purpose of ordering from the app. They haven't even put the fish in the fryer yet when I arrived. They should at least have the toppings ready to be assembled. Manager said for next time to leave a comment on the order to say that you want it ready for pick up. This certainly doesn't need to be stated in any other restaurant when I order from Grabb, it's expected. I have a feeling they were just busy and forgot to start on my order earlier. 

Environment 
No seating, small take out joint. But if you need a seat, there are neighbouring food courts you can hit up after you order. 

Overall 
I like it better than Chipotle because it's tastier and is has fish option, which I find taste better than the meat. Beware when you're ordering the no wrap from a take out app -You have to explicitly state that it should be ready for take out or expect to wait another 10 mins or so. A little annoying when you're hungry and tight on time."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! I had the large steak taco with guacamole for roughly $12. 
The atmosphere is great, lots of seating & food is definitely fresh to order. A steady flow of people going through is a testament to the popularity and based on my meal it is justified. 
I'll be back"}
{"text":"It was good but not great.   I had the Haddock and shrimp combo burrito.   Got not nearly enough of either!   Haddock had no flavour at all.   Disappointing overall.   Although I've had the steak burrito and it was much better!"}
{"text":"I'm from the States. I grew up in Los Angeles and am somewhat of a burrito snob. But, this was a pretty good burrito. The preparation was completely backward. Everything is put together cold and then put on a hot grill. It's nice to have the cheese completely melted, but properly cooked meat can achieve that effect if done correctly. That being said, the chicken in my burrito wasn't of the highest quality. Aside from that complaint, the burrito was solid. 

It was a pretty good tasting burrito. They put some sauce in it... they called it \"burrito sauce\". I think it's some sort of variant of mayonnaise or sour cream. I was super skeptical, but it was a good addition that I recommend. 

As said before, the saving grace of this place: $6 for a large burrito."}
{"text":"Amazing Burrito's !! I have never had anything like what I ate. I ordered a large steak burrito because I thought that a small just wouldnt cut it. Well the large weighs like 5 pounds !!  I asked for some of the hot sauce jalapenos and all. It was just enough kick without being too hot. After I ate all I wanted to do was sleep. The enviroment was my only issue. The music inside was so loud I couldnt even yell out my order. We had to wait outside because the dance music that was playing was just too loud. All in all the food was amazing and I will go back again. 

They dont accept debit ..however they do have a bank machine inside the store.

The only issues I have had is that I have been to Burrito Boyz probably 10 times. Every time I have gone and ordered the same Burrito and it has tasted differently. 1 of the times I ordered my steak Burrito and when I got home to eat it there was no steak. I called them and the next time I came in they gave me a free Burrito. The last Burrito I had from them for some reason tasted like less meat and too much beans. Burrito Boyz is great like a Mcdonalds of Mexican food, however El Sombrero for a little more money tastes much better and you get the same exact taste every time."}
{"text":"Not your traditional burrito (like we get in Southern California), but it has all the right elements. I had a Tequila Lime Chicken Burrito and it's kind of a build your own burrito once you chose the primary ingredients. I had mine with refried beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, cilantro, salsa, and sour cream. My burrito was bursting with flavor and I definitely enjoyed it. $12+ with a soda, but worth it."}
{"text":"My first time here.   I thoroughly enjoyed enjoyed it!! Loved all the veggie options and fair price point.  The service was great, I asked lots of questions and they were very polite.  Was happy to learn they deliver thru \"skip the dishes\"
Will def go back or order again soon!! Yum"}
{"text":"Are you kidding, I love this place!  They have a nice variety of burritos which includes fish, veggie, soy meat, pork, chicken, shrimp and beef.  The toppings are plentiful and include cilantro, green onions, red onion, tomatoes, lettuce, Burrito Boyz sauce, among others.  The service is friendly, but you will wait for your burrito.  The reason for this is because unlike most burrito places, they slowly grill both sides to give the tortilla a nice crispy texture.  For the price you will be full.  Burrios come in two sizes, regular and large, and I would only recommend the large if youre REALLY hungry.  It just has more inside.

There are several locations, but for some reason this one is my favorite one.  there is also a Burrito Boyz card, which is convenient to use, re loadable, and gives you a 5% discount every time you reload it."}
{"text":"I've been to other Burrito Boyz locations and this one was every bit as good!  Fresh ingredients, good choices, and a sparkling clean restaurant.  This is not Fat Bastard, get over it."}
{"text":"We need this in Miami! So good and tasted super fresh! Will go back again before I leave home"}
{"text":"Bottom line, its barely ok for fast food, and its not exactly a deal, unless you are looking for two days worth of food in one sitting...  If there are seats at Utopia across the road I'd much rather go there for a burger.

I've had about 5 burritos in my life, but since this place just opened and its around the corner from me, I thought I'd give it a shot, given the number of reviews on other locations.  

Steak burrito is $8.00.  About a dollar less for a small.  I ordered large... appeared to put a reasonable amount of steak in the burrito.  Tastiness was ok for fast food.  Lots of different toppings.  Since I brought it home I thought I'd weigh it since I had a scale out... The large topped out at 580 grams and that was going easy on beans and rice.

About 8 different kinds of burritos and about 6 different kinds of quesadillas.  That's pretty much all I saw on the massively sized menu that was posted on the wall.  Vivek will be pleased to know that the menu readability is excellent.  

Service was fine and fast, there were only a couple of other people there.  One thing that is cool is when they take your order they have a screen facing you that shows you what you've ordered as you go... like when you check out of most chain grocery stores.  There are about.  10 spots to sit."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 - Huge, filling, tasty burritos. Large enough for 2 ppl
 
Service 4/5 - quick, knowledgeable, friendly. During lunch time need to ways 10 min for the order to be ready. 
TV, inside seats, ATM. Debit cards!

Price 4/5 - $5 (small burrito + pop) for student deal! its more than enough 

Will be Back!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of burrito boyz so I'm glad this opened up since it's closer to my home.  I only get the halibut burrito.  I took my family there and they all loved it."}
{"text":"Literally the best take-out I've had.  I'm on the verge of joyful tears just thinking about it.  Great, well-cooked meats.  Vegetarian options and even a new sweet potato option!  The toppings are amazing, especially the Burrito Boyz sauce, guacamole and sour cream."}
{"text":"I love the burrito boyz on Lakeshore and didn't think that other locations would be any different. WRONG.

This location is just downright awful. Between the hair in my quesadilla and the overly greased quesadillas that become soggy and uneatable, I'm not sure what is worst.

I decided to go with my boyfriend to this location once as we are no strangers to College Street or Burrito Boyz. I wanted him to try the steak and chicken mix that I had on lakeshore because I couldn't get over how delicious it was.

Boy do I ever regret stepping foot in there. It was dirty, quesadilla was DRIPPING with grease and wasn't even properly padded it down. 

Never ever ever going back. What a disgrace to the name."}
{"text":"Hands down the best location. I always get the chicken quesadilla and it doesn't matter who makes it, it's always delicious, padded down nice and done right. I decided one day to be more \"Adventurous\" and try the steak and chicken quesadilla. BEST CHOICE OF LIFE. It was beyond any expectations that I had.

The staff are quick, friendly and serve up a mean burrito or quesadilla. After having horrific experiences at other Burrito Boyz across town, I make it known to only come to this location."}
{"text":"Came here the other day for lunch. I've been to burrito boyz before, however I usually go to the Scarborough location.

I got the chicken burrito and it was amazing. Hands down, burrito boyz has the best burritos I've tried so far. They fill it up, especially with meat.

However, 4 stars only because the service was pretty slow. The line wasn't that huge, however it was still slow, despite the fact that there were about 6 people working."}
{"text":"Great burrito for a very affordable price! if you are not starving, order small size because their large is REALLY large. Small sitting area and parking can be hard to find. Restaurant stays open until late and servers are upbit & friendly! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"As good as ever but I wish they offered delivery during lunch rush. I find they tend to give more toppings for their naked bowl rather than the burrito wrap."}
{"text":"They have shrimp and fish options and a real amazing spicy sauce. The ingredients are fresh. I've seen the preparers using gloves and changing them too. The quality and quantity are great. Gluten-free, bowl options available. All in all great fast food!"}
{"text":"Love this place. This is where I get my burrito fix from steak to seafood. A popular spot in the tdot and everyone must try this at least once =)"}
{"text":"Homeboy in the back making burritos like he's a regular old Chef Boyz R Deez not that good burritos. They do a better job standing around with attitude than making food."}
{"text":"Hello Everyone! 

First time i've tried this place. I wasn't sure i'd like it. I thought it would have been another mexican restaurant but i was sure wrong about that. This place is AMAZING!! I really liked the Shrimp and Halibut burrito that my boyfriend and i had. I will totally recommend coming here and totally coming back here again!!

HUGE THANK YOU! to BURRITO BOYZ"}
{"text":"always good and plentiful portions, quality ingredients and great prices! always order naked chicken burrito bowl no rice :D"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I leave burrito boyz. I wish there was an option for 4.5 because this place is nearly perfect, my lone complaint being consistency. Sometimes I have a burrito that absolutely blows my mind, while other times I have one that leaves a lot to the imagination. 

However, I will always remain a fan and the good experiences vastly outnumber the bad. 

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Consistently great at this location! The service is really fast and friendly and its never too busy like some of the other locations in the city. Prices are always great at any Burrito Boyz and the taste is consistent with all the others! 

I really wish more of these chains would pop up as opposed to some of the other burrito chains in the GTA

5/5!"}
{"text":"It's our first time going to this place and there's almost nothing open at 12:30am and it's surprisingly, incredibly good! We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Customer service is lacking tremendously.  Waited 15 minutes for our burritos and there were on 3 customers in the store at the time.  The burrito was pretty good but not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I give it a one solely on the burrito. The customer service was absolutely garbage. When I arrived there was no line and a lady (who was the only kind one) made my burrito. I thought it was strange that I didn't have to pay first but whatever.  I waited 5 minutes for the avocado to be made, which is no problem. Once the avocado was finally ready, nobody went to put my avocado on my burrito. It became super busy and I couldn't get a workers attention. So, for about 5 minutes workers were working around my open burrito. I go to a lady making another customers burrito and I ask if they could put the avocado in my burrito. so it can be ready in 5-10 minutes while I go and pay. She snaps and tells me that I have to pay first to complete the process, which was bullshit because that wasn't the case for anyone else and not one worker told me that. I go back in line now to wait another 5 minutes to pay for a burrito that's been sitting there for 10 minutes. So basically, 30 minutes for one burrito. Go to fat bastards across the street! Free guac and common sense!"}
{"text":"Prices are good, and so is the food! I got half chicken half steak burrito and it was really nice! Be careful if you ask for spicy it was good for me but the 2 friends I was with couldn't handle it!"}
{"text":"Last week, I walked by the front entrance around lunch time, and there were several customers eating their burritos right on the sidewalk, as if they couldn't wait to eat them! As I had just had my lunch, I came back today to give it a try.  I ordered a small steak burrito.  I had everything except beans and rice, because I wanted to taste the meat and other toppings without feeling bloated afterwards.  It was still very filling without them.

I was really pleased by the quality and freshness of the steak and veggies.  Steak was tender and full of flavour.  I rarely come across cilantro as fresh as this was.  You can get extra guacamole free of charge (not like some other places).

The biggest test -I enjoyed every bite from beginning to end.  The staff were also very friendly and service was fast.  I noticed that several customers who had placed their orders online had their food ready when they arrived."}
{"text":"Best burrito franchise out there. I like this particular spot because it near my school. I have to say that the girl that wrap my burrito was exceptionally hot. I'll go soon that ask her if she wants to put a wrap on my extra big burrito."}
{"text":"First off, let's get one thing straight. This isn't an authentic Mexican burrito. I haven't found anything that close to what I've had down south.

Second, they know what they are doing here. If you eat meat, the fish burrito's are pretty darn good. I'd pick the fish over the meat here, infact I'd take the bean and cheese over the meat, and I love my meat.

Good spot, but a far cry from Mexican."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Burrito Boyz and go there once or twice a week for lunch, but unfortunately I had a particularly vicious (and confirmed) case of food poisoning from and haven't returned since. 

Their burritos are tasty and affordable but unfortunately the indigestion you suffer from afterwards isn't worth the trouble."}
{"text":"Great location!  Consistently good and in line with other the quality of other locations.  Loved the hours of operation.  Always pre-order.  Nice and busy locations which is an added benefit of fresh ingredients all the time.  Nice and fast staff - my goto quick healthy meal."}
{"text":"After going out late and this restaurant was in the area, we decided to check out this place since it was so highly praised. At first when I enter he establishment it was great, everything looked clean and kind of gives you a subway vibe. After placing my order of steak and sweet potatoes, I was not amused.

They loaded up on lettuce and barely any other vegetables, I asked for mild and they only provided a few micro cuts of japelnos. They provide guacamole free of charge but only a spoon size amount. I asked for more but they said it would cost extra. 

At the end, when I got home to eat, I saw the biggest surprise of my life. The meat had a distasteful colour and it didn't taste marinated at all. The sauces did mix very nicely together. 

Overall I'm very disappointed and I definitely would choose chipotle which is right around the corner."}
{"text":"How can you be a restaurant and have your bathroom out of order for over a year? Shame on you stingy people. Food tastes like bland mush in a wrap unless you get jalepenos and hot sauce. Most people working their is high af. They have one slab that is broken into 3 pieces to cross over from the parking lot or you can choose to walk in the mud."}
{"text":"Best burrito joint in the GTA. Burritos are enormous and made with the freshest ingredients. I love the burritos, but lately I've been ordering the steak quesadilla which is equally delicious. Expect lines around the peak times like lunch time during the week and dinner times and late night after the bars get out."}
{"text":"First time trying Burrito Boyz ever and first time trying a burrito! I'm a huge fan of Mexican food, but never really understand the difference between tacos, burritos, fajitas etc. until I actually ordered a burrito!

I got a small burrito and it was HEAAAAVY! It was jam packed with a lot of toppings, flavours and freshness! I could taste fresh tomatoes, guacamole and a ton of nice warm flavours from the beans & steak. I surprisingly finished the whole thing in one sitting, and was stuffed for hours. Burrito Boyz did not disappoint me one bit!

I wish I took a photo of my burrito, it was amazing! I'd definitely come back.. Actually writing this review is making me want another burrito LOL."}
{"text":"Ate my food before I could take a photo. It was pretty good. I gave it 4 stars because I reserve the last one for when I'm wowed. 

Service was great and food was good and well priced. I'd eat here again. 

Im not much of a burrito person so take that into consideration. 

I had a chicken and steak burrito. 

Son had nachos. He wasn't happy he added beans to his but I thought it tasted good. Lol"}
{"text":"Mexican food is my absolute favourite! I could eat it daily and not get bored of it! This place was the first burrito/Mexican place I had been to since moving to the area and oh my word! My regular sized burrito was the size of my head (and I don't have a small head) I couldn't even finish it. It was delicious! Their burrito bowls are also amazing and leaves you feeling full for what feels like days. You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"First time here, and was not disappointed!  Got the steak burrito with the works.  Thing has to be about a pound once you get it.  Very filling, with fresh quality ingredients for about $10.  Homemade guacamole and hot sauce too.  Looking to go back sometime to try one of the Halibut burritos!
Value plus!"}
{"text":"The infamous Burrito Boyz, now who hasn't been to burrito boyz? A popular spot for those late night stops may it be after clubbing or you've been \"studying\" and you've got the munchies. Either way, it packs a crowd so you may wonder, is the hype valid?

burrito boyz has expanded to a number of locations and the most popular one is situated on Adeladie Street West. This location is pretty popular most hours of the day but veryyy busy at lunch, dinner and late at night. So it may not be the best choice if you're looking for a quick bite.

I come here occasionally whenever I'm in the area as I like their taste and it fills you up. On this particular occasion, I came here after church with a friend as we were both feeling burritos. I always order the large chicken burrito and the Jumex strawberry banana drink.  I had it made with everything except for jalapenos and just a little bit of hot sauce. The order takes about 10 mins to be made and seating is pretty sparse.  We got lucky and were able to grab some seats. But if you ever head there with good weather, many people decide to have it to go and vulture around outside enjoying their burrito.

The burrito is done well with a fair amount of meat and the toppings compliment the burrito well.  Being a saucy guy, sometimes it may be just slightly dry but for most people it shouldn't be a problem.  You can always ask for extra sauce but beware as the sauce moves down the end of the burrito and it can easily become a messy experience.  The guacamole was fresh and tasted great. They do grill your burrito but on this occasion, I felt like it could have stayed on grill just a little bit longer.  My friend got her steak burrito and commented how she felt it was a little dry. I've always ordered the chicken so I can't really comment in that regards. But she did say she enjoyed it and man was it filling.

Overall, I like burrito boyz. I mean I do find the quality dropping a little over the years and the prices increasing but I still prefer this place over many other options.  I come here knowing exactly what I'll get and I got exactly what I wanted. A good burrito that's not expensive and knowing that I'll be leaving full. Until I find a better burrito joint that will give me fresh topping, not break the bank, fill me and gives me a great taste, I'll be coming back to Burrito Boyz for more."}
{"text":"Enjoyable burrito for a good price.

For my first time here, I ordered a small bean & cheese burrito, which came to only $5.50 after tax, and it's a sizeable serving.

All the ingredients are very fresh, and it's grilled after you order to give it a nice crisp char. (This adds about 10 minutes of wait time).

I did find it a little bland for taste, but it might be my lack of familiarity with which sauces add more taste. The beans also taste a bit overcooked.

There are also very few seats (about 20 seats in total, over about 8 tables), which might make it a bit hard to eat in during the winter."}
{"text":"Best burrito I've ever had hands down. The price is very fair given the size of these things. A small is HUGE! You can mix two options for no extra charge (chicken and beef for example), and the people that work there are extremely friendly. 

I like that they don't skimp on any of the fillings. I was there when a girl was training, and her co worker kept showing her to put MORE into the burrito, which made me feel really good  that they actually care to make their customers happy. They toast the burritos a little to get everything warm and it makes it a lot better. 

The fish burrito is also delicious!

New fan of burrito boys since moving to the area. It's open late, it's cheap, you get a burrito that could make 2 meals, and it's delicious. You won't be disappointed. 

Update: had their bean and cheese burrito and wasn't as big a fan. Still good, but it was definitely missing something."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally got the chance to try Burrito Boyz after hearing a lot of rave reviews from friends.  Overall we were impressed with the quantity of the fresh ingredients given in the large chicken burritos we ordered.  The taste was fairly decent but I think it would have been almost perfect had the chicken been properly seasoned and salted.  I highly suggest the chain offer to add a salt & pepper blend (like Subway offers) before the burrito is closed up for those that want a little more seasoning."}
{"text":"I really didn't think that it could get any better then the BurritoBoyz in Port Credit, but apparently I was wrong. Because out of whatever reason these taste even better!! So if you should ever be in the area or have a craving after 9 or 10pm ( that's when the other location closes ) come here. They are open until 3 - 4am over the weekend!! 
I got here the other night after midnight and this place was packed, seems to be a popular hangout spot. As always your best bet is to pre-order and then just come pick it up."}
{"text":"This is where you can get the best burrito in the entire GTA, hands down!! Only con I would say is the long line up, but the trick there is to just call ahead that way u just wait in line to pay and then you walk out with your Burrito ( never fail to get some evil looks from people that have to wait for their burrito to still be made after they paid ). 
Plus the Burritos are huge!!! So u definitely are getting an amazing deal here."}
{"text":"Well decided to try the infamous halibut burrito. My verdict? It is the best burrito I ever had, but I guess I just don't like burritos nor halibut.  I also think the halibut had barely any taste coming out of it and the texture was meh.

So I think if I ever go back here I would just stick to my favorite dish that is shrimp quesadilla."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location since it's opened and I've never had an experience like the one I had on Wednesday evening. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars and not 1 star is because I reveieved a call from the store manager, Michael, shortly after the incident. I placed an order on thr burrito boyz app and went to pickup my order. Coincidentally my order was being made by the employee when I walked in. I saw my husband's name and watched in horror as my order was being made incorrect. When I pointed out the error I was met with complete disrespect and ignored. She out very little cheese (not the norm) the added green peppers which was not on the order and ONE LINE of hot sauce instead of one dot. My tolerence for spice is extremely low so I questioned her and was again ignored. Another server offered to make my order and she was pleasant and made it correctly. However, I had to wait an additional 15 mins after it was given to be grilled and could only assume the previous employee had something to do with that. I threw out the burrito because I didn't trust the food that was given to me. I didn't know what could have been done to it. After my phone call with the manager I was assured that was not the case and invited back to the location so they can make it up to us. I will update everyone after I return and we will see if this rating will be updated based on my next experience."}
{"text":"When it comes to junk food, I'm usually quite loyal to the big Ps, pizza and poutine. Yesterday, though, I had a hankering for a burrito. Honestly, nothing else would do, so at 9pm I scrolled all of my gimme.food.com apps, and joyfully discovered Burrito Boyz on Colllege is in my delivery zone on JustEat.

I ordered the best order. A small chicken burrito, medium spice, with everything and extra cheese. It was perfection. Absolute fucking perfection. Some people, like my know-it-all husband from California (via Indiana, sigh) go on and on about the lack of good Mexican in Toronto, but whatever. I'm not sure the authenticity level the Boyz dole out, but I am sure I love it."}
{"text":"What more needs to be said about Burrito Boyz other then the fact that they have by far the best Burrito that I have ever had.
I try to keep myself from eating them too often but so far I have been very unsuccessful at that. 
For anybody that enjoys a good burrito this place is a must try."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe it's been over a year since I last had a burrito from Burrito Boyz. Last time I apparently gave them a 3.5/5, today I give them a 2.5.

Today I decided to go for the small shrimp burrito which cost me $8. All I gotta say is that $8 for a burrito that is lacking shrimp is VERY disappointing. There was a max of 4 shrimps that I saw in the burrito and they weren't 4 full shrimps either. They were 4 cut up pieces of shrimp. I would definitely not get their shrimp burrito anymore because it's definitely NOT worth it. They definitely cheaped out on the shrimps.

Overall, service was good but Burrito Boyz is not known for their service...it's about their burritos. Now add in some more shrimp next time please!"}
{"text":"Very nice mexican fast food, I mean there are so many places doing this type of made to order in front of you mexican now that it takes a lot to stand out.
They have haddock as a protein option which is a new one for me and what tasted like quality ingredients. This pulled my burrito up above the rather bland Chipotle copycats which is great giving the strong flavours that should be present in any true mexican dish."}
{"text":"Had the steak burrito on whole wheat... Meat was not steak, it was ground (some sort of) meat, very dry and over seasoned...  Toppings are ok, no extra charge for guac, but I'd rather pay extra to actually get some guac on my burrito... Hot sauce is far from hot.  Two stars are for the staff, I may just come back to try a been and cheese burrito."}
{"text":"Some people swear by BBoyz to get they're pico de gallo cravings under control.  I've never really been to one since they are not anywhere near where I live but I happened to be working out of a remote office and drove past this place.  My inner chihuahua went Yelp!
I got a large chicken burrito, some nachos and salsa and a drink.
The main differentiator for BBoyz is they have a major smattering of toppings and they grill it - when compared to Chipotle.
I really liked the gal that was prepping the burrito.  If you ask for mild, she carefully places one small dab from the squirt bottle of hot sauce.  If you get medium, it's three dabs and I did not venture to even see what hot would be.  I got mine medium and it was more than enough.
The burrito was large and filling, however, I really did not enjoy the chicken.  It was kind of mushy and had no substance and flavour.  Also, they kind of over grilled my order and it was charcoal on one side.
Should always check before taking your take out!  Oh...the nachos and dip was ok - not anything I can't scoop out of a bag of Tostitos.
All in all, not the best first impression.  Maybe I should try something different if I go back."}
{"text":"Standard delicious burrito.  One of my top 3 goto places (next to chipotle, and el sombrero) Love the fish selection here.  Well priced for a lot of food. 

There's also a black girl that works here putting these burritos together.  Ask her for everything on your order, and watch her go.  Don't blink cause she is freakin FAST!  Bam! bam! bam! burrito perfection!  A wizard works here, I tell ya.  Watch for her."}
{"text":"Standard burrito joint. Best food size/weight to cost ratio, therefore above average \"bang for your buck\". Offers a gluten-free option. Good selection of toppings and sauces. Cant go wrong with their hot sauce. The biggest advantage is location and the fact its open late."}
{"text":"nothing different from any other burrito boyz, however very very happy with the service, the actual kitchen part was too warm so we decided to wait outside until our food was done, and one of the cooks came out with our order. 
Very impressed"}
{"text":"awesome place to get a kick-ass burrito, being a huge eater a large burrito fills me right up. 
awesome qualitity, awesome servings, awesome price, awesome flavors 
i recommend the shrimp everytime, the fish combo's are good as well 
the hot sauce is actually hot, try not to put too much on. 
my only complaint is the Guac...its consistency is not always on par."}
{"text":"i cannot fathom how fat bastard is still in business, SERIOUSLY. 
burrito boyz has always been a benchmark for burritos ever since ive been introduced to them in college, i literally could eat it every day. this location used to be super tiny, but they have since bought out one of the stores beside which has lead to an expansion which makes for ample seating, parking on the other hand is a nightmare, if you dont find parking directly in the lot, down the street has quite a few spots. the staff are amazing and friendly. 
i love living close to a burrito boyz :) makes leaving my apartment worth it"}
{"text":"like the other establishments, this one goes above and beyond, in a somewhat awkward location, great service, great food, and a very clean restaurant makes this as great as any other burrito boyz. this location has absolutely no direct parking options(so far as street access) there are quite a few lots within walking distance. transit wise, this location almost acts as a hub for the west end, or a transfer point? SEE WHAT I DID THERE? I only have one complaint which is that the hours during the week, they are not open long enough, which is frustrating because with how many short turns you have, who wants to go to mcds? AM I RIGHT? 
I love this location, just wish I was able to take advantage of it more often."}
{"text":"man...am I glad that burrito boyz is in Brampton, I've been coming to this location since the first week that it opened, and I would like to say that consistency is the biggest key with any of the burrito boyz, if you are placing the order in advanced, or just picking up, this is a great place to pick up lunch or dinner. don't even bother with the tiny parking at the store front, park in the beer store lot instead, you might get some dirty looks, but you will have Burritos! that is what matters. the staff here are super quick and extremely efficient. a great location for some food, like most burrito boys, this location doesn't have any tables to sit at, so take out is the best option or eat in your vehicle."}
{"text":"Great burritos! A lot of toppings. Haven't been there for a few years and their menu has expanded giving a lot of seafood options like halibut, shrimp and calamari. I had the steak and chicken mixed burrito while my husband had chicken. He asked for only rice and cheese but got a lot of corn, a green pepper and tomato..it was not enjoyable for him having to pick apart his burrito. 
Another con is the cost for 8 tiny pieces of calamari... $10 for 8 pieces.....that's MORE than $1 a piece...however they were delicious and luckily I'm the only one who eats seafood! 
Also it wouldn't hurt to smile at the customers. 
4 stars is for the tremendous flavours. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Whenever I crave a burrito or burrito bowl I try to go to Burrito Boyz especially this location since I'm near the area often. I think I'm always here at good times because I've never waited for longer than 3 minutes in line to order.

This time around I got a small calamari & chicken burrito bowl with everything expect jalepenos and guacamole that you gotta pay extra for but is totally worth it. All of their ingredients are always fresh which is fabulous. I think I waited about 5 minutes for mine but my friend had to wait 10 minutes since he got a small calamari & steak burrito. Also a word of caution, the hot sauce they use is deadlyy. I got one line of hot sauce and I was feeling it!"}
{"text":"Popular burrito joint in the heart of the entertainment district. This new location is larger and better built to accommodate all of the party goers who frequent here late at night. They call out order numbers over their speaker system to keep things running efficiently when it gets busy. 

Portion sizes are generous here for the price. But make no mistake, this is a place for cheap food that skimps on the quality. I ordered a naked chicken burrito and the meat looked like a mushy pile that tasted really dry. Everything else on the plate was standard fare for a  burrito and wasn't anything special. 

If you're looking for a quick late night bite in the area, then Burrito Boyz is an option. But don't expect anything more than that Imo."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows great Mexican food would not eat here..it's sad that Canadians have no knowledge of anything other than mac and cheese. I was dragged by a coworker into this place for lunch, it made me sick..I felt like I was holding onto my baby's soggy wet diaper..disgusting beyond belief.."}
{"text":"Finally.. after all that I had heard about this franchise.  
Walked here from my work location with some co-workers on a Friday.  This place is great.  I think it was the happiest order taker ever... he was delighted to take my order.  
Burrito was HUGE.. and filled with fresh deliciousness.  My boss opted for a massive amount of hot sauce... something he regretted on our way home as he dove into Shoppers for some milk (and this dude puts hot sauce on everything).  So they can definitely spice up your life.  Location was efficient, friendly, clean.  No issues.. all good.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Standard Burrito Boyz quality (which is good) is brought down a bit by the cooking. Had burritos twoce here and both times the filling was not hot enough (i.e. the steak and shrimp). More time on the flat top or just keeping the filling at a hotter temp prior to filling would improve this place a lot.

Great location though. Supet close to Scotiabank theatre so very convenient to stop in beforw or after a movie."}
{"text":"Timing and location are great but I asked for no cilantro and they put it in. I'm not even sure I want to finish eating this now. I really wanted this as a treat for a terrible day at work but this what I get instead. Definitely not getting it from this location again."}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly people and very consistent food. They don't skimp on quality or quantity. One of the best Burrito Boyz locations.

If I could give this location 6 stars, I would. I placed an order on the app for this location but for some reason, it switched it to the one on Adelaide and I didn't notice. So I arrived here and they were confused saying that they hadn't received my order. That was when I realized where my order had gone and without even a thought, they offered to make me the same burrito, free of charge. Seriously good quality food, generous quantity and tremendous staff!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband. This place is hidden in a plaza. We found this place more of a take out place as there isn't much seating. However, the service is quick, prices are decent. Got a chicken burrito and you could choose your ingredients, plus or minus spicy sauce. It was around $8 and was very packed (including rice, beans, tomatoes, chicken, lettuce etc). I could hardly finish the whole burrito! My husband got the steak burrito (large) and he could hardly finish it as well. There was a table there, but very very limited seating, and no washrooms. For the price, it is a good deal and you definitely get good value for it. I'm glad they opened one in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on Sunday with family. The food was excellent. All the ingredients were fresh. It tasted delicious. The quantity was good. The staff was courteous. We will definitely go there again. 
By the way, their small sized burritos are a good enough size to fill up."}
{"text":"My favourite burrito place. Open late and so tasty! Always get the large beef :) their meat is freshly and their ingredient too! The staff is quick and friendly! And dinning in has plenty of room. Their combo comes with chips and salsa. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place great burritos and it's affordable highly recommend this restaurant.The service is quick and on the go great for students"}
{"text":"Food ***12

Great spot for burritos.  Halibut Burrito is delicious!

I can handle some heat but the hotsauce is deadly.   Be careful!"}
{"text":"This place sure doesn't NEED yet another review but I have to throw my two cents in. 
 I meet with friends here for lunch every couple weeks. They could definitely use more tables and chairs to serve their customers since there's usually a mad dash for the few seats there. 

My order : small halibut burrito ~ it's soooo good. I love that the burrito always is toasted well on the outside. They're pretty efficient with the orders and have tons of toppings that you can choose from. I usually get everything except no beans, refried beans, or rice. Even so, this meal makes me fall asleep in the afternoon at work o.o"}
