{"text":"Clean restaurant, tasty food, and friendly service - I'll definitely be coming back.

I had the seafood pho with rice noodles and it was delicious. Size small was big enough for me, but medium is only $1 more, so maybe go medium. 

Water came in a nice tall glass, and tasted fresh. I appreciate this kind of attention to detail. 

So glad to have this fantastic pho restaurant so close to home."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero star, I would. I'd like to start by saying I have eaten here number of times (once on my birthday) without a problem and frankly I enjoyed the food and service, but my experience tonight has made me question my prior dining experiences here. 

I came with a friend (who has eaten here before), sat, order and just as we began to eat I looked down at her place and saw TWO THICK BLACK HAIRS. And these were not short hairs either, they were at least 6 inches long, noticeable and mixed into the noodle dish. We both regret that we didn't take a photo of it, it was absolutely awful! Mind you my friend has long BROWN hair and I have BLUE hair so there is not way it was either of ours.

We brought it to the wait staffs attention and she immediately apologized and replaced the dish, but that's not it. We both are nearing the end of our dishes when my friend taps me on the shoulder and point to her plate (she basically finished the dish) which once again has TWO MORE HAIRS IN IT (we took a photo of this). This time they are small, but this is absolutely unacceptable. 

I call over a woman, who, when asked, tells me she is the manager. I point to the dish and tell her this is unacceptable. She beings to ARGUE with me, trying to explain the these hairs are actually fibers from a microfiber cloth that they use to wipe the plates down. She doesn't even apologize! She brings out a light blue microfiber cloth and starts to justify our findings, I stop her in her tracks and ask her why the employees don't wear hair nets (I see them bring the food to the window, they wear hats) and why she thinks that finding cloth fibers in food is any better. She says she will take my friends food off the bill and that's the best she can do. 

I look her straight in the face and tell her there is no way in hell I'm paying for anything on the table, if she had just apologized and taken accountability for what we found I would have paid for my portion of the food. But after she tried to justify it and said they wiped down ALL the plates with said towel that left hair on my friends plate, how the hell do I know I didn't spend my night eating hair.... 

Next time, don't argue with your customers, APOLOGIZE when you are wrong and don't make us pay for food that is contaminated by your staff. Shame on you! I will never come back and I will be sure to tell every person I meet to AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly clean for a Vietnamese restaurant.  I guess it's still pretty new, give it another month or so and it might become like the others lol.

Spring rolls, medium pho, bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup), che ba mau (3 bean drink) and avocado shake was what we ordered. 

Soup for both noodles was pretty good, no complaints.  Although it can use more beef lol.  Spring rolls was just average, not the best and not the worst.  Both drinks were average, actually a bit on the sweet side. 

Pricing... this is where the difference is and why it got only 3 stars.  Everything was about 10-15% more than your average Vietnamese restaurant.  A medium pho was $7, the spicy beef soup was $8 (M), spring rolls $4 (good price), both drinks $4.50 each. Looking at other items on the menu, things were a bit more pricey than other places. 

I keep comparing prices to places in the Jane & Finch area.  I don't think it is fair, there are more competitors in that area and why prices are a bit lower than anywhere else. 

Will I come back... probably not.  If I was in that area and wanted Vietnamese food, I would just drive another 10 mins to better places."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one weekend and even though this restaurant is pretty big, it was packed. Luckily they had one table for two left in the corner. It's rare to see a Viet restaurant with consistently high ratings so we were definitely curious to see what the hype is about. 

The food was good but not memorable. We ordered: 
- Fresh shrimp rolls: Since the fresh rolls are raved and loved by everyone, we ordered the shrimp rolls to try. These were good but not outstanding. 
- Bun bo hue: This was delicious! I am always on the look out for bun bo hue at restaurants and this one was great. The flavour was on point and they were generous with the toppings. This also came with its own plate of bean sprouts and cabbage. 
- Beef pho: Couldn't remember which one we ordered and while this was good, it wasn't significantly better than other pho I've had. 

Although the food didn't exceed expectations, we still had a decent meal. The prices are higher than your average Viet restaurant and I'm not entirely sure that it's worth it. I might come back, only if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Our first time here. We love Pho and have frequented quite a few establishments in york region. This restaurant's Pho is absolutely delicious and has now become our favourite! Service is fast, place is clean with ample space. Prices are reasonable. $8.50 for a medium Pho which filled us to the brim. We will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place, one of the freshet and purest soups I have had. I love their rare beef noodle soup and look forward to it every time!"}
{"text":"Finally I found a PHO place that has some VEGETARIAN broth PHO ... I haven't had pho in over 10 years or maybe never actually, :S lol ..But whenever I see PHO i always think, 'that looks delicious, but its meat-based soup, I can't have it :'( ....... now I found this place, I'm So happy that I finally can have some Pho'kin Noodles , and it' s pretty good/tasty..(even my non-vegetarian dad tried their veg-pho and agreed)

 I'm a regular customer now ... BONUS--- they have Bubble Tea !

place is nice and clean

*** I very much appreciate how they have a Vegetarian MENU , whereas aLOT of other places , especially pho-asian places Do not...


I ordered their tofu spring rolls, and the sauce is s'good...

can't wait to try more stuff from here.."}
{"text":"This probably my favourite local pho restaurant. You won't be disappointed with the broth in the well done beef pho. Delicious!! Service is prompt and the place is clean!"}
{"text":"I love this place!
I've been going with my family for almost 2 years, and the food is consistently delicious!!
I usually get the pho, which I'm now addicted to. It's some of the best pho I've had, anywhere in the city, or ever!
The food comes out super fast, every time, even when they're incredibly busy. 

I even once left my wallet, and the counter staff called my cell phone to return it immediately. 

I've definitely been guilty of getting it 3-5 times a week, when I'm in town. 

Seriously, best pho ever. Even the *vegetarian* pho is awesome!"}
{"text":"We moved to the area from downtown, so a good spot for pho/Vietnamese food we were looking for. Place is usually busy, yet spacious. Love it here! The Pho is really good, the broth is not too oily, and great portion sizes. The rice dishes are delicious with good portions. Only compliant on my part is sometimes the meats are fatty, which i personally don't like. Same goes with the pork and chicken in the rice dishes. 
The spring rolls are bomb!
Nonetheless id definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is my \"local\" spot. I have been coming here since it opened. The quality, portions, price, flavours and decor have stayed great since the beginning. There is a reason I keep coming back and only very rarely, try another Pho shop. When it comes to Pho, I am a purist and normal opt for the rare beef variety. Recently, however, I have switched over to their Rare Beef + Well Done beef variety (which is actually their flank brisket). Delicious!!! I have also tried their Vermicelli bowls, spring rolls, Bun Bo Hue, Satay Beef Soup, and Northern Vietnam Style Rare Beef soups, which have a few different herbs worked into the broth if I remember correctly (it's been a while since I had the last one). The spring rolls are not the greatest here, IMHO -  I prefer the crispier varieties that have a few chopped peanuts sprinkled over top. Nor is the Beef Satay soup - Xe Lua has a tastier, spicier Satay broth. Last night I had the fried shrimp snack and they were delicious, served with a Sweet Thai Chili Sauce (probably poured out of a bottle, but tasty nonetheless.) If you are in the Thornhill, Vaughan, Richmondhill, Bathurst and Steeles area, this is a great spot for cheap, delicious, fast Vietnamese food. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place and have brought a number of people here that keep coming back themselves."}
{"text":"Really great bang for your buck. I went here for take out on a Saturday afternoon. The place was packed but they seated us at a table specifically for takeout customers so we can look through the menu. I got a chicken pho and an avocado milkshake and it came out to $11.87 including tax, that's a really great price for a meal around this area especially because I got a milkshake with it. The food came out in under 5 minutes and when I got it home it was huge!!! They have 4 sizes for their soups: small, medium, large and extra large. I got a medium and I couldn't even finish it. The only thing is that for takeout they give you all the components and you have to put it in your own bowl. Will definitely be back again since they have a huge menu and I can't wait to try something else!"}
{"text":"Best pho. Love it here so much. So delicious and affordable. Best and friendly staff. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I am going to start this review by saying that I LOVE pho. I find it to be one of the ultimate comfort foods and I never tire of having a huge bowl of hot beef noodle soup. In no way do I say this to suggest that I am some sort of expert when it comes to pho, but it's more to say that you aren't likely to see a negative review from me when it comes to this soul satisfying dish. All this is to say, that while some pho is better than others, I haven't really come across a bowl of pho that I didn't like. 

Pho Viet Xpress is my go to pho restaurant and I have had numerous meals here. That being said, I will almost always order the same meal (creature of habit I suppose or maybe I'm just someone who knows what he wants).  My typical meal consists of the deep fried spring rolls (menu item 101), the grilled beef fresh rolls (menu item 103B), and the XPRESS special beef rice noodle soup (menu item 305). 

To start, the spring rolls are nice and crispy, but they also have a chewy quality to them that I only seem to find with Vietnamese spring rolls. They come out nice and hot and are always a delight to eat. 

Even better in my opinion however are the fresh rolls. They are quite large and true to their name, they are always fresh. For the grilled beef rolls, there is a good amount of beef along with vermicelli noodles and some green veggies - yum!

As for the pho, it never disappoints. It is always abundant, hot, savory, and delicious. The special rice noodle soup comes with beef, tendon, tripe, and a beef ball. The soup broth is clear without much in the way of any fat or oil.  To me, it is seasoned just right as I find some places can emphasize certain flavours like star anise. The beef also is typically quite lean.  You get the usual accompaniments like bean sprouts, basil, lime etc. On the days my belt is feeling a little snug, I will opt to get a medium sized bowl which is quite filling, but on other days when I am feeling good and can't help myself, I will get a large bowl which will absolutely stuff you!

The restaurant itself is a decent size with plenty of seating but despite that it gets quite busy during dinner and there can often be a small wait to get a table.  The service is always friendly and efficient and I don't think I am being biased by the fact that they are now all quite familiar to me given how frequently I eat here.  The place is also clean and rather comfortable and I have spent a lot of time chatting with friends over many bowls of pho here - nothing like sharing a a meal of the ultimate comfort food with good friends. 

Even if you are not as big a fan of pho as I am, I think most would agree that the pho here is quite excellent. I certainly have no hesitation in highly recommending it."}
{"text":"Love this bun! Always so satisfying! I chose the grilled pork and the choice of one side. For me it's always the shrimp on sugar cane. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Amount of soup and meat is very low, I'd say lowest around; taste of soup is also not the best,
If someone likes very nice soup try at Keele & Wilson just near beer store"}
{"text":"Because where this Pho restaurant is situated, it is relatively cleaner than its other pho siblings.

You come here because you want to see how in fleek the staff's eyebrows are. Lol jk we're here for Vietnamese food, come on give me a laugh.

So I would ONLY recommend Pho here, maybe a 4/5~The soup is great, and that's all that really matters, oh and they use noodles that are right for my taste. Sometimes you go to chinese owned Pho places and you get these noodles that aren't just quite right. But if that's what your used to then that's fine too, everyone has different taste, but this review isn't about you.

The rice dishes (Com tam) 2/5~ the rice they use is just normal rice. For me this is a deal breaker. Like if you look good on the outside and have a horrible personality, it's just hard to swallow... figuratively.

Vermicelli dishes 3/5~ I mean you can't really screw up here. Vermicelli and fish sauce then some meat. Of course you need to get Nem nuong (Viet pork sausage) with with or else I would question why you are getting this at all. They have a different take on this. It's not your usual red sausage cut up. But they have cute balls put on skewer, the taste is also different and unique. Not bad, but its just not what im used to.

So there you have it, hope you enjoy your meal here! I wonder if you got to the end of this review :p"}
{"text":"Very popular place, everytime I come here there's usually a lineup so come early. Small groups are faster and preferred here. Overall, a great place for authentic and tasty Viet food experience.

Food: 
Ordered the special house express beef rice noodle. I ordered the small and it was a good portion. It came with bean sprouts, Thai basil and lime. It came with beef, beef ball, tendon, etc. The texture of noodles was good and the broth was flavourful and not salty. 

Atmosphere:
Very busy place with fast service. Casual seating so not a date place, more like a family style restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried this spot for the first time a couple months back and I keep going back because its that good! My favs are the deep fried spring rolls, rare beef pho and grilled chicken,beef with rice! So flavorful, so good!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here and I am pretty discerning with my meals. This place has NEVER disappointed. Food is always fresh, quick to arrive, and DELICIOUS. CONSISTENTLY!!! Always full and friendly staff even when they are under pressure. Also, incredibly reasonably prices for the quality and service."}
{"text":"First time going here and won't be the last!

The restaurant is one of the cleanest Vietnamese restaurants I've been too. Service was fast and friendly. But most importantly, the food was EXCELLENT. 

Can't wait to return. This is my new favourite spot."}
{"text":"Can't be beat for the price, food is excellent, portions are large. Only draw back is often there is a line up to get in, but I assure you it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is spotless. I tried the pad Thai as the tips in Yelp rated it so good. When I tried it, found it too saucy and it didn't taste like pad Thai. There isn't any sweet and sour taste to it.
I also tried the steamed rice noodle with pork. That was OK. I wish I have had order a bowl of noodle to try."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my go-to place for pho. They serve delicious pho as well as other Vietnamese dishes. The servers are responsive and prompt. I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Pho Viet Xpress is definitely one of the busier Pho spots in Thornhill, possibly the busiest one, after dining here it made sense why that was. Service is fast, servers are very attentive and the food is good. I ordered the Pho Special, portions are generous, broth is clean, and there was a moderate amount of meat in the soup.Their rice dishes are good as well, meat isn't dry, generous amount of meat and lots of options / different combinations for their rice dishes. Another bonus is they have multiple sauces on each table, so that you can alter the meal as you please.  The mango milkshake had a very thick consistency, sweet but not overly sweet, very good pairing after a nice bowl of pho."}
{"text":"Spring Roll with Shrimps (score: 4.8/5)
I have had this kind of spring roll many times. What makes this spring roll outstanding at this restaurant is the mint inside and not to mention the hoisin sauce with carrot slices and peanuts. They all work together in harmony to make this dish perfect.

Seafood with Glass Noodle (soup on the side) (score: 5/5)
Haven't had glass noodle for a long time. This item was recommended by a Vietnamese friend and showed me how to eat it. Instead of pouring the bowl of soup into the noodle, scoop a few spoonfuls of soup into the noodle according to my liking of saltiness. Crack the fried shrimp on the cracker into pieces and then mix the soup and the noodle as well as the seafood together to eat. Soooo delicious!! 

The only negative comment that I would say is the spring roll has taken a long time to arrive with several chase."}
{"text":"Came here tonight during our night out in Vaughan for dinner! My sister and dad ordered pho, my mom ordered a bun with pork blood, sausage, pork, and beef, and I got the bun cha ca (my first time).

I had ordered a different dish initially (the 210), but they were sold out and so I had to resort to the 211. The broth was shallow in flavour, and frankly, quite tasteless. Like the other three bowls, mine came with a generous portion of garnishes and meat. I had six pieces of fish paste, four pieces of sausage, and two prawns. There was also a whole boatload of noodles! Although the fish cake tasted good, the overall dish failed to impress.

Overall, an okay place, but I've had better."}
{"text":"I came to this place and ordered the rice pancake with pork in it, pleasantly surprised by the freshness of the pancake how moist and warm the combination of the pancake was. Little mushrooms added some crunch there also. Cherry on top the fish sauce well balance but of course I added some chilly sauce in it. The pho was great. I asked the waitress if they have fresh noodles they do but not sure if its the best place for fresh noodle, the texture that I was looking for wasn't there. It was more like those small noodles replaced by bigger noodles. But the soup itself was outstanding. I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here to check it out, ordered spring rolls small size, the express pho, and satay pho,. The broth for the express pho was really salty, much saltier then any other place that we've been to, Not sure if it was just a saltier batch. The noodle texture was pretty good, not soggy nor all bunched together in the broth.  The spring rolls are a little dry,  the filling of the spring rolls seems little too well minced and doesnt show too much flavor.  the satay pho was on the other hand a good balance of flavor and spice, price level in general seem a little higher then other pho places"}
{"text":"Pho Viet Xpress is in a little strip plaza where Starbucks is.  Shouldn't be too hard to find.  Pho here is pretty good.  Soup broth is very tasty and noodles were cooked to perfect tenderness.  I hate when other places gives me super soft over-cooked noodles.  Beef is okay not the best I had but overall will come back in the future and try other stuff here.  Portion for the pho is pretty good size as well"}
{"text":"My favorite pho place in the area.  Their spring rolls are a must have as well as the wontons in the appetizers."}
{"text":"The soup is out of this world! Great service but it does get busy so come early. I was never a fan of just eating soup but got into it quicklyt. I eat it at least once a month if not two. 
Spicy beef pho is the way to go, the vermicelli is delish as well! Chicken and shrimp spring roll is tastey too. 

They also pack the soup to go well, just boil the soup at home and drop it in a bowl with all the noddles and meat."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weekday

Pros 
Price to portion ratio was good
Pad Thai tasted great
Service was quick

Cons
Pho soup was nothing special."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm not a big Asian food lover but they have many things on their menu to choose from. We love the soups and noodle dishes. We have eaten there many times and taken food to go. Friendly staff, quick service and delicious food! Definitely worth visiting.. yes, this place can be busy as well! So plan your visit.."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice... spacious and clean.
The staff all really nice and friendly.
The pho here is great. Good broth, and very generous with the beef."}
{"text":"A great choice for Pho in the Thornhill area, with great service and amazing price. The only drawback is that the place tends to get really busy and you might have to wait some time to be seated and also some more time to be served. Also the quality of the food is really good, but the taste lacks a bit of depth compared to other's pho's I have had downtown Toronto"}
{"text":"The place its self is very clean, new, two tv screens and open late (11- midnight) every day, which is perfect for some late night pho, or wake and pho!
I also liked that they had a huge selection of dishes and different types of pho! ( including bbh)  even had one that my brother got called north veit pho which was a pho tei but with ginger and a different type of beef on it and it was good, now why  I don't think it's a perfect pho place was the noodle was just a little off almost like plastic and the broth wasn't quite perfect could use a little more flavour butttt it wasn't over done in MSG which I hate! It was very light on MSG which is just perfect for me who can't stand pho with too much MSG! My other problem was the slow service at first, at 10pm and only two other tables, I don't think cleaning the place should take over serving tea to your guests who have walked it, it wasn't till after I ordered my food and about 10-15min after I walked in that I was given tea! 
I think this place will do just fine an Im sure they will figure out the noodles!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night and the food was great! I had the rare beef rice noodle soup and it was to die for. It was also both lactose and gluten free, which gives this place a huge star in my eyes.  The soup was perfect and so delicious.

My friend ordered another rice noodle soup and he really enjoyed his dish as well. We also ordered the shrimp skewer appetizers and the rice paper veggie rolls. Everything was fantastic and the prices were really great!  I can't wait to go back for more rice noodle soup.  I'll definitely be bringing my family here so they can enjoy this hidden gem."}
{"text":"The best pho ever ..... Customer service was great... I always get pho special and they spring rolls"}
{"text":"I've tried plenty of pho in Vaughan, and have to say this place is my favourite!  The restaurant itself is very clean, tidy, and modern-looking.  The service is fast, the food is excellent, and their prices are very reasonable.  I've tried their chicken and shrimp pad thai, their chicken cold rolls, and their chicken pho.

Pho Viet Xpress does not skimp on portions.. the medium bowl of pho is always extremely filling, usually with some leftovers.  The large order of cold rolls is sufficient as a meal in itself.. They are fresh, made to order, and very large.  I found their peanut dipping sauce to be a little on the watery side, compared to other places.

Early dinner or late night munchies, this place satisfies!"}
{"text":"This is one of the authentic Vietnamese restaurant. This place is more like a fast food version of viet food. They have good soup base for the rare beef noodle that I ordered. The beef is pretty good but for people's who like it more on the rare side could let the server put the beef on a side plate. Or if you would like more of the rare beef could order another plate on side for only $3 and is good amount of beef. The spring roll is good too and we also order the dry egg noodles seafood. 

Recommended if in the area to give it a try will not disappoint you guys 

Don't expect much of a services for the server cause they get really busy all the time."}
{"text":"Pho-nomenal! Came here for a Viet feast. Got the Northern Viet pho, fresh rolls and banh cuon. The rolls were super fresh and the vegetables added the much needed crispyness to the vermecelli and shrimp filling. The banh cuon (pork rice rolls) came with vegetablesand viet pate on the side. It had an interesting taste. My favorite is the pho. The Northern Viet soup base was seasoned different from the typical pho bowl. The soup was not too greasy and the meat tasted fresh. Overall, it was an un-phogettable experience!"}
{"text":"The place is always busy. Staffs are friendly and the restaurant is fairly clean. I've had pho most of the time during my visit. What I like about their pho is their noodle; thin rice noodle. The broth is also clean tasting (not too herbally if you know what i mean), not too oily and very soothing. Fair meat portion for a small bowl of pho. They only accept cash and debit card."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago for lunch as I wanted to try some new place for pho. I was pleasantly surprised, as far as taste went, it was about as good as most uptown pho restaurants. The broth was hot and flavourful while noodles had a good consistency as well. 

I went for the house special pho while my girlfriend had just the rare beef pho. I was satisfied with the portions, we each had a medium pho, more than enough for her, just enough for me. We also ordered crispy spring rolls, they were crispy and hot when they came out, just as they should be. 

For about $20 tax and tip give or take a dollar, it was a pretty good value if you ask me. I would go here again. Just because it's cleaner than most pho restaurants uptown. Took off one star because the service was passable, not phenomenal or anything, nor was it bad, it was just that. Service. 

If you're in the area or live uptown, check it out."}
{"text":"Amazing food, super clean bright and organized. Love the servers. Guide me on the menu and suggested ppl favoured. Recommend 100% coming back soon.  The to waitress are super cute."}
{"text":"I live in the area and went for the first time today. The restaurant has nice decor and ambiance, clean and spacious. 

They had no more rice rolls today so that was disappointing.. main reason I came was for that.

Pho is decent, nice broth. Very small portion of noodles though.. why skimp on that? Noodles are so cheap! They lose another star due to the lack of meat.. I don't think there was even one slice of beef.. just a few shreds. Very disappointing.

The profit margins are huge for beef pho, is it necessary to skimp so much on noodles and beef?
Don't think I'll be a return customer."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Saturday night even though it seemingly looks to be in the middle of no where.

I found this place randomly and I'm glad I did.  The Pho House special was just what the doctor ordered.

Maybe I've been too accustomed to over salted stock, I found this a tad under seasoned, but I think it's probably at the \"right\" level where you're not craving a glass of water after consuming some of the soup.

So if you're in the area and need some Pho, this seems like a hot spot."}
{"text":"Great pho, I get the small and the Bowl is very filling. Great value and consistently good."}
{"text":"This is a solidly decent pho spot. I've eaten at some of the top pho spots in Toronto, so I'm a bit picky. 

We each ordered the pho and a plate of fresh shrimp rolls to share. The shrimp rolls were good, and we liked the accompanying peanut sauce. You can tell a lot about a pho place by their peanut sauce. I believe their's was homemade, which is a great sign.

Service was quick and good. But I care more about food than service.

The pho was good but not great, and it wasn't hot enough. Nothing to write home about, but a solid place if you need your fix."}
{"text":"This gets my vote for the best pho in my area. Their broth is richer than most other pho places I've tried. Portions are large and prices are good. I'm a regular here for these reasons. 

I stick with their 305 after trying their other items. This beef noodle soup is unbeatable.

Very clean for a viet restaurant. Staff are efficient."}
{"text":"Pho tastes delicious. Broth is tasty. I always get the house special and it's great. Portions can be a little bigger and price can be more reasonable, however.

The plates are also great - the chicken/pork chop are tender. The sauce adds a lot of flavour to it (sweet). They add a lot of rice!!! I wish the meat portions were equal to how much rice they provide...that would be so awesome and filling!

Also love their pad thai. Great flavour and spice. 

Take out is great. Very quick and they provide utensils. 

Service is okay like every other asian restaurant. They are more focused on ensuring that your orders come in a timely manner....they don't  really bother you and ask you how you're doing...which I really don't mind.

Price is reasonable, food is tasty and service is ok. I always go here for Pho. Great place."}
{"text":"This place truly gives you the authentic Pho...have been coming here for the past three years and never disappointed...meat portions are really generous and the restaurant is spotless"}
{"text":"I went to this place on a busy Friday night but didn't wait too long to be seated. The food came out surprisingly fast. Quality of the food is not bad, very fulfilling, and tasty."}
{"text":"Tried pho and fresh shrimp roll and they were fantastic! The broth tasted flavourful and hot! Owned by Vietnamese owner so I am guessing it's more authentic as well. Prices are reasonable with good portion. Definitely my favourite pho restaurant uptown."}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese pho! You can tell because customers were either Vietnamese or extra cultured, myself included *smugface.

We came here for pho. I wasn't sure which one to pick. The waitress recommended Mr. 305 which contained a mix of different types of pho meats. Soup was rich. Meat was delicious. Rice noodles were tasty. Vietnamese portions. Puts 'Murican portions to shame. Stick to a small bowl, trust me.

Clean place. Wonderful waitresses. Xpress service. Shiny name tags! Reasonable prices. Overall great pho here and you should surely check it out."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.. Service was fast. Food was great they actually had great vegetarian options!! And the portions are humongous!"}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese food. Menu is extensive. We got mainly appetizers on this occasion so we'll be back to try some noodle and main dishes. Restaurant is spacious and clean. Can be quite crowded during the weekend."}
{"text":"Great pho broth has great taste and not too heavy on the noodles.  My gf had the vermicelli she really enjoyed it but thought the fish sauce was kind of light..  Very clean and friendly service, if it were closer to where I lived it'd be my new pho takeout place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and local! 
Everything is well prepared.. Pho, lemongrass beef vermicelli dish, grilled chicken. chicken wings and especially the vietnamese coffee ... outstanding.. Try the satay sauce , nice addition to kick up the pho.."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre. The pho is pretty good, I got the rare beef and beef tripe but the beef tripe to rare beef ratio was like 1:4."}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese food for very cheap price would recommend to anyone looking for good quality pho"}
{"text":"I come here all the time because it's convenient, relatively cheap for its portions, and always quick service. Definitely try one of their drinks - smoothie or bubble tea. Always fresh fruit and you can customize it to your liking! It's cash or debit only though."}
{"text":"The pho was delicious. As for the other food and service, it was rather bad. I came in with a group of 4. They provided us with only two waters. When I asked for more, they shrugged and gave us only one more leaving someone still without water. The pho is really good. Not overwelm ing at all. But the shrimp on sugar cane was way to oily and had almost no flavour. In addition, the spring rolls were bland and way to oily. Overall, not the best restaurant out there for pho."}
{"text":"My buddy and I were feeling like pho for dinner and that meant that we drove across town for this little joint because of the reviews here. 
We were not disappointed whatsoever, This This is a great place for pho and other Vietnamese cuisine, full of Asian people so you know it's authentic. 
Just 1 advice, BE CAREFULL with the little chopped hot peppers, they are crazy spicy. 
I made the mistake of putting too much in my pho and cried throughout the dinner."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with 3 other adults and a baby.  Couldn't believe there was a line-up out the door.  Got a table in 15 minutes.  My 1st time here was 3 years ago and it wasn't that good so I never bothered returning...but after seeing the line the other day, I had high expectations and hoped it would be my new Viet spot since it's pretty close to where I live.  But no, I was disappointed,  Bun Bo Hue lacked flavour and hearty-ness...broth was watery.  Bun Thit Nuong had too much lettuce and not enough vermicilli and meat.  The meat was also a bit too soft and wasn't grilled for long enough.  Bun Rieu also lacked flavour and broth was watery.  The only decent item we had was the Banh Cuon.  I would return only for that."}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious. Very spacious restaurant as well. Staff were accommodating. Tables and chairs could have been cleaner. Will most likely come back if I'm craving some Vietnamese."}
{"text":"I always order a meat spring roll with noodles. It comes with two large spring rolls vermicelli noodles complete with lettuce, bean sprouts, mints and fish sauce for $9 + tax. There are options to get grilled pork/chicken, meatballs or shrimp on sugar cane by substituting a spring roll for the same price.
I feel that the amount of meat is barely enough to finish the noodles. Kind of feels disappointing when you cant enjoy the meat by itself without worrying about how much noodles to finish off.
I like the spring rolls they make here. It has a savoury nutty flavour that tastes like home cooking. Fried just right however when its in the bowl, they don't stay crispy.
Service was prompt when ordering and delivering food."}
{"text":"Amazing quality pho soup ! Broth was beautiful and flavourful portions are huge!!!!!!! I've been touring all over for the best pho and so far this is the best restaurant ! 

You gotta eat here"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place for Vietnamnese place for Pho, service was good but kind of slow will go back and try the vermicelli and rice next then and beef pho but looks like  a good place."}
{"text":"LOVE it!  moved into the area hoping to find a good vietnamese restaurant.  It's been found.  Great quality and quantiry for very reasonable price !!!! We will be visiting often."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto! The place is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is great. The price is not bad either. Their pho is to die for. The broth is flavourful, not too greasy and the ingredients are always fresh. I would definitely come back here again!!!"}
{"text":"Good Pho in a great location, tried many times, sometimes the Pho is good, sometimes it is not; however, compare to the Pho Saigon St just open close to you, you guys are way better. Your servers still speak Vietnamese and their owners don't even speak a single Vietnamese word."}
{"text":"This place just opened up recently and I went there this afternoon for takeout. I ordered the Freshrolls and porkrine rolls and they were very good.   The wait staff were super friendly. I will have to come back for a sit in soon.

There are a few other Pho restaurants in the area ... but this place is way better.  Even for pickup ... the servers provide tea while I waited.  Thank you ... great service."}
{"text":"Came back recently and had the bun bo hue.

A bit of a letdown, as there was too much spicy chili oil in the soup.  Usually, a good bun bo hue shouldn't be overly powerful that it masks the subtle flavors like lemongrass, shrimp paste in the soup.    I've a feeling the soup came from pho soup base, sprinkled with bun bo hue soup powder (yes, you can get the soup base in powder form) and then the chili oil was added to mask the pho taste?  

However, gf had pho as she cannot for the life of her eat anything remotely spicy - you could smell the pho coming from a mile away.  

I had a stomach ache from the super spicy bowl of bun bo hue for almost 2 days.  

Note to self: do not order it again next time.

And oh, found out that this place opened last November of 2013.  

It's now my 2nd go to place for good pho!

1 star rating for this review cuz of the killer stomach aching bun bo hue!"}
{"text":"Quality Convenient Pho

Weekday lunch
No wait

Pho Viet Xpress has become my local favourite now that Xelua Vietnamese Restaurant has gotten so terrible (used to be my favourite spot, but in the past few years, my most recent trips have been embarrassingly bad - my friends politely told me it was some of the worst they've had). I don't know what they did to the broth and noodles.

Located in a low key strip mall, the narrow facade (by Toronto standards) gives a false sense of the actual size of the restaurant as there is usually ample seating. The space is clean and has a bit more of a modern feel which is nice.

The pho broth and noodles are good. Portions are very generous (maybe a bit to much so) so I generally order a size down and try not to order with my eyes instead of my stomach. I'm an ambitious eater and find myself satisfied with a medium order and a summer roll. Their grilled meat on vermicelli dishes are a good choice. Presentation is a bit lacking as can be seen from the \"artful craftsmanship\" on the summer rolls, but the food is otherwise good.

Clientele is the local populace mostly composed of families. No one is really driving out of their way to eat here."}
{"text":"My favourite pho restaurant has opened a second location near Weston & Hwy 7! 

So clean and the menu is just like the first location.

I always get the

*Pho ?ac biet - classic famous vietnamese soup with errthang

*Pho Sate - same classic soup but SPICY

*BÁNH  CUON - rice noodle rolls with ground pork meat, dipped in fish sauce  : my absolute  fav appetizer!

My friends love the rice dishes and pad thai.

This restaurant is so clean and it doesnt have the tacky vietnamese decor you see that other restaurants. I can eat in peace."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Pho stores to go to. It is spacious and clean with modern decor, not tacky and cheap at all like other places. 

The Pho is amazing, always hot. I recommend getting the deep fried shrimp rolls and \"banh cuon\" which is pork meat wrapped in semi-transparent dough and steamed. 

Service was great, everyone is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this place for quite some time now. Every week I drive by it right after volleyball and I have been itching to stop by for the past half a year. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and I just had to dive in.

The soup is HOT, so hot it hurts immensely so beware. It felt like drinking boiling oil. LOL It's not a complain but rather a compliment. I would rather have second-degree-burns inducing soup than something that is lukewarm. However, perhaps this is also one of the things that might have inadvertently ruined the pho...just a little bit. The heat from the soup further cooked the al-dente noodles to overdone. Not a mood killer but still, it need not be so damn hot! Luckily the broth is quite tasty and full flavour.

The beef in the soup is negligible. Nothing worthy of mention here other than that it's just your standard plain tasting, super thinly sliced cuts of beef. It was so thin it actually clumped up in the soup and of course it's fully cooked once immersed in the 200 degree soup.

The vermicelli was also not worthy of mention. The grilled meats are okay in terms of flavour but a little too dry for my liking. There is inherently not enough meat-to-noodle ratio but you do get way too much noodles for your money. In fact that's true for the pho as well; giant portions for the price.

Go if you must but there are better ones out there."}
{"text":"Ive been there twice and i will never go again after the second experience. First off, service is horrible. The first time i went, i ordered the 612 vegetarian pho soup with veggies. Halfway through eating the meal, i found a dead fly just swimming in the middle of the soup, and then 2 minutes later i found ANOTHER FLY. It made me sick and i immediately stopped eating, paid and left. 

I decided to give it a try a second time about a month later and ordered the same vegetarian noodle soup and this time i had found a little chuck of meat that was half pink/half brown and you could see the shred texture of the beef. That was it. Being a vegetarian, i thought this was unacceptable. The food is not clean (regardless whether you get meat or veggie or seafood) and it can make people sick. Stay away people, please."}
{"text":"Best pho place I had tried till now. I tried couple of places for pho and this one get the best one. I really like everything about it. They have have many great phos amazing place. I have already came here multiple times after and love it . I will recommend anyone who love pho to come here and try it."}
{"text":"This place has never failed me. Great portion sizes, cheap prices and consistent quality. The service is great despite them always being busy and the staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Vietnamese restaurant. They recently upped their prices and for their pho, changed the sizes to be smaller - the previous medium is now their large ($10) and their previous large is now their XL ($12). They're always busy, and I don't mind restaurants increasing their prices, but making their portions smaller is a bit cheap, I think."}
{"text":"Amazing pho for mad cheap. Service is quick and everything i've ordered has been super good. Pho ga is especially insane. They always have the news on which is rly depressing but north york' pho game is definitely poppin"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food and fast service. The servers all wear electronic name tags which display their names which I thought was pretty good. It was packed when I came which is a good sign.

Ordered the grilled beef with rice and it came with a side of pickled salad. Not pickled carrots and dicon like other places. Pickled salad. I thought that was a very nice touch. Good grilled beef. 

Service was fast. Food came out in a reasonable time. Parking lot was full so had to park in the back. There is a bakery next door that sells bagels and an apple pie to die for! YUMMY. Overall, good and solid viet joint on bathurst street. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Good food and spotless place, menu offers many variations for each item. Service is fast although the waitresses don't say much.  The place is always busy and my one compliant if any is servers are rushing around.   I like vermicelli with shredded pork and spring roll.  

Great place for quick bit not for quiet dinner"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Pho when in Woodbridge.  A big thumbs up!!!!  Portions are a little smaller than some Vietnamese restaurants I have been to, but not a big deal.  It is very clean and cozy as well!"}
{"text":"We came here as our friend suggested authentic Vietnamese food.  The restaurant looks very clean when we first walked in.  We ordered a few dishes and overall experience is good.  The price is very reasonable compare to other Vietnamese pho restaurant.  There's nothing wrong with the restaurant, however, I didn't find anything that will spark/urge me in coming again."}
{"text":"Service is quick and the food is good. The thing I like best about this place is that they are open til the very last minute of their closing time. A lot of places close 15 minutes or so before closing time especially for take out."}
{"text":"Horrible rice noodles! It is like from the instant noodles and some veggies. They put some mushrooms uncooked and uncleaned! There was a hair inside the soup and I told the lady that I will pay for my dish. Definitely not a place that I will revisit"}
{"text":"The service was fine, the food was fine, the experience at the restaurant was neutral. I don't have any complains but nothing necessarily to rave about either. I had the egg noodles with pork and seafood  and soup on the side. This was a good idea because sometimes there is too much broth and this allowed me to add the amount that I wanted. 

If you are in the area, and feeling Pho do try this place. The restaurant was busy during the Friday lunch time we went."}
{"text":"A great little Pho place around the North York area.

Pros:
Large place with lots of seats
Noodle portions are great

Cons:
Prices are a bit higher

From some strange reason, there aren't too many Pho places around the Yonge and Finch/Steeles area.  Angus Pho is one of my favs but seating is limited and there's only street parking.  If I'm looking for a place nearby to sit down with some parking, Pho Viet Xpress is my go to now.

This place is much bigger than it appears from the outside.  There are a lot of seats and we've never had to wait for a table, even on a busy night. They have a lot to choose from here.  Many varieties for Pho, spicy Pho, vermicelli, rice and the usual suspects can be found. 

The Pho here is pretty decent.  I won't say it's the best, but it is a very good bowl of Pho.  They use a thin noodle here which I really like.  Talking about the noodles, they give you a pretty good portion of that per bowl.  I wish they would give you more meat, but that's my wish to every Pho place I go so I'm nitpicking there.  

The prices are a little on the high side.  The largest bowl will set you back more than $10.  I never thought I would be paying more than $10 for Pho but I am. I didn't take off too many points for this because this seems to be what's happening for Pho in North York and areas close by.  I'm seeing a lot of $10 prices appearing more and more and in North York.  They are still under $10 in Scarborough, Richmond Hill and Markham though.

All in all, still a great place to get your Pho fix.  There are cheaper options located further away if you're in North York.  This place is still a pretty good bet."}
{"text":"Parking - Free: Lot is medium size, I usually never have trouble finding parking whenever I dine here.

Queue: Despite this place being very busy, I've never had to wait to be seated every time I've dined here. So just walk in and there should be seats available.

Environment: Very clean compared to other Pho restaurants I've been too, the floors are clean, the bathrooms are well maintained. Utensils that you order with your dish come wrapped in a napkin as opposed to having to pick out your utensils from a container like some other Pho joints.

Staff: Friendly, attentive and prompt.

Food: The Pho was mediocre, but the Pad Thai was very good! The vegetarian spring rolls were alright. The fried rice dish was good. And their avocado shakes are one of the best I've had. It's worth it to come back just for the pad thai and avocado itself."}
{"text":"Place is not bad!!! Definitely better then Train!! I will add to this review and say the service is much better then train! Waitresses were very attentive and quick!

Would probably come here going forward instead of Train! This place is more authentic / waitresses and menu included.

Ordered the rare beef pho small with extra rare beef of the side and a small order of spring rolls.  Total came to less then $17.00 so the pho was about $1 more expensive and the meat also a $1 more expensive.

But the proton of extra meat was more then double of Train. The pho soup was about the same.. Noodles were good.. The bean sprout plate had a extra piece of green veggie which other authentic viet pho places give and I like so bonus points.

The chicken/shrimp spring roll were also more expensive compared to train but also tasted better!!

Given the competition in the immediate area, 4 stars - recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here for a late soup with my sister. 
We ordered the mango salad and the fresh rolls to start. Both delicious and fresh which is very important. We both ordered pho after, my sister a veggie and myself a seafood (trying something different). The noodles and broth were both delicious, my only complaint is the lack of seafood in my pho- one shrimp, two fish, and one crab piece. 
Overall, we will be back for another visit, food and service was great. :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good! 
I'm still on the hunt for the best pho place in North York but this place was a fairly good contender. 

A few points:
* place was packed and this appears to be a popular spot with many regulars 
* the pho broth tasted great
* the shrimp rolls were also great
* the grilled pork + vermicelli + spring roll was okay. Not bad by any means, but I've had much better
* menu was a bit pricier than most other pho joints 

All in all, not bad!"}
{"text":"Super quick. Super cheap. Super delish!!!! I always get their Pho which is absolutely perfect however tonight I felt like something saucy.... I got their chicken PadThai holy smokes it was good!! Saucy, lots of chicken/tofu and a great size portion! I can't wait to have it again!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic vietnamese food in this area,except it's very salty and seems the soup has lots of MSG in it which contributed to the flavour but personally I care more about the quality.."}
{"text":"WARNING:  if you go on a Saturday you will have to wait, the line was out the door

I ordered some takeout pad thai, and it was ok. Definitely not Thai style but this is a Viet spot so no worries still enjoyed it.

The last time i came i had fried rice with grilled beef and it was extremely good, i recommend everyone try it.

I also had the well done beef pho before and it was pretty good (I'm definitely not a pho expert).  There was not that much meat in it but thats ok as i don't like too much meat. Although the chicken pad thai i had, had tons.

Definitely worth checking out, and avoid weekends if your dining in its insane.  Super clean restaurant, and very friendly staff who have dope electronic name tags!"}
{"text":"I come here quite often with the fam for dinner. This place is fast, but the quality has been going downhill. I usually order the rice plates here. Food is pre-assembled in the kitchen and just warmed up before getting to our table... which is so disappointing how they cut corners and get our food onto the table so fast. I dislike that the food is not made fresh or to order. The food gets cold very fast and tastes bad at that point. Also, the rice is dry and room temperature when served. Maybe its the brand of rice they use, but it just plain sucks. My major complaint is the meat entree (chicken or porkchop) lacks any grill flavour. Stay away from the porkchop it tastes weird af (salty, sweet and sour), instead go w/ chicken if you decide on a rice plate. I have the same complaints towards their soup bowls. Not piping hot, not happy."}
{"text":"One of the better pho places in the area. Great quality, and the broth was very flavourful and complex. I'd definitely recommend exploring the menu a little bit and getting into the vermicelli dishes as well. Their fresh rolls and fried spring rolls are always on point too."}
{"text":"Haven't had chance to try pho, but the rice noodle dish I tried was decent.  Would have liked something a bit spicier but never know whether they were catering to preconception that someone like myself would have a more sensitive palette. Next time I'll have to specify.

Have visited probably 3 dozen times over the past couple years. Consistently good food, and the service is really top notch. I brought a guest that I thought was being overly picky and they apologized profusely. I even tried sticking up for them and they wouldn't bend!"}
{"text":"Authentic, filling and I believe it's owned by Vietnamese folks. Soup base is fresh and served hot.
Lunch time got busy fast and we soon discovered this place draws in a lot of hungry fans during this peak hour.

I regretted ordering the fresh shrimp rolls, all I tasted was mint the whole time. Should've stuck to our all time favourite, the fried spring rolls. Next time for sure.

Nothing really out of the box with expectations but getting what you paid for lands this place as my nearest go to pho restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Pho restaurant in Toronto. The atmosphere is okay. Lots of tables and there is two tvs playing cp24. 
Onto the food, the pho is great! I also loved the spring rolls and the sauce they are served with. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"1st time eating pho in North york. 

Came during family day and I should've expected it to be busy. I was seated at the corner and being a party of 1, this wasn't the best place. I'll explain after.

Food: I ordered the house special in a large size. It wasn't bad, just tasted like any other pho. At least it didn't taste bad or diluted (like some other places I've been to). So it is fair to say that it was yummy and had a lot of meat in it. Large size is good for anyone hungry but people can suffice with medium.

Service: with a full house and just 3 waitresses it is easy to be forgotten if you were just 1 person seated at the corner.  I tried getting the attention of the waitresses by raising my hand but it was uncanny how they kept missing me. After a while my order got in. When it came to paying my bill again I had the challenge of getting their attention. It was funny how they had to turn away patrons saying they are full when I'm trying to actually pay my bill and leave.

Price: I hail from brampton and have my own pho place where I go to. For an XL of the house special i go to I pay 7-8$. here I paid 10.50. Just like in Thai express where you can choose your protein, the price varies here with the choice of protein you select.

Personally I don't see what's great about the pho here. I find it pricey but it might be a cheaper establishment then other places."}
{"text":"Pho Viet Express use to be a hidden gem in my neighbourhood but the word has gotten around and well, they're not so hidden anymore.  But they are definitely a gem.  I eat here at least twice a month.  And that's being modest.

First and to me, most importantly, the owners and staff and chefs are VIET.  Before you pull out the race card on me, hear me out on why this is means something to me.  I'm half Viet and half Chinese and for most of my life, I have eaten some pretty crappy Pho thanks to Asians who are NOT Viet but wanting to make a quick buck.  Maybe I'm old fashion but there are just some ethnic foods that cannot be westernized or fusioned no matter what and Viet cuisine is one of them.

Secondly, the restaurant is clean.  That's important.

Finally, the food here is legit.  Here's a mark of a REAL Viet restaurant:  they will have a noodle soup on their menu called Bon Bo Hue.  If you can find a Viet restaurant that makes a great Bon Bo Hue, you can definitely trust that they'll make a great Pho.  This restaurant does both exceedingly well!  

Their Durian milkshakes actually contain lots of durian (i.e. It isn't watered down) and their Viet coffee will give you all the caffeine kick you need (which is kind of poetic seeing as how they are located two doors beside a Starbucks).

This is a place you must try out if you're craving a legit Viet cuisine experience.  

Happy eatings everyone.

*Tips*
Go for the fresh summer rolls if you're not too hungry but want something to fill you up nicely.

Saturday dinner rush and Sunday lunch rush can get packed all the way to the door so go at your own risk."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 star rating. Based on yelp reviews I wanted to try this place as I've been wanting to find a pho place in my neighbourhood that has great food. We got take out here on a Saturday soon after they opened for the day. The food is good. They use the thin vermicelli noodles that we love. The spring rolls were good too. We might eat here again. Still not as delicious in my mind as Pho Vietnam but better than Angus Pho which we tried a couple weeks ago."}
{"text":"Again stupid Yelp reviewers who don't know shit about food. Went here based on high ratings and guess what... Crappy food again, when will people who have no taste buds stop doing reviews? The soup was bland and the meats were little bits of crap. Thank you useless Yelp reviewers."}
{"text":"A Pho place close to home, can I be happier? Yes, because it is a good, tasty, even rather delicious Pho place close to home!
Notes on the Pho: good clean broth, well flavored, no or very little MSG detected, plenty of toppings and condiments, slurpy noodles, variety of meats, arrives in a blink of an eye.
Notes on other foods: Mango salad is OK, fresh rolls have too much lettuce, pad thai, omg why did I order Thai dish in a Vietnamese resto?
Service: Attentive and friendly.
Decor: Minimal, not distracting from Pho.
Price: Code word \"Affordable\"

I hope and pray so the quality of their Pho remains the same with time."}
{"text":"Been here twice recently. Their noodles are pretty good. However, curry chicken rice is soso. I will go back for their noodles for sure."}
{"text":"Clean location, quick service, good quality food with appropriate prices. You can't go wrong with visiting."}
{"text":"I get the idea that this is the local go-to for pho by how busy this place is. Service is remarkably fast, with food on the table within 15 min of ordering. I would say the bun bo hue is above average, but pricy portion wise. The Xpress pho's broth is acceptable, in that it is good and meets the high standards set by its peers in the area. The fried spring rolls were okay---they are noticeably better than your garden variety Manchu Wok spring rolls but they don't have that pleasingly crispy/blistered texture nor was the filling exceptionally delicious. The drinks were okay---we prefer our Viet coffee NOT pre-made and to allow us to have the phin filter and control the ratio of condensed milk. At this point, everything was at least acceptable. Where I mark down a star is the pad thai. The plate of neon orange seafood pad thai tasted like they completely swapped tamarind for ketchup and the shrimp (which was distinctly different from the tail-on shrimp in the bun bo hue; that was fine) tasted like they left it out to defrost too long---very fishy. Overall, this place was a touch more expensive, value/portion-wise compared to its competitors."}
{"text":"Big portions and low prices, that sums up my review. The small bowl of Pho I got was very big, a large according to my standards. I've been in the plaza sooooo many times, but somehow never paid attention to this restaurant. I came on a Thursday night. The restaurant is clean, spacious and even though the waitresses don't speak much English, they still pay attention to your order and try to help you decide on what to order. I had the seafood Pho (rice noodle). The Pho was delicious. There's a side of bean sprouts and fresh herbs that you can add to your dish. Tip: cash or debit only! don't expect any Wifi"}
{"text":"Came here on a friends recommendation, it being her #1 pho place.

Located in a small plaza, parking is limited but we were able to pretty easily get a spot.

Pretty big inside and quite clean which I was impressed with (some pho places are always freezing and dutty).

Ordered a spring roll to share and I got a rare beef and beef ball pho and my bf got tripe, tendon and brisket pho. 

Spring rolls weren't good. Not the usual wrapping that you get at pho restaurants (which is what makes pho spring rolls so amazing), but more of the chinese spring roll shell, and the rolls were dry and pretty bland.

The broth of the pho was decent and the noodles not bad. The downfall to the soup was the lack of ingredients. There was SO little meat in each of our bowls. I have been to more pho restaurants than I can count on both hands and I have never seen such cheap meat portions. I got three tiny beef balls and 4 small pieces of rare beef in a large soup. Stingy! 

Even tho this is now in walking distance for us, we won't go back. We would still rather make the trek to pho angus or pho metro or 88, even in the dead of winter, for some proper spring rolls and non-stingy pho."}
{"text":"Hit or miss on food, mostly a hit. Clean restaurant compared to other Viet restaurants. Good portion. Prices are $1 more compared to other Pho restaurant. 
Service is okay. They messed up my order and claimed on me once but I let that slide because I like it than any other Viet restaurants in GTA."}
{"text":"Definitely a great pho place in GTA. Soup is clean and delicious. I wish their tea tasted better but their food is great whether it's pho noodle soup, rice platter, or vermicelli. I haven't tried other items on the menu but they all look pretty good. The servers are more friendly than other pho places. If you're looking for a clean tasting pho noodle soup, this place is it. There's usually huge wait at peak hours which speaks for the freshness of their food."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto from Orange County, California and looking for a Vietnamese restaurant . I was so happy with the food and service here. They are nice, clean and serve food very quick , less than 15 minutes waiting! I highly recommend this place to who loves pho, hu tieu nam vang, bun bo hue. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Pho soup around! Love their soups and their appetizers! we go there with the family at least once a week... their prices are very good! will definatly recommend this place to anyone looking for great soup!"}
{"text":"not very fancy but good quality food and good service.
their service is fast and lots of variety to select.Very reasonable price"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho spot. The food is always delicious and the broth is great! Also, it helps that the servers are on top of things unlike other Asian style cuisine. Thier mango salad is too good!"}
{"text":"I was recommended this place for a good but quick and easy meal, and i was a little disappointed. Pricing wise its the same as many other viet restaurants, but the quality was meh. 

We ordered shrimp bun bo hue, house special pho, chicken spring rolls, pad thai, viet coffee and 3 coloured drink. 

The bun bo hue was quite nice, probably my fav out of all the things we ordered. The pad thai was very orange, so you can tell they used ketchup instead of tamarind mixture. The house special came with lots of toppings, but I felt like the broth was a little off, either too salty or a little too much msg. Nothing compared to the rich broth you can get at Pho Tai Bac. 

However, what upset me the most was the viet coffee. From someone who visited vietnam earlier this year and fell in love with their coffee culture, the coffee I got from this place tasted like it was instant coffee. Slightly dusty in texture and not very rich. 

Overall the most impressive thing from this place is the speed they bring up the food. Quick, but dont expect much from the quality."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices, quick sevice, good hygiene.  Anybody can enjoy at anytime.  Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"My number go to pho place in the neighbourhood. 

I don't even need a menu!!! I just write my 302B medium on a rainy day then i'd be full and happy by the end of my meal!!! Also they got great service.  maybe cause i'm a regular? 

Try the vermicelli chicken and pork! It's flavourful as expected!!"}
{"text":"One of the rising stars in the restaurant business in this area. Service is outstanding. Food is amazing"}
{"text":"The best pho restaurant in the area. The broth is excellent, the meat is fresh and the service is friendly. Try out the grilled meat balls and fried spring rolls for an extra bit of zing to your meal."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the new location. Very glad they opened a minute walk from my workplace! Had the pho as usual. Same great depth of flavor as original location and generous quanitity. Pho in general is pricier in Woodbridge so their prices are justified here. Oh, also saw the front desk lady working here from other location. Apparently she has to work both locations now"}
{"text":"amazing quantity and quality. and they give 3 leaves of culantro with the pho, love it. 5/5

EDIT: 
For the new 2018 year, the new Large is the old medium and new XL is the old large. Prices have also increased by $2.. I can understand the price should go up this year because of the new minimum wage and all, but a size down and $2 increase on top of that is a bit drastic.."}
