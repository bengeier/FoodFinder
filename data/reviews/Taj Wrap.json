{"text":"*Update 2: Ok....I love this place. Shawarma wrap has really improved and owner is nice. Plus he seems to have hired more people. I didn't like the gyro at all but that has more to do with that not being my type of food. The burgers are still avg but I'm gonna judge a shawarma place more based on the actual shawarma and this is just as good as Pita Nutso for me now and slightly better than Osmow's/Isis.

*Updating my last review because I think this place has improved. The shawarma is definitely better now and they have a generous group buy deal through teambuy and some other sites here you get $10 worth of food for $5 which is pretty nice. They've also maintained a nice clean atmosphere and their business seems to have picked up. The service every time I go here is really good. If you don't want the pita to be cold then ask them to toast it and also you have to try it out a few times to figure out how much sauce or whatever you want...each shawarma place is different.

Sometimes when I go there for lunch and only the owner is there without the other people then it gets a bit slow if multiple people are ordering (not as slow as Osmow's during busy hours but not as fast as Pita Nutso/Isis) but usually it's not that busy. However if the owner can afford it since his business seems to have picked up, it would help if he got a 2nd person to come in during lunch to help out. As long as the prices are good and the shawarma stays good then I'd love to go here.
--------------------------------------------
Pretty good when it comes to the actual shawarma (Pita Nutso and Osmow's are slightly better but it's good to try go somewhere else once in a while). They also have hamburgers and gyros unlike some of the other nearby halal places although they need to improve them. The prices are good, shawarma wrap or burger plus pop for $4.99 (for now anyways) which is helpful for a UTMs students who want to get a quick lunch.

They also let you choose the shawarma ingredients (skip the cabbage lol). The restaurant is also nice and clean with more sitting room than the other two. It's not as visible because you have to walk a few metres into Pearl St after turning from Queen street so not sure if it'll get much business but I hope it stays and I wanna try out some other stuff from there."}
{"text":"Very happy to see a new shawarma place in Streetsville. The only other shawarma restaurant in the area isn't that great (unless you want only meat and greasy sauce with no lettuce). I got a huge shawarma with tons of fresh toppings (tabouleh, tomatoes, picked turnip, lettuce, two types of onion, green pepper, pickles and cucumber) for only 4.99 with a free drink. It wasn't the best I've ever had, but still very tasty and great value. I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I ordered a chicken shawarma and I didn't find it incredibly tasty or mouth-watering. There was too much lettuce in the wrap which I think overshadowed the flavours from the rest of the ingredients. As well, the pita was cold and dripping with oil.

Nonetheless, their prices are very reasonable so I may come back and try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I eat chicken shawarma at Taj Wrap about 1 time a week.  I live 2 minutes drive from Taj Wrap.  So far, in my opinion this is the best in Streetsville but I do have to confess I have not tried the other 2 in years.  I do know a good Shawarma though.

Usually I just pull up in front, park and walk in.  They are not as busy as they should be.  I think it's because they are around the corner and easy missed if you just drive through.  I order the Chicken Shawwarma and the coke as it's only like 5.64 with tax I think..  The cook asks me what I want and because they have a full display of all the fresh veggies, and other goodies, I tell him exactly what I like.  I love Tabbouleh, so I ask for extra.  Depending on my mood I have them adjust the sauce.  That's the oil part.  So if you don't like anything, just ask him NOT to put it in.  For me, sometimes I don't like it heated up, because by the time I get to eat it, the lettuce becomes a bit soggy, so I just microwave for 30 seconds.  But each to his own.  I have tried some of their other food, and so far it has been great  But... in November I ordered a plate, and it came with french fries... It was just terrible so I have not ordered that since then.  I was talking to the cook today, and he assured me that they do not use that brand/style of chip anymore.  He even said they have also made home cut fries.  Very few places do that these days.  I highly suggest you ask for them, as I will ask next time I'm there.

We are lucky that there is actually 3 places that have Chicken Shawarma, all in a very close area.  I highly suggest if u like Shawarma, try all 3, and make your own choice.  After writing this review, I will make a point to try the other 2 since it's been years.

Pita - fresh
Meat - chicken fresh and good.
Choice of veggies - good and fresh
Drinks - cold 
Service - Fast and polite

I read the review that Jeff M. wrote.  That is very sad.  For two reasons;

1. Jeff M. should never have had to go through that.  
2. The restaurant is not like this.  It was just a very bad day.

I actually heard from the cook who Jeff M. had the worst experience with.  The cook admits error.  He went on to explain that his friend was helping at cash but didn't know about things a cashier should.  

Maybe the owner of the restaurant can find a way to contact Jeff M. and resolve this. 

I really like Taj Wrap as you can see.   Taj Wrap is very clean, and the food is excellent.

{"text":"I was walking by, when I noticed that a new shawarma place had opend up here in Streetsville. Growing up in the middle east, Arabic food is my comfort food (Not just Shawarmas, kanefes, kibbeh, but also mansaf, gaboot etc) They're my go-to comfort food, so I couldn't resist checking it out. 

For $4.99, you can get a shawarma wrap + pop. It might be their opening special, so not sure how long it will last, but it's a great price. I got a huge pita, stuffed with chicken and smothered in garlic and tahini sauces The chicken was liberally spiced, and the sauces were tangy. . Then grilled to seal in the goodness. The only thing is it was quite greasy, but it was quite delicious. 

Their menu seems to have the standard Middle eastern fare - hummus, kibbeh, falafels etc. Will have to go back to try some of the other stuff!"}
