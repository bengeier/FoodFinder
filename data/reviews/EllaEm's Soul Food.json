{"text":"We always make our way here when we visit Vegas. Never disappoints, always delicious and plenty of food for everyone. Server was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered the oxtail dinner.  It came with a choice of three sides.  We got mashed potatoes and gravy, collard greens, and macaroni and cheese.  Everything was absolutely delicious!!  And portions are HUGE.  definitely worth the money. Service was friendly and fast.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in Las Vegas I go here for some great soul food. The meatloaf is abundant and tasty and the fried chicken is just like Grandma used to make. They give you three sides with each meal and it's so much food there's no way to eat it all. I haven't tried the pork chop dinner yet, but it looks great and I'm excited to try it next time I'm in town. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem! I had the catfish, which was a bit too salty, but delicious (hey, it's soul food after all). The cornbread was the best I've ever had. 

The service was prompt and very friendly, as was the rest of the crowd. As a transracial family with an adopted son from Haiti, we weren't sure what kind of reception we would receive in a soul food restaurant. It was not an issue. We felt very welcomed, and EllaEm's does a great job of demonstrating pride in their heritage. 

It was a great experience overall, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good one of the better soul food places in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food is probably the best soul food I ever had. Got fried chicken,red beans,greens and black eye peas.It was amazing although I had to have a doggy bag because the portions are big. Staff was very kind and friendly. Definitely will be back..Best in Soul Food in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Great food. The meat fell right off the bones of my smothered chicken. My dining partner's fried catfish was perfect, both seasoning and texture. They have delicious greens, yams, and red beans as well.

Only problem was the service. It was maybe half full, but the two on staff seemed a little overwhelmed. My hopeful guess is that their experienced wait staff works the busier days."}
{"text":"OMG! Great Soul Food.  Our first time there today and will definitely go back.
Had the catfish, which was perfect and the best collard greens I have ever eaten.
Be sure and try the yams too, oh so yummy!! They also know how to make sweet
tea, and portions are large. Service was GREAT!"}
{"text":"I have been really wanting to try this restaurant for a while, but every time I would try and go they would be closed. When I thought about them this time they were just getting ready to close. So we ordered and took the food home. It was just ok, there was nothing exciting about the food. Everything could have used more flavor. I don't think it made that much difference that we took the food home. 

We ordered the Catfish, Snapper and Meatloaf dinners(which came with three sides each.) All of them were dry and needed more flavor. The meatloaf, 1/2 inch thick with gravy, almost seemed like it was processed and had no juice, flavor, texture or color (like bell peppers, onions, tomato anything. The Snapper and Catfish were both fried and were very thinly cut. 

They give you a nice amount of food for the cost. We had Mac & Cheese, Black Eye Peas, Fried Cabbage, Greens, and Yams. I loved the fried cabbage. The Yams were good, but could have used a tad more nutmeg. The meal came with cornbread muffins that were dry and boring. 

The Black Eye Peas just tasted like Peas, and my 10 year old makes better Mac and Cheese. Not only could I not find the cheese but I could find any flavor. It was not the traditional Black Mac and Cheese that is baked with cheese. Greens were ok, nothing to discuss. 

The worst part was the Peach Cobbler. I was excited when I saw the Peach Cobbler picture on the website, it looked delicious and flavorful. Instead of Peach Cobbler, I received two bowls of dough with maybe two peaches. I warmed it up for 45 secs like they suggested but that did not make any difference. It tasted like peach flavored bread, not like a cobbler at all. 

The only thing that was good, was the service. They were friendly when I placed the order over the phone and when I picked it up."}
{"text":"I've been in Las Vegas for a year not going out to eat much but I love oxtails. My sister came to visit last wknd from Cali and I found this place looking for bbq. The people are friendly and the oxtails were very good. Will be going back to try other items."}
{"text":"I'm from Mississippi, but I have lived overseas for a few years.. I am in Vegas for a while and the choices for food are very vast! When I discovered a soul food place I didn't think it could be anything like home, but this place pleasantly surprised me... Man, am I happy! I haven't had greens like this since I was a kid! They even have the pepper sauce on the table! I know the catfish Capitol of the world is in Belzoni, but this place gives it a run for its money!! Everything seems to be made with love in your granny's kitchen. I will keep coming back here because it feels like home, and that is good for my SOUL!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was so good, I was going to completely ignore the waffle. But the waffle was also amazing, a perfect compliment to the chicken. I also really enjoyed the kool aid and the cornbread pancakes."}
{"text":"Found them tucked away while searching for a quick bite for me and two kiddos under 4. Short and sweet...this is the purest and freshest soul I've had in a while and we just moved from the south. Firstly,  we were greeted by a really nice staff who had recommendations ready.  I went with the fried cat fish and chose mac n cheese, collard greens, black eyed peas, and an extra side of fried okra. The meal also came with corn bread muffins and they even gave me a couple extra for the kids and my hubby who had the leftovers. The muffins were moist and light in sweetness and density,  delicious and balanced. The fried fish and okra had a great batter and were cooked perfectly and didn't have an oily taste. The collards and beans were so fresh, not fatty, and tasted great; my kids loved them. My kids didn't go for the mac n cheese, but only because their taste buds are ruined by the boxed stuff. I will be back again.  There aren't many choices along Craig for those nights I don't feel like cooking and you can go easy on the wallet and waist line if you split the meal and get an extra side ir two or you can go grilled and stick to veggie options. The desserts looked great...maybe next time."}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm coming from Detroit and the soul food here is on point.  To compare,  I ordered the fire chicken meal which you can select two sides.  I chose the rice with gravy and veggies.  I also got a side of the Mac N Cheese. The chicken had the best seasoning and was perfectly cooked. The Mac n cheese was awesome!  We also ordered their corn bread which were baked in a cup like a cupcake.  I felt like I lost alot of the bread with it getting stuck to the paper.  Otherwise,  really good.  

The ambience is quite dark... But the service is great.  We got our food a little bit before closing and they were so welcome to let us dine in.  

Great place for the soul food cravings"}
{"text":"The service was excellent!! The food was delicious. I had the catfish and it was yummy, fried nice and crispy and juicy!! My sides where yams, greens and red beans and rice!  Yams were seasoned perfectly, greens were very flavorful and the red beans and rice was full of perfect combination of spices!  I will definitely come back again!  My hunnie had the smothered chicken with brown gravy, it was a good balance of seasonings and the gravy was full of flavor, it definitely provided a good balance to the chicken!!  He also had yams, greens, and he had black eyed peas which was delicious !!!  The cornbread muffin they serve reminding me of my mama!! So definitely 2 thumbs up!!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Went in on our last night in Vegas, so it wasn't crowded. The service was good & the place was neat & clean. We had oxtail. Short ribs, fried chicken, snapper, greens, fried okra, candied yams, rice & gravy, Mac & cheese and fried cabbage. Everything was superb!! The food had lots of seasoning & flavor to it. We're definitely going back there when we come back to Vegas!!! Thank you Ellaem's for making our last night a memorable one!!"}
{"text":"Best soul food in Vegas by far!!! Great service!! Thanks Alyson and Q! I enjoyed the Ox tails and baby back ribs. Boom!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review while waiting for our order. My husband and I got a craving for some fried catfish, and being near our house and having it once before, we called this place for take out. Now, the food is good. Not outstanding but good and just a little pricey. Still, convenience and cravings win out. But this is my complaint, we called in an order for pick up. We wanted to avoid the wait and have a night in. Asked if it would be ready by 6:30, I called at called at 5:40, they said yes. My husband got there ten minutes late and he is still there waiting for our food thirty minutes later. Bad service? Yes...


*** update- after waiting thirty more minutes for our takeout, a food server just sets the bag of food in front of my husband without a word and walks away. No courtesy what so ever."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was great and the food was good! We had the oxtail dinner and meatloaf lunch special. The fried cabbage was spectacular! Sweet Tea wasn't great but I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I typically don't write reviews but in this case, I'd have to. My family of 5 came in as soon as the place opened. It took us over an hour to get our food. With 3 little kids, that didn't go so well. There was only 1 waitress for the entire place. During the time we were waiting on our food, there were 2 different group of customers that walked out because of how slow everything was. 
I ordered the oxtail, which was pretty tasty (a bit salty for my taste though). My husband ordered the fried fish, wasn't too bad and my oldest ordered the chicken and waffles, which I found disappointing as 3 or 4 chicken wings were given(I was expecting big chicken pieces for the price we paid), scrambled eggs and a stack of waffles. Everything was a bit pricey. If you're craving for soul food, I'd recommend this place; however, I don't think I'll be back again due to lack of good service and long wait."}
{"text":"The waitress Jazzland was awesome. My mother and grandma came in from Ohio and she showed us some true hospitality. The food is also good, but the service will have me back! Ask for her it's worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon EllaEm's randomly one night. The service was top notch. I ordered the Fried Chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the Smoothered Chicken. I am giving the location a 3-star only because I wasn't a big fan of the sandwich. My husband truly enjoyed his dish. From what I was able to try without being attacked, my husband's Smoothered Chicken was great! I noticed everyone says you have to try the gravy, yes the gravy is good. I however, LOVED the corn bread."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great customer service. Visited on 5/25/16. The owner should be very proud. Visitor's from Washington D.C. and Tifton, GA."}
{"text":"If I could pick 1/2 a star I would, my little cousin ordered the chicken strips. Half way through the chicken strips she mentions that the chicken tasted funny, my aunt checks the chicken and the chicken is raw. So we notify the waitress and she was very understanding and apologetic and offered to compensate us for the raw chicken (like any professional waitress would do). Long story short whoever the manager is made us pay for the replacement meal, this is a perfect example of bad customer service. If my 9 year old cousin gets sick from eating this establishments raw chicken we will be seeing you in court."}
{"text":"For starters four of us walked in and all four orders were wrong then we get home we check to see the orders and we took a bite out of somebody else's food brought it back to them and they tried to give it to the customer when he showed up if it weren't for the fact that he said I want my food fresh he could have brawl we know gotten age from somebody's food that they got taken out of the store and brought back. Then the attitude that the girl up front and Davis when we asked for you know something and compensation for being screwed over she said that we didn't tip and that's why it was order was screwed up. In all honesty we gave her a cheerleader $6 for $40 ticket I mean she got tipped well so in my opinion what are the worst places in town... I give the food to the service of a half a point and the restaurant cleanliness 1."}
{"text":"Julian, This place Is The best In The West for real.  When you want Soul food At It's
Core, Go there once, and You'll go back for more."}
{"text":"This place has great soul food, my chicken was a little salty for my taste but , yams, beans ect were delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious place to eat.  Alison is a wonderful waitress and very friendly.  Second day in a row we decided to come back for more."}
{"text":"Fried chicken, rice and gravy, cabbage and Mac and Cheese was great! Also tried the collard greens and ribs. Everything was delicious! Kyle, our server, was very nice and attentive. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that served liver and onions in Las Vegas. I googled it and it listed this place that only a few miles away. My husband I went for dinner and we were welcomed when we walked in. Our waiter was great. Service was great and my liver & onions was just the way I like them. Also got collard greens, Mac n cheese and mashed. Husband got pork chops, 3 of them. We were shocked. Great meal, met new friends and were so full we  could barely walk, no room for dessert."}
{"text":"Just finished my first lunch here. Ordered the catfish sandwich for pick-up which was ready in a timely manner. 

Greens were on point. 
Catfish was on point.
Cornbread was on point. 

Will order again."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday from hearing from a friend the food was great .great customer service I love seafood so the red snapper was on hit too bad I'm not from the area"}
{"text":"Really good soul food only been here a couple times today I got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, collard greens and Mac n cheese everything was finger licking good I've also gotten the catfish before I just love this place it's worth the wait every time and make sure to come hungry the portions are big but you'll eat every bite!"}
{"text":"Went during their lunch special hours and everything was  great! Good customer service, great food and nice prices.

Catfish & chicken and waffles 

Will recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"I've only been here once for lunch and the food was really good. The only reason I don't give it five stars is due to the dining area. They need to rearrange how the room is set up in my opinion. When you walk in, it's not clear if it's a take out place or not. Other than that, the staff was nice and the food was good."}
{"text":"A solid offering in the Soul Food/Southern category. The food is good. Admittedly, I have had better fried chicken elsewhere, but EllaEm's does it justice. Also tried the fried fish - great!  Not too greasy.  Southern food wouldn't be complete without sides, and here, EllaEm's also shines. Collard greens, mac and cheese, red beans, black eyed peas - all excellent! IMO, the standout was the yams.  

I didn't have a problem with the service here, unlike others' experience.  It was a bit on the slow side - so not good if you're in a time crunch. However, the staff are friendly.  I think this is a family business, which I'm always fond of supporting whenever possible.

Decor is casual, and the price isn't too bad (especially for Vegas standards)."}
{"text":"I ordered two pork chop plates and peach cobbler to go. When I got home there was no peach cobbler or any rice. I had to drive back which took me 25mins. Upon returning the waitress with the short gold ponytail who took order was rude. She grabbed bags sent the food back in the kitchen which I thought was unsanitary and yelled for the cooks to put rice on top of my pork chops. I asked if they were allowed to do so and she said yes. She was very unprofessional and mad at me as if it was my fault that my order was incorrect. She threw everything back in the back and gave me a free peach which was watery. The pork chops were tough as you can see I ate one and gave rest to my dog. I spent $41.06 for nothing had I not drove back before I would have driven back to get my refund!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is worth getting off the strip. The portions are HUGE. My boyfriend had the Catfish dinner with 3 sides of Mac-n-cheese, yams and rice smothered with gravy. I had the catfish sandwich with fries. The catfish is amazing, succulent and spiced just right. (We went to a much more expensive Southern restaurant later in the week and I ordered the catfish which was dryed out!) 
The sides including the fries were all wonderful. We will definitely go back later this year when we're in Vegas again.  We're dying for the catfish again and try some new items! 
I highly recommend making the 20 minute drive to North Las Vegas to eat here and then hit one of the Station Casinos as well."}
{"text":"OMG it was off the hook!!!Everything me and my husband ate was bomb! The mac-n-cheese is heaven on earth! The yams was like a party in my mouth and the ribs good lawd they were like silk on my tongue.will be back everytime we are in vegas. Customer service was on point also."}
{"text":"Had lunch 1/30/15, was awesome food. Reminded me if great food from the south. I had the meat loaf with the \"Red sauce\"...yummy! My waiter \"Q\" was very helpful..knew what to order! JV"}
{"text":"If you're in north town and craving some good ol' fashioned soul food, you definitely gotta try this place out! Their prices are good for the amount you get and the inside is very clean and welcoming, considering the poor location choice, which is in a plaza on Craig road and Revere -where stores are constantly closing and new businesses open left and right. If it is your first time and want something other than their really good fried chicken, YOU MUST TRY THE FRIED CATFISH! I don't know what they do to the catfish, but there is no fishy taste at all. (you know what I'm talking about) It's very clean tasting and the seasoning and batter is not overpowering, making this light crispy fish a must try. The sides totally compliment the food and leave me stuffed and satisfied. If you're thinking this is just your ordinary soul food joint think again, there's plenty of SOUL and HEART stirring up in this kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, the food is delicious and Kim was outstanding in assisting us. We will definitely return for a visit when we're in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"We came all way from the bay area, the food and service was the bomb!!!! Shout out Q, he had good service and great hospitality,  wonderful personality,  food was hot and fresh love love love it"}
{"text":"I was Visiting Vegas for my Girls B day and we stopped in hoping to have some great soul food and Ella Ems did not disapoint ! The wait staff was very friendly  and we were seated quickly and with a smile! I order the Catfish , mac and cheese and greens and every bite was delish! There portions are huge and prices are very good! I could not finish everything and had to take some back with me but it was so good @ 3am coming back from a long night out! If great Soul Food is what your in the Mood for make sure u pay this spot a Visit !!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding the atmosphere was stellar cozy comfortable made me feel like I was back at home in Greensboro North Carolina and the service was exemplary especially this one waitress named Allison she was fast efficient courteous lovely effervescent smile and extremely friendly. This is one place that I tell you you have to take your family and friends the prices were affordable and that's a sticking point with me because so many so called soul food restaurants in Las Vegas the food is so overpriced its not even funny but here the food is extremely well priced and you get great portions so hats off to this great establishment 20 stars in my book I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great Soul Food - Highly Recommend!
 - Vegas does not offer a lot of great soul food spots and after dining at M&M, this is the only soul food place in town. 
- The prices are reasonable. 
- The OX Tails are my FAV!!

* Dislike:  Toward the end of the night within the last half hour -they toss out the FOOD, I guest to clean up.  So you may not be able to buy certain foods at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Ella Ems  is a nice restaurant very clean. I ordered the oxtail with and entree you get three sides. I chose the yams , mash potato's and mac n cheese. , you think i got enough carbs?
               The oxtails were excellant meaty ,tender  and moist in a very good brown gravy. Portion size on the oxtails were small , I received 3 med sized pieces. Mash potatos  were solid . Yams were amazing , very flavorful. Some of the best yams ever ate. The mac n cheese on the other hand were very disappointing. No cheese flavor very, very bland. They also serve cornbread which was very good , a little sweet, how us yankee's like it as my mother in law would say. Overall pretty happy with the meal"}
{"text":"I expected the food to be really good but it just okay. I wouldnt recommend or go back. I ordered 5 meals for my family to go. So we had just about every side they offer on the menu. The only thing good was the potato salad and cornbread. The meats were good, the chicken and pork chops. The service was pretty decent. Also not sure if it was just the day we were there, but it was HOT in there. Also they offered a few different dessert but was out of all of them. i thought that was odd. The servers and cashiers were really nice."}
{"text":"Great service even though the place was packed and there was only one waitress.  Awesome lunch menu."}
{"text":"Home style at its best! Gave the true sense of comfort food with every bite. I entered hungry, grossly overate from the generous portions, and left miserably satisfied and overwhelmingly content. What more can a man ask for?"}
{"text":"We have been reading reviews for Ellla Ems for some time now and always wanted to try it. This past Sunday we were planning on trying breakfast at the new \"Lumberjack's\" restaurant on Craig rd. but when we arrived there was a 30 minute wait and we decided to see if Ella Ems served breakfast. They do not really serve breakfast but the waiter recommend the chicken & waffles which you could order with or without 2 eggs. All 3 in our party ordered the chicken and waffles with eggs. Everything came out hot, and everything on the plate was delicious. The fried chicken was excellent, the waffle fresh and a good size, two eggs were cooked just how we ordered them. We will be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food !! The first bite took me back home to the South !! Best Fried Chicken ! We will definitely be coming here frequently"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times the food is always great I just started trying the OXTAIL and it's amazing. This is an all around great place I would recommend to anyone. The customer service is wonderful I had the pleasure of being served by two lovely young ladies Anisha and Allison they make me feel like family :). Thank you will be back!"}
{"text":"I like this place, good atmosphere,  good music, good food and pretty waitresses Navi and Anisha. I had the fried catfish and macaroni &cheese greens and fries. Fries were great, catfish better then Mari os. Will return"}
{"text":"EllaEm's catered an event for us last week and it was out of this world. All of our friends are from the south east and they could not quit raving about how awesome the food was! Fried chicken, mac&cheese, greens, red beans, okra, potato salad--- all perfect! If you want real, southern soul food with amazing customer service, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Omg.... If I could've given more stars I would. Being from the southeast I am picky about southern food. My Boyfriend and I both ordered the smothered fried chicken. The chicken was perfectly crispy and juicy. The gravy was tasty. Our sides were fresh and delicious. We ended our meal with the peach cobbler. It was perfect! Even the atmosphere was soothing. Great place for a date or family dinner."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS!!! Allyson was great as our server. The yams are amazing. We will definitely come back again!!  ;-)"}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner here on Friday night after reading some of the reviews. 
My fiancée is from NC so his taste buds are hard to please when it comes to southern food. Upon entering there were 3 ladies (servers I assume, they were all wearing black) and one couple having dinner. The decor is nice and enjoyed the \"home-like\" feeling of the Granny pictures. They must have satellite radio and the best radio station ever, it was warm, inviting, and even a little romantic at times with the selection of music, soul, jazz and R&B. The server immediately came to our table and took our drink order. My Fiancée had the fried chicken dinner with greens, Mac n cheese and yams. I enjoyed the catfish with the same three sides except I had the mashed potatoes instead of yams. They were all very large portions, the food was nice and hot and yes, everyone is right, the corns bread is pretty yummy...................but can we talk about the catfish????
Even if you are not a fish lover, you should try this!!!! It is crispy on the outside, the breading or whatever they use is not to thick or overpowering, it's perfectly seasoned and crunchy, but wait, when you get to the fish.....OH MY! It is like butter; it melts in your mouth and is so delicious you would never even think it is fish. Definitely the best WE have ever had (yes I had to share, the meal was large)
I am not from the south, but have visited NC and eaten catfish at many other places before and this is by far the best I have ever had. The server, ( I am sorry I do not remember her name) was also very helpful, when I explained this was our first time there and may need assistance suggesting dessert, was very pleasant and helpful. As they got busier, (many people were coming in to pick up to-go orders) and three more parties came in, we were constantly checked by the other servers, asking not only if we were ok but if there was anything else they can get for us.
Overall, we were extremely happy and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The oxtails are delicious & so is the fried cabbage. Que has such a great personality & is very personable. 
It's definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"The food's great but the service leaves something to be desired.

One time for dinner, we waited for an hour for our food. After inquiring as to the status, they said it was still another 10 minutes. We just paid for our drinks and cornbread and left.

We've been here a couple of times before but this'll be the last; the service has gradually gotten worse.

The review was updated from a 5 star."}
{"text":"Keeping the same 3 stars. Today I tried their fried chicken and same 3 sides as last time. The chicken was good. The yams and greens are great. The Mac n cheese is the nastiest Mac n cheese I've ever tasted. It's pretty much plain macaroni with some clumps of fake cheese that doesn't coat the macaroni. The corn bread muffins are still way too small. I will still get some veggies from this place but that's about it."}
{"text":"Mrs. A..... I have read the \"Complaint\" that you have wrote and I have come to this conclusion.... You are NOT keeping it real, you are just the bitter \"ex-worker\" who got fired... I find this VERY unprofessional of you. I'm not going to go back and forth with you, but because you posted your childish complaint with my name, I felt the NEED to reply. - Keep this in mind - \"To Each is his own\" - My experience, If you want some good soul food, great atmosphere, good owner as well as servers and cooks... Go to EllaEm's and try it out for yourself....

*Be aware of bitter ex-servers, they'll sabotage anything... Smoooccchheeezz!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I usually go to M & M's when I want soul food, but I was on the complete opposite side of town. I found this place and I love it! 

I had my 2 year old with me and most waiters I'm sure cringe at my active 2 year old, but my waitress was great! Every time she came to our table she played with him. I never had to ask for a refill and she was very kind.

The food was great! My son and I shared the smothered chicken lunch special with mac and cheese and greens, and it was very filling! My son is picky but he loved the chicken and mac too!

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice place if you love soul food.  Loved especially the catfish.  All food was fresh and the hot food was indeed piping hot.  Great service as well.  Will be coming back there when possible!"}
{"text":"First time trying but will definitely will be back to try more .I had the rack of ribs , with Mac and cheese,fried cabbage and a peach cobbler . Everything I had delicious ! Next time I'm wanting to try the oxtail"}
{"text":"The Ox tails are to die for. I went here away from the strip after looking for soul food. It did not disappoint. This is the best soul food I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant plenty of times and I have never been disappointed. It has an intimate coffee shop vibe to it. It's a great place for a date, lunch with friends, family or co-workers. Normally spend time gossiping over a plate of authentic soul food. The cornbread here is buttery, fresh and baked to perfection. I can never get  enough of that. The entree comes with 2-3 sides which are plentiful. 
They do not take long making your food at all. It's a very homestyle feel. The customer service is perfect. They aren't over bubbly, in your face or checking on you too much. 

Ella Em's is outstanding! 5/5"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Super nice and really accommodating. We came in with  a group of 12 and they totally took care of us.  The chicken was fantastic and I loved the corn bread!"}
{"text":"A good neighborhood soul food place. Good food. Good service. Good environment. Relaxing."}
{"text":"Really good southern food. Great place for all your cravings for soul food. Gotta give it up to miss ella em."}
{"text":"I am from Louisiana an I can say they have sum of the best fried catfish I've had here in Vegas. I didn't care too much for the Mac n cheese, but the fried cabbage an yams were definitely on point..."}
{"text":"Awesome and amazing doesn't do justice!!!! We had never been before but we are certainly going back. Three people three different meals three amazingly happy people! 
The fried chicken was the best I have ever had from a restaurant. The cat fish was beyond expectations! The oxtail was so good! With each entree you get three sides. The cabbage and greens were the best I have ever had (please don't tell my mom and Granny). The mac and cheese was homemade and so good! The yams made me long for Thanksgiving! 
Yet the best part of this entire place was the service!!! Kimberly was so friendly and warm. She gave great suggestions on the food and was spot on!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best soul food in Vegas. My husband and I have been here 10 times. The food is true southern cooking, not too salty, seasoned just right!! I can't even tell you what to get EVERYTHING we've ordered has been spot on.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is related to their to go service. We have ordered take out 3 times, all those times they forgot to put the cornbread in the bag! There cornbread is DELICIOUS!! If you've ever had it, you understand my frustration! No biggie tho, I should've learned my lesson after the first n started checking the bag,  now if we order to go, we check the bag before we leave. 
The staff is always friendly. I would definitely recommend trying this place if you're looking for some good authentic soul food. 
Be sure to check your bag before u leave with takeout!!"}
{"text":"I had a great meal at EllaEms today.  The fried chicken with gravy on the side, mac & cheese, collard greens, and cornbread were all delicious. My waitress (I can't remember her name) was awesome. She kept the refills coming she made sure that we were well taken care of and she was very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat authentic soul food. Food and service was beyond attentive."}
{"text":"This is a small place in a strip mall. It only seats 47 people. The sweet tea sucks. I can critique it being I grew up on it. Now, The menu is simple. This time I got the pork chops smothered (gravy of course)....Fried cabbage, black eyed peas, and  rice and gravy.....They were out of greens and mac and cheese...But what do you expect in the afternoon when everything is homemade? The pork chops were wonderful. The gravy is awesome and the place was full. Its good southern food at its best representation. I am from South Alabama so I should know...."}
{"text":"I ordered 1 entree. It was just under $20 and took over 45 minutes to get. The staff was nice, but no one could be nice enough to make up for the time and price haha"}
{"text":"We were heading into Vegas for a conference when my friend suggested we stop at EllaEm's as she claimed their fried chicken was the best ever!  She had been to EllaEm's on her last trip. So we did. There were 6 of us. We each ordered the Fried Chicken lunch plate and there honestly was enough food for 12 people. The food was amazing.  I had the fried chicke which is cooked fresh upon order, mashed potatoes and gravy and red beans and rice.  The service was great, the atmosphere hip, and everyone seemed to be happy to be there...both customers and staff.  Totally recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The portions were large.  I had the ox tail dinner and it was filling and fulfilling.   Totally satisfied with the succulent meat falling off the bone.  My wife had the catfish and it was equally delightful.  The prices were outrageously affordable.  This experience will  definitely get me back.  Our server Q took good care of us!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on a work trip. I loved the customer service. I ordered catfish, oxtails, greens, okra, black eyed peas. The food was delish! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I'm a true southern Gal so i can appreciate a gold home cooked meal that reminds me of mine or my Mom's.  The service was also pretty good the young lady had a great attitude and gave great customer service. I have No complaints I would visit again."}
{"text":"Let me first say that the customer service that we received here was top notch!  Jaz (I believe that was the lady's name) helped us and the other gentleman helping out were both amazing. They made sure that our drinks were full and checked up on us regularly.  They were also very accommodating considering that our 3 year old was knocked out and the husband had to carry her while he ate his meal.  I felt like they took an extra step to make sure we were happy and our needs were met.  Not only that, but they even gave each of us a to go cup of their lemonade, even though we only ordered one.  I thought that was pretty cool of them.

Now the only reason why I am giving them a 3 star rating is because I thought the food could have been better.  A lot of their dishes were on the salty side.  Like their collard greens, fried okra, and fried cabbage.  My mother in law thought the same thing which is unfortunate cause we were both excited to try their greens.  Not only that, but their chicken fried steak and shrimp were both hard, dry, and salty.  However, my son's grilled pork chops were pretty good.  They came out piping hot and juicy.  Oh and their muffins were delicious!  We kept asking for more muffins, they were that good.  

All in all, the experience itself was not bad.  Like I said, the customer service that we received was great, but the food could have been better."}
{"text":"A pile of well-seasoned catfish, solid greens and a mountain of mac and cheese for $7. Yeah, that'll do. Server was friendly and attentive. Not much more needs to be said -- if you're heading out Craig Road, great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first visit, fantastic service!  The food?  Eh.   

Service was good, but a little TOO on you to place your order.  I literally just walked into the door and was taking off my jacket and the young man was on me asking if I was ready to place my order.  Not my drink order, but my food order (I asked), and it was like that for the first 15-20 minutes we were there, every 3-4 minutes we were being asked to place our order.  I could understand if they were busy, but there were only 2 other people in there. My friend and I just wanted to chat for a minute before ordering, but we both felt like they were getting irritated, so we ordered.

I got the red snapper (1/2 the filet grilled, 1/2  fried), with mac n cheese and fried cabbage.  Now first, their cornbread was VERY good (maybe make them a little bigger?), loved the cornbread, they were just a little small.  Not worth the $.50 to get another one.  The fried cabbage was also VERY delicious, still had some crunch to it after being cooked and very flavorful with plenty of juice served with it.

Unfortunately, I had to send back the mac n cheese.   It looked like it was a few days old and had absolutely NO creaminess or taste to it.  It was also oily and badly separated, and stirring it didn't help.  I really hated to, but I sent it back and got the mashed potatoes with brown gravy, which were very, very good.  Potatoes were smooth, soft, hot, and well seasoned, as was the gravy.

The snapper, both grilled and fried, was WAY overcooked and very, very, very dry.  The flavors were very good, a good combo of spices, but I couldn't realky enjoy it because I had to take a bite of one of my sides along with the fish so I could swallow. There was no other other way to eat it, it was THAT dry.   I didn't send it back, though, bc I felt really bad about sending back the mac n cheese.  

I had a pleasant experience, it's a cute place where you can hold a conversation with someone without being drowned out by music.  They had GREAT music in the background, btw, classic R&B.  

But-for the pressure to order as soon as I got in, the service was wonderful...I think I ticked our server off by returning stuff, but he was still polite, and the young lady was VERY nice, I don't think the smile left her face!! LOL.  I'll give it another try and will obviously order something else.

*  Absolutely no offense is intended, but let me make some mac n cheese for the Executive Chef to taste.  Again I don't mean to offend, but more than 1 customer complained about this side and I'd love to try...."}
{"text":"A must in Vegas. Family owned and operated the cooks do change and the quality suffers on those days. At drive from Southern Highlands to eat here and you should as well."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed every thing from ambiance to service to price and most definitely the food."}
{"text":"On February 7, 2015 My business partners & I went to EllaEm's for dinner. We were told by Ms. Allyson they were closing & we'd have to place to go orders. Since we were hungry we said ok. Thankfully she had a change of heart & seated us. Between the four of us we ordered fried red snapper, oxtails, fried chicken, greens, yams, rice & gravy, potato salad, black eye peas and mac & cheese. The meal also came with corn muffins that were great for breakfast the next day :-) Everything was yummy!! We all left full, fat & satisfied. Thanks Allyson & Q for making our visit to Vegas all worth it. Great service. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"!!!Great value!!! Rarely do I go home with leftovers, this trip I did.  Super clean dining area.... Many return visits are on the horizon :  )"}
{"text":"So I've tried this place before when visiting about two years ago. The fact that I could vaguely remember my meal should have been a red flag! I LOVE well made soul food, this was lackluster at best.I'll start with the rice since it aggravated me the MOST because how do you fudge up plain white rice? It was so mushy and gummy  also the gravy needs so umph! The Oxtails were decent nice size no complaints there however I'm an oxtails rice and gravy tour of gal so the rice kind of fucked up the meal for me.  The Mac n cheese was boo boo it taste like had been sitting in a refrigerator for quite a while! Also it seems as though they use those deluxe box pasta GROSS. Please don't pass the garbage sprinkled with cheddar cheese as southern Mac! Last Item was the yams all I have is an eh for those. I'm writing this review to remind myself never to try this place again!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and had a craving for some soul food. Yelped my options and decided on this one. Best choice ever!!! Service was impeccable and everything I mean everything was just delectable. Not overly greasy or heavy but still packed with loads of flavor. This place will be an absolute go to every time I come to Vegas. Shout out to Q our server. :)"}
{"text":"Went back and had excellent service as always!!! Love love love the food here!!! Definitely try the fried catfish or the shrimp and don't forget the Yams and rice and gravy. Yaaaaaasss! I seriously eat here every week and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"OMG! I havent found this kind of \"mama's\" cookin since I left GA. Everything was PERFECT! BEST chicken fried steak ever, so crispy & juicy. Fried cat fish falls apart at 1st bite & batter stays on til last bite. Yams is like Thanksgiving heaven. Mashed potatoes are so smooth. Mac n cheese is loaded w cheese. Can't go wrong with fluffy rice & chicken gravy. LOVE LOVE LOVE it here! Very cute decor inside for sweet date night (especially rainy day) Service was friendly. Always coming back! :)"}
{"text":"We called in our order and I picked it up...it was ready in 15 min. Piping hot. 

The friendliness of the staff and how clean the place looked gave me a great feeling about their food. 

We had the fried chicken and fried catfish meals. Each had awesome flavor but were a bit on the dry side. My faith was restored however in dipping each into the heavenly mash potatoes and gravy. Omg. I woke up at 2 am craving these potatoes! Our other sides were just as tasty...fried cabbage, Mac n cheese, rice, and these beautifully sweet yams. I'd go back for the sides alone. 

The meals also came with corn bread and we ordered a German choc cake and a sweet potato pie. These were also very good. 

If you are looking for some heavy hitting southern food this is the place to go. The hot sauce was also very good and I'm glad I have extras to use here at home!!"}
{"text":"Food is very good catfish is awesome very delicious fry chicken is good I would come again and so very friendly staff"}
{"text":"My Oxtails were amazing!!!! Along with my  yams, greens, fried cabbage and cornbread!!! The service was well inviting. The ambiance was relaxing and made you feel at home!!!"}
{"text":"I finally made it here to try their Fried Chicken. I didn't feel like eating solo today so I just ordered it to go.

Fried Chicken - Dark (leg and thigh)
 includes 3 sides and cornbread
  -mac and cheese
  -mashed potatoes
  -fried cabbage

The chicken was fried perfectly. It was not greasy like the chicken you get from Popeyes. The sides were all very good. The cornbread was just ok.

There was also a sign on the register listing their lunch specials for $7 between 11am-3pm."}
{"text":"After seeing the 4 stars, my husband and I decided to try this place out. The service was horrible. The young man who helped was polite but there was a young girl working there and she needs some training. Overall the food was nothing special, I could of got the same thing or better at Popeyes. Even if the food was amazing, the service was too bad for me to go back. The girl server set a dirty plate from the table next to ours on our table because her hands were full! That should sum it up! Will not be back."}
{"text":"Authentic Soul Food. I had the fried chicken which was so crispy on the outside, very tasty and juicy on the inside. I wasn't a big fan of the dressing but the yams and sautéed cabbage were delicious. Nice desert selection but I didn't have any; I ended up taking the yams to go and had that for desert later. I will be back next time I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is so down to earth. The hospitality is felt as soon as you walk thru the doors. I haven't even eating the food yet and I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The oxtails Meat Loaf fried cabbage potato salad and rice and gravy was the star of the show absolutely delicious the macaroni and cheese needs work"}
{"text":"Okay so I usually never write bad reviews but this is strictly in reference to the \"catfish\" fillet, it is NOT catfish at all, it is Swai. I wouldn't complain but when I asked the waiter he agreed that it wasn't catfish. 

The sides I got were pretty good though; greens, candied yams, and Mac n cheese (could have been more creamy and less greasy) but all around were good. 

I highly suggest ordering something else."}
{"text":"Okay so while in Vegas a week ago, I finally got a chance to visit this place.  Honey and I loved it.  There was one young lady \"I forgot her name\" cute young girl curly hair I think it was Amesha or Anisha not sure.  She was so extremely sweet and gave great suggestions on what to try.  The prices are very reasonable and food was great, I had the Oxtails yummers, black eyed peas, potato salad and greens all was soooo delicious.  My honey had the fried chicken, double mac & cheese and mashed potatoes and gravy also very good.  The place felt like you were at home enjoying a good meal.  I will for sure be back.  The only reason it is short a star is because we took the desserts to go and when we had a chance to taste it which was peach cobbler for me I didn't like it at all and my honey got german chocolate cake and he said it was ok."}
{"text":"Omg!!! A friend and I visited this soul food spot on 12/1/12. The young lady that helped us was AWESOME!!! She took her time explaining the menu and was just the nicest young lady. The restaurant is small but cozy,great music was playing
I had the red snapper and was quite impressed!! My friend had the chitterlings dinner and she raved about how tasty they were. We found out the owner is from the Bay Area so that explained a lot since were also from those parts. All I can say is keep up the good work and if anyone is looking for a soul food spot THIS IS IT!!!!"}
{"text":"Good Home cooking flavour. The vegetables were so good I may have to get just the vegetable plate on my next visit."}
{"text":"Nice decor & ambiance for a strip-mall restaurant, very surprising and welcome.  We were there on a quiet afternoon and were amazed at how fantastic the food is and the service was just incredible.  One of the gals there saw me picking food off my husband's plate and brought me a serving of the same thing, gratis.  

My southern hubby had the catfish plate and loved it, and we both loved the fried cabbage.  Not a southerner, I tried their cheeseburger - it was okay but there's a reason why this isn't a burger joint ;)

Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I'll break down and try to deal with the southern obsession with frying everything ;)"}
{"text":"The food was really good & hot when served . Serve was also great , I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I live down the street and went here spontaneously without hearing anything about it. My first thought was wow this is pricey but then I got my food and the portions were HUGE. 
Cornbread was DELICIOUS 
Fried Chicken DELICIOUS
chicken fried steak DELICIOUS 
The only vice is really the service which isn't terrible but it's not that great either..
Perfect place to go if you want a hearty home cooked meal."}
{"text":"This place was quite the disappointment, ordered over the phone and was told that I must provide a credit card for phone orders, when I intended to pay cash upon arrival......so called back with card number, the lady made sure to ask If I'd actually had the card number, like I called back without having the proper information smdh.......tacky and a huge turn off, ordered my food was told it would be ready in 20mins........ waited for an hour, no apologies, neither was anything offered to me for my wait.......say some cobbler, something to show they were sorry about the wait.......the food was underwhelming, probably could get better soul food and service at Popeyes which is sad smdh, better yet could have cooked it at home myself.......one of my sides was wrong, fried chicken was disappointing, shrimp tasted as though it was cooked the day before.......never will order here again.......Ontop way over priced for what you get, three dinner meals came out to $51, simply a waste......will find a legit soul food restaurant to go to, or cook it myself at home.......Dont waste your time or money"}
{"text":"Some of the best food ever! The fried chicken is amazing, perfectly cooked and don't get me started on the mashed potatoes....ummm delicious! We will be back everytime we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food here is great and decently priced. I totally would recommend this establishment. The staff is awesome and so friendly makes you feel so welcomed. The environment and feel of the place is so relaxing and easy. The lights are dim and the music is playing but not so loud to where you cannot talk with each other.
I had the country fried steak that was delicious. The portions of the sides are very generous . The mashed potatoes, fries, and mac and cheese were so tasty. My group all had different items on the menu and everyone was completely satisfied with the taste of the food. Everything about my experience here was great. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"So I Gotta Say, Me n My Wife Is A Regular Here.. Love The Food n The Service, But 2nite's Service Was Terrible.. Got In About 5:30pm and Waited, n Waited To Put In Our Order, But No One Came.. Waited About 30 Min. People Came After Us, Sat Down n Was Helped n Their Order Was Taken.. Kinda Irritated, So We Left.. But Oh Well, I Hope Our Service Will Be Better The Next Time.."}
{"text":"Just a word of warning if you're planning on trying their bbq rib sandwich. It looked wonderful---big piece of meat sticking out of the bun. But beware, the ribs have the bones still in them! The ribs are very yummy but impossible to eat as a sandwich (I'm not quite sure why they serve it that way!). You have to remove the bun in order to eat it. If I had known that, I would have just ordered the bbq rib dinner and got 3 sides with it! With the \"sandwich\", you only get a choice of fries or potato salad."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and \"Jaz\" treated us like family. We already knew what we wanted to order so we placed our order. The food came out hot and delicious! Everyone at the table absolutely LOVED their food. We had the meatloaf, chicken and waffles, red snapper and a sample of the sides. It all tasted like grandma's home cooking! We will definitely be coming back.

Our sons loved the red Kool Aide, I had the sweet tea and our daughter had the lemonade. All the drinks were good. We also ordered a whole sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving. If you haven't been here you need to come. If we lived here I'd be here frequently.

Thank you Jaz for the wonderful customer service and for the love. Thank you chefs for the amazing food!"}
{"text":"I came here with my extended family while we were out in Vegas for a softball tourney. The place was quite, cute and clean. We got seated right away. 

Ordered our food. A main dish and 3 sides, I got fried pork chops, greens, mac & cheese and red beans and rice. We had 6 people all together and the food came out quick. I was quite surprised that our food was out already. Everything I had was good. All my sides were good. Oh, yeah and they give you cornbread too. The cornbread was tasty too. I can't even say which side was my favorite, but I will say that the red beans and rice and greens were pretty damn tasty. Our server was friendly and our glasses were never empty. 

One thing I will say, is that their desserts, not all since I didn't try them all, but the Red Velvet cake and Lemon cake are not the ones. I think it was a box cake with vanilla frosting, not even the cream cheese frosting for the Red Velvet. Both cakes were a lil on the dry side.
 
Overall, it was a good experience and I would so go again if I was out wandering in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok let me first start out by saying thank you Jazz for making our first time here a good one! Your smile and friendliness was exceptional. Second those cornbreads were to die for, I have had a few in my time and they have been dry but these ones were soft and moist. The fried chicken was yummy, the way they season it makes it so delicious and juicy. Make sure that when you go eat there you go hungry because it's a lot of food and you probably end up taking some left overs home, not that that's a bad idea. We will be back for those Ribs and Oxtail dishes."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. So glad we stopped in. We were looking for a great fried chicken meal and we found it. Everything is homemade and delicious. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I've only been here once. This place is small, but nice. It's clean as well as roomy. The staff is pleasant. The food was pretty good, especially the sides. I've had better oxtails, but the sides were quite delicious. Overall, I can't complain. The experience was nice. But ultimately when it comes to soul food, I prefer down south cooking, or my family's good flavorful cooking."}
{"text":"The best soul food I had in Vegas by far so if your in Vegas you might want to make the effort to get some good soul food"}
{"text":"Wonderful potato salad and catfish. Loved everything I've ever had here. The whole family loves it!"}
{"text":"Im so done with supporting this place. 

The service is completely horrible to were Im feeling damn near disrespected. The staff mess up your food/order and istead  of apologizing and trying to fix it they play and insult you. I have never experienced being blamed for the restaurant mistakes until this place. 

The food is a 50/50 toss on consistency. The Mac and cheese for a soul food restaurant is actually under sub-par. The chicken, greens, and cabbage can be different tasting from day to day. 

I have placed orders 3 times each time my order has been forgotten to be placed. Ive been told to pick up in 30 mins. I get there and Im waiting for 1 hour 30mins and longer. The funny thing is you arent offered a refund, discount, drink, or nothing. Service and accountability go a long way with me. I once only ate here for Sunday's. Well time to find new places. 

And get a bigger space your kitchen is 5 times the size of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends around 1930..

I got the baked chicken, with Mac and cheese, yams, and collard greens!

I really like that they use turkey in there greens instead of pork, because I don't eat beef or pork!

The Mac and cheese was ok, and the yams were nice and sweet!!

The baked chicken was ok (wasn't as seasoned as I thought it would be) I'm not sure if it was because we arrived kind of late, but my food was luke warm..

Everyone else, enjoyed there food! If I am back in Vegas, I'll give this place another try, maybe I'll come earlier in the evening"}
{"text":"EllaEm's was recommended to me a dear friend who comes every weekend for some grilled liver and onions, with a side of greens. 

We went on a Saturday so it was a bit busy but they managed to get us a table fast. 

The atmosphere is that of a fast food joint but more laid back. Black Art hang on the wall and family pictures. The staff is friendly. 

We had the chicken and the smothered pork chops. The portions are big and come with sides, like mashed potatoes and greens, plus a corn bread."}
{"text":"Great food...We had an older lady as our server she was scattered not organized at all and we chose a suitable table she instructed us to sit where she wanted us too...Again great food...Service eh.... Martha Carter of Fontana Ca."}
{"text":"Came to visit Vegas and wanted some soul food. Looked this place up and said let's try it eventhough it was a lillte out the way.....GLAD we did! We was promptly seated and ask if we wanted something to drink right away.... Funny cause 3 mins later another waitress asked did we want something to drink....They both were right on it!!!! Very nice and friendly! They keep checking on us.....after we ordered we received our food about 15-20 mins after.....food was fresh, tasty, and finger licking good!!!! It was southern good cooking! Food was excellent!  Glad we made the decision to go! Must try in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Having a taste for my 2nd most favorite dessert I head over to Ella's for some peach cobbler. Upon entering I noticed the place was filled to the rim with people so I thought this should be good. After standing at the counter for what seemed like forever and listening to the chaos was not good, even noticed the lady at the counter ignore a phone call saying she was too busy to answer it, anyway I asked for a lg peach cobbler and was told I don't think we have any so now I'm annoyed but luckily another lady knew where it was and so she hands me 3 regular size containers which I guess equals 1 large.

I get home and dig in and I go wtf. Half of it was hard and the other half was doughy as if they took 2 screwed up pans and made 1 big screwed up pan. Since I didn't try any regular food I won't say I wouldn't try again but definitely will NEVER get peach cobbler again and hopefully if I ever visit again it won't be so crowded as it seems like they don't have the staff to handle large crowds"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 STARS because of the professional friendly service. As far as the food is concern that I had ordered, the meat loaf was ok, but the mac & cheese needed the local pastor to come and lay hands on it for resurrection purposes...Shalom from the Bahamas"}
{"text":"I got the smothered chicken with double mac and cheese and rice with some gravy. This is truly the meal that warms my heart. If you're looking for a great portion of food for a reasonable price. This is definitely the place for you."}
{"text":"No! The prices are too high for the food to taste like it did. It's not my cup of tea. They may need better cooks in the kitchen. My only used season salt and pepper for her food and it was fantastic. I think I tasted garlic in my gravy and I was not a happy camper. I gave the rest of my food to the dog and eventually to the trash. Everyone was rude except for a guy named Marquis I think... won't be back!"}
{"text":"Soul food should always come in portions this generous! $16 seems like a bit much to spend on a smothered porkchop plate, but then you discover the plate includes three chops and three generous side portions- more than enough to share! Chops themselves come with your choice of chicken or beef gravy, but the overall flavors were just okay. After craving this dish for a week and driving half an hour, it just didn't quite hit the spot, unfortunately.

Sides selected were mac, greens, and cabbage- I'm not even a fan of cabbage but their version was flipping delicious with bits of ham and good crunch without too much oil. 
Too bad the other sides were so dismal- mac was a generous portion but super dry and the cheese was in large clumps as if my little sister were making it, while the greens were virtually flavorless aside from the heavy-handed dose of salt.
Cornbread was decent, kept in a warmer that perhaps over-steamed it, as they had a mushy texture that I did not care for.

I was hoping to find an alternative to M&M, but unfortunately this place was more miss than hit for me."}
{"text":"I went to EllaEm's today. I ordered the lunch portion of the baked chicken with mac n cheese and yams. First, the chicken was under cooked. Second, the yams were 99% sugar. They were so sweet to the point I couldn't enjoy them. I love yams so you can image how disappointed I was. 
People cautioned me not to go there but I believe in trying things for yourself. With that said, I will not be back to EllaEm's."}
{"text":"Soon as my family and I walked in we felt at home. Excellent customer service. I will definitely make this a \"go to\" place when I come and visit LV.  Food was excellent!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"FOOD- awesome awesome awesome!!!! ive only had the OX Tail and the waffles/chicken and it was absolutely delicious.

SERVICE- AWESOME. The people are friendly, they ask how everything is doing, and they are very respectful. 

Atmosphere- Great. 

Price- The OX tail is pricey, but well worth it. 

Very well could be the best Soul Food in las vegas... as it was rewarded for 2 years. I dont like N. Las Vegas to begin with but i'm glad we at least have this on our side of town."}
{"text":"Sundays are packed as the local community has started coming in.  I found the portions to be pretty good myself (especially for the three sides); but in a buffet town I could see where some people may find them small.

You can get many of the dishes fried or grilled (I've had the catfish fried and the red snapper grilled -- both good.)  I have to agree with Mrs. P though, the liver and onions (with gravy of course) were really good.

Great find in North Las Vegas!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"On the positive side. the original proprietor and I share the same birthday. The staff was pleasant. 

I wanted this place to be good, I really did. It was ok. Not good, not bad. The greens were bland. The barbecue was nothing write home about and lacked meat on the bones. The cornbread was dry. The catfish wasn't flavorful. The food, overall was greasy in a bad way.

I did enjoy the black-eyed peas.

I'm sorry, just had much better."}
{"text":"Came on Father's Day to check out the menu items as I was looking for some soul food. I had the catfish, Mac cheese, greens, and mashed potatoes. The catfish was great, the mashed potatoes were delicious. I had the chicken gravy on my mashed potatoes. The Mac cheese was very disappointing as were the greens. The greens had too much of the stems left on them and the Mac cheese was dry and no cheese flavor. The server was really nice but unfortunately the service was extremely slow. They should also greet guest when they come in as we were unsure if we should stand in line and place the order for here or if we should sit and wait for the server. The servers kept passing us by while we sat so my daughter stood in line and then asked if we had to give the order and then sit down. Other guest were confused as well. I will still come again but may just have my order to go."}
{"text":"Love!! Love! Love! the food here. We are from Memphis and this place reminds us of home! The fried chicken and catfish are our go-tos! ANY side you order will not disappoint! The yams melt in your mouth! The greens are seasoned to perfection! The Mac and cheese is yummy!! We really need to try some other things on the menu, but we just love these so much! 
The service is also great! We are huge fans of EllaEms!!"}
{"text":"I had the oxtails (which were excellent) and mac & cheese,  potato salad,  & black eye peas as sides.  Lysa ordered the fried chicken with greens, mac & cheese,  and steamed vegetables as sides.   The food was very well prepared and quite tasty.   No doubt we will be making regular visits here.  The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because of the less than stellar service that we got from the young man.  First of all, he didn't know the menu.   He tried hard enough but needs help.  We ordered the German chocolate cake for dessert and he said that we had to pay for it before he will serve it.  WHAT?!
In spite of that,  don't be surprised if you see us there.   Over and over again."}
{"text":"Ok - second time and I am NOT impressed. Food was mediocre - preheating up cornbread, peach cobbler not cool- nor is telling people that some of the desserts are homemade- but I see the cheesecake factory box. I'm sure what some of the other yelper's  stated are valid and true facts as well. Out of two wait staff -only one is friendly- which is not good- nor is messing up my  order twice. Would I come back here-Nope"}
{"text":"Soooooo Good!!!! 

I had the catfish, greens, yams, mac n' cheese and corn bread. First of all the food was very hot when served. I love that! I hate getting a cold plate of food. The catfish was cooked so Right, not all greasy but fried perfectly. The greens and yams for SOOOOO delicious. The corn was the perfect amount of sweet, just Delicious and they serve it with room temp butter, not cold butter. Cold butter with bread doesn't make sense to me. The mac n cheese was just okay to me but only because I've had some phenomenal mac n cheese homemade. It was clean, the staff was courteous and helpful. 

If you are in Vegas take the detour off the strip and hit this place up. They were named the best soul food restaurant in the Las Vegas area but I've been to several places in L.A. and they have been the best so far. 

YUMMMMMYYY!"}
{"text":"Ellaem's is outstanding and has geniue Southern Soul Food.  I had the fried chicken with the white meal smoothered in chicken gravy and it was fantastic!  The fried chicken was lightly battered, very moist and tender.  I had the fried cabbage, potato salad and the rice and beans as my sides and the portions were very generous and delicious.  

The staff is very helpful and friendly.  Kim was one of our servers and she is outstanding with a very cheerful personality.

I would highly recommend Ellaem's and we are certainly going to be go back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Blown away. Hidden away in a shopping complex,but the best fried chicken & macaroni. Fresh food,  fast friendly service, and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered pork chops over rice with collards, sweet potatoes. I thought the meal was just average. No wow factor at all. Not particularly savory or even well seasoned. A bit disappointed. I probably will not return."}
{"text":"There aren't very many places to get soul food in Vegas, so this was a pleasant surprise. It appears to be a family run restaurant and there's not too many staff members here. There was one waitress/hostess here when I came for lunch, so the service was a little slow but expected. 

I got the $7 lunch special that comes with an entree choice, two sides, and cornbread. I had the fried chicken, which was decent but not great. I had a drumstick that was cooked to perfection, but a breast piece that was overly salty. Not sure why that was. I also got a chance to try the catfish that my coworker ordered and I would get that if I were to come back. Perfectly crisp and flavorful.

Among the sides I tried, the cabbage and yams were good, while the mac and cheese and collared green were just alright.

The cornbread was very moist with good texture as well.

If there were a 0.5 star rating, I would probably give EllaEm's a 3.5 overall. There are hits or misses on the menu. Also, some extra staff members to help with the service would be beneficial."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal, simple menu, great service, great portions and the food was great. Just didn't care for the shrimp. We came during regular hours and for each person the food was about $15 for 3 sides and a entre. I had the catfish, yams, Mac N cheese, and fried okra very good but also had their peach cobbler and that failed miserably. The breading didn't taste good at all, the texture was gross and bland."}
{"text":"Fried Pork Chop lunch was fanstastic as usual!  Enjoyed it with Black-Eyed Peas, Greens and Cornbread of course.  We love everything on the menu to include Snapper, Catfish, Fried Chicken, Yams, Mac & Cheese... Peach Cobbler!  Service is always great whether it's me and the gang from the office at lunch or our family for dinner.  Fortunately, we live close but I would drive cross town for EllaEm's!"}
{"text":"The best soul food I have had in a LONG time. I have lived in the South and was raised Southern..This reminds me of my Grandma's good for the soul cooking with a modern day twist. This will be my spot everytime I visit Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"My second time visiting this place and again, a great experience. Very nice small place located in a strip mall in North Las Vegas. Somewhat unassuming and far from a 'hole in the wall'. 

I stopped in for lunch with a couple of coworkers who told me to yelp us a place. The service was awesome just like it was last time. The food is made to order so it comes out absolutely piping hot. With that said, you will wait a few extra minutes for the freshness. 

The service was great. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. We went in after the lunch hours so it was not very busy. They have about a dozen different lunch specials right at $10 or so. 

I went with the fried chicken and it was very good. If I'm being completely honest, not the best fried chicken I've ever tasted but it was still very very good. And it being so fresh is a definite added bonus. The candied yams are phenomenal. The yams are few in number so I was glad it had 2 sides. I also got the collard greens and they were very tasty.

They give you a complimentary piece of cornbread as an appetizer and it's super tasty as well. 

If you haven't been- go here. It's voted the best soul food in the valley and you'll see why."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food here. My shrimp fried fresh and hot and the grease was clean. Their cabbage is very tasty and I would definitely order it again. The yams were yummy, and the homemade lemonade was good really sweet though, but extra ice will make it perfect. My group really enjoyed the fried chicken also. Also, the waitress there name Anisha is a great waitress and definitely worthy of a big tip."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Soul food restaurant in Vegas. I've had a number of items on the menu and they have all been very flavorful and tasty."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while so today while in the area the Mrs. and I went in.  First thing I noticed was the aroma of the place.  It wasn't pleasant.  The whole time I was there I was thinking that we shouldn't gotten our food to go.  However, that being said, it was the only downfall to this establishment.  But a SERIOUS downfall.  

Service was hands down good.  The waitress was very friendly and checked up on us plenty but not too much.

We both ordered Fried Chicken white meat and it was tender and juicy.  Side dishes that I tried are: collard greens- fantastic.  red beans and rice- another great side.  fried okra- Good batter but after the small bowl of them i was oiled out. 

I tried the mash potatoes and chicken gravy the Mrs. had and it was really good.  So was her potato salad and mac & cheese.  

We will order here again but it will be TO GO due to the smell of the place.  That is the only reason I took one star off."}
{"text":"A really nice soul food place. A lot of other soul food restaurants in Las Vegas have very cramped dining rooms (Gritz, Seven Seas) but this place is very spacious, clean and the walls are covered with art, family photos and posters of Black heroes like Martin Luther King Jr and President Obama.

I want to give this place three stars. The food was pre-made and reheated in a microwave, but it was still good. Still, it's always disappointing to have your plate of soulfood goodness put down in front of you and your mac and cheese is still holding the same shape as the container it was stored in.

I'm giving them four stars because of the ambiance and their stellar service. Our waiter appeared to be working the place by himself but he was attentive, very polite and knowledgeable about the menu. He offered a discount if we gave a great Yelp review, so think of that when you look at other reviews.

One dining partner ordered the veggie plate, which is basically cornbread and your choice of three sides. One of her three sides chosen was fried cabbage and our waiter stated it's made with turkey bacon (there is a sign up that says their food is made w/turkey instead of pork when possible). She was disappointed but I think its great that they're at least trying to cut back on sodium and fat by using healthier alternatives.

2nd dining partner had the meatloaf which included two sides. 3rd dining partner had  the oxtails smothered in gravy that were so delicious he threatened violence if we dared to touch his plate when he went outside to take a phone call.

I had the spicy chicken sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. I always order mac and cheese at any soul food place I go to; it's not a real soul food restaurant unless you have bomb-ass mac and cheese. EllaEm's was good, but nothing I'd go out of my way to eat again. Since it was reheated, it wasn't melty and gooey, but it wasn't bad either. The chicken was spicy, crunchy and a nice piece of meat, but the only thing on my bread was tomato and lettuce. No sauce, no nothing, not even mayo. I hope I'm not the only one who thinks that's odd.

I'm not itching to go back, but this place is definitely worth a second try."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat! Our waitress was the BEST! I love the Soul in this Soul food restaurant!"}
{"text":"This little gem is about 20 minutes from the strip and well worth the trip.  Great customer service and the food was delicious.  Everything came out piping hot and tasted great!  I had the chicken and waffles, some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"EllaEm's is a great to eat!!! The people are very nice and helpful. The food is wonderful!!!! I will definitely eat there again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Introduced to this place on Monday this week, been here everyday since for lunch.  Best Catfish and Meatloaf ive ever had.  After having a meal here my belly feels so warm and satisfied.. Makes a crappy day amazing!! Will be back here very often."}
{"text":"The food is so good! Everything I had I enjoyed! Just like the menu says, \"Food that makes you feel good to your Soul!\". I will definitely go back at least twice a month. Tonite I had the Catfish, Mac & Cheese that tastes like my grandmothers homemade, Collard Greens, Fried Cabbage and Corn Bread. Next time I'll most likely get the Oxtails. I tried my mother-in-laws and they were so good as well! Definitely the Best Soul Food I've had in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oh, this place feels like my grannies house on a Sunday afternoon. Everything is made with such care and it's literally the most authentic soul food/southern cooking in Vegas. So glad I found them, they taste like home."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. The food was pretty good but a word to the wise--don't come here if you're in any sort of hurry. It took us over 45 minutes to get our food AFTER we ordered. 


We showed up a few minutes after they opened at 11:00am. The service was a little bit slow. It that's ok--my friend and I hadn't seen each other for a few weeks so we were busy catching up. We both decided on their lunch special--you get your main dish and then two sides. My friend had the fried catfish with mac and cheese and potato salad. Lemme tell you--that potato salad may be the best one I've ever had!  I chose the meatloaf with mac and cheese and fried cabbage.  With the meatloaf you have the choice of having it with gravy or a tomato sauce. Per the servers recommendation, I had mine with the tomato sauce. It wasn't bad...but I think I would have liked the gravy better. The mac and cheese...I had such high hopes for it and it definitely fell short. There wasn't much taste it at all.  The fried cabbage was dang tasty though--probably my favorite part of the meal. 

All in all, it wasn't a bad experience.  I'd go back again but it's not a place I'm going to be like \"omg...we have to go here again, again and again\"."}
{"text":"Stopped in for carry out. 
Food:   Delicious 
Service:    Awesome 
Price:   Very Reasonable

WILL BE BACK !!

I loved the mashed potatoes !!"}
{"text":"This was our second time here. Food was delicious as usual. I had the snapper with potato salad, greens and red beans. My husband had the chittlerlings with yams, greens and macaroni.  Jazz was our server, she's amazing. She made our experience even better. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Out of everything we had the only things we enjoyed we're the catfish and corn bread. Everything else was not satisfying."}
{"text":"Ok. I see you. This place exceeded expectations. Service was right on point. They give u cornbread biscuits soon as u sit down. Good coffee. Catfish n yams n mashed potatoes was fire (awesome). I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying soul food & it was better than expected! Definitely a place I'd go back to! Although one of the servers was a bit rude when we asked for refills or for service in general"}
{"text":"Here again! The food, the food, the food was so good. My mamma's house would take second place, if I they didn't have such good service with a smile, which doesn't happen at my momma house. I enjoy the catfish with yams, collard greens, and rice as the lunch special. I got it quick and before I expected. Enjoy that place while in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Had the Groupon.. yay! Very glad, because I had never heard of this place. 

So many people claim that they're cooking up soul food, however this place actually nails it. I felt as though I was eating at my aunt's house.

I order catfish with potato salad and I also had peach cobbler. Catfish was great. Potato salad was amazing! Uncommon for me to say this, because I have yet to taste decent store bought/restaurant potato salad.

I will say stay away from the cobbler. Awful! 

The inside is really clean and fun. Great for kids. Amazing staff!"}
{"text":"When we want some down home cooked southern meals....this is the only spot we go to.  I hghly recommend the oxtails and mac and chhese!!!"}
{"text":"The 3 pieces of filet catfish were not worth 9.16. Seasoning alright. The mini cornbread muffin was good and moist.  Dimly lit. The cashier was nice and friendly(which deserved and got a tip). The tables were customers are eating are to close to the counter/cashierits amazing how prices have gone up and the portion size have been drastically reduced.  Tried this due to hype."}
{"text":"Delicious food and service. Our waiter was attentive and helpful. The food was well-prepared, fresh and delicious. The menu offers quite the variety, so it was difficult to choose an entrée.  We all selected something different and tried one another's food. It was all tasty! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"It's always best to call in your order because it takes can take a while. But it is always worth the wait. 

This is my go to when I dont feel like cooking but I want my family to have a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Soul food at its best!! My cousin told us to come here. It was perfect for our last day in Vegas! Our server amanda was the best nice and friendly. I had the red snapper,fried okra,and mac and cheese! Everything was seasoned well. Omg the collord greens were ro die for!! Cant wait to go back to Vegas just to come here and eat!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime I step foot in Vegas I always come here they have the best Soul Food!!!! So don't waste your time at other soul food places there garbage I Was there Thursday & Friday and had the fried Red Snapper with Collard Greens, Black eye peas, Macaroni Cheese, and  the bomb corn bread Everything was excellent!!!!!* The only thing the ##GRAVY## was way to ##SALTY## so somebody in the kitchen is to heavy handed with the salt back there!!!! Other than that well done  Very clean and waitress nice, friendly and  professional...."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a chill atmosphere. The staff is super nice too! If you decide to come make sure you get the fried catfish! Comes with 3 sides too! Collard greens and the candied yams are THE BOMB! :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! So yummy. For southern fried food this is the place. 
If you're in the mood for collard greens, fried okra, fried chicken, meatloaf or cornbread this is the place"}
{"text":"Food= absolutely delicious. 
Fried catfish was so yummy. 
Home made mashed potatoes were out of this world w/ chicken gravy was an added bonus. Yams were cooked perfectly yummy 
I was happy to find out the black eyed peas were amazing. One of the reasons I came in the first place  
Customer service= ehh. My gf asked for gravy on her pork chops and no gravy on her mashed potatoes. Her plate came out with neither then she re brought out the plate and there was gravy on both lol I had to ask her to bring out the black eyed peas because apparently she had forgotten."}
{"text":"Thanks Loretta for the great service. Had the smothered chicken fried cabbage collard greens yams, food was great will be back."}
{"text":"I came here a few times a month a year ago when I lived on this side of town. It was so good! I would always get fried chicken, rice n gravy, and mashed potatoes. I came back a few months ago I went and the food wasn't the same. Not sure if they changed recipes or the cooks weren't trained properly, but I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and i are regulars, and eat there every Friday Night. The food is out of this world tasty, and for those who don't turn their noses up, the liver and onions are superb. No, they don't cook it like shoe leather. The collard greens are beautifully sesoned, not overcooked. The fried chicken is divine, and the black eyed peas are seasoned so well. If you want great southern food, EllaEm's can't be beat!"}
{"text":"IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CATFISH! 
Atmosphere: small, cozy, fun music and conversation just fill this space with a jovial feeling. 

Service: cheerful, friendly, and attentive. Forgot my salad until I was already eating my meal. Really should have comped it at that point. I didn't eat it. 

Food: FRIED CATFISH! This is what I came for and I was not disappointed. Perhaps the BEST catfish I've ever eaten. I will crave this regularly. The mashed potatoes were just alright, I didn't even eat them. The mac n cheese was very good. I'll be having that again. The salad was forgotten and by the time it arrived I wasn't in the mood but they used what tasted like bottled hidden valley ranch and I really prefer the freshly made stuff. The sweet tea wasn't sweet enough. I know! I was shocked too. 

Price: a little high. I wish I could just buy the catfish and none of the sides. But I'll pay it to get that catfish so. ..."}
{"text":"Best corn bread in town! You only get a small serving though. I always want so much more. I've had the fried catfish and the meatloaf here. Personally, I thought the meatloaf was better, but the catfish was pretty good. The sides are also very tasty. I would highly recommend the black-eyed peas and the baked beans."}
{"text":"If you want soul food in Vegas this is the place to go. I usually get the fried catfish but everything is good. The ribs fall right off the bone. It's always a challenge picking out sides. The mac n cheese, fried okra, mashed potatoes and greens are all fantastic. The only thing I can say negatively is that sometimes it gets hot in the restaurant but it's worth it despite the heat."}
{"text":"It's something in the food and the environment that gives it all the soul. Jaz is the truth. A great waitress with a great personality and beautiful welcoming smile. Plus I appreciate that they all remember you. Starts feeling like you pulling up to yo mama house to get a plate. And did I tell you the food is off the chain. #loyalcustomer"}
{"text":"The cornbread...OMG..it tastes like cake.  The service was excellent, the food was awesomely good. I had oxtails, Mac n cheese, yams, and rice no gravy.  I haven't had a good soul food meal like that since I last cooked...lol...I very rarely cook.  Try it and I'm certain you will enjoy it like I did."}
{"text":"The ambiance is cute, and a little small if you choose to dine in. I've ordered from here twice and I'd have to say the food is mediocre. Definitely not what you could get home cooked, but it satisfies. It's hard to find authentic souls food that makes you want to slap your momma! If you are craving soul food, then this would be its \"fast-food\" equivalent. It's all cooked fresh, you can see the cooks through the little window to the back, but the taste is pretty generic."}
{"text":"My husband and I were meeting family here. We are from out of town and they live there,but have never been there. Ok, that is the set up. I ordered the snapper dinner and my family ordered the steak dinner and the fried chicken dinner. The group was not new to soul food so we asked some ??'s.1st, don't order sweet tea! Each dinner comes with 3 sides. I noticed one family member did not eat the fried okra or the mixed veggies. the other family member skarfed her fried chicken. My snapper was fresh! and large! Three pieces was one larger fillet!
The place was clean. We did not have  to walk thru the kitchen to get to the bathrooms. The house was clean and nice.  Thank you Ellaem's! We enjoyed our time with you."}
{"text":"I guess the thing that messes things up for ElllaEm's is that I grew up on soul food in L.A. and it's simply better than any I've had in LV....M & Ms, Roscoe's Chicken N Waffles, Aunt Kizzy's Back Porch, Harold & Belles...you hear me knockin'?

Went with the chicken  and waffles and they were ok.  The chicken needs more seasoning and there needs to be a few more pieces on the plate. The waffle needs to be pumped up some because they are a bit on the thin side and not too flavorful. I would recommend there be a host/ hostess  posted  at the entrance because when you walk in you don't know what to do. Do I wait  for a server or do I just pick my own seat?  Service needs to be faster as well, we waited far too long  for the amount of food we ordered. 

Now, me and my out of town guests  were dead set on trying the peach cobbler but they said they ran out. I love cobbler so I tried again on Sunday and they ran out again. Still have not tried the cobbler.

I think EllaEm's excels at their sides. The yams are some of the best anywhere. The collard greens are excellent and the fried cabbage is pure perfection. However,  the mac n cheese was just ok. 

Prices are reasonable  and parking is really good. There are several other good eateries within this shopping center as well. For first timers I recommend ordering the pork chops, collard greens, yams and the cobbler......if you can find it."}
{"text":"Yum yum YUM!!!!! My top soul food restaurant by far!  It's hard to find good catfish in Vegas, but theirs is always fresh tasting, cooked perfectly, and just down right delicious! 

I will admit that's sometimes the sides aren't consistent, but I've had more good days than bad. 

Mac n cheese, yams, greens, and red beans n rice are my top picks! 

Definitely worth a visit!!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good and the waitress was really nice to us. She brought my toddler some extra corn bread because that's the only thing he would eat lol! I ordered the fried pork chops (pretty good), collard greens (delish), fried cabbage (blah), and mac & cheese (amazing). My husband had fried chicken and waffles and he loved it. The portions were huge. My only complaint was the restaurant wasn't very nice and the bathrooms needed TLC. I think we will order take out from now on but it was very good soul food."}
{"text":"5 stars! I love EllaEm's soul food! I have been here multiple times because of their chicken and waffles. The chicken and waffles portion is pretty big. It comes with a big waffle and 3 chicken wiings/leg. It can feed the both of us. Sometimes we will just add a few sides and an extra waffle to make us extra full. I admire how they keep their food nice and fresh. Everything that we have tried is always so delicious. Their mac and cheese isn't too salty and has the right amount of seasoning and cheese. Their mash potatoes with brown gravy is delicious too. It always tastes fresh like they just whipped some up just for you and your plate of food. Their potato salad is yummy! It has that little bit of sweetness and tartness from the mustard, I would love to take some on a picnic. Ha! Their cornbread always comes out warm with a bunch of butter. My fiance loves their cornbread, I don't blame him. It has the crunchy outer texture and the inside is soft and warm. Yummm. Just thinking about their food is making my mouth water! I believe everything they make, they make with love which is why I gave them 5 stars. Prices are worth it too. 

I love the inside of the restaurant too. They kept it nice and simple and kind of true to the type of food they make. Nothing is too fancy, you can comfortably eat and feel cozy. The walls have posters and they have pictures of their family members and I love it. The servers also remember who you are if you eat there twice within a week. Haha. I don't regret it. I absolutely love EllaEm's!  Oh! They also do trays of food which is nice... So maybe one Thanksgiving I won't make any food, but I'll order all my food from here!"}
{"text":"I would have really, really LOVED to give EllaEm's five stars. Here's why I can't.
We went last night for my grandmother's 79th birthday. I called ahead to let them know that a party of 8 would arrive at 6pm because I'd done some recon and saw it was a small place.
We arrived on time, we're seated and greeted on entry. Our waitress took our drink orders and returned promptly.
Here's when it goes south.
It took 53 MINUTES from the time we ordered for any food to come out. Then they served 4 of our party.
The rest of us had to wait another 28 MINUTES for our orders. By the time they brought our food, everyone else (who were starving after waiting almost an hour to eat) were almost done. 
I knew based on the reviews that this place was a diceroll. Unfortunately on such an important occasion I crapped out. I was mad because I was the one that suggested this place.
The food was AIIGHT but not bomb. The best thing about my meal (I ordered fried chicken, greens, and potato salad) was the potato salad. 
Disappointed in so many ways because I live right around the corner and this could've been my family's soul food spot, but we will not be coming back, ever."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and even better food! Cornbread was sweet and warm.   Catfish was lightly breaded and delicious. Sides (greens & Mac) were also very good. So glad that I stumbled across this gem! I understand why they have multiple best of Las Vegas awards!!"}
{"text":"Was in Las Vegas for a short while and never had soul food or could find any good while there. Until my friend who lives here suggested this place. And to my surprise I loved it the delicious fried chicken, greens, mac and cheese almost as good as my home cooking :o) And lets not forget the red velvet cake was delicious as well. If you haven't tried this little treasure of a place I highly suggest it, I'll try it again when I'm in a couple of months to make sure it wasn't just a fluke. And also to try something different on the menu, oh and to the person who felt they were forced to order a burger please the pleasure of going out to eat is getting what you want. Never let a cook or anyone persuade you other wise. Because after all you're paying the bill, so you could have easily left if they weren't fufilling your request for what you wanted. I patronize businesses that are there to please the customer, if that's not the purpose then why are they in business. Give them another try, and next time order what you want because I will. A satisfied customer, see you next time Vegas :o)"}
{"text":"Very, VERY disappointed! This is my third/fourth time here and this has been the worst of all time. I called in my order because I don't like to wait. I was told it would be ready in 30 minutes. I left my house exactly 30 minutes after placing the order. The place is only about 5 minutes from my house so you would think once I arrive the food would be ready right? Ummmm no!! The person I normally deal with is not there. There is a guy that looks like they hired him directly off the street working at the register. I paid for my food and was told that one of the meals was just getting prepared, smh. I run next door to grab some items and come back and my food has been given to someone else. I am LIVID! The food is great but the customer service SUCKS! I'm just leaving after being there since 8pm! RIDICULOUS!! Until they get better customer service stay far away from this establishment!!! What restaurant do you know that doesn't have a manager on site? They have to call him on the phone and he sounds like he is 6th grade educated!!! I'm sooooo done right now!!"}
{"text":"First time here. I had the oxtails. Food was good. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. No complaints. Definitely will be back to try the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"ate there 4 days ago. best soul food in las vegas.the oxtails were the best we ever had.the sides were unbelieveable! fried okra,red beans and rice,yams,black eyed peas and rice and gravy the best ever.when you sit down to order they bring you warm cornbread best we ever had.my wife not a fan of but she loved this."}
{"text":"Had the Fried Catfish, (very good), Mashed Potatoes with brown gravy,(good) collared greens,(not good) my co-worker got the grilled Red Snapper,(very good) mac and cheese(not good) and collared greens( she liked). I thought the service was good, portion size good and the restaurant was clean and well decorated."}
{"text":"Came in from The Bay Area and heard this is The Best Soul Food in Las Vegas I was not disappointed, everything was Really good, love that they use Turkey instead of Pork in their greens and the cabbage. The muffins were so yummy , ate more than I intended."}
{"text":"First time going in and it definitely won't be my last. Beautiful ambience with neo soul music and r&b. Perfect chill music to enjoy dinner. Reminiscent of grandmas house. Being from Florida, I have been waiting for a genuine soul food restaurant and this is it. Dressing not stuffing, yams not sweet potato, baked macaroni and cheese not Mac and cheese. Great food. Cabbage was a little salty but other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"Food was awesome as usual!!! Could not finish it, but took it to my hotel.  It was so good had it the next day.  I think this a great place to get a home cooked meal when you are traveling."}
{"text":"I ate here 3 times. All times the food was good but extremely greasy. We tried the Ox tails, catfish and pork chops. The sides were extremely good greens, red beans and rice. Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"My first time in Las Vegas and I couldn't have had a better experience! What makes an awesome adventure is the food you eat on the way and Ella Em's Soulfood is the #1 place to go to if you want amazing food without the Las Vegas crowd. I got the yams with fried chicken and collard greens which was out of this world! Jazzland, our waitress, had so much patience with everyone and has such a great personality which made it that much better. Timothy, our other waiter, made sure we had everything we needed while cleaning and tending to other tables with Jazzland. Their work ethic is very impressive and the food is to die for. Definitely coming back whenever I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"I love finding little hidden family owned restaurants because you know they put their heart and soul onto every place... and they definitely heavily ladled on the soul!
Now down to the food:
-catfish filets: They were flaky and moist with the right amount of breading and crispiness on the outside. Not too oily, but still sinfully good
-The country fried steak was just downright comfort on a plate. Very rich- I would recommend getting the chicken gravy over the brown gravy. I think the chicken gravy just goes better. 
-Yams- amazing!! I would highly recommend this side. It's sweet almost like a sweet potato pie filling. I liked it because it almost served as a palate cleanser at the end of my meal & as dessert too! 
I will definitely be back to try the other dishes that caught my eye: oxtail, fried chicken, more catfish mmm they will need a wheel barrel to roll me away"}
{"text":"Ok, first I must say I was a bit turned off by the girls working behind the counter. They had a tendency to play with their hair and not once thought about washing or sanitizing their hands. I brought it to their attention. They weren't happy with me but oh well. 
Then a change of Shift and the scenario was completely different. 
First let me say Thank You Ramon. You made our stay fabulous. When Ramon was working he sanitized the silverware. Whenever he worked with someone's food he always had gloves on and was extremely pleasant. Whenever he handled money he always sanitized afterwards. I am impressed. 
The restaurant is extremely clean, a good find no doubt. 
The food brought back memories I cherish if being back in Greensboro North Carolina at my Aunt Sadie's home at dinner time. 
Everything that came to us was flavorful and absolutely delicious. Catfish and fried chicken, crispy and not greasy, an awesome cook. Cabbage cooked with bacon wow, red beans and rice right out of the south. 
Out of all the things that make me mad is the fact that I haven't found it before today. 
Be Warned I will be back."}
{"text":"When you think of Soul Food, Catfish comes to mind. No, not the stupid reality show on tv but the real actual fish. Here they do have it with your choice of it fried or grilled. They also have Chicken n Waffles. I took my 12 year old son with me to check this place out. We did ended up getting the Catfish and the Chicken n Waffles.

The Chicken n Waffles were pretty good. You get 3 nice sized chicken wings, a waffle, and eggs any style you want. The chicken was crispy and slight breading to it. The waffle was just ok. I was expecting to be at least a little more crispy than it appeared. The eggs we got scrambled. Nothing special to note there.

The Grilled Cajun Catfish was good as well. Came with your choice of 3 sides. I picked Mashed Potatoes with Beef Gravy, Mac n Cheese, and Mixed Veggies. This is where I got really disappointed. The Catfish was decent but all the sides tasted a bit bland and was lukewarm. The veggies were definitely not fresh because it was partially soggy, it looked lifeless, and was chewy when I took a bite. The Mac n Cheese tasted like what I make my kids at home with the instant microwave stuff. It's not fancy but it is good enough for them. Here at a restaurant that is unacceptable. Last but not least, the Mashed Potatoes were a bit dry. Maybe they didn't put enough water or milk in the mix before putting it in the microwave?

As for service, they are a bit slow here. We came in at 6:45 pm on a Tuesday night. There were only two other tables occupied at the time. We got our food I would say about 15 minutes later. After about 5 minutes both our drinks were empty. Another 5 minutes later I had to ask for a refill on both our drinks. Rule of thumb, if you have to ask for refills after so much time has passed, that is not good service. 

In closing, I would stick to ordering the Chicken n Waffles and Catfish. Stay away from the sides, well at least what I ordered. To be fair I cant assume everything was nuked. I also would like to try other items so I can give them the benefit of the doubt especially if it warrants updating this review. Until then, its 2 stars for me."}
{"text":"The food looked much better online than it did in my togo box. At first glance I thought the Mac and  Cheese was gonna be nasty, but it wasn't as bad as it looked, but not what I expected from a soul food spot. I ordered the catfish lunch special. The fish was really good. The cornbread muffin was really good. I was not impressed with the yams either. I ordered over the phone and had to give my card info before they would start the food...... Anyways I think this place is over priced, but there were a lot of people in the restaurant. I'll give it another try before I am completely done."}
{"text":"Now this place here is the best Soul Food place in the State of Nevada. When family and friends come to town this is where I go."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! I am from NC so soul food is in my blood (and on my hips!). You get a ton of food, no way anyone can handle an entree and the 3 sides in one sitting. The ox tails were tender and seasoned well; yams were excellent, collard greens were amazing; and the mac and cheese was tasty, although the cheese/eggs were a little curdled. We will definitely visit there a lot to get our soul food fix!"}
{"text":"Oxtail is bomb!!!! I love this place so much. I come here whenever I want oxtail.... I like the atmosphere too. Seriously some really good soul food!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best soul food joint I've had yet. There are still a couple I haven't tried in Vegas. So as of now this place takes the lead!

They are voted \"Best soul food restaurant in Las Vegas\" and they do live up to that reputation. When you first walk in, it's kind of small but had a homey comfy feel. The ladies there were very warm and welcoming. Advising us we can take a seat where ever we feel comfortable. Service was excellent. Someone came and got our drinks and order real quick.

I ordered the smothered chicken, white meat. It comes with 3 sides & also cornbread. I got -- mashed potatoes, greens, & Mac n cheese. And oh my goodness. The mashed potatoes were one of the best I ever had. Idk what they put in it but it was so creamy and the gravy accented the mashed potatoes just right. The greens were pretty alright, nothing special about them though. Mac n cheese was da bomb! It had just the right amount of cheesiness. Now let me tell you about the chicken! The chicken was perfection. Even tho it was fried, it wasn't dry, it was so moist! I do recommend getting the white meat instead of dark because it does make a difference on the taste. 

The beau got the chicken and waffles. It doesn't come with sides but it does come with 3 chicken wings, eggs (your choice of how it's cooked) & comes with corn bread as well. The portions are large so he could barely finish his 3rd chicken. He loved and thought the chicken was delicious as well. 

I'm impressed with this restaurant & will probably return when I need a little Soul in me. Lol"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on Valentine's Day for breakfast. Since we were the only one's there it was really intimate. We ordered the Chicken n Waffle breakfast, VERY GOOD. We will go back again but it will be for dinner. :)"}
{"text":"I called around 1 to place an order. The first person that answered asked me to hold, and then I suddenly heard a dial tone after being on hold for 2 mins. I called back only to find they ran out of ox tails already... they open at 11 and are running out of food at 1? Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Ate there four times in two weeks. I had Red Snapper, greens, potato salad and mac n cheese twice. I also had fried chicken two sides of greens and red beans and rice. Oxtails and gotta say I love the cornbread! So good!!! 

Service was cool, our waitress was very personable and funny, The chef over heard me talking about the food, came out introduced himself and we cracked a few jokes. It truly was good home cooking. Food came out fast and steaming hot just like I it!"}
{"text":"The music is good, the food is better, but the sweet tea made me really sad. We were looking forward to freshly brewed sweet tea when we saw a soul food restaurant on Yelp.... but they use that pre-made bag tea called Peak & it's awful! 

The meatloaf, mac, & catfish are amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, home cooked , and right on the money every time . My husband and I go here often . The staff is wonderful they are very efficient, though it may be a bit of a wait when they're busy , it is so worth it !"}
{"text":"It gets no better. If your looking for spectacular soul food, EllaEm's is the spot. If you're in the Las Vegas area, make time to stop by this place. EVERYTHING on the menu is amazing. I can't speak highly enough of this place."}
{"text":"Nice decor, very friendly staff. Service was quite good even with 70% or so occupancy. Catfish with greens and black eyed pease were right on point. I will go back."}
{"text":"First off, I am one picky SOB and do not take my soul food lightly. I was skeptical of Ella Ems like I am of all restaurants.  Since this was my first visit I asked the woman behind the counter what she recommended. I went with her recommendation and ordered the ox tails with collard greens, red beans and rice wth gravy.  I ordered my food to go because I left my boxer out of his crate and don't know if he will destroy anything.

Let me tell you every dish was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Beans, greens, oxtails and rice. The gravy was also delicious. The only thing I did not care for was the cornbread muffin. It is too sweet for my liking, it is closer to cornbread cake. If the cornbread was more savory I would have given 5 stars. 

The staff yet needs to be evaluated from a dine in standpoint and I will do that on my next visit. Yes I will be back. This establishment is definitely worth visiting. What are you waiting for, go!

And now, the idis....."}
{"text":"This place has only been open for about two weeks.  I had the liver and onions with yams, green beans, and peach cobbler.  You will leave full, but you will not have enough for a doggie bag because the portions are smaller than normal.  I think it is because they are new.  On another note, you get three sides and a small piece of cornbread with your entree.  I was shocked that we got three sides.  My guess is that once EllaEm's turn a profit, the portions will increase which is understandable.  I must say that my liver and onions were the best I've ever eaten.  Everything was d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s!  The service was outstanding as well.  I can see that they are really focusing on customer service.  In contrast to ALL of the other local soul food joints in Vegas, they have the cleanest/nicest dining room.  This place will get my business and my support because they are trying to do it right."}
{"text":"First off, I loved the whole atmosphere of this place! It's a real small, family owned spot that's kind of tucked away in a shopping center and easy to miss. This may just be me but the interior has a 50's diner kinda feel with the red & chrome which I thought was cool. They also keep their restaurant really clean and that's a huge plus.

We ended up going fry crazy haha. I went with the catfish and my wife picked the fried chicken, and let me tell you...they know how to fry food at this place! Both the chicken and fish were fried completely even to a perfect gold brown. The catfish was unbelievable! It's cooked just right with that \"oh, so good\" tender flakiness and their seasoning is dead on. Not too heavy with a little kick and just enough flavor to compliment the fish. The chicken was pretty dang good too but it had a slight flour taste which could probably even out with a little more salt. They aren't skimpy with portions either...alongside the fish or chicken, you get 3 sides and cornbread. Their mac n cheese is just ok but they have really good greens, red beans and the cornbread was definitely up in the top compared to most places in town.

Easily one of the top spots to go to if you're looking for good fried food! They have amazing food with a good selection and with the portions you get, the price is hard to beat. We went in at about 8pm on Friday and they were getting slammed with customers so I really think they could benefit from staying open a little later. It felt like we were being slightly rushed which is why I'd give them 4 stars but I'll definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and the food was on point. I had the Mac n cheese, fried cabbage and red snapper fish, it was seasoned perfectly, you get a good amount of food for a very reasonable price. I definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Food that makes you Happy!!! Me and My Husband went here for lunch. We ordered the Oxtails, Fried Okra, Potato Salad,And Cabbage. Everything was Delicious!!! Excellent Customer Service. I will Definitely be Back! Can't wait to try the Pork Chops!"}
{"text":"Tradition. That is what this cute soul food cafe is steeped in. The menu is a tribute to a lovely NOLA influenced granny, RIP, who lived to the ripe old age of 97 1/2 and who apparently was a gifted cook.  These are her recipes. Consider yourself honored to meet her through her granddaughter's perseverence to share her food.

Located on the north end of town, near Nellis AFB, this is a very attractive, clean, spacious eating establishment that should be taken seriously by locals and travellers as well. It is desireable not only for the food but for its location far from the craziness that is downtown and on the Strip. This is in the land of copius parking and chill attitude.

The Catfish has a lovely cornmeal crunch, not at all greasy. It comes with great tasting tartar sauce and your choice of 3 sides.  The servings were so big I felt I was looking at them thru a magnifying glass.

The braised oxtail came with 3 pcs as big as a fist and a choice of two sides. The meat was fall off the bone tender, and the pan gravy was plate lickable.

Even the cornbread muffin was unique with an interesting crusty muffin top. Served with REAL butter.

My mac n cheese side (oh my goodness wonderful) was made exactly as I crave, with lots of the right kind of cheddar cheese.

The collard greens were tender and hammy and tangy. Oh so good.

Then there was the fried cabbage with bacon.  I could eat that all day long.

And yep, Mr B indulged in tasty Black Eyed Peas.

I didn't, but if you want to see what all the hype is over chitterlings, you don't have to go down South. They have them here.

They offer excellent service and a delightfully cheerful vibe.

You have no idea what authentic soul food is about until you come here.  I have tried many places, but this ranks #1 for me.  I would definitely go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Once I moved in with my mom. I started eating at this place very frequently, I have tried their fried catfish, baked chicken with light/dark gravy, I love their collard greens, mac & cheese, yams (taste like candy) potato salad, red beans & rice, French fries. My mom loves their fried porkchops and okra! She's from down south so it's very hard to find fried okra! I LOVE their corn bread muffins, they always hook me with extra when I ask! My daughter loves their catfish, she won't eat anything else besides the corn bread. If my 3-year-old likes it, WE LOVE IT! Ladies are always sweet to me when I dine-in or pick up my food."}
{"text":"i would like to give a big shout to ellaem's!!!
the food was delicious, the portion size was just right & so was the price. my server tim was great!!!!! best soul food i had so far in vegas....."}
{"text":"Service: I think the service went from good, to great after we got to chatting for a few. The guy who took our order seemed maybe busy at first while taking our order. When he asked me certain questions I wanted his opinion as to what was better in his opinion. Later he came and joked with me and had a nice smile on his face. 

Food: wow! I loved the food from here and so did the rest of the family. From our main dish all the way down to all the different sides they were all delicious! Not 1 bland item on the plate! I will 100% be going back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars! Oh my if you're looking for great fresh and hot Down home SoulFood 
look no farther you have came to the right place. This past Sunday, Oct. 6 2013 my mother and I came in here from church I order the catfish dinner with my choice of three sides: rice with beef gravy, collard greens and yams. Everything was dellicous the only downside if you can even call it that is the small potion of cornbread.  Maybe their trying to help us save on calories? lol I  could tell by looking at it that it was going to be awesome which it was. Next time I'll  order more cornbread I was in a bit of a hurry due to having goceries in the car."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a few days....my boyfriend had been telling me about this establishment and it did not disappoint!!  Excellent food, friendly service and a bomb music playlist during the lunch hour.  We WILL return!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We were recommended this spot by a friend so we gave it a shot after a long day of apartment hunting. We walked in and immediately got a good vibe from this place. Good music playing, food smelled delicious, & we were the only other couple in the restaurant waiting for our food. Unfortunately we waited 1 hour 20 mins until we called it quits! Yes, over a hour! We were too busy looking at the houses &a apartments we saved on our phone to even notice we were waiting that long. The restaurant then had a little crowd and people started getting their food before us. And trust, we played out every explanation...there was no excuse for that terrible service. Things happen, I know...but at LEAST come to our table and let us know what the hold up is. So disappointed. I lowkey think they had a problem with us but I'm not going to get into that! Idk maybe they didn't, but you see, their service was so bad it's got me making up reasons in my head lol I mean there is no other explanation for their trash service. We walked out. I've been working on my temper too so I didn't make a scene. I told my friend about their trash service and he then replied \" oh yeah, they are hella slow man. I forgot to tell you that.\" Lol Order ahead if you dare to go to this place. We'll find another soul food spot though. MF got me hot!!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food & service.  We had the chicken & waffles, catfish, and country steak.  No complaints here. My kids loved the mac n cheese.  Love the cornbread too.  We'll be back again."}
{"text":"I forgot to add what happened when I stopped by to discuss my rotten food. 
The young lady that spoke to me was kind. She offered to give me a replacement chicken breast on the spot. I stated, \"so you're expecting me to order more food to go with the chicken breast? It's 10:00am.\" She said ok. Well that's the best I can do. She smiled and I left. 
I have not returned."}
{"text":"We were driving through Vegas on the was to Phoenix and found Ella's. Great food and service! Even though I didn't order any they had chitlins on the menu!!!!!! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Ok. So I've tried this pace twice now... and several months apart between visits and it's pretty good... the prices are kinda steep... and for ox tail on the east coast you get WAY MORE for what they charge here .. but overall the food is decent... not by any means the best but far from the worst. . Location is not to bad either ... dining area is kinda small but inviting in a homely kinda way.... both times I encountered friendly counter staff ... that were patient thru my indecisiveness. .which is why the extra star on food and price alone I'd give a 3 but customer service goes a long way..."}
{"text":"We went to Ella Em's on a Friday afternoon and had lunch. Loved everything! We had the special $8.00 dollar lunch. I had fried chicken with two sides and a corn bread. The wait staff were all friendly and attentive every though it was a little crowded."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite soul food in all of Las Vegas. Divine. Grateful for the legacy left behind."}
{"text":"Ox tails, mac&cheese, fried cabbage, potato salad & to top it off GRANNY'S GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!! YUMMY YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!!! :) not to forget bout the awesome service & the cleanliness of the restaurant, but the food really is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"one of the best catfish i've had.  i've tried so many and this one had so much flavor and yumminess.  will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We had a late lunch here a few weeks ago and it blew us away! So good. Friendly staff and great food. Much better than M&M Soul Food. Better prices and better tasting food.

I don't need to have the staff at a soul food restaurant serve me wearing tuxedo shirts and bowties like they do at M&M. 

We will return often to EllaEm's!"}
{"text":"Just left this place. Other people arrived after us started receiving their food before us. 40 minutes later a waitress comes to our table asking us how are we going to pay because there credit card machine is down. How convenient? She lets us know there's an ATM across the street. I didn't see her ask other customers. At this point we still haven't received our food. We left so if yall are reading this those 2 water downed drinks are on you. We were in Vegas on vacation and trying to support a black owned business. Just going to eat at a restaurant on the strip since they appreciate OUR money."}
{"text":"I wish I listened to Nelson Q's review. Spot on!!! 
I was extremely disappointed with the food here. While it wasn't necessarily terrible, it was not good. And what's worse, it was WAY overpriced! $16 for a few pieces of catfish (eh), lame ass Mac n cheese, watery potato salad. The corn bread muffin was dis-gus-ting!!!! However, the fried okra was pretty damn good. I liked that best. 
The catfish had nice enough flavor but wasn't crispy and delicious like I was expecting. The Mac and cheese was worse than a box. I mean horrible. So much so, they should stop making it. ($7 for a large side......whaaaaaaaat!!!!!!)
I didn't care for the potato salad. Had huge chunks of egg whites in it. Ew. Me no likey. 
And, it was watery. How the hell is potato salad watery?? The corn bread muffin was embarrassing. How can you mess that up? This place is closer to 1 star, but the okra was pretty tasty. Beware if you come here. Keep your expectations low and you might enjoy."}
{"text":"Everything's we ordered was amazing.. from the chicken and waffles to the oxtails, greens, and potato salad, to the country fried steak, yams, and dressing. We danced to the old school music and received EXCELLENT service"}
{"text":"Although it is small and you will probably have a wait when you visit, it is well worth it! The food is amazing and wonderfully seasoned but even more importantly the service was superb which is VERY important in my eyes ! Great job!!!!"}
{"text":"My trip to Ella Em's was delightful. Not to mention, I brought with me a friend from the South. She enjoyed herself too!

I got the fried shrimp and she got the baked chicken. Not too greasy and the chicken slipped right off the bone.. It was amazing! 

My sides were fried okra, steamed veggies and rice and gravy. All of them were delicious. The steamed veggies were a treat because they tasted fresh and not mushy in any way.

We got a to go box and they got us water to go which was so sweet of them because it's over 113 degrees outside. They even left a sweet note on my bill. Definitely look forward to coming back here!"}
{"text":"The food was horrible!!! Macaroni was mushy, black eye peas were bland and the greens were cold!!! The potato salad wasn't even good. I give this place 4 thumbs down!!!"}
{"text":"Food was so delicious. Service was awesome! Cornbread moist. Meatloaf was perfect and friend chicken was so good."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my daughter, the food and service was great! Very clean, has a nice southern atmosphere,  we were greeted as soon as we stepped in, enjoyed the music. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is a beautiful touch of soul,the food is very flavorful I  love the chops this place is not expensive at all you get a good bang for your buck. However the reason I  give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is I've missed out getting food because they don't answer the phone sometimes."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great customer service. I got the catfish lunch special with 2 sides. My mother got the red snapper lunch special. We had Timothy as a waiter and he was great!! Will definitely  come back soon."}
{"text":"Are there any decent Soul Food restaurants in Vegas??? I've slowly lost any remaining hope after stopping in at EllaEm's. SOUL is something that our food most definitely was missing that evening

When we arrived, the restaurant was very clean and looked more inviting than other soul food spots we've dined at(Kathy's, M&M)even the items on the menu looked very appetizing....Looks were definitely deceiving here because after our waitress assured us that everything was delicious, wifey asked \"are your ribs juicy and fall-off-the-bone?\"
\"Oh yeah\" she replied with a smile...about 10 seconds later, wifey sees liver and onions on the menu and she excitedly orders that instead.
\"Oh, you know what? that's the only item we don't have\" waitress says....
Gee, thanks for the \"heads up\" on what you're out of.

So she orders the Ribs with 3 sides-mashed potatoes, yams, and mac and cheese and I go with one of their house specialities, Chicken and Waffles. While waiting for our order, we hear BEEP, BEEP, BEEP at least 4-5 times...yes,  that dreadful sound of the microwave was a definite\"Oh hell's no!\" moment....The cornbread comes out first, but not in huge squares as pictured in the menu, but more like 3-inch circles, 1/2 inch high....WTH? 4 and 5 star reviews????Really????

Some dude named Pedro was the only cook in the kitchen and I know for a fact, he didn't even take the time nor the patience to turn out tasty Soul Food....makes you wonder how much truth there is to the EllaEm's story and its two patriarchs, Ella Rea Gray, and Aem Upachak(photo of story included)

All of the sides and the waffles were definitely nuked,which made the waffles tough and spongy and the ribs were tough, dried out and not juicy at all. We won't be  coming back here...ever. Serving food like that is totally doing the two matriarchs a great injustice...ALOHA!!!


YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(25/365) \"No soul at all\""}
{"text":"Southern food is an art. I use the term southern, whereas EllaEm's and many of the cafes of this type in town use Soul Food. I believe they are synonymous as both southern and soul food share almost all aspects. They most unifying similarity is they are both born out of poverty, and this is what makes southern/soul food an art. It is easy to make a fantastic meal when you have the finest cuts of meat and important spices with which to flavor the food. However, when you have to create magic from the poorest cuts of meat, vegetables that are easy to grow and considered common, and your spice palate consist of little more than salt, pepper and broth that is the example of a true artist. It is easy to paint when you have all the paints and a fine canvas, but to create something out of nothing with almost nothing shows real talent. 

EllaEm's is artistry on display. It is fine southern food with flavor to spare. This is not a diet conscious restaurant where calories can be counted. It is instead a representation of a culture where food is used as an offering of love, and often the best of times happen around a dinner table. There is little pomp, and no circumstances here, just good food at a reasonable price...well mostly reasonable. 

On my first visit I had the fried chicken (dark meat), fried cabbage, red beans and rice, mashed potatoes and gravy, and two corn muffins (my heart will never forgive me). The chicken was excellent, very moist and fresh with a good crispy crust. My one of only two complaints from the evening was there were only two pieces of dark meat chicken. The sides made it more than enough for a fulfilling meal, but one more piece of chicken would have made me feel better about the order. The red beans and rice were good, but not great. The mashed potatoes with chicken gravy were to die for. I must return to have the chicken and waffles with chicken gravy (for which my heart will once again curse me). I had the fried cabbage at the suggestion of my friendly and courteous, albeit somewhat slow, server (second small complaint) . The cabbage was perhaps the best part of the meal, and would win hands down if not for the corn muffin. Go ahead and order two at the start because one is just not going to cut it. 

I would like to give EllaEm's 4.5 stars because of the two small discrepancies I mentioned above. I rounded up instead of down because ElleEm's is exactly the type of business I, and I hope you, like to support. It is local owned, not in a fancy location, and providing a good service at a reasonable price. I big you if you are wanting a good meal with a distinct American cultural edge, chose ElleEm's over any one of the worthless and \"soulless\" chain restaurants which litter our city. It adds wonderfully to the burgeoning community Vegas has so long needed."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need some soul food in your life. We came here pretty much at closing and there was no problems.. no \"the kitchen is closed we are sorry\" we were greeted very nicely..thank goodness! because I really wanted soul food that night. The food was good, but the service was amazing!!! Jaz (I think was her name) was very good. So overall I think I would come back here when I am in town. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm rarely in the area and was joined by fellow Yelper Andy T.  to check the place out. Can't recall what else I had aside from the chitlins but I know, we've had better. Nothing really remarkable. I've been to M&M in Los Angeles and Kathy's (prior to their move) to name a few which were much better experiences for Soul Food in my opinion."}
{"text":"Some of the best soul food I've ever had. I ordered the lunch special for 9.99 and got 3 filets of catfish and two sides. I had to take a Box full of food home. Very quick service and food was great. Would highly recommend this to anyone if your looking for home Cooked food."}
{"text":"The Best Soul Food I have ever tasted!!!! Ohhh and them large meaty oxtails with gravy is fire!!!!
Definetly one of my favorite spots!! Must try!! They over pack your plate!"}
{"text":"A - Service
A - Food
A - Time
A - Price (Better with Groupon)

Best experience.  Writing this from table."}
{"text":"They say best of Las Vegas more like the worst. 

First the largest pictures are on the wall are very political. 

They don't brew their own their own tea. 

They don't give you real butter with the corn bread you only option is warm margarine. 

The Red Snapper isn't Red Snapper it is a Taiwan \"farm fish\" that isn't close. 

The chicken came out raw and when it was sent back was burnt neither time was it Good to eat. 

Then the meatloaf was very dry and over cooked. 

The only good thing here was ice water. 

Much better places that have soul food in Vegas. M&M, Lola's, Southern Eatery just to name a few."}
{"text":"Great southern Ms style soul food. Huge portions. You may wanna consider sharing. Love the smothered chicken."}
{"text":"I have eaten at EllaEm's a few times.  So far my experience has been a very good one.  The fried catfish, fried chicken wings, yams and collard greens are delicious!  I normally go during the day.  The staff is also very pleasant and accommodating every time I go."}
{"text":"First off, I lived in the South nearly all of my life and grew up in Kentucky. I lived in Mississippi and I spent many weekends in New Orleans so I know what \"Soul Food\" is supposed to taste like. Anyhoot...The first time we patronized this establishment our food was less than we expected both in quality and was overpriced. So, we tried this place again thinking that our first visit was just a mediocre semi bad day. Unfortunately...the food was not palatable. The chicken was not completely done and you can take my word based on personal experience that if you eat chicken that is not completely baked or boiled or whatever you will get sick. Also...my cobbler was average at best and between 2 of us we still left half the desert uneaten. Oh well. At best this place is hit or miss and not much to write home about."}
{"text":"Delicious! Started off with a sweet tea, then I ordered the liver and onions, and my friend ordered the fried chicken and gravy. My sides were black eyed peas, fried cabbage, and collard greens. The liver and onions was smothered in gravy, and very tasty. Not too salty, and not bland. There was a lot of food for a great price- I ended up taking most of my sides home, which were very good warmed up the next day."}
{"text":"The food is a little pricy but it really is good. Cornbread was great, greens on point, catfish is fried perfectly. It wasn't mushy, soggy, overcooked, or bland. The fish was crispy on the outside and flaky within and well seasoned. I wasn't a fan of the pork chops but seeing as to how good everything else was, maybe it just was an off day. Maybe it's just my preference. Soul food is always a hard thing to do perfectly for others because you grow up with certain recipes or cooking it the way you love it. What I will say is...check your preference at the door and enjoy the food because it really is delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome food, amazing atmosphere and wonderful service. Tasha was great! I had fried chicken, red beans/rice, and mac n cheese! Delish"}
{"text":"Still my favorite soul food spot in Vegas! Every time family comes to visit we always take them to EllaEm's..... We haven't gotten a bad review yet. The service the food is awesome."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice in the past week with my family. Food is great and service is wonderful."}
{"text":"The food was good but not what I expected. The serving sizes are great, one entree will feed two. I'd revisit, just not as often as I initially thought I would."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had a heavy craving for soul food and decided to try something closer to home rather than our usual spot. 

We got there around 1:00pm give or take 5 minutes. We waited about 15 minutes since tables had to be cleaned. Which was no big deal, Sunday lunch rush I'm assuming. We got to choose where to sit which was great. 

I loved the wall decore. It was very family-oriented and had an old school vibe with good culture behind each picture. But it got old after about an hour of staring, waiting for our food. 

I ordered waffle and wings, the fiancé ordered the fried smothered chicken, with chicken gravey, potatoes, and mac.

So an hour in for my chicken and wings and his smothered chicken. Started to get a little sour when other tables were getting their food at a faster rate, but I don't know their orders or wait time. There was a large party of 10 in also, which likely had an impact as well. So that's fine, as long as the food is good. Ya know, worth the wait. 

Unfortunately it was dry. The waffle was amazing though! But the chicken was lackluster and appeared to be overcooked in the fryer. This occurred on both our plates. Although crispy and seasoned well, it needed a lot of gravy and syrup. The egg on the side was overdone also. I ordered sunny side, got something that was viaually akin to over easy, and ended up with no yolk.

The gravy was great and the sweet tea was good. My fiancé enjoyed the mac. The corn bread was the absolute BEST part of our meal. Soft, moist, flavorful; everything it should be. 

Another plus is that the waitress was wonderful. I have a feeling she felt bad for the wait since she kept refilling our drinks to the 9s and did her best to make sure we were taken care of. Good service on her end! 

Overall, not impressed by the food, upset that I waited for an hour and fifteen, and hoping to one day give this place another chance if possible, if only for the for  bread.

I would have loved to try the sweet potato pie, and my fiancé would have ordered another mac, but we didn't want to sit for another half hour of our only day off."}
{"text":"If you want quality, great tasting food without busting your wallet while enjoying a great atmosphere this is the place to go. The ambience of this restaurant is wonderful. The first time I went there it felt like a family dinner after church. Normally they play classic And modern RnB music.The Catfish, and fried chicken are my favorite foods. This store gives a true taste of southern style food. I have brought many family and friends who visit from the east coast and they all are very pleased with the meal. The customer service is also great and I have never had any issues with this restaurant. They have many other great tasting food on there menus like oxtail, cornbread, and collard greens to name a few. Also there entrees come with three sides unlike most other restaurants that only come with two. The restaurant is a great way to spend a family dinner or a simple date."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Amazing food. Friendly service. Definitely a place we will go again!!!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of home what a great bunch of people and amazing food"}
{"text":"Decent food.  

To go orders are routinely incorrect and usually overcooked and inedible.  Advice: Check food before you leave.

Far too expensive for the food offerings and service.  Lemonade in a plastic cup $4.50?

Occasional, rude servers.  Act like they are doing you a favor to serve you there.

Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Yum! Far far surpasses any bbq restaurant in las vegas! A must try and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We went here for one of my son's birthday. It was a nice small spot. I really liked the pictures they had on the walls.  When we walked in nobody really greeted us even though one of the waitress was literally two feet away from us. We seated ourselves?. We all order sweet tea to drink. It was water down. I ordered the smothered chicken with beef gravy with rice and gravy, collard greens and yams. My son ordered chicken fried steak with french fries, potato salad, macaroni and cheese. The birthday boy ordered fried chicken salad sandwich and french fries. My food came and it was baked chicken with my sides. It wasn't smothered in any type of sauce. I asked if i can have a side of gravy for my chicken. I wasn't impressed with my food. My son said his chicken sandwich was pretty good. My other son's food was tough meat with beef bland gravy on top. He didn't like his sides at all."}
{"text":"This place is tha TRUTH for soul food!!  Well seasoned, large portions, friendly service. We had the smothered ox tails, black eyed peas, Mac n cheese and collard greens: FABULOUS!!
Coming back soon to try the smothered liver and onions!!  
YES I LIKE LIVER!!"}
{"text":"They were not having a good day, the evening that l had dinner!! That's usually my biggest problem with Soul food spots, you eat one day and have a very good dinner and then you go back an everything seems like it falls off a cliff.. these places an be very inconsistent!!!! Eat at ur own risk"}
{"text":"Everytime i go i get top service with a beautiful smile from jaz, makes me feel like im home and family. She takes care of every customer with a smile and very quick"}
{"text":"Had a rare date night with the wife thanks to my mother-in-law watching the kids so we decided to check this place out. We passed by so many times and wanted to go but never got around to it until now. The service was great, we didn't wait too long for the food, and the food was AMAZING! Every item both me and my wife had was delicious. We were not disappointed at all. We plan on returning for sure and bringing some friends and family with us next time."}
{"text":"We was in town, and my friends wanted soul food, this place was on point, just as they were closing they welcome us in, and they serve us good hot fresh food, this will 1 of our spots to eat every time we come in town. Thanks for the good service and good food."}
{"text":"The food and service is completely awesome.. This place has the best soul food in Las Vegas. I'm talking about monster plates of collard greens, mac n cheese, porkchops and chicken. Their cornbread is sweet and very delicious. I'm looking forward of paying this place another visit. They will always let you walk out with your tummies hanging out of your shirts."}
{"text":"I grew up in the south. I know good food for my taste. Ellaems is fantastic. Allyson is a great server!"}
{"text":"The food is good but not the best I've had, however I am from the South. The service was good, and fairly quick considering it's a small establishment with quite a few patrons. 
I had smothered chicken which was quite tender and juicy, with yams and okra. The yams I wasn't particularly fond of, but they were well prepared. My child had the chicken and waffles and he was a fan, I tried the waffle and it was good, light fluffy and just sweet enough. 
Overall I was satisfied and I'll go back."}
{"text":"This is my first time here & I will definitely be back! The food is sooo good, just like my big mama's!  The veggies are great & the oxtails are falling off the bone! The restaurant is nice & clean! Friendly service!!"}
{"text":"They were sooooooooooo close to a 5. Dammit I wanted them to be a 5, since the last soul food joint here was a total disappointment. UGH!!!! 

Anywho, my food was GOOD!!! I initially was going to take out, then decided to dine in. I came in for lunch and they were busy. They only have about 8 four seat tables, but they utilize them all. I can see this place having a serious crowd on wknds and especially after church on Sundays. Their call-ins were jumping too. I wanted fish & chicken so the waitress suggested to do the fish lunch for $10.99, it comes w/2 sides and add the 2 fried thighs I wanted. Which is what I did. 

A cornbread muffin came out 1st w/butter. Then my lunch came 10mins later. PIPING HOT!!!! I ate the fish 1st. TO DIE FOR!!! This was some seriously tasty fresh catfish filets. No swai crap served here! Greens weren't out of a can, I did add hot sauce they were a little bland. Then I tasted my chicken, it was good, but not fried hard enough because the meat was still a little rubbery, but had it not been for that they'd have gotten 5*s. Chicken was fresh & hot, good seasoning no salt needed, just wasnt fried long enough. Finally I tasted my yams. Yummy!!! Just the right sweetness to them. This was a solid lunch for 10.99, even though I added on the chicken being greedy! 

Let's talk about the service. This 1 young lady ran the joint almost alone. She never folded under the pressure either. Phones jumping, waiting area filled. She served us hunni! I can appreciate her. She did it all with a pleasant tone and a smile. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I said I was going to give EllaEm's 4 stars, but looking back, I don't know what they could have done better.
I went here with the work gang for a semi-going away lunch before my maternity leave. Everybody recommended the fried catfish, and although I am not usually a huge fan of catfish (what's with that gritty-like texture), I caved to peer pressure and decided to try it. Great choice! The fish itself was light and flaky and the batter was delicious and a little spicy. So good. Also, the lunch special came with 3 (3!) fillets, so that was more than enough. The lunch special ($8 I think) also comes with 2 sides, of which I chose yams (delicious and sweet, just like I like), and mac & cheese (good, typical soul-food stuff). Others at the table ordered the greens, the fried cabbage, and the mixed veggies, and the only complaint I heard was about the mixed veggies. Oh and they also brought out delicious homemade corn muffins before the meal!
The service was friendly and prompt and the iced teas (sweet & unsweet) were all delicious, too!
Overall, this place was so good that I might consider venturing up to north town just to bring my husband here!

Note to management: can you please heat up your butter or serve it in a bowl soft or something? Trying to spread those hard packets on our corn muffins almost ruined them!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Didn't even make it a week without coming all the way back here for the fried chicken dinner. Ok. Left my bank card here and they were awesome and held onto it. Double win on my part. The food is amazing and the people here are the absolute best!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Service is questionable depending on who's working and the drink system is quite weird. You would expect while dining in you can refill your own drink since the machine sits out near the tables. However you have to wait on your server to do it for you if they see you. While ordering we were offered kool aide (which I don't mind if I have a taste for it) or \"homemade lemonade\" so I opted for the lemonade since it was in the container and I was told it was homemade. THAT LEMONADE WAS NOT HOMEMADE! That was country time powder. It was too yellow! And she had an attitude when I asked if we could switch our drink. So I said forget it and switched with my boyfriend who kindly took my drink to diffuse the situation. On their menu it says it is and they have nerve to want over $3 a glass. In total for drinks was $7 on our bill. If I go back I'll be ordering for pick up or bring my own lemonade no lie! And hopefully I don't get the grouchy older lady as my server. She looks like she was having a bad day and overwhelmed."}
{"text":"04/15/2018 -- OMG!!!! I ordered for the first time via Doordash and I'm full and happy from the delicious oxtails and veges! I wished I could've had Ting soda but will buy it to accompany my food with dreams of Jamaica!! Thank you! Cheryl Ellis"}
{"text":"Not sure how they earned \"Best Of Las Vegas\". 

Service was A1 and very genuine as hosts. This is the only positive. 

The food on the other hand was very poor as far as quality of ingredients and you could tell the chef was amateur by the way the food tasted. Overall the food was weak! Wasn't satisfied at all. Pretty much myself and two others that I was with were very disappointed. This food def wasn't cooked with love. 

I never wanted to write this review but I had to share that Thoughts and say \" How can you screw up smothered chicken?\" 

They just need a better cook and someone to monitor the quality standard of the dishes before they are served."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  The prices are great for the amount of food that you get.  My favorite item is their oven baked ribs!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelper's for making my Las Vegas stay a memorable work stay. My choice was easy, smothered chicken/dark meat and fried to boot with collard greens, Mac n cheese and mash potatoes....oh the mash! Truly comfort food in the desert! 
I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"Had the meat loaf dinner with red sauce, mashed potatoes, black eyed peas, and mac n cheese...i have no complaints at all and I look forward to trying a few more dishes."}
{"text":"Now I'm not a Chitterlings type of girl... However, I have to say the chitterlings here not bad. It's better than other places I've tried. The texture is like chewing thin sliced beef. Not gummy or chewy. For all you chitterlings lovers out there...not bad, not bad!"}
{"text":"I gotta preface this review by saying, I'm not the biggest fan of soul food. My friends and I were in Vegas for the weekend and decided to try something new and off the beaten path of the strip or downtown. Ran a yelp search and found EllaEm's. Being just shy of 10 off the strip wasn't too bad. 

I'm sooooo glad we rolled through! Got there about 2pm on a Sunday, the place was pretty busy. We grabbed a seat and quickly greeted by our waiter Q. He got our drink order and gave us sometime to look over the menu. 

I was torn by a few different items... Oxtail? Meatloaf? Fried Chicken? Fried Catfish?  Aaaaaah! I don't know! Q rolls back to take our order, my friends were ready... Fried Catfish & Fried Snapper with collard greens, mac&cheese and red beads&rice. I asked for a recommendation and Q was on point... Meatloaf with a red sauce is his favorite and Thad good enough for me! I got the mac&cheese, fried cabbage and the red beans&price!

All three of us loved our meals. The Fish was flavorful and flakey... The Meatloaf was tender, juicy and so tasty! The red sauce was peppery and the tomatoes were sweet! Great flavor with the beef! All the sides were amazing, but the Red Beans&Rice straight stole the show! We were thanking God we each ordered our own! There was no sharing at this table!

All I gotta say... I'll be back... Actually, we'll all be back! And I'll definitely open up to more soul food spots in L.A. Thank you EllaEm's and the staff!"}
{"text":"We wanted our soul food fix so this was where we stopped (after Mario's didn't have fish steaks).  You can see right into their kitchen and I saw a Hispanic making the food so l was skeptical of what the food would taste like.  I was quickly disappointed as I found out their sweet tea wasn't home made.  I mean how can you have a \"soul food\" establishment without home brewed sweet ice tea???  Moving on, I got the ox tails with the sides of collard greens, Mac & cheese, rice w/gravy and corn bread muffin.  The ox tail and rice w/gravy was my favorite part of the meal.  The tender meat was falling off the bone with soft rice covered with homemade gravy (9.5/10).  The collards greens were ok.  I personally like my greens cooked a little longer (8/10).  I wasn't a big fan of their mac & cheese but then I'm picky about my mac & cheese.  I'm sure someone likes it that way (7/10). The cornbread tasted more like a cupcake than it did cornbread.  I think they used more flour than cornmeal in their mix.  My friend loved it since he likes cakes (7/10).  Would I come back?  Yes."}
{"text":"The food was great and so was the service. Go during lunch to take advantage of their $9.99 specials: shrimp, fried and baked chicken, fried snapper, etc. 
Military discount."}
{"text":"came in for the first time and had their baked chicken, greens and rice n gravy. the portions were plentiful."}
{"text":"Cozy diner style restaurant. Excellent service.  Delicious food.  Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating here. The service was fast, very nice staff. I had the meatloaf, rice and gravy, and Mac and cheese. The food was really good, large portions, but I have to say after eating some by chest began to beat really fast. I truly believe it was in the seasoning of the meat or gravy. The portions were huge so I had some for dinner. Needless to say again after eating more of the food; I experienced the same feelings. I would return to the restaurant, but I would not order the meatloaf. In essence, I loved the meatloaf and gravy, but it didn't love me back. I am simply sharing my experience.."}
{"text":"We loved this place it was delicious  and the customer service was just amazing. We have gone back the the food and service is the same."}
{"text":"been going here since they opened a good number of years ago , very good soul food , they have weathered some bad years , however went back to basics , good service , the best gravy I've ever had , oxtails, chitterlings,ribs and chicken are money makers , delivery service should expand their revenue , customer base is diverse and loyal -"}
{"text":"This is seriously my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. A must when you're in North town!"}
{"text":"My friends recommend this place for lunch and I was a little nervous cause I rarely eat soul food.  when entered the restaurant i immediately got a good vibe from the place.  I ordered the Ox Tail, it was $15 but it was well worth it. The meat fell off the bone and the 3 sides were on point (red beans and rice, potato salad, and macaroni.)   I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband brought me in for lunch today. Highly recommend. Huge portions and very fresh. The girl that took care of us was polite and made sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The smothered chicken, red snapper, greens and corn bread are delicious.  Actually everything I've had has been terrific.   Friendly service too.  If you like soul food this is THE place to go!"}
{"text":"being married to a Southern boy, and living in the South for so long this place makes soul food  like home again I have the pork chops with collards black eyed peas and mashed taters.Great atmosphere the waiter ,waitress is wonderful it's really a down home kind of place...... now I know where my new Sunday night dinner place is can't wait till Sunday to try something else new."}
{"text":"Have to check this place out! We ordered the smothered pork chops with beef gravy sides were potato salad, mac and cheese and rice with gravy catfish with yams and mac and cheese. All really great! Very large portions and the waitress was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Oh man I can't say I would ever go back. I went here with my sister and well. Worst experience ever. We used to love it but when she was pregnant we went here and she was served under cooked chicken. they tried to say it wasn't but when it's still pink and a bit red I'd say not cooked. How could they serve that and let alone to a pregnant woman"}
{"text":"What caught my attention was the batter their catfish was fried in, very tasty! As well as their chicken fried steak topped with gravy. Plus their homemade potato salad was great:)
Same'ol fried chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Service is so so. Went in for an early dinner. Had to wait a while for tables to be cleaned (did not seem to be very busy either). Food took a while to come out, which is understandable, however we had to  ask for utensils.  Catfish and liver were delicious. Fried chicken was just okay. Had a funny after taste like old oil was used. Not sure if we'll go back."}
{"text":"The first time we ordered from here food was okay. Tonight whoever was at the register lacked customer service, they were out of everything, my husband ordered chicken and waffles when we got home the chicken was tasteless and they really had the nerve to give us a Waffle House waffle (Waffle House brands their waffles) the other food was no so good except the mac and cheese. Very sad to see a black owned small business lack as much as it did."}
{"text":"I received the most hospitable service. Anisha & Niecy made sure I was happy. Love those girls. I had the oxtails. I didn't need a knife to pull the meat from the bones. My side of yams and mac n cheese was great. Of course I took my leftovers back to my room. Every time I come into town this is where I will be coming to. Thank you for good food, good service and great prices."}
{"text":"Once again this place can do no wrong. Homemade goodness at all times. Every dish is delicious, so much so that going into a food coma after eating here is a compliment. Our server was Jazz, and what a great person. So much personality and genuinely helpful and NICE! We make a stop here every time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Experience:  This was bookmarked in my YELP and I was in the area. I convinced my friend to stop in and get Togo. 

Facility:  It's a small spot located inside of a strip mall. There were about 10 tables and chairs in the room, and a small ordering counter in the back. 

Service:  The young gal at the counter was super friendly and helpful. She helped me make my selections and even brought me my cornbread to the table while I was waiting, so I could take some medication.  
I believe it was the owner was at the counter too while I was ordering and she didn't really look my way or act friendly. She seemed like the type that is just so focused on getting the work done, she forgets to stop and smile at the customers. That's fine, as long as she is not rude, and the food is good, I'm not mad at her. LOL! 

Food:  The problem with soul food or southern or BBQ joints, is I want to taste every side dish. So I ordered a bunch. LOL! 
I got the fried chicken plate with Mac and cheese, greens, fried cabbage, French fries, and red beans. Greedy, huh??
Normally I would order the potato salad, but they let me taste a sample, and it was really sweet and had a distinct flavor I can't place, but is not my style. I like plain old, mayo/mustard/relish/eggs type potato salad. I call it southern style, but not sure the exact name. 
The cornbread (4/5) was good, with just a bit of sweetness, which I like. 
We ate the French fries (4/5) while we waited for the rest of the food. They were fresh, hot and pretty good. 
The chicken 3.5/5 was cooked well, but a tad too salty. 
The fried cabbage was my favorite 4/5, but the Mac and cheese 3/5, greens 3/5 and red beans 3/5 were just ok.  A tad bland. 
Is it bad to say I like my fried chicken, corn bread, Mac and cheese, and fried cabbage better?!  O.o

Overall: it was good, but M&Ms is closer, so I would probably just go there. 
If you're in the neighborhood, you should check it out though."}
{"text":"This is the best soul food I've ever tasted it takes me way back when I was a small child my uncle would cook his peach cobbler pies and put pears in them. You would dream about all good things in life my uncle was a good  cook god rest his soul this restaurant reminds me of him. So I'm loving all there foods I will try ever thing once or twice lol sincerely ellen"}
{"text":"Mom really enjoyed the food.  

Expect extremely slow service as the management refuses to hire more than one waitstaff and cook.   The two of them were hustling as best they could while the cashier person yapped with the \"carry-out\" customers.

Also, they do not serve dressing of any sort.  We found that odd."}
{"text":"I honestly don't see how anybody can give this place anything less than a 4 rating.. Everytime my husband and I visit Vegas (3 to 4 times a year) we ALWAYS make a effort to come and eat here. This place is absolutely delish NO MATTER what u order. Service is always fast and professional and food is always Delicious and HOT... Will be coming back to Vegas this weekend and of course like Always this will be our first Stop.. Fried Cabbage and Ox tails here we come.."}
{"text":"This was by far the best Soul food I've ever had while on vacation. I'm from the south and all the food taste just like my grandmother, great grandmother, mom aunts and uncles made the food. The collard greens,black eye peas, yams macaroni and cheese were absolutely the bomb. I'm a vegetable girl but I tried to the meatloaf, catfish and shrimp and they were good also. I've been telling everyone that if you go to Vegas you have to stop at Ellaem's. Staff was professional and the music was definitely on  point. After trying on buffet on the strip that was absolutely horrible and over priced I had to go back to my roots SOUL FOOD!!! awesome experience and I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner tonight for sure. Catfish and fried cabbage is a must!  Oxtail with rice and gravy was also very good! We will try fried chicken next time. Fast and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I am a white girl from Chicago. I don't know much about soul food but i do know BAR-B-Q!  EllaEm's has the BEST baby back ribs I've ever had (in Las Vegas.) I am surprised at some of the negative reviews here on Yelp, but thats what review are all about. 
Yes, it is hidden away in strip mall on Craig road between a Hawaiian Plate joint and a Teriyaki Madness chain. I decided to give it a try. I AM GLAD I DID!!  
 
We ordered take out because it was the day of the Emmy Awards. We wanted to eat and relax at home. We ordered the Baby Back ribs, collard greens, fried cabbage, yams and sweet potato pie for dessert. ALL ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!  the girls behind the counter were very personal and the place was immaculately clean and inviting. 

People!!! Don't be so picky, this is Las Vegas!  Sure, there are better places to eat.  However, i will definitely keep this on my TOP TEN places  to get GREAT BBQ in NORTH Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not very picky when it comes to food. I like to help out local businesses instead of the chain restaurants that have a a rep for using frozen foods and microwaves.   But in this instance I should have gone to KFC or Popeyes.  I called and placed a To-Go order for a fried chicken dinner.  I was told about 10-15 minute pick up time. It was closer to 35 minutes.  I asked for cup of water when I arrived and payed for my order.  I had to ask for it 2 more times before I got it. They weren't very busy. I had read other reviews that said service was lacking, so I kind of expected it.  Finally I got my food.  It smelled delicious.  My  drive home seemed eternal. 
I got home opened my Styrofoam plates only to find that they had put the gravy on top of my 2 pieces of chicken, i had asked for it on the side.   Oh well, i thought, it could be worse.  And then it was. The gravy was incredibly salty.  My sides were bland.  And then I realized they forgot my peach cobbler. I called and they said I could go by and pick it up because they would not refund my $7.  At that point I should have left mediocre-enough alone. I picked up the medium cobbler. It turned out to be 2 small containers w canned peaches in lots of nectar and some soggy crust.  McDonald's apple pies would have been a better choice.  I spent almost $40 on this meal.  I am very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"One Word Oxtails!!!!!!! Omg they are the best I ever had in 43yrs honestly everything here is bomb!!!! When you fly from Portland to Vegas just for their food  you know it's real!!!! And we have done that 4 times so far."}
{"text":"This has nothing to do with the food. I called trying to place an order the phone rang someone picked it up and hung up, then I called right back phone rang a long time a woman answered Ella Em's please hold, held on for 2 mins then they picked up and hung up. No I  tried to give them business guess they don't need any new business."}
{"text":"Just wanted good old homecooked food in a homey atmosphere and it brought me to EllaEm! The restaurant was welcoming by its decor. The food was fresh home made. I had the baked smothered chicken with actual chicken gravy! How any times do you go somewhere where you are not sure what kind of gravy it is? Not here! I had chicken gravy on my chicken and my husband had beef gravy on his meatloaf! The potatoes were homemade with cream. The yams were wondrrful! And the service was fabulous! The young lady waiting the tables could not have been nicer and swifter! She made me tired just watching her! We really enjoyed everything about our dining experience! A nice welcoming place to visit and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for the Thanksgiving weekend and decided to eat here on Friday.  I had theliver and onions with yams, rice with gravy and greens and my God was it good.  It was such delious food that I called my relatives and friens you lived in Vegas and we came back on Sat.  This time I had the meatloaf, fried cabbage, and blackeyed beans and again the food was awsome.   The waitress were also very nice and accommodating.   I will definitely  be back to EllaEms.

Every picture you see is exaxtly how your plate comes out."}
{"text":"The BEST soul food in LV so far.  Portions were very large and super tasty! I don't eat other people's potato salad but theirs was good. Definitely recommend this place and service was good"}
{"text":"We had a great meal here. LOVED the fried chicken ( dark meat although you can get breast meat if you prefer), fried fish, and ribs. Collard green were tasty, Mac and cheese a bit bland, yams were yummy (a little sweet for me but others liked them). Service was terrific and super nice. The only disappointment was the peach cobbler made with canned peaches and it had a soggy underdone crust. No need for dessert anyway because portions are generous. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Family owned & fabulous! this place is adorable! The prices are decent, waitresses are friendly and helpful. Food service is fast & delicious! They have a lunch special for $8!!!!!!!!!! Also, chicken gravy is on point."}
{"text":"OMG! Great food! The collard greens and black eyed peas were better than I grew up with!  No main entrée is even necessary. .. I got the fried chicken and my wife got the ribs.  Each entrée comes with 3 sides.  My wife got the fried cabbage and Mac and cheese (e both got the greens).  I'm not a big Mac and cheese lover but couldn't help but steal a few bites of hers. Simply awesome! 
Best fried chicken in Vegas hands down!  The ribs were also good. ..
Good service with nice kids serving.  The young man that waited on us had a real passion for the food and it showed in his body language and words. 
Dumbstruck going back soon!  Next is the catfish.  Saw it on a customers table.  Looked amazing! That customer was very happy!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!

I love this place! Red Snapper or Fried Chicken, greens, yams & Mac n cheese is what I usually get and it's . I've dined in twice and called in a take out order maybe 3 times both experiences went well. Customer service was great and my order is always served as requested. Check them out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ella Ems is the best soul food restaurant in Las Vegas. I love the lunch special with fried catfish, collard greens, and Mac n cheese. Delicious!!! The catfish is out of this world good. Always excellent service and the environment is laid back casual. Try them out...you will not be disappointed. Other favorites are the meatloaf, fried chicken, cabbage, red beans and gravy...aww man it's all good."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, I think the collard greens were the most outstanding item...really, really good!   We both had the fried chicken and it was fresh and super crispy.  

Nice environment and the servers are very lovely."}
{"text":"Best meatloaf I've found in Las Vegas!!  Staff act like they're glad you came.  $8 lunch specials."}
{"text":"Great soul food.  I rolled by and picked up the fried chicken \"to-go\".  I got home and it was soooo good.  Perfectly seasoned and spiced.

The food took a little long to cook (about 20 min) for a call in order but well worth it.  The staff was very helpful and attentive.  

Unfortunately, they only honor a military discount with the combo plates and not individual items.  Looks like ill have to roll by for a combo plate and try the catfish."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of fried chicken and this place serves phenomenal chicken, albeit a little pricey."}
{"text":"The only place in town I that I know of that sells chitterlings.. Only reason I didn't give it  more stars is bcuz the food is a little bland!"}
{"text":"After a full night of hardcore Vegas-style partying, I was in dire need of a fried chicken fix. We found EllaEm's Soul Food, and, BINGO! Exactly what I needed. The cafe style restaurant was very clean. I saw a few framed reviews on the walls raving about this place saying, it had \"The Best soul food in Vegas of 2010.\" I ordered the smothered chicken with collard greens, mash potatoes, and mac & cheese. We got it to-go and I couldn't wait to dig in. Whoa. Talk about a total food orgasm. Now, to all my fellow Yelpers, I will say no more about this place; only because I was extremely impressed beyond words. Therefore I insist that when you visit Las Vegas, this place is a must! I can't really begin to describe how great the food was. It sucks that I live here in San Diego...especially now since I will be craving those collard greens from Las Vegas. Geez."}
{"text":"My best friend and I have been twice in the last month, and I must say, it's that good. I had the fried cabbage for the first time and ended up ordering a side of it to go. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"A local Las Vegas resident suggested that I try Ella Em's while in town.  He stated that it was recently voted Best Soul Food in Las Vegas.  So I ventured off the strip and made the $20 Uber ride to the North side.

I ordered the smothered pork chop entree which comes with three sides and cornbread.  Already too much food but I kept my sides safe as I really am not too adventurous with my soul food.  Not everyone from the South has good food.  My sides were the yams, fried cabbage, and macaroni and cheese.  Nothing was awesome.  The yams were out of a can but they tasted as if they added nutmeg to give it their own special touch.  The fried cabbage was too salty for me to enjoy.  And the macaroni and cheese was just...wrong. 

My pork chops were three of the hugest slabs that I have ever seen.  They were the best part of my plate.  However, it made me wish that I ordered my beef gravy on the side; as they also were too salty.

It didn't take me long to get full with the huge portions and I ended up giving my leftovers to the beggar outside."}
{"text":"In one word: inconsistent. It's so frustrating too because the food that is good is VERY good but other things that you think should be an easy lock in for any southern or soul food place aren't. Customer service is questionable at best...

The fried chicken, VERY GOOD. Crispy skin, juicy, etc. The mashed potatoes, VERY BAD. Lumpy, super thick, clumpy etc. Yams=yummy, greens, meh. Their meatloaf and side of veggies YUM!! Cornbread cakes - get extra lol. Their ribs have great flavor but the beef tastes \"cheap\" and/or frozen for too long. Their customer service has been friendly exactly half the time too lol - out of four visits fielding my way through the menu I'm not sure I want to go back because the customer service is so inconsistent. In fairness, one time I believe the cook or dishwasher (both?) took my order himself -- either way, there's a reason that some people are better at back of the house than front of the house. I think this place has great potential but even after sampling several things I'm still utterly undecided so I hope this helps you more than it's helped me lol."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out. All I can say is yummy! I ordered the oxtail plate; it was so tender and flavorful. The corn bread also was pretty great it wasn't dry. Potatoes salad and fried okra was a plus. Will definitely be back. Can't really do a 5star because I ordered take out"}
{"text":"Came in to place a to go order. Waited a little less than an hour for my order (wasn't super busy or slow).  So don't expect a speedy order. I ordered the Catfish Special. Comes with 3 sides (a bit excessive, imo) and a cornbread muffin. Came out close to $20. I ordered macaroni and cheese, fries and red beans & rice as my sides. The catfish and fries were tasty. Macaroni was decent. Disappointed with the red beans & rice, probably would've been better had rice not been so dry/overcooked. I was satisfied overall. Willing to try more of the menu. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here more often since we had recently moved back to North Las Vegas; however, the quality in entrees have changed a bit, such as the catfish and pork chops. And I'm pretty certain the cornbread serving has shrunk in size.The sides are still amazing, i.e. fried cabbage, potato salad, and greens. The service is still very fun and friendly. This place will still be my go to soul food restaurant, just thought I would be eating here everyday like I used to."}
{"text":"EllaEm,s a unique house of soul food. As soon as you walk in you are greeted with a smile and very friendly staff. We had the lunch special catfish and two sides of your choice and fresh hot cornbread that was lip smacking. 
If your in the area give them a try, there was nothing wrong I give 4 stars cause there is always room for more improvement."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb !!!  This will definately be one of my new Vegas spots  this place reminds me of my mommas cooking.    Everything was hot and fresh   Awesome"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place a try. The serious was excellent however the boy that was helping out didn't know what he was doing. They was running the place with only 3 ppl! Room a long time to get our food. We order the chicken with dressing and greens. The dressing was \"box\" dressing! horrible! We changed for mashed potatoes and those were horrible as well. We were highly disappointed because we paid $25 for crap! The prices are ridiculous! Also they offer at lunch special that is $10.99...is that really a special? It's very far from the strip as well. 21 mins to be exact. M&M bakery is way better. We went there the night before and the food was stellar! If I were you don't waste your time on this place. Waste of money!"}
{"text":"A 'must go' everytime I come to Vegas.  Had the chicken n waffles this time, A+ all around.  I've never had anything I didn't like there.  And they play good eatin' music!"}
{"text":"Amazing....4 different orders and everything was Great...Service was wonderful...definitely commands a repeat visit when in town!"}
{"text":"this place is delicious! i had come to the conclusion soul food is difficult to make as restaurant cusine, and was convinced soul food wasn't to be ordered out. but this place has changed my opinion. everything we ordered was good. i highly recommend. their award as best soul food restaurant in Las Vegas is well-earned"}
{"text":"The service is great. Waitress are attentive to service. The food however is lacking. Yams are canned they cover them in syrup so it looks like yam soup. Corn muffins! Any basic recipie is better. Red beans  way to spicy hot (let customer decide  serve peppers/hot sauce on side) 
oxtails  were either undercooked or reheated they were chewy and not served hot"}
{"text":"When you go to a place two nights in a row the food has got to be legit! If you are in North Vegas and don't have a meal here you have seriously did yourself a disservice. The portions-perfect. The food-AMAZING! The atmosphere-welcoming, classic, relaxed. The staff-Kim has been amazing; she always has a smile on her face and a great personality. I will be back again and again!
Don't EllaEm's...it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food was the bomb... great service I will be back.. all you can drink Kool-Aid the shiznit"}
{"text":"Bad Food Bad Service Went To Place A Order Didn't Get Greeted Because the Front Staff Were To Busy With There Conversation To Greet Customers I Got Ny Food Asked For Extra Hot Sauce and Ketchup Went To Open My Bag So They Could Put It In The Bag And They Jist Tossed It On The Counter So I Put The Sauce In My Bag Got Home With My Food My Corn Bread Was Burnt My Mac Abd Cheese Was Old And Very Gritty Like Eating Sand The Fried Chicken Was Unseasoned and Flavorless as Was The Yams Tasted Like Nothing But Corn Syrup Had No Spice To It Whatsoever This Is Not Real Soul Food  So If That's What Your Looking For Please Don't Stop At This Place"}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas, this place is a MUST!!! Lawd, the food is just like granny used to make! Good ole down home southern cooking. The staff hands down are awesome as well!!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed!

My Chicken & Waffles craving led me to a long awaited bookmark, right next door to my favorite Hawaiian spot in town!

Ordered the Wingettes & Waffle (Lunch Special). The chicken was good, crispy and juicy with a very tasty waffle!  Not my favorite chicken in town, but it was done well, and the waffle was great!

Eva had the Fried Pork Chops (Lunch Special). Comes with two sides...we chose Black Eyed Peas and Collard Greens. The pork chops were pretty much PERFECT! Very thin, crispy and tender...so good!  Doesn't get much better than this guys!

On a side note, the Cornbread here is DELICIOUS!  It comes out piping hot with just the right amount of moisture inside....like a great cake.  It doesn't even need BUTTER!  

And to finish, we were recommended the Peach Cobbler. This was good as well. I liked the crust/breading here...they make this fresh in-house.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting EllaEms's. I sooo want to like this place especially since Granny reminds me of my Granny. I just love looking at her picture on the menu & in the restaurant. Service: A- I ordered take out and there was only one waitress who was cleaning, taking orders, etc. Price: B-A bit pricey but I can deal. Food: C/C- The food was just bland, bland, bland. No real seasoning. I'm from S. Carolina so I know down home cooking, but I was very dissapointed. I ordered the chicken (bland but fried good), fried cabbage (Ummmm so-so), and the macaroni (tasted like paper; wth)...Dont mean to be harsh but this food was not good. Seemed pretty busy so I'm guessing I'm outnumbered...Probably wont return for a 3rd time."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place... I truly wanted a good experience as I really needed some soul food in my life.  

The verdict? Absolutely terrible service. Granted, the place was slammed with customers; however, my order wasn't huge nor special.  

We were initially told 20 minutes and ended up waiting an hour.  When the food came out, half the sides were missing and though we ordered peach cobbler for a desert, they failed to tell us it was out of stock until our order was delivered missing the item.  It was rudely replaced with lemon cake that was mediocre. 

As for the meal: I got the fried fish plate with 3 sides, and my friend ordered chicken and waffles and an extra side of macaroni & cheese.  For my meal: The fish was fine. Nothing too special, but certainly okay.  The black eyed peas were my favorite!  My mashed potatoes and macaroni were laughable.  The macaroni looked as if someone took raw noodles and mixed it with shredded cheddar cheese.  And the mashed potatoes were very bland.  

As for the chicken and waffles... this was the most offensive part of the meal.  $13.99 for one dry waffle, and 3 small chicken wings.  No syrup, no sides, no love.  And they forgot his Macaroni & Cheese.  

Needless to say, I will not be returning.    They call this a soul food joint, but they lack soul and compassion."}
{"text":"It was my first time to dine there last week, I just have to say that the service, and especially the food, was excellent!!! Anisha, my server extraordinaire, was just lovely! She was very knowledgable about the entire menu, extremely accommodating, and was so much sweeter than my sweet tea! I will definitely come back, with even more friends next time! I think I've found myself a new soul food hang out! My goal is to try everything on the menu, and eventually go back and make a few favorites! The place may be far away from my house, but it is definitely worth the trip! For that kind of food, and with that amazing service, you will be coming back for more! It'll feed your belly and your soul! Much love, EllaEm's staff! (Especially to Anisha!!!) Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Very warm welcome when you enter. Food was prepared freshly and delivered in a scrumptious display. Kind of expensive 4 people with regular size dinner meals came up to $90."}
{"text":"This small cafe has all the right ingredients-nicely decorated, friendly staff and great food!  I ordered food to go and it was bagged up fresh and hot.  I had the chicken fried steak with gravy, macaroni and cheese and collard greens.  It was truly delicious!
I would have give it 5 stars but for the cornbread.  I was expecting a large square and only got a small circular piece.  A big piece of cornbread would have topped off the perfect meal!  Will definitely go again and again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here last week.  DEAR LORD!  BEST soul food EVER!  Catfish is a must here, and the peach cobbler is fantastic!  The collard greens were really good too!!!  

Serving plates were a little weird, as it seemed everything was separate.  Gave me a cafeteria feel.  Other than that, just perfect.

The waitresses were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Cornbread Muffins
Fried Chicken, Chicken Gravy, Fried Okra, Mac n' Cheese, Candied Yams
Sweet Potato Pie
Red Velvet Cake

Tucked away in a strip mall on West Craig Road in North Las Vegas, but frequented by locals and those within the proper city limits for what some consider to be the best Soulfood in The Valley, it was just after 5pm that I entered the stripped down confines of  EllaEm's for a bite before dinner and although several take-out orders unfortunately caused a rather lengthy delay from the kitchen one would be hard-pressed to name another place offering a more authentic experience, particularly at such a price.

Not at all billed to be the upscale experience of Yardbird and far less often discussed than either location of underwhelming M&M Soul Food Cafe found further South, it was at a four-top surrounded by a crowd of all ages and ethnicities that I was seated mere moments after entry and perusing the menu it a young Hispanic hostess offered smiling greetings before filling water and presenting the first of two rounds of complimentary cornbread muffins, each bite tinged with sweetness amidst a delicate yet toothsome base.

Offering a la carte options, but generally a far better deal when ordered as a combo or traditional \"Meat + 3,\" it was in rejecting temptation offered by fried pork chops as well as several other entrees that my original target of EllaEm's signature fried chicken was selected and although attempts to add-on a waffle were thwarted by poor kitchen timing the nearly thirty minute wait was rewarded by two legs and a thigh of crisply breaded brined bird, the spice profile well represented straight through the skin and into the flesh while sides of yams and fried okra were reference standard in execution, the man & cheese largely forgettable with overcooked noodles plus a soupy thin sauce.

Apologies offered by the young server for the missing waffle and delays that were in no way her fault, there was little doubt that a meal at any Southern eatery was likely to end without a sampling of dessert, and although the lack of banana pudding would seem to be a serious menu oversight both the small slice of warm red velvet cake and one of Sweet Potato pie were far better than one may have expected, the former far sweeter than other cocoa-laden iterations while the latter atop a crisp and flaky crust impressed by taking the traditional savory route.

****No doubt one of \"Hidden Gems\" of North Las Vegas, an area oft lamented for a dearth of quality places to dine, EllaEm's offers not only a relative bargain for the dollar but also some of the city's very best fried chicken and Red Velvet Cake, no small praise considering the omnipresence of each on menus throughout town."}
{"text":"Was staying in the area for the Rise festival a d wanted to grab a bite.  Found this on yelp and decided to give it a try.  Very glad we did. A friendly staff greeted us. We had the meatloaf with red sauce and the fried chicken.  The plates come with 3 sides,  we got dressing, greens, sweet potatoes, fried cabbage, mashed potatoes, and potato salad.  The sweet potatoes were the only item that we weren't wowed by. Wil return here next year for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried catfish, fried cabbage, fried okra, and yams. Delicious! The food was fresh and hot, and flavor was incredible. The service could improve, but overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise! Originally planned to go to Poke Express next door but totally forgot that they are closed on Wednesday so we decided to visit Ella Em for some soul food grub. 

We were warmly greeted at the door by Victor who seated us right away. Entrees were a little bit on the high side ($9-15) yet still not too expensive considering you get 4 large sides including the corn bread. We also learned that lunch specials tend to run between $7-$9 and it comes with 2 sides. They also offer 10% military discount.

We ordered: 
Pork chop - This reminds me of how we cook pork chop in the Philippines! Well seasoned and tasty.
Rice & gravy - Basic rice here, nothing to write home about. The gravy was nice and and you get to choose between chicken and beef gravy. Both were delicious, but I prefer the beef gravy. I would probably skip this next time and order another side in the future.
Collard greens - Not a big fan of collard greens in general but hubby said it was good (But he had better when he was in Mississippi).
Fried cabbage - DELICIOUS! Sooo homey and definitely a big hit for both of us and we licked that bowl off for sure! We should have ordered more of these. 
Fried chicken (2 pcs) - Juicy and crispy! I love fried chicken cooked this way, lightly battered and seasoned with Granny's special seasoning. 
Mashed potatoes - Tastes like how we make it at home. Between my husband and I we could have skipped it but my daughter will probably not like that cause it's her staple.
Yams - Soooo good. Sweet with a touch of cinammon!
Corn bread - I love their corn bread but it was waaay too tiny. You can order more for 50 cent a piece. Wish they would make it thicker.

All the food that came out were freshly made and the service was friendly, we felt like we're eating home cooked meal on Thanksgiving. The kitchen is super busy with several to-go orders and it was barely 4pm, but we never felt neglected by our server. We will be back to try their catfish, oxtail, and peach cobbler. Was it authentic? I possess no authority whatsoever on southern-style cooking, but my soul was definitely tickled with such a positive dining experience."}
{"text":"EllaEm's popped my soul food cherry, and since I have absolutely nothing to compare it to (besides the chicken and waffles at Roscoe's), I'm gonna say that this place is freaking delicious. 

I ordered the fried catfish. It comes with any 3 sides of your choice. I originally chose the Mac & cheese, potato salad, and mashed potatoes with beef gravy, but our waitress said they were out of potato salad at the moment so I settled for the candied yams instead. My boyfriend ordered the Wingettes & Waffles, which is just chicken wings and a waffle. 

The fried catfish was cooked great. It wasn't too oily at all. The Mac and cheese tasted no different from any other Mac and cheese but the mashed potatoes and candied yams were probably the best I ever had, and I don't even like yams lol. The portions of both the catfish and the sides were huge. So big that there was no way I could've finished it all no matter how hard I was trying. My boyfriend's chicken and waffles were also delicious. The waffle was kinda thin but it was still really flavorful to me. I didn't try the fried chicken wings by itself but the way they cook their chicken and their homemade waffle recipe made for a perfect combination. 

About 15 minutes after we started eating, our waitress came back to our table with a side of potato salad for me, on the house, because she felt bad that they didn't have any when she took my order. So that was really nice. The potato salad was just okay though /: I actually felt kinda bad that I didn't like it more than I did since she was giving it to me for free and all lol.

I'd rate their service a 4.9 out of 5 though. Only because when we first walked in we were instantly confused. We weren't greeted at the door by a hostess or anything so we weren't sure if we were supposed to go up to the counter and order or wait to be seated or seat ourselves. (FYI you seat yourselves) Out waitress was really nice. She took care of us; never let our cups go empty, checked up on us an appropriate amount of times, made us feel comfortable and at home, and she even complimented me on my eyes lol. (I gave her an extra couple dollars for her tip for that one haha) By reading the reviews, I noticed a lot of people complaining about how \"slow\" their service is. I am wholeheartedly disagreeing with that. Yeah, they're not fast food restaurant speedy, but for the fact that they're actually COOKING their food made to order and for how much food they put on the plate, their service is undeserving of being called slow. But that's just my opinion.

All in all, very good. And I will definitely be going back again... and again and again and again lol."}
{"text":"I came here on a wednesday, during my lunch break, and ordered the lunch special: chicken with collard greens and rice and gravy. Military discount 10%, came out to 8. 

- YUMMY cornbread! Can I get another :)?
- One salty piece of chicken and the other made perfectly with the right crisp. Weird.
- I shouldn't have gotten the rice and gravy. Average. May I should have gotten yams or mac and cheese? french fries?!
- Collard greens are okay. I tasted that bitter after flavor after awhile. 
- SLOW SERVICE! If you have an hour lunch, don't expect to be at work on time.
- Unique? I like the decor and music (High school flashback R&B)! OBAMA :D"}
{"text":"Just tried Ella Em's Soul Food for the first time.  DELICIOUS   I had ox tails, my favorite with gravy rice, yams and collard greens.  Everything was perfect.   The oxtails were tender and flavorful, the greens cooked just right, not too salty, not too heavy.  The yams were pretty and sweetened to perfection.  I'm a flight attendant so I dine on all kinds of food all over the world and believe me.  Ella Em's is the real thing.  I hope they stay around.  It's a 30 minute drive from my house, good thing it's not closer or my ass would be as big as a 747.  Worth the drive and the darling girl waitress is adorable."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is lacking. I went there for lunch and there were only 4 people in the restaurant and I waited 30 minutes to find out they never placed my order. During that time at least 12 more people were served."}
{"text":"*cough* bullshit *cough* I want my money back (40$) I got the smothered chicken red beans and rice and yams. My kid liked the yams my smothered chicken wasn't Fuckin smothered it was just regular friend chicken like what the helllllllll!!!!! Also the lemonade was 4$!!!!!!!!! The\"sweet tea\" for 3$ was from the machine and tasteless at that. but after waiting for 35 minutes at 2:00 already I just said fuck it and triiiiied to eat it it tastes like.... let's just say I should've went to Popeyes bro -_-"}
{"text":"Great food and attentive staff!  The fried catfish is on point along with the mac and cheese. I thought my mamma was in the kitchen cooking. Ramon was the best with making sure I was satified with service and food.  Everything was awesome."}
{"text":"When we came in we weren't sure if we were supposed to wait to be seated or seat ourselves. When we walked to the counter they told us to take a seat and they will ring us the menus. Took an hour for the dressing to get ready so they comped our meals when we said we were leaving. Food was very good."}
{"text":"We've only been here a few times but the food is excellent each time. Service can be a bit slow, but the food is phenomenal. Best black eyed peas I've had in years!"}
{"text":"My Daughter & I Just Waited over An Hour sitting at the table waiting for our food just for the lady to come back up to us to say we forgot to put your order in what did you want. I can't believe we just wasted over a hour of our day sitting there! I'm so mad right now we drove across town to this place just for this to happen I left but I can never get my time back & my child is still hungry"}
{"text":"My second attempt at Soul Food in Vegas landed me at EllaEm's. I am much more pleased with this experience over Gritz Cafe. I was greeted promptly by a beautiful young lady who was very attentive throughout my dining experience. I ordered the fried pork chops with fried cabbage and collard greens. My food arrived hot and the portion size was just right. If you're looking for soul food in Vegas, the quest ends here."}
{"text":"This place was on our radar for some time, but we kept putting other places ahead of it. We were first in as the doors opened, it's a small place, all tables, the menu was your basic \"southern\" one with everything from smothered chicken, to oxtails and meatloaf. 

I ordered the meatloaf and it came with three sides, I picked the mac n cheese, the collard greens and black eyed peas. The slice of meatloaf was about 1/2 inch thick but very small compared to most. 

The sides were pretty good, the exception was the mac n cheese, it wasn't very thick cheesy, but runny and not much cheese flavor. Corn bread served with the meal was sweet cake kind, served warm. I liked the meal, but I grew up in the south, and we ate pretty good, the portions were large and filled up our plate, this plate was bare in places, so it made me think, they must be a little stingy with the servings."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place for some time now but never had the time to stop in. Today I went in for lunch and had the catfish. I've been living in Vegas for 17 years now and this place by far has the best catfish I've ever tried. It comes with a variety of sides ( I chose potato salad and Black Eyed Peas) which where also amazing. If you want some good home cooked soul food definitely have to come try this place out. I will be back again for sure. The service was outstanding and the food was beyond explainable good...."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, but to super long to get with not many patrons at the time of 8pm, plus only one waiter, on Valentines night, felt bad for him then felt bad for the people who came in at 830pm and were turned away only to ask : \" but on the front door doesnt it say you close at 9pm?!\"...my lady ordered the Wingettes n waffles which were the bomb and I ordered the country fried steak, which was super good but it was cut into 4 pieces of what looked to be a small piece, though it was filling, the service really could use some help.
I actually parked in front of the hawaiian place and wanted to eat there but looked over and decided to give this Soul Food joint a try, all in all the food was awesome, service not so much. I only tipped the boy because he looked so overwhelmed and deserved it!"}
{"text":"I saw EllaEms on Groupon Now, but couldn't use it that day. Last week.my 80 year old mom and I were in the neighborhood and decided to give it a try. OMG! I had the smothered pork chops, mashed potatoes and gravy and fried cabbage. Everything was cooked perfectly and delicious.  My mom, who has gotten really picky, said her catfish was the best she has ever had (and she's had plenty). she loved the mustard  potato salad and french fries.(two items she is usually especially critical of)  I know, 2 carbs, right? but she's 80 and can eat whatever she wants. The restaurant was clean and inviting, the server was friendly and helpful. Even my cranky mom had no complaints. This restaurant is 30 minutes from where I live, but it is worth the drive and we will be regular customers."}
{"text":"I had eaten at Ella's a couple years ago with a friend. We both enjoyed the food but the location is so far from my home so I hadn't returned. 
Today I was craving some good ole fried chicken and Mac and cheese. I was in the area so I decided to stop at Ella Elm's. 
When the cashier brought out my order she said \"grilled fish.\" And I said \"no I ordered the fried chicken.\" 
So they \"fixed\" my order. I was in a hurry to go, silly me. I didn't check the bag. When I got home I discovered that I got black eyed peas instead of Mac n cheese. I got white meat chicken and I asked for dark. 
The only thing I liked was the chicken. It was fresh and juicy. The red beans and rice were not good. Tasted more like chili. I also had the peach cobbler which was too sweet and tasted like something was missing. 
I will probably not be back."}
{"text":"The food is good, however they raised the lunch prices from $10.99 to $14.99. Isnt that a dinner price?"}
{"text":"Great food... Had the Ox tails with Mac and cheese... Great food, cooked right gravy was on point, the corn bread hit the spot.... The Mac was pretty good and they give you a lot of ox tails also...."}
{"text":"Great place for great food. All the good here is good. The atmosphere is nice and laid back. Service is outstanding. One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying the food is absolutely AMAZING. I dined with three other people and we all ordered a different dish. Satisfaction overload!!! We were all very pleased and the service was excellent! Las Vegas isn't know for having the best soul food restaurant but this cozy and quaint restaurant has changed that prospective for me! The waitress was very attentive to our needs and made us feel right at home. I must say I'm no easy customer to please so when I say, I've had great service, the average person would consider it the BEST service. I will warn you a place this small with food that amazing gets a little hectic on a Sunday afternoon so I'd try dining there on the weekdays as I've made a few failed Sunday attempts."}
{"text":"Pretty solid and delicious soul food! 

They had mixed up our order, so instead of taking it back...they let us keep the extra plate then brought out the corrected order! How awesome was that! Lots of businesses take it back, I always wondered what they did with an uneaten plate. Do they throw it away? Serve it to someone else? Gross. I'm regressing.

I had their oven baked ribs. Deliciously baked! Lathered in bbq just the way me likey. Husband had the liver and onions. Of course the husband enjoyed his! Lol. He really loved their fried cabbage. Their mac n cheese was pretty yummy too, and I'm not a complete mac-n-cheese person. Their prices are pretty decent too. Soul food in other areas of this world charge soul food like catfish is a rare species, collard greens are grown from gold, and ribs are a season. 

Anyway, awesome to have deliciously prepared comfort food nearby. Definitely recommend them. Service was great! Seeing family pics on the wall just feels nice. Reminds you they are deep with their roots. That's probably what makes them deelish. It's homely."}
{"text":"I ordered the chittling dinner to go, this was my first time eating there. Will never eat there again. The chittlings were not that good. Would have gotten 4 stars if they would have compensated me in some way for a $19.00 meal that I didn't enjoy. Talked to someone and they wanted me to bring the sides back, are you kidding. I don't live near there. You have lost a customer for ever. I am a Louisiana native and know what they should taste like. I even cook them on occasion. M & M's is way better."}
{"text":"super delicious. The best part? it's right next door to us. So glad we finally get a decent soul food in LAS VEGAS PERIOD. Whether you dine in or do a take out, it;s sure to be a tummy filled meal."}
{"text":"100% would recommend this place! Good food and good service. Can be kind of slow so don't go if you're in a rush, but everything is cooked to order and is worth the wait. Wish I had one where I lived."}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions. At the counter they ask if you want white or dark chicken. I wish they would have told me white was an extra $2."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about how good it was.

Fried Chicken was seasoned perfectly and was not too crispy nor too soggy.  Yams were nice & sweet, and the Mac & Cheese is worth doubling up on.  Finally, the cornbread muffin to top it off.  My son had the ribs and said they were the best--better than Famous Dave's, John's Roadkill, Friday's Jack Daniel's glazed.  

Not too expensive, especially considering how much food you get.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on Thursday afternoon and the place was packed! Great sign, usually, so my giddiness continued as I waited for my friend and hungrily watched other patrons place their orders and receive their lunches. The place is cute, clean, and comfortable. There were two large parties (one leaving, one ordering) when I came in. All in all a good vibe, good music in the background that still allowed for conversation, and smiles abound. I was excited!

It pretty much ended there. I really, really, really wanted to like this place. I would have preferred to have loved this place, but I would have settled for an \"I love you, but not in THAT way\" sort of conversation here. 

Alas, I am not sure I want a second date.

First: The service was VERY slow. Yes, it's a small place. And mostly it was service with a smile. But it was slow. We all but flagged the waiter down to order our drinks. And then again to order lunch. He kept pointing out how slammed they were. I could see it, I sort of get it, but then there should be more help on the floor. He was genuinely kind and happy to help us, but it doesn't make up for the fact that once both of us were seated, it took 15 minutes-plus to finally let them know what we wanted to eat. Add to that the wait for the food itself? My hour lunch was approaching an hour and I hadn't had anything to eat yet.

Never got a drink refill. Had to ask for silverware. Getting the to-go boxes (I took those greens to go!) and the checks was OK, but then had to wait for the payments to be processed while watching the waiter do other things.

OK, OK, there were SOME good points.

Here we go... food. I decided to try the liver and onions. You get to choose three (huge portions here!) sides. I went with mac and cheese, collard greens, and fried cabbage. (Oy, I did not come here expecting to adhere to any diet, that's for sure!)

The large portion of liver was cooked perfectly but the cut was off. Too much connective tissue running through it. I'd rather smaller pieces cut away from the parts you can't chew/eat. It had a hint of a breading/coating on it that was not bad, not over the top. But I had a small bit where it was all flour. No bueno.

The collard greens were the best ever. Seriously. Eat them. (Insert \"Eat All The Greens! meme here.)

The mac was good, definitely homemade. I only tasted it because pasta is not my friend, but the flavors and composition were really decent. Not amazing, but decent.

The cabbage was, against all odds, really great. Too oily/buttery for MY tastes, but still managing not to be wilted and brown; it was bright, a tad crisp. Surprisingly good but slightly over on the grease scale for MY tastes (trying to be fair... it is, after all, \"fried cabbage!\").

S's massive portion of meatloaf with rice with gravy were good, she said, though the yams were a tad on the raw side. She also had the mac and agreed: good, yes, tasty, but nothing to write home about. (To go box for the food here, too, so that says a little something.)

Another thing I didn't love? The photos on the menu didn't seem to totally match the food. Not just like, \"hey, mine doesn't look like that,\" but in a \"they don't even offer that on their menu!\" sort of way. I felt cheated that I couldn't order cole slaw or green beans, even though they were so prominently displayed.

Huge portions of mostly OK-ish food. Smiley but slooooow service. Prices are fine based on portions, but when it's just OK? *sigh* 

Just not excited about a return trip."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this resturant for a long time and since my mom was visiting we decided to give it a try. I ordered \"homemade lemonade\" which was NOT made with fresh lemons.
The catfish did not taste like catfish at all, it tasted more like that cheap fish, the texture was a little off. I also had a side of beans and rice, mac and cheese, and greens. I really only like the greens. I didn't order any dessert. If I try this place again I will order something different."}
{"text":"Fo Shizzle my chicken Dizzle...

I like this place!  The place is fairly basic inside, kind of a retro - modern vibe too it.  It is set up more like a quick serve place but it has waitress service.

The service was friendly and homey.  They had some lunch specials for $8 or more.  The Fried chicken special was $8 for 2 pieces and 2 sides.  I had mac and cheese & greens... I almost ordered 2 sides of greens --- Iove greens.

The fried chicken was good.  Very lightly breaded, crispy skin and juicy on the inside.  The seasoning on the fried chicken was a little boring but the chicken was cooked just right.  I did experience an unpleasant bite when there seemed to be a nugget of salt all in one bite.  I guess that happens sometimes.  The mac and cheese was pretty good.  The greens were tender and full of flavor.  Soul food has a ton of salt in it, just in my opinion the salt could be toned down.  Of course, I wouldn't mess with a family recipe that has been passed down through the generations just because some Asian guy said something on Yelp.

While I was eating the chicken I looked at my fingers and they didn't have any grease on them.  I realized that the chicken was not greasy at all.  Just crispy & Juicy.

The $8 lunch special over all was excellent.  The portions were generous.  The food was way above average soul food.  I would prefer a real piece of cornbread instead of the little muffin they serve.  I will go back fo sho!"}
{"text":"It's my first time at this place and all I can say the food are so delicious. I ordered the oxtail and when I saw it I was shocked and say WOW the serving are huge. I love there food."}
{"text":"Soul food--yum!.  I bought a Groupon to this place after having read the Yelp reviews and there's a reason it's so highly rated.  I went with my teenage son and his father for dinner tonight, and when we arrived around 7:00pm, the place had only two other tables occupied.  It's a clean, nicely decorated, small place in a strip mall.  I ordered the oxtail stew and three sides: mac n cheese (eh, I've had better at TC's Rib Crib), mashed potatoes and gravy, and yams.  The latter two side dishes were done well and the oxtails themselves were fabulous!  I couldn't finish my food, so you definitely get your money's worth.  Each entree comes with the three sides, so that could also be why I was in a food coma afterwards.  Before our main dishes arrived, we were each served cornbread, which was heavenly--I wanted more, but didn't ask because I could have gotten full on that alone.  My son and his dad had the fried catfish and they rated it better than Hush Puppy's--the gold standard according to them.  I don't eat fish, but just looking at their food, I could tell it wasn't as greasy as the catfish I've seen at other places.  
 Service was great, the food is delicious, and the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is that I'm a stickler for good mac n cheese, and theirs was just okay.  So, if you're every hankering for some good Southern cooking, head over to EllaEm's for the kind of food that sticks to your ribs and leaves you feeling satisfied...the guilt sets in much later."}
{"text":"I have eaten food all over the south and I can say this is some of the best soul food I have ever had. Fried chicken, collards, fried okra and black eye peas all were great. I will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Done! This is the last time I will give my money to this restaurant. I had left this place alone a few years ago after there and the kitchen exploded! I have eaten maybe once or twice in last 3 years, but after today....no more! I paid $57 for three pretty shiity meals. They have gone up on their prices ridiculously. Not worth the money at all. So sad when we try to get over on our own."}
{"text":"This had been maybe my 5th time to EllaEm's thanks to Groupon. I had always had a pleasant experience until last nite. NEVER go at night. The service was HORRIBLE. My friends and i walked in, you couldnt miss us, 3 adults with 4 kids. We sat ourselves down and no one acknowledged us. There were only 3 other guests sitting at tables so it wasnt busy at all. So we sat, and sat, until i got a little anxious and finally one waitress walks over past my table didnt look at me and go to my friends table and pass her one menu...I was thinking didnt that silly girl see all of us walk in and why would she only give her one menu then turn around and walk away. I wondered were me and my kids invisible?? Well finally another waitress came over Heather to take my order and all. Tonight my review of the place is mostly of the service because that determines whether i want to spend my time and money at a place where the employees are so very rude.
My friends and i had sat at two different tables next to each other since it was 8 of us. Their waitress (the rude one) had taken their drink request and all before mine did, however my waitress brought out my drinks and cornbread before theirs did and when she did i watched as she kinda slammed it on the table WTH?
Another couple came into the door an ederly couple and she was right on them as soon as they hit the door with their menus and giving them their drinks and they had not been in the door 5 full minutes. I know we counted. SO this really mad my friends mad.
I can say this the other few times i have come to EllaEms it was during the day time so maybe the day shift is friendlier, Ramon is the waiter usually there that i see and he has always given me and my friends good service. BUT last night LaRonda the rudest swinging her hair waitress has left a bad taste in my mouth. And after reading more reviews i see other people complaints about the very slow service. I would like to give them another try but i am not too sure about that.
And to hear they are microwaving the food YUK i can do that at home. THAT really makes me think twice!!!"}
{"text":"I had EllaEm's Soul Food for lunch today. While the service and restaurant was phenomenal, the food itself was lack luster. First and foremost, everything was cooked perfectly, my issue is the lack of flavor. I ordered the lunch special for $9.99 and had fried chicken, macaroni & cheese and fries. The only item that had any flavor was the fries, everything else was bland. I would try this restaurant again because the service was awesome and who knows maybe they had a bad day in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Was not impressed for a soul food place. Don't order the greens, you are better off making a batch at home. The ribs had no meat and the cornbread is just jiffy mix. Note to self: Eat at home!!!

Down south Georgia girl."}
{"text":"Great staff and the food is excellent. Meatloaf is perfect and cobbler is on point. Will stop here everytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best soul food ! Honestly you feel at home in this place  the food is bomb and the workers are very nice ."}
{"text":"Always love EllaEms. Got the ox tails and they were fabulous! Hunny got the fried chicken (as good as it always is) the huge sides were great and with many choices."}
{"text":"The service is so slow, ordered a catfish dinner with greens, mashed potatoes Mac & cheese the fish and potatoes were hot the other two cold as ice. Staff is friendly but needs to work on speed even on a slow day it took them forever!"}
{"text":"The food was so delicious, we had chicken and waffles that was excellent! Only down side was it took quite a while to get the food but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"*sigh* I am not the one to write bad reviews, but I had to say something about an individual that works here. When we sat down a young man came to our table and didn't really greet us and asked for our drink order. I asked for a unsweetened tea and my boyfriend asked for a sweet tea-we got 2 sweet teas. Then he acted as if he were bothered that he had to get me an unsweetened tea. Then I noticed how much energy/enthusiasm as he was serving two young BLACK females. Very complimentary towards them even calling them his \"beautiful Nubian queens\" aha, I got it now. He was treating us poorly because we are an interracial couple. I guess I wasn't \"black enough\" for his liking. 

I saw other ppl got cornbread while they were waiting for their meal and checked on-not us. I even saw him clock out and leave and didn't even bother to tell us that someone else was going to take over and that he was leaving. After waiting for a while another server saw we were waiting and introduced herself, got us cornbread and was shocked that no one offered that to us while we waited. She was nice and made up for the initial experience. I appreciate her efforts. The food was good (I prefer the Soul Food cafe). 

But I am SO disappointed that people are so bothered by who I love. And that you are so bothered that you would go to such great lengths to make me feel so uncomfortable. I feel sorry for you. I feel sorry that you are so small minded. I feel sorry that you will never experience life outside of north Las Vegas. I feel sorry that my happiness makes you so uncomfortable. Most of all I feel sorry for anyone else you come in contact with at that restaurant that you don't seem worthy of your service-which you are getting paid to do-as they won't patronize an establishment due to your lack of intelligence."}
{"text":"It was the best chicken and waffles ever and the service very friendly. My fiance who ate at  Roscos in La when he lived there said it even beat them for their chicken and waffles . So we recommend it to all our friends who live here and come here to visit."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch after a movie.  The food was pretty good.  I had ox tails with sides of greens, yams, and rice & gravy.  I was a little disappointed that the rice was slightly under-cooked, but everything was was yummy.  I could only eat half before I felt the need to take a nap :-).  My friend had chicken and waffles.  He was disappointed in the waffles, stating they lacked comparison with Roscoe's.  However, he did love the fried, smothered chicken.

The staff there is always friendly and inviting.  I will definitely be going back in the near future."}
{"text":"Q was our server and was on it. The food was all seasoned right and you know I can very down in the kitchen and this was up to my standards. I had the pork chops fried get them you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came hungry and left so satisfied. Can I get an amen from the church about that catfish and those greens. Good Lordy. Definitely worth checking out when in town!!!!  Tell em' Lani sent ya!"}
{"text":"Four of us tried EllaEm's for lunch.  Restaurant was very clean; had a 60's diner fell.
Lunch specials were $8. Which included 2 sides.  Portions were very generous.

I tried the fried catfish with Mac & cheese, and red beans & rice.  I received 5 ample pieces of fish which was nicely breaded.  Sides were very tasty. 

Second fried ordered baked chicken with fried cabbage.  Cabbage was flavored well.  Chicken was very moist, and nearly fell off,the bone.  

The other two diners ordered grilled shrimp and fried cken.  The  grilled shrimp had good spices and flavor.   The fried had tasty breading.

Service was excellent!  Our beverages were never empty!

I am anxious to return to try other selections!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Wanted to try out a new spot around my area was definitely unimpressed. Went in with 3 other friends and ordered our food to go. When we got home and opened it up to eat it everything was wrong. One of ours was completely different from what he ordered and the other forgot his cobbler that he paid seperate for. I ordered the chicken and waffles and it didn't even have any chicken in it. We went back to get our orders fixed and came in to a waitress with an attitude who didnt feel the need to try to help out. After standing there for a second another customer in the store said his name was the same as my friends and come to find out the completely wrong order that went all the way back to our house and all of us ate because we were hungry in the first place they tried to give to him as if that was his fresh order. If we didn't say anything to him he would have taken it! After that we sat there for another 15 mins and when the food that she brought us out to replace sat behind her for a good five mins and she never brought it out. Not even any attempt to make up for their mistakes either with something for free our anything at all, just attitude. And apparently their manager \"doesn't work there.\" All in all none of our food was good and if it was it wasn't by the time we got to it because we had to wait so long. Got a floppy waffle and some mediocre chicken AND missed the first quarter of the Packers game. Don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible... and the tables were not cleaned all around bad experience"}
{"text":"It's a good thing that EllaEm's is a thousand miles away. If they were close to me, I'd be 400 pounds in no time! 

We were vacationing in Vegas and, being the consummate Queen of Bargains, I had found a Groupon Now for EllaEms. After checking Yelp, I thought it was worth a chance.  

My fellow Yelpers did not let me down.  Even though EllaEm's is in a strip  mall, we found it to be comfortable, welcoming and the food was great.  There is a sense of family and tradition.  I like that!

My man-folk had been disappointed that he hadn't had black eyed peas for New Years (not a tradition I was familiar with) so I was happy to tell him about the catfish and selection of sides.  

It was out of the way for tourists like us but with GPS, we found our way.  The young man working was attentive and courteous. Between the fried chicken, meatloaf or ribs, I couldn't decide what I wanted. I asked his opinion and said that his fave was the chicken. 

I went with the chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, mac and cheese and potato salad.  The man-folk ordered the catfish, black eyed peas, collard greens and veggies, I think.  

Not only was he happy, but I loved my dinner. The chicken was the best I have ever had. The sides were all delicious too.  The cost (even if I didn't have a Groupon) was very reasonable and the sizes were generous.

Vegas is lucky to have EllaEms. I'm going to add them to my list things to do when I return.  

Yum!!"}
{"text":"Southern fried chicken, Mac And Cheese, Yams collard greens on one plate and Cat Fish, black eyed peas, red beans and rice and cornbread dressings.   Ok let's start with the crunchy hot fried chicken very tasty but a little heavy on the salt.   Mac and Cheese was yummy. Collards was good but heavy on season and yams were right on point.  Cat Fish nice and hot seasoned great.  Black eyed peas was yummy. Red Beans and rice was ok kind of bland and the cornbread dressing not to my liking."}
{"text":"I was told about fifteen minutes for my order to be ready, but I've been waiting for ten minutes past the quoted time for French fries!"}
{"text":"Great service foods good prices are good too! I had the potato salad red beans and rice but my fav was the fried okra and the cabbage!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere very welcoming felt like home. Food was fresh cooked to order. Seasoned well, I enjoyed eating here would go back. Next I plan to bring my family so they can enjoy as much as I did. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because, my waffle was cold I felt like it could have been cooked a little longer."}
{"text":"Started with cornbread that was awesome.  Food was hot  and delicious. Fried Okra was the best I've had in years."}
{"text":"Great service.  Food was great and the restaurant is nice and clean.   I  had the pork chops and boy were they good!  The serving size was enough for lunch and dinner.  

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Some of the best soul food I've ever had! The. Catfish was seasoned so well and the fries were just right. The homemade lemonade had too much sugar for me but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Did the cook come back yet. We walked into a big disorganized mess. I'm not sure who was back there cooking. The orders were coming out cold and wait time was long. No dine in was available."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. They didn't have the dessert they advertised. I asked for catfish dinner and received catfish greasy nuggets or something. I tried it twice to make sure however both times it was terrible. I will never go back"}
