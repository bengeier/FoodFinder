{"text":"Just stopped in here & tried bacon egg & cheddar maffle, choc chip muffin, both amazing, don't know what they put in the waffles but the unique flavor makes them even better"}
{"text":"Tried to order through Yelp.  Delivery called me twice saying they could not reach the restaurant.  Not likely to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"I live in Texas; and I ordered Perfect Package 1; it was awesome!  Here's the deal; a lot of places ship you food you have to prepare....It is lovely to come home open a box of prepared food; all you have to do is reheat and done.  The beauty of it is I have future dinners for in the week; I just put in my fridge!  Already cooked; so if I need an office lunch...done.  If I need a meal for that evening...done.  The great thing about it is I am not doing the junk food thing; a good home cooked meal....that I didn't have to home cook...just home eat it if I wanted!"}
