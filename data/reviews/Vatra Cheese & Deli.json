{"text":"I'm not east European but I know the flavour and texture of fresh tasty food. My daughter asked for everything and since I was in no mood to argue I got one of everything. The fish fillet was our favourite followed by the fried bread filled with ground pork. Between us and dad, everything was consumed in 20 minutes. Since I'm pregnant, I'm picky about what I want and all of the items were edible and enjoyable."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this fancy little cheese shop and always seem to walk away with much more than I originally came for. I've been back a few times since, but during my first visit the guy who helped us out was very friendly and helpful with any questions we had. We ended up getting a few different kinds of cheese which were all fantastically gourmet and delicious. Before we left the owner even gave us a free sample of the fresh perogies they have as a warm lunch option.   It was definitely the best damn perogie I have ever tasted... lucky for me they also sell frozen packages of their homemade perogies. I grabbed a couple and made them at home and was not disappointed. I don't see myself eating any other perogies from now on.   A must try if you love good cheese, good food and good service!"}
{"text":"I come to Vatra usually before Easter and Xmas to buy some delis. This store IMHO is the best in GTA for European meats, candies, cheeses, canned vegetables, and bakery. I recommend it to everyone who loves European foods. Some products they carry I could not find anywhere else in GTA. The prices are a little high, but they justify the quality of the product you buy. I've been the customer of this store since it started its business."}
