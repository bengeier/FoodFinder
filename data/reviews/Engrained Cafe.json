{"text":"I've eaten at Engrained twice. We like to call it, lovingly, \"the frou-frou restaurant at the ASU MU.\" Any place that has the words Pithivier, Quinoa, Frangipane, Kalamata Tapenade, and Wilcox Flavorina Tomato on their menu, all at the same time, has frou-frou written all over it. Engrained claims to be a \"living-learning restaurant committed to locally grown food and environmentally friendly practices.\" Eh, whatever. So far, it all tastes good, or else I wouldn't bother yelping...

The first time I ate at Engrained, I partook of the prawn spring rolls with a peanut sauce. I have to assume that someone in Arizona is growing prawn in a vat, but that's cool. It was really, really good! 


Today I enjoyed, and I quote, \"Lamb and Feta Patties with Cucumber Tzatziki Parsnip and Potato Puree\" for $10.95. The meal comes with a drink (soda, tea, coffee), so that's really not a bad value for what you are getting. The meal consisted of one good-sized lamb patty with feta cheese mushed into the patty, on top of a yummy mashed potato base with a few string beans and cherry tomatoes. I think there was actually a pesto sauce on the top of the tzatziki, and it sure was delicious!! Portion size always seems adequate, without being overwhelming - a nice change from chain restaurants.

I haven't tried the sushi bar yet... Sushi \"grown\" in Arizona? Hmmm...

Anyway, do give Engrained a try, and try to guess what part of Arizona your food came from! : )"}
{"text":"I went with my roommates and was glad they accepted m&g. Unfortunate that the paninis cannot be modified. Pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has serious racial discrimination. Staff there have been very rude and gave personal insult based on false ground."}
{"text":"Note: they cut back on hours and now are ONLY open lunch 11 a.m.-1 p.m. M-F. Closed during semester breaks, they're opening up next on June 1. 

Not at all what you'd expect from on-campus dining, this space features sustainability in its construction, practices and menu offerings. The way it works is you get a assigned a table number, then you browse the food prepared that day at the various stations--pizza, entr√©es, sandwiches, etc.--and finally you order at the register.

Since you order first and tips aren't really part of the set-up, you won't get super personal service. But the food is really fresh and healthy/yummy and you'll feel good knowing they're making a conscious effort to not be wasteful. This past semester's menu featured sustainably harvested desert sweet shrimp and locally harvest citrus and dates. Good value for your price, ranging from $6-$20 depending on ingredients. Your meal purchase includes any drink; I recommend the prickly pear iced tea."}
{"text":"I went to an Infant Mental Health training at ASU on Friday.  At the lunch break, the instructor suggested Engrained at the Memorial Union.  I went to graduate school on the Tempe campus last year, and I'm so bummed that I didn't know about Engrained then.  They really need a higher profile.
The pros: they use locally-sourced ingredients in a creative manner.  The menu offered several entrees built around Maya's Farm veggies.  My quesedilla of grilled asparagus with a cilantro lime cream sause was fantastic.  My friend said her panini and salad was really good, too.  It's nice to be able to look at the food before ordering it.  The seating is comfortable and the employees were friendly.  In spite of the confusing system, our food was delivered to our table very promptly.
The cons: the ordering system is confusing, as others had mentioned.  I asked about it at the station where we got our table number, but still made the mistake of trying to order at the wrong place.  And it's on the ASU campus.  Parking is a nightmare; I took the light rail the day of my visit.  I'll probably rarely get to eat here, but I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Want a soggy 'panini' for $11.00? This is overpriced dining hall food.... Much better options in the area. It's a shame they waste such a nice space with dressed up Aramark food."}
{"text":"Good-to-great food, plus (non-alcoholic) drinks are included.  There are always specials with variations (e.g. vegetarian), and the ingredients are fresh.  Although \"slow food\" is, by definition, not rapidly prepared, sometimes the prep time is excessively slow for simple dishes.  Those who work the registers should warn people if it's going to take over 45 minutes to bring a garden salad or grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Mediterranean salad is fantastic. Fast and friendly service. Not too pricy ( approx $11) for the quality, convenience, and serving size (couldn't finish) considering you're eating downtown.. let alone on the ASU campus. Unlimited self-serve cucumber water and iced tea for dine-in. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I look forward to my visits to ASU and always make a point to eat at Engrained! Delicious, beautifully prepared healthy dishes in a timely manner with reasonable prices! Love all of the vegan options!!"}
{"text":"After three years of eating cheap junk food in the Memorial Union, I finally found a place on-campus that offers a pleasant environment as well as a great variety of delicious options for a reasonable price. As a student who spends long gruesome days on campus, this place is amazing when craving something nice while not wanting to commute off campus. 

The setup of this place is a little different that most restaurant. You walk in, look at the food that is either listed on the TVs by the pay counters or look at the sample presentations by the kitchen, go back to counter to order and pay for the food, and then proceed to sit down. 
It was relatively inexpensive, especially considering the quality, portions, and the beverages and a side that was included in the price. A few minutes after sitting at our table, a server brought our food to us. 

I had the Lamb Kofta with Couscous Salad. The portion was big enough to last me lunch and dinner if I hadn't eaten breakfast in the morning. Naan was provided with the salad. The plump baby tomatoes were juicy and sweet! The chicken was really tender and flavorful and the basil dressing was the perfect touch. My friend had the roasted pork which she said was soft and cooked to perfection! 

For dessert we had the S'mores tart after taking forever to decide because all the options looked appetizing. Everything was just right and the graham cracker base was more than yummm! 

Our bill was about $25 for the entrees and the dessert, which is not to bad at all. I don't mind paying a little more for quality and presentation and environment. Complementary drinks (fountain soda, green tea, black tea, infused water etc.) and freshly made seasoned potato chips added to the positive experience that we had. Ever since our first visit, my friend has returned every week. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I remember visiting Engrained a few times the first semester it opened, but each experience was so disappointing (incompetent staff, slow service, mediocre overpriced food) that I never went back. Today was my first time back and what a pleasant surprise! The trio was the perfect light lunch with fresh, well prepared ingredients and the service was efficient. And the price point was just right for a regular indulgence in a poor college foodie's budget. 

3 stars because the quality of all the dishes is still spotty. The grilled cheese and soup combo, another inexpensive option, sometimes has burnt sandwiches, or just poorly constructed greasy sandwiches in general."}
{"text":"Semi-healthy food which is a nice option to have at school on campus at ASU. I think the ordering system is a little hectic. I wish the waiters would explain more when you enter in about how their system works. As a first timer here, I was overwhelmed and wasn't sure what to do or where to order. The food was okay. The burger wasn't anything too special. The potatoes chips are great. The fries were mediocre. Overall, I would come here again. I just wish the staff were trained a little better."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, it's a shame more people don't know about this place. Staff is friendly. It's clean, spacious and their concept of being a sustainable restaurant is something to get behind!"}
{"text":"This place just opened at the start of 2018, I believe, at ASU downtown in the law school. It is a little bit of a pricier option for lunch on campus  with most entrees being over ten dollars. They have free ice tea if you dine-in though, as well as basil and cucumber infused water. They have a nice space with a very high ceiling. I was greeted warmly and asked if I wanted to dine in or take out. I dined in which if you do you get a number with an assigned table. You then take your number to the serving area where they have example plates made up of the entrees so you can see what you are going to be getting.  You then make your selection and then your meal is brought to your numbered table.

The wait for my food wasn't very long. I ordered the bison sliders which came with three sliders and a side house salad. The salad was nice with a variety of greens and a nice vinaigrette. The sliders were also yummy. My only complaint about then is that I wished they were a bit hotter, but I ate all my salad first so for a fast eater that may not be a problem. The bison was  good with nice cheddar and a roasted red pepper on top. The buns were just the right combination of flaky on the outside and soft on the inside. I wouldn't go here daily as a student but for a nice occasional meal when in the area this is a good choice and another close my option for people downtown."}
{"text":"This lunch meal was amazing and very affordable. I mean it's poke for $13. That's how much a standard sushi roll cost. BONUS: the meal includes ice tea or infused water. I also tried the salmon it's a very light meal with quinoa as the base (no photo sorry). I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Walking in, I loved the ambiance, Engrained is super cute and trendy, but once we got to the counter, to get our number, I was so confused. I came with some friends, and the ordering system was incredibly odd. There is an area where they have the entire menu, set out behind a counter to see what you would like. I think that being able to see your food was cool, but service was off, like they were done with the college crowd and I felt out of place. Maybe it is because I am new to ASU."}
{"text":"Engrained Caf√© is a really good option for on-campus dining. The food there is had a much higher quality than you would find at any other dining hall on campus. The menu is seasonal however. They don't have the widest variety of options and some of their menu items are hit-and-miss. I have gotten their Sushi bowl and their Peruvian chicken and I was very much pleased with the portions and the flavor of each of the dishes. While the chicken could use a little more seasoning and their chips are oftentimes dry or burnt , I would definitely recommend this restaurant for those who want to eat at a restaurant on campus. They do accept m&g."}
{"text":"I LOVE their Salmon. Love. It is nice to go to and use M&G, but if I had to spend real money, I wouldn't go as often. The food is pretty good and they rotate the menu frequently. I usually get the salmon, panini, or pasta dishes. The grass fed burger is good too, but you might want to try telling them to not cook it as much! They tend to cook more well done by default it seems."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really cool, especially for an on-campus restaurant! I don't think I've ever been to an on-campus restaurant that actually brings the food to your table. It's also really cool that they use locally sourced ingredients. I will say that the options on the day I visited didn't really \"speak\" to me...but I ordered teriyaki glazed salmon with fried rice and still managed to clean my plate. I think that, for a college campus (where, presumably, students are trying to eat healthy) some nutrition facts about the food would be a good addition. I've seen that at other college campuses and it can be helpful. Otherwise, nice job to ASU for a creative spin on campus dining."}
{"text":"It's my second time eating here and I definitely loved it both times. Being the snobby vegan brat that I am, there's little to nothing to eat on campus but this place is really delicious and has well prepared and a diverse variety of options."}
{"text":"Such an eatery gem on the ASU campus. SO many delicious and allergy-friendly options. My friend and I split three dishes because we couldn't decide on just one.

The poke bowl and veggie sushi were or favorites. Clean and savory tasting with decent plating made for some happy bellies. The hummus was just okay, and the plating was a little lackluster but we wouldn't complain (just hard to stack up next to our other dishes). The apple creme br√ªl√©e dessert was nice. Kinda bread like (bread pudding ish) and not overly sweet, but tasty.

The complementary drink and potato chips are such a great touch. Put our group of six in such a jolly mood before the food was even served. 

Can't wait to come back! Also, beware of the birds who you will eat your food if no one is at the table!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars for food. The attention to healthy, locally-sourced food is great. I love that they inform you which allergens are in which meals! And the taste is pretty darn good too!

5 stars for most service. The waitstaff are incredibly nice and the cashiers are always really accommodating when it comes to allergens and stuff. I really appreciate that!

-100 stars for the hostess. I don't like confrontation, and there aren't a ton of places I can eat on ASU's campus, but I shy away from this place because that lady is a difficult, sour, mean mean mean woman. I don't know if it's because I'm a woman (which makes it inappropriate), because I often attend with minority (female) graduate students (which makes it inappropriate), because I and those I attend with are often young (which makes it inappropriate), or if there's no deport reason whatsoever which makes it inappropriate), but her behavior toward us is nearing harassment---and I don't take that stance lightly! (Examples: My white male colleagues easily walked past her and into the restaurant after using the bathroom outside the restaurant; when my female colleague and I did, she stepped in front of us and said, \"Stop, ladies\", indicating we needed to check with her before we could enter or even walk through the restaurant. A white male colleague and a white female colleague each had an opaque water bottle with them; she came over to ensure that the female's container had water in it and not an outside beverage. A male colleague ate his homemade sandwich with our group during a meeting, all without incident; I ordered a salad without the topping--basically a plate of lettuce, which I guess could have made it look like I was eating food from home--and she came over to tell me that outside food wasn't allowed.)"}
{"text":"We were looking for a vegan friendly place near the ballpark. This fit the bill perfectly. It provides a combination of entr√©es that worked perfectly for my husband Who prefers more traditional food and for me. Tacos made with chorizo soy were wonderful and my husband's salmon was cooked perfectly. Their menu items include caloric content which is an additional plus. Friendly staff and food is primarily sourced locally. Plus for those interested there is a full bar."}
{"text":"I've been an ASU employee for ages and eat here a couple of times a month. I've never, ever had a bad meal. In fact the meals are fresh, unique and for the most part very healthy. 

I'm not a salmon fan at all, but because I'm trying to eat more healthfully, I ordered the salmon, veggies and fingerling potatoes yesterday So delicious and filling. My only issue is that the fish was cooked with lots of oil. Of course my food was awesome but as a Weight Watcher, I should have asked how the fish was cooked. My bad. 

They typically have burgers, pizza, and a gluten free meal option. And oh!  They have sushi too. 

Don't be thrown off by how you're seated and how you order. Just do this:
Walk up to the desk and give them your party count. You'll get a table number.  Overhead you will see the day's menu. 
Next walk over to the prep area where you can get a visual of the food for portion size, ingredients, etc. 
Don't dawdle! Head to the registers to actually place your order. Show your table number. All members of your party will use the same number. 
Get a drink and find your table. Easy peasy, right? 

What I like most about engrained is that beverages are included and the servers bring you a bowl of tasty chips as you wait for your meal. 

If you're visiting ASU this is THE place to have lunch on campus. Trust me. You can relax and decompress. The place does get a bit crowded by noon so try to get there early. 

Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but not worth the money. The ordering system was a bit weird. Free drinks though and brownie points for cucumber water! Also very nice outdoor seating area and clean indoor area.

I got the mushroom stroganoff. The taste was a bit bland and the pasta was slightly overcooked. Honestly I think I can cook better pasta dish. And for $10? No way... Also for my friend's burger, the beef was 100% done. They didn't even ask how it wanted to be cooked. My other friend's Asian noodles were subpar. Food was just okay here. 

The ordering system was what confused me. It looks like you can order food at where they're making the food because there's display and glass dividers, just like a deli section. So I was walking around and getting ready to place my order. Then I was told I actually have to order it at the cash register, which by the way had a slow a long line. Alright, that's weird. Then what's the point of the big area where you can walk and browse? Why don't just make a bigger kitchen at the back and fence it away like Panera Bread? After ordering and paying at the cash register, they give you a number for you to display at your table, just like Panera Bread. Hm... Not the most efficient and space-maximizing way to run a canteen. 

However, I gotta say I'm impressed with the cucumber water! That's exactly what I needed in the Arizona heat!

I don't think it's worth the price they charge for the food they serve."}
{"text":"A hidden gem on ASU's Tempe campus. It's located on the second floor of the Memorial Union and offers booth, bar, table, and outdoor seating. It has very limited hours (11 a.m. - 3 p.m. on weekdays, I believe), but is definitely very busy while its doors are open. All of the food is made with fresh and locally-sourced ingredients, and there's always a number of vegan and gluten-free options. The menu changes frequently, so every time I go, I try to order something different or seasonal, knowing that it might not be offered the next time I return. Sometimes service can be spotty, but for the most part, it's good. Make sure to grab some complementary chips or coffee while you wait for your order!"}
{"text":"I ate here while on a visit to ASU. I was incredibly impressed by the decor and the food at this cafe. I wish we had something like this where I work! 

The food was amazing and fresh. It's absolutely beautiful to look at. I had the sweet potato soup with a Cesar salad. Engrained has many options for vegetarians and vegans. The soup I ordered was vegan, and one of the employees offered me a sample when they saw me eyeing it. This was great because I wasn't sure if I would like the soup or not, but I loved it and made sure to get it. If you are unsure about something, be sure to ask for a sample. I'm not sure that it works for everything, but it does for the soup.

When I checked out, the cashier asked me if I wanted chicken in my salad. I said no, I would prefer not to have it. She responded by saying it came that way (I ordered it anyways). Then she did the same thing to the person behind me. What's the point of asking people if they want chicken if the answer is going to be that the salad comes with it? I prefer not to eat meat so I just worked around the chicken - no big deal.

The food came out in a timely manner and was just delightful. It was very fresh and had lots of flavor. If I worked at ASU I would be in this cafe as much as possible for lunch. You can get a good meal for a good price (10.00 or so I believe) and get something that is delicious and nutritious. 

Employees were very nice and professional."}
{"text":"So, I am writing this review as a current graduate student, alumni and university employee. I very much have enjoyed my meals at Engrained. In fact, it is was of our favorite lunch places to have meetings at. They have a good range of options for every palate. Their quinoa options tend to be my favorites. Worth trying if you need a break from all the commercial spots."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place for lunch in all of Tempe! The food is delicious, the space is huge and welcoming, and the service is great.

We had the blackened fish tacos, a crab salad (that had arugula and rice), a cheese pizza that was delicious with cheese made from a local Arizona company, and a dessert.

The chips are complimentary and they have flavored waters like cucumber water or orange water."}
{"text":"Love their food! Love that they have vegan options and it's healthy tasty food . Everyone's always so nice and attentive"}
{"text":"I could spend this review harping on all the others who unfairly compare Engrained to a five-star restaurant, but I'd rather focus on the fact that Engrained is of such a caliber that people are even able to confuse the two. Keep in mind that this caf√© is essentially a school cafeteria that happens to cater to outside guests. 

When Engrained first opened, I was thrilled. I spent almost every spare cent I had enjoying lunch there twice a week. The restaurant is built in the spot where a previous caf√© had burnt down, and follows in the footsteps of Arizona State's sustainability initiative. At first, it was incredibly slow, but three years later and there are almost never enough tables to seat everyone who shows up for lunch. Yes, the ordering system is a bit archaic, but I like the freedom it affords me to browse (and, also, not to tip). Hint: tell the hostess you'll be eating outside, place your order at the sushi station to avoid lines and head out onto the beautiful Starlight Terrace to seat yourself. 

Although I am not affiliated with the business, I have dined there so often that I have come to be on a first-name basis with both the original Assistant Chef, Chadwick, and the new one, John, as well as some of the waiters. You will also see the manager and owner here on an almost daily basis. It's very obvious that the people who work here care about what they're doing. The food staff has always been kind to me, and are very knowledgeable about the items they're serving.  The other day I had a side salad and was absolutely thrilled to notice fresh, nutty fiddleheads in the mix. When I enquired, the Head Chef, Jerome, told me they had been sourced from Sonoma Valley.

Engrained used to advertise it's menu as all from within 200 miles of Arizona State. I'm sure their customers caught on that they weren't locally sourcing ahi tuna, but that doesn't detract from Engrained's sustainable and green practices. They use real plates and silverware, recycled napkins, fair trade coffee and the restaurant itself is built out of renewable resources such as bamboo. In addition, they observe sustainable seafood practices, use cage-free eggs and free-range beef. Food is sourced locally when possible, from valley locales such as Queen Creek Olives, Shamrock Farms and, most notably, right from the ASU campus. I have personally eaten dishes made with the campus' Seville oranges, dates and lemonquats. 

The menu changes on a rough two-week schedule, but always includes a few staples such as artisan pizza, paninis, quesadillas and a burger. There are also salads, soups, sushi and dessert to choose from, as well as the \"Engrained Trio,\" a small sampling of a salad, entre√© and dessert for $7. 

Menu items run the gamut from pork loin with peach chutney paninis to chicken scallopini to eggplant ragout, and everything in between. Prices can be steep (from $5 - $15), but it's not too difficult to find something delicious and affordable here. 

Overall, Engrained is a restaurant that offers an amazingly healthy and high-caliber alternative to other campus dining establishments. It has come a long, long way since it first opened it's doors. The restaurant is always seeking to do better, often holding seminars for staff and students alike, as well as participating in numerous other community events, such as the farmer's market on campus. On a number of occasions I have written suggestions on the comment cards and later been personally approached by either a chef or the manager, telling me they had appreciated and would be considering my suggestions. 

I would recommend that anyone in the area try Engrained at least once, keeping an open mind and remembering what a noble cause this restaurant is striving for on a campus where a Big Mac and Frappuccino qualify as \"lunch\""}
{"text":"Went here on a whim today to try it out and I was pleasantly surprised. The layout is kind of confusing at first, but once you figure it out it's pretty easy. Their menu has a pretty decent variety of pizza, burgers, sushi and salads/hummus. I would have liked a little more choice as far as the menu is concerned though. Service was pretty standard. You pay at the counter and then they bring your food out to you, which was done pretty fast. 

I ordered the tootsie roll and some fries and my girlfriend got the pepperoni pizza with a side of fries. Drinks/chips were included but we didn't try the chips. The roll was somewhat small but it tasted pretty good. My girlfriend's pizza was really good, I was pretty jealous. We both enjoyed the hand cut fries a lot. 

Overall I'd say it was a good experience. Adding a little more to the menu would go a long way I think. I will be back to try their burger. The table next to us got one and it looked really good."}
{"text":"I applaud ASU's attempt to bring healthy dining options to the downtown campus. As a vegan, it's usually Bowl of Greens or walking a few blocks off campus for other decent vegan options (especially now that Fair Trade closed down). I was very happy to see Engrained open on the ground floor of the law school.

The menu at Engrained is creative and has something for everyone. As a vegan, I was excited to see at least two options for me - in particular the vegan chorizo tacos and the baked tofu bowl. I went with the tacos because, well, tacos. They were served quickly and looked nice. However, once I dug into them, I discovered that what was inside wasn't what I would consider vegan chorizo. It was a black bean chipotle burger split into three small soft tacos that included raw cabbage and pico, with chipotle aioli (which I really hope was vegan, but I had it on the side just to be safe). It tasted fine, but really wasn't what I had expected to get. If I wanted a bean burger, I would have ordered a bean burger. The cost was also an issue - $11 for three small \"tacos\" seemed rather high. But, the meals come with free iced tea, so that's good.

I'm sure I'll be back again to try other vegan options, but my first visit was somewhat of a disappointment. The service was outstanding, and the other items I saw being delivered to diners looked great - especially the salads. I just won't be getting the tacos again unless they change the ingredients to match the description."}
{"text":"This place is great! Located conveniently on in ASU's Memorial Union, students and community members alike can enjoy fresh and healthy options right on campus. Engrained has a seasonal rotating menu that always seem to feature new and local food. It's definitely one of the fanciest restaurants you will find on a college campus, but it's definitely worth it in my opinion if you are ready to switch things up. For those of you who still have Maroon & Gold dollars, I am happy to report that Engrained will accept M&G!

The menu has everything from freshly made pizza to sushi, and it is focused on fresh ingredients and sustainable sourcing. Come here with an open mind and you will be blown away with some of the adventurous offerings. I love trying new things, and I can always trust Engrained to have some enticing menu options. 

If you want a healthy alternative to the other fast food options here on campus, I highly recommend this place. You will sometimes find ASU faculty and staff treating VIP guests to lunch here, and I have been lucky enough to be a part of a couple of those events. If you find yourself on ASU's campus, you will not regret checking this cafe out."}
{"text":"Just tried it.  Loved having a Vegan option, food was super tasty, well presented albeit a bit on the pricey side so I worry about its long term viability in a college area - but I hope it survives as I'm a fan."}
{"text":"For on-campus food, this place is not bad. I had their seafood gumbo and tootsie sushi roll. The gumbo was decent, but not great. The sushi was mediocre at best and very dry."}
{"text":"It's sometimes hit or miss. I enjoy the trio because you get a couple things for a decent price and it's not super filling. Sometimes its not filling enough though. Other items are good and the options vary. Sushi is pretty good too. Service is ok. They are nice but sometimes a little eager to clean up and have tried taking my plate before I finish. The atmosphere is nice. Even when it's busy in the middle of lunch it's still better than dealing with the madness in the MU. 3 stars for food and service but 4 because yes I'll admit I'm a fan and do look forward to when I get the chance to eat here."}
{"text":"Wow, wished I found this place earlier before I flushed all my M and G at the decidedly sub par fast food chains in the Memorial Union. This place is a diamond in the rough especially for students like me subsiding mostly on Subway.

My seared Ahi salad was interesting and well executed and had elements of beets, turnips, and quinoa in a romaine salad.

Its a tad pricey but I'm willing to pay for quality when I get free drinks and a restaurant style setting once in a while. (Especially if I'm using Maroon and Gold)
The ambiance is also 10x better then what you see at the other on campus restaurants.

For people complaining about service try Hassy, PV, or even the esteemed Barrett dining halls =/ The service here is golden and lightning fast compared to that.

That said returning as a non-student in the future is close to nil as I hope to have found better options but for now this is truly an ASU treasure and one I will frequent."}
{"text":"As an ASU student I had a heard about the opening of Engrained last year and tried it at the reccomendation of a friend. They give you a number which corresponds to a table at which you sit. You can walk around and look at the foods they have on the menu for the day (which I think is so cool and eliminates the \"wow this is not what I thought I was ordering\" moments). All the foods they serve are locally grown (I'm assuming minus the fish for sushi...) which is nice and every meal comes with a refillable drink. Items I've had here include a pineapple teriyaki burger, steak melt sandwich, and pesto chicken panini. Sometimes they serve things that are kind of \"overdone\" with fancy ingredients that no one knows what they are but there's always something on the daily menu that looks delicious. In terms of price I've paid anywhere between $6 and $10 but when you consider the drink included that's not so bad. If you're on or near campus and looking for something different, give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is a very fresh and healthy place to eat on campus! Everything is made with fresh local produce and there are numerous gluten free, vegan and organic options. A nice break from all the greasy food on campus! Try the vegetable fried rice or the grilled chicken with the tomato salad. They also have great dessert - organic chocolate cake with strawberries!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite dinning place in the Memorial Union. The food is very fresh and delicious. However, as a student, it's hard to eat here everyday. Compared with those fast food chains in the MU, Engrained provides good quality food with higer price. Overall, clean environment, friendly staff, i will def. go there again..."}
{"text":"Engrained has made a few good dishes in their time. I was really let down though when, after inquiring about why they stopped labelling vegan options, I got an e-mail directly from the chef in which he told me that vegans are only a small part of the campus population (1%). Well, I already knew this, I have no delusions of a vegan majority, so it just came across as insulting. If you send a question to a restaurant because you have a peanut allergy and the response starts with \"most of our customers don't have peanut allergies\", how would you feel? What if you keep kosher or halal and the chef tells you \"most of our customers are Christians\"? Obviously veganism and allergies and religion are different, but it's never a good idea to essentially tell a customer their concerns aren't important because they're in the minority. Also, the food was never worth the prices and probably never will be, food takes forever to arrive even for simple dishes, the ordering system is bizarre and they are often out of menu items. Their hours are also really frustrating."}
{"text":"This place is okay. The service is really great and the location is very convenient. However, the food is mediocre at best and the options are a little strange. It is also very expensive. ---Additionally, who doesn't offer fries/chips with a burger or sandwich?"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we ate here (but we're going back again tomorrow). I think we had the Gazpacho, a Desert Sweet Shrimp Pasta dish and something with butternut squash and gnocchi. The Gazpacho badly needed salt, the shrimp pasta was a little on the bland side (just a little) but the butternut squash dish was phenomenal! We thought it was strange at first that you walk around and look at the food then walk up to the register to order, but it turned out OK because it's kind of nice to see what your food will look like when it comes out. 

The interior of the restaurant is beautiful too. Lots of bamboo paneling and everything is supposed to be sustainable. A side note: they don't have high chairs or boosters (a big problem for college students, I know, so if you have a little one, bring your own booster seat if you need one).  Most people won't have this problem but I travel with a two year old.  That's just how I roll."}
{"text":"I finally made it over to Engrained and I was pleasantly surprised at how great everything tasted. Fresh, healthy, organic, and vegan-friendly eats in the middle of a college campus.

I ordered the Vegan Pakora Platter - $10.75. It came with 4 pieces of pakora, saffron wild rice, and a chickpea & cucumber salad with mixed greens. (It also comes with tomatoes, but I omitted them.) Everything was so flavorful. This is a far cry from the boring campus food from my university days.  I considered this to be a large and filling portion. 

I got a side of their Seasoned Fries - $2.75.  I loved the seasoning and the fries were light & crispy.

I also tried the Peach Rhubarb Crisp - $4. It was good, but next time I'll skip the Vanilla Bean Meringue that came on the side, which seemed to give it a sour taste. 

A drink is included with any purchase, which was a nice surprise.

I love how many vegan options they have! There is at least one vegan option in each menu categories. For pizza lovers, they offer vegan cheese upon request; veggie burgers are also available upon request.  There are lots of gluten-free options as well.  

This cafe is pretty large and has ample seating for large groups. For wifi, connect to ASU's free guest connection (you'll need to register if you don't already have an account). 

As a campus cafe, they are only open 11am-3pm, M-F, so be sure to get your fix before the weekend.

I was very pleased with my meal at Engrained and I'm looking forward to trying more of their culinary creations."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a student at ASU and treated me to the delight that is Engrained.  He had a bouillabaisse-type cod dish, and I had the portobellini raviolis with local ricotta.  Both dishes were fantastic, but the ravioli was particularly great -- the sauce was light and creamy, and the raviolis were perfectly chewy without being mushy.  

We also split a dessert, some kind of pear bread pudding with whipped yummy nonsense.  Another win.

BONUS: They serve the same \"iced passion tea\" as Arcadia Farms."}
