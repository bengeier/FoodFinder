{"text":"In reading the other reviews on here, it's clear that there are some people who really love this place.  Not surprisingly none of them are Asian ... neither am I, but my partner is and we were at Sunluck Gardens together on the eve on which this review was based. 

I will say that we went there with minimal expectations, based on most other Cleveland area Chinese restaurants.  We arrived at approximately 7p on a Friday evening and found the place about 1/3 full.  It's the lone bit of life in an otherwise dismal and vacant strip mall.

The first thing we noted was the lack of Asians.  There were none in the dining room and none to be seen in the kitchen or wait staff.  Most of the clientele were older couples over the age of 50.  I can't fault the service; they were attentive and friendly.

Upon reviewing the menu, we weren't terribly impressed with the selection and we couldn't help but feel that everything was $2-3 more expensive than it should be, based on other Chinese restaurants in town.

With some trepidation, we ordered the kung pao beef, the garlic spicy eggplant, and the dark tofu with vegetables.

The general tone of everything we were served was sweetness.  There was way too much sugar being tossed around in that kitchen, and that was a theme I noticed from a number of the other reviews on here.  I like my food a little sweeter than my partner does, but even I felt like it was all just short of being a dessert.

The Kung Pao Been was mostly diced green beans; we ordered it at a medium spice level and could barely note even a tingle on the tongue.

The Garlic Spicy Eggplant was a brown mush with no discernible eggplant pieces - imagine babaganouj loaded with teryaki and hoisin.

The Dark Tofu with Vegetables - we weren't sure what \"dark tofu\" was but it was on the menu a few times and someone recommended it in a Yelp review - was not tofu at all.  It was gluten.  Now there's nothing wrong with gluten; it can be really tasty, and this may have been the best dish we ordered, but the pieces were minuscule and it was swamped with a sticky sweet brown sauce.

While we were eating, the owner - I'm guessing her name was Annie, based on other reviewers on here - came to our table and asked how we were doing.  She seemed very nice and recommended that if we took home any of the eggplant, that it went well as a spread for pita.  she was probably right, it would have been good on pita, but it certainly wasn't much of a dish by itself.

She stopped by a few other tables and some of the people obviously knew her.  An older couple sat down at a table next to us, and when they ordered they made a special request for some dish that wasn't on the menu - while I don't recall what the dish was exactly, I do remember them telling the waiter to \"ask Annie if she would make her special XYZ for us.\"  Shortly thereafter, Annie came back out of the kitchen and they conversed for a while.  It was great to see that sort of personal touch in a local restaurant, but I just wish the food was better.

While it pains me to give this place only two stars - it would have been 1 star but for the service - I just wouldn't feel comfortable sending anyone here who had any anticipation of even Americanized Chinese food.  

I wish Annie the best, but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wow.  Unbelievable.  Two adjectives that in some instances would denote exceptional and superb experience, but not in this visit, to say the very least.

 Went here for dinner tonight and had 6:30 reservations.  The smallish restaurant was packed to the gills, a rare occurrence is what I'm told by relatives that accompanied us (they'd never seen more than two tables occupied).  Apparently, it was spicy mussel night that they hold every now and then and pulls in a packed house.  I know, seemed strange to me too.  Ordered a vegetable egg roll appetizer and the plates and sauces were brought out about 10 minutes later.  No kidding, 30 minutes later the egg roll had yet to materialize.  When we flagged down the waiter to see what was going on since they had brought out the sauces but not the egg roll, he condescendingly told us that sauces are ready, but the egg roll takes time to cook, you see!  When the time-consuming egg roll finally arrives, I literally laughed out loud and turned a couple heads at the same time.  What arrived was the saddest presentation of a single, tasteless roll of grease.

  But wait, there are entrees too!  I ordered the kung pao shrimp and my wife got the yin yang tofu.  Don't know if the cook confused my order, but the kung pao came out tasting more of a sweet and sour with the emphasis on sweet.  The only vegetables were green beans and the occasional mushroom.  Unlike any kung pao I've ever had, so, for their sake let's hope they just made the wrong dish.  However, it had been an hour and 20 minute wait so I wasn't going to ask for something else.  The tofu dish was about as flavorless as plain tofu out of the container would be, and I'm pretty sure that's all it was.  The 'dark' part of the yin yang tofu turned out to be the mushiest seitan I've ever encountered.

Oh, but then the dinner theatre part of the night began!  At an adjoining table two geriatric couples were sitting and one of the gentlemen couldn't cope with having to wait so long for the shoddy service.  He made it clear to everyone around that this was the worst dinner he'd ever had and that when the check came he wasn't even going to tip 75 cents.  After an hour of his muttering, the table next to them (also occupied by a geriatric couple) decided it would be best for everyone in the restaurant to start talking back and a shouting match ensued, complete with awkward expletives.  Second old man actually gets up from his table and walks over to the other guy threatening to throw down if the first one didn't shut it and leave.  Kranky dude's wife finally gets him to back down and they quickly leave the restaurant, leaving the most awkward dinner-ending silence I've ever experienced.

Long story short, food is subpar.  Don't go here unless you get excited about the prospect of senior citizen fisticuffs."}
{"text":"Is there a finer Chinese restaurant in Cleveland? Absolutely  NOT!!.. categorically THE best. I have eaten there countless thousands of times and the food is always magnificent. Try the butternut squash soup for a real treat. If Annie is making pulled pork, have it!  I particularly love the shrimp lobster sauce and house fried rice (my newest passion for some reason). Try the fish with an asparagus or black bean sauce or the pineapple stir fry. I love this place. I love the servers. I love Annie. It's the best"}
{"text":"I was hoping for a better experience, but I was disappointed.  This is the second time I've gotten take-out.  The first time the food was okay.  This time only the egg roll was good.  The fried rice had an \"off\" taste - something not quite right - so I pitched it.  The Yu Shan pork was swimming in sauce and the broccoli was cooked until it was mushy and almost looked like it came out of  a can.   I won't order there again."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Everything was sweet. It's like cooking a steak marinated with sugar. If you have functional taste buds do not come here!"}
{"text":"the best service anywhere!  i will never forget my first time going when i was offered samples of sorbet and small cookies while waiting for my meal.  i am certain that annie, the owner, has a fleet of fans simply based on how inviting she is.  try anything with dark tofu!!  i love that she uses gigantic walnuts and green beans in some of the entrees,  a nice departure from the usual chinese food choices.  on a few occasions i have found sun luck to be closed, call ahead to be sure."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese restaurant in Cleveburg. 

Annie Chiu does all the traditional dishes, but it is the *dessert* that really stands out when you're least expecting it. The orange coconut cake and fried milk (not always on the menu) are incredible.

Also get on her email list: spicy green mussels, crab and other great dishes are not on the menu and you'll only know if you're on the list. 

Finally, she keeps a small amount of duck confit around (also not on menu) which she cooks in Chinese style.

Awesome place one of favorites in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The new owners of Sun Luck are working very hard to delight the restaurant's old customers.  We've been there 3 times now since Annie retired, and it's quickly becoming one of our local favorites.  Last night Yuan, one of the new owners,gave us complimentary bowls of  her version of butternut squash soup.  It was delicious!  I also had the eggplant in garlic sauce which is made from beautiful Chinese eggplant cooked perfectly.  Last time I was there, I had the green beans, and they were equally fresh, and delicious.  The portions are large and reasonably priced.  There was a brisk take-out business while we were there, but I was glad for the attentive and personable service that we were getting from Yuan. I highly recommend that you stop in and give it a try."}
{"text":"Most important: not a good sign if a Chinese restaurant is only filled with old white people.  Not one Asian person.

The waitstaff took so long, we waited for soup! for about 45 minutes, then about 30 past that for the main dishes.  We kept laughing because we thought the server and the bus boy were on drugs, but I guess they're  liked by people.  

The hot and sour soup (ordered with meat) had none and was the consistency of jello pudding (way too much cornstarch), the sizzling rice soup had no rice.  Medium hot was as spicy as bell peppers (none).

The ingredients were fresh tasting but the dishes really were light on the meat they were supposed to contain.

This place has potential but needs to be on the kitchen disaster show.  I hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"Wow.  I was really impressed by the service provided at this restaurant.  The waiter was a bit zany, but this added to the dining experience.

The food was really good, and satisfied my cravings.  The menu was also pretty extensive.

HOWEVER, I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because my plate was dirty (gross)."}
{"text":"Delicious!
I ordered carry out, the service was quick and friendly.  The restaurant looked clean and the atmosphere was quite pleasant.

I picked Sesame Chicken and Crab Rangoon.
I was able to get the chicken spicy, which was a pleasant surprise.  The server even said that any dish can be made with spice upon request.

I requested medium and it was more of a mild by my standards.  I still found it delicious, moist and tender.
The rice was cooked perfectly, sticky but not soggy

The Rangoon were folded into triangles, I prefer when they're folded into flower looking things for the extra crisp, but when I pulled apart the first one I immediately forgot about that preference.  They were stuffed with wonderful meat and light on the cream cheese, totally opposite of the norm.

I intend to return for a lovely dine in session next time around."}
{"text":"We have tried many Chinese restaurants in the Cleveland area, and Sun Luck Garden (I am referring to the new owner) is one of the best for sure. The ingredients they use are fresh; seasoning is properly balanced. Service is extremely conscientious. The waitress/owner (I suspect; she is always there) remembers what our preference is (no onions or scallions), even though we just go there occasionally. My absolute favorite is shrimp pan fried noodle with Chinese broccoli. We strongly recommend this restaurant. This is my first ever review of any restaurant; I just wanted to support this place because it seems to be underrated."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this restaurant since it was recommended by Michael Ruhlman. I lived in Japan for 5 years and traveled throughout South East Asia extensively; China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand and have enjoyed much authentic Chinese cuisine. I was underwhelmed by this restaurant. The food was ok, the decor was lacking and the service was so so."}
{"text":"So my parents are in town visiting this week and being Chinese, they prefer to eat Asian food in general. This place is right across the street from where I live, so, being new to the area as well, I suggest we try this place.
When we walk in, I immediately start to doubt my decision. Although most of the table are occupied, which is generally a good sign, they are all occupied by middle aged white American people. When we are greeted by a white college guy who is our server, I start to think of ways that we can get out of here without looking ridiculous.
Unfortunately, my dad convinces us to stay.

Oh I forgot to mention, my family is all vegetarian.
So they have quite a few vegetarian options, which is one of the reasons I wanted to go in the first place. 
My dad starts with the hot and sour soup, which he says is decent.
I have a veggie eggroll, which is pretty average.
We went on the have the Vegetarian Kung Pao, Vegetarian Hawphen, and Dark Tofu with Oriental Vegetables.
I don't even know where to begin. It's hard to say that they weren't authentic, because the dishes were very home style cooking. Like something you'd find in some small village where the mom doesn't know how to cook and just throws things together. The main problem with all the food was how ridiculously sweet everything was. It all just tasted like someone accidentally spilled a whole cup of sugar in it. There was definitely lots of MSG, which I'm fine with in small quantities, but some other people aren't.
Yeah it was like eating candy laced with MSG.

On another note, the service was quite good. The college boy was actually quite attentive, professional, and funny. An older Asian lady came out, presumably the owner or chef, and asked how everything was.

Overall, I'd come back here again if I were really desperate and lazy, because I could make the same caliber of food from here in my own kitchen. I had some good expectations because of the good reviews on here, but people's taste buds must be off because I don't understand how superb can be used to describe the food here and it is just sad if this is the best Chinese food some people have had :("}
{"text":"Since moving to the area, I've been extraordinarily loyal to the little Chinese place around the corner from my house.  However, the family that owned it recently retired, so when I craved Chinese the other day, I decided to try my luck and order from Sun Luck Garden via SkipTheDishes.

On the plus side, the combo fried rice was excellent, and I really liked the crab  rangoons.  On the downside, the General Tso's was disappointing.  Very sweet and sticky and not spicy at all, despite having requested it to be hot.

It was nice to have a delivery option, and maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, so it wasn't the worst experience in the world, but I'll probably go back to my regular spot from now on."}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant. The won ton soup was fresh, hot and delicious. The egg rolls same. Szechuan chicken was very good but not stellar. I've also tried the lemon chicken which was great. Mongolean beef is outstanding. Portions are big. Service was excellent. Immaculately clean. Fresh interiors. New owner. She is very nice. She is trying hard to make it a go after Annie left. Doing great. Business was slow when I went in. Her prices are very reasonable. They have family dinner specials on the back of the menu which includes full dinner, rice, tea, eggrolls, and soup. Dinner for 2 is about 18 bucks. Can't beat that. This is quickly becoming the best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland Heights and perhaps the east side IMO."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood  and decided to get some carry-out from Sun Luck, a restaurant we have enjoyed many times in the past.The young man who greeted us was friendly and helpful, and the owner, Annie, was making the rounds in the dining room...perhaps she should have been supervising the kitchen! The spring roll was fine  but the ribs were swimming in sauce and shards of bone could have been lethal. The lemon chicken was bland and devoid of lemon flavor and the pasty breading gave it a strange consistency. The Kung Pao Chicken, ordered medium spicy, was also bland and although full of chopped water chestnuts, there was NOT ONE PEANUT in the dish. We always look forward to the fortune cookies, and even they were missing from our bag. I don't think we'll be back...too bad, this used to be a gem in Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"Trying to become a vegetarian, a lazy one, but hey still, trying hard to stick to it. 
Ordered eggplant in garlic sauce and vegetable egg foo young. 
The fried eggplant and onions were drenched in oil. Half of the carry-out box was filled with clearly re-used dark brown oil. I could probably harvest a full cup of oil that's been used 3-4 times before. 
The egg foo young was a disgusting oily concoction of shredded veggies in over fried omelette form. Like they were actually so dark and burned and there was no taste of eggs in that dish. 
The only reason they're getting 2 stars is because the people were nice at the reception."}
{"text":"This little place is a top-notch restaurant, and in my opinion, is the best Chinese food one can obtain in the Cleveland area outside of Chinatown.  Although it serves a lot of the standard American-Chinese fare, it does it well, and it serves a number of items that venture into the realm of authenticity, including a few specials and random things that I have not ever seen elsewhere.  The menu is separated effectively into Szechuan, Mandarin, and Cantonese cuisine, which is a nice touch.

The quality?  It's consistently excellent.  The food is flavorful and balanced, made with fresh ingredients.  Everything here has a certain dash of novelty that makes this restaurant unique.  And it's very reasonably priced.

The service is always very good.  The people who work here (it's a small family business) are incredibly sweet.

This is one of my favorite restaurants on Cleveland's east-side and I think it is often overlooked and under-appreciated."}
{"text":"I hate to be the ones to break this to the rest of you yelpers... But the restaurant has changed hands and has a different menu. I went in craving the butternut squash wonton  soup and was shocked to see everything changed over. The food was still very very good- I will just miss Annie :/"}
{"text":"Don't be turned off by the strip mall location.  Go early, this is not a late place. But if you love locally owned, and a gourmet chef, don't hesitate to try this place.  Annie is a legend among Cleveland cooks.  This is a simple but very, very good restaurant. Older clientele who come here for the local flavor, chat with Annie, etc.  Want help with the order.... just ask her.  Service is mostly younger, but Annie is always running around organizing her small restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food, and reasonable prices.  A nice selection of dishes. I was getting a takeout order and wasn't sure what I wanted, the server actually sat down with me, poured me a drink and explained his suggestions. Probably the only time I ever wanted to leave a tip for a takeout order! The food was really good and I have been back several times since."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying customer service is everything. When it comes to pleasing customers they don't fall short a bit.

We tried the ham egg foo yung with fried rice, chicken lo mein, house fried rice, and egg rolls.
Everything was fresh and the taste was authentic. 
Chinese is my favorite and I could eat it everyday. However, the Chinese in my area has been falling short. I can't say the same about SunLuck and their NEW MANAGEMENT!

The restaurant was also very clean which is most important to me. 

Also, they will be switching over to a new lower price menu in about two weeks."}
{"text":"Annie Chiu no longer owns this restaurant. Sadly it has gone from very good to mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I usually only get Chinese food for takeout or delivery.  This place has a recommendation as being the best in the area.  We went on Chinese New Years.  Nice menu with specials.  Food was prepared well.  Ranged from good to excellent.  Portion size was nice.  Price was OK for what you received.  Servers were nice, ranging from friendly to downright entertaining.  So why not four stars?  This has to be the most poorly organized restaurant I've ever been to.  The food kept it from one star.  If you go there when it is slow, you will have a good time.  Watch out when it is busy.  You will likely meet all of the servers working that night.  I don't know how they keep up with things, knowing what each table needs (answer: they don't).  Then there is the manager.  She brought her toddler to work.  Cute when he is asleep and she is carrying him.  Not so cute when she sits down at an unoccupied table with him, gives him a bowl and a spoon to bang it with.  Yes, I have kids, but I don't go to a restaurant for this experience.  Also, beware using Restaurant.com certificates here.  The only restriction on them is that they are valid Sunday through Thursday.  We were there on a Sunday and the manager told the server she would not honor it because it was a holiday.  Nice way to use a promotion to lose business!"}
{"text":"Meh for sure. Would not come here without a coupon. The hot and sour soup is sweet. Yuck! It should be sour, spicy, and rich! That is not a good way to start. The dishes are OK, the quality of the ingredients are good but the preparation is lacking. The prices are too high for what you get. The egg roll was good. I guess I'm just spoiled by Hunan East. This may be a place that you love or hate."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Incredible service. Love this place and it has such a wonderful dining area. Small but nicely decorated and quant. You would never think to look where it's located, in a small strip mall off Taylor, just west of Cedar; but there it is and the food is divine. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I came in for something quick to eat. I'm headed to a painting class and didn't want to drink on an empty stomach. 

The place wasn't very clean. 

I've cut the majority of foods from my diet. So, I ordered the tofu with some sweet and sour sauce. First, the tofu wasn't cooked. It was rubbery and wet. When done right. Tofu should be dense with a bit of crisp. 
The sauce was okay, it was a bit too sweet. You could definitely tell it wasn't homemade. 

I just had water to drink. I also had some plain white rice. It was over cooked and tasted burnt. 
I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"the fat Asian waiter there was rude.  My dish was very salty and has the disgusting MSG sweet flavor that made me very thirsty! Hate the place!

And you get a clue if you don't see any Chinese in the Chinese restaurant.  Most dishes are too sweet and way overpriced!

Don't tell me they have authentic Chinese food because they don't!"}
{"text":"I've been there once and they know me by name.  As much as I would like to attribute this to my skills at making a first impression it is just the way of the world at Sun Luck Garden.  There isn't much to the decor but who needs ambiance when you have kick-ass food.  They are timely and correct with take-out orders and they don't treat you like a second-class citizen because you want to eat at home on your couch.  Spend money here!"}
{"text":"Not good.  So many better options in the Heights."}
{"text":"My family went here once on a whim and a restaurant.com gift certificate. And all I can say is wow. Who would have thought such an amazing restaurant could be located in this tiny little strip mall.

Food=Superb
Selection=Good
Pricing=Good
Service=Superb

We still talk about the food to this day. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner, quiet atmosphere. We were the only ones in minus a take out order. Server was super attentive. Ordered the crab Rangoon as an appetizer which was delicious  I ordered the curry chicken, my boyfriend ordered the lemon chicken. Mine was super spicy (perfect, I love spice) and his was super sweet (almost like a dessert, also yum). We also ordered vegetable fried rice. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Sun Luck many times, however the past few times have not been great.  Last week I spent $40 on 3 dishes for takeout.  Just pulling the food out of the bag, it smelled terrible.  Neither my husband or I could get more than one bite in before we threw it away.  I've gotten sick after eating here in the past and assumed it was something else.  Now I know, this place is disgusting.   Steer clear, there are plenty of other Chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Sun Luck Garden is by far the best Chinese restaurant on the East Side! We have tried so many others and now that we've found Sun Luck we don't have to try any more. 
Kuan is the absolute sweetest woman-she knows us by our order on the phone and knows how we like everything. She is so kind when we go in also! Our orders (often large) are always perfect-never any mistakes. 
Some of our favorite dishes include the BBQ spare ribs (they're amazing-sweet and spicy-huge chunks of meat!), chicken wings (crispy and delicious, even without sauce), hot and sour soup (it's always so hard to find good hot and sour-this is good), sweet and sour chicken (I never even used to like sweet and sour chicken, but their sauce is a bit less sweet and more flavorful than most), any of the fried rices (you can order with or without soy sauce!), and so many more. 
We love Sun Luck and love Kuan. Good people and good food. You should try it!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Food?  I've had better.  We ordered takeout. Both the phone conversation and the service upon entering the restaurant to get the order was exceptional.  When we got home, it was a different story. *Enter sad, disappointed face here!* Butternut soup and Hot and Sour soup were both extremely oily.  To the point where all we did was taste each one make the 'hell no' face, and move on. For the main dishes we had a veggie fried rice dish that was tasty but unremarkable, and the same went for the sweet and sour chicken.  Don't see a return visit any time in the near future."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food on the east side; probably in the city. And very vegetarian friendly; they have a vegetarian menu, and they understand what that means. (Some Chinese places put seafood in the \"vegetarian\" sauce.)

The recipes are unique and creative; not the usual generic fare. Service is great, and the atmosphere is nice; more modern than some (but small).

They have both \"light\" and \"dark\" tofu. Light tofu means normal soy tofu... dark tofu isn't soy-based but wheat-based; basically seitan. A different, chewier texture. Both are good.

They do some neat special recipes for Chinese New Year too.

Lunch is a great deal here--very cheap. But lunch is on Wednesdays only!"}
{"text":"Really terrible. Ordered takeout today. Order was 15min later than they told me it would take. Upon arriving home I found every item to be inedible. (mind you i hadn''t eaten all day too)
1) Beef lo Mein - soggy veggies, super nondescript flavor with occasional beef that looked like it was shredded and run over.
2) General Chicken - grainy sauce that was unidimentional and commercial. Orange undertones with some kinda generic szechuan mix added. Chicken was in nice chunks but tasted old. Broccoli was walked by the microwave, hardly cooked, and not seasoned.
3) Kung Pao Shrimp - microscopic (im not kidding 1cm by 1cm sized) shrimp with primarily green beans. Bland but tolerable save for the shrimp which had an iodine aftertaste.
4) Crab rangoon - \"best\" dish. Semi crunchy, moderate amount of filling. Good to see they could fry something...that was previously frozen.
5) Sweet and Sour Soup - unappealing grey brown color. Insanely dense mouthfeel, must have been thickener added, almost to the point of being gravy. Flavor too concentrated, unpleasant
6) white rice - made with lousy tap water
The restaurant it self is tiny and dark. Clientele seems to be an older local crowd. I am at a loss as to why they go there. Terrible experience for my first takeout in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place was completely empty on a weekday evening (maybe everyone normally gets take out?), so we got the place to ourselves. One waitress working, who was pretty attentive about refilling our tea. 

Food was decent for Chinese food in this area. We had the beef ho fun (flat rice noodles), which was good and came in a big portion size, but became a bit soggy upon a second heating. We also got sesame chicken, which was alright. Taste was okay, but very salty and heavy on the sauce, so you'd need a good helping of rice to go with. Last dish we got was tofu and fish in a clay pot. The tofu was softer than I expected (usually it's firm tofu) and there was a lot more fish pieces to tofu. Overall, taste was good, but I would've liked more tofu in it. It was also the most expensive dish of the meal at $15.95 (the others were both less than $10). One bonus though was that rice was not extra charge (it usually is at other Chinese places). 

Overall, decent place for Chinese food. Service is pretty good and food comes out pretty quickly. If dining in, it's located in a strip mall with lots of parking."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared a great meal here. The food was delicious, the portions generous enough to feed two people and the atmosphere relaxed and inviting. The staff is very attentive and you almost had the feel like you were dining in your favorite aunts or grandmothers home where relatives go out of their way to make certain you are enjoying your meal. There are lots of great things to explore on the menu. If you are looking for an unpretentious Chinese place that is well kept and welcoming with really enjoyably tasting food the Sun Luck Garden is worth a visit. The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I recently moved into the area and decided to try it out, since it's not too far from home. Terrible idea. The veggies tasted like they came from a can, the beef in the honey walnut beef dish smelled like old fish, and had a consistency I've never tasted before.  The mu shu chicken was unforgiveably bland and I've gotten better potstickers from wal-mart.  The boxes the two entrees came in were only two thirds of the way full and when I called to ask why I was told maybe my food had shrunken because it was so cold outside...ummm NO. I took the food back and got a full refund. I wouldn't eat here again if someone paid me to."}
{"text":"Had the Mai pou tofu for takeout. At first the tofu was all smushed, but then took the first bite and it was great! 

I wanted to add eggplant to it, willing to pay extra but the owner wouldn't and wanted me to pay for a huge order of eggplant. Was a little rude but the food was good."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Annie's for years and I look forward to it every time I visit Cleveland. The decor is colorful and festive, the service is wonderful (not only friendly and informed, but they turn the plates so that the decoration is facing the right way and they clear the table almost silently instead of banging the dishes together,) but most important, the food is delicious. There are always specials which aren't on the menu and are creative and flavorful, and asking for simple twists on menu staples (like extra almonds) can transform a dish into something special. Annie was a pastry chef previously and this is the only Chinese restaurant I know where you should definitely save room for dessert. The sorbets (really more granitas) are milk-free and taste exactly like the fruits that name them, and the baked dishes are exceptional.

I do not see Asians in this restaurant as a rule, but it is usually filled with repeat customers who are enthusiastic about the food and the experience. It is an east-side favorite among those who know about it, including a former east-sider like me!"}
