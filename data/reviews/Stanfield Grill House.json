{"text":"As a rule, I'll take an independent little breakfast diner over any chain and the Stanfield is no exception.  Hiding out in the corner of a squat little office tower in a mostly industrial area, the place is easy to miss. Waiting for my car to be serviced,  I fired up Yelp to find an alternative to the stale  magazines and disturbing snatches of phone conversation in the shop's  waiting room. The big swing in Yelp ratings made me want to try the place out for myself, maybe settle the score.  The decor is clean and new, looking a little bit like those remodeled Tim Horton's cafe style stores with faux brick inside, gas fireplace, big comfy,  private booths and a few TV's scattered around.   This Wednesday morning, service seemed to favour the regulars as the servers were busy chatting with them and didn't notice my empty coffee. Wave and a nod later, and I'm sorted, so no harm.  I had a breakfast that would have scored an approving nod and grunt from Ron Swanson. Good sized portion, bottomless coffee all at a price a little better than similar places across the highway in Toronto.   Nice family vibe, no rush to get me out and lots of free newspapers  (the Sun, why even ask?). If I was in the area again, I'd be back."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect example of the ultimate Greek-Canadian diner - which is a genre that is slowly dying elsewhere in the GTA. It is quite refreshing to see it alive and well at Stanfield. Delicious all day breakfast which includes the quintessential feta cheese omelet in addition to the classics. The diner classics from burgers to liver with onions. And the straight forward, friendly, down to earth service."}
{"text":"Stanfield's is always crowded, but we managed to get a table for Sunday breakfast, and it was well worth the 10 minute wait.  Sharon, our server, was exceptional.  Unlimited coffee refills and friendly service make this the cat's meow!  The prices are very reasonable, and the food is great."}
{"text":"I work nearby and usually order take-out. Service is friendly and the food is good. While not  stellar, this diner-type restaurant is a great breakfast and  lunch option if you are located or work in Southeast Mississauga. Best bets are all-day breakfast, hamburgers,  greek salad and fish and chips."}
{"text":"Great place and food. Staff is very welcoming and entertaining. Feels like a family setting"}
{"text":"Family Day and this place is packed with locals; many of them seniors.  Waited 5 minutes for a table for 4...began with bottomless  Java!  We're all here for the Texas Breakfast; $7.99 before 11am, add $1.00 afterwards.  Bonus: potatoes (..home fries, French fries) are not frozen.  Very friendly staff and great service from our Server Ro.  This restaurant is a hidden gem to most residents of this great city."}
{"text":"Had lunch here while waiting for a tire change at Kal Tire right beside. Kal Tire customers enjoy a 10% discount here. The service was quite interesting. At first I was asked if I wanted a menu. Why, oh why would you ask me that? Do you think I have it memorized or I just came to chill? Well, the waitress passed the menu over somebody's head to me - poor girl enjoying her salad. Thirty seconds after she came up to me and asked if I was ready to order. No, I don't look like a speed reader. Obviously, I was on page one of the menu. Then the lady forgets about me for the next fifteen minutes - take your time reading slow boy.  The menu claims they have the best burgers in town. And their wraps are the best. And fish & chips too. And literally everything else. Looking at the past reviews I got myself a burger with a side of greek salad. The patty was a little burnt, and I wasn't impressed with the salad either. I finished my meal pretty quickly, and then I was waiting for the waitress to come up to me and give me the bill - I think that's what usually happens in restaurants, right? Well, after waiting for fifteen minutes I had to come up to the counter and just pay there without getting the bill.   Next time I go to Kal Tire I'm taking five extra minutes to walk to McDonald's."}
{"text":"I had the chicken special, with greek salad. Good portion. Good price. Served with pita bread. I enjoyed the food very much. Decor was good. Lots of locals. Service was fast for me.I will come back, and thank you for the good lunch! Do you have a discount if I get my tire fixed at Kal-tire?"}
{"text":"Popped over here for some lunch while I was waiting for a tire to get fixed... I've seen the place a few times and was excited to go try it and see if it was a place I'd bring friends over to since it's close to my place...  Walked into the bar area and was going to sit there but opted for the patio and the bartender (surprisingly friendly.. keep reading..) informed me of the wifi password and gave me a menu to peruse on the patio..  I heard her mention to the server that someone was going to the patio and a few minutes later she showed up with a glass of water.  I ordered the Friday fish special ($10 instead of $13 if you order a drink) -- ew. The fish was WAY over-battered and way undercooked for the slathered amount of batter. The cole slaw was good though. Oh, but that tartar sauce? I actually had to spit it out....   Funny that when I asked her opinion on the caesar or greek salad she suggested caesar and I asked how it was made, like from a sauce they put on it or do they actually make the sauce inhouse? \"what\" -- ok whatever, bottled dressing it is.. whatev.. I hate part of it when it came but was pretty pedestrian..   Then I never saw the waitress again at my table on the patio... i.e. had to get up to go inside and ask the server to do her job and serve... BUT, since I came in she thought I was ready to go.. \"No, I would like another drink but I never saw you again\" -- and I tried to order an \"8th Sin\" beer that was there, and given that she was not the bartender I wouldn't expect her to know what I was talking about, but there are only 3 beers on tap so I guess she should know.. So then this other woman who works there jumps into the convo with her summer-teeth (if you know the expression you know what I mean) and she looked at me like I was talking some foreign language asking for a f*cking beer, so I had to physically point at the tap and then she was like \"oh we don't have that\" in a manner like I should've just known that of the minimally-3 taps that only two were there.. and then she mentioned something about bottles and I thought she was saying that there was the one on the end in bottles too.. \"Uh no thanks, you're right, I am now ready to go...\"  Someone behind/beside started talking about the fact that they come there for the good food and the spicy service! LMAO.. I was just so past it that I almost went off about how neither the service nor the food was good, but luckily my mind got sidetracked by the old fart alcoholic at the bar mutterring under his breath 'airhead' and I just let it slide because he'll be dead soon...   The $5.95 wine can't even draw me back to this place.. The clientele and the staff are meant for each other..  Fuck all y'all -- I'll never be back you scuzzy losers......"}
{"text":"Nice Lil family restaurant.  Prices are really good and portion of food is more than the norm.  Got the fish & chips, steak frites and pork solvaki dinner.  The meals were really good but some of the French fries were under cooked.  The steak had 20% fatty parts which wasn't really good to consume.  The fish and chips were so so not enough Tatar sauce.  Definitely worth coming back further to try their other food."}
{"text":"Not sure when they did the reno and changed the name to Stanfield Grill but it's still a family restaurant overall.  I guess it was out with the Mel's Diner fixtures (I'm dating myself here!) and in came the booths, dark wood, stack stones and the like.  If I'm wrong, then the owners years ago were forward thinkers.  The clientele are mostly locals and regular.  They were packed for late lunchtime.  My buds and I had the fish and chips and two Wednesday specials (Burgers, Poutine, Pop).  It was standard diner fair.  Nice size burger patty that look homemade with a decent serving of poutine.  Tasted quite good.  The have a full bar, and something different on the food menu each day.  The wait staff are friendly, helpful, honest - yep...told me what I would definitely no want!  LOL!  Worth a return trip if I end up in that part of town again.  Cheers!"}
