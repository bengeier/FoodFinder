{"text":"Just went in here for the first time. Friendly service, great coffee and breakfast! Clean, comfortable store. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"What do you get when you go looking for a new dining experience with great atmosphere, great food, great wine, beer, and coffee? Macchiatos Coffee and Wine Bar! I hesitate to share this because this restaurant is such a great find I want to keep it all to myself. Last week-end we were looking for a new place for wine tasting, and good food. We found this place (in DeForest, in an unassuming strip mall) on line, and decided at the last minute to cancel our original destination to an upscale wine tasting establishment in Madison. We were told the special at Macchiatos  was butternut squash ravioli. Upon arriving we discovered a very eclectic decorated establishment with statues, pillars, great fire place, heavy wood tables, and leather furniture. The ambiance was very relaxing, AND quiet! We told Chris the assistant manager we were excited about the ravioli but were sadly informed it was to be the next day's special. He noted  our disappointment and told us since we had been misled, he would make the ravioli for us! With a table next to the roaring fire, the wine tasting commenced. The ravioli was exquisite, The wine was superb, to top it off the chef had made the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted. It was moist dark chocolate, with succulent cherries in the middle, and the frosting was rich and not too sweet. We will be returning again tonight!"}
{"text":"Visiting family in DeForest and working for the first week of a two week trip, I needed somewhere to \"plug in\" with coffee and food. I lucked out. Macchiato's opened a week or two before we arrived. Only good coffee in town unless you like McDonald's or Denny's style coffee. I mostly drink black coffee and their blend is excellent. I also tried their latte since they had a $1 latte special one day. They have a full list of espresso drinks. I spent all of Monday there and half of Tuesday and was made to feel welcome by the owner/partner, Gary, and staff. There is plenty of comfortable seating inside including areas to lounge and tables. It is nicely decorated. Their breakfast sandwiches are very good and I had a nice salad for lunch. I have not been in for wine. But it would be a nice spot to enjoy a glass. They also have bottled beer from some of the better local breweries."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch!  This was our 2nd visit for Sunday brunch--this is such a great asset for DeForest and Dane County.  The ambiance is fantastic--very tastefully and contemporary decorations.  Even the bathrooms are top notch.  The brunch is affordable and absolutely the best I've had anywhere in Dane County.  Everything is made from scratch using local and/or organic wherever possible.  Brunch features made to order pancakes as well as omelets.  Seriously--every single thing is amazing (smoked salmon, caprese salad, monkey bread, cheesy hashbrowns, eggs benedict, lasagna, and this seriously amazing Ghirardelli chocolate brownie/lava goodness.    Thank you for being here in De Forest and for being such a comfortable place to come for brunch and really anytime.  WiFi, daily events (a tour of craft beer happening this week, wine tasting, girls night, etc.).    If this review doesn't persuade you, perhaps the 2 for 1 make your own bloody mary bar and the live piano playing will bring you in?"}
{"text":"DeForest has been in need of a coffee shop like this for many years. Everyone who works here from the owners who come to your table to chat with you to the employees who remember your order and your name make this a stellar addition to the community. The food is great, decently priced; the beverages are excellent; the energy and atmosphere are bright and positive. If you don't live in DeForest, I recommend a trip out to see what they offer. They have wine and tapas in the evening, as well, and a brunch on Sunday. It's definitely worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Food was delicious.  The only thing that could be improved is the amount of room between tables.  Hard to maneuver when going to buffet line.  I can see why this place is becoming a local favorite."}
{"text":"Great place to meet somebody for lunch!  Reasonable prices and you don't have to walk out feeling stuffed......but you can if you want to."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Macchiatos Coffee & Wine Bar, we came here to celebrate Valentine's Day, and take part in the Thursday night Tarot reading they offer.  We entered the address into our GPS, and set out to find out what Macchiatos Coffee & Wine Bar had to offer... At first glance, upon arriving,  you may not realize \"you have arrived at your destination\", but trust me, you have, and you won't be disappointed.   Macchiatos Coffee & Wine Bar is a rare pearl of an establishment located at the end of a strip mall on Main Street in Deforest, Wisconsin.  Please don't let the location fool you, Macchiatos Coffee & Wine Bar commands your attention, and beckons you to go beyond the understated parking lot, and step inside this beautiful hidden gem of a restaurant, Coffee & Wine Bar.   Once you set foot beyond the front doors, you are immediately transported into a rich elegant environment  much different from what you were expecting to see from the parking lot you just left behind.  The interior of Macchiatos Coffee & Wine Bar is both warm & inviting.  Despite its massive size, the space is set up with plenty of eclectic seating, and privacy screens that would accommodate any size group,  from a large formal gathering, right down to an intimate & romantic rendezvous for two.   The staff, and counter service were equally warm and welcoming.  We had dinner & drinks and both had exceeded our expectations.  The food was fresh, hot and very delicious. Orders for both food and drink are taken at the bar. You place your order, pay for your selections, and are given a small chalkboard with your name written on it to take to your table.  Your drink is served immediately, and your food is brought to your table when ready.  There were no waiters or waitresses hovering over your table distracting you from your conversation.  No interruptions.  And we were not made to feel rushed to clear the space for other customers.   It was one of the most enjoyable, and romantic dinners we have had dinning out.   This was our first experience at Macchiatos Coffee & Wine Bar, but it wont be our last.  We are looking forward to taking advantage of some of the other specials that they offer, like the wonder brunch they have advertised, as well as trying many of the other items on their menu... or maybe just to get away and spend some quality time together with my wife, or just hanging out with a group of close friends. :)"}
{"text":"We went to Macchiato's for Sunday Brunch because a neighbor of ours had mentioned they were not just a coffee and wine bar.  Wow were we impressed.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  The brunch was huge.  It had items for both vegetarians and meat eaters.  The ambiance was great with a live piano player and fireplace.  There was an omelet and pancake station, salad area with a delish caprese salad and smoked salmon among other things, huge hot food buffet with eggs benedict and Spinach benedict, sausage, bacon, biscuits & sausage gravy, monkey bread, scrambled eggs, Florentine quiche, cheesy hash browns, tater tots and breakfast enchilada's and honeyed chicken.  Desserts included were a brownie dessert and pineapple upside down cake.  They were running a buy one get one free bloody mary's or mimosa's .  And \"good\" coffee, tea, juice and iced tea were included.  I can't believe it took us this long to find this treasure hidden in a coffee and wine bar.  Great experience we will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, scrumptious portabella sandwich, amazing decor, cozy fireplace seating, joyful staff, great prices, clean as a whistle ~ we'll definitely be back! #coffeeshop #explore"}
{"text":"This place has class falling out its a...hem, its elbow.  Seriously swanky coffee, wine and tapas bar (with a full menu as well), with a definitely ornate modern Italian decor, you'll think you missed the turn for DeForest and ended up in Chicago somehow. Don't let the strip mall exterior dissuade you, this place is sweeeeeet.  I arrived here after a day of family history touring around the DeForest area, out of curiosity. DeForest is such a nice little town, and has needed a place like this forever. I dreamed of opening one myself, back when I lived here, and this place definitely fits the bill.   I was warmly greeted by Chris when I entered; I let him know I'd never been in before, and he gave me the tour. It's nice to have such personal service and to see so much positivity and obvious excitement and pride in this place, which opened in June 2014. I really hope they do well.  The restrooms are as luxe as the rest of the place, with snazzy black fixtures and lovely furnishings. The entire place is open and airy, yet warm and inviting due to the fireplace and very comfortable yet stylish seating.   I only stopped for coffee (they serve Just Coffee, the Rocket Fuel variety, when I stopped in) today, but due to Chris' thorough explanation of their menu, I will definitely be back for brunch very soon. Bloody Mary bar? Yes, please. Really reasonable pricing, especially considering that they use local and organic ingredients as much as possible. All of the offerings look delicious and enticing. The pastries and other baking are all done in-house, as well.  They have different things going on here every night of the week, from game night to date night to tarot readings.   Welcome to the 'hood, Macchiatos. Classin' up the joint? Yer doin' it right."}
{"text":"While Macchiatos is still a little rough around the edges, there is much to appreciate. The staff is friendly and the space is warm and welcoming.  While the food did not hit it out of the park during my visit, there is enough potential to draw me back for a return visit.    I decided to check out Macchiatos after seeing a couple positive Yelp reviews and noticing the check-in offer for a free cup of coffee.  I'll admit feeling some skepticism seeing the address - I remember that strip mall location as the old DeForest Public Library from my days of living in DeFo.  That concern vanished as I walked in the door.  The owner completely gutted the old space and created a cozy oasis for the locals to caffeinate during the day and enjoy a glass of wine and tapas during the evening.    Utilizing a palette of autumn tones (dark green, burgundy, harvest gold) and an exposed brick wall behind the coffee bar, the space is immediately puts you at ease.  Also appreciated is the local artwork on the walls of the facility.  While there are plenty of tables to sit at, I wish there were more sofas and comfy chairs.  The music, a heavy mix of 60's and 70's rock, was louder than you find in most other coffeehouses.  The wi-fi signal (ask a staff member for the password) was strong, making a Macchiatos a great pit stop grab a cup of Joe and get some work done when away from home.  The cheerful staff at Macchiatos helped me successfully navigate my first visit to their establishment.  They greeted me as I entered, described the breakfast options available that day and delivered my sandwich to me.  I noticed the owner chatting with the regulars and bussing tables, keeping the place looking sharp for my entire stay.  I liked, not loved, my classic breakfast sandwich (cage free organic egg, cheddar cheese, and apple wood smoked bacon on a ciabatta roll).  While I enjoyed the bacon and egg components, the slightly dry ciabatta roll dominated each bite - there was just too much bread in relation to the other ingredients.  The coffee, a dark roast from Just Coffee Cooperative, needed a dose of sugar to offset the bitter finish.  While I enjoyed the space more than the food during my first visit, Macchiatos is definitely a place I will return to the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Rarely, perhaps never before, have I eaten at a restaurant offering a breakfast buffet and actually enjoyed every dish I tried.  No dried out potatoes, fake eggs, greasy bacon, etc.  Everything was fresh and flavorful and the assortment of items was perfect.  The price is incredibly reasonable when you consider that it includes a variety of beverages and relaxing piano music playing in the background.  I'll be back again and again."}
