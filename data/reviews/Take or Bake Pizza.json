{"text":"Little Cesar's move over there is a new sheriff in town!! Great little pizza joint with good customer service, will def be back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Took a pizza home to bake and was delicious! Will definitely be stopping back again."}
{"text":"The store is clean, the staff is very friendly and polite. 

The Pizza is good, but once I found out they'll add toppings to the cheesy bread, I was hooked. These things are addictive :). We've been back 3 or 4 times now for these cheese sticks....PS: get the bacon!"}
{"text":"The staff isn't exceedingly friendly, but they're not rude either. That's the one thing this place is missing. The food is fantastic, I love it, I've been looking for a new pizza joint and Take or Bake is it. I'm not going to bore you with superlatives and fancy adjectives describing their food, rather simply saying that their pizza is damn good, and you should give them a try. If you're disappointed then your tastebuds are broken and you're probably walking around while in a coma. Shame on you. Enjoy their food!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened, especially because I live papay Murphy's. Well let's just say this is just as good if not better than papa Murphy's. We got a large pepperoni pizza for only 5.99. Can't beat that. My BF picked up the pizza, so I'll wait to comment on the customer service until I experience my self"}
{"text":"Thank god for a great alternative to little ceasars, I get so tired of their chewy lukewarm pizza and I love that there's another option just a few minutes drive away from my house!  
I stop by here at least once or twice every 2 weeks, and I'm never dissapointed at all. Sometime's there is a short wait, but it's worth it for a fresher pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza, great prices, and friendly service! They offered to help me carry the food because I am pregnant.  Will be back.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Take or Bake 

I like the concept of someone else making a pizza and then you take it home and cook it. At take or bake it's just as the name implies, take it home and bake it yourself or have them bake it for you. 

I figured that the pizza would be similar in taste to that of Little Caesar's. Good price, but you get what you pay for, and I was correct. The pizza isn't bad, but what can you expect for $5.99.  The pizza isn't  as good as any traditional pizza places  but you could do worse in a pinch."}
{"text":"Had the pepperoni and cheese pizza with onions and extra cheese for dinner last night and had them bake it. Once I got it home I had to throw it in the oven to keep it warm while I did a few things around the house, finally opening the box after about a 1/2 hour and I was super stoked as the smell hit my nose! The crust was great, the flavor and crispness pretty spot on and reminded me of back east. The sauce was not overly seasoned as many are and even had the slight sweetness that makes a good pie sauce. The cheese was pretty awesome too, has the fresher mozzarella taste. I highly recommend checking out this local business and I can't wait to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Prices are great for what you get and the pizza is good. Easy fix to a quick dinner or for birthday party's. Staff is friendly and welcoming. Food is don't fast too. Definitely recommend this pace to anyone"}
{"text":"Bye bye pizza delivery!  This place is close to our home and gets it right EVERY TIME!  
20 minute wait to pick up a pizza is standard, but we have had even shorter turnaround times.

I love this pizza, and unless something changes, I'll never have to have a pizza delivered again!"}
