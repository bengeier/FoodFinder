{"text":"Great Meal and ambiance for Valentine's day 2016.
We had been up to Feliciano about two years ago and
and a beautiful evening on the patio. We were in the 
area again and our group decided to make reservations for  
the Valentine's dinner. 
\"CHEF WARREN\" came out and gave the ladies roses.
We had ordered several different items from the menu.
The favorite appetisers were Croquette de Filet Mignon,
Aioli de Truffes and Calamari Aioli au Safron. Absolutely delicious.
The favorite entrées were
Grilled Black Angus Bavette and Grilled Lamb Chops marinated 
in white wine and crème de menthe. Also fantastic.
We look forward to going back and trying some other Mediterranean
items from their menu."}
{"text":"Good food, best terrace north of Montreal.
Cheapskate owner would'nt light up the propane warmers because \"it costs too much\"\"and anyhow the propane tanks are empty\"...we were a table of 4 spending  upwards of two hundred dollars (not including wine as this is a bring your own)....it was a 16 Celsius .....very cool night...we ended up frozen so as not being able to enjoy what would otherwise be a most agreable experience."}
{"text":"Cette fois-ci nous avons opté pour le tartare de cerf qui s'est avéré délicieux ainsi que l'agneau qui est selon moi toujours bien réussi... Bref encore une excellente soirée"}
{"text":"We called to reserve a seat on the terrace but ended up getting a place without lighting so we ended up eating inside. 
Then we stumbled upon a bad waiter. It took an hour to get our food. I asked at least for bread and it came after the food. Then my wife had the risotto which tasted mostly tomatoes. Hopefully if we go back it will be better."}
{"text":"We are trying to be an impressive place to eat \"High Fashion\" food, but it flat out does not work for me. The decor is dowdy, but there is a fabulous outdoor dining garden in front of the building. I had two large crab cakes (well presented) and a main course of Fettuccine Alfredo that was completely banale and unpleasingly presented. However, the coffee was good....so, the two crab cakes, a bowl of fettuccine and one cup of coffee set me back 46.00$ plus tax plus tip......do the math!"}
{"text":"If you want to eat outside under a tent, this is the place and it's fun. You can bring your wine and that's a plus in any restaurant in Quebec. Even low quality table wines are very expensive in this area. We were a group of 10 friends and sat this Saturday outside to have a great meal. 

We were very disappointed. 

We each took something different from the table d'hôte. What was recommended was the braised pork and the veal liver. Those two dishes were reportedly very tasty and somewhat copious. You can't go wrong either with the bisque and the endive salad.

What our friends did not like was the tasteless and tough steak of bavette (flank steak), the very small portion of veal kidneys (six small pieces floating in their sauce), the fish of the day that was covered with a blueberry sauce to hide the burned sides, the insipid ris de veau (calf sweetbread) fried until they're hard like a rock. As for vegetables in your plates, you can eat them all in a single mouthful. 

If this restaurant advertised itself as new cuisine, we would have understood the lack of food in our plates. But it's not.

The table next to us was so disgusted with the food and the service that they left without paying. They were also told that they could not smoke in that area, which was okay with me but not them. You can't enjoy a meal surrounded by the foul and acrid smell of cigarette smoke. 

The boss told the waitress, Evelyn, that she would have to pay the $360 from her own salary and tips. She was crying when she came to collect of bills and we gave her more tips than usual.

All in all, it was not a good experience in food tasting, but the ambiance is great and we were with great friends."}
