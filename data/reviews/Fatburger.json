{"text":"The evening walk down Vegas strip made us hungry and we seen a Fatburger. We sat down at a high bar table and no one came to our table to take our order so we went up to cashier and placed an order. When the food arrived the burgers were cooked to our preference. The burgers were huge and made neatly. We would go here again for anoth4r burger."}
{"text":"Loved the medium fat burger and onion rings. Shake was great too. Sitting outside in the mist was brilliant in the heat of a summer night. Good service and quality burger."}
{"text":"Strike 1: We stood in line for 10 minutes (I'm not exaggerating) while both employees were busy filling orders. No one else was in line, so we figured they'd finish soon.

Strike 2: Five more minutes pass and another lady stands in line behind us. Customer #2 must've been raised by gorillas because she jumped at the cashier as soon as she was free. Did the cashier do the right thing and acknowledge we had been standing in line longer? Noooo. I said, \"Excuse me, we're next in line!\" Cashier smiled. Thanks, your smile completely made up for the hag's rudeness and your slow a$$ service. FML

STRIKE 3: Despite clearly stating NO MAYO on my grilled chicken sandwich, she put in mayo. Before taking a bite, I noticed little patches of MOLD on the BUNS!!! 

THANK YOU, FATBURGER, FOR WASTING 30 minutes of our lives to serve us  food FUNGUS! Hey, HEALTH INSPECTOR... I've got a burger joint in Green Valley Ranch you should check out!

STAY AWAY from this garbage dump!!!"}
{"text":"Great waitress. Fast. Knew her stuff.  Pleasant. And fun to talk to. Great place for a late night drink or a much needed burger."}
{"text":"Fat burger is hands down the best fast food burger I have ever eaten.  The quality of beef paired with the perfect combination of condiments makes fat burger a necessity on every Vegas trip.  I suggest at least a double burger with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg.  It's my belief that lettuce has no business on a burger but get it with everything else.  If you follow these instructions and are disappointed you may want to set yourself an appointment with a psychiatrist you just might be crazy."}
{"text":"Now they have an open bar outside with waiting service. Big change with last year, changes inside too with the seating. Good thing is it's 24/7. I remember it tasted better years ago. Now it's just like any other place. First time eating since 2008."}
{"text":"If whoever owns this franchise really cares about protecting the Fatburger brand, they'll dump the crew that was working late morning on Saturday, 1/25.  My wife and I walked in and were immediately jolted by the loud, thumping dance music being played on the house system.  What?!?!  Photos of everybody from Miles Davis to T-bone Walker on the walls, and you're playing this crap?  It got worse.  We ordered at the counter, and while we were waiting another couple came in, ordered, and then sat outside to wait for their food.  We watched the young woman who took the orders deliver food to them, and suspected that she had given them our order.  sure enough, a couple minutes later, counter girl came to our table and said \"I'm sorry, I accidentally gave them your order.\"  Really easy to see how confusing it could have been with a total of four people in the entire place!  When our food did arrive, I found a puddle of grease at the bottom of my order of half-cooked onion rings.
Sad.  I like Fatburger (and part of the reason is the music selection).  but the unsupervised kids who were working that day found a way to make it a really crappy experience."}
{"text":"If you've been to a Fatburger before, you know what to expect.

The food is on par with every other restaurant in the chain that I've visited, which is to say incredibly greasy and fattening --the way an item named \"Fatburger\" should be.

I've never had a bad experience here, but it could stand to be a little cleaner and the food is still only a notch above standard fast food fare."}
{"text":"Its the worst burger i ever had, the meat was so dry and salty, Service was slow, the place is so dirty.and top of that you pay almost $12 fir a burger you're expecting to be a good one but its very disappointing.. I never recommend this place"}
{"text":"This is probably the best burger joint in Calgary, located near some pretty convenient shopping at Deerfoot Meadows.

The burgers are fresh and made to order. You can also order turkey burgers and veggie burgers and there's even hot dogs for those that don't want a delicious burger.

For those of you who want a beer with your burger, you can order that too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The bartender Joe was incredibly helpful with finding me a great beer. He was very knowledgeable and super fun. I definitely recommend anybody, locals or tourists to come dine t fat burger"}
{"text":"o atendimento e a comida demoraram a se apresentar. o hambúrguer veio meio frio. shake de banana bom. hot dog e hambúrgueres OK. nada de menos, nada de mais. uma das únicas opções na strip de madrugada. por isso  4 estrelas, senão seriam 3."}
{"text":"Worst Fatburger I have ever experienced.  Food was incorrect and took forever. Cashier was amazing and doing jobs for four other people while the rest were messing everything up. Will not come back."}
{"text":"I love the food at Fatburger, I just don't love this particular location. They always close ridiculously early and the times on the website are different than the ones here listed on Yelp: \"Operating Hours: Sun-Thu: 11am-8pm | Fri-Sat: 11am-10pm\". I've been in this location at 7:30pm and seen customers turned away around 7:45pm being told that they were already closed.

I recently went there on a Friday night at 9:30pm and almost all of the chairs in the restaurant had already been put on top of tables and employees were already walking out. My party and I ordered food and found a place to sit and I was enjoying my meal... until I found a long dark hair wrapped around one of my fries. I asked for a refund on my fries and was given one, yet without any apology. 

Even though this location is closest to me, I only was able to visit a few times since they always closed too early and now I will never go back that I've found hair in my food. Find a cleaner Fatburger where employees care about quality and aren't rushing to get out of there."}
{"text":"went in to try their famous XXXL burger, their soda machine was down so they were offering can sodas and promised free refills with the soda purchase, asked for another can of soda and the cashier was like annoyed by me for asking, they messed up my order and put all kinds of things on it that I did not ask for, every bite was smothered in mustard and relish. the 3 employees were like hiding in the back you'd have to wait a while before anyone would come to the counter for anyone needing help. horrible service extremely dirty restrooms that appeared to not have been cleaned up for a long time."}
{"text":"Whoever owns this location is determined to wring every penny out of it without keeping it up.  The \"24 HOURS\" sign is lit (well, most of it) but they aren't open 24 hours.  No music inside.  The beverage machine screams in need of maintenance and the drive thru electronics don't work.  I never see the same employees twice.  The food is still good and the place is clean, but, Jeesh, could the owners make it any less obvious that they do not care about customer service or the Fatburger name?"}
{"text":"First time here.  Employees were friendly and food was made fresh.  Burgers were huge and tasty.  Skinny chili cheese fries were awesome.  Hubby had fat fries.  Chocolate milkshake was ok.  It was vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup.  Doesn't anyone make it with real chocolate ice cream anymore?"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood, so I decided to drop by again to try their  burger

Still had difficulty finishing the meal due to the sheer size of it, but can't really complain about the freshness of both the burgers and the salad.

Customer service was ok"}
{"text":"It's hard for me to give this place 4 stars because of the cashier but other than her everything was great! The cashier barely spoke at all, didn't answer our questions with actual words...more like head nods and noises. She didn't repeat our order to us which of course ended up being wrong but we didn't know until we actually got our burgers. Other than her, we've always had a good experience here and the food has always been good!"}
{"text":"Worst Fatburger location in NV, possibly the nation. After sitting for 10 minutes without being greeted at the intercom and staring at a menu board with prices taped up by scotch tape (I couldn't leave because someone was behind and in front of me, I finally placed my order. I wish I hadn't been able to watch them in the kitchen while waiting for my food. It was a wreck with food storage containers laying around everywhere. The employees were clueless and I decided not to eat my meal for fear of food poisoning."}
{"text":"Consistently great burger! Wings are good too. The fish sandwich is a winner as well. Hard to beat the freashness for sure! Maybe a little pricey but this place is not really fastfood."}
{"text":"Don't let some of the other reviews scare you. This place is simply the best burger joint in all of the gta. Amazingly fresh burgers that are affordable. I always get the bbq burger and it's amazing every-time."}
{"text":"Fatburger is a good burger. 
Unfortunately, the service at this location is quite opposite. I have gone a total of three times to this location. My wife has an allergy to flour which they accommodated (Music + Burgers+ accommodation = 2 stars). The staff's \"attitude\" towards customers completely outweighed and took away the other 3 stars.   There was one employee that was the worst. Throughout the whole process of ordering she acted as if she didn't care that we were there and like we were causing her pain and wished we weren't there. That same employee tried rushing us out even though there were several hours before they closed. We asked politely if there was a reason why and she said no. 

Then 10 minutes later, she asked us to leave because we had children walking around and they didn't want a little 2 year old who no longer wanted to sit in the high chair.

We found Fatburger to be, though they target children with their \"kids meals\", very unfriendly towards little kids. 

Out of the three times I went to Fatburger, this rude employee was there and the third time of me being there has caused me to want to not go anymore. Because of the staff and their attitude,  which is a sign of poor management, I will no longer take my business there. In and out and Joe's Farm grill will be my choices next time."}
{"text":"By far the worst burger i've ever eaten in 30 years. 
It's 11pm, myself and 6 other guys walk in. The front doors were open, it's sweltering hot inside(did i mention it was 11pm?). The side door by the outside patio was propped open by a broomstick sticking out across the sidewalk(lawsuit waiting to happen)...

We each order the \"XXL\" with egg and bacon, chilli cheese fries and a drink 
($17 ?!?). 
After 15-20min, our order came out in a standard greasy brown paper lunchbag.

First bite: too much mustard, relish is very sour, patty is burnt around the edges.
I tried eating about 1/3rd of the patty alone, then threw everything out.

Wish I would have gone to one of the burger chains instead for $7.
Next time head to In N' Out and come home satisfied."}
{"text":"I came here on a thursday night. There was a sign that said to seat yourself and so my party did. This place was not busy at all, but it took over 20 minutes to get someone to help us. We had to go up to a server to ask to place an order. After we got our slushies and fries, they did not taste good at all. I did not taste alcohol in the drink and the fries were soggy."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a burger lover and have been to Fatburger in Red Deer a couple times on my way through. It is usually pretty darn good however this location off of 32nd served overcooked burgers, undercooked fries and a sesame bun that I couldn't even eat it. The bun was so dry it feel apart and I had to discard and eat the overcooked burger on its own. 1 tiny piece of bacon and the condiment proportions were way off. Way too much relish! 

No we will not be back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a milkshake. Was told the ice cream was too hard and it would only make a \"runny ass shake.\"  Asked how long it would take if we waited. We were told \"20 minutes but we will be closed then.\"  Funny that this exact thing happens last week too. Guess they don't need he business. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"This is only my second yelp review. I only write them when I have a very noteworthy experience so believe me when I say this was one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. To keep it simple Ill just bullet point my experience below. 
 
1.Walked in for breakfast. Saw an employee sitting at a booth eating McDonald's breakfast.  See four other employees standing doing nothing.
 
2.Looked at menu and ordered breakfast burrito and side of ham steak, listed on menu for 3 dollars. 
 
3.Told they don't carry ham steak. 
 
4.Change it to bacon. Ask about what the \"bread basket\" for 10dollars is.  Told they only have English muffins now. The rest didn't sell we'll. 
 
5.Finish order and choose to eat outside. Proceed to walk past the employee sitting at the bar drinking beer and watching basketball. 
 
6.Wait for 20 minutes for my breakfast burrito. 
 
7.Look around at the restaurant where no food is being delivered during the 20 minutes. 

8.Begin to breathe smoke as employee drinking beer at bar decides to light up cigarette. 
 
9.Wait 15 more minutes for food, only being asked how I'm doing once. 
 
10.Get food, which was fine. Just ok. 
 
11.Watch another employee behind bar texting her BFF or something. Had to get up and ask for silverware. Was pointed to where I could get it myself. 
 
12.Finished food, getting asked by what looked like the janitor (he had been cleaning the metal around the bar, sweeping, etc.) how my meal was. Was tempted to leave him the tip instead. 
 
13.Walked out without tipping and wrote yelp review, then wrote fat burger Vegas off my list. 
 
I suggest you skip steps 1-12 above and start right at step 13."}
{"text":"open 24 hours and on the strip....so if you need to get your burger fix on, then go here.  

But if you can get your eat on during regular hours, then go to in n out on dean martin via a cab.   Had the steak cut fries and burger combo, next time i'll have to try the skinny fries or the onion rings.  

Nothing special, but if you have to get your eat on at night then a decent option."}
{"text":"This place is delicous! It can be very pricey but it is a satisfying burger. I can't stray from the buffalo chicken burger, so saucy and flavourful."}
{"text":"I always get the grilled chicken sandwich and fat fries.  The chicken is almost always cooked perfectly, juicy and not over cooked, which is a rarity even in 'real' restaurants.  The fat fries are always excellent too!"}
{"text":"Fatburger is a fast food revelation.
Where else can you get a fat, juicy fast food burger, topped with the freshest ingredients, and a cold draft beer to wash it down?  Only at Fatburger, I tell ya.
Sure, it's not as fast as your typical fast food joint, and it costs a little more, but you'll understand why when you get your meal, which is made to order and delivered hot to your table by the friendly, efficient staff.  Since I was here just for a snack, I ordered a Babyfat, which cost $3.99, and came loaded with lettuce, onions, mustard, relish and pickles.  The beef patty was perfect - thin, charred just the right amount - just the way I like it.  You can add cheese, bacon, or mushrooms to your burger if you so choose, and they offer combo meals that include fries or onion rings and a drink.
I dare say that until Calgary gets an In-N-Out franchise, Fatburger will reign supreme as the best fast food burger in the city."}
{"text":"This place never disappoint us when we're in Vegas. Normally, we'd stop here first before checking in to our hotel. 

You have to try their chillie cheese fries! I love how their fries are thick enough to with hold the toppings and still crisp. 

The best part is their fresh juicy burgers. Ive never had their other sandwiches but why bother when I can have the best burger! 
Along with that gotta wash it down with their cookies n' cream milk shake! 

If you're on a diet, this place isn't your spot but believe me it'll be worth every single bit. then regret it later when it's all over :)"}
{"text":"Bought 2 burger combo from Groupon and had the burger tonight. Very disappointed. Burger is very blend. Five guys, hero burger are definitely better than Fatburger."}
{"text":"Night crew sitting around too lazy to work. Why is the open sign on at midnight?  Why are posted hours till 1am. Bad franchise owner obviously doesn't care"}
{"text":"The burger and fries completely blew me away. The quality of food was just way above what my expectations were when I walked in. However, I did come to this location on a Saturday to try it out and ended up just walking out since I saw 6 people sitting down at tables but told me I had to get in line behind them. Yes, these people were sitting down because they did not get their order in standing up. One guy even had his feet on a chair. Seeing that made me realize that I was better off going somewhere else. Not sure if they were understaffed but it appears they were overwhelmed with a few customers that they couldn't get to anyone else.

The day I did go, the staff had fun while working with each other but they seemed fairly aloof and detached in regards to customer service and interaction.

The food was so good, I'm willing to try another location. But I felt like I was being treated by McDonalds or Walmart employees while here."}
{"text":"Yum! I love the Turkey Burgers here!! The food is always great and service is incredible. Totally worth paying $12 for a turkey combo."}
{"text":"Visited this place on Sunday after receiving numerous recommendations from my Co-Workers, charming place, if somewhat busy (not a bad thing though, busy means successful!)

Ordered the Big Fat One, didn't take too long for it to arrive, was actually surprised to see that they bring it to your table! Nice to have bottomless sodas in the meal too, big fan of having lemon slices in my drinks so it was pleasant to see they had that on hand too. 

The meal itself, the burger was fantastic, I love having mayo in my burgers and the burger as a whole tasted decent, though it was over far too soon, the fries...

*sigh* Canada, you just can't make good chips. Sorry! 

All in all. I'd deffo go again, probably order a caesar salad instead of the fries. Maybe get a milkshake too!"}
{"text":"Burgers are excellent with a lot of condiments to choose from. However...there's always a decent wait and they're pretty expensive. Overpriced in my opinion but I'll definitely be going back next payday lol."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what more one could want if a fat burger with the works, American cheese, bacon and a fried egg doesn't do it for you.  I can tell you that's the only way to go.  Add a chocolate shake if you game."}
{"text":"We had a groupon for two menu items and a pitcher of margaritas. We went for lunch, sat at the bar and had a great time. Our bartender was nice and fast. The drinks were great and really, how could you go wrong with burgers?

We made a memory we won't soon forget. Sitting on the strip, a nice sunny day, with a margarita and new friends. Doesn't get better than that, especially when you are coming from snowy subartic Chicago."}
{"text":"I ordered the smallest burger on the menu, and it was still pretty big. Good thing I didn't add any fries to my order, otherwise I really would have felt guilty afterwards. 

It gets better as you eat. Although the meat could be a bit juicier, there's a nice charbroiled flavor to the whole thing. I think they forgot to add cheese on mine, but the mayo made up for it. 

Good place for a quick burger fix!"}
{"text":"Love Fatburger and this particular location is great.  I happen to live within the district so it's really tempting not to eat here every day haha.

THAT BEING SAID.  For the better part of this year, the guy working the register during the graveyard shift needs to be let go.  Every single time I go past midnight, this short guy gives tons of attitude to my friends and me.  He seems irritated every time anyone comes to order.  Why is he still there?  Why is he being paid to essentially \"man the post\" .  Even though it says twenty four hours, it is ultimately up to him.  I have been there at 3:30am and he has taken our orders under duress. Another time went there at 2am and he REFUSED to make burgers altogether.  I inquired \"I thought the sign says 24 hours\" to which he replied \"If the sign ain't lit, it don't mean shit\". 

I also want to mention, I am a good tipper and always make sure to make sure to take care of the crew, especially during late hours such as these.  

Now I can completely understand business being slow and not wanting to fire up the grill or shake machine, but it was a SATURDAY NIGHT and to refute with such an attitude is truly appalling.  I will definitely be making a complaint about this man to corporate but until he's gone, be aware.  As long as this guy is running the burger stand, this Fatburger is NOT 24 hours.  

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Very fresh burgers . You can really tell they made it all fresh just for you. Little pricey but fresh ingredients ain't cheap. 
Burger on point ."}
{"text":"Fat Burger rocks.  Definitely my favorite fast food joint.  Get a loaded burger with chili...so good.

I put Fat Burger at the top of the list for fast food.  In and Out comes 2nd."}
{"text":"I decided to try FatBurger today and was a little disappointed with the expensive prices and the terrible service at this location to go with it. I ordered a chocolate shake and noticed once I hit the whip cream that it tasted off.  I asked my friend who was there with me to try it as well to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds and sure enough it wasn't. I informed our waitress who just said, \"the whip cream was on today's truck\" and I explained that might be the case; however, it tastes bad, she just rolled her eyes and walked away. I wasn't asking for a new shake I was just asking for someone to look into the situation and apparently fresh quality ingredients are not of concern at this establishment. Overall this place has terrible customer service, the wait was too long with a relatively dead time, and it's too expensive.  I wouldn't recommend this FatBurger location."}
{"text":"Good food, just high as hell.  Could have came out better going to In N Out.  5 stars because the food is great and the quick service is even greater!"}
{"text":"It's an awesome burger joint!!! I always order the XXL burger. This thing is freaking huge! I can only imagine the XXXL lol 

If you need a break from Carls jr (my favorite), McDonald's, Jack in da box, etc... this joint is for you.

I put reservations yes. Because you can order online or by phone!"}
{"text":"2 for 1 drinks! Sports on tvs! Lots of tvs! 

There's just this special something with chain restaurants where you know exactly what you're expecting. No complaints here! 

Staff are very accommodating and nice. Woo hoo!"}
{"text":"Best Milkshakes EVER!!!!

Really,when you think you've tried it all, Fatburger comes in and delivers the best shake I've ever had. it's just what you want on a milkshake, real ice cream, hole milk & fresh strawberries,perfect and thick; can't get any better that that.
Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Chedder Bacon cheeseburger, Wow. Open 24 hours!  Made to order.  Great burger joint"}
{"text":"My wife and I grew up with Fatburger in L.A. so we are very familiar with the menu.  We stopped in on our way home from Vegas and I had the Large with cheese, bacon and egg along with fat fries. Best burger I've had in a while. The staff was friendly and aside from feeling like a child having to ask the manager to open the restrooms it was a very pleasant experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't get how they claim to be the 'Last Great Burger Stand', but whatever. 
The staff at this location were super friendly, and I find it hilarious the way they process orders. The cashier yells, 'veggie burger with yam fries', and you hear the staff repeat in unison 'veggie burger with yam FRIESSS!!!', very enthusiastically. Very cute. I was impressed with my veggie burger, it didn't look like much. A brown patty with pieces of what look like mixed frozen vegetables inside. Not the best veggie burger, but still good. I could have done without the massive fluffy bun it came with.
My food was fresh and the yam fries were hot, and crispy, and not greasy. It came with a chipotle sauce, which complimented it nicely and didn't just taste like spicy mayonnaise I find many other burger joints have.
When finished, I went to carry my tray to teh garbage, but one staff member rushed towards me and said 'oh, no, no, no, don't worry about it'. And picked my tray and took it to the garbage. The same garbage I would have taken it to myself...it was nice, and definitely adds to the great customer service, but I feel bad when people clean up after me, I am an adult after all.
Anyways, this place is much better to me than Five Guys, and cleaner and less greasy."}
{"text":"Stopped here with a Groupon and SUPER glad I did.  2x 50oz frozen drinks with fries was the groupon deal I go but added a burger since me and the BF were hungry.  Sat at the bar immediately with no wait and a super friendly bar staff.  Super chill environment with great music that took me back to high school in SoCal circa 1996.  If you want a great burger and great drinks in a laid back place, Farburger is the joint to hit up. Farburger, love the burgers, drinks, music, and tattoos!"}
{"text":"Being a California native, I didn't try Fatburger until we moved to Vegas. Sad, eh? I'm so glad I finally tried this place! love LOVE their burgers and fries. 

So, it's looks are deceiving. It looks closed due to the lack of customers whenever I pass by. But they are open! We visit this place about once a month, as a treat. The staff is always super nice and chill. The burgers are always cooked to perfection and put together neatly with the fixins! I usually order the small fat with skinny fries. I have tried the onion rings, and they were delicious, but it started to be too much to eat after I finish a delicious fatburger. 

I learned that this chain is in each Station casino, minus Boulder Station. I haven't visited those locations. I'm really glad this location isn't too far from our apt. :) They have a frequent visitor card thing. You get a stamp for each fatburger you purchase, and it's double stamps on Tuesdays. Fill up a card and you get a free Fatburger! I haven't read the fine print, but I'm saving our full cards for a lazy day :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  They were passing out 2 for 1 drink coupons on the street outside of this restaurant, so I decided to go in and have a burger and a couple of beers.  I ordered the half pound burger expecting a nice thick pub style patty. What I got was two thin burgers stacked on top of each other. That was my first mistake. The bill for my \"buy one beer - get one free\" was $7.00 (for a PBR). Total rip-off. There are lots of good places to eat on this part of the strip. Avoid Fatburger!"}
{"text":"The first thing that you notice is that the food is overpriced.
Then you taste it.
The worst burger I have ever had. And that comes from a lifelong experience with burgers. I would never, ever give it a second chance. It was greasy, fatty, flavorless, and metallic.
The fries mirrored the burger.  An awful dining experience.
This place is perched on the lowest rung. Lower than the corner greasy spoon.
Steer far, far away from Fatburger. You have many other choices for burgers and fries, and they are all better than this place."}
{"text":"Best burger! Added patio with dj and Gogo dancers at night-the water misters outside are nice in the heat"}
{"text":"Awesome bar outside of the madness of the strip,   The pizzas are amazing as well as the burger selection,    Big doors open the restaurant up to a nice outside breezy setting.    The servers and bartenders are all friendly,  these are reasons why I'm in there once a week,"}
{"text":"Ok I used to love fat burger, but this location is horrible... my bf was looking thru his burger and found a ROACH leg in it... I argued that it wasn't a roach leg, but then I looked it up on my phone it definitely was a roach leg.. so he complaint to the cook an he said it was relish 1st of all relish is green the leg was redish brown... anyways this place looks filthy... YUCK"}
{"text":"For the most part, FatBurger does an ok job with their food and drinks. In fact they are pretty decent about making sure that everything you get is on par with many of the other locations both in NV and Cali. 

For some reason this location just misses the point! Now, I understand it is in a high volume area, with heavy foot traffic and etc. Catering to tourist who probably will not come back, but regardless of who comes into eat, Consistency & Quality is key!  

Meat-overcooked
Bun-A little stale
Produce-Not very fresh-BK & Mr. Jack-had better. 
Extra items?-Actually paid extra for something I didn't get! I know stupid me! 
Overpriced food, drinks, and etc. 

Go to \"In-n-Out\" a few blocks away, if your really dying for a egg in your burger, go up the street to Fireside, I know they'll do it right! 

Cheers."}

{"text":"We will not be back...We dined at the Seton location...The burger was extremely salty...For a $10+ burger, I expect the gourmet standards..However, this is far from it.They claim the patty was never frozen...Unfortunately, they apparently pressed it when cooking..so all the juice escaped...We won't be back..."}
{"text":"I have eaten at fatburger several times and found the burger tasty and a decent price.  The have 3 kinds of french fries, steak, thin and curly and now that I think about maybe regular!  They serve quick even though they are usualy crowded.  You can go from a third pound all the way to a 24 ounce burger, now thats a hamburger.  If you try it you will not be disappointed.  \"The Truth\"  Ciau!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me .60 extra  for a piece a cheese on an already overpriced burger, $1.00 extra for curly fries is it just me or should they call this \"sucker burger. The staff looked like extras from the movie Scarface with manners to match . Save your money and go to In-N-Out, Five Guys, or better yet for the same money at \"sucker burger\" you could be treated like a real person with your delicious burger brought to your table at Blu Burger in North Scottsdale. FYI ladies my wife said \"no soap\" in restroom."}
{"text":"i really liked fatburger for burgers. they were good burgers but i'm only giving it 3 stars. i prefer five guys and give them 4 stars so i have to give them 1 less. its a burger so nothing too special but still a good burger. nothing else really to say about it"}
{"text":"PLEASE SKIP OUT ON THIS LOCATION! The workers were uninterested, had an underlying attitude, the food took 25 minutes to make, and in the end wasn't even that good. I've been to other Fatburgers and they were great."}

I went here using a Groupon and I wish I could get my money and my time back.  It was the worst tasting hamburger ever.  It is very overpriced and I will never go here again.  It took everything in me to eat most of my hamburger (only because I am not a fan of wasting food).  Usually when a person is hungry just about anything taste good.  When I arrived here I was starving and I still could not finish it.  I will not be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"Only giving 3 stars because the food is so delicious and staff was friendly. But the menu is way overpriced, even for a casino. Plus, there were only 2 people working on a busy holiday weekend. It took way too long for just a burger and chili fries. The staff was doing the best they could so I don't blame them. This is definitely a management issue. This burger joint has been here for a long time, they should know it is going to be busy 4th of July weekend. However, the burger was delicious as always and chili fries were excellent."}
{"text":"Better than most other burger places in the area. I actually prefer them over Five Guys. They brought the food I ordered on time, the burger was cooked to perfection, well done and not missing anything I asked for. Very friendly service and the girls who work at the cashiers provide a cool atmosphere to the place which makes it even better. I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Burgers are top notch.  Wait is longer than I expect.

Girl prepares the burger with a plastic glove on one hand which she uses to wipe the table etc!!  Then she proceeds to put the burger together with the same glove on.  Drops the pickle, picks it up and puts it on the burger.  WTH!!

So management has figured out how to put together a good burger but cleanliness and protocol is not their thing.

If you order there, watch them like a hawk.  That dirty glove's going on your food."}
{"text":"The Fatburger in Chase Field is exactly what you'd expect from a Fatburger; totally worth the wait.  Located in the Left Field concourse, it's easy to spot and if you have a ticket for upstairs, there are no restrictions to enter the lower level.

I enjoyed my Fatburger but I would have rather had a table and a chair as opposed to a high-table.

Service was good and the price was comparable to the other Fatburger's even though it was inside a ballpark.  The pop was clean, as in it didn't have that overly syrupy taste like they don't clean out the lines."}
{"text":"a transcendent burger experience. so greasy, so much, so wonderful.

the perfect (preventative) cure for a hangover."}
{"text":"I really think it depends on who is working the grill, as i have eaten here 3xs in the last 3 weeks with mixed results. If it is slow that is ur best bet.  They have a chocolate sunday lots of good ice cream for $2.99..pretty good!"}
{"text":"Concept is great, liked the value, burgers were cooked to well done. Maybe it's a Midwest thing but we'll done! I know medium rare isn't always an option but health code can be met long before the meat is dry and crunchy. Not sure if it's policy or an individual cook...won't go back to find out."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken wings! Great price! Best spot in town for a craving. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and consulted me Yelp as I do sometimes and landed at Fatburger. Joint was squeaky clean but has a weird geometry, way narrow way too long. Maybe four or five patrons were there at one o'clock Saturday. Staff are attentive. Huge menu, takes a while to read through. Once you order they give you a number sign that you place on your table and then they'd bring your order in less than ten minutes. Burgers we tried were heavily spiced, they were okay though. Nacho fries was extremely salty and loaded with pepper, their poutine had so much salt in it you would instantly feel your blood pressure rising. Three burgers with fries and pop came close to fifty bucks. Not very tempted to come back again"}
{"text":"Disappointment in a bun. After paying $20 for a subpar burger that was more grease than burger, and fries that tasted like paper, I became quickly disappointed. You'd think this is an alternative to Five Guys Burgers & Fries; hell no, even McDonalds tasted better."}
{"text":"Hold the salt.  Burger made in edible because of way too much seasoned salt on the mushroom Swiss. Fries are no better than average. Store is dirty. No reason to return"}
{"text":"Not cheap, sub par burgers.

I'd been to another Fat Burger one in SoCal and I didn't think anything of it: it wasn't good and it wasn't bad. The FB at this location, I'd another matter. Located inside of the Fiesta Henderson casino, this restaurant is staffed by two people and pumps out (I'd guys) about 5 burgers an hour because business is slow.

The food is hot because it's made fresh every time. But it's tasteless and bland. The relish that they use is  Tammy, sour and sweet all at the same time: not my taste. The skinny fries were pretty good. A large burger with fries cost me $11+; not cheap and not worth the money.

I do not recommend this particular location. Frankly, I'm not about to visit Fat Burger (any location) any time soon."}
{"text":"Always liked Fatburger, the traffic at this location seemed slow, but the service was still exceptional."}
{"text":"What better to start to whittle away a hangover like something called a King Burger at 4am?

Please note that this review was done after an all night drinking bender. 

When you stroll into fat burger, its like visiting an old school hamburger place. All the food is cooked to order and they make no attempt to disguise what there selling you....from fat fries to a fat drink, you know that whatever you consume will have enough fat to kill a rhino.

But as with most things in life even though its terrible for you, its delicious. The wait time kind of sucks, but the wait is worth getting something that doesn't resemble a hockey puck a la McDonald's. 
Its also a little on the expensive side with two meals running me about $27 bucks, which for a burger and fries is a little much.

Overall this place is OK, nothing too special though."}
{"text":"Burger was okay, price a little steep for what I'm used to, but still a decent price. The service was lacking because when I went there and ordered, it felt like I was almost a disturbance or an annoyance to them....."}
{"text":"Cashier was very rude, came in with Groupon voucher and on Groupon it said they're location would take it. Well anyways, I came in and told her we had a voucher, she told me \" NO YOU DON'T\" ..like I'm pretty sure I do. But she just gluntly told me no.

And I dont understand how people on groupon have reviewed this place if the SUPPOSEDLY dont accept it..??"}
{"text":"I won't knowingly eat at a place where the people entrusted to prepare my food are lazy clock-punchers--nor would I eat where the staff has their ass on the serving counter. I dig the Fatburger franchise as a whole (I've reviewed the Sunset Station location favorably). This place is at Sunset and Mountain Vista, in front of the Wildfire. I sat in the drive through at this location for 3 full minutes today (I use my watch to time drive through response time--just a habit to overcome the boredom) with no response. No big deal. So I pulled up to look through the drive through pickup window. Maybe they were closed and I didn't notice. Perhaps the intercom was broken. Maybe they were being held up by robbers and I could foil a crime!!! Nope. When I pulled up and looked in, I saw two employees, one sitting on the counter (where food is supposed to be served), one sitting in the dining room, both looking at their cell-phones. There were no customers visible inside. I'm hoping there was no manager inside either, or else that location is in real trouble if one of those loafers was actually in charge. Lazy is one thing; I can nearly forgive some young person for not giving their all for a minimum wage fast food job. But sitting on the checkout counter? Oh, hell no."}
{"text":"Located in Sunset Station Casino, this Fatburger has always served me decent food with good customer service."}
{"text":"Killer burgers! Not cheap, but the best fast food burger around, I prefer it to In n Out. Real ice cream milkshakes as well, that are excellent. They have added an outdoor patio/bar  for the strip location- now its even better!"}
{"text":"Love FatBurger but this place is FILTHY.  Go to Wild Horse Casino or Mesa restaurants."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at Fatburger in a long time. Tonight I stopped here and ordered the XXL burger with chili and cheese. There was not much of a crowd which was good and the food didn't take very long to get to me, maaaybe 10 minutes.

Anyway, I just demolished this burger and it was absolutely delicious. Far superior to a double double and you don't have to wait all day for the food to come. As for cleanliness, while I was there the manager (I assume) had an employee cleaning the inside of the window tracks and the rest of the restaurant was pretty spotless too."}
{"text":"It's a step up from In-n-out as far as burgers go. They take more time to cook them, offer more toppings, use high quality ingredients, and are a little pricier than your fast food joint. You also have to wait longer if you go in at a busy time, but that's because they ares small and not very well known. If you wanna save a few bucks grab a stamp card and get punching."}
{"text":"I'm from the East Coast, so I initially became acquainted with Fatburger after listening to a rap song by the Notorious B.I.G a number of years back.  I don't believe Fatburger can be found back in the Northeast, so when I came to visit Las Vegas, I had spotted Fatburger and wanted to try it.  Prices are a tad expensive on the Strip, but that's to be expected.  However, I didn't think that Fatburger was over the line in terms of price.  Fatburger allows you to order a burger with plenty of different toppings, all which makes a burger tasty and unique.  Not a perfect burger joint, but definitely a good burger joint to patronize."}
{"text":"fat burger fat is the new skinny.. oh shud up! like that's ever gonna happen,i was craving a for a yumy vegetarian burger?i dont know how much did my bf pay for that stupid burger that wasnt even yummy,but i feel like apologising to him,for making him pay for that burger,which wasnt yummy at all,hello? please find some better vegetarian patty recipes? there's heaps out there... learn one from BURGer FUel New Zealand! they make the yummiest vegetarian burgers.. anyway.. waste of money and time.

{"text":"I got the 1lb burger with everything but relish and mustard and what can I say it's greasy goodness! I went to Holsteins yesterday and their burgers had a refined taste but if you want a classic American burger and atmosphere this is the place. I got the fries too but they tasted like frozen fries from the store;not great. Overall I would call this a five guys on steroids! (Excluding the fresh cut fries)"}
{"text":"The Burger reminds me of cafeteria burgers from junior high school.

I got it with extra egg, which was dry and scrambled.  Almost as dry as the Burger meat.

Over $10 and it was one of the worst burgers I've ever had in my life.

Also the workers were cleaning the floor right next to my table while I was eating.  Very unprofessional and not considerate.  

Restrooms are locked and you need to ask for a key.

Do not come here.  Ever."}
{"text":"burgers are awesome!!! having said that, don't come here with the wife and kids (some folks are dumb enough to do so) at 1am or 2am in the morning!! you will get \"propositioned\" for some after hours fun from some pretty nasty looking, um, howdoyasay?? ladies of the night? whatever, i'll say it hookers.... wife, kids or not!! awkward! 

The flavor in the beef patty's is to die for..... very unhealthy of course, but hey, after  getting drunk and losing or winning some money in the casino's..... comfort food will make you feel, well comfortable! 
a must stop if you are in Vegas or Henderson, NV."}

{"text":"Only have service complaints 

I sat at the bar outside and waited on my burger for 40min the sweet waitress kept trying to update us on the food but this wasn't her fault It's the cooks, on Thursday night in Vegas wasn't even super busy 
Good thing I was drunk a had cigarettes to kill time 


Food was great nothing too special about it just a simple burger joint"}
{"text":"A good solid burger place.  The burger and fries are a solid cut above fast food but just off the level of a dedicated burger joint like five guys.  That said they have great assortment on the menu with probably some of the best chicken fingers I've had that get breaded in store before your eyes.  I haven't had the chicken wings yet but from what I've seen they look great."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  I would never eat here again.  Gary and I went to Mill on Sunday.  We wanted to go to the bookstore and to try someplace new. 

When we walked in, he said, let's go, I don't want to eat here.  But I said, no, let's give it a chance, it's always packed on the weekends.  

I ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings...  they were out of onion rings and lettuce... so I ended up with a cheeseburger and cheese fries.  Gary had the Bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and chilli cheese fries. 

We got our food, the hamburger bun was old, stale, rock hard... which pretty much ruined the whole sandwich.  The cheese on my cheese fries was not melted.  They forgot the tomato in Gary's sandwich.

The guy at the counter didn't understand English and I couldn't understand him, so ordering was quite the complicated procedure.  

A few hours later my stomach was hurting so much.  I thought I was going to die... and spent the night throwing up.

I will never eat here again, and I may even listen to Gary when he says let's go some place else."}
{"text":"I love Fatburger! Could it be because this is where I had my first date with my husband? Or is just because the burger are ginormous and always so yummy? I will go with----both.  I tried the chili for the first time this last visit and it was awesome.  I like it on my fries--I added it myself, I didn't order chili cheese fries.  My husband ordered the Diamondback double burger (or something like that) this thing was huge! But we were both satisfied customers who left with full bellies and a desire to come back.  

Side Note: It smells like onions inside and sometimes the smell is so strong it literally makes your eyes water."}
{"text":"They had a cook taking orders I couldn't donate to breast cancer because he didn't know how to ring it up then the food was over price I loved my milk shake the food was not so great remind me of why I stop eating there in first place"}
{"text":"Had different hamburgers here several times and this place is a cruel joke. First of all, the burgers are way overpriced with their original/main burger setting you back $8 plus $2 extra for a stinking slice of cheese (WTF!), I guess some people enjoy a good ol' Canadian rip-off. All that could be forgiven if the quality was there, but hell no it's not there. For the third straight time, I'm faced with a soggy bun and an unpleasant tasting/stinking and dry beef patty, so regardless of it's thick size, the taste is BLAND and the texture god-awful, akin to eating gravel. The vegetables are fine, but the main attraction is AWOL. Combine this with the horrible prices, the disingenuous, overly-friendly and obviously programmed/scripted attitude of the Filipino workers, the 10-15 minute avg. wait time (in an empty restaurant) and this place is  a bad mess.Never again! Dollar for dollar, McDonalds beats this self-acclaimed place (Hamburger's last stand my foot) hands down just for comparison and I dislike McDs quite a bit. Just do yourself a favour and find a Harvey's or even a Wendy's near you and your mouth and wallet will be much happier. Guess some folks in Thornhill are just suckers for \"gourmet\" claims, regardless of the actual quality and the abundance/illusion of choice available. Don't be fooled by the hype and the claims, this place is a definite let down from beginning to end and I really wanted to like it seeing as how it's a 2 minute walk from my place, hence I've given it multiple chances and every time the result was the same - EPIC FAIL!  In rating this place, I'm reminded of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, when Kurtz gasps - The Horror, the Horror! I guess he had a Fatburger from Disera."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger no tomato, checked the screen and it did not have tomato listed.  I got my burger and it had tomato crossed off on the wrapper yet there was a tomato on my burger.  I have a gag reflex if I eat tomatoes or the juice from it, so I went up to the counter and told the girl I ordered no tomato and she asked if I wanted her to take the tomato off.  No, I could have done that myself I told her and that I needed a fresh burger without tomato.  So she told the cook, and both of us had to tell him several times NO tomato because he kept asking \"tomato?\" So they finally get it right and the cook kept looking over at me like he was waiting for me to take a bite.  This made me very suspicious so I ended up throwing it away.  I would not eat at this location again!"}
{"text":"Fatburger is pretty decent. Way too spendy for a fast food burger if ur looking to get all the things u want on a burger. I would go to in and out, smashburger or even the local casinos before hitting up fatburger to be honest. The burgers are pretty big though so I'll give them that!"}
{"text":"Burgers were good.  Were tasty and cooked right.  Only wish it was a little cheaper but one of the better options for food at the diamond backs game"}
{"text":"Fatburger and In-N-Out are my favorite burger joints in Vegas.  Fatburger is more expensive but they have more variety in their menu (yes, I know about animal style and protein style).

The key trick for Fatburger is to get a discount card.  They punch it for every burger you get and when it is full, you get a freebie.  However, you have to ask for their card because they don't volunteer it and they don't ask if you have one.

Skinny fries are better than their steak fries.  Chili is pretty good with chili cheese fries a favorite side.  Onion rings are very good too.  The milkshakes are real old-fashioned shakes (similar but larger serving size to In-N-Out.)

If you eat very late, they are your best choice since they are 24 hours.  Sometimes you have to make some noise if they are in the back instead of manning the register, however.

They are made to order so you can get extra whatever.  The one thing I don't like versus In-N-Out in addition to being more expensive is that they use chopped onions.  You can get a fresh slice at In-N-Out and slices are better than chopped onions because there is less cell wall damage and water leakage.

This location is not as good as some of the other Fatburgers but a mediocre Fatburger is still better than the best McDonald's."}
{"text":"We visited this place after taking the kids to the pool and finding the $32 for $16 groupon.  For an \"order at the counter, sit in the food court\" fast food place, this place is extremely overpriced!!  Some meal combos are over 12 bucks (approaching gourmet burger prices at sit down places with MUCH more ambiance!).  Anyway, our tab ran almost 36 bucks for 3 turkey burgers, 2 fries, 1 shake and two sundaes for the girls.  Good thing we had the groupon to keep it more reasonable.  Of course, with what we got, this place was STILL overpriced after adding in the savings!  Turkey burgers were dry, tasteless and small.  Fries were very unremarkable, our vanilla shake was basically tasteless as well.  I don't know how these places charge as much as they do and still have people frequent them...  What a rip off!!  I will admit that the regular burgers did look pretty good but we were trying to go with somewhat healthier alternatives.  Anyway, if you are after burgers that don't run 40 bucks for a family of four, I think you are MUCH better off at In n Out or Smashburger!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great with excellent options for toppings and sauces. Turkey burger actually has some good seasoning so it's not bland like many turkey burgers can be. Burgers are large so it's a filling meal.  Fries are basic and could be better. Service is friendly and restaurant has a neat old diner decor. We will sure be back!"}
{"text":"Came here @ midnight and was craving a hamburger, got the medium combo deal and it hit the spot, even though the burger had \"the works\", it wasn't as loaded as I would have expected but a great way to get a quick meal on the strip 24/7"}
{"text":"I agree, all the food tastes great, and I love the ambience with all the workers shouting and coinfirming their orders,  Decor is nicer than quick-service.  A bit pricey, but what isn;t these days?"}
{"text":"This sh*t was awesome. I've always been an fb fan, but this time I hot an egg, bacon, and onion rings added. It was delicious. Lily took my order and was very friendly and helpful.  Good meal."}
{"text":"Wow my first review. It's about 10 dollars for a 8oz burger and a small drink at this fast food place. I have a few problems with that. It's not fast. It's expensive for what you get. And you would think if you are the only customer in the place at 4:30 am they could pay enough attention to at least not get your order completely wrong. No wonder I have not been here in months, and won't ever be back again ."}
{"text":"Favorite  burger. Food is always  good, but place seems to be getting run down. Teenagers  running  it never clean the tables."}
{"text":"I pulled into FatBurger this evening and was confronted by a totally new menu. They've changed the names on all their burgers!

The good ole fatburger is gone- now call it a \"medium\". The Kingburger (my fave) is now the \"large\". They're using a t-shirt size theme- like S,M,L,XXL,XXL. Why in hell would they do this?

OK, so anyway, I'm at the sign under pressure to order- I figure the \"XXL\" is what I want figuring that was the old KingBurger. Wrong! Instead of the half pound King, I got a 1lb double burger. 

Well, it was good- usual FatBurger taste just way too much. The meat to toppings/bun ratio was off as I usually get the 1/2 lb single patty (KingBurger)

Who the hell is the middle management doofus who green lighted this name change crap? Why F with a classic formula?

Oh well, Fat fries are still there and the taste hasn't changed- luckily."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for what you get. Not nearly as good as it's hyped up to be. Ate here once and I will not return. There are much better alternatives IMO. Only myself and one other family eating yet the tables were all dirty. No combo deals, you add what you want to your burger and end up paying for each item!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Kids love it that we had to grab some more in LA on the way home. A little bit pricey than a typical burger but worth it. Wish they had one in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"This is the best burger in town. It costs a lot and you have to wait, but it's worth it. If you're tired of frozen pub burgers and fast food banality, Fat Burger is the place to consume delicious, fresh ground beef.
I first tried Fat Burger in Las Vegas earlier this year and was pleased to discover Calgary has one of its own. There is just something real about the burger when you bite into it. It's not like other burgers that feel flat or like they'll disintegrate before they reach your belly. You can tell the difference just by holding a double fat burger with cheese. It's actually HEAVY. Almost like it's real hamburger. Turns out it is.....
The fries are good too and you can have an expensive Canadian draught to wash it down.
Costly, but without a doubt, the most tasty burger in town."}
{"text":"Great burgers and atmosphere. Enjoyed sitting outside  on the strip to eat. They also had all of the football games on the tv's. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Just OK. I think it is a little bit pricy for the quality. It reminds me of an expensive In-N-Out. I liked the topping choices, and I liked the fry choices. I had a medium burger and fat fries! Wait time was a little long for a dead afternoon, but the burger was satisfying."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!

This place is a joke.  You pick what size of over-priced hamburger patty you want.  $5 to $10 for a fast food burger? Really?!?!?

When I pulled into this place, there was a blue car at the drive thru window.  I pulled up to the speaker to order and was told \"Just a minute.\"   5 minutes later, the order taker graced me with her presence and I gave my order.  I pulled up and the blue car was still there!  I waited another 4-5 minutes and just pulled out of the drive thru and left.  The exact same thing happened about a year ago when I first tried this location.  

I will never, ever go to Fatburger again.  Terrible service.  Over-priced food and an overall lack of caring.  

F-

Stay Away!"}
{"text":"Worst experience!
We sat and ate here. The service was ok but their chicken sandwich was absolutely terrible. I'm not a fan of McDonalds but their dollar menu sandwich is probably better than this $7 something piece of tasteless food.
Never going back."}

{"text":"Tried it first time last night.  Originally intended to go to South Street Burger but went to Fatburger since I was in the area.

Ordered 2 Original Fatburgers; one yam fries; one onion rings. Total with tax came to $25.  Did not order drinks since I was taking them home.  Not cheap.

The patties are large but I didn't find them to be much better than Wendy's. The quantity of the sides aren't that generous for $4 each.

I'm going back to South Street Burger.  I think their patties taste better and denser (and flame broiled instead of cooked on a griddle).

Fatburger tastes too much like a regular fast food burger.  Too expensive for that quality."}
{"text":"Very slow service (was in a line of 5 people and it took over 15 minutes at the slushee bar). Little if any alcohol in the slushee."}
{"text":"Good burger for the first time eating here.I ordered the half lbs burger.nice and warm for January.stuffed"}
{"text":"It's the little things I like about FatBurger... you know how most fast food places give you what - like, one packet of ketchup, maybe two - then give you that gluttonous pig look if you ask for more? Well, there's a bucket on the counter at FatBurger. Take all you want. Nice. And there are napkin dispensers on every table. Nothing like making a mess and having to first get up and walk across the room to be able to clean it up.

I avoided FatBurger for years because, well, it's called FatBurger. Didn't figure they'd serve anything besides meat. Most burger places don't. But ever since a friend of mine introduced me to their veggie burger a while back - a seriously thick Boca patty on a whole wheat bun - I now stop by once a month or so to get my veggie burger fix. Coming in around nine bucks for a meal deal with fries and a drink it's definitely a little pricy for fast food, but I have to admit - it is that much much better. Burgers are loaded up with fresh toppings, and the fries are delicious - thick & crisp (and generous portions). Never tried a shake, but I heard they're good."}
{"text":"It's no Lenny's, but it is a good burger.  From time to time I stop in here when I need a good quick burger and the line at In and Out across the street is too long.  I always forget about it being here, though, because Chipotle and Jamba Juice usually grab my attention first. 

Easy to get to location right off of the 202."}

{"text":"Friendly service but food was blah. Even with a groupon I didn't get what I paid for. Burger patty too thick and flavorfless. Buns old. Fries stale and old. Very upset as this location charges more than the usual simply bc it's in a casino."}
{"text":"I had been craving a Fat Burger for about two weeks and finally decided to give in. I was surprised when I got there that I was the only customer there. It was about 2pm and maybe that had something to do with it. There were two people working there and both were very friendly. I ordered the Large Combo. That is 1/2 pound of meat. It did not take very long to get my food at all. As a matter of fact it was brought to my table.

The burger was flavorful and tender, and had the right amount of crust around the edge. It was also very juicy and cooked just right. Each and every fry was golden brown and had a nice crunch to them. I just hate under cooked fries and these were not. These were wonderful. I did love the food here, but I left off one star because of the decor. It is just another fast food restaurant as far as that goes. It was clean though."}
{"text":"Great food. Worst service of all time.  They rarely get it right. Root Beer float ordered 3 times in 3 visits. Meal came without float twice got it 15 minutes later after asking. Once float came without meal. Had to request meal 15 minutes later."}
{"text":"The worst burger joint I ever visited. The casino is nice but the fat burger is disappointing.  Long lines, sit down area is poorly cleaned. The food is generic and not up to the fat burger standards."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say. It's a burger. It's fat. It's a FAT BURGER!!

You have a huge appetite get the XXL with all the fixings and then some.


This is one of my fist stops when in Vegas or Los Angeles areas. By far my fave burger joint, EVER!"}
{"text":"While the bartender was easygoing and generous with the booze, his banter was canned and generic, just like his hair. He assumed we didn't want change when we handed him a $20 for a bar tab of $11."}
{"text":"When I feel like having a good old fashioned hamburger, this is where I go.  It's just a good, juicy hamburger, and they do it right.  Love that you have a choice between steak fries or skinny fries, and both are good.  Their chili is also decent, and goes well with their fries or on their burgers.  I like that they give you a list of everything they put on your burger, so that you can pick and choose.  Also, handmade milkshakes, yum."}
{"text":"We came here to eat on the morning after a heavy night of drinking =P. I ordered the spicy chicken burger and some onion rings. I must say, it was a very good burger. But I agree with with MJ B., this isn't In-N-Out. But it was nice to have some onion rings though.

I was still pretty hung over, so I didn't have that big of an appetite. But it was goood! Plus, it was across the street from Monte Carlo. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"4 stars for FB. 
Fat burger is super. I always order mine with extra chili and walk out happier. 
Until the day IN-N-OUT decides to come to Calgary, Fat Burger will have my  undivided love for sure."}
{"text":"A solid place to get a freshly prepared burger. I like their onion rings also."}
{"text":"Fresh good quality beef and affordability on the strip.  Man very good burgers, Fat fries are great.  I highly recommend for a burger fix.  You can even get a fried egg on you burger, if your so inclined."}
{"text":"I had found Fatburger on Yelp! while I was looking for a place to have dinner before a movie in Sunridge. I love burgers and I love them even more when they are thick and meaty. And Fatburger had just that.

I found it be a bit confusing when ordering. Although their website says they have combos, I dont think its what Id consider a combo (combo means getting a deal by buying all together as a meal) because I felt like I was paying for each thing (the burger, fires and the drink)

The food was amazing though. I was more than pleased with the amount of food given (considering what you pay for it) and the taste was very good. My boyfriend tried their shake and it was SO GOOD! I was kicking myself for not getting one it was that good."}
{"text":"Nice to have this location at Green Valley. It's my favorite place at the food court!

Surprisingly fast service with friendly staff and great burgers. Lives up to the Franchise reputation."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in Toronto, beats five guys burgers hands down and much cheaper too with the groupon deal. Surprisingly the service was also top notch for a burger joint, the cashier/waitress will actually check up on you and remove the plate when you're done! They should have a tip jar but I wasn't aware of any yet. Also unlimited refills for drinks!"}
{"text":"Tried it twice, the \"original fatburger\" and I can safely say it's not my favorite burger place at all. Almost as expensive as 5 guys but has nowhere near the same taste. Burger was almost tasteless. Not to mention how dry the burger was (not enough sauces i guess). The pickles were too salty and the bun was crumbling apart. I couldn't even finish the burger because of how displeasing the taste was."}
{"text":"The burger tasted like cardboard and broke in pieces
The food was brought without the drink which i had to take it myself
No sorry or any other comment from the server
Worst place ever and will not come back"}
{"text":"This place deserves 0 stars!!!
Take heed to the reviews as they are true.
Ordered a cheeseburger, medium with no bun, via postmates.
The burger arrived overdone & like there was an attempt to scrape the cheese off the patty.
As far food presentation goes, everything looked as if it was tossed in the box with no construction at all!!!
Never again! I used to love Fat Burger, I'll be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ate here during lunchtime rush (12:15). They had 2 employees working. One cashier and one cook. Their computer system is so old they can't split cash and card for the customer in front of me. 
We were told it would 10-13 minutes to get our food. It was nearly an hour later that we received our orders. The place was dirty, ketchup was empty, ketchup packets gone too. 
I'm not returning here simply because the place was so dirty and unsanitary. Horrible!"}
{"text":"I ordered a lo carb burger WRAPPED in Lettuce with other assorted topping s  - Received assorted toppings NOT wrapped in lettuce , in fact lettuceless .

Ordered 2 small burgers for my kids cheese only - received 2 small burgers with the works .

it's NOT rocket science it just take a little PRIDE to do that job right .  Mind you I was the ONLY customer in the drive-through and NO cars in the lot .    Now I have 2 STILL hungry kids and basically a meatloaf I have to eat with a fork and knife .  Won't be going back .

If 5 guys only had a drive through !"}
{"text":"If you don't mind getting really fat and try their really, really fat burgers (they have four different sizes), then this is a good place for you. Service was okay and we thought there were really a lot of ingredients (okay for the money) in our fat burgers and extremely fresh also."}
{"text":"25 min wait for burger and fries @ 10:30 pm on a Thursday night?? Fries were cold and the burger overcooked.  Won't do this again."}
{"text":"Wow!  If you eat veggie burgers but feel reminiscent for a sloppy, meaty- looking burger experience; check out the veggie burger with cheese n mushrooms. Filling, fun to eat and tasty. Not cheap, but worth the treat."}
{"text":"First time at a Fatburger in Canada :) Pretty sweet place, really good burgers with decent prices. Ordered burgers x2 and fries with gravy."}
{"text":"My cousin really wanted to try it so we did. Eh... I've tasted much better burgers. It was not worth the money and the wait. 

I asked for medium but the burger came out really dry, their fries are super salty and their shakes were kind of watery."}
{"text":"Great Burgers! Tasty fries! Chicken tenders are good too. Have all kinds of shakes that I've yet to try.  Ask for the BIG FAT CLUB CARD to earn a complimentary item. (This is a loyalty card) Read the fine print. You likely will not leave hungry. Many beverages available including beer. The tables sparkle."}
{"text":"I came in as a stop from cali with my girlfriend. The satff was excellent!!! The girl with the tats were really friendly. Loved the food thank you!!"}
{"text":"When I lived in California, Fatburger was everywhere and the chain is popping up here and there in Canada.   Your satisfaction will probably depend on which location you choose.  For this review, I ate at the one in Bankers Hall with my husband and friend.  Cali burger, gooped with Gauc, and Gauc was about all I could taste even though there was bacon and mozzarella included in my stack 'o fat.  Service staff forgot all of the condiments on my bun, which probably attributed to the one flavour wonder.  The men ate BBQ burgers, both found them a bit sweet and had nothing remarkable to say about the patty, \"kinda bland\" was how my husband described the meat.  Fries were crisp and golden but, again,  lacked any flavour power to them.  If you're looking for a tasty burger with the works for a fraction of the cost, try Five Guys instead, loads of flavour but you'll need a shower when you're finished eating, and probably a shunt for your arteries.  Speaking of US hamburger chains....when is In and Out going to visit us? Double double and a choco.milk shake, deeeelish!"}
{"text":"It was my first time going to Fatburger to be honest it doesn't get better than most of the hamburger restaurants out there but when I ordered the burgers they were expensive and not as good as I expected it to be probably come here a few more times"}
{"text":"Great burgers, I wouldn't say they're over the top best, but they sure are good."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Fat Burger.. My honey and I both ordered med. burgers with skinny fries and onion rings. They were all sooo good. Everything was extra hot when they served it to us! Hands down the best burger joint in Vegas!! ;-)"}
{"text":"Not a bad place overall. I think the burgers are just as good as anybody can make them. It doesn't take a scientist to make a burger. I do like that it's made from sratch and stuff. You get to pick your own topings and stuff. I think it was like $1.00 for cheese.

I didn't have a beer or booze, it was all food. 

It's pricey because of the location, but it's not going to cost you an arm and a leg. So if you really are in a need for a burger, and your on the stripe, I guess this is the place to go to, that or Denny's."}
{"text":"Great price and value for their food. Their burgers are tasty and you can customize them any way you want. Their chili-cheese fries are awesome as well. Are open all night which is a good bonus. Friendly staff as well. Would recommend to anyone looking to crash a food stop on the strip."}
{"text":"Great food, special ed staff. Came here only because I purchased a groupon but I feel cheated : After the girl rang up my credit card for the full amount instead of the groupon amount they then messed up my order. Kinda of hard to enjoy my meal when I feel fucked over."}
{"text":"I typically use the drive-thru and can expect to wait about 5-10 minutes before I get my burger combo and go. The food has always been good and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fat burger does not have the hype of other specialty burger establishments. But if truly an authentic signed burger joint. May I recommend the turkey burger."}
{"text":"The person taking my order was rude she rolled her eyes at me when I told her my id was back in my room. I will never come here again!! When getting food for my son I shouldn't feel like I'm a bother to them when they should be doing their job!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this one. It's very dirty. they messed up my order and the manager actually cussed me and told me to leave... yeah... there's better places to eat than this place."}
{"text":"The food is good, everything is fresh & hot - if they get your order right.  They don't want to know what you want on your burger, they just say to you it comes with lettuce, tomato, onion & mayo really fast and when you say no, I just want ketchup they just don't know what to do.  We have been there many times and I can't say there has been a time where we haven't had to get our order fixed.  Got undercooked bacon one time, eew, ordered gravy, no gravy. They really need to put someone at the register who will listen and enter the right things, maybe they need screens so you can see what is being entered.  Handed me a card with no stamps, sent my husband to get a stamp and said you only get one.  So we should have placed our orders separately to get two stamps.  The other thing that bugs me is they come by every 30 seconds to \"see how everything is\" constantly, it's nice they care but just get the order right.  There is a \"hidden\" review that says the same thing.  I find the menu board hard to read, too much info squished together."}
{"text":"This location is shitty. Just went there at 12:30 when they close at 2 am. They were out of hamburger buns and the soda machine was out of service yet she still took my order and let me pay. In the end I got a refund but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The server was very friendly and patient... I took awhile trying to figure out what I wanted on my burger... and then just ordering pretty much everything. :)  You can watch them grill your patty if you want, giving them directions on how you want it cooked.  I just sat at a nearby slot machine and played for a few minutes before my burger was ready.

I love their burgers!  While it takes a few minutes to cook the burgers, they're still fast food.  And for fast food, their burgers are the best!  The fries are crispy great.  I've never tried their veggie or turkey burgers, but I'm thinking about it... maybe when I get tired of their beef burgers.... ha so probably never."}
{"text":"This location is inside the Green Valley Ranch.
In order for me to review a fast-food restaurant, either food or service must stand out in a HUGE way.
This Fatburger location qualifies in the customer service department.
Here's the story:  
We arrived about 30 seconds after what appeared to be a college baseball team. Sure that we were in for a wait, but dying for burgers and shakes, we get in line.  About 90 seconds later, it's our turn to place our order.  Really.  90 SECONDS.  
We sit at the counter to wait for our food and enjoy the chaos we were sure was about to ensue.
 
Surprise!  We were witness to the most amazingly cheerful team of employees, led by the extremely capable Jocelyn, crank out the 12-14 orders at warp-speed.  This endeavor was executed with such astounding precision that we sat there, mouths agape, in total disbelief.  Jocelyn called out each ballplayer's name with a friendly comment for each, and the total time elapsed from when we placed our order until she called for us, was no more than 5  MINUTES. Wait, Liz, you think, \"impossible.  Fast food employees, generally speaking, can't or won't produce orders so quickly unless accuracy suffers\".  WRONG.  
Not one person returned to the counter for so much as a package of ketchup.
\"Well, Liz, be realistic.  We're talking about hungry young men here.  They don't care about accuracy, they just want to EAT.\"  Possible, I concede.  But our order was perfect.  And delicious.  And fat free.  Well, that's what I choose to believe, anyway.
 
 
Given the apathy that usually engulfs fast food employees resulting in sub-par service and/or product, this group deserves a shout-out for great service and can-do attitudes.  
 
For burgers, fries and shakes, FAST, this places is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"As far as burgers go, this is my absolute favorite place to go. I love the fact that the burgers are made fresh and ginormous! Then order the fat fries (or you can choose shoestring or curly) and you are eating in true American fashion. Don't worry if you don't eat beef they do offer a turkey burger that will keep you coming back. The shakes are an amazing must have and not to mention beer as well. You will leave this placed stuffed for about $11 per person that's including drink, so if you want to go cheap, tasty and all American, go to Fat Burger their amazing"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this location for lunch because I remembered LOVING fat burger when I was a kid. When we walked in and I went on yelp and saw all the bad reviews. I thought \"whatever I'm sure it'll be fine\" I thought wrong. We walk up to order and the cashier was having problems with her register, no big deal. After I had finished ordering and was about to pay I asked for no pickles and relish and she got flustered because she didn't know how to go back on her POS, and said she would just let the cook know herself. We sat down and waited probably 25 minutes for your food... THE PLACE WAS EMPTY! After we got our burger I looked and there was relish and pickles on it. I took it back to the woman who had taken out order and she replies, \"oh yea you're right, so you want a new burger?\" DUH! After waiting another 15-20 minutes for a new one it came out with cheese that I did NOT ask for. At this point I was over the top angry. I haven't ever asked for a full refund before but there was no way I was spending my money on this service. I asked for a refund and the fry cook and cashier got an attitude with me. The casher then refunded me for the burger only and not the fries. I had to show her my receipt and she said, \"oh you want me to refund the fries too?\" She refunded me the fries and we got the hell out of there. I will NEVER go back again."}
{"text":"It took almost an hour for them to make 2 burgers. Worst service I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now - like that you can really customize your burger and the fries or onion rings that go with it.  Also enjoy sitting outside by the fountain or fireplace and that I can take the dog !  But it is a little bit pricey for a burger, so usually only go when I have have a groupon/deal chicken - but it is a good pit stop before a movie.  Don't ask too many questions though as english is a struggle for the cook especially."}
{"text":"Love this burger place! Always great! Takes such a long time  to prepare the burgers though. They are also very pricey! If they were cheaper, and quicker, I would come here so much more!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Do not eat here. Horrible customer service. Got my order wrong, said it was to go and the lady served me my burger as I was waiting like I said it for there. Forgot to give me my cup. There was barely any one in there as it is. Burgers sucked. Worst $20 I've spent on food. Go to In-N-Out instead cheaper and so much better."}
{"text":"This was one of my first experiences at Fatburger and to be completely honest with you I think it is extremely overpriced and every item is sold all a cart but you get what you pay for and at this place you get a big fat juicy burger that is made with a lot of care"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good as usual but the waitress outside at the bar that was serving us was not friendly at all. She seemed annoyed that we were even there and was rushing us."}
{"text":"Parking lot was dimly lit,. Some exterior lights were out. Went inside and there were no lights on the menu. I think I know why. Two combo meals - a turkey burger and a regular hamburger came to $24.00. What?

The only drink available without sugar was Diet Coke. The ketchup dispenser was out of ketchup. Bathroom was not clean at the time I went. Table was sticky. There was an Ice Tea dispenser with four buttons where you could select the flavor you want - except only the Raspberry Ice Tea button actually worked. 

Turkey burger was somewhat tasty. I could not complain, except the patty was a little on the thin side. Most of the flavor came from the sauce and relish however. Fat fries were hot and good. Hamburger was OK, but nothing special. Skinny fries were OK too. I liked the fresh shredded lettuce.

The good point is the burgers and fries were made fresh.Bad point is I just can't justify the price. One gets confused when you can go to a buffet for the price of a franchise chain hamburger.

For the price I paid the place should have been squeaky clean and everything should have been functional.

There is nothing to draw me back here."}
{"text":"Best service since we've been in town. Jorge was on point for sure. We love that we can have great food with superb service.   Thanks Jorge!!"}
{"text":"Big burgers, big prices, fits right into this extravagant city.

I went for the self-seating outdoor bar, famished after a long night.  A quick check of the reviews said that largest size - XXXL - was almost unfinishable due to the size, so I ordered the XXL.  With no bun (paleo!).  And a fried egg.  And bacon.  Because it was technically breakfast.  

There is a bit of a wait, but it was bearable - large burgers grilled to order take a bit of time.

What came out was two huge patties, with the cheese, bacon and egg layered on top, resting on some greens, onions and tomatoes on the side.  Although it looked dry, it was juicy and flavorful.  The egg was cooked to over-hard, which was fine.  The bacon was just okay.  I knife and forked it easily (much easier to eat than In-N-Out's Protein style order).  I finished it all, but it was a lot of food - a very fat burger indeed.

The outdoor seating is enjoyable, more so for the view of the tvs by the bar, and the comely staff.  The people watching is a bit muted, from our time there.  Service is attentive.

If I wanted a gut-bomb of a breakfast/lunch, this could be a place I'd go back too."}
{"text":"My first and last try. I think the meat is tasteless and the tomato was almost green,  Enough said!"}
{"text":"Good fast food burger. I just was ticked off there was nothing else open at a casino (Red Rocks) at 11PM."}
{"text":"I first went to this Fatburger a few months ago when I was in Vegas for a friend's bachelor party.  The burgers are AWESOME, especially for a fast food joint.  I used to think In-And-Out was the hidden fast food burger gem on the west coast...but Fatburger passed them up!  
Fast forward to last week.  I was back in Vegas with a few friends and one of my friends had a Triple King Burger (three 1/2 pound patties).  If you finish this monstrosity, they give you a free t-shirt and take your picture to put up on the wall.  He finished it and got his picture taken.  They were out of t-shirts though.  
A few nights later, we went back.  I ordered a QUAD King Burger (trip-King + 1 extra patty) to one-up my friend.  After consuming TWO POUNDS of delicious hamburger, I instantly regretted my decision.  The burger was awesome (as usual), but I was disgustingly full.  They were still out of t-shirts, and their camera was broken too, but I didn't care.  Right after we left, one of the cooks came outside after me to shake my hand.  I LOVE FATBURGER!"}
{"text":"If you went to Fatburger in L.A. like I used to,you will likely be a bit disappointed. The charm and funky atmosphere have somehow been lost here. 

Pluses: The food is always good. Being able to add an egg or make your order custom is a welcome change. The menu is deliberately limited. This means their core products are spot on and well made. 

Minuses: The current pricing structure leaves a lot to be desired. $20 for 2 people to have burgers and fries is quite steep. The jukebox is gone,but some retro music is still played. Do not be in a hurry here, however long it takes for the food to arrive,is how long it will take. 

Summary: There are a lot of good burger places out there,and many of them are a better value."}
{"text":"Came here and hour before they closed and it took us about 7 mins to finally get our food which isn't bad. But once we got it my friends burger was completely wrong so we had to complain and get it remade. Then that took a little bit more time. So by the time we got that burger back they were trying to rush us so they could clean and get out of work. I'm sorry but I do work in the service industry and that is not good guest service. It's ok I won't be back to this location"}
{"text":"When it takes 25 minutes to make 2 milk shakes to go that's a problem. The cashier didn't seem to happy when I ordered 2 chocolate milkshakes and said \"there's 2 milkshakes ahead of you so\" I mean what the heck? How long does it take to make a milkshake that is the same as Baskin Robbins. Maybe have more than 1 staff member working at this location if it's going to take over 20 minutes to make 2 milkshakes."}
{"text":"This location has some of the best burgers and we have eaten here a few times now. Most of the staff is always really friendly. This time we ate the person named Shannon took my order and seemed very standoffish and not friendly. Should have a better attitude - rest of the staff like I said is very friendly in the afternoon. She wouldn't even look at you while taking the order."}
{"text":"I love fatburger!!

Went here a couple of time during our 2 week holiday in Vegas and couldn't fault it.

Being a veggie I obviously had the veggie burger, so tasty! Boyfriend had the XL burger on his first visit with egg - it was huge! He couldn't finish it and he's had a 1lb burger and a 1/3lb burger in one sitting once in fuddruckers with no problem. But fatburger defeated him!
Chips/fries are great and the oreo milkshake. Only thing is they asked me first time if I wanted whipped cream on top to which I said no, but did't get asked second time. Didn't think anything of it unitl it arrived with a load of cream on top. yikes, not a fan of cream! 

I'm just gutted we couldn't find it on our first night! I had read it was behind the MGM, which it really isn't! So went off in the direction of Hooters looking for it (obviously wrong way!). Being hungry in a new city, which was unbelievably hot is not a good combo when all you've read about for months before going away is fatburger and other similar  burger joints and you just don't want the usual mcdonalds.

If only we had one in the UK!"}
{"text":"I love Fatburger but Be carefull at the Las vegas Strip Fat Burger keep you reciept the employees are scamming customers. I was charged an extra $2.00 to my credit card without my authurization. My friend was charged $9.00 more to her credit card. At the the end of the day I bet the make some serious cash by all the people they rip off. Again keep your recipt. I hope they do something about this but I doubt it...."}
{"text":"Had the XXL Burger which was great. The family also had burgers which they enjoyed. Our order was a little askew as 1 of the kids burgers were plain when we ordered it with cheese. Also we ordered 3 fat fries 1 regular fries. We got 2 fat fries and 2 regular. Our order was to go, was up in our room at Santa Fe Station and wasn't going back down. Food quality was very good! FYI milkshake size is a medium at most fast food places, but very very thick!"}
{"text":"Best thick burger we have had in the Vegas/ Henderson area. Yes it is expensive but not anymore expensive than other burger places with crappy food. Burgers and fries were hot and fresh. We will be back. Thank you to the cook and the staff."}
{"text":"This location is so dirty, i felt sick after eating here.  There was no toilet paper or hand soap in the bathroom...what do they wash their hands with??!!! Just threw up in my mouth thinking of their filthy hands on my burger. Not to mention the sink hasn't been scrubbed in months.  The floors in the restaurant were filthy, along with the windows and walls.  Is there no manager on site?? If there is, you need to find a new career. You have no idea how to run a business.  I'm betting it's not long before they get shut down by the health dept.  DO NOT eat here for your own good!"}
{"text":"Just moved near a location, haven't been to one in a while,  thought I'd give it a shot.  Never again,  service is horrible,  45 min wait in the drive through.  There wasn't anyone in the restaurant ordering to even slow them down. Over priced."}
{"text":"Best burger place in town! It reminds me of a really good Red Robins but without having to have a waiter."}
{"text":"Never going back.  First of all it's way too expensive for the crappy food we received.  The fries were nothing special and tasted worse than the kind that come frozen that you bake in the oven.  Customer service was rude and very unhelpful.  There's also a sign there that says they make all burgers medium well and mine had lots of pink in it (which I hate of course)."}
{"text":"I love Fatburger, but this location is disgusting and the customer service is horrible!  I stopped by after a movie to grab a burger, fry and chocolate shake.  I walked right up and ordered, however 30 minutes later, I'm still waiting.  When I walked up to ask what was taking so long the blonde girl said, \"Oh yeah, your shake...I'll get started on that.\"  Then someone walks up to order and she starts waiting on them before preparing my shake...LOL.  The customer is sweet and asks the employee to please make my shake before taking her order.  Meanwhile, my burger and fries are sitting under a heat lamp as they'd been done for 15 minutes!  I was being as patient as possible/trying to be understanding...I was just hungry and wanted to eat.  As the blonde girl hands me everything, the lady cook with frizzy hair starts openly sneezing everywhere!  She doesn't cover her face or anything and then has the nerve to look at me crazy when my face shows a look of disgust.  Whoever runs this Fatburger should be ashamed and I'm surprised the Fiesta Casino allows this type of business to run this way.  STAY AWAY from this Fatburger!"}
{"text":"A good burger spot that's open 24hrs is definateLy convenient for any burger Lover!
5am after a night in the cLub, FatBurger is the pLace to be!"}
{"text":"So I hold 5 to a high standard, and although I am giving this one a 3 that dose not mean its bad. With that being said this place was good, the service was fast and friendly. Food was fresh and hot, even after the 10 minute ride home."}
{"text":"I love a Fatburger!  Whenever we go to Vegas and stay in a place where there is one, you can find me sitting down and stuffing my face at least once during that trip.

The husband and I went last week to this one on the strip, I always get the medium burger with cheese, fat fries and a soda.  It does take a few minutes to get your food since it is cooked to order.  The staff here are always friendly and the food is always good.  It is super unhealthy, but damn, it's a good burger.  They also have really tasty onion rings which the husband always gets with his burger.

The restaurant is not the cleanest, as it is right on the strip and I think does a fair amount of business, but if you can get over that it's fine.  I used to be a huge In N Out fan, but they have gone down hill in the last few years and are more like a cheap cardboard burger with fries that are lacking.  Fatburger blows In n Out away!  

Between the burger and fries it's usually too much food for me, but I don't care, it's worth it.  You will pay more than $4-$5 for your meal, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I walk in and there are a whopping 2 people in the place..... the cashier yells \"gonna be a minute\" with his back to me.  15 mins later without an apology finally asks me if \"I was ready to order\".  Place is run like shit....food was good though, unfortunately it isn't enough to bring me back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and I probably should have read the reviews before going here. They clearly over charge from what's on the menu and management gets an attitude when you question it and tells you to call corporate. 

I ordered a kids meal which clearly said \"choice of burger, chicken fingers, or hot dog $7.59\". I ordered the burger with cheese and the cashier said without tax it would be $9 something so I opted out on the cheese. I pull up to the window (I was in drive thru) and the receipt still said $9.57 for a kids meal! I asked her again to explain why it was that much so she went and got a manager. After talking in circles saying that the burger was higher priced then the fingers,  she finally said it was because \"they charge extra tax\". On the receipt I had already been charged for tax so I asked why are we charged twice for tax??? She tells me to call corporate! 

Then to top it off the food was horrible. The burger was smashed and just thrown together. I used to love Fatburger and this location will make me second guess going to any other location again!"}
{"text":"Definitely wouldn't recommend this place. Right after I ordered, a guy wanted his money back and had a huge hair hanging from his burger. NASTY!!! I asked for my money back too, it disgusted me so much. Not only that, the service was sooooooooo slow."}
{"text":"Woohoo!  AGAIG indeed!  My favourite burger joint.  So much goodness!  The menu is incredible and the burgers are so dope it'll blow your mind.  The staff at this location are excellent too; extra friendly and very efficient and courteous, making for a wonderful experience overall.  The prices are reasonable given the portions as well.  Loads of free toppings, I always add an onion ring!"}
{"text":"Good food, great interior set up, and fun for everyone! I've tried a lot of the menu and any item is great. The burger itself is cooked well. While it may be tempting to order a larger burger when hungry I'd recommend trying a medium first as these burgers are pretty large."}
{"text":"There is good reason that this joint only has 2.5 out 5 stars for 53 reviews not counting mine: They suck!

I ordered a chocolate shake. At the wonder I was told the total was $4.75. Really? A full dollar more than the already overpriced menu? The guy says, \"oh yah, we're waiting for corporate to send us an updated menu\" uh... well isn't that called false advertising?

I wasn't in the mood to argue, the thought crossed my mind to just drive off but I went ahead and overpaid. Should have just driven away, worst, liquid, overpriced shake ever. 

Lesson learned, if you are going to have diet cheat treat, go to in n out and pay half for a MUCH better shake. 

This will be the final time I ever give Fatburger my business. They have failed to impress me every time I have tried them with their service (or lack therof), prices or food. I'm sure they'll go out of business soon."}
{"text":"Way overpriced from what it use to be. Food was just okay and fries where cold. Had to have the fries made fresh."}
{"text":"Overpriced dry burgers and frozen fries just doesn't cut it.  There's many better options in the GTA. ."}
{"text":"Place is nice, but the prices aren't really worth it in comparison even to other burger places. There's also a couple traps to be careful of, like how the thousand island fatburger is 7.19, but you can get a medium for 5.19 and get a free addon of thousand island. The service is nice, but the prices themselves are almost deterrents on their own. The food does take longer to get, but it seems to be for quality, so I'm fine with it. In summary, pricier but higher quality, careful of the traps.

Went through the drive thru a later day, and their drive thru sign's prices are unreadable, which is a pretty big problem."}
{"text":"This place isn't even open 24/7 went in and stood in line and these cleaners were cleaning the kitchen"}
{"text":"Not that great. I felt this place was a MAJOR let down. It was 23 dollars for two dry burgers and fries. They got my order wrong too. I'm only giving two stars because the fat fries were okay enough, even they didn't have much flavor. Wishing we went to Subway or McDonalds  instead. But at least we tried it ourselves."}
{"text":"I had a fried egg sandwich and a banana milkshake at 2 AM.  It was delicious. It's open 24/7 and in a great location."}
{"text":"Apparently they have new owners and want to charge for everything individually.  Bring the cost of a reg fat burger meal to over $13.  Yea sorry fat burger your dreaming of you think you can charge that for your burgers with 5 guys right across the street.  Fat burger you FIRED!  I doubt this location and its owners will be here very long. Bye Felicia !  5GUYS HERE I COME"}
{"text":"A great place to grab a quick bite of food, especially late at night. I think they're 24 hours... The atmosphere is boisterous with the workers singing along with their fancy jukebox, bumpin at club volumes. I wouldn't recommend eating inside unless you like that kind of thing. Anyway, even though this place looks kind of fishy, their burgers actually tasted fresh. They make it right when you order it; so, it's nice and hot. It kind of reminded me of In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went to Fatburger for the first time on my friends birthday and we had such a great time! At first the parking was really confusing only because we've never been to this area before, but once we figured it out; smooth sailing.

The restaurant is clean and the person taking our orders was very pleasant and even throughout the meal she checked to see if we needed anything. We both ordered the double king burger with one large fry. To my friend's surprise, the XXL king burger is not on the menu.. We figured that perhaps you have to request it? Or maybe they just don't have it in Canada, don't matter though, the double was amazing!

I couldn't finish my burger, it was way too big but the beef was delicious well cooked and we only waited about 10 minutes for our food (mind you this is a Sunday afternoon when no one was around, can't guartunee you ain't gonna be waiting long lol). The French Fries were just as good, super crispy which I like. My friend ended up wolfing down his burger and half of mine along with some fries; which of course totally put him over the edge.. (it's a lot of meat)

The best part about this burger is that it's juicy. This ain't the 'got cooked a couple hours ago and it's sitting in a warm oven' type, it was cooked fresh just for me. The bun does get soggy fast but hey it's a huge ass burger with tons of grease, what're gonna do? Complain?! Get the hell outta here! Lol 

After we finished our meals we went and ordered two chocolate milk shakes

Let me tell you about these milkshakes okay..

Let me tell you. It was the most delicious shake I've ever had. No exaggeration! Considering I live in Scarborough and literally the only place to get a decent shake is Dairy Queen OR McDonald's yes, this is considerably the best damn shake that has entered my body (that sounded kinda weird but you get the point), it's also made with fresh ice cream!! 

Can't deny I returned approximately a week later just to get another shake lol! Well worth the trip if you don't reside in Thornhill (to my Scarbies) you won't regret it"}
{"text":"My boyfriend loved this spot.  Nice service,  no wait time. Great value of food for the money. I love the fat fries."}
{"text":"I like these burgers.  It does cost more than In & Out, but you don't have to deal with the mob there.  Don't ever buy the milk shake without the combo.  I decided I wanted a milk shake to take home,,,,,,$4.16 for a one size of small.  It is hand made, but still,,,,,,"}
{"text":"Good burger served with lukewarm fries. Service is good but a bit slow when comparing to in n out or even 5 guys. Beef just above average, barely. Maybe it was an off day, willing to try again some time soon."}
{"text":"$27 for a Burger, drink, and 2 fries, (one was chilli cheese) mmmm it just tasted \"alright\" just like every other fast food burger. ill pass next time and hit the dollar menu at Burger King lol i get the same satisfaction ;p"}
{"text":"Great burger! I asked for ketchup and mayo for the base. The people working there did a great job. The grill is nice and clean and it hit the spot. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food was good, bartender fantastic, waitresses horrible. It was a great day so we decided to eat outdoors. We were told to sit at any table and a waitress would be with us shortly. Ten minutes later, after making eye contact and waving at 2 waitresses, we still had no menus. We decided to sit at the bar. Best decision every. The bartender, receipt said Lyman, took our order right away and got our drinks to us in no time. When the kitchen forgot one of our burgers he went to the kitchen and brought out the burger. The drinks were very potent. He really saved our lunch."}
{"text":"The only thing that holds this from being the best burger joint ever is the horrible onion rings , bland , tough , nasty 
Burgers are the best I've ever had .. double fat cheese is supreme , 
Staff is awesome, helpful , polite and deserve the tip someone else was bitching  about .
Restaurant is clean and comfy .... fix the onion rings and it's perfect !!!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I know it's a chain. So what? The burgers are awesome. 

I don't eat beef, so the turkey burger is my meat on a bun choice. Most places don't know what to do with turkey- it's like a foreign substance they   try to rid themselves of as quickly as possible. Fatburger, though, knows how to do a dead turkey justice. The meat is seasoned and cooked perfectly, resulting in a very tasty sandwich. 

The fries are great too- especially the fat ones. Yum."}
{"text":"Well here we go, my first 1 star review in Yelp!

The biggest reason is because it took them 30 freaking minutes to cook a freaking Baby Fat burger. Yep, a fast food restaurant actually beating a fine dining restaurant when it comes to serving! And no, it was not as if they were crowded. There were, believe it or not, just 4, FOUR people on the line. The poor guy in front of me had to wait 15 minutes just to be served up his soda. Oh man, it was so sad I almost laugh. And those clueless idiots (Pardon me) keep asking our orders for probably 5-6 times throughout the 30-minute torture.

The burger itself isn't that great, and is overpriced like hell. It was overcooked, dry and not juicy at all. And I finished a $3.50 burger with just 3-4 bites. Wew.

Just go to In-N-Out. I've not been to their outlet in Vegas but it would take something extraordinary to be worse than these guys."}
{"text":"Although quite yummy, burger had some unchewable fatty parts. Onion rings left a pool of grease at the bottom of tray. Many great selections of toppings, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"California burger and sweet potato fries were really good. Guacamole and bacon on the burger was delicious"}
{"text":"It's hit or miss here apparently.  Today, 8/25/12, the buns we're bordering on stale. That pretty much dampens the burger experience.  I know that it doesn't have to be this way because the Chase Field Fatburgers are always tasty.  I've had a good experience here before, but not today."}
{"text":"Hubby is originally from Southern California and absolutely loves Fatburger and since there aren't any close to where we live in the Bay he had to visit Fatburger on the strip while we were in Vegas. 

When we entered we noticed how small the space is and how you just know it is not clean. 

Mt husband ordered a fat king burger with egg and since I was not hungry I decided not to place an order. 

There was not very many people in the restaurant but it did take a little while for the food because the food is made to order. 

While we were waiting we met a very nice lady from Utah who was with her family. 

It is the typical fast food burger joint that has a lot a kids working. 

3 stars because my husband's burger was pretty good and typical of Fatburger. 

I bet we will be back when we visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"This place serves one of the best burgers I ever had!! I had the medium burger with everything and added cheese, guacamole, bacon and an egg! It was so good!! I had it with \"skinny chili cheese fries which were good. The service was fast! Place was packed and me and my boyfriend got our food asap! I will make this a must stop when I come to Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is very overrated. The hamburgers and sides are way overpriced. Sure,  the fried egg option is awesome but the burgers do not taste that great. I went to lunch here with a friend and between the two of us it was $28+ dollars. Way too much money for a fast food  hamburger stand. For that price, I could eat at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar. The service here sucks too, I was gambling around 4AM and went up to the counter. The guy cooking did not even acknowledge me.  So I just left. There are way better hamburger places than this dump!

Last great hamburger stand my A$$!!!!!!!!!!! --Very disappointed"}
{"text":"What in the actual fresh hell is this? $17 for two burgers with no sides or drinks?? $1 for a slice of cheese? Holy ba-nae-naes! Avoid this location at all costs people. **I would like edit add, that we got the single patty burger, and not the double patty burger. For an even larger awe inspiring view of why this price is outrageous."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly. You can request a fax sheet and just pick up your order for lunch. Loved that!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast, especially for being fairly busy and only having one person start the cooking and take the orders. I guess the other person was on break? Fat Burger is just as good in AZ and Cali as it is in Nevada. I order the veggie burger meal, my daughter a medium burger meal and my boyfriend the large burger meal. It came out to $31, and it was worth every bite. To save money next time we'll share soda's and save about $2 per drink since it's bottomless. :). Also if you wanted to save on time, call in the order. Remember Hidden Valley Ranch packet isn't free BUT sometime if you wait till the end and smile while asking nicely, you just might get it for free. :)"}
{"text":"Food is made fresh in front you, cashier Elizabeth friendly and trying her best to keep staff together. Not sure if they decides to train two new employees today (fries and shakes) but these two have no experience working in a fast paced environment. Wandering around or attempting to accomplish their tasks as slow as possible. Had three parties leave before their orders were completed or taken. Current observation is that both of the new employees are somehow both occupying the fryer."}
{"text":"Very meh. Didn't really care for the atmosphere. Very forgettable and bland. You'd be better off trying somewhere else for dinner and saving time, money, and your stomach. 

Not. Worth. It."}
{"text":"I went there on March 7th in the late afternoon.  My friend ordered before me and got a burger meal.  AND THE POWER WENT OUT RIGHT AS I WAS ORDERING!!  My friend ordered about 5 minutes before me so I got to eat some of her steak fries....the were awesome!!  Other than that not much else to say.  Gotta try them again some time.  The Nutter Butter Shake looked full of calories but delicious.  Better luck next time!"}
{"text":"The high star rating is mostly because this is one of the few places in the Green Valley Resort that's open after 11pm.  The chili cheese fries hit the spot- great crispy thin fries, gooey cheese, and meaty, but not too chunky chili.  The different burger size options is genius.  The middle option (large burge) is really big.  I can't imagine how someone could polish off an XXL burger.  Well, actually I'm sure that Adam from Man vs. Food could eat one no problem."}
{"text":"Won't be returning. At least to this location or until they can find a competent person to work the counter and take orders. It's really not that difficult of a job but for some reason the woman at cash register couldn't seem to be able to process what I was trying to order. First strike, out of fat fries. Then, she wrang my order in wrong so I had to reorder missing items. Next, a man who ordered was given his food but informed the cook he hadn't paid yet so he had to wait for the woman to come from the back so he could pay and take his food. The cook told her he needed to pay cause his food was ready and she instead of taking care of him proceeded to make a milk shake. Then the plain cheeseburger I ordered for my son came out with chili on it which I only ordered on the side. So we had to wait for the burger to be remade. As we are eating right now I notice that all they've done to \" fix\" his burger was wipe the chili of and re-grill it. In total I was in there for 25 min.  Fatburger, please get rid of this incompetent worker and rehire someone who has at least half a brain. Very frustrating!!"}
{"text":"Worst Fatburger experience ever.  A Fatburger, fries and chocolate shake was$17 + change.  Parking was $5.  $22 is way too much for Fatburger.  Some advice, go to InNOut up the street."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times to eat in and for take out. Fatburger is ok. Not awesome, not crap, but ok.

I think to be honest price has a lot to do with it. I should mention that I spent over 10 years working for a \"gourmet burger\" chain in Ontario, in the stores and later in the corporate offices. So  I get food cost, wanting to offer a better experience that McDonald's and be more upscale. And I think that is where Fat Burger falls down. While they are better than a \"cheap burger place\" but they fail to \"wow\" me. So then you become very aware you just spent $30 for a couple of burgers, fries and shakes. Better than McDonald? Yes. But I think they are over charging. They aren't THAT much better.

That being said, the food is decent. I would recommend eating in because they haven't quite mastered the art of packing up food to go-it comes out of the bag an absolute disaster. The burgers are good, the fries however leave a bit to be desired. The Chocolate shakes are also good and very filling. The turkey burger is a tasty choice if you are looking to avoid beef.

It would be nice to see Fatburger either lower their prices slightly, or improve their \"wow\" factor somehow to justify their prices a little more. We'd probably go more than once a year if they did that."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've ever had. When we first got to Vegas we went immediately to get something to eat and my husband said you have to try these burgers, of course I was skeptical, but soon as I bit in my burger OMG I was moaning and he said I told you. Awesome burger!!"}
{"text":"Terrible food.  Terrible service.  Very dirty establishment.  I don't know what all the hype is about over this place.  I believe its because of all the celebrities that endorse it.  But this place had a flat, dried out meat patty, much like one you would get at a Dennys.  Their choice of beef cut produced a mild flavored, non-juicy patty.  They burned my wife's burger, and when she tried to exchange it, they gave her attitude by trying to tell her it was just the cheese.  But they did end up making her another one.  \"In n Out\" or \"5 Guys\" are both much better choices.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Went by their today 7/26/17 wed and place had been Red tagged & closed down by the Heath department ( Yuck gross) Never again will i go back!"}
{"text":"Fatburger was good. Onion rings were okay. Lemonade was refreshing."}
{"text":"What did you do to my FATBURGER! This was, for years, my go to place for a great burger, great service, and ambiance. What happened!?

The last three times I've been here have been horrible. Two times ago, we were the only people in the place and there wasn't a clean table to be found. We had to ask someone to clean a table. A guy comes out with a dirty rag (smelled like dirty dishwater) and smeared the table \"clean\" and left with an attitude. Haven't seen him again, but still. After that, we've ordered takeout.

Last two times the service was TERRIBLE. Last night OVER THIRTY FIVE minutes to get three burgers and we were the only ones there. Now, that would be fine (it's not fast food) except they made our shakes first and they were all ruined before we even got our food. It's TAKEOUT! Are we supposed to drink our shakes before we leave? I guess I have to take the whole family with me to pick up our food, not sit down at the filthy table, drink our shakes at the counter while we wait over a half hour for a burger where the bread was hard, the meat was over cooked and the guy behind the counter looked like he wanted to be ANYWHERE else. If you're the owner of this Fatburger, please GET YOUR ASS IN THERE and straighten these guys out. Better yet, get the old guys back. You know? When your place had good service. So extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I was told that you can't go to Las Vegas and not stop in Fatso Burger 

Well worth the stop, I grabbed a couple of burgers and fries at 3 am 

Fabulous !!"}
{"text":"Last night I had Anthony as my server and he was amazing. He had great customer service and was so nice. I would defiantly come back to this location."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews are they are not good, so why do I like this place? It's old fashioned, the service was great - just nice and polite. It takes a bit longer to get your food (it's a good thing). Open kitchen. The burger was super messy in a yummy way. The meat was not a perfect flat circle it actually seemed like real beef. I drank a full sugar cherry coke and it was worth every calorie. I got the skinny fries, not because I thought they had less calories but I like skinny stick fries that are crispy and they were. 
I got a medium fatburger with cheese & grilled onions, medium skinny fries, drink, the kid got: small fatburger with cheese, fat fries and milk shake. It came to a little over $20. 
The only thing that would improve is beer. The only negative is a bit too salty but that might be why it was so good too."}
{"text":"This is great burger ever...I love fat fries!!!
Good serve and good fix my burger. Yummmm"}
{"text":"I will never and I mean never go to Fat burger again. my roommate went to get us dinner he got home and they shorted us a burger. he called them to get it straightened out they said he was lying, therefore we are out of our money but that will be the last time. I suggest find a different place not worth the money anyways but if you do go be sure to check your bag before you leave n if they try to short your order smack the shit out of them."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours great! But because of its location it seemed like everyone in Vegas was hungry at the same time so the wait for food was long then once I ordered it was about a half hr until my number was called. So service was bad.

Cleanliness was not taught to any of the employees there and the bathroom was hideous and smelled horrible.

Only positive was how delicious the food was despite the high prices."}
{"text":"I come here every time I go to Vegas. I recommend this place highly. I always get the 1/2 pound chews and bacon burger with myshrooms on the side. ( they tend to make the burger bun wet) so input on after wards. But a solid choice in the strip. 

I actually saw pharrel roll in here with a bunch of guys and girls at 5 am Friday night. It was crazy!!"}
{"text":"Wow - great experience! The burger was incredible and the service was even better. At the end of the meal, I was wrapping up what was left of my son's burger, and the cashier dropped by with a paper bag and bagged it for me. Outstanding job, Fatburger! You've earned a loyal customer."}
{"text":"If you get here and there are more than two people in line in front of you, don't expect to order for at least 10 minutes.  It took the cashier forever to enter the order into a computer and you have to speak slow and repeat it several times.  If you order a shake, she will make it before taking the next order in line.  

After we finally ordered, it took 20 minutes to get our burgers!  We were told the fries were taking longer to cook and would be a few minutes.  The burgers were good, but they had started to cool off by this point.  I had ordered the new Thousand Island Burger, they had apparently forgot that small detail.  It took so long to get this one that I didn't even bother having them redo it.

The fries arrived 8 minutes later and were slightly undercooked.  They were done, but not crispy yet.  you could tell right away because they were not that golden brown color.  We had ordered 3 orders of fat fries,  but she brought two fat and one skinny fries.  She told us that she gave us what was available and didn't want us to wait any longer.  She dropped the platter on the table and walked away.  I guess we did better than other people who ordered onion rings, they got the same skinny fries and were told that there was something wrong with the onion rings and that's all they had.  I guess the other people figured the same thing, the wait was so long why even bother fighting it.  The staff didn't even bother offering a refund for the extra dollar it costs for the onion rings!

The meal was ok, but not worth the 30 minutes it took to get part of the order.  The last straw was when my wife pointed out the water stained roof tiles above us.  They were painted black, but now some of the tiles had obvious water damage and one even looked like it had white mold growing on it.

I don't ever expect to be coming back, there are just too many choices out there, especially at their prices!"}
{"text":"We have juicy delicious Fatburgers where I live in Escondido, CA so I thought I would impress my friend with the best burger of her life while we were in Vegas. But that didn't happen with four dry overcooked burgers and lame skinny fries. They put mayo on mine which I hate and never ask for. Then I jacked my car on the excessively long concrete guide on the way out of the drive thru. Be careful not to cut that corner! Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My first time eating Fat Burger and i must say i am impressed. Burger and fries were awesome. Definitely enough to share!"}
{"text":"I love Fatburger...that being said, this location is awful. Somehow they have been able to hire the most inept and incompetent people on the planet. 3 people in line when i walked in...took close to 15 minutes to order. When I did order I had to repeat my order 4 times so that the girl could slowly enter it into the computer. It seemed like the only person who knew what was going on was the poor manager who was running around working the grill, fries, and register when the girl had a question every 35 seconds. The other 2 employees may have well just gone home. It pains me to see a place that has the potential to make such amazing burgers be butchered like this. All i can think of is..and they want $15/hr?? Ha!!"}
{"text":"Burger for it self is not that good... Lack spice... And the price, not fair. To expensive, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Hubby and I visited LV recently and came to Fatburger to nurse our hangovers before we drove out.. Service SUCKED... we waited for THIRTY minutes and then they brought us pancakes when we ordered burgers... We knew something was up becasue ALL the cooks in the kitchen were fighting over the tickets the whole time we were there.. These people were SERIOUSLY disorganized and I can't be too sure but there was a large sweaty girl cook that appeared to be unable to read. Everyone kept pointing at the tickets and telling her what they said. 

It took a total of 40 minutes to make 2 burgers and 1 order of fries. I got a medium which was about the size of a wendys burger with a fluffy bun and it cost $5 for JUST THE BURGER! Nothing special about it.. Except for the relish... sooo... congrats you put a hotdog condiment on a burger and thought it was special."}
{"text":"First time ever going to a fat burger and the last time. 
For four meals with no add on's one of the meals being a kids meal all medium drinks and the smallest frys our total came to $47. I pulled up to the window and waited about 8 minutes for the employee to even come to the window and I asked him to repeat the order and total. I proceeded to tell him that he's best off canceling my order because I will not pay $47 for 3 adults and a kids meal. That averaged out to about $11.75 a meal He proceeds to ask if I am serious.  Of course I am. I could go sit down at a restaurant and pay that....this place is way over priced and the service is really slow. The place was about empty thus why I didn't not understand the delay. Don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would.  Fatburger has great food. That being said, this location is horrible.  They can't get an order correct and the fries are always burnt to a crisp.  Customer service is nonexistent and they have an \"oops\" attitude when they forget food in your order or give you someone else's order.  Don't waste your money or time. Go to a different location."}
{"text":"The main thing I'm upset about is two people after me who ordered a burger and drinks got theirs before my one burger.   Bad business. ....  they suck with the service."}
{"text":"Eh.  This is the second Fatburger I have been to, as I usually like to give mediocre a second try in case it was a fluke.  Nope, sorry Fatburger- you are just bland.  The burger was lacking excitement.  Bland was the theme of the day here.  The prices were way out of line for the end product.  Oh well."}
{"text":"The service isn't the fastest but the food is great and they have never screwed up any of my orders like other fast food places."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that.. if i could give this place 3.4 stars i would (not 3.5 because I didn't feel strongly about rounding up another star, unfortunately.)

Its true the burger here are delicious - the condiments were generously piled onto the burger, and it was so perfectly wrapped (yes, the ocd side of me lights up at things like this). The fries are some of the most delicious fries ever.  I just had some, and I kind of want some more already.  They're so perfectly cooked - crunchy on the outside without satisfying any of the soft interior (I'm referring to the skinny fries).

However, minus 1 star because I have to say that it unfortunately reminds me greatly of another burger joint that I love much more (rhymes with mud suckers).  I know it's not fatburgers fault, but it is unfortunate that the burger reminds me too much of another (better) one I've already tried.  Please save the hate mail, loyal fatburger fans.. this is my personal and honest opinion.

Minus another star because I asked for mayo on the side and I found my burger fully dressed with mayo in my burger.  I could have let it slide, but my friend also asked for a burger without some of the condiments, and unfortunately his burger also came as if he has asked for a burger with everything.

I will recommend this place though - if you're in the area.  It isn't good enough for me to drive all the way to the strip and park in a club parking lot and have to walk around a bunch of drunk jackasses eager to prove how macho they are to some girl who is not even interested in them and deal with parking specifically for it though."}
{"text":"Went by tonight because I was craving a burger....arrived at 9:14pm...mind you, they are still supposed to be open at this very moment according to the time as the door clearly stated 10:00pm ( I even checked online to see what time they closed to be sure) and the red open sign was still on which is why I went inside. However, when I walked in, there was a gentleman at the grill wiping it, lights were dimmed and chairs put up. I asked if they are already closed and he replied almost,I then asked if I could order something since it was only 15 after 9 and they are not due to close till 10pm.. instead of responding he turns and goes to the back....So I waited (mainly just to see if he was going to come back or wait, hoping I would leave) he then comes back out about 3 minutes later and I ask the same question...then I ask to speak to a manager he points to the a wall and says you can call.  I said what is the manager's and is there a number or card....he replies no...I again ask for the manager's name and he replied Eduardo.  I said, I saw another employee in the back when I walked in can I speak to him. The 2nd employee comes out and tells me he was cleaning the bathrooms and he was the acting manager.  He nonchalantly apologized for the other reps behavior and asked if he could help me...Sir, you have turned off the lights, picked up all the chairs, turned off all the grills and have bathroom hands...what exactly is it that you think you can do for me at this point?  I am in complete shock at the lack of anything that this place of business had to offer me, which was nothing.  I then ask him for the manager's name and info, he says I am the manager, I then said, the other gentleman just said it was Eduardo, he then said, \"Eduardo is the GM I am acting manager\".  I said, \"can I please have the GM's info please\", he again stated, in his nonchalant manner, \"he will be in tomorrow\".  I know it's the holiday season and everyone is trying to get home to their families but if your sign says open and your doors are not locked and I walk in, don't ignore me, just hoping I will go away, that is just horrible!! NEVER AGAIN Fatburger!!!!!"}
{"text":"I should've just stuck with In N Out. They've never done me wrong. I decided to give Fatburger a try since I never had one. I didn't care for them. The patty was kind of crumbly and tasted a bit like the homemade ones I make. The bread was not good and I tossed one of them out. Also, they were too pricey, and I didn't like the fact that you had to pay extra for things such as cheese. This really jacks up the price. In & Out is just one low price for a delicious burger. Also, the staff were just standing around and yakking with each another. This was annoying when they were around me when I was eating. I had to also disturb their gossip time to wipe my table, which they should've taken care of instead of yakking."}
{"text":"we have eaten at this location  a couple of times now and both times amazing food, friendly staff & location is nice and they even have a bar for those who like beer with your burgers. this is our go to spot for burgers glad to have one in our niebourhood."}
{"text":"I got a turkey burger combo with a Maui shake and fat fries paid 20, waited in drive thru for 25 mins got my order. Once at home the burger was cold the onion rings were soggy and the fries looked like there were just dumped in the bag, mind you I only live 10 mins away. When I called the store some girl answered I asked for a manager she said no one was there and stated\"umm I'm trying to work \" and she HUNG UP ON ME!! I called back and she answered again once I said I wanted to talk to someone else She hung up on me again, I called once more got Brandon who was very nice and polite but when I asked for the rude girl name he said \"I think it's Christina\" (I mean don't you work there? You don't know who you working with) anyways ... never going to this location again."}
{"text":"Today i ordered Fatburger from UberEATS. I that is the best decision i have made since a couple of months ago when i decided to start going to the gym. Looking at the Uber driving towards my house was a sight for sore eyes. He was so nice and i gave him a big tip. 

Now flash forward to when he handed me the warm and greasy paper bag, i was so excited to dig in to this delicacy, the aromas had me hypnotized. I opened the bag and the first thing i saw was two baggies filled with 'moist' towelettes, mints, toothpicks, and ketchup. (How thoughtful!) after that i finally came in contact with the burger(s) that i ordered; a Veggie burger meal and  Cheeseburger for my smol brother. I greedily opened the wrapper like a toddler at Christmas and dug in. It wasn't what i expected. It was better! The burger was warm and tasted fresh! I loved it! The while experience was great. I even asked for them to put a scoop of vanilla ice cream into my root beer (in the comment section) and they did it. 

This is officially my favorite fast food place, and im vegetarian! 12/10"}
{"text":"So very, very, very dirty.  People were nice but disgusting EVERYWHERE! I honestly don't know how they're able to stay open."}
{"text":"I have been to this Fatburger about 3-4 times now, and every time, my burger has been excellent.  I agree that the place does look like a dump - but I never go inside, I do the drive thru.  maybe they don't have air conditioning, but I don't care as long as they hand me out my burger!  I think it's the best tasting of all the fastfood burgers.  It is expensive, I agree, but I think it's worth it.  And so far, the drive-thru staff have always been very nice to me.  Don't go inside - just get your burger and head home!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to a Fatburger.  While it's freezing in here, and the place was deserted at 7:00 on a Saturday night, the guys here were quick and friendly.   The burgers were very good.   Wasn't exceptional, but way better than typical fast food.  I'd get the skinny fries next time.   Solid burger choice."}
{"text":"WAY OVERPRICED!! $15 for a burger, fries and drink. I could go to a full sit down restaurant and get a 3 course meal for this price. They need to seriously bring the prices down... way down!!"}
{"text":"Ok so me and my wife go to fatburger inside the Santa fe casino and i have to say i was very very disappointed. I have eaten at fat burger several times so I can say definitely a bad experience at this location. So we ordered our hamburgers my a bat fat with cheese and a XXL no cheese as we're waiting for our food the manager approached our table and tells me they messed up and put cheese on my burger and if that was ok, I said NO nicely and they brought out our food minus my burger and I was ok with that since they were correcting there mistake. So now when they bring out my burger it has double patties so i open it up to salt it and the patties were completely broken apart and I figure it's ok since in not one to send food back so if that wasn't bad enough the patties were so overdone and dried out I didn't even eat the whole thing. I was very disappointed in my order especially when your spending over 10 bucks for a burger...was not happy and will not eat at that location again...I dont know if it was done out of spite since i said no to the cheese burger or if there cook is just bad at his job but i am not willing to find out again,"}
{"text":"I went here my first night in Vegas with my mom who had talked this place up so much before we came. I was pretty disappointed when my burger arrived and the patty was burnt and tasted like someone poured the salt and pepper shakers over it for a good two minutes. The fries were the redeeming factor for this meal since they were sooo good! The service was great too which is my reason for the second star. Maybe I ate here on a fluke night, but next time I would prefer McDonalds to this place."}
{"text":"I had a veggie Burger here. It tasted good, but was a little bit messy when I unwrapped it. The price is the only reason it doesn't get more stars."}
{"text":"First, I feel like I should defend Fatburger from those who complain about the price or the length of wait for the food.  Yes, a fatburger costs more than a Quarter Pounder or a Whopper, and yes it takes longer to get.  That's because (A) it's a thicker (fatter) burger with fresher ingredients, and (B) it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp waiting for you to come in and order it.  A fatburger is cooked to order, so they are fresh.  Quality is a positive thing, even if you have to pay for it, or wait for it.

In my high school days, when I had a little extra to spend, I used to go to Fatburger with a group of friends and get some chili-cheese fries covered with diced onions and a chocolate milk shake made with real ice cream.  We would hang out in the lobby, listening to that great old time rock 'n' roll and classic soul that they always play.  Those were good times.

Now that I try to eat healthier, it's been a couple of years since I've had their chili cheese fries or milk shake, but I still go to Fatburger once in awhile just for their veggie burger.  Kudos to Fatburger for offering a healthy alternative to standard fast food fare.  (If only In-N-Out Burger would introduce a burger with a veggie patty).  Fatburger uses a substantial Boca patty in their veggie burgers, and it makes for a tasty, satisfying meal.  It's probably the only thing I'll ever order from Fatburger anymore, so it's a really smart way to keep people like me coming back."}
{"text":"What's wonderful about a 24hr Fat Burger? Well if were like me and craved a juicy burger at 5am, this is a dream come true. I get here and I am met with fellow breakfast burger aficionados. I got myself a XXL with cheese, bacon, egg, and avocado. Sitting outside on the Vegas strip at 5am enjoying a well-made burger is pretty amazing.... It's American!"}
{"text":"I had SUCH high hopes for Fatburger.  It was 4:30 in the morning and a nice big burger was just what the doctor ordered.  

First, this place was a MESS.  There was so much garbage on the floor, there was no way we would eat there.  I ordered the Fatburger and fries and we took it back to our room.  I definitely enjoyed the fries because I LOVE steak fries.  My burger was a disappointment.  It was super charred on the edges and the cheese was not melted at all.  The bun tasted a little stale too.  I may give Fatburger another chance if I'm ever around one...but that's only because my friend told me they have awesome chili cheese fries..."}
{"text":"the burgers here are really good. Everything is made to order and comes to the table hot and fresh. They did some renovations to this location and that may explain their prices. The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the price. If you buy two combo meals the price will run you close to $30."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, burger was huge and fantastic. best burger I've had in a while.  Fat fries were piping hot. The only gripe was the Vegas prices but everything in Vegas is ridiculous. Don't hesitate get your burger here. Very casual diner feel."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood, so I decided to drop by again to try their bacon cheddar burger. Unlike McDonalds, they certainly don't cheap out on the actual bacons. 

Still had difficulty finishing the meal due to the sheer size of it, but can't really complain about the freshness of both the burgers and the salad.

Customer service was excellent as usual and the place was spotless!"}
{"text":"This was the first time we ate at fat burger,,, the customer service was excellent and the food ! Wow so fresh and amazing I had the regular burger my hunny had the XXL he couldn't even finish it... truly a great place to eat and well worth the price! Our server LILI was awesome\""}
{"text":"Oh this place is awesome I love the theme it's vintage and lovely , the burgers are huge and tasty , I love the fries as well super friendly staff. I would love to go again to try more food. Prices were reasonable as well it's a cool place for date night."}
{"text":"Wow i finally tried the famouse fat burger. And dam was it good. So so dam good. Makes a fat boy smile kinda good. Had the large with cheese and an egg. I was blown away with the great combo. I love this place."}
{"text":"Aparently they don't  how to put half a vanilla shake and half a strawberry shake together. What really upset me was that the girl who was helping us decided to talk shot about us (the customer) right in front of us. Extremely unprofessional. She also decided to tell me that the woman toasting buns in the back was her manager. What a joke."}
{"text":"Las hamburguesas estan comibles y saben a carne. Son completas pero Las Cobran bien. El personal correcto aunque las prisas hacen casi que si no entiendes muy bien ingles te den el tamaño grande.
Esta situado dentro del casinon Sunset Station y es desagradable llevarte todo el olor a aceite y fritanga en la ropa. Podrian invertir un poco mas en estraccion de aire."}
{"text":"We stayed at the MGM while in Vegas so this was a great find for the late night craving of a greasy burger.  Wide and I split a burger and fries and it was quite delicious...thin crispy diner style.  Beer is a bit pricey, but it's right on the strip so that's to be expected"}
{"text":"First time at this location. Midnight snack and they were packed. We placed our order and right about when we were starting to wonder why it was taking so long they approached us and informed us they lost our ticket. The manager, Cisco, took care of the issue with excellent customer service.. Although delayed, the food was great."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Fatburger for lunch, since this is considered a popular location on the Vegas Strip. I had the Turkey Burger with guacamole and my husband and I split an order of fries (my husband had a regular bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg). Thirty-plus dollars later, I have to say I was a little disappointed. With all the hype, I expected something greater. The food wasn't spectacular; the food wasn't bad. It was just woefully average. It's definitely not somewhere I would visit more than once."}
{"text":"Need some grease and a cheaper option on the strip?  You need to try a Fatburger!  They have really fresh ingredients for a fast food joint.  They have some decent milkshakes as well.  There are a plethora of options that you can add to your burger as well.  Check out the menu and mix and match something that would fit you!

Don't waste your time in McD's or any of the other fast food places.  The only fast food restaurant I'd recommend in Vegas is In N Out but that's off the strip."}
{"text":"This place is full of shit...worst service ever!!!!!!! We order 6 burger and 3fries, they took over 1hour when is not busy at all.....when they bring ours foods, they were disrespectful. Bring your business some where else, worst Fat burger ever!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place! They don't need Groupon coupons to drive business, they need to fire their staff and hire people who actually want to work and be in the service industry.  Waited over 30 minutes while the server walked past us several times, used her cell phone twice and then continued to chat with the bartender and other staff. Other tables were getting same service and up and left.  3 other staff walked past our table several times and couldn't even bother to acknowledge. There's a lot of other great places if you are craving a burger."}
{"text":"Burger with tasty smoky grilled flavor and choice of toppings. May order different weight patties. Really enjoyed the crispy outside, soft inside \"fat\" fries (similar to steak fries). The\"skinny\" fries tasted like McD's if you prefer. The lemonade was made from real lemons with pulp in the tart and sweet drink. Only negative was the price (reason for 4 rather than 5 stars), but this Fatburger is on the Las Vegas Strip, so bet less expensive at other sites."}
{"text":"I can see why people will love this place while drunk, but sober me is reviewing it and I think other burger places do it better.

I'm currently comparing this to In N Out.  I'm from Florida, so we don't have Fatburger or In N Out, which is why I had to get both on my trip here (I'll try Shake Shack tomorrow).  First disclaimer, I love In N Out, so this would have had to be pretty darn good to beat that.  Unfortunately, it did not live up and it even somewhat disappointed.

First the good, the burger meat is solid.  I got the turkey burger, sans bun, with cheese, and it was delicious.  The shake is also pretty good.  It had a huge heaping of whipped cream on the top that I enjoyed.

The bad, the price is insane.  I got a turkey burger, chili cheese fries, and a milkshake.  Total was $20.  At In N Out, that same meal is $10.  I don't know if it is more expensive, since I'm in vegas, but holy cow.  Also, I was not impressed with the fries.  They were definitely not worth the calories.  I got the skinny fries and ended up throwing them out.  With In N Out I'm scrapping the bottom of everything to get the last remnants of cheese.  This cheese was just meh.

So overall, I wouldn't suggest wasting your calories or your money on this place.  But, then again, when you're drunk this place is probably heaven."}
{"text":"Shittiest service I've ever received in my entire life. Two female Mexican workers took 35 minutes making A SALAD and kept talking amongst themselves complaining about other customers and rolled their eyes at me when I looked at them. All they did was complain and chatter to themselves. I'm here right now, still waiting on that salad...."}
{"text":"Love fat burgers they have the best turkey burgers. Best spot to watch the game. The waitress Lexi was very friendly, the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"4 Stars for the price to food quality.  The food was great for the price you pay.  The bar has decent priced drinks as well.

HOWEVER....

This place is in the ghetto vortex of the strip.  You know that place from M&Ms world until Planet Hollywood?  That is the ghetto vortex.  Tattoo parlors, porn slappers galore, bums cursing at you for not smiling (really?), those creepy statue people, some lady at a stall trying to sell a towel that wraps around a woman's waist (reallyx2?), some dude with a shirt that has LEDs on it (kinda like an updated bedazzle), and another dude trying to get me to go to the Grand Canyon.  They will ask me \"you wanna go to the Grand Canyon?\"  The best thing to do is to reply with a \"you wanna go to [insert horrible city here]?\"  I usually use Port Arthur, TX.  This area of the strip reminds me of the part of the Thriller video where the zombies come out of nowhere and scare the hell out of the girl...then MJ turns into a zombie for some reason....everybody dances and things get annoying.  The ghetto vortex is like that.  Kinda creepy and very annoying.

Watch out for the ghetto vortex and eat a burger at Fatburger.  It is a nice change from the fine-dining expensive restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here because I wanted to try their Skinnyburger, which is shown on the company website as being a bunless burger with two patties on the outside and the fillings in the middle. I asked the countergirl if they had it, because I didn't see it on the menu, and she said yes but only in a medium size. So I ordered it, with all the fixins. What I got was a cheeseburger patty plopped atop a mishmash of lettuce, relish, and a tomato slice.

If you're a low-carb diner, don't eat here unless you want to pay $8 for a sorry cheeseburger salad."}
{"text":"Great fresh burgers. I had cheese burger with fried egg side of chili onion rings. Price kind of high. Original LA is much better."}
{"text":"long lines, made sloppily, take forever, bad service, however the drunken crowds that fill this place along with the never changing satisfying taste make this place a four star"}
{"text":"Okay, this location is TERRRRIBLE. Waited in the drive-thru for almost 30 minutes, mind you, there was NOBODY here. No one in the drive thru, no one inside, we were the ONLY people here & it still took that long  everything on the menu was \"non existent\" & after i got my food, it wasn't even the correct order so i finally left & said F*#k it! never again will i come back to this location."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to fat burger it was a fat disappointment! Restaurant was dirty it took forever for the burger to come and when it did it had no taste very blan no seasoning at all only pepper. This place was over priced for the quality and service of the food in my opinion if you charge restaurant  prices you should serve restaurant quality. This place charges 10.00 for a burger and an extra 1.00 for cheese and 1.00 for every extra you get on the burger the meal did come with onion rings that were the only good part of this meal. They should call this place fat onion rings because the burger was dry and tasteless I will not return to this place I live close by and was really hoping this would be my new burger joint:("}
{"text":"The location of this location is awesome and I love that they are 24hr and they even have a bar! But the food wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.  I was definitely disappointed and what really got me upset was the fact that I paid $20 for a cheese burger with fries and a drink. I don't know about you but that's too expensive and the food wasn't even great."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Burger 'joint' in Vegas. I prefer it over In-and-Out, I havent tried GR's BRGR yet but plan on it next week! Fatburger is one of those places that just tastes great along with their fried. This year when we went, they added a FATBAR which has an outdoro bar, outdoor seating and table service instead of the inside, where you place your order after waiting in line and what not. the inside portion still exists but the outside is a very nice new add on. Love the burgers and love the 24 hours! try to eat there 2-3 times in my 5 day stays!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. Great affordable place to eat on the strip"}
{"text":"We used a groupon deal 16 bucks for 2 burgers and fries, the restaurant itself is trendy, clean and theres parking in the back. I liked that the burgers come with set toppings that you can also omit as you wish, they also had a lot of free premium toppings like onion rings and fried onions that some burger joints charge extra for which was nice. I enjoyed my burger, it takes longer to get your food compared to fast food burgers but they do promote its fresh never frozen made to order angus beef burgers. One other thing id have to compliment them on is their custoner service... the staff actually walk up to you to check on your meal and she even offered to get refills to another customer."}
{"text":"I have always been a Fatburger fan. If you have never had a burger from here you have got to try it. The fat fries are awesome and the onion rings are always freshly made. I have never had anything I didn't like"}
{"text":"In and Out kills this place, you gotta be kidding. Ok. Check this... 3 guys order normal hamburger meals.... 34 goddamn dollars. This place is expensive enough to be fine dining. It also takes forever to get your food. You wake up the next day feeling awful, not for all that whaskey you drank, but for the burger that waged a tiny war in your large intestine all night. Skip it.

wait. bonus star for the sweet jukebox. getting to put on some ol' willie and merle - pancho and lefty, at 4am in a public venue is almost more than a drunk man can take."}
{"text":"Poor service! They took long and aren't even as busy as In and Out. 
The ignorant cashier with tats on her hands took my order repeated back my order several times after I clarified NO ONIONS. She kept saying everything? I had to consistently clarify NO ONIONS. She finally said ok.

After waiting 15 mins for my order, I drive home to take a bite into a saturated burger full of uncooked white onions!
I specifically said NO onions! I hate raw onions on burgers! 
So call to tell her she messed up on my order. All I was asking for was for them to remake it but she insisted on arguing to justify she's right. She only heard what she wanted to hear and didn't want to admit wrong. Again all I was calling for was to have them simply fix and remake my burger. She was just wasting my time and breathe. 
Clearly nothing was going to get handled over the phone.
She lacks good work ethics and has no understanding of customer service skills. 

I'm so annoyed. 10 min drive, 15 min wait, had to drive back and wait for her to refund my card. That's about 40 wasted mins of my life I'll never get back! 

Why go here and pay more for their bad service and greasy I've priced burgers when Smashburger and In and Out are down the street on Tropicana and Forte Pache?"}
{"text":"15 Bucks for a fast food burger and fries? it was ok but that's way too expensive."}
{"text":"FINALLY, I sample the notorious Fatburger, which we don't have up in the Bay Area.  And my reaction was--OK.

Yes, the burger was Fat.  The fries were also Fat, but that's the way I picked them, and I did like them.  Simple, potatoey, and no weird coating on the outside like some competitors' fries.

I guess if you desperately need a fast food burger and you're in the gravitational pull of a Fatburger, you could do worse.  I prefer it to Fuddruckers and might even take it over In-n-Out, but Jeffrey's and Val's in the Bay Area are far better burgers to my taste.

This particular Fatburger seems to be brand new and part of a sprawling outdoor mall here on the edge of the desert north of Scottsdale.  It won't be the edge of the desert for long, of course, since Great Phoenix seems to grow like creepy fingers of killer space fungus in a Sci-Fi movie of some kind.  By this time next year it will be 20 miles in from the northern edge of Greater Phoenix, and the locals will see it as a quaint relic of bygone times in an aging layer of this megalopolis."}
{"text":"not a big fan of burgers and i thought the burgers tasted like mcDonalds burgers. but i was hungry. it's a place seems like everyone after clubs and bars go to."}
{"text":"The food is the same as any other fat burger, meaning they are good. Why 2 stars? The service is just really really bad. They have a self seat system which would work great if they had a way of knowing who just sat down. Usually once you order the waitress puts a number on your table, well here.. You sit to numbers already assigned to the table. It's just weird. You have to seat in a dirty table to get seats since it's outside on the strip but it might confuse the waiters since it looks like you just ate. We had to stop one of them and ask if someone can clear the table. The waitress took a very long time to get our order, bring the food and the check and I actually didn't mind the wait since we had good seats watching bystanders at the strip but I did see 2 different groups of ppl leave because they were never acknowledged. I didn't mind the waiting game but don't expect to sit and get your food fast, for those that are hungry it's definitely not a good place. In total, we waited about 10-15 to get someone to clear the table we got, another 15 min to get the waitress to take our drinks & order, another 5-7min for her to bring the drinks, 40-45 min to get our food."}
{"text":"I am not sure I was at the same place as the other reviewers. 
My experience was pretty darn good. 
The customer service was great. The place was clean. 
The burgers were fresh and tasty. The service was rather quick. They cook to order so I would think this may be why it takes a few extra minutes."}
{"text":"After watching Jabbowakeez we needed sustenance and opted for something quick on the strip. This place isn't much better than any other fast food joint. It was good but nothing special.
 The fries were really nothing special and the beef patty was a sorry excuse to call a burger. My chicken sandwich was good though"}
{"text":"It's a fat,  fast food burger.  You pick how many meat patties you want on it. It comes with shredded lettuce, diced onions,  pickles, and  mustard. The fries are nice and fat,  just don't let them get cold."}
{"text":"I ordered through post mates and they omitted onions and mustard from my soy burger, unfortunately the mustard and onion is what gives it all the flavor, so I was disappointed, especially bc when I called, they had the ingredients, they just didn't add it. They didn't season my fries either. I called and they offered me a redo it a refund.

I will say, I'm a big fan of fatburger (they started in LA) and I think they make the best burgers. 

Their soy patty is really thick, much thicker than a boca patty. & it was juicy, not dry.

Get the Maui banana shake and fries."}
{"text":"I love fat burger. I get a Medium with cheese, eggs, bacon with fat fries and a sprite. I get indigestion for 2 days after. Come hungry."}
{"text":"Absolutely love fatburger but I've had so many negative experiences at this location I refuse to patronize them again. No way."}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far and I thought it was a decent place.

I wasn't sure what to make of the sizes when I looked at the menu, but the burger I ended up ordering was humongous and probably the largest burger I can remember eating. I thought it was pretty good, although I'm not ready to call it a favorite just yet."}
{"text":"I had the turkey burger and it actually tasted really good. I added an egg and some mushrooms and just had lettuce , pickles and cheese. It was really nice. That being said not worth the 15 minute more wait. For a fast food burger joint it shouldn't really be acceptable. Especially not here in a place like Vegas."}
{"text":"These two women busting their butts for a dollar. They know how to cook. The one lady coughing all over the place. This probably happens all over the place but to sit at the counter and watch the lady cough made me uncomfortable. Great work ethic but for an open kitchen... that sucks for them. Tasty food. Sorry gals. Open kitchen concept is a disaster unless you own it."}
{"text":"As the rating says. I've experienced better. I will be reviewing the Veggie burger costing about $6. Good chunk of food. Big enough to fill out our stomach even if you skipped morning breakfast. But it was not as tasty. The soy patty was plain tasteless and the whole wheat bread doesn't fit a big burger. It could use more lettuce and less salt."}
{"text":"A lot of these reviews made me laugh because I'm not quite sure what people were expecting - it's FAST FOOD, (albeit pricy fast food)lol! I had a Groupon so my friends and I went all out so that we could get a variety of things.  I thought the staff here was really friendly, even bringing food to our table.  The shakes are amazing and I love all the topping options!  The veggie burger is tasty and my friends devoured their beef burgers.  Although the curly fries are the most popular, we decided the skinny fries are the best. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered a plain hamburger at 7:16 pm. At 7:30 pm they hadn't even put it on the grill (needless to say there was nothing on the grill for about 10 minutes). Not sure where the disconnect is between the cashier and the cook who is 8 feet away. Everyone is complaining and the customer in front was waiting even longer. Samantha did nothing about it until people started demanding a refund. Said she was sorry and couldn't give a reason why everyone's food was so delayed. 7:43pm we got our plain hamburger. Corporate please help before this location fails !!"}
{"text":"Great greasy burgers with or without the works...this place is ALWAYS packed but after a long flight or a long night, it never disappoints."}
{"text":"The food was horrible at this location I don't mind eating at fat burger but this location the food was horrible every thing was old and smelled"}
{"text":"Average Fatburger on the Vegas Strip. The only thing I liked was the outdoor patio that looked out to the strip and the space heaters to keep us toasty during the winter months. I'm not a fan of the service though. It seemed like the waitress was bitching at all her customers and basically encouraging them to leave. I'd come back for food or drinks but hopefully on a day that service is better."}
{"text":"The lack of concern about actually servicing customers is appalling, given there are many other places to eat in Sunset Station.  I'd prefer to give less than a one star rating, but your site doesn't allow that.

IMO, spend your money somewhere else..."}
{"text":"I guess extremely outrageous prices come with eating in a casino, but this place is just flat out ridiculous. It's fast food for Christ sake, not a pass to the holy grail. They sale burgers by the oz here. 

I think the flavor of the food is lost  because I can't get over what I just paid for a burger. Luckily I was smart enough to eat my buddies fries and drink a couple swigs out of his drink. 

The atmosphere of the place is really cool with pictures of old R&B artist, but there was no music playing. Eat before you head to the casino."}
{"text":"Seriously? I had a fat check they didn't honor it at all. Than I tried calling the Lady that manages all the fat burgers in Vegas and all of a sudden they want change there answer. The manager of this fat burger (older Hispanic lady) I guess doesn't care about her job, I saw her making my food with no cap on idk if she washed her hands and always has an attitude. I give tips for good service and you guys suck. Don't complain when you guys don't have a job cause your business runs out do to your sh$!?y service."}
{"text":"As a Chicagoan, and a big supporter of the hamburger stand cause in general, I feel it my responsibility to make Fatburger one of the first places I go to when in the southwestern region of our country, as we are woefully void of classic hamburger joints in the Midwest. Really we are - go to the Chicago Yelp page and look up how often this condition is brought up in the talk threads.

I love Fatburger, I really do. This might not make sense to those of you who can go here whenever you want, but I assure you, this place was a big topic of conversation when talking about our impending trip to Las Vegas. It's a great burger, in a clean environment, with friendly service and great music on the jukebox. What else do you need? Nothing, that's what I say."}
{"text":"Was there 6/16/16.  Used a groupon for drinks and fries.  Got burgers too, since needed the food anyways. Their burgers are awesome.  The service was great. Not so much divey bar.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Drinks were yummy too.  Try to go here everytime we come to vegas.  Highly recomend !!!"}
{"text":"This place is well worth the price. The burgers are incredibly tasty and unique in the contents. It fills me up and the shakes are pretty good too. 8/10 would eat lunch here again. Price is discouraging to people who've never eaten here before."}
{"text":"This is the third time I show up to this place and no one is to be seen in the morning I work grave yard so a good burger after work is what I want but they can't give it to me. Don't claim 24 hours you freaking retards!!"}
{"text":"I've come here three times now & I haven't even been able to eat anything.... why? Bc the asshats that work there never even acknowledged my existence in the drive thru!!!! I never got to place an order. I have a low tolerance for bullshit & this place is straight bullshit. Never again."}
{"text":"Because I'm a Cali girl and I grew up on this stuff we decided to stop by. The prices like any other place was really high. $22.00 for 2 people but okay. 

The guys working were extremely nice and gave excellent customer service! Burgers and fries were good like in Cali and the homemade milkshake was yummy too! 

Great choice for a spur of the moment dinner stop."}
{"text":"Fatburger, get the large burger with bacon, a handful of fresh veggies and a fried egg, your heart will hate you but you won't regret it.

After a late night of partying on the strip, my girlfriend and I, along with a buddy of mine, decided to check out FatBurger for a late night snack.

The atmosphere was really nice, its a fast food joint that looks like a diner serving up burgers made to order, pretty crafty!

Ordered their large 8oz burger with the works, cheese, fried egg and bacon with a side of fries.

I know it sounds like a lot but you live once, and you know what they say, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!

Burger was tasty but way too greasy, even if I were to take out the egg and bacon, by the time I got back to my hotel the bag was already soaked with grease.

It's awesome for those who want to try something new, they open 24/7 on the strip so its very convenient for those looking for a late meal.

I'd come back again if I'm hungry but definitely not something that I'd choose as a first option."}
{"text":"We purchased the $8 for $16 coupon & leaving the top half with code intact my wife cut off the very bottom thinking it unnecessary. Without any show concern they refused taking the voucher. The clerk asked manager & he confirmed this decision. The code would tell them everything needed knowing but even after ordering this technicality resulted in her denial & embarrassment. It's sometimes degrading enough using coupons without people using flimsy reasons for denial of their validity. Wouldn't Fatburger love seeing people walk away with nothing after investing this money in their product. I would never again patronize Fatburger at Green Valley Ranch. Reading other reviews I see many reviewers concur with my experience. There are much better hamburgers in the Las Vegas valley."}
{"text":"Food took too long.....and....
When we got it one burger was wrong other was cold.  Onion rings not cooked well either.  We asked for our money back and went to Jack in box instead
This place was a joke for the price and they had smart ass comments when we told the what was wrong"}
{"text":"Never again! I enjoy Fatburger as a chain but the one on the strip (not so much) as it does not have the same values as the ones in LA. The customer service is horrible and the wait time is unrealistic. The burger was not good, the credit card machine didn't work and the food again taste more like they cooked it and had it waiting for prep only. My review is only based on this one location in Vegas not the chain, I am a Raving Fan and will contine to enjoy Fat Burgers in LA."}
{"text":"With a town that's full of gourmet or \"upscale\" burger joints, and tons upon tons of fast food places, one could easily forget about Fatburger. And if they did, I wouldn't blame them. So far, my experiences at this burger franchise could be summed up by the following word \"Meh\"

I've been to a Fatburger in Vegas, and in many other cities as well. Nothing that I have consumed at any location has warranted another visit. Like mentioned before, with a dearth of burger places here, as the saying goes.. Beggars can be extremely choosey. ;)

But when that green-eyed monster commonly known as Groupon reared its head towards me offering me 50% off on food at this location, I had to oblige.

So with 16 bucks worth of Groupon money, I had to find a way to get the most out of this single visit. And they had that option for me.

XXXL burger - a 1.5 pound burger of massive proportions. At 12$, I opted to add toppings rather than go with the combo, so I added bacon, guacamole, and a fried egg. Every time I have ordered a burger at Fatburger, one thing has always resonated with me, it is dry. They grill it to order from a raw patty, and it's dry, every single time. The guac was pretty tasteless as well. The egg is cooked hard, which is pointless because the only reason to put an egg on a burger is to see the runny yolk ooze onto the patty. The only thing I liked was the bacon.

With a price point similar to smashburger, I'd rather go to smash. But I would save some dolla's even further and stick to the in-n-out. The only good thing about this place is that it's open 24/7. But if all the other places are closed and you really needed a burger at that hour... I guess it would be alright (but only in those circumstances)"}
{"text":"A bit on the expensive side for a fast food place, but the quality of food makes up for it if you aren't a fan of McJunk (and I am not).  

After a night out at the clubs, or working dealing with all of the myriad people out at night, sometimes one has to tear into something as substantial as a XXL to make it all worthwhile.  

The burgers are good and made to order, the shakes are decent (I like the Maui banana the best), and nothing tops off a giant meal like fat fries (eat them quickly as they are best while hot)."}
{"text":"So far, my husband and I have made it a point to eat at this Fatburger on the LV Strip every time we come to Vegas. We were recently in Vegas and ate here on May 28. The burgers are great and we always enjoy it. My only criticism is that the sweet potato fries aren't as sweet as I'm used to, but that was no biggie. It has outdoor seating and they bring your order to you. There is usually always a bit of a crowd, which lets you know it's good. It's open 24 hours which is always a plus in Vegas, and it's affordable. Considering that we don't eat beef, they still have good burger options, even for us! Fatburger is a must for us whenever we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Their famous Vegas slushies have no alcohol in them, just an unreal amount of sugar. The burger was good."}
{"text":"First tine at fatburger. 

Atmosphere: fast food Style restaurant 

Staff: friendly and prompt  

Food: burger was delish, bun was heavy in texture, fat fries (needed salt and lots of ketchup, still had very little flavor), soda fountain needed recalibrated (not enough flavor, too much soda water. )

Overall: I would eat it again, doubt I'd go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"If you like burgers, you're in Vegas and you've already been to In-N-Out, definitely give Fatburger a try.  Like In-N-Out the menu is simple yet tasty, but unlike the aforementioned burger mecca there are Banana shakes...awesome.  Being open 24 hours can be a good or bad thing, depending on who you are and whom you might be scared to see at 2 a.m....but then that kind of applies to the whole Strip, doesn't it?"}
{"text":"My meal was very good. It was a garden burger. Not greasy at all even though I added an egg. The fries were nice and fat. I remember eating fatburger In LA but the menu was way better here. Can't wait to try other items. 
Update. 
I've had the fat fries, sweet potato fries, skinny fried, onion rings and they are all good. Today I had the fat fries with cheese. :) I've had the French toast.. I can say mine is better. ;)"}
{"text":"I liken Fatburger to a more indulgent In-N-Out. It's fresh made-to-order burgers kicked up a notch (i.e. fat). 

Firstly, how do you pass by a place called Fatburger and not be curious? Needing a quick sustenance snack, I stopped in to find burgers ranging from Small to XXXL. \"Ummm yes I would like a small please.\" Many have tried to finish the XXXL in one sitting I was told by my enthusiastic cashier. How could they? It's the size of a baby's head! The slightly larger than a slider Small Fatburger was more than enough for my snack. It was juicy and I love that you know it was made fresh and cooked on the flattop right after I ordered it. 

If you're wandering along the strip, especially late at night, you might want to pop by Fatburger if you're looking for some nosh. Heck go buck wild and add bacon, cheese, and a fried egg while you're at it."}
{"text":"Jorge at the bar is awesome. Great service, great drinks. Stop by!! We we're checking out the Blvd. Food court and this place had sweet drink specials!"}
{"text":"My friend James and I are going to try the Fatburger due to Groupon promotion. 2 cheese burger and 2 small fries for $13.00. Not too shabby for this kind of promotional price. I substitute the beef patty into turkey patty for additional $1. Unfortunately, my turkey burger patty was too dry. The fries was perfectly cook, crispy outside not too soft inside. James ordered the chocolate strawberry mix milkshake. He said it was very strong flavour in it. Overall, I gave 3 out of 5 stars due to my dry turkey patty, and the restaurant concept was same as other American burger joint concept: Burger, fried food and milkshake. Nothing to spark my burger joint excitement. The remaining stars given to an awesome French fries and services."}
{"text":"\"Brunched\" at FatBurger after a late start to the day (who the hell is waking up early in Vegas anyway?!).  FATBURGER!!!  YUMMMMMYYYY!!!!

I remember ordering and the cashier suggesting I go all the way after I mentioned that I didn't want relish on my burger.  Thank you, Mr. Cashier!  The flavors on this \"fast-food\" burger go together like crazy!  The burgers are grilled to order and all of the toppings are fresh - probably because nothing gets a chance to sit around here.  The joint is jumping, we could barely find seats!

But back to the burger.  Just so fresh....and tasty......and not fast-foody, unsure of the meat species at all!  Fatburger is definitely all beef all the time.

And PLEASE don't get me started on the skinny chili cheese fries.  OMGeee!!!  I'm about to go on record as saying they were the best I've ever had...  At least definitely in recent memory.  Deliciously tart lemonade too.  Mmmm!!!

Dernit, now I've gotta make my way down to the one on South Beach.  Excuse me for a moment..."}
{"text":"Overpriced fast food in vegas. Their \"medium burger\"-which is TINY(seriously, not even the size of a jr burger at Mc D's) is so expensive. 

My husband and I ordered 2 medium burgers, 1 small french fry, and 1 soda. (I just had water). Our bill was 19$- Seriously!! 

I don't plan on going back to Vegas for quite sometime, but when I do, I won't be going back to Fatburger."}
{"text":"Yeah its a 5.00 for the \"fatburger,\" which wasn't that large- but it was good and the quality and flavor beats MCDONALDS next door. Although I find that the people who go here are ...well interesting is a nice way to put it."}
{"text":"This Fat Burger is constantly good. I eat here often. clean, friendly... burgers are always juicy can always count on a good burger. My only complaint would be the sometimes rotten egg smelll in the restaurant. But the food is great!"}
{"text":"This location is located on the strip and it get busy. When we went we had the super large drinks that were okay but the food was not that great. basic burgers, fries, and drink. Also very pushy staff to order up."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love my Fatburger!  The first time I had a Fatburger was at the Thunder Valley Casino near Sacramento.  The second time was at this location and it's always a late night snack after a night on the town.  

I guess by late night, I am not really picky about my food but when it is good, I got to give extra shouts out.  So this is to you, MY FATBURGER......."}
{"text":"I am genuinely the most easiest person to please. I always drove past this location and asked myself, \"Why have I NOT tried this place yet?\" 
 
We stood in line waiting to order and there was this elderly women in front of us who obviously was trying her best to take an order being it was her first time too, the cashier lady immediately got frustrated and scold the lady to pick up the tone of her voice because she couldn't hear her order.  
If that wasn't rude enough a drive thru asked for her assistants and she snapped at them telling them that she's occupied, \"Hold Up!\"

Then it was my turn to order. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and did my best to order... I decided on a medium burger, and she rudely told me... \"you mean the beef medium burger?\" Long story short because I don't want to write an essay...

If she didn't love her job find a new one... or if she was having a bad day? Take a moment to go and breath. There should be no reason for her to mistreat her guest. Especially when you never know who that guest could be. 

Food came out, we noticed she missed a lot of things we requested.... disappointed because the food was actually tastey."}
{"text":"Fatburger has never had a problem with burgers, which is why I pay what I do for them.  Tonight however, was the worst chili (not one of their staples per se but if you offer it, own it) I've EVER had on the chili cheese fries and chili dog we ordered.  Burned is an understatement as you will see from the pic and I will say no more other than very disappointing and a waste of money."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how awesome the bartenders were. Any time we go to Vegas we will be at this establishment. The burgers were mouth watering good. It was such a great place we went back for breakfast. Which was amazing!"}
{"text":"This Fatburger is always on point! Food is good and service is great. April has awesome customer service skills and suggested some add-one to our order to help our Fatburger cravings. This location is always courteous and fast considering that everything is made fresh. Will definitely keep coming and recommending this location to friends and family."}
{"text":"This Fatburger STEALS FROM CUSTOMERS!! I've never had such a bad experience getting fast food let alone from a Fatburger. When we got our food which was made unusually fast (when Fatburger makes everything fresh) we noticed the burgers were actually cold. So we parked, went inside and asked if everything could be made over since the fries would be cold by the time the new burgers were made. The shift leader then grabs their phone and walks in the back and has us waiting for about 10 minutes. We asked another employee what the hold up was and she tells us that they need to get approval from the owner. WHAT?? We hadn't touched the food at all. I've never seen or heard anything like this. But what happened next is really strange. He comes back and says they can remake the burgers, but not the fries. 

At this point I say I want a refund. I give him my card which he has for about 15 minutes. Once he comes back, he has a receipt for me to sign so the refund can go back on my card. The amount he has for the refund WAS LESS than the amount they debited. THIS FATBURGER FRANCHISE ARE THIEVES. 

This FATBURGER was dirty inside, they weren't even using Fatburger brown logo'd bags for the food and they seem to really lack franchisee health and quality standards. Also, to clarify they kept the money they owed me (A LITTLE OVER $8) with no concern or available recourse for me as a customer. 

I've contacted Fatburger corporate to inform them that this Fatburger rips-off customers and they're ruining the Fatburger name and should be terminated as a franchisee."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite to eat and was surprised to find out they had a brunch menu and $5 mimosas. I had the Eggs Benedict, which was pretty good. I would definitely have it again. The service was great and everyone working there seemed really nice."}
{"text":"Had the King burger today. For $7.99 it's one of the best burgers around. I noticed today they also sell a pulled pork sandwich which I'm going to try the next time I come here. I like the fact you can refill your drinks, and they have lemonade too !   If you have little ones they have a \"treasure Chest\" full of little toys ie; airplanes,stickers etc. they can pick from. I always go back to restaurants that treat our kids well.   Parents out there, you know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Good food!  The turkey burger with a egg and cheese and all the fixins and no relish is a prefect meal."}
{"text":"Picked up an order here for a delivery service.  They didn't begin preparing the order until I arrived, which was at least 15 min. after the order was placed.  The woman at the register didn't speak any English and didn't know how to find the receipt.  Once her manager found it for her and I began to walk back to my car, I realized they were missing the milkshake the customer had ordered.

Went back in, the woman made the milkshake (no apologies for missing it in the first place).  Then when I arrived at the home of customer, I discovered the lid was not secure on the milkshake and it had spilled all over the rest of the order.  Then he realized they'd forgotten the fries as well (how does a fast food burger joint forget the fries?).  I'd be surprised if he ever ordered from the delivery service again, but if he does, I hope he wouldn't order from Fatburger.  He was a lot nicer about the whole thing than I had any right to expect, but I was pissed off for both of us.

To sum up, they're careless, they don't care about customer service, and if they're not really stupid, they sure came across that way to me.  I know lots of people love the brand, but take my word: DON'T order via delivery service if you want any hope of the employees actually getting your order right."}
{"text":"I love fatburger always have-always will. They used to have a lot more locations open after midnight but not as many any more. Luckily I live close to red rock casino and the fatburger there is open till 2am. My favorite is actually their turkey burger.  Best one I'll had hands down. And don't forget the onion rings they take a little longer than the fat fries but are well worth the wait. This isn't news to anybody who's been to fatburger. If you don't know -now you know"}
{"text":"I must admit that I love Fatburger.  I like that there are so many topping options.  My favorite is the junior fatburger (think that's what it's called) with bacon and cheese added.  

While I like the burgers, I must admit that my real love affair is with the onion rings.  They are made from real onions & are made fresh daily (shocking, I know!).  The breading is cornmeal instead of the fish & chip like breading some places use.  

I keep going back to Fatburger because these are the best onion rings I've found."}
{"text":"The last time a friend brought me takeout it seemed like the quality had dropped - did not taste as good. I will reluctantly try them again, but it was off-putting so they have gone down a star. 

Previous Review. The Turkey, chicken and veggie burger are a treat for me. They have a great kids meal that my daughter loves. It is great they have a generous variety of menu options. My friends and family all have enjoyed the food. The ambience is a bit gimmicky and it can be a bit loud but they have won me over with consistent service and quality."}
{"text":"This location is a disgrace to Fatburger. Received absolute sh*t service with an attitude from Corrine. Then, after she screwed up my order, she argued with me that it was my fault (I'd be the first to admit if it was my fault, but it wasn't in this case). Everyone makes mistakes, but damn... Live up to them. Then they actually made me run a separate credit card transaction to add the slice of cheese they failed to add. Honestly everyone working at this location seemed to high or drunk to be able to concentrate on anything specific. I know complaining about a messed up order sounds petty - and I know how petty it is, but it was the being berated by the cashier that blew me away. When you're wrong, just say \"sorry\" and put the damn cheese on - don't argue with the customer. Won't be back to this location. Hit up one of the station casino locations instead. At the Red Rock Station location they are always friendly and the location is always clean and they don't all seem like they would set measurement records on a drug test."}
{"text":"Who ever says burgers or anything on their menu are good are all FAT LIE! 2 something dollars for a flat drink is unacceptable and everything are over prized! $4 for onion rings and oh 10 bucks for a plain burger kids meal?! Are you kidding me?! Definitely NOT coming back and absolutely not recommending this place."}
{"text":"I bought food via drive-through because my peeps and I had a late night craving to satisfy. I thought their name sounded honest and drove there to check it out. 

We ordered the classic Fat burger with a  shake, a western burger, and onion rings. I liked my burger well enough but it wasn't by any means dazzling. My friend said her western burger (not super sure the exact name of the burger) was okay. The onion rings held up well during the ride home and stayed crispy. The best part was the shake which was thick and creamy. 

I would likely hit it up again for casual dining. It's a solid 3.5 stars but I can't give that. They'll have to deal with a 3. I forgot to take pictures this time, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"On November 1st at 6:15 PM I went through your drive thru at the Flamingo and Rainbow location in Las Vegas Nevada. My family went to this location because after shopping at Smith's Food and Drug we received a coupon for a free medium fatburger with the purchase of a combo meal. The coupon has an expiration date of 12-31-2015 and is not the only coupon on the receipt tape. Upon ordering about $16 worth of food I mentioned the coupon. The woman working the drive thru asked if I had the whole receipt. I said no , I clipped your coupon. She said she won't take it because she needs to see the date on my receipt. I asked why since there is an expiration date for the Fatburger coupon and dots signifying to \"clip\" the coupon. The coupon doesn't mention that the whole receipt needs to be present for the offer. The coupon is also on a roll with other coupons for non affiliated businesses. Fatburger are you telling me that if I want to use your coupon I better use it before I use the other coupons? If I had eaten at Brooksy's the week before And their coupon was gone you wouldn't honor your coupon since the original receipt isn't intact? Your restaurant was dead and your drive thru empty. Are you really in a position to turn away coupons you personally put out? Hopefully this is the mistake of a poorly trained employee. I wouldn't doubt it considering when we ordered a number 1 combo (exact words) she asked if we wanted to make it a combo! I've never been a huge fan of Fatburger since this location seems to lack any sort of customer service."}
{"text":"Hello my name is Ocean Anders and I can't get that burger at exactly 12:15 PM and unbeknownst to me they had already closed hours before I had Yelp this particular location and found them to be open till 1 AM when I arrived at the destination they were fucking close. So if they say that there open till 1 am. They are lieing asswhole's"}
{"text":"If you are in a hurry I do not recommend this place. Overall it is a great atmosphere with a old diner feel right on the strip. You can sit outside at the fat bar with water missed and umbrella shade. Directly next-door to a pharmacy and drugstore if you need to pick up any additional items before heading to your hotel room. You will spend about $20 per meal for a burger, fries, and soda."}
{"text":"Sat outside enjoyed the view of the strip. Burger was great with fat fries. Service was quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"No beating around the bushes, it's a fat burger! They're not trying to make a healthy statement with grain free buns, organic ingredients or grass fed beefs, just a really good tasting burger. 

First of all, my fiends and I were staying in the central strip and so walking here made all the sense in the world. Can't comment on parking. I remembered my dad saying that this was one of their favorite burgers in Vegas. So I dragged my hungry friends for a ten minute walk just past Planet Hollywood. They kept saying let's just settle for this and that, but I said do you have this place where you're from??? Nope.

When we got there, at the entrance some guy passing out cards, gave us a BOGO drink coupon each for this place. Then we sat and waited. They don't have enough servers, and we were hungry. It was nice out, so we sat outside. 

Finally a pleasant server came and took our orders and honored our fresh BOGO cards, score! Then we waited. Finally our drinks arrived, nothing special just a draft beer, but something to keep us company while yet again waiting. 

Our burgers arrived, and I must say they are huge! I got a 1/3 pounder and one of my friends got the 1/2 pounder! It's not cheap, but for the size of this masterpiece I thought it was worth it. It was delicious, and filling. Didn't feel like I had to eat again for 4-6 hours later. 

Overall the burgers we all agreed were excellent in taste, freshness, and ability to fill you up. The restaurant itself was kind of dirty because they didn't clear tables quick so it would blow on the ground. The wait was something not everyone would tolerate so well, but if you want a good burger and don't want to break the bank, this is a great spot for that."}
{"text":"We walked in and they had Tupac playing on the radio. I knew it was about to be on and poppin!

I was hopeful that Fatburger would live up to the hype and give my beloved In-And-Out burger a run for it's money. Sadly, I wasn't horribly impressed. 

I went for the small cheeseburger and split and order of fries with friends. While the burger was definitely better than McDonald's or Wendy's or something, it wasn't amazingly life changing. I love the menu, the music and the overall experience of being at Fatburger, but I think I'll stick with my beloved In-And-Out. 

When we walked out of Fatburger, Pac was still bumping on the speakers. Gotta love it! Nonstop Cali love!"}
{"text":"Fabulous old school burger joint with lots of choice for toppings, different cheeses, onion rings, fries and poutine.

For those who don't want beef, chicken or turkey burgers are available. One of the best burgers I have had.

Its a bit more expensive than a typical fast food restaurant coming in at $12 all in but well worth every penny."}
{"text":"I am not sure what was wrong but the blond lady as a cashier was extremely rude. No customer service at all. She seem not to like the fact that we were coming in. Everyone seem to be nice but this lady was totally rude and i would never come here again. I love the food and the rest of the staff but she makes people not feel welcome. I love this burger place but i will just find a different location."}
{"text":"So bought drinks here paid for everyone's shot and tipped but I started to choke on my shot and threw up right after the bartender tried to go up to the rest of my party and tried accusing me of not paying  I tell him check the cameras he than accuses the next party that had just sat down not cool dude.what's up with bad employees in vegas trying to come up on tourist"}
{"text":"Its a good place with really delicious burger. Its just a little bit too expensive for my taste but the shakes are the best I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Everyone on the east coast has heard of In-N-Out or Jack in the Box. Its lesser known sibling Fatburger is worthy of recognition, however. A friend of mine hates In-N-Out and swears that Fatburger is the best, so he took us here. He pointed out their seasoned patty. Yum.... 

So the next time I ate at In-N-Out, I remembered the seasoned patty at Fatburger. Hm... I think I like them both equally. But I gotta admit, the Fatburger was pretty delicious. 

On the burger scale, it is as follows:
1. Custom Burger by Pat LaFrieda (still and probably forever #1)
2. 5 Guys
3. In-N-Out / Fatburger (tied)
4. Jack in the Box"}

{"text":"Decided to grab some eats at this local Vegas establishment at about 1am after watching a kick ass show. I grabbed the chili cheese fries and an a medium fatburger (with extra bacon and cheese). I liked that they didn't scrimp on the delicious,tasty chili on the fries and as for the burger, well, it was full of flavour, fresh, hot and really quite a great bite.

 A decent meal and a yummy conclusion to a hectic Friday night."}

{"text":"Great Classic Burger and an old time diner feel! Can be a bit inconsistent with over cooking the patties at times, but overall great job.  Love the unique chili and egg toppings and choice of skinny or fat fries."}
{"text":"All I wanted was a big fat burger, asked a few security and different people on the stripe the best place was sent here.  I walked in saw a group of firefighters there, so that was a good sign to see the locals still eat here.

My burger was actually two patties, which was fine. They were cooked excellently. I splurged the the $2 for bacon and cheese on my burger.  It was pretty messy, but what good burger with lots of fixings isnt?

I was a little disappointed in the onion rings. They were home made there, but fell apart easily and not all that flavorful.  

If you go, order a burger, stay away from the onion rings."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place and I have never been so disappointed, ordered 3 items and only got 1 out of the 3.. on top of that the one item was wrong and didn't come with what it said it did. When I called I was hung up on twice and when I was able to talk to someone they were extremely rude and unprofessional. I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"I might have missed the sign that said, \"No females allowed\" or the one that said, \"Big scary biker dudes only\".  Either way, it was a pretty intimidating burger joint to be hanging out in at 3am with a group of 24 year old ladies (all wearing outfits that could only be described as \"sparkly\" or \"glamorous\"). 

I ordered a regular hamburger and small fries.  It took approximately 20-30 minutes before my order was up!  I could have easily run back to the hotel, ordered room service, eaten, and paid my bill by then.  Or I could have easily taken in part of a magic show.  The wait brought new meaning to the term fast food, and not in a good way.

 When the food was finally done, it was burned dry meat.  The fries were on par with McDonalds, but the place was so dirty I didn't even want to put anything near my mouth.

One side note: somebody was feeding their baby there!  What?!  At 3am at a dirty burger joint with scary biker dudes?  That baby had the biggest bags under her poor little eyes.  Good grief Charlie Brown!

I would never go back."}
{"text":"Good burgers for sure and by good I mean tasty, sloppy and juicy.  Just the way I like it.  The fries they serve are always piping hot and cooked perfectly.  

Our timing must have been good because we were seated quickly during a busy period and although our food took a little time it came out hot and delicious - both the fries and the burgers.  

We observed the manager and he was one busy guy, keeping everyone and everything in order, not to mention the big smile he had on his face when he greeted us.  

We were impressed by the whole experience."}
{"text":"The burger brigade conquers yet another burger baron foe (that soon after became a friend), that of new-ish Fatburger in Thornhill.

The location is in off of the Disera Drive faux neighbourhood complex they've built just across Centre Street from Promenade Mall (seriously, it looks like a tiny historic neighbourhood with lots of walking paths, street parking, street level shops - ingenious really for the burbs).

Now the menu is MASSIVE, every kind of burger (beef, double beef, double double beef, chicken, fish, turkey, etc, etc), chicken tenders, onion rings, soft drinks, lemonades, chilli, fresh made chips, every kind of french fries.... it goes on and on, something for everyone.

I went with the Fat Cheeseburger, which was 2 6oz patties on a bun with every topping standard (the standard for any of their burgers with the Fat-prefix), I added some double thick cut bacon and some special sauce. Our group split a lumber jack poutine, regular fries and their house made chips. Now the burger itself I would give maybe a 2.5 or a 3 star MAX. It was (in my opinion) overly seasoned with black pepper, and overly cooked. I like a little pink or a little juice. I found it a tad try and it needed the toppings to be complete.

The sides and service were top notch however, and staff were clearing our garbage away within seconds of being finished, I thought this was a nice touch for a fastfood joint. Big points for this guys well done.

They have Amsterdam 416 coming in on draught soon, so make sure you check them out. This was an OK spot that if you're nearby I'd suggest checking out, but not something really worth trekking across the burbs for. 

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"No thanks to Dollar car rental, we got to my friend's house in Vegas at 3 PM (after a 12:45 flight arrival) and by that time we were freakin' starving.  Fatburger to the rescue!

Got a standard cheeseburger and fries.  It was good, but I wish someone had told me the skinny fries are coated fries -- yech.  The burger was a wee bit overcooked and dry.  Maybe we should have eaten them there instead of taking them back to her house, but it wasn't THAT far away.

Had to go, though, 'cause I can go to In-n-Out any day but there's no Fatburger in my hometown..."}
{"text":"Was good. Vegas strip  is so busy we got it to go. So by the time we got bk to the resort food was cold. I'd suggest to eat it at the location."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the burger joint. The sandwich was great and to be honest leaves you wanting more. I enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"In-n-out ??? Smashburger ? Fatburger

'nuff said"}
{"text":"wow! had their XL burger with cheese & bacon.  A BIG, gooey, sweaty, double-fisted mound of awesomeness! Yes, I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Located in GVR, it's one of the options in their food court.  

I was with some friends and we wanted to grab a quick bite.  Service was good.  We sat at the counter in front of the cooks and they were all very friendly and chatty.  

It was my first experience eating a fatburger and probably my last.  I ordered the small burger and skinny fries.  The taste of the burger was too salty.  Good thing I had water to help it go down.  I was really disappointed with it.  The skinny fries were good.  Crispy and a good amount.  

Fortunately there are other good places to eat in GVR.  As far as Fatburger, thumbs down."}
{"text":"Gluttony at its finest. This account is from my first and final trip to Fat Burger on the LV strip.

The second night of the girls' 21st birthday trip to Vegas was supposed to be our night to party hardy. Fat Burger brought all that to an abrupt halt. We spent the day at the Mandalay Beach, sun bathing and sipping on Long Islands and planning our evening. We then ate at Raffles cafe, drank some more, went to the room and cleaned up, drank some more, then hit up the Vodka Vault at Red Square, Ghostbar, Moon and Playboy and drank at each of those along the way. What... we were thirsty?

Hungry and desperate, we decide to get a snack before heading to the next clubs we had planned on, Tryst and Drais. Fat Burger put a halt on those plans because Tryst was scratched altogether and only half of us even made it to Drais.

Mistake: two of the four BZs ordered burgers bigger than they could handle.

Result: instant food coma, cranky and bitchyness. The two wanted to go home an sleep, thus foiling our big late night plans (now that our taxi rides would cost double and the fact I had to give some creepy promoter my cell phone number, for the greater good of the group, to get free guestlist at Tryst).

The service was S L O W, albeit, a lot of drunk people were there just around 12 midnight and the cooks were probably backed up a little. We had eaten probably 6 hours earlier so we needed to refuel. We must've waited at least 20 minutes for our orders.

OK, not so bad right? Wrong. One of the girls had severe implications from the FAT burger for the remainder of the weekend into Tuesday.... savage diarrhea and constipation. Trust, though it wasn't ME, we all had to suffer because she was queasy and cranky and was blowing up our hotel room's toilet at all times we were in the room. And boy, that bathroom door was paper-thin because we could hear it all. But we wont go there.

Fat Burger, thanks for being there, but never again. I'll stick with what I know and go to In-n-Out."}
{"text":"Not great. Spend your money elsewhere. Super pricey not worth it. Won't be back. Service is great though lol"}
{"text":"The customer service is crap. They are super slow at orders. I physically watched the guy making burgers taking his sweet time with a million people waiting. I'm unsure as to how these people have a job at all honestly. I was going to wait until I ate my food to review it but I'm so annoyed at this point the food can not be worth this long of a wait on top of rude employees."}
{"text":"Came in at 4am. My friends were pretty drunk but they handled us perfectly. Shay went above and beyond which is really so unnecessary at a fast food place in Vegas at that hour. The manager that was ringing  (I didn't see his name tag) was also super accommodating. I don't really eat fast food but they made my experience great. Really thank you guys! You were amazing!"}
{"text":"So when we came the first time the service was great , today was horrible thanks to a slow rude Jackie. First she overlooked us for about 20 minutes then took our drink order and came back another 20 minutes later. Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back! I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk."}
{"text":"Fat Burger is one of those places I always go to when I'm in town.  They have awesome burgers and fries that are made right in front of you, Subway-style.  Prices are about right for a whole meal, and since they're located near ASU, there's plenty ofcollege flavor to go around here.  Their menu is basic, but I would say that Fat Burger is comparable to Seattle's Dick's.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The name goes with the menu. Fat burger has really fat burgers. It is one of my favorite burger spots. and I go here once every time I'm in Vegas. The outdoor seating area surrounding the bar is pretty cool. Grab a beer and watch a game on the screen while you enjoy their fat juicy burger. It's an experience I enjoy every visit and you should too."}
{"text":"fatburger serves a solid, no nonsense burger, that is customizable with condiments and toppings to your hearts content. the patty is relatively loose ground beef, and cooked to a slight crunch.
this used to be the only game in town for a good burger, but now with burger bar, BurGR, B&B, and others, this place is losing it's appeal. they've turned the outside into more of a bar area, but it seems like the quality might have gone down. my last couple burgers here do not seem as juicy as the fatburger's of memory. i would personally rather go to either burger bar or B&B over here, but if it's convenient, i still stop by from time to time."}
{"text":"Burger tasted pretty plain. Might have been better with bacon, but I definitely prefer Smash Burger."}
{"text":"I discover the FATBURGER while doing business in Sin City! Yuck, that city full of sin for sure!! But FATBURGER was so so tasty treat to me for lunch.  Turkey Burger and fry from FATBURGER (oh I love saying the name... make me so silly saying that!)  French fry is my second love food *faint* yes, french fry and the hot Calamaris are favorite! 

The worker there moves very very fast... down to a science in the operation.  People come from near and far to visit the FATBURGER and the line can be long! But do not be discouraged... STAY IN LINE! you will be served quickly!!!  Boodah has no idea what they put on the FATBURGER but it make me feel like little baby.  

Simple, 50's style decor that remind you of diner experience.  Lots of soul music figure on wall and playing on jukebox.  Marvin Gay? on when I went first time, enjoy very much.  I tell you... the Turkey FATBURGER like eating narcotic burger... you cannot get enough!  As you can see, there is plenty of auto-love for the FATBURGER!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the crew is usually to lazy to make half of it. And I've never gone through the drive thru without them forgetting something from my order."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 sandwiches and fries. Got all the way home(5 miles) and missing a sandwich. My options were credit..pick it up or have my name put down for another time. So i am hungry and you screwed me over. So i drive the 10 mile round trip to pick up a cold fat burger and was handed a 10% coupon off my next visit. How nice of you too have us drive 20 miles for a place that smells like sewer..is far from clean and that 10% wow thats a little bit much for all you put my visting company from Michigan through?? I would expect this from McDonalds but not Fatburger."}
{"text":"It's BS that this joint is mentioned as a viable eatery option when in downtown Phoenix when unless there is a game going on - it's NOT an option !!!"}
{"text":"It's a fast food inside a casino, what do you expect?  There wasn't anyone in front of me, yet it still took them like 10 minutes to cook my burger and fries.  They don't have any combo prices, everything is a la carte.  I think I will go somewhere to eat before I step into the casino."}
{"text":"This location is so sluggish. I've eaten here a few times but I feel like I've made more attempts to eat here that have failed. Sometimes the drive through line will simply not move five, ten, and even once, 15 minutes can go by without the car in front of you moving. Shame."}
{"text":"Thought we'd give it a try thinking we would get a bogo drink but when we got in they said it was for bar only...oh well we here now so let's try it I had a chicken sandwich 7.80 no fries hubby had a Double cheeseburger 14.10 fries 3.65 2 drinks 6.20.... yeah they're a bit expensive but it's VEGAS right.? However I must say it was very delicious and fresh and a very plentiful portion *burger patties are thicker than they appear"}
{"text":"Just finished up a meal here with my husband. Neither of our burgers came with correct toppings and my husband didn't get the dipping sauce he asked for until he got up and asked for it at the counter. We were one of 4 tables seated in the restaurant and every single order that was brought out was incorrect. The burgers were decent, but again, not delivered how they were ordered. His sweet potato fries were fine, my onion rings left much to be desired. We won't be back. With so many options in the area, Fatburger needs to step it up (especially for the price- $33 for poor quality and attention to detail)."}
{"text":"I've passed by this burger joint a number of times before actually going in one day. First impressions are: Once you walked in, it is super narrow, and there is bar- like seating to the right that looks like just about the only seating they have. However when you walk past the washroom there is a dining area that is acceptable. 

The menu consists of burgers and the misc items that normally go with burgers like fries, milkshakes, onion rings, poutine etc. They had some gourmet add-on's too like guac, etc. The burgers were a nice thickness, tasted homemade and more authentic then other fast food burger chains. The fries and onion rings were nothing to write home about. 

I went with two other people, and we ordered 2 beef burger combos and 1 turkey burger with a milk shake and the bill came to over $60. Fat burger? More like Fat wallet. 

I wouldn't come back here again unless someone twisted my arm and said I had to. 

Verdict: Save those McD coupons.

              You're better off at Five Guys or South Street."}
{"text":"My friend heard great reviews of this place, so we decided to eat here for lunch while on vacation. I ordered the medium cheeseburger and onion rings. My meal came up to $16 (I had lemonade too). The burger was underwhelming. The burger was tart and pickley. The onion rings were plain and nothing special. I had buyers remorse throughout the entire meal. Just get a double double from In & Out. Pretty sure I'm not coming here again. (There is a bar outside, so maybe if you drink enough the food will taste better?)"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. Walked in with my boyfriend and didn't even get a hello. We stood at the cash register waiting to order for about 10 mins. Note, there was NO ONE in front of us. Three customers in the lobby. One lady sitting with her child and 2 others waiting for food. They messed up the lady and child's order. They took 30 mins to give the other people their to go order. One lady asked for a refund because she waited 30 mins to get ONE burger. They gave her the refund. The other lady is STILL waiting. No sure how long she was there. Finally the manager Manny took our order. He actually rolled his eyes at US for our choices that we put on our burger. I got my receipt, and looked at it and it turns out my order was wrong. I told him I didn't order an egg on my burger (which cost $2.00 to add on btw) He didn't offer a refund or anything, nor an apology. Finally, the other lady who was STILL waiting got her food gets her order. And guess what?! HER food was wrong too! They messed up 3 orders back to back, so I requested a refund. I ended up waiting for almost 30 mins as well. The manager then says I am waiting because my \"burger has an egg on it,\" which I already told him that was incorrect. The girl in the back named Brittany started laughing. I told her it's not funny that you all have messed up 4 peoples food back to back and my total was $26.00. I actually have called Fatburger Corp. and spoke to the VP of Operations regarding this. I encouraged him to look at this yelp page to see how his store is doing."}
{"text":"The amount of late night spots that I am starting to Yelp, makes me thing I should create a list. Fatburger deserves a place at that table!

Having lived in SoCal for a number of years, and now, once again, Sin City, Fatburger is a staple for late night grub. The location on the strip is open 24/7 and is the perfect choice when you are trying to nurse yourself into zombie mode. I say that because, sometimes, Vegas can be too much fun, and you are near a coma-tose point. 

Being a Zombie would take some sort of miracle. Fatburger, can be that miracle.

On my way home from the club the other night, I got hungry. There really isn't too much in the way of convenience at 5am near my place (I can't wait to move to the Strip). Thankfully, this Fatburger location popped up like an oasis in the desert.

Feeling \"healthy\", I decided to order the Turkey Burger. With Bacon. Clearly, I wasn't in the right frame of mind, but whatever. It was late.

Yeah, it was delicious, amazing, and the whole nine yards but the reason I give this place Four Stars is simple. Convenience, speedy service, and a clean restaurant.

Done and done."}
{"text":"Tried fatburger for the first time tonight. I couldn't believe how expensive and how slow it was. $20 for my husband and I and we probably waited a good ten minutes just in line to order with one person in front of us. Burger was good and much bigger than typical fast food (1/3lb). Fries were ok but I wasn't crazy about them. Overall I was impressed and wouldn't go again as there are many better burger options around."}
{"text":"Ready for some food this am. Gonna be a good burger. It was so good we went two days in a row for breakfast. Had hamburger and fries one day and eggs bacon and potatoes the next day. And it was reasonable prices. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting!! The meat was burnt, and it was horrible. Didn't taste good at all. Will never be back"}
{"text":"A great, fast easy lunch option on strip.  Of course not as good as In N Out but it will do. Way better than the MGM and NYNY food court options. ( Nathan's, I;m talking to you, a mediocre $12 chicken sandwich is robbery....)"}
{"text":"Come here for the burgers!  That's it!  Just come here for the burgers.  If you can get it to-go, then even better.  I've come to Fatburger many times in previous trips to Vegas and there are 3 things that are consistent:

1- The burgers are bomb!  I always get an XL Burger which is 8oz. with everything plus bacon.  If Im really starving then I add an egg which is $0.99.  Awesome burger!  Cooked fresh and juicy.  

2- This place is always dirty!  And when I say dirty, the tables are always dirty, the floors and especially the bathroom.  This time around the mensroom looked like someone threw up everywhere but in the toilet.  Gross!  

3-  The cooks are lively, but the other employees who walk around doing whatever job their doing always look upset and disgruntled.  

But other than that, great burgers!"}
{"text":"Ordinarily I wouldn't come to an establishment that looks really seedy but it was across the street from the Mandarin Oriental where we were staying and we wanted something quick and cheap for lunch.
Outside it looks a bit creepy; inside they played Biggie Smalls and the the people working there were really into the music. It does have a somewhat fun atmosphere if you're into that workers being loud, but that's not my type of crowd. 

We got a XXXL Burger, fat fries and a Chili Cup and brought it back to the hotel. The burger was huge, but it was over $9. It was difficult to pick up so we basically just took it apart. My friend ate most of it, but from what I had it was a decent burger -- better than the typical fast food restaurants available to new yorkers at least. I have yet to try In-N-Out, so I can only compare it to places like McDonald's or Burger King. The chili was really salty, but we ate it with the fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. 

The food is better than your average fast food restaurant, i.e. Wendy's, McDonald's, etc but it's not as clean, so I'm not comfortable eating there and the clientele's too rowdy at night, but I'll gladly get it to go."}
{"text":"Discussed with their service!!!! They not only screwed out order. When we go home, the charges is for 4 cheese burgers and extra for cheese and only 1 person had cheese. We called and they acted like they could not understand what we were saying. They had the audacity to ask the person prepping the food of they forgot the cheese as if we were lying. Horrible establishment and will never go back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After working a long shift at the hospital all i2 wanted was a good filling burger. Headed to the fatburger. The guys who was on the night shift around 6/26 1030p was amazing. The cashier who took my order was super friendly. And the cook made my burger perfect. We stepped away to gamble and the cook brought it right to our table. And I ate every bite. I watched them as I ate and their service was superb. I'll definitely be back to this location. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Ordered through ubereats at 8:08pm expected arrival time 8:27pm...well that was a fail! Reordered again , expected time 8:41pm and it was still a big fail!!!! Ordered a turkey burger, specifically marked what I want on my sandwich and still a fail!!! Crap! Never going to this pace anymore! Great driver but not the delivery time."}
{"text":"I've never written a review on Yelp, but this place compelled me to write my first one.

This place gave me a severe case of the stomach flu. 

I've never tried Fatburger in my life. So earlier today I was craving for a burger and passed by this one and saw it as a good opportunity to try one. Horrible experience. 

First, the food here was ridiculously overpriced. Call me cheap, but I consider paying close to $15 for a burger, a drink, and onion rings grossly overpriced. Secondly, the girl that took my order got my order wrong and didn't even give me the fries I ordered. Third, the girl that gave me my food first asked me if I wanted ketchup, to which I replied \"yes please\", and then proceeded to hand me a bag of food that I later found out contained no ketchup whatsoever. Fourth, the food itself was quite mediocre, at best. The burger was dry, and the onion rings were drenched in oil and tasted more like oily onions than onion rings. The only decent thing was the sweet green tea.

Lastly, and this is the major one, this place gave me gastroenteritis. For those who don't know what this is, it's the stomach flu. How do I know it was Fatburger's fault? because it was the first and only thing I ate today, and I didn't even have dinner last night. It started with some major diarrhea, led to severe stomach cramps, and ended with me in the ER at 3 in the morning. I can almost guarantee you that Fatburger either didn't cook or wash the meat thoroughly or some part of the food was contaminated. 

If you don't like expensive burgers, getting your orders wrong, dry burgers, oily onion rings, diarrhea, or stomach cramps via the stomach flu, then I HIGHLY suggest you stay away from this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and fries. OMG.
My son and I stopped by here on our first night out on the Strip. I wasn't expecting much cuz it looked shady outside but what a pleasant surprise! Delicious and everyone was great."}
{"text":"This location was a fail for us.  The area isn't bad but the restaurant was pretty worn and smelled bad.  Customers were very rough.  We were called for our food and handed the waaayyyy wrong order.  We tried to tell the employee but they took off and ignored us for a while.  Finally got our correct order...Asked for no pickles and no onions.  Got onions and no relish but plenty of pickles.  I really like Fat Burger but this location may just need to be avoided."}
{"text":"I heard good things bout Fat Burger before, so we finally tried Fat Burger for the first time.  Food was A-OK.  Nothing special.  Unimpressed at all.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Was super stoked vegas had a fatburger so that I could finally try it!

Eh it's not an LA location so I'm not gonna judge them completely off this one. The burgers here though just weren't that great. It was pretty expensive and didn't have much flavor and wasn't juicy at all. 

In n Out is sooooooo much better and a lot cheaper...at least compared to this location. Highly suggest that people go there instead if wanting something a bit more quick. 

If you do come here though they usually have a groupon so check!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to have lunch here.  The location is fantastic; there's patio seating right on the strip and plenty of televisions playing the Sunday games.  The burgers, beer, and service were all really good."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 burgers and 2 fries w/2 sodas for $39.

That is a crazy price for 2 people, could have gone to Red Robin and had endless fries and service for that price but we were there and we knew the prices before hand.   

The sweet potato fries were unevenly cooked, some were underdone, some were done just right and some were way over cooked and hard...so that was not a good experience.

The burger I had was good, I liked it.  It wasnt worth $8 or whatever it cost, it was very expensive and mind you, I only got the medium.  My Uncle who was visiting in town for the weekend ordered a chicken sandwich, its small (Medium)  looked small to me, we could have gone to Mcdonalds.    

So...The burger was good but go to Red Robin.  Seriously, why pay $39 for 2 burgers?"}
{"text":"I was in the area, so I decided to give it another shot.  This time I got the large combo and the patty was bigger and fatter, but still tasted pretty lackluster.

What a waste of 12 bucks."}
{"text":"Went to the late night window and there is one person working. There were two people in line for food. I waited ten minutes at the order menu and couldn't even get an order placed. Left and went to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the biggest ripoff on the strip!  Very, very mediocre burger at an outrageous price.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one."}
{"text":"I was dying to try this place. My man and I made it our first food stop in Vegas, and I'd have to say it was just ok. It reminded me of Wendy's, but with a longer wait time and a seedier crowd. I didn't want to put my purse on the dirty floor for fear of theft, so I kept it in my lap. All this did was make me look like I was afraid, and you never want to show fear. I put it on the table.

Other posters have commented that the best bet is In-N-Out, but I also think their burgers taste like Wendy's. 

My man really wants to eat here again when we return to Vegas at the end of the month, but I'm going to drag him to BLT Burger."}
{"text":"A West coast original! Fat Burger is home of the biggest, juiciest, \"slap your momma\" (please don't slap your moma-she slaps back and your dad gets mad), burgers. 

One of the first minority owned chains, now around the world. From small to the massive XXXL( don't let your wife know you ordered one), the burgers are always fresh beef. Now, there is chicken and turkey, if you like vegetables. :)

Milk shakes are made from scooped ice cream! Yum."}
{"text":"So good! The outdoor bar is the best! You can order food while sitting, drinking, and enjoying the views of the strip. The staff and bartenders have always been super helpful everytime I've been. Great late night spot to get your drunken eating on."}
{"text":"Why don't you try Fat Burger from now on? You can get can get a cheese and fries for 2.95....."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money here at this location. Sincerely just order through Grubhub and it arrived with a driver who looked like he was high as a kite. So that is the first disappointment next beening the fact when I ate into my chicken sandwhich it was RAW! Upon calling the store itself I spoke with an unidentified worker claiming to be the manager. When I told her what had happened she said I could come in Yes drive to the place when I already ordered thru grubhub and tipped the driver, but you want me to drive 4 miles roundtrip for a chicken sandwhich? So NO! If my car wasn't dead I would have because I was intending on eating and being satisfied. Her suggestion was to then contact grubhub for a refund. The most frustrating aspect of it all is upon the conversation with the supposed manager she knew from my description of my burger which one it was but was only ready to remake it tonight at her convenience not the paying customers some management team you got! Anyways 86 that location Go To RedRock Casinos Fatburger waaaaaaaaaay better!"}
{"text":"This is the worst fat burger in Las Vegas. I eat at fat burger 2-3 times a week, and the costumer service in this place is horrible. I don't know how this store stays open."}
{"text":"Love the burgers here.  So flavorful and juicy.  The one lb burgers is plenty to split between two people"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place after reading multiple reviews of diners getting food poisoning but the BBQ restaurant next door was closed midday. For some reason with no notice so I decided to give Fat Burger a try. Slightly torn on this review as my meal was decent but my wife's was extremely disappointing. Overall I do not think there is much value in this restaurant. Burgers are on the expensive starting around $10 and up. Nice decor with some history of the franchise on the walls, apparently a popular chain from California back in the old days but that must've been quite a long time ago. I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger with fries and drink (unlimited refills) and my wife ordered the turkey burger. The mushroom Swiss was moderately sized, nothing crazy about and to be honest I expected more size for the price but the burger was pretty standard similar in taste to Wendy's but much more expensive. My wife's meal was disappointing, the turkey burger patty was very very small and thin almost like a wafer and it was overcooked to a dark brown leaving it very dry and unpleasant. Her burger was 80% bun to be honest. We will not be going back and I don't think it is really worth the value or a try in my opinion. There are many better burgers in the city."}
{"text":"Solid burger joint. We came with a Groupon ($16 for 2 burgers and regulations fries) so it was fairly priced but if it wasn't for that I'd say it was expensive. I mean two burger meals go for $22 +tax. For a fast food joint I'd say that's a little too much. Personally if it wasn't for the Groupon (even though the service was excellent) , I wouldn't come here again (mainly due to price). 

Pros
Good fresh food
Yam fries are great 
Generous portions
Good service 

Cons
Much too expensive for a fast food joint 
Nacho fries aren't that good"}
{"text":"Good burgers done on the flat top grill, resulting in crunchy edges and a nice sear. Get your burger or chicken sandwiches hot and fresh, made to order in a custom size with an adequate choice of toppings, sauces and garnishes, hot or chilled and fresh.

The ladies working the counter and grill are friendly and efficient. There is usually plenty of seating for solos, couples and small groups. It's not a new location, so don't expect glamour, but it's usually tidy. 

We order the meal deal, with a drink and fat steak fries (or skinny fries).  It's not cheap fast food--one medium burger meal and one large burger meal will cost more than $20. Expect a short wait since your burger is cooked to order, not premade and sitting under a heat lamp."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is great. Service is great. Way better than the rest of the fast food chains. A must place to eat."}
{"text":"For starters i haven't had fat burger in a few years. I walked in the store and the pos system was down so they had to write my order down, I got the honey garlic crispy chicken and a side of onion rings the chicken was rubbery and I don't think it was cooked fully through because of the texture, way too much honey garlic sauce it made the chicken breading soggy or maybe that was because the meat wasn't cooked all they way either was it was a disgusting mess. The onion rings must have been cooked at a low temp in dirty oil because it was like an old nasty crunch and oily at the same time. I heard no sizzling coming from the fryers. I threw it all away and ate left over from the fridge. Thanks for a horrible experience. I used to love fat burger now I don't think I can ever eat there again. I'd give a half of a star if I could. Or none at all."}
{"text":"Placed order online so when I got there it would be ready to go since Fatburger is usually slow to get your food out. When I got there my food hadn't even been started yet. I had to do order over again. She asked me to pay and I told her I paid online. She said she didn't have a record of that and wanted me to pay again. I showed her my bank account on my phone so she could see the money was taken out. She still wanted me to pay again. I told her to cancel the order and I just went to the pizza place next door."}
{"text":"The burger was good although it took awhile for them to make it (one burger). Considering that it took awhile, we expected them to have the correct order. The burger had to be redone since they added all these ingredients that should have not been included in the first place. Again, it took awhile. Overall, our experience was average."}
{"text":"Okay place. Nothing extravagant. It is expensive  for burgers though. 2 medium burgers with cheese, skinny fries, and onion rings = $17.88. 

Come to try if you need a quick bite.  Cooked well, onion rings rocked, burgers were burgers.

Great alternative to In and Out Burger as well, and way less busy!"}
{"text":"Better than McDonalds! The fat fries are enough to make you want to eat at this place. This burgers are always juicy and perfectly melts in your mouth. A bit pricey for a burger joint, but definitely worth it. 

Our friends make it a breakfast burger by adding an egg to it. Strange, but they make it look DELISH!"}
{"text":"This is a very clean fatburger, and has bery polite service, I jabe been coming to ghis one for a number of years. My only issue is they dont always keep there lemonade filled"}
{"text":"I had been interested in trying fatburger for a while. We came in at about 8 PM, the service was good, the guy working the register was cheerful. Overall a solid experience, although the burger should have been outstanding and it was not. Condiments were spot on, patty was not especially flavorful but still delicious. I can respect an establishment that doesn't freeze their meat. Bun was dry. I think if I had ordered some cheese it would have been better. 

Fries came out hot and were good, but not great. I figure if I can get a more satisfying burger and In N Out for half the price Fatburger as a franchise needs to try harder. 

Again, I thought the employees were friendly and knew what they were doing, just the food wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"Great Steak Fries and Exceptional Banana/Strawberry shake. I received Amazing! Customer Service from Kathy today, and they are lucky to have a quality employee like her!"}
{"text":"I only went here because of that Beastie Boys lyric:  buy a Fatburger when when he's way out west. Never again. Cheese is extra, on the already expensive burgers. 26 bucks for 2 medium cheeseburger meals. And not better than say, Wendy's. And holy crap, I thought they would come out with cobwebs on them it took so long. This location also seems delapidated. Nope, sorry Beasties, you are wrong on this."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and fries!!! Customer service is world class! Friendly cashiers and cooks!"}
{"text":"Dang, where is the crackhead ghetto speaking midget counter guy as was described in another review?  I was hoping to take a picture of said employee because it was a hot day (102 degrees) and I was ready to unload some insults at someone.  Instead, we have a cool, nice, and efficient counter guy.  Did they have the nerve to fire above midget?  Or did he leave for a better paying gig? Aw dang, normal hard working people are so...boring.  So, anyway, I settle for a medium burger with the works but no egg or chili.  My brother had the same thing

I wasn't there when the previous yelpers had a bad experience.  But we clearly enjoyed ourselves. Based on those previous yelp reviews, I also didn't want to get food poisoning so I watched them make it from start to finish.  To my surprise they were actually very clean on a Saturdahy night at 7 PM.  In 10 minutes, the guy brings out our tray.  Now I am a clean table freak at time.  So of course, I had to wipe down the table we were sitting in even though the table looked clean.  I do this all the time. 

So I take a picture and take a first bite of the burger.  Very good...hot patty nicely grilled with a pile of letttuce, tomato, mayo, and mustard.  The bun was grilled, too which is important to me.  Who wants floppy buns?  

Then I take a taste of the crispy, greasy, sweet onion rings.  Its was a 3.5 burger but 4.5 onion rings this time.  Both were just cooked and just fine.  While people in the casino said words like \"Da!! I lost my money\" we said, \"Yum, we're gaining calories with a Fatburger fat burger\" and it was good. With a soda, it's over 12 dollars, a lot more pricey than In N Out, a 5 star place for me most of the time.  This was a 4 star trek for some decent burger and 0-rings, and hope my luck doesn't run our either with the good burgers and casino if I ever gamble."}
{"text":"It was very good and the store was clean I am puzzled by the bad reviews I eat a lot of burgers I will be back"}
{"text":"Liked it a few years ago but the last time I went food was tasteless. More expensive than five guys and five guys blows fat burger away IMO"}
{"text":"My family and I came in here thinking it was going to be a quick and cheap dinner... Wrong! We spent $90 and waited 50 mins for our food. We ordered 5 burgers, 4 fries, and 2 shakes. I would've got faster service and cheaper food if I would've drove 10 mins out of this area. Disappointed, dissatisfied, Never again."}
{"text":"Good, filling, decent variety. Service is simply fine. 3 stars because its chain/franchise diner with hefty prices."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great Food Great Service. Get a Groupon! It totally helps with the $$$"}
{"text":"The fries and the onion rings are the bomb! Love my fat bacon burger! The best part this place is dog friendly! Yes, we brought our little dog to Vegas! They gave our little dog a little bowl of water! They were nice and caring service! My margarita was good!"}
{"text":"Walk in n seat yourself and a server will bring menus. This is my fave casual spot to rest my feet n grab a bite of burger, hot dog, BBQ tossed wings. 

Food is generally mediocre and slush drinks n cocktails are weak (ordering beer is your best bet) but the location is prime. That's why Fatbar is set up by the sidewalk to catch foot traffic.

However, ongoing construction nearby disrupts people watching and kinda ruins the Vegas vibe."}
{"text":"Ate here twice the past week.  Ok, not great.  Cheeseburger was good.  Expect to wait for food which is fine, they cook to order so your burger is fresh. Thick fries were nothing special.  Staff here are great.  Extremely friendly and courteous.  Staff gets 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.. I ordered the \"fat salad\" and recevied shredded taco lettuce with an abused looking tomato on top. I thought it was a joke.  In addition, I FOUND A PICKLE IN MY SALAD!!! EWWWW! IM F@#KING ALLERGIC!.. I was sooo infuriated. i politely asked the employees did pickles come with the salad, they laughed and replied \"no\". i showed them what I found, and they laughed even more (i didnt find anything funny).  so I took a picture (please see uploaded post of salad w/pickle--if the following has not already been deleted by their request) for my own evidence, and the manager excuse was \"it gets pretty busy, so our cooks can be clumsy\"  im standing there puzzled like really?!?!!? did you just say that to a customer?!?!?!?! I recevied a refund, and will never return."}
{"text":"OK I get that if you eat too many Fatburgers, you will get fat. But at least, you'll be fat and happy.  I've recently re-discovered how good this burger can be. My relatives go to this Texas Station Casino now and then and try to beat the gambling odds and Gods. But after gambling if they have money left, they get something to eat and replenish all those calories expended cussing out the machines.  On this trip, they bought me a large Fatburger.  Yum, I hadn't had a fat juicy, delicious, warm Fatburger in awhile.  What a treat.

There was a little more mayo than I like, and the lettuce and tomato along with the onions and relish made for messy eating.  But the best part was the seared, fresh juicy hamburger patty. The bun was fresh and didn't fall apart. Overall this burger can hold its own against any burger joint in this town."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger places while in Vegas. Living in NYC I can't get this burger on east coast. Being on the strip makes for a nice walk and then stop in for a great burger along the way. I will be in Vegas in two weeks and plan on enjoying a nice \"Fatburger\" during my stay..."}
{"text":"Upon ordering our food, another patron was horrified at paying for a regular fat burger and getting a burger the same size as the baby fat she also ordered. The cashier agreed they were the same size and the cook disagreed. It turned into a yelling match between patron and cook. Wow what a horrific sight to see. The cook walked out to get security and the patron yelled for a manager (who never came).   The cashier tried to help the patron and ended up just refunding the money. The poor guy seemed so flustered and the cook was so angry and dismissing at the same time.  Needless to say, we were in the middle of our order when this fiasco took place , so the cashier was distracted trying to accommodate the upset patron. After refunding her money, he came back to us.  Finally after we get our order in...it was a pretty big one (to go). We waited until our food was ready and left to go home. I got home, took 2 bites of my large fat burger with grilled onions and the meat inside was pink. Undercooked to the edge of the patty. I almost threw up. I barely ate my burger. 2 bites. What a waste. I called the store several times. ..no answer.   So I came here, online, to the feedback section. And now since I wasted my money and have no burger to watch while I Netflix...I guess I have to settle for top ramen tonight. :(



I used to really enjoy Fatburger, but lately it doesn't taste the way I remember. Totally bland and badly prepared/cooked."}
{"text":"Was a typical burger fast food joint. Wasnt too impressed however it was early morning and it is located on the strip in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"My burger was still RAW from the inside after I ordered a second burger because they messed up my first order. I said NO onions, pickles, and cheese and they put all that and I complained and said they would make it again and guess what! I got the same exact burger and raw meat because they rushed it. Horrible service horrible everything they shouldn't even be in red rock."}
{"text":"I was expecting the same experience that I normally get from Fat Burger in Los Angeles. The onion rings were the only item that was as good as the ones I have had previously. The burger just wasn't the same. Gritty texture and under seasoned. The worst part was the bun which was stale. Kudos to the wait staff who were extra friendly. I would have complained but my order was to go and I was too far away to drive back when I discovered the substandard food."}
{"text":"There is just something about being able to get a nice greasy burger and sit down between 3 prostitutes and their pimp on one side of you, and a family of 4 on the other side, and have everyone just so happy with their burger that they don't care about what else is going on. This is Fatburger! 

If you like burgers, stop in and get you some!"}
{"text":"On a 4 night trip to Red Rocks ate here twice!  Medium Burger with cheese and all the fixings and still could not finish it. Exceptional burger- freshly made. When you order they give you a number on a stick and bring out your order.  Cheese fries were tasty. Free refills on soda.  Come hungry- these burgers are ' fat'!  A little pricey but worth every penny!  A quick and fast meal between gambling, bingo sessions or before or after a movie.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service, usually things are slow here but today was ridiculous.  I walked in, and the line was moving so slowly that I just left.  My friends who stayed told me that it took forever for them to get their food.  I don't understand how this place stays in business.   Do not come here if you value your time."}
{"text":"I've had the worst experience here. Feeling sick since I ate there. We waited quite awhile for our food (that's normal) and received our cold food. I ate the hamburger- I probably shouldn't ... and probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Ugh . But thank you for giving me some of my money back-appreciate it . Next time I'll just eat at home before the movie."}
{"text":"This place was actually pretty good. Although, I wish they had a condiment bar instead of just stuffing my burger with everything possible. Definitely better than any fast food places like McDonalds or Jack in the Box. But definitely nothing compared to mom and pop burger joints you can find around San Francisco. 

Fast and Friendly service. No complaints here. 

The place can be a little cleaner, but hey all places could usually be a little cleaner. 

Overall: I had a good experience here. Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE IF AN OLD INDIAN/MAYBE LATINA WOMAN IS WORKING THE CONDIMENTS!!!! 
I was making my second trip here during my Vegas vacation on a slow, Sunday afternoon. When I got my order it was wrong. No big deal, just needed a bun swap (I HATE MAYO!!!) and different condiments. I brought the burger back and asked to get a new top bun. THE LADY PROCEEDED TO WIPE OFF THE TOP OF THE BUN WITH A WET, DIRTY, RAG, AND WAS READY TO GIVE IT BACK TO ME! Who does that???  
When I confronted the lady and her manager, she flat out denied what I just saw in front of my face. On top of that she denied taking our receipt too! What a shame! On top of all of this, the f*%$ head manger gave me tons of attitude after I demanded a refund. I had so much love for this place before, but what did I ever expect from a fast food place on the Strip? Good luck eating here. I hope to revive my love affair for the Fatburger establishment one day, but not on Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"I walk in, cashier girl who we will cal Betty because she has a Betty boop tattoo on her thigh, ignores me because she's busy flirting. Immediately annoyed but whatever, teens will be teens yea?
Go to sit after ordering my food, every table is dirty.
That is not a hyperbole, every table is too dirty for me to even feel comfortable eating at.
In addition, there are these napkins with little \"I am the plug\" drawings on every table. Perhaps it's my hatred for Drake, but I pointed them out to my server when he brought the food. He cleaned some up. Another dude, whom I though was a customer, walks into the back to do whatever. 
In case you were wondering how I know this girl had a thigh tattoo, easy, her and this boy were in normal clothing but walking in and out of the kitchen like it was their playground. It's awkward to order food from someone when you were convinced they worked there. In addition, Billy is the only dude actually working and kudos to him for dealing with those other two completely disregarding their duties.
I get it, they are teens. But just because you employee teenagers doesn't mean your restaurant needs to be ran like an unproductive teen club meeting.
Do something, train your people or hire people who appreciate work."}
{"text":"Conveniently located on the strip, Fat Burger makes for a convenient hangover cure. I have absolutely zero complaints about this place. For someone who just recently started eating burgers again I have no regrets. I thought this place was so good that I came here twice and wanted to go again before my flight home but overslept lol. It was one of the best burgers I've had honestly. The burger was seasoned to perfection and with all the toppings it was a mess of flavorful and deliciousness."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER! This was our first time trying here, we went through the drive thru. The man was rushing us and for no reason it took them 20 minutes to give us our two meals. I don't care if you work fast food or you're a CEO of a company professionalism is EVERYTHING. And the man who we dealt with was not!! If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Yelp says they're open 24/7, and their sign & website says they're open until 4 am - but the guy working had the audacity to say they were closed and act like he was doing me a favor by firing up the grill at 3 am. Likely story, dude. Quit graveyard if you're too tired or lazy to do it. This was literally one of the only places open at 3 am that wasn't a bar and I'm not 21 so SORRY I'M HUNGRY DUDE. I'm sure fat burger wouldn't appreciate this guy acting like they're closed when they aren't. He had the lights turned off and was in the back hiding, an hour before they were supposed to close. He said they closed 45 mins ago, and I said they needed to update their hours in that case. Will not waste my time during late hours again."}
{"text":"I'm being generous with two stars that's just because they are opened late. When we got here it was packed! I ordered the XXl Burger and I asked the lady what's the best fries because they have different choices she told me the chili cheese fries. I asked her let me get those without chili and just make them cheese fries.. When I saw those fries after I ordered them I was very disappointed it was like they took American cheese and put it on top and let it melt. I was very confused on how you mess up cheese fries it's very easy. Anyways the burger was big but tasted like nothing if that makes any sense. The bun was like dry and not soft it was gross I needed a lot of coke to wash it down with. After I eat it my stomach wasn't happy for a while. This place is over priced and gross. I'd rather find another burger place that actually cares about your food."}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS IN TOWN !!! The customer service is great!  I ordered a large fat burger and I always go there once in a while and the cashier always happens to be rosie and let me tell you she is the best, makes my day and always helps me out with anything ! Today I went in around 4 pm and they were kinda busy but they still manage to keep up with my order there was 2 other guys there and they know how to make their customers happy!!!"}
{"text":"It's just a burger(I had turkey)...made to order, which is a little different for fast-food. 

Either than that I see no difference from Nations, Mickey D's, Burger King etc.

Yea I'll suggest it, but it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"This is for the Sunset Station location - Don't know what all the hype is about....but the burgers are just OK. This location has really bad customer service! I purposely sat at a table with a power outlet because I has to finish up some work on my laptop. So while waiting for my order, I took out my laptop and plugged it...The manager came by and said I couldn't use their outlet!!! Also, there were two guys sitting next to my table who were waiting for their friends to arrive, and the manager told them they can't sit there unless they order something!! RUDE!! Fatburger, how are you going to pay for overhead if you kick out your customers?!?! TWO THUMBS DOWN!"}
{"text":"First time eating at any Fatburger. This place is great! I had a delicious turkey burger, which exceeded my expectations. The food is made to order, so you do have to wait. But you know the food has not been quietly growing stale and dry in an aluminum bin like in fast food restaurants. The cook actually brought the order out to the table, which was unexpected! My only criticism is that the restaurant did not have good air circulation and had a stuffy feeling."}
{"text":"A recent transplant from San Francisco, also latin and never been to one of these, took a chance on this place because I didn't want to deal w/ the in & out burger crowds. MMMM Good. Bigger, fresher burgers, fresh vegetables, quality meat. The two gentlemen there (one the cook, the other at the cash register) were both hard at work and very friendly.  I will definately return, in fact, my husband is on his way there b/c I have a craving for their non-greasy, saltless killer steak fries. Go figure. Forget the in & out. this is definately the place for cheap and good food."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with their Boca burger.  It's not every fast food hamburger joint that has a veggieburger.  I was really glad it was well done because I ordered everything on the burger.  It seemed like this place was always open; people were constantly lined up to try the Fatburger."}
{"text":"This is the Fatburger location inside the Green Valley Ranch casino. It serves up all the usual Fatburger offerings. And it's open extra late. So when leaving the casino after a late night of drinking, you can grab some delicious Fatburger to go. The staff were polite and efficient. Everything was quick and correct about our order. And the burgers are seriously delicious! The Baby Fat is just the right size for me. And their chili cheese fries are pretty darn tasty too. So in sum, this is the place to get a burger when at GVR."}
{"text":"Okay, I was impressed by Fatburger. I think they have a better burger than In-N-Out. I love the size options and the fact that they have a good veggie burger, and that you can add a fried egg to your burger. The fries were not that great; I wish I'd tried the tasty-looking onion rings. This is a nasty place with dirty bathrooms, but sometimes I like that in a burger joint! Like Dirty's in Austin. It's just part of the ambiance."}
{"text":"Awful.  Place smells like garbage and the service is poor.  I could get over the garbage smell since I didn't eat there, but the burger just was just not very good.  Place was empty and the employees seemed annoyed that I came and they actually had to do their jobs. 

Fat burger used to be a place to grab an above average burger in my opinion, but this location defiantly is not."}
{"text":"I found this place surprisingly good. The only other time I had eaten at a Fatburger my experience wasn't great, so I didn't know what to expect when I bought a meal here before a movie at Red Rock. The burger was very tasty and filling, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The burgers here were really good.  Grilled and with crisp edges.  I would most certainly eat here again.  The place is a little rough around the edges but a good place for a burger and fries and to avoid the expensive places in the hotels."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!! Waited near the order box in the drive through for a while before they finally acknowledged me. They still had me wait even longer though. I assumed he was the only guy working and had to take orders, payments, AND make the food, until I saw someone else there cooking. When he took my order, he didn't ask the usual questions such as fat or skinny fries, what I wanted on my burger, or what drink I wanted. I went ahead and gave him all that info anyway just in case he wasn't a mind reader. I got to the window and he just stood there. Didn't ask me for payment or anything. Now I'm thinking I must be the mind reader, because I handed him my card and sure enough he did want me to pay for my food! He handed my card back, again without saying anything. I waited maybe 15mins before I got my food. I know fatburger takes a long time, so the wait isn't a big deal. He asked me what I wanted to drink even though I told him already. He gives me my drink while I wait for the food. Once he gives me my food, I open it to make sure it is correct. No cheese! I paid 99¢ for cheese, I'm going to get my cheese! I honk to get their attention and hand him back the bag and told him I ordered with cheese. He takes it and comes back a short time later. I start to open it to check again while asking \"what, did you just throw a slice on the one I have you?\" And sure enough, that is what they did! Cold cheese on my burger! I told him to go ahead and take the whole order back and I would like my money back. I paid with my card and they gave me cash back. I guess go here if you just need some cash but all you have is your card. Otherwise, just go elsewhere. I came to In N Out right after and the guy who took my order was so great I wanted to hug him."}
{"text":"Since I hadn't been to Fatburger in a while, I decided to stop in to get a burger and fries. I pulled up to the menu board in the drive through - which was barely visible because most of the lights were burned out. An employee came on the speaker and said that she would \"be with me in a minute\". I waited. And waited. And waited. After ten minutes with no response, I left. As I pulled around the restaurant I saw one car at the pickup window and three people sitting in the dining area, so they weren't exactly overrun with business. I know why."}
{"text":"I discovered I love Fatburger more than In-N-Out. It's so good. I can't believe there is a Fatburger in the Bay Area and JC and it took me a visit to LV to finally try it out. I was missing out big time.

I ordered a turkey cheeseburger because I'm not a fan of red meat. But if no one told me it was turkey, I'd swear I was eating ground beef. It was super juicy and the burger had all the grease residuals from the stove. I got mine sans mustard, pickles, and relish because those are not my friends. Still with all the other toppings (lettuce, tomato, mayo, raw onions) my burger was pretty tall. It also came in a toasted wheat bun. Did I mention, the burger was as big as my face?

Fatburger also offers skinny fries and fat fries. You can get them with cheese or chili cheese. Everything on the menu looks super good but the burger was enough to fill me up. In regards to the price (not cheap), Fatburger is also better than Bistro Burger."}
{"text":"This, was probably my favorite burguer place... only at the Beverly Hills - LA. 
At the store in Las Vegas, was a poor experience. I bought a XXXL Burguer, with 3x 1/2 pound patties, only the burguer... no soda, no fries... and they charged full meal. When I received, the meat was well done, I asked for medium rare, with egg, everything was burned. At the cook place, a lot of people making jokes with each other's. 
I feels disrespected as a customer.
My order was $40 bucks and I think, I should eat better at McDonalds."}
{"text":"If you like frozen burgers from your grocer then this is the place for you. If your starving and you come across this place then your good to go. If your hungry and your planning a burger place to go to then choose one other then this place."}
{"text":"Seriously, with all of the amazing burger places in Vegas, why in the world would you go here? 

I took my son the burger lover to this place and wow, was he disappointed. I thought he could eat anything. I guess I was wrong. That makes two of us that didn't like it here.

First, the wait is atrocious. They say the burgers take 6-8 minutes to make. Okay, why did I wait over 15 minutes for mine in a place with zero customers but me and my son? Oh, that's right, because charred-to-hell burgers take longer; gotta make sure they're dead. They definitely handed me a dead burger.

My son asked for everything on his burger but tomato and onions. They ignored us and went ahead and put them on anyway. Thanks, now we had the added pleasure of picking things off that we didn't order. I also ordered a Diet Coke which they promptly forgot about. How hard is it to get a lone customer's order right? Pretty hard, apparently.

The burgers were so burnt and so tasteless, if the grease hadn't been dripping off we would have though we were chewing on blackened wood. I'm sure there's a place for that somewhere in Vegas, I just wasn't looking for it.

When my son ate his french fries I asked him what he thought. Being the straightforward kid he is, he promptly said 'they taste like Burger King fries.' I'm not a fan of Burger King fries, but I wanted to be able to say I tasted them. That would be a stretch to say that. I didn't taste anything. These skinny fries have to be the worst in the world. I think I'd rather eat BK's. Ugh.

The service sucks, the food sucks, just stay away."}
{"text":"I typically go to GVR for the movie theater and sometimes I swing by this Fatburger for a quick bite.  Admittedly, I was craving for a Fatburger since the last time I went to GVR early one morning only to find it CLOSED.  Yep - this Fatburger is not open 24/7 as advertised.

Unfortunately, it seems that the quality of the burgers cooked here vary from day to day.  Sometimes the burgers are juicy and flavorful and sometimes they are dry and bland.  

If only the burgers were more consistently yummy."}
{"text":"DON\"T buy the $29.99 slushie package for two groupon. You will be wasting your money, instead go to 7-eleven and buy a couple of slurpies. There is no alcohol in these drinks. I read the reviews before I bought and didn't listen...I do regret. I even added extra vodka to mine and I never got a buzz. The place itself is in a great location and the servers were very friendly. Don't waste your time on a groupon."}
{"text":"What I want to know is who the hell puts sweet relish on a burger? Especially a burger that already has dill pickles.. I mean I love pickles as much as the next asshole, but I fn HATE sweet relish, so it pretty much ruined the whole thing. 

Aside from that, my curly fries were perfect, and they have Cherry Coke.. so here, have 2 stars."}
{"text":"The burgers were nasty!  It tasted like they got the patties at a discount from Walmart off the frozen section.

I have had Fatburger and I know they're good but not from this location, I threw half the burger in the garbage. I was with my brother and he looked like he was about to throw up."}
{"text":"The food and milkshake was good, but the manager was who really made the experience. He was cooking as well as making sure to talk to everyone that came in, and hand delivering each order with a smile. He really went out of his way to make sure everything was great which is rare in fast food chains. 

I just randomly stopped here as I live in another part of town, but I'm glad I did, and I'll make the drive to come back"}
{"text":"Fatburger's been around Vegas for a while and had a reputation as the best burger in town for years. Recently they've been outclassed by SmashBurger and I can say there's not much reason to go back. The burgers are average and served with relish and lots of mayo which makes for an odd sweet taste. Fries taste about the same as those from the frozen section of the grocery store and are rather limp. 

This location had particularly bad service. Went in around 8 pm on a weeknight and there was only one staff member behind the counter, trying to fix a broken milkshake machine. Took about five minutes for other staff members to show up and even then they hung around the kitchen area. We had to wait for the first staff member to finish making milkshakes to help us and then he was incredibly unfriendly. On top of that there's no drive-thru.

If you're looking for a good burger in Vegas go to SmashBurger, or at the least In-N-Out. Avoid Fatburger."}
{"text":"This is the slowest fatburger ever! I order a shake it takes them 20 mins to make? Cmon! Really!"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of weeks ago.  I had the Med burger meal with skinny fries and the works minus cheese on my burger.

Awesome hamburger!  Awesome Lemonade!  Good service and clean tables& floors. A tad pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Isn't everything suppose to taste better when you are faded?  Burgers here taste like cardboard.  I can't imagine how bad it tastes when I'm sober.  Their diet coke tastes pretty good though.

The location is right on the strip so its very convenient.  It's not that fast of a fast food place so expect to wait about 5 to 10 minutes... especially when there is a line."}
{"text":"This was my very first Fatburger visit and I must say I was very impressed.

I found Fatburger while looking for a quick place to grab some supper before a meeting.  My meal was a regular burger with cheese and a lemonade. Nothing too fancy but certainly one of the tastiest and least greasy hamburgers I've had in a while.

Looking forward to seeing more locations closer to where I live and normally hang out."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, homemade onion rings, make sure to stop at the sports bar for amazing Alaskan beer on draft!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!  No onion rings 20 minutes prior to closing!  This is not acceptable!  Fire the management!"}
{"text":"A burger is a a burger is a burger is a burger. Two meals = $30 and the fries were cold.

No thanks.
Fat price!"}
{"text":"Mediocre burgers - if you are in the area and want a fast food burger, Fatburger is  a better bet than Wendy's. But it is nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"It is great that it is open 24hours but the food was not that great. I have been to better fatburgers in other states. The served taking my order clearly hated her job and was a bit rude.  The visit was at 4am but it was quite crowded.
Next time I would just go to the McDonald's next door because of the pricing.  My beef just did not compare with a sit down resteraunts typical hamburger and was a step down from in n out."}
{"text":"Waited at our table for 20 minutes, no service, said excuse me to one waitress and she ignored me. 3 groups that showed up after us got immediate service. Absolutely atrocious."}
{"text":"Wow. We opted to go to Fatburger on a Monday night INSTEAD of going to a strip club. This has to say something about the draw of their 'cuisine' here. Perhaps it's sprinkled with a ghetto-fabulous dust that has the same addictive qualities as coke (I believe this dust is sodium and lard-based).

For the two of us, we ordered about 60 dollars worth of food. The food isn't good, but if you feel the craving of a pregnant lady itching inside you for fried and greasy food that will probably dissipate the moment holy water ever touched it, this is your place. 

We went around 3am and it was still open, so yay for the hours.

I got some oreo shake concoction, and it was so thick that when I turned my cup upside-down, the shake was still in place; not one drop leaked out of the cup.

We ordered the chicken burger, 2 other burgers with assorted toppings, hotdog, chili fries, onion rings, beer (from outside), and the shake. After all, we had a checklist for things to do while in Vegas, and our list was basically a list of the 7 sins. Gluttony, check.

It was all very wrong, but felt so right."}
{"text":"Burgers was okay, fries done right and well, but the service I got when ordering was just not good.
And since it's really out of my area, I don't think I will try this place again."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, onions rings and fat tire draft beer!  10% local discount and free fries with beer!"}
{"text":"This location is not the best in the LV valley, but the burgers are juicy and made to order. My only complaint is that it is bit over price. Not sure I would ever order the XXXL burger. It might be too much burger if that is even possible."}
{"text":"I've been to other Fat Burger locations and i love it.  BUT this location is horrible.  Food is disgusting and my friend got sick off the chicken sandwich.  BEWARE.  i suggest just going next door to MCD and getting the $1 spicy chicken."}
{"text":"We were at Texas Station recently and went to eat here after about a minute after we ordered I got a call and we had to leave.  We asked for acredit back to our card and these two kids said they didn't know how to do a credit?seriously they are frying burgers and ringing up orders but they want us to believe they don't know how!  I've worked in places with registers and you are trained how to handle these matters. The little girl was smug and disrespectful grinning saying you'll  have to come back tomorrow when the manager is here. I said I work tomorrow but again she just grinned and said sorry you'll have to come back tomorrow cause we don't know how to do our job!  they can't do Credit!  I wonder if I starting eating and the burger was awful she is going to say I can't do acredit so you will have to come back..not hardly! So I come back \"tomorrow\" and this little burger flipper says I told you to call first the manager is only here at 7...we can't help you and she called me a liar.  She is the liar because my husband was with me when she said to come back tomorrow.  I waited about h15 mins because they were so busy ..watching here maul the burgers and picking at the meat in the center to see if it was done...so I have been defrauded so I will contact my bank.  She smugly said we are a franchise...but franchisees cannot defraud their customers.  Beware if this place.  I hope you are truly not so stupid you can operate your cash register. She has a long way to go to learn how to treat customers.  Long story shorter...we kept coming back and kept getting lied to...finally Saturday we came back to get the food we already paid for and they refused to fix it until they talked to mgr who is never there...we refused to leave and after much arguing they agreed to fix the food we paid for on Wednesday...then the burger flipper Emily told security she was afraid of me cause I told her to go to hell which I absolutely did after her telling me I was a liar...she is the liar, my husband was present when she told us to come back on Thursday...we were customers if this place...she has no people skills at all so she should just keep flipping burgers and stay away with any interaction with customers.  We are guest here for a week and I will take the security guards suggestion and speak to the casino management about this restaurant employees."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints if you want the best burger on the strip! The crunchiness is absolutely amazing! Be sure to add chili and cheese! We never hit Vegas without doing a FatBurger Run! Be sure to get the skinny fries and the Vegas Vacation drink!! Top notch cheap meal!"}
{"text":"Another day, another burger! A pretty nice place to get a fast food burger if you're in the area! Provides you with a nice burger with all the bells and whistles, so to speak!

Came by for the Yelp Burger Binge Week, and was pretty happy with the burger. Quick and friendly staff took my order and made the burger in about 5 min. If you sit in, they will even bring you your meal to the table! 

A nice juicy burger with all the toppings you'd typically expect! Except this one included cheese and bacon, which are the best toppings in my opinion! If you want, there are options you can include on top or exclude if you are so inclined to do so! Easy personalization without much hassle and lineup. 

If you're looking for a fast food burger that's better than your typical joint, I'd give this chain a try!"}
{"text":"Who's in charge here? Poor customer service over the phone. If you're busy say so. If you can't take an order over the phone, say so. Don't just hung up on people then not answer the phone. Way to lose clients."}
{"text":"I'm a total fan of Fatburger. IMHO, it is a superior burger to In-n-Out. Yeah, I said that. And their chilli cheese fries are pretty great too.

This location is on the Strip, near the Hawaiian Marketplace. You'll pretty need to park elsewhere and walk here. There's an inside area and an outside area. Since people-watching on the Strip is a fav pastime of my mine, we opted for outside.

The outside space is a circular bar with bar seating and then several high-tops. It's a seat yourself place. Unlike other Fatburger locations, this one has waitresses. So when you sit outside, a server will come and take your order, bring you your food, and bring you a check.

Also unlike other Fatburger locations, since this one has a bar, you can get beer and mixed drinks. There's also a slushie stand where you can purchase those crazy yard-long tourist concoctions.

The service isn't much, but that's kinda to be expected.

The food, though, is awesome. I thoroughly devoured my delicious burger and all the chilli cheese fries. If you're looking for a good, cheap-ish burger, and want to partake in some excellent people-watching, this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"I find this place a little expensive. . I wasn't really a big fan of this place. Food to me was just ok, nothing special. There is 3 different burger sizes and I don't think the medium burger size example was true in size. My burger was way bigger. I would get the small next time."}

{"text":"Rude employees, place is dirty, food was alright, not the same as back then.

Went around 7ish to get a burger, when I went to order the guy sounded mad and annoyed, if you don't like your job go find an other job. Guy was rude when I was ordering, would cut me off and literally tossed my food and jerked it my way through the drive thru window."}
{"text":"Ahh Fatburger, how do I love thee?? Lucky for me, I was born on the west coast and have always had access to In--out and Fatburger. The raging debate goes on as to which is better. Well duh, they are different!! They both have fantastic things to offer. Fatburger is fantastic, because a. they cook your food when you order it, b. you can get a fried egg on top of your burger, and c. you can fax in your order. Fatburger tastes so great and you get your choice of skinny fries, fat fries, or onion rings. Also, you can get a turkey burger which is so good!! I crave Fatburger once in a while and I absolutely cannot satisfy the craving otherwise."}
{"text":"The food wasn't to bad. Fresh grilled burgers and the bomb drinks! On the south end of the strip,  good location."}
{"text":"I watched as a truck sat in the drive thru for 10 minuets if not more without being helped at all. It's not like you couldn't hear the vehicle sitting out there either, it was a diesel. As soon as the car pulled up that was behind them they were helped right away, to just to sit at the window for another 10 minuets waiting on their food."}
{"text":"Was it the best ever? Maybe not but we were hungry and everything was extremely hot and fresh. I could barely finish my burger. It was also nice to eat outside near the fountain at night and bring our dog out. So will definitely be back. Not too often though. It is fast food! They lost one star for service mainly because of lack of English knowledge by counter person. Not friendly either."}
{"text":"We were tired and walking around aimlessly after one of our tours and stopped in for burgers. They are pretty good and not overly expensive."}
{"text":"Since there's no Fatburger around from where I live, it was definitely one of the places I have to eat while I'm in Vegas. It was kinda hidden from the strip, but it's directly across from Monte Carlo and located in a small plaza next to Walgreens that was being renovated. To promote the new FOX TV show's Bob's burger, we were a bit confused at first thinking Fatburger is now Bob's burger, but it's only temporary. This is a good place if you want to grab a burger something quick besides McDonald's. It's a bit pricier than other fast food chains, but it was just fattening good. The burgers can get larger and larger, but the average size of their burger would be a medium since a small would like a tiny burger."}
{"text":"I went to the Fat Burger location off of Rancho and Craig Road in Las Vegas, Nevada at about 8:05p.m. -8:22p.m. This is not the first time I've been to this location, and this is not the first time I have had horrible service here. This was by far the worst of all the instances, though. I went through the drive-thru and a lady, Marisol (name on receipt), on the speaker asked if she could take my order. I had but a second to think when she rudely and quickly said, \"Just let me know when you're ready to order.\" I said that I was ready to order & she did not respond. I said \"hello, can you hear me?\" Still no response. She finally came back on and said \"let me know when you're you ready to order\" I said yes, I have been  ready and started to place my order.  She cut-off me off and told me to hold numerous times while putting in my order. I get up to the window and ask if there was something wrong with the head set because it seemed like any time I started to talk I would get cut off. This lady immediately started to get aggressive with me and tell me, \"Well I told you to let me know when you're ready. I'm too busy here for you to decide what you want.\" (Now mind you, as I drive up to the establishment I noticed that there was hardly anyone inside as I pulled up to the drive thru & only 2 cars ahead of me -One car was at the window& the other was waiting behind him to get his food. There was no one behind me). I asked her if there something was wrong with the headset because I tried numerous tine to get her attention at the intercom. She became very unpleasant,  hostile, & very unprofessional. She  said she was too busy. After arguing with her and telling her she was cutting me off even when I tried to order and her denying this I finally just paid and waited for my food. When I asked for a manager she claimed she was a manager. This surprised me because I cannot believe anybody in their right mind would allow this awful woman to be a manager of anything. She is absolutely horrible with people (again, this isn't my first time dealing with this lady). I asked for her name and her manager's number. She said her name was on the receipt. She would not provide me with a ph# to her manager.  This whole situation appalled me. I am baffled! Her behavior and customer service is unacceptable! Shame on the owner and shame on Fat Burger for keeping someone like that around!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a rip off. I recently went here during my visit to Vegas. If you want to pay an outrageous price for a \"Fatburger\" then this is the place for you. I walked out of there with a bill of $50 for 3 cheeseburgers and a greasy hot dog. The lady at the register had an attitude and i think that those prices should provide better customer service. Will never go there again. It truly is nothing special and definitely NOT worth the price!"}
{"text":"Dirty tables and floors. Cashier had no clue what she was doing. Dumb basically and tried to overcharge me $2 for a salad. No water cups at the cashier counter so she said she couldn't give me a cut for water. Her boss had to tell her to go in the back and get some. Had no clue about military discount either. The manager was very accomodating. Boy does she have her work cut out for her!"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service!!! The employees are not nice and the food took forever. We placed an order at 3:03 PM.  We didn't get the order until 20 to 25 minutes later.  The order was wrong but we ate it anyway because we didn't want to wait an additional 20 minutes.  They didn't even get the drinks right.  I'm not sure how 'Mountain Dew' sounds anything like 'Root Beer'.  We also requested no tomatoes. Guess what?  We received tomatoes.  The employees really do act as though they don't give a crap.  
I will never eat at Fatburger again.  This was my first and ultimately LAST time."}
{"text":"First time betting Fatburger. The pictures looked so good. I order a grilled chicken sandwich with the chicken on the side (to ensure my sandwich didn't become soggy). However when I arrived home I saw that my sandwich was completely plain. Just chicken and bread. Cannot believe I paid $7.50 for this. I'm especially frustrated about this because I'm 7 months pregnant and I was craving the good in the picture. One good thing, the fries were very good."}
{"text":"Order from Grub hub - picked up at 7:37pm..arrived a FULL 30 minutes later cold.

Burgers are good...service and delivery is a joke."}
{"text":"This place is run by imbeciles. 

Ordered a LARGE fatburger - the cook ANGEL proceeds to plunk the think ball of meat on the grill and wander off for 2 minutes!

Then flips it and still leaves in without flattening it to cook properly

THEN FLATTENS IT LIKE A DAMN PANCAKE so it 8\" wide !

So I'm watching him and knowing when he attempts to flip again - it will disintegrate - which is DOES...so this idiot proceeds to take the THIRD of the burger I just paid for and throw it down the waste hole on the grill!!  All while I'm watching this!  So I says \" Hey - you just threw away a 1/3 of my burger - I watched you! and he just looks at me spaced out like  - I tell the kid on cash who is like - \"I don't know!\"  

How many times are they doing this to customers who are not watching??  I paid for a large and got less than a med burger - all because the grill guy is not paying ATTN and flattens the burger TOO DAMN MUCH!! 

I am relating this to head office and district supervisor as no one at THIS location gives a damn obviously - look at the pathetic score on this store and non reply for MGMT.....of course...IF there is any at all...."}
{"text":"Fatburger is all hype. They're just overpriced burgers. I'm not saying it's not good, but it's nothing special. Cheese does not automatically come on the burgers, you have to pay an extra dollar for it. There are other add ons you can get for an extra charge as well. It also comes a la carte so sides are separate. Two burgers (one large and one medium) and a side of fries came out to almost 30 dollars."}
{"text":"One of my first stops every time I'm in Vegas.   It's one of my favorite burgers anywhere and the chain hasn't made it to my corner of the world yet.   Since my last visit - they have expanded to add the \"Fat Bar\" - which provides the same great food in a patio bar out front of the restaurant.  The only thing better than a Fat Burger is washing it down with a nice beer.   After a little taste testing - I've decided I like the skinny fries better than the fat (wedge) fries.  See you next time Fatburger!"}
{"text":"I had their veggie burger. It was about $6 and I added cheese for $1. It was similar to Burger King's BK Veggie burger and about twice the size so I was OK with it being twice the price. Fat fries (AKA steak fries) were standard and I'm a fan of them so I liked them. My mom got a chocolate shake and that was pretty good too. 

All and all I would say it lived up to it's reputation to me and the others I ate with who had regular burgers. There is limited seating so if they are really busy and you are planning to eat there you might have a problem finding a place to sit if you are in a group."}
{"text":"I  will never visit this location again. The sweaty big guy,that took my order was rude. As I pulled up he opens the window to retrieve my money. As I roll my window down to hand him my card,he turns his head and starts taking another order. So,after sitting there for a good 7 minutes, he hands me my root beer float with sweat mixed with root beer, on the outside of the cup...Yuck! The burger was supposed to be a Xl...It looked more like a regular burger from a ran down whole in the wall,ass place. Even most of them have larger burgers than this....Then after he hands me my food,I asked for ketchup, he says, it's in there, as he proceeds to shut the window as I was still talking. ..$15.89...I don't think so. ...waisted money. When I got home I took three bites. No flavor, bread was hard on the top,and the bottom bun was soggy. I ended up giving the rest to my dog.."}
{"text":"Hell to the no. This location sucks, and if you don't know, now you know. I waited over 20 minutes for a nasty overpriced chicken sandwich. I know they make everything fresh, but I was the only person there. I have eaten burgers from here before, and they were okay, but I thought I would try something different and go with a chicken sandwich. It was supposed to be a grilled teriyaki chicken, but it was teri-yucky haha. Super salty and not worth the price. I also ordered chili cheese fries, and was given regular fries. Luckily they didn't charge me for the chili fries so I didn't say anything. I don't mind waiting and paying for good food, but this was not good."}
{"text":"Finally got my son to try Fatburger with me and he loved it. We both got bacon cheeseburgers, he got his with a fried egg that's kind of his thing. This one's not in the best side of town but if you're over here it's clean and the food is very well prepared. We also recommend the fat fries they're really good steak fry style fries. Not the cheapest place to get a burger, but much better than most places you should definitely try it out at any location in town."}
{"text":"1st time eating here & must say that the staff is very professional, kind and courteous!!! The burgers were delicious along with the chilly cheese fries!!!! Nicole our waitress was very attentive and Francisco who runs the food was awesome making sure the orders were correct!!! Strongly recommend this world famous burger joint!!!!!"}
{"text":"I got talked into the impossible burger, which was supposed to be the latest and greatest \"veggie burger.\" It was dry and served on a dry bun that was too big for the \"meat.\" To make matters worse, I was told it was healthier, all natural, and plant based. Out of curiosity, I looked it up afterward, to find that it is a processed food loaded with preservatives and has more sodium and saturated fat than a beef burger, not to mention that it is GENETICALLY MODIFIED AND INCLUDES AN INGREDIENT THAT HAS BEEN DEEMED UNSAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION by the FDA. I can't believe I ate this!! I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE SELLING THIS!! The impossible burger is well named... it proves it is impossible to make a fake burger that's better than a real one. PLEASE STOP SERVING THIS!!"}
{"text":"I just expected more. Idk. it was expensive and the burger was just ok. Fries were also just ok. I will have to give it another shot but was not overly impressed especially not with the price."}
{"text":"My Uber driver recommended Fat Burger. Walking inside smelled like moldy beach water or old mop water. There was a horrible smell coming from the back are. It made the whole joint stink. I couldn't even smell the food being freshly prepared. 

I ordered the turkey burger and mom ordered the chicken sandwich. We split a side of onion rings. Simple! 

The turkey burger was seasoned and cooked really well. Very juicy.
The chicken sandwich was good according to mom. However, after being told there was an extra charge for cheese, mom asked for NO cheese on her sandwich. she was charged for it anyway, and it was added. 
The onion rings were fried crispy but juicy! 

Would I visit again? Yes for the food, but only if I knew the smell wouldn't be a problem in the future."}

What type of service is this???"}

Also, the whole place smells like ass."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try a Fatburger ever since Ice Cube told me that he ate one at two in the morning.

Well I had my eyes did at Lasik Plus about 2 years ago which is right next to the fatburger, so after my initial consult we moseyed on over to try it out.  The burgers were aight, Thanks alot O'shea! Foo, I'm just trickin'! No, but seriously they were good, and where else can you add an egg to your burger?.  The relish was a bit strong, so I recommend that you get it on the side, or not at all.  Hey, it was clean, and the staff wasn't all loungin' around when I went. Maybe the boss was there!"}

It's not, but it's on the strip and open.

If you can make it In-n-Out do, otherwise, go here...."}

Overall I spent 45 DOLLARS for my entire family. 2 adults and 2 kids. NEVER AGAIN!"}

But really, everything tastes better outside, with a beer, and watching a game."}
{"text":"The Skinny: decent burger but it isn't something I would come again and again for (3.25), service: reasonable timing of food and it's counter service (3), value: it's not like In-and-Out kind of good deal but it's still pretty reasonable.

Went here for a bite after watching \"The Expendables\" and came for a large burger and the skinny fries.

Personally, I think that there is a little too much bun for the size of the patty. But otherwise, the bun had a nice texture and flavour. The patty itself was well-seasoned however lacked thickness and wasn't as juicy as it should be. The iceberg was shredded and was a little too wet. It kind of messed up the textures in the burger. The sauces on top were rather uninteresting.

The fries are nice - crispy and well salted.

Overall, a good burger but not exceptional."}

It was not the employee's fault at all, being short staffed with a long line at the drive through they were over loaded. Sadly the manager needs to step up and make sure he/she is fully staffed during the rush hours from 3pm to 8pm! Raishaundra and the cook were super nice and did a great job considering there were only 2 of them to fill the order's! Give those ladies a raise!!!"}
{"text":"I don't get the appeal of this chain.  What I had was just like any fast food burger but not as tasty."}
{"text":"The food was just okay. Over priced for the quality of food you get. The employees were great. Fat burger is only good for a late night meal"}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch with some friends, ordered the food to go.  Obviously they are in NO RUSH WHATSOEVER, even when you ask after 20 minutes where the food is.

There were maybe 2 or 3 orders ahead of us, and we all got basic burger combos.  We actually watched them make our hamburgers, and I'm pretty sure the cooks had never made one in their entire life -- or thought that if they stared at the patty long enough all of their problems would be answered.  THIS IS NOT GOURMET FOOD, THIS IS FAST FOOD.

Overall it took us half an hour from order to walking out the door.  No apologies even given.  Fries were done well before burgers, so they sat under a light IN FRONT OF US for most of the time.  Ridiculous.  Will NOT go back, and highly encourage the rest of you to NOT go."}
{"text":"This location is horrible. The staff are very very rude! If you have a special request such as something as simple as no pickles they still manage to screw it up. I recently visited the location on Sunset and Mountain Vista when I placed my order before I could finish the employee gave me my total. When I said I needed something else his reply was \"hold on since you want to order something else.\"Once he added the items he then said \"are you sure you don't want a drink? I mean really.\" This is the last time I will ever frequent this restaurant. The outside parking lot and menus are disgusting. The manager should be absolutely embarrassed as well as the company itself for such an awful representation of the Fatburger brand."}
{"text":"I just read Genevieve R's review below and have to say I didn't even know Fatburger had a vegetarian burger.

Who the hell goes to a place named \"Fatburger\" and eats veggies?  ;)

Me, I do the double meat (real meat, you know, beef), double cheese Fatburger. It's double the goodness. You can practically feel your arteries hardening with every drippy gooey delicious bite.

I don't know what it is about this place. But sometimes I just get this weird, \"I need a Fatburger NOW\" craving. And it doesn't stop until I gorge myself. Then I'm good for a couple of months.

It is a bit on the pricey side, but so far every visit has resulted in a tasty, juicy burger. Fries have ranged between so -so to really good. I have no idea why, but sometimes they just seem.... limp.

Killer shakes too!"}
{"text":"This location has not provided good service in the three years we have been patrons. We consistently wait 25 to 30 minutes for a couple burgers and fries, and our food is always delivered with an apology and agree order of something because they were out of an ingredient or forgot to drop our onion rings. Tonight was epic and the last time we will eat here. It took 45 minutes to get our food and when it arrived it was poorly wrapped and thrown in the bag. Both burgers were ice cold and the food was delivered with another apology and after order of chili fries, because our onion rings were not ready. I told the \"manager\" that our burgers were cold and she said she could reheat them for me. And indicated she is sorry everything is taking so long but she can't get her employees to work. She offered to remake the burgers, and said they were still running behind. I asked for a refund and that's the end of that. This location will never get it together. So if you are up for an adventure, and a good story to share at the end of the night, stop by this fat burger. Just don't come hungry."}
{"text":"Fatburger's the kinda place you come for lunch or a late night meal like when you leave the bars after 1a. I like the interior of the Fatburger on mill with its retroness and it's multilevel set-up. Altho climbing those stairs when drunk is not that fun. It's slightly pricier than other joints namely Five Guys and way more than In-N-Out. Usually a burger just comes with the regular fixings, lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles, but everything else is an add-on... like cheese, bacon, chili and egg. I do admit, I like that they have a fried egg as an option coz that's yum. I also like that they have other things apart from a burger, and that is a Turkeyburger and a Bocaburger.

I usually get a Small Fat and if I'm really hungry a Medium Fat. Their onion rings are pretty good, and their skinny fries are better than their fat fries imho. Anyways... if you're looking for a good burger and willing to pay a little extra, Fatburger is not that bad... it's alright and reliable especially on Mill Ave. =)"}
{"text":"In dying need of food after waiting in line for 3+ hours at a club that couldn't even get into, my stomach was starting to eat itself. Walking the strip and seeing fat burger was not busy ( 1am sat night ) decided to try this place out. Sitting outside in the patio area, watching drunk people pass by the waitress comes and asks \"any drinks?\" Umm yes just water for now, since I haven't looked at the menu yet.
(Please note, all employees that work here do not wear name tags...ODD)

Waitress comes back again and asks for my order, in which i tell her and brings me another water. Noticing others around me, there was a couple who arrived after me and got their food already. ( Already waiting 20 mins) So i figured my food should be arriving soon then. 40 mins later, food STILL hasn't shown up, now I'm furious. I flag down the waitress and ask her where the food is at and she leaves for another 5 mins, comes back and tells me something happened with my ticket order and the kitchen doesn't have it and she can't find it.....Really?? She then says \" Oh I must of thrown it away, what's your order again??\" uhh...So i asked for the manager on duty right away and told him what happened. He apologizes and gives me free drinks and a meal. Pshhh waiting an hour for a hamburger....ya no thanks...

Please avoid this place at all costs!"}

{"text":"You're money baby, money!

So my boy D and I were rolling through Vegas for the weekend.  Finally a chance to enjoy Sin City for a few days that weren't work related!  So maybe the boys from Swingers wouldn't have made a stop at Fatburger, but what the hell..we were saving our money for the fun stuff, so tried to keep the midday meals to a minimum.

What can I say?  I haven't had a Fatburger since I was a kid, and wasn't sure what to expect.  I am a confirmed In-N-Out lover, so wasn't sure if I was going to be traumatized by trying something else out, but went for it on D's advice.

Hamburgers were great, fries good and the atmosphere...interesting.  It was a midday meal, so not really full of what I understand to be the partying drunk crowd that it usually gets late night.  But the music was blaring and there were plenty of people eating, so much people watching was available.

I enjoyed my visit.  Wasn't the best burger in the world, but it was good.  Wasn't the most relaxing of locals but it was fun.  Wasn't the most healthy of meals (hellloo!  FAT-burger, right?) but it was tasty!

Enjoy it in all its glutony and have a good time.  It IS Sin City after all."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The staff was really really nice and friendly and the food was so yummy! We sat outside by the side walk and people watched as we ate our great burger and fat fries and drank a beer! Perfect place for lunch and a great price too!"}
{"text":"Abosulty never order from this store.  Manager was an asshole about giving my money back.  We ordered thru grub hub and got our food fast. But when it arrived it tasted old, flat soda, and the quality was horrible.  Called the manager back and he told me to complain to grubhub but we didn't have a issue with speed. But the quality was awful. The guy is spoke with had an attitude his name is Miguel Espinoza and basically told me to
Go fuck myself. Never go here never order from far burger here or anywhere."}
{"text":"Came here at 1 A.M. with my little brother, it's been a while since i'd been to a fat burger. I've been eating so much in n out i forgot what a fat burger taste like, so i got a large with everything in it including an egg! It was pretty darn good, the first thing i noticed about a fat burger thats different than a lot of the burgers that i've had is that a lot of the focus on flavor actually goes into the meat. Instead of everything that surrounds it. All in all a pretty good burger and a good A.M. snack!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I figure anyone could probably make this hamburger at home. Nothing really special about it. If all you like is a lot of meat on a burger this may be the place for you."}
{"text":"Staying at the Sunset Station, which by the way was much better than I had expected it to be.

Well Gus had some folks to meet for dinner and I was on my own. Figuring I would get something and take up to the room I walked around a couple of times and decided on Fatburger.

The young lady was quite personable with each who approached. She took my order of a burger with whatever it is they put on them and since the sign said the onion rings were the best you know one always believes signs I too had an order with a shake. And I wonder why I am a fat old man. 

It took very few minutes to get my order and off to the room I go. Well the burger was a mushy mess of no distinct tastes, I truly hated it and the onion rings were bland at best. The shake... ok.

It was mentioned that we should stop at a fatburger the other day and this memory popped up and I shuddered, never again..."}
{"text":"Used to be the best burger joint on the strip pre Shake Shack. Great burgers and shakes. The outside patio/bar is great for people watching or just watching a game on one of the tvs. Good drink/food specials. Great service. Open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"When I called the store I got someone on the phone and she said \"Hold On.\"
She put the phone down and for 5 minutes all i heard was background noise and her voice taking orders from other customers.
My wife and I walked in about 15 minutes later and noted there were a total of 5 people on duty with one register open.

We got a number while we waited for our order.
A server walked around looking for number \"39\" She was announcing \"Number Thirty Nine?\" \"39?\"
We were # 40!

Three minutes later someone walked out with our order. It had the number 39 written on the bag!

We started to TRY to expedite our order by a phone call. 
Not the case!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of fatburger and have been to 3 locations in Vegas and Henderson. Today was our first time at Green Valley Ranch location thanks to Groupon. What a let down this place is! The meat was completely dry, although still slightly pink inside, and very bland. If you've been to Fatburger before you know how juicy there burgers are! Not here.... and just to top it off the soda machine only dispensed flat soda.... Don't bother coming here, even with a Groupon."}
{"text":"Fat Burger is (greater than symbol) In-n-Out Burger

Being from Texas I am pretty snobby when it comes to burgers. I always compare other fast food chains with my beloved Whataburger. A couple of years back I tried In-n-Out and it didn't quite stack up. This time around I'd figure I try out Fat Burger and see how well it fares. i must admit, I can see why they call it Fat Burger. You can get an XXL burger which is 24 ounces of pure beef goodness. Even this Texan isn't stupid enough to get that! I only got the large (8oz) fat burger with bacon, cheese, and fried egg on top along with fat fries and a diet coke. haha ok I kid on the diet coke. I enjoyed every artery clogging morsel and dare I say it was better than Whataburger?!?!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Impossible burger and paid 17$ for fries and the burger. 
Got it home to find out it was a bocca patty. WTH? 
I have bocca patties at home. I would pay that much for something I can make at ho e for a fraction of the cost. 
Oh and if you pay with credit card, the workers told us they don't get the tip if you write one in...only get to split the cash in the jar."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious! Always heard of Fatburger but never had them..well they definitely did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Ate here on NYE. Ordered out and it took a while, which is normal for fat burger since they are made to order. The food was good and we were stuffed. We will be back. Thank you"}
{"text":"Just paid $14 for a turkey burger fries and soda. Could have gone to McDonald's.  Used to love this place.   Won't be back. Just by tasting one fry I can tell they haven't changed their oil in a long long time."}
{"text":"The veggie burger is the best in town!! Everything else is a little shaky with attitude by the employees and the inability to get orders right at the drive thru. I suggest going inside to order. The prices are also crossed off on the drive thru board so sticker shock of 29 bucks for two shakes, fries, and one veggie one turkey burger. I'll just get the burger next time and make the rest at home."}
{"text":"They're open 24 hours for a reason: it's the best burger on the Strip morning, noon, and night. 

Fresh burger patties, fresh toppings, and great service. Every time I'm in Vegas, I make sure to get me a Fat Burger! :D"}
{"text":"A really good burger and love the fat fries!!! They need to come to NY. what would a skinny burger be anyway?"}
{"text":"When I went here it was a good expierence. The staff was nice and top of it. The place smells fresh and is clean. If you want a burger don't waste your time at fast food. This place has it all. Their Burgers are very good and very well cooked, it's very fresh and their shakes are good as well!  The burgers are big but worth the taste it is called Fat burger for a reason and I will consider coming back here!"}
{"text":"I was just out here a month ago, and wow this Fatburger location is great. Ordered i believe a triple burger to go with everything on it. The fries are slamming big time yum. I decided to come over and grab some food to take home at 1:30am . This location also has a bar outside of it, nice outside bar. Had a few drinks talking and chatting with some of the locals. Fatburgers in L.A are not as good as they used to be, but there are great spots in Los Angeles for a good fatburger. Really recommend eating at this strip location."}
{"text":"We went in here tonight. We weren't really hungry so we were gunna split a burger. We ordered the baby burger and it was incredibly small. We had to go buy another. Its overpriced in my opinion. The fries were alright. I like crispy fries so I was disappointed. The burgers were good but they better have been for what we paid for them. My wallet is still angry with me."}
{"text":"Decent prices for being on the strip and fries are yummy (but if they added seasoning it could be sooo much better) and the burgers are pretty good too! Get a shake while you are there. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome little spot on the strip! 5 of my friends held up here to watch the Super Bowl they had the game on and weren't mad that we sat there for 4 hours with a pretty low tab we had been hung over from a heavy night of drinking. Bar tenders were awesome and super friendly the staff was awesome as well! The male bar tender took care of us and he knew we were hurting, took his time and didn't push food or drinks. 

Once we warmed up and got some water in our systems we had an awesome time chicken strips were amazing and the fries were light and crispy!"}
{"text":"my first time trying fatburger and it was good but didn't quite live up to the hype. got a babyfat with cheese, eggs, bacon, and grilled onion. i love that you can add eggs to the burger and the price for all the add-ons isn`t bad. the burger patty had a good flavor to it but i think overall i was expected it to have more of a wow factor. maybe jucier or a special sauce? i don`t know

i like that this location is off the strip so probably not as busy. it was pretty empty when we came. but we were in a group of maybe 10-15 people and they messed up (or forgot?) about 4 of our orders. the people at the end of our group ended up waiting days for their orders, having to actually go up to the counter, show their receipts and wait even longer up there. i could see other customers getting their orders with confusion and it seemed like the cooks were getting their orders wrong too? another person in our group placed an order of just french fries and waited a pretty long amount of time for them, then when they finally came out, they were cold!

good burger, not the BEST service/experience. i`d def still eat here again though"}
{"text":"The veggie burgers here are AMAZING! We ended up eating here a couple times late night & the guys that cook late are super nice, friendly, funny, awesome & the food tasted great!!

The boca burgers are really good & full of flavor, with all the veggies added & a side of fries, it's all I was craving at 2am!

Its nice to find a burger place that knows how to also make veggie burgers really well!!"}
{"text":"Was braucht man in den USA - ja genau einen guten Burger!

Und wie der Name es schon sagt, die Burger hier sind - FAT!

Die Einrichtung ist wie in fast jedem Burger-Laden.  Es gibt verschiedene Größen an Burger - von M bis XXL. Nach der Bestellung bekommt man ein Nummern-SChild und muss warten, da die Burger frisch gemacht werden! Dafür sind sie super lecker, fast wie selbst gemacht! Aus die Soßen sind super.

Ich hatte einen XL Burger - und war mehr als satt!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed tonight. I ordered through the drive through. Not only was my order incorrect, my burger was cold. I waited 25 minutes in line. There were 5 other cars behind me!"}
{"text":"Not much to say here. Good juicy burgers, will definitely stop by again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Please avoid this restaurant, always understaffed and food is not good.

First, when I ordered , lady rolled her eyes at me like I was messing up her day. Second, messed up and did not make my shakes. Also, they delivered the food in a tray when it was a to go order.

Once I tried the burgers, it was a real disappointment, sloppy and flavorless.

Definitely better burger joints in town."}
{"text":"Great burger chain, I just hate this one particular restaurant that's on the strip.

Dirty on the outside and horribly crowded on the inside. You'll see all sorts of people in the inside from the business professional to the dirty street hookers. What's important is that they're actually pretty well behaved since they've all walked off the alcohol I guess. This place is crowded as hell and it will take you a while to get your food.

I ordered the king burger and a peanut butter shake and ate it all. The food was great but the waitline was just way way too long. We should have just gone through the drive through and then sat inside or something. (This technique works well at crowded In-N-Outs.)"}
{"text":"I have never been to Fatburger before and it's right outside the movie theatre I frequent, so we went early to stop for lunch.  Groupons are great!  Now I like hamburgers and fries, but my daughter LOVES them.  And Fatburger didn't disappoint either of us.  The burgers were juicy and cooked just right.  We also ordered bacon on them, and the bacon was cooked nice and crisp with thick slices, none of that see through crap you get at lots of burger joints.  Curly fries were nice and hot and fresh.  And when you have all you can drink diet coke, that's like a big fat cherry on top of a hot fudge sundae!  This place was great, a little expensive for a hamburger place, but really good nonetheless.  We will definitely stop back, especially since we walk right past it at least twice a month when we go to the movies.  Yum."}
{"text":"Fatburger just opened in the area not to long ago. I was surprised to see so many different burgers offered. I tried the original with the tumble weed chips. The chips taste better than Sputniks and the burger was juicy but also not greasy compared to the others. My favourite part is the fact that you could add an onion ring for free and the texture and taste is phenomenal!

The shakes are actually made with ice cream and my wife loves it. Would definitely come back with the entire family!"}
{"text":"Showed up mid-week about 10pm so there were more workers than customers. Burger was better than some other spots. A bit pricy but that's what you get for eating on the strip. Our waitress was nice but the service was lacking when we needed stuff, we had to look around for someone to bring it. Got to watch the bartender to his best \"cocktail\" impersonation."}
{"text":"Ate here once and that will probably be enough. There wasn't necessarily anything wrong with the burger, but at this price, you are pushing into \"gourmet\" burger territory and gourmet this ain't.  Frankly this a step up in price from the Five Guys and In-N- Outs of the world and a noticeable step down in quality. As such, I can't say I really see a reason to eat here."}
{"text":"The rudest worst service ever. Not only was the guy at the counter rude and told my brother \"no, it's too late\" when he wanted to change his drink to a shake before the order was even sent in, he also got the order completely wrong and got nasty when we asked for it to be corrected. Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"NOT 24 HOURS!!!! Several times in the las month have tried to go here late/middle of the night while at the casino and it's closed! Don't advertise that you're 24 hours if you are going to close in the middle of the night. Wish I could give ZERO stars!"}
{"text":"The hamburger was dry and so was the bun. The cheese sticks were the frozen kind. The beer was $8 even though we had a Bogo coupon. I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I hope the young adults working here honestly make $15 or more an hour because every time I come though the staff is attentive, and courteous. Never had a problem with my order. My Triple X is always seasoned properly, and cooked to perfection in a timely manner. There should be a tip jar in the drive thru, those cooks are working hard. The meat mixture they're using is flavorful, and has great texture. Fatburger on Flamingo is my go to grub spot."}
{"text":"I usually like this place and it's a regular for my moms lunch or snack spot. I got the small fat a good size when your not all too hungry but need a quick fix to your hunger pangs. The onions rings are ok just a tad bit greasy. My burger I had it better maybe at the green valley ranch location and perhaps I should have specified medium. My burger was a bit too hard on the edges the meat wasn't all to tasty as it use to be. I think I'll be sticking to eating garnished at green valley ranch instead"}
{"text":"Wow. I've never been to such a slow fatburger. I ordered a burger and fries - no one in line, and 1 burger in process ahead of me, and it took more than 30 minutes. I don't think the cook was aware you can start another order while one was on the grill.
  The quality was standard Fatburger - it's a chain.
  Don't come unless you have lots of time."}
{"text":"They make one of my favorite burgers but good things only come to those who wait. Her, you will definitely wait.  They are slow. The place is run down and looks shady but the food is good. They messed up my drive through order today so you might have to check your food before leave."}
{"text":"Now I have eaten at several FatBurgers and this location has got to be the worst! My burger was the driest, thrown together burger I've ever had got home took 2 bites and was pissed!!! My fries were cold as ice! I will Never go back"}
{"text":"Worst hamburger I've had in a long time, and I paid $22 for two SMALL burgers, two fries and a small shake. The bun was squished, meat over cooked and dry. We won't be back. Even Jack in the Box is better than this, and probably half the price."}
{"text":"The food was satisfactory, but definitely NOT worth the price. I had to wait forever, and it wasn't that busy at the time, either. The service could have been a lot better."}
{"text":"I still love their food every now and then for an indulgence and I'm not petty when it comes to bad service usually as everyone has a bad day. Today, I was craving Fatburger, one car ahead of me, sat at the order screen for 5 minutes before a shallow voice came over asking can I help you? Ordered my food, forgot to say everything on the burger but he never asked. I decided to just tell him instead of waiting. Pulled up. Car in front leaves, he's in the window. Opens it and ...........complete silence........ No read back, no hello, no total given. Just silence and looking at me. I hand him my money knowing the total from the order screen. He hands me my change, no words are spoken. This is really odd to me! Why would you have your drive up window person be someone who is socially rude? I don't get it. The name on my receipt read Break and below that initials DT. Management - please get someone else to work the window!!! This young man is not the type of person you want handling face to face contact with customers. My food came and he opened the window looked at me,  I must have been sitting there waiting for a word and he just hands the bag and closes the window. No thank you, have a good night, nothing!  I don't get it.  Maybe I'll just start going inside now when the dining room is still open. The drive in seems to hire those making their paycheck with little to no effort or enthusiasm. I'm not requesting cheerleading chants when I receive my change but a simple smile and thank you would be nice?! I've sat at that order screen twice before and was never helped. I drove away. Today was the third disappointing experience and my god if In and Out Burger had turkeyburgers, I'd be there instead. If Fuddeuckers opens up on this side of town, we'll have to part ways Fatburger."}
{"text":"I only ever go here when my boyfriend is craving a greasy, tasteless fatburger. I can't stand these things. Like another poster said, they just make me hungry for In-n-out."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for the Red Rock, probably the best place within the food court area.

Fatburger is a legendary So Cal burger staple, with Ice Cube rappin' about it (\"...Two in the mornin' got the Fatburger\") on his hit \"It was a Good Day\" 

I prefer it over In and Out, Five Guys, Johnny Rockets, The Counter, The Habit and most other over the counter non-fast food, cooked to order burger joints.

In LA, I usually get the Fatburger on the char grill and fat fries (as opposed to on the greasy grill with skinny fries)

In Vegas, I opted for another of my favorites, the Bacon and Egg sandwich.  It's really good, but tell 'em to skip the mayo and put on ketchup instead, it'll taste better.

I've not gone to LBS which is a sit-down burger restaurant in the Red Rock, so can't compare this to that.

With Fatburger... The prices are good, it stays open late, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"24-Hours, Drive-Thru action... And d@yum good BLT w/Egg breakfast sandwiches :-D. My weekly weekend treat!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Fatburger! This location is awesome no matter what time I visit and it's always a pleasure when Vladimir is my Server. Don't forget to get your discount if you go to the movies that day at Sunset."}
{"text":"I wish their was a zero star option. The person at the register said he could not even take my order for at least 10 minutes because he had people before me. Learn to multitask. All he had to do was take my order and throw a patty on the griddle."}
{"text":"Burger was ok. Needs a refresh/update. It's inside the casino so plan on a smoky atmosphere."}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner after seeing the Blue Man Group. Since it was the 4th of July the Vegas Strip was crowded. Neither of us were in mood for a fancy sit-down place and most of the fast food places had long line. On the way to see the fireworks at Caesars Palace, we saw this place and there were plenty of places to sit outside so we decided to eat here. 

I had a veggie burger and my husband had a burger with a single patty. I thought it was fine as I expected to be. Since it was too hot to eat a lot of food, we didn't order anything to go with the burger. I thought the portion was just right.

Service was fine."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and I have heard how Fatburger is amazing and all, so I came in with high expectations but it was okay. For my taste the hamburgers were too oily and the burgers didn't have any special flavor."}
{"text":"After eating here, I appreciated more living in TX where the mighty Whataburger is King! :-) Five Guys is even better than Fatburger. Although my burger was overloaded with pepper, it was good but nothing to rave about. I will give it another try. 

Eat Up!"}
{"text":"My double Turkey Burger with sweet potato fries was everything especially after being in the pool for a few hours and we had the plain Buffalo wings those were great also.. Now for the drinks they were kinda light but affordable  wouldn't buy drinks from there again."}
{"text":"Good food! I always love the \"cook2order\" thing.. Fun and friendly but wish they still had the jukebox!"}
{"text":"Fatburger is the African-American version of Johnny Rocket's.

In order to create a Fatburger, you take the Johnny Rocket's old school diner feel and replace the Elvis, Roy Orbison, and Jerry Lee Lewis with the Aretha Franklin, Al Green, and the Jackson 5. The music here has me \"all shook up,\" but it has my, \"r-e-s-p-e-c-t.\" I love it.

Fatburger also takes the complicated Johnny Rocket's menu, eliminates 75 percent of it, and makes you focus on how you want your burger and what kind of fries you want. Ordering is like, \"A-B-C, easy as 1-2-3.\"

You first pick the size of your burger. By size, it means in terms of patty size (2.5, 5.3, 8, 16, and 24 ounces). I am not sure who can eat a 2 pound burger, but until I weigh 400 pounds or I am high on government grade grass, I'll stick to the 5.3 ounce patty. Plus, there's only so much meat I can fit in my mouth.

You then pick the toppings. The burgers come loaded with fresh lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles (unless you say otherwise), but you get to add to your \"Fatburger\" experience with four extra toppings: cheese, bacon, chili, and/or an egg. Personally, I always roll with cheese and bacon. But under the influence of Las Vegas, I have added chili and an egg and it while it was different, it was still delicious. Yum. Burp. Fart.

If you want fries, you get two options: skinny fries or fat fries. The former is thin and crispy, and the latter are more like steak fries. Honestly, they are both really good. This is like having to choose between Betty and Veronica. And just like Archie, I can't truly commit to either option. 

So I pick one or the other on each visit, but never both at the same time. You have to keep your options open and never let them know you are savoring both. Now that's \"true playa\" status, right there. Ya feel me?

Also, the milk shakes shakes are wonderful. You have try one at least once. They have five different flavors: chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, Maui-Banana, and Oreo Cookies & Cream. You can't go wrong with either, but I suggest the vanilla, strawberry, and cookies & cream options. They are just so thick and creamy. That's what she said.

In addition to all of this, the service is stellar. But since it's set up is not a sit down restaurant, you don't need to tip. I guess Fatburger eliminated the tipping from Johnny Rocket's too. So you are left with great burgers, at a good price, in a cool environment.

Needles to say, I'm a fan of the African-American Johnny Rockets: Fatburger."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite burger joint ever. It might sound exaggerative but out of all places I've tried, Fat Burger rules supreme. The patty including the bun and everything else between is refreshingly... fresh! A juicy flavorful patty, the variety of ingredients and the french fries are great too. It's unfortunate we don't have one up here in AK but every trip I take to Las Vegas, it's my first and last place I eat there. Highly recommend and the service is great also."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The food amazing and the service is excellent. The cook, who's name I didn't get, was very nice and the cashier Jessie has nice sense of humor and gives excellent customer service. Very satisfied with my visit. Thank you."}
{"text":"It was 1AM and I'm walking back to Polo Towers after a hard evening of gambling in New York, New York, MGM and Monty Carlo.  I was hungry but didn't want a full-sized meal costing over $80 for one person on the strip.  Plus most places were closed ... even Hard Rock was closing.  There was Denny's but I wanted something more.

As I passed the local FatBurger I noted people were there eating, the bar was was open and there were heat lamps ... so I stopped for a visit.  Ordered a Med burger, steak fries and Onion Rings.

I like my fries crunchy/crispy and thats what I got.  Fabulous crispy fries and the onion rings were just as good.  Crunchy and the onions were soooo tasty.  I was in heaven.  The burger was med cooked and very juicy.  But it needed seasoning.  

Overall my visit to FatBurger was a hit!"}
{"text":"I liked what I had ordered which was a Hawaiian which had bacon, pineapple, Swiss, teriyaki.  My burger wasn't crazy large but it was the size I wanted. We had a variety of sides which consisted of Cajun cut chips, fries, bacon poutine. 

This is the only Fat Burger in the GTA just north of Promenade mall in Thornhill. 

While I wouldn't necessarily drive all the way to Thornhill just for this place if I'm not too far I would come back to try some of the different burgers. 

For the price it is not bad since you can basically choose your size from small to super large over a pound and even more I'd you wanted. I give it an a-OK."}
{"text":"im a FAN. seriously. i love me some double doubles animal style... but cmon... the fatburger - king burger - is just as awesome.

LEAN beef... everything on it (except lettuce for me) and add cheese... i love it. i usually order my in n outs without sauce, ketchup and mustard only... so this KING burger is pretty much perfect.

BOCA or TURKEY burger for my wifey... god bless her sexy self... so if she can eat a burger where i eat a burger... we are both happy...

FAT FRIES. done son. smother in salt and ketchup. thats the shizzle. fo sho."}
{"text":"For convenience sake, we popped in here for our last meal in Vegas.  It's expensive.  It's dirty.  It's greasy.  It's messy.  It's scary.  It's Fatburger.  It's delicious!  
I got the \"Fat Deal\" combo for $10.  I love the \"fat\" fries (steak cut fries), and the fact that they put both relish AND pickles on the burgers.  We braved the Vegas clientele, and ate our food there.  When it's your last night in Sin City, and you haven't had any luck at the casinos, you might find yourself blending into the Fatburger crowd at midnight."}
{"text":"I feel completely humiliated. I was at your drive through and it took 10 min for someone to acknowledge my I was there. They said they would be right with me. 15 min went by And nothing... cars started honking and couldn't do anything because there was a car in front of me. The car in front of me left and STILL no one asked for my order. I went inside and told them I've been waiting and again no one in your staff said a word. They ignored me like I didn't exist. The car behind me was asking if the store was getting robbed, and they turned off the sound. It was unbelievable..."}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon. We got Cheddar Fatburger /w fries for 2. All I got to say is...there's nothing special about the burger or the fries. The only outstanding thing are their sky high prices. If I didn't have a Groupon, this deal (2 burgers + fries) would have cost me around $25 which is ridiculous. With the Groupon, the price is just \"Ok\". 

If you just think about how burgers are made, there really isn't a lot of culinary skill involved. Watching the staff put together my burger made me realized anyone with a pulse can do it. I don't like places that charge a premium for no reason other than being famous. 

Is it better than McDonald's? Yes but that's not a hard benchmark to beat. The burger tasted like any other mid-level chain's. Worth my money? No. Will not return."}
{"text":"I've been having a Vegas affair with Fatburger ever since I've been going out to the strip.  

Located just south of the center of the strip, this 24hr burger joint brings the flavor.  They offer burgers, chicken, turkey, and veggie burgers so they are sure to please any crowd (drunk or sober).  They have killer steak fries and their add-ons (egg, cheese, etc) make the possibilities endless.  Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating as well as full bar options just add on the awesomeness of this place.  

Long story short, when you're needing drunk munchies food on the strip, this place delivers.(not like actual delivery to your room/location, but more a metaphorical delivery).  Boosh."}
{"text":"Overpriced! You're better off going across the street to Five Guys  (you'll save quite a bit of money, too).  I'll admit that the shakes are good, but not good enough to pay almost twenty bucks for dinner for two!

Not impressive at all."}
{"text":"Stopped in as a tradition in Vegas to sit on the patio and yep, the 2 for 1 drink coupons at the front were going around. (pay for one and get the second one free) It was the most beautiful day ever so nothing beats being able to have a light lunch and have a small (ok, med is the smallest available) burger. 
We skipped the fries, onion rings - we just had burgers. You order inside, pay, grab your number on a stick and grab a table. Our server was spotty, saw her once only and then an Angel called Roberto took over to help us and he never missed a beat. LOVED HIM so much we called out a manager from his office to tell him what a great employee he had in him. It takes more effort to give a nasty complaint about someone than a good one, right? We will miss chatting with him, at least til the next time we come back!
We had the best afternoon watching the Vegas world go by.
The music was great and not too loud over the lunchtime.
Our burgers came out hot, fresh, good-salty and cooked to order. It was busy and the food is cooked in the order it comes in of course so relax while you wait with a drink and enjoy the sights, tunes and staff.
Next time I come here, screw it, I am cheating and getting the onion rings. They are to die for!"}
{"text":"Good burger & this Vegan would eat there again if you lower your price, $14.99 + tax is too much for a fast food place. Other locations are $8, why not this one?"}
{"text":"I heard the hype about this place so I checked it out.  My burger was really dry.  :(  I'd just go to In-n-Out instead next time."}
{"text":"Not as good as In-n-Out, but a solid late night choice.  The wait can be pretty long since everything is made to order, but it's worth the wait if you are comparing to the McDonald's next door!"}
{"text":"Great location, hours, juicy burgers, great customer service. It's a simple burger spot, don't expect anything else. I got the XXXL burger \"challenge\" and it was tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Im not one to write bad reviews, I firmly believe if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all. But this needs to be said. 

I'm sitting here watching a man with scruffy grey facial hair cook. He has thrown down raw patties, cracked some raw eggs on the grill, built all of the burgers he was cooking and wrapped them up. He then proceeded to clean the grill and his station. 
Unfortunately, he still hasn't changed his gloves. He's just wiping his dirty gloves on his dirty apron. 
A couple approached the woman at the counter and let her know what they saw, because I'm not the only one staring at these violations, and she said he was \"supposed to do that\". 
The kitchen is a mess, the floor is a mess, the restaurant is a mess. 
This is really pretty disgusting...I wouldn't eat here if I were you. I know I'm not going to."}
{"text":"YUM! I order my food on my lunch break, and it is ready when I get there. the staff is friendly. service is quick. and food is delicious - what more could I ask for?!"}
{"text":"Generally I love Fatburger, HOWEVER, STAY AWAY from this location! Staff did not even ask me how I want my burger cooked, it came dry and tasteless! I will NOT be going to this Fatburger again."}
{"text":"Their burgers without a doubt are some of the best burgers in town. They have 5 different sizes of burgers to meet any man's appetite. They are juicy and flavorful and that's all I can really ask from a burger place.  But the burgers are so freaking expensive that I can't justify coming here without a groupon. The meal is not worth the price.

I will say the service is pretty poor though. Every time I come in, it doesn't matter who is working the register, but I always get such a despondent look from the people when I start giving my order. Ok, so I'm sorry I make your life a little bit more difficult because I don't want everything on it. But for goodness sake, it's really not that complicated. They literally sigh when I give my order. Buns extra toasted, mustard no mayo, tomatoes and lettuce. Maybe I'll drop off the Cheer Up album by Reel Big Fish the next time i'm here.

Moving on, the chicken sandwiches are pretty tasty  that it makes me forget for a little bit how much I hate their service. Doesn't matter if its grilled or crispy, they both come out well, but honestly this place is known for their hamburgers so I would say that if you are chicken sandwich connoisseur that's it not really worth your time or money. 
Their seasoned curly fries make an excellent combo with their choco milkshake. Perfectly seasoned fries with a really thick and creamy milkshake. 

P.S. No matter what you order and no matter if the place is completely empty, it will take on avg 10-15 minutes to get your order. I understand that everything is made when you order, but seriously a 15 minute wait in an empty restaurant is pretty ridiculous?
I would say stay away from this place unless someone else is buying or you have a coupon, the burgers are good, but the time and money expected at this place is not justified.  However,  if you only want a shake and seasoned curly fries, then definitely go here."}
{"text":"A friend of ours said we HAD to visit Fat burger's when we were in Vegas. He was completely right! Fat burger did not disappoint. The burger was delicious! The dressings they put on the burgers are unique and the sandwich was mouthwatering."}
{"text":"The sign on the building says OPEN 24 HOURS, but it is NOT. Then they have a separate sign taped to the door saying their hours. They really close at 10 PM every day. The food is good, but it is false advertising."}
{"text":"Fast food served slow!  Be ready to wait at least 20 min after ordering and be sure to double check your orders if taking togo. 

And, where's my hubby's bacon?  I still haven't heard the end of the $1 charge that never materialized.  Take it from us if you want your fries skinny, you have to ask because they're not going out of their way to clarify your desires."}
{"text":"We Went to see Nashville unplugged a country concert and then went to eat at Fatburger, the burger was okay, but we got fries that was cold and 2 drinks  the bill was over $30 for 2 burgers for what we got and the price was charged it is not worth it and we will not be back!"}
{"text":"Yum, I love fatburger and I'm not surprised that this location in Vegas is no different. This is just your average fat burger place but with the extra spice of Vegas included at no extra charge! The burgers are delicious, the service is 24 hours so unlike everything else, it's when you want and what you want. You can order up a notch if you're really hungry. They have the best fries as well and everything from veggie to major meat head. 

I recommend walking here though, because if you drove there's more or less no parking!"}
{"text":"Good burger, nice amount of toppings and great location.

They accommodate gluten free pretty well too!

I have been to many of their locations in LA and I always love it.
100% real beef burger is what you get."}
{"text":"Good location on the strip and open 24 hrs a day. Looks dirty from the outside, but inside while nothing to write home about, it is just fine. The line although long, moved rather quickly. I had a large Fatburger meal. My burger was very good and just the right size. The skinny fries were also quite good and similiar to the fries you would get at McDonald's. The prices are kind of high for fast food, but what can you expect for a place in the middle of the Vegas strip. If you are drunk and in need of late night eats, you would be well served going to Fatburger and getting the grease you need to fight tomorrow's inevitabe hangover."}
{"text":"Food was Delicious!! The cashier was very kind and patient, since I'd never been there I had a couple questions but she answered them all and I was very happy with our order."}
{"text":"Me:  \"Fatburger?  Never heard of them!\"
One of my friends suggested, \"I hear they're pretty good.\"
We decided to try it.

Both my friends and I agreed.  This might be a good burger if you're drunk, but it was pretty bad while sober.  While my friends ordered their own combinations I went with the medium Fatburger deal omitting cheese and onions on my burger and choosing the fat fries over the skinny fries.

Although this place looks and operates very much like a fast food place it is not.  The burgers are cooked to order so definitely expect a wait for your food order to be called.  If you order a soft drink it's self serve.  That part I liked about Fatburger because I can control how little ice and how much soft drink actually goes into the cup.

However, back to the burger.  My number was called and a worker delivered the burger tray to me.  The first thing I noticed was how small the burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw?select=2v29rPxqQNAWVXQlLTyqPQ) was compared to how large the portion of steak fries were.  I love thick fries which is why I selected the Fat Fries over the skinny ones.  These were a huge disappointment even though they were nice and meaty and fried to a perfect golden yellow color.  The fault was in the oil which tasted old, and because of that the fries didn't taste fresh.  You'd be surprised how big a difference there is just by changing the oil in a fryer.

The burger was not good either.  The burger patty was so overcooked no moisture existed within the meat.  I might have been happy had there even been a glistening of grease within, but nope, chewing cardboard is probably the best comparison.  The shredded lettuce while crisp had the odd taste of being stored in a refrigeration unit badly in need of a box of baking soda.  I don't mind that they use pickle relish instead of pickle slices but even that tasted old.  It's kind of like when you go to Costco and stock up on too much of something and store it until the taste begins to waver.  The pickle relish did not have a fresh snappy taste to it.  The only ingredients which tasted fresh were the tomato slice, the bun and the mustard.

At the least the service was good and the workers are friendly.  I can honestly say I won't be back at a Fatburger restaurant anytime in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"I recently cheated on my pescabacontarianism (veggies, fish and bacon) diet to enjoy a burger while at a recent outing to a baseball game. 

I was excited to see something other than your standard hot dogs and nachos while walking around trying to find something to eat.  The excitement quickly faded once I was told the price for two combo meals.  Thankfully I had recently sold one of my kidneys on the black market so I was able to scrape together just enough to pay for the meals.

Hunger is indeed the best spice, the burger and fries went down without much of a fight.  Sadly since I have only one remaining kidney the odds are I won't be able to eat here again, unless I win the power ball of course."}
{"text":"I had a craving for a good burger to take out so I found this place on Yelp due to the positive reviews. 
The burgers are expensive for a fast food burger joint. I had the Ultimate BBQ burger combo with tumbleweed chips for $15.27 plus tax.  With the combo there's a choice of thin cut fries, curly fries or tumbleweed chips. 

Pros: 
Service. The staff are friendly and attentive. 
Toppings and beef are very fresh. The beef has a good meaty texture.
Chips are crisp and nicely dusted with some type of seasonings. 

Cons:
The BBQ sauce is way too sweet to be on a burger. It was overwhelming the beef.
The bacon is very thin, similar to McDonalds. 

Overall, the burger I tried was just okay. I'll probably come again to try something else on the menu, but definitely without the BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Fatburger in about 12 years.... I just went today and man was it good..... I got the XXL burger which is 16 ounces of ground beef and costs about $8.95 with cheese and no fries... It's a little bit of a wait if your going drive thru but it's worth it, the burger is definately one of my favorites and I'll be trying the XXXL burger next time I go which is 24 ounces of burger. Hopefully I can eat it completely."}
{"text":"2.5

I haven't had FB in years! All of them virtually closed up in the OC, I remember the one on Tustin Ave. and the one in Downtown Brea, back then the food was solid and I don't remember being as expensive as it is now! :/

Fast forward to a few weeks ago when my sister and her friends were in town, they treated me to dinner and majority of the time when I go out to eat I order off the kids meal because of my stomach issues. I ordered a kids cheeseburger meal and her friends shared one combo, somehow it came out to $22.00!! 

Are you kidding me? One kids meal and one combo (no frills, no double patties etc.) for $22.00?!! I can honestly say I feel ripped off! The burger was OK, nothing special, nothing like the Habit and even the Habit doesn't charge crazy prices like this! Did I mention we waited in the drive thru for almost 15 minutes?! We were the only ones in line and took ridiculously long!! I don't think I'd ever come back unless I was just downright begging for a FB!

{"text":"Talk about some great drunken munchies after a night out on the strip. This place cranks out burgers in minutes and there really good. There not In-and-Out good but still really good. The place does get crowded and packed and you also have to deal with alot of drunken people but overall not a bad place to go."}
{"text":"It's really a 3.5.   Solid burger joint with many size options up to 1 1/2lbs!  I recommend adding a fried egg and bacon to the burger.  The chili dog is pretty good, too.

Kind of small inside, but clean and friendly service."}
{"text":"I pulled a muscle in my back lifting luggage on my first day in Vegas, and my doctor called in a prescription for a muscle relaxer to the CVS across the street. We had never tried Fatburger before, but they are everywhere, so we thought they may be on a par with Five Guys. Mistake! Honestly, we would have enjoyed the McDonald's next door more. The driest, most tasteless hamburgers were served by the unhappiest servers I've ever seen. Please, fellow Yelpers, take heed!"}
{"text":"For a supposedly good burger chain, this place was not good.  First off, it was very overpriced for the quality.  The burger had no real flavor, and my bun was quite stale.  My wife and her friend got the regular sized burger, while my buddy and myself got the larger burger.  Both my wife and her friend got sick hours later, while my friend and I did not.  I had always wanted to try this place, and now know to skip it and go straight to in n out, or 5 guys.  I was very disappointed.  There are a ton of other great burger places around Vegas, so skip this one."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here drunk on my bachelor party the weekend of October 6th-9th. Drunkenly ordered, outstanding burger, and proceeded to leave my wallet upon leaving.

Retracing my drunken steps the following morning, I realized I left my wallet at Fatburger and immediately called. They said they did have my wallet and I proceeded there immediately. Thank the lord, my wallet was safe and sound. Thank you Fatburger. I will definitely be visiting on my next adventure to sin city."}
{"text":"Decent burger but not worth the money! Two of us had just burgers, sweet potato fries and drinks for $33! Outrageous! Will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"I really like Fatburger for what it is and it's great to have one In the food court at GVR.  The burgers are consistently good and tasty and the shakes are great too.  Personally I like in n out better, but change is good every once in a while...not to mention egg, bacon and chili!"}
{"text":"I just find it so obnoxious when fast food places put a tip option on their Interac. This one is forced tipping as well. So you have to choose between percent and dollar amount."}
{"text":"I love fatburger and will eat it any time I get a chance.  This is one of the pricier fast food joints as I paid $27 for 2 meals.  The fatburger needs no description!  You all know this tastes good.  I was definitely disappointed by the fat fries though. They tasted as if they had been frozen for a long time.  They definitely had a weird aftertaste.  I would suggest ordering the skinny fries as those were actually great!  The drive thru is open 24 hours but dining area has set hours."}
{"text":"I love this burger, but the bigger the order the messier it gets. I frankly don't give a damn because a Fatburger is about flavor, consistency and an overall quality product. It's not fancy. It's a burger stand, not one masked as a burger stand, and the food is made to order. The patty is formed right in front of you with some spice thrown on top. The fries are fresh cut and not frozen and you get the option of Fat fries or Skinny fries. Get the Fat fries. You decide what goes in your burger, but I get it all the way with both mustard and mayo. This time I went for the double. Dayum! It was huge and yes, it was messy but like I said it didn't bother me as I knew it was going to be one of the best burgers, EVER! The party was very juicy but not greasy. Whatever spice they throw in the party really brings out the flavor of the meat. The veggies are fresh and the fries are perfectly friend to a golden color. 

Every time I'm in LV Fatburger is my go-to place. If I visit Cali I make sure to find a Fatburger since there isn't one in Texas. Seriously give this place a try. I know it's not hyped up by Hollywood celebrities but remember they are probably paid to \"endorse\" that other California burger joint."}
{"text":"I never thought I would enjoy Fatburger, because I typically am not a fan of the type of hamburger that is taller than it is wide, where you bite into it and about a pound and a half of condiments dump into your lap.  That's why in the eternal war of In-n-Out vs. Fatburger, I would take In-n-Out.

But for whatever reason, I really do like this particular giganto-burger.  There is the kitsch of the classic hamburger stand, the chrome signs and lineage behind the thing.  Add to that a very simple menu with lots of choices for your made-to-order burger.  And the ingredients are generally very fresh.  Some combination of that makes a burger that is a great experience, instead of just a placeholder next to a mess of fries.

This particular Fatburger is very hit or miss as for service times.  You can go in at three or four in the afternoon, or very late at night, and get your food in no time and find many places to sit.  Or you can go right at noon and be monumentally screwed.  This place doesn't scale well, so you might have to give up and move on to something else if you hit a rush hour.

Oh, and Mr. Pibb!  I always love that stuff."}
{"text":"Great steak fries and delicious burgers. Makes a great late night meal. Grease and goodness."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting.  Horrible customer service and they are lucky I didnt go to higher people and complain. The manager was really rude and treated me like shit. She was mad when I asked for a new burger throwing my burger in th a trash and telling me I was a problem. Because it was morning and know one else was there she got away with it her terrible attitude. Dont go to this fatburger!"}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich and crispy thin fries were good. Also tried the Oreo shake which was thick and creamy and jam packed with Oreos! A good spot for a burger and fries, but not the best I ever had."}
{"text":"The food is incredible- I had the strawberry shake,fat fries, and veggie burger. It's always packed! Definitely worth the wait."}

She, Said it was the \"BEST IN TOWN\" and trust me we eat a lot of Burgers...  Wait time was about 7 minutes, as they cook everything fresh and boy were the fries hot... Trust me do the \"combo specials\" which will save you about $4 bucks...  Also this Fat Burger is not owned by the same group that owns the others in town... Have eaten at 4 of the others here in AZ plus ones in Calf. & NV...  THIS ISTHE BEST...  The only complaint (this is as a past fast-food owner)  they had 6 people behind the counter... Great for service, but must play heck with employee costs...

Great Food...  XXLDADE  (6\"4' 270 and love to eat)"}
{"text":"I orderer uber eats from this location. Took them about 30 mins to delivered to my place.
Anyways, their burger really fit with the name XXXL burger, pretty delicious. Only down thing is their buffalo wings, i order the mild type, which i expected to be atleast a little soft and spicy but it tasted a little to plain and the chicken was kinda hard. Over all it was a pretty good experience.:)"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  I must admit.. I was in Vegas and a bit under the influence!  I decided to take on the XXXL Challenge and demolished the burger.  I am now 'King of All Carnivores\", or in other words The Burger King.

Grab yourself a FAT BURGER."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Juicy, nice size, well cooked. Not the best, but a good, solid burger nonetheless. Just remember when you ask for everything on it, that means EVERYTHING... including relish, which I can't say I've ever had on a burger before. It is a bit on the pricey side for fast food, but hey - it's Vegas. Part of the reason it gets bumped up to a four is because of the atmosphere. The jukebox plays pretty good hip-hop/R&B and workers are friendly. Be wary of the bathrooms though... Not the cleanest.... Just a heads-up."}
{"text":"Sitting at my desk in my office, I could see a steady flow of coworkers returning from their lunch breaks with Fatburger soda cups. This was enough to make me crave a big, fat, juicy, heart clogging, carb-filled burger and fries. So one day I decided to venture out and have my own Fatburger experience.

I selected their King Burger combo meal because I always order more than I should. The meal consisted of a 1/2 pound burger, fries and a drink. I got the burger with all the fixins' and selected the fat fries. The total for the meal was $9.19.

Arriving before the lunch rush, there was almost no line. The order taker was friendly and didn't try to \"upsize me\" or sell me anything other than what I wanted. I waited a bit longer than I wanted for my meal, but I guess that is because they cook everything when it's ordered. My only complaint is that there were no suitable containers in which to take out ketchup. They had those little paper cup things but there was no top to keep the contents from getting all over my car. There were also none of those ketchup packets to be found so I left their establishment ketcupless.

Back in my office I found that the burger and fries actually look like what is on their menu which is a surprise. The size of the meal was very good and filled me up quite nicely and then some, so I guess the food and drink was a good value for my money. My only issue was the actual taste of the food. I found it very bland and average at best. They either need to better season their meat/bun/something or start using some \"secret sauce\" to flavor up their burgers. I had the same issue with the fries. Thankfully, I was able to pile on salt and steal some leftover ketcup packets from the community fridge."}
{"text":"The worst fries I have ever had.  Understand, I never met a potato I didn't like, but these were undercooked and lukewarm.

I would have brought them back on principle, but there was a line.  They were supposed to be a treat for a project just finished.  Yuck."}
{"text":"10PM and all the mainstream restaurants are no longer serving.  You hate walking aimlessly through smoky casinos looking for food.
So, if you're me, you walk up the strip.  And walk, and walk.  
Your food choices include Denny's, McDonalds, Harley-Davidson Cafe.
A sign for a new Brazilian-type restaurant shown on the side of the Krave building had me hopeful, but I walked a block in the wrong direction only to find there was no such place.  Arg.  But, it's good to know that if I'm ever looking for boys dressed like girls, Krave is the place to find them...

I digress.  I kept on walking and walking, and ended up at Fatburger.  It was good but the service was crazy slow.

I ate my Kingburger and fries, slurped down my shake, and steeled myself for another long walk back down the strip."}
{"text":"I came here on the last day of Burger binge week. I ordered the Yelp burger, A big, juicy, 6 oz AAA Angus beef burger topped with Canadian Cheddar and customized to your taste with your choice of mustard, relish, onion, pickles, tomato, lettuce and mayo (and 8 other free toppings!). All for $5! 

If I had to describe their burger using one word, I would go with \"Fresh\". Everything about it is fresh, from the Juicy patty to the crispy lettuce to the perfectly toasted bun. It was a little salty though. To be fair I asked for all the free toppings. I suggest that you minimize your toppings, don't be greedy like me.

Great friendly service. Establishment is a little compact with the exception of their spacey, clean, fancy washroom. Surely worth checking out."}

Fatburger with cheese and egg: 5/5 - I don't know how it could be any better. My friend saw my burger with an egg and said he got out-burgered.

Service: 3.5/5 - The staff was friendly, but very slow on my order. It wasn't that busy.
Ambience: 2/5 - It would be great if they had outdoor seating."}
{"text":"They took forever & messed up all our orders! 
Thanks guys you have terrible service."}

{"text":"Dinner on Tuesday, 8/4/15

Yay! They're 24 hours but what isn't in Las Vegas, right? We walked in and there was no wait in line. Apparently if you're a police officer in uniform, you get to eat for free. The cashier was super friendly and took our order down quickly.

Drinks are self-serve to the right of the kitchen. There's also outdoor seating where you can order alcoholic drinks. There were plenty of tables available to seat ourselves. The food came out in a reasonable time. We enjoyed our medium-sized fatburger with skinny fries. I've visited other Fatburger locations and they all seem to be consistent in flavor.

When I'm Vegas, I'd definitely keep Fatburger as an option for late night meals. Walgreens is right next door so it's convenient to do our shopping after we're done eating."}
{"text":"I was recently in Vegas for a week for business, and found myself needing to do lunch on the first day there. I have a thing about hotel food (don't), so I yelped to see what was around.  And lo and behold....RIGHT across the street from the Aria shows a Fatburger!  Hadn't eaten at one of these since I moved from LA, so off I went.

Typical setup - stand in line to order, get a #, go sit and wait.  But....the ordering....ahh.....first, a REAL burger, cooked to your specs.  Choice of size.  Choice of REAL cheese.  Choice of bacon.  Choice after choice after choice.  You know...like a REAL burger place (kinda knocks In-N-Out out of the category). 

Ordered the basic burger w/swiss and bacon (I know, I know...that's so unlike me...(cough)), along with a small fries and a diet coke.

Received my meal about ten minutes later...and it was JUST like I remembered them...divine.  Definitely recommended!!"}
{"text":"Ok.. when I first visited I was overwhelmed with the experience. Now I have a much more \"meh\" feeling towards this place. 

Compared to a lot of other places around town I find it slightly pricey. The burgers are better than any other fast food place.. but for the same price.. or a few bucks more you can enjoy gourmet burgers else where. 


I do recommend checking this out at least once to make up your own mind. This place also seems like a lot more fun during the summer --- more seating that's for sure."}

This is a great place to get a no frills solid meal. Next time would opt for regular french fries than the fresh chip thingies.

Its not the cheapest, but again, you get quality. Will be going back again!"}
{"text":"I went to Fatburger in Las Vegas late one night. I was expecting typical diner food. I did not feel like a beef burger, so I ordered the turkey burger.  I swear I heard trumpets and caught a glimpse of heaven when I bit into this burger. The burger was huge, however after the first bite it rapidly disappeared. 

The best turkey burger ever.

I'm happy to learn there is a Fatburger about an hour from me. I hope their turkey burger is good as the one in Vegas."}
{"text":"Located inside Red ROck Casino, there is ample parking, the hardest part is getting around the casino to find the food court. 
The ambiance is almost like a trashier version of johnny rockets with the red bar stools, simple American Food with burgers, shakes, fries, chili cheese dribbled onto everything. Although it seems they are making an attempt to be a little healthier with their new crispy chicken wrap (tortilla wrapped fried chicken with all the burger fixings on the inside). I mean the menu is by no means healthy. It is called FATburger- due to the quantity of food and the calories associated with that food. But as I watched them make our burger, I noticed they were not premade patties and they were using what seemed like \"not previously frozen- but who knows\" ground beef. Also it didn't seem like they were using binders (egg or breadcrumbs) 
As we ate our burger noticed the burger was kinda dry, probably due to the amount of add ons and very little mayo. Def had to ask for extra Mayo.
Large 1/2 pound 7.75$ 
Bacon: 1.25, cheese: American, cheddar, Swiss 1.00, chili 1.00, egg 1.00, guacamole 1.25, mushrooms 1.25
Sides: onion rings, fat fries, skinny fries, chili cheese fries 
Milkshakes: vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, cookies and cream/Oreo, Maui-banana (4.50)
Desserts include ice cream Sundays (2.10) and root beer floats (2.40)

Pretty pricey esp with a meal

B) large 1/2lb 13.50
C) XXL 1lb 15.80
D) XXXL 1.5lbs 19.00

I might even like it better than that other burger joint.  Yeah, you know the one.

Their selection is the best for a fast food restaurant - regular burgers, turkey burgers, veggie burgers and chicken sandwiches all make an appearance on the menu.  You can get chili or bacon added on or, if you're feeling particularly British, a fried egg.  The option or fat or skinny fries rules and now it looks like they even have a wedge salad.  Whoa!

Now I know what I'm getting for lunch."}

Will definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger, and there are lots of condiments to it.  The only thing was, I wanted to add cheese and an egg, but that would mean that I would have to spit out an extra $1.98... almost another babyfat burger.... I wish they could have made those additions a tad cheaper.

Fat fries are YUM :D"}
{"text":"This place will not be around for long.  With the high level of GTA competition in the burger world these days, customers demand the best.

Fatburger fails in many areas, but let's focus on food failures.  The burger meat is dry and tough.  No love was put into forming these patties.  Whether it's overworked or low quality beef to start, doesn't matter because the end result is bad.  Fries are clearly frozen, the insides were freezer burnt.

We demand freshness and quality control and won't stand for American franchises like this that don't deliver."}
{"text":"I love fat burger and their prices are quite steep.  This location use to have the best staff ever.  Now the staff is horrible and the food taste like it was a pile of slop.

I order a burger NO cheese please, no relish please no mustard just mayo.
WOW I get home which is quite a distance from this fat burger and guess what?
My burger has CHEESE stuck to the bread couldn't get it off.  If I ate it I would end up in the hospital.  MUSTARD all over the thing dripping out , IHATE mustard.  And Relish on the burger that it was soggy by the time I got home.  I HATE relish.  
This is more then 1 occasion where I have had this horrible experience at this location.  Today was the last time . I will NEVER go back here.  The staff is rude and I don't know if there is a language barrier or they are just flat out stupid but even the management lacks what is needed in this place.  Now I understand why they are so slow.  Too bad for the owner of this business because im sure if it keeps going the way it is it wont be in business to much longer.  
FROM the DISGUSTED customer."}
{"text":"Yum!  I loved my veggie burger with cheese and skinny fries.  I will get that again.  Might even try the steak fries!!  Got the lemonade which was good but I wish they had fresh brewed iced tea instead."}
{"text":"If you love a good burger, not dry at all, with a soft bun and real juicy beef, then you will love fat burger, its a most eat if your a burger lover now if you think mc donalds is better then wendys then dont go to fat burger your taste in food is way off most people like Comercial burger spots but i scout a good burger wherever i go so to sum this one up,

 go during the day to avoid the night time drunks and make sure you grab a Guinness on tap and enjoy a DOUBLE 1POUND XL BURGER WITH CHEESE."}
{"text":"I have been to the other fatburger down at deerfoot, so I thought I would compare the 2 and also  comment on my latest visit. 
This location is significantly smalller than the one at Deerfoot, but for some reason I liked it better. I dunno, maybe it was the brightness of the location, there are lots of windows and it was a nice sunny day! 
However there were less booths here than at thier other location and I like booths. 
There is alot of more available parking here than at Deerfoot ( deerfoot gets nuts).

As is typical of Fatburger the food was hot, fresh and tasty. I had the veggie burger( I think its the best in town, if not the best  I have ever had)and onion rings. The onion rings were excellent, hot, crispy, with full rings under the crunchy batter. Drinks here are serve yourself and unlimiited and your order is always served with a large paper ramekin of Heinz ketchup. 
They have really nice seasoning salt on the table which I quite enjoy.
You have to wait a few minutes while they cook your order- to order. 
All in all, I have to say Fatburger is great, and so is this location."}
{"text":"Fail burger,  13 $ for a burger fries and coke?, a 15 min wait only to find out they gave my order a way . a half hearted apology from the frycook who is either high or drunk. The manager and staff seem like they rather be somewhere else"}
{"text":"Fantastic casual meal with friends! Waitress was delightful!! Drinks and service very good."}
{"text":"If I could give it negative ten I would this location needs to close it's dirty people are rude and every one of the 6 burgers we ordered were wrong"}
{"text":"Great place for all day breakfast. Supervised by the great service! Got the XL breakfast. It feed me and my 2 year old son. Fun music playing too.1"}
{"text":"Ate here twice while in town and each time my burger was over cooked ,  it was tough. I only ordered a second time cuz the first fries were big and nice edible, good my second order not so much even the fries were over cooked. Not worth $35-$45 dollars for two people each time with and without drinks I'll pass, they were  crowded they rushed but gave awful food. Check your food before you leave each time was carry out. I'm used to fatburgers LA where there not only fat but juicy not dried out and hard."}
{"text":"2.5 stars

I wish the burger was better, granted I went at like 2am but still I was expecting more for my first FATBURGER experience. The bun seemed a bit dry and the burger was sliding around the bun a lot, huge turnoff. The fries were alright I was just hoping it was gonna be like an in and out with some beer to go with but not the case. I'd try it again in hopes it would be more like how it is in my dreams. Til next time Fatburger"}
{"text":"Absolutely best fast food service in VEGAS.  Highly recommended. Every member of the staff was superb."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I've tried these guys more than once.  The hamburger buns fall apart every time and for the price you would think you are getting a gourmet burger.  I'll stick to Five Guys or Smash Burger.  I have never been impressed with Fatburger."}
{"text":"Had to try Fatburger - wasn't disappointed. I got the 1/3 lb with the works and it's a wonder I didn't just drool everywhere. The fries were pretty average but I was very pleased with the burger. Giving 3 stars because the price seemed a bit steep."}
{"text":"OK. I'll admit that in the area that I live, Five Guys is considered the best burger in the area, so when I heard all the hype about this place, I had to give it a try. I'll have to admit that this burger was definitely tasty and unlike the Five Guys burgers, did not fall apart while you are trying to eat it. The fries are almost as good, and you can have a cold adult beverage with your burger. My only negative is the construction that is going on right in front, especially, if you decide to eat outside. The dust and noise is not good. I just wish we had one in North West Florida."}
{"text":"Passed by this place a zillion times without a thought of stopping since I'm a Carl's Jr fan. Finally tried it the other day because my husband wanted to go and I was pleasantly surprised! The burgers are made fresh to order and they are juicy and flavorful. The shakes are made with real ice cream, not the nasty powdered stuff most fast food places use. But they use vanilla ice cream to make a chocolate shake and it wasn't very \"chocolatey\". So the next time I went I asked for extra chocolate syrup and it was a perfect choc shake. The employees are nice and aim to please. Glad I tried Fatburger!"}
{"text":"We stopped while walking the strip and found an average burger with mediocre choices for beers. They appear to have some specials, but we were never told about them."}
{"text":"Our server Mallory was super awesome!! Very attentive and a great personality. She made our stay worthwhile."}
{"text":"Can you say delicious!? Service was good. Food was amazing.  Loved the atmosphere ! Who doesn't ? It's Vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but holy crap is it difficult to order! The lady barely speaks English and kept trying to give us a chocolate shake when we wanted pumpkin. Couldn't figure out how to do no tomato or mayo either. It took 11 minutes to get our food. We pulled over in the parking lot, ate our food, and drove away and the guy in line behind us still hasn't received his order!"}
{"text":"Can you guys update your business hours? went by at 9:30 and it was closed this seems to happen more often then not, get your shit together"}
{"text":"I have to say it is the average Fatburger experience. The staff is friendly and eager to please. This one is not so busy as the other locations around Las Vegas. It has plenty of easy parking. The lot is also easy to get in and out of.

Like other Fatburger locations if your in a hurry I find it better to call ahead or order on-line unless your with someone who's company you enjoy. They don't cook the burgers until they are ordered so the wait can be a monotonous if there is a line of people.

I like my Fatburgers cut in half and my fries well-done."}
{"text":"Good burgers with a nice list of add-ons. Although the price of each add-on is rather punitive. A $8 burger becomes a $12 burger with snap of a finger. Secondly, a previous review mentioned this and it's true-the buns fall apart way too easy!  If you're going put the kitchen sink on a burger then you better have buns to withstand the load."}
{"text":"Good burgers very filling for any appetite bit a little pricey. All in all very worth the meal"}
{"text":"Fatburger has always been better than all the chains including In and Out.  The patties are tasty and ingredients fresh.  Their shakes are also made with real ice cream and taste great!

This location has plenty of parking, a drive-through and is open pretty late."}
{"text":"The best vegetarian burger with onion rings and added jalapeños I have ever tasted in my whole entire eating life!"}
{"text":"Oh you're in Vegas. You will and need to go Fatburger. Regardless if you're a snotty rich person I would still recommend this place! The burgers and fries are great. The price is steep but it's Vegas!! The bar is good and cosy great service. However we stopped by the bar to get a quick drink. 3 vodka and lemonade $80? Oh well that was Nye. That's the only downside!"}
{"text":"This burger was terrible. No one in my family actually liked it. The wings are barely even cooked and the  pootine was gross. Ya the milkshakes are amazing but for a outrageous price of 5$. I am never going back to this place.  
Ps the pice for 3 people that ordered one quarter pounder each and no drinks was over 40$!"}
{"text":"I rarely eat fast food, but me and my dad came here before catching a screening of Rogue One at Sunset Station's theater. It was also my first time eating at Fatburger in literally forever. If you're looking for a good burger and fries to enjoy, I suggest trying this place!"}
{"text":"AVOID this place, first time trying it ... to say the least SUBPAR. The cost of the food is way to much for how mediocre it is, figured be a good burger, but hell no. Customer service was bad, acted as though we were bugging them.

Will NOT do this one again, dont know if I will do ANY Fatburger again. Pricing is not reasonable for what they serve."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty stuff, especially their thick cut fries, yum!  Those are hard to find these days.  This location is in the food court at Green Valley Ranch, just go in the doors by the movie theater/arcade and take the escalator up.  It is a tad smoky for my taste, but it is to be expected since it is inside a casino.  I wish the food court wasn't open to the casino floor, but what can you do.  Weather permitting, I usually get my food to go and eat it outside at the district.  They are pretty pricey, and other several sizes of burgers depending on how hungry you are."}
{"text":"Oh lite night fix. How I love you fatburger, you are always reliable when others are closed. You provide greasy food to prevent my hangover from overtaking me in the morning. Thank goodness they have a veggie burger. Life saver. It's not my favorite veggie burger, that's why they only get 4 stars. But it does take care of the late night drunken cravings. :)"}
{"text":"I love fat burger the burgers are probably the best you can get through a drive through. It's expensive and it takes a while, it totally worth it. If it was a little cheaper I would give them 5 Stars. The staffe needs some work but the quality of the burgers make up for it."}
{"text":"Great place. Burgers are always correct and delicious. The service isn't that good though. My friend brought in his service dog today and we were stared at the entire time and they all looked scared. It's a dog, not a lion. Calm down. Both times I've been here one specific girl always looked annoyed and like she didn't want to be there. Girl, there are so many people looking for jobs, don't take up space if you don't like it there."}
{"text":"The food was amazing like it always is but your host name Tanya with an employee number 86 has a horrible attitude and really upset my wife after having an amazing night at the red rock casino."}
{"text":"Had a really good experience at this particular Fatburger.  Great onion rings!  Yes, it takes 10-ish minutes for your made-to-order food and I paid $13 for everything, so you could say it takes twice as long and costs twice as much as McDonalds -- but its also twice as good IMO."}
{"text":"Love that this place is always open! Buy one get one drinks! Our drink server was really sweet. Has a perfect view of the Las Vegas strip. We went here both nights in vegas. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Yea...we need to eat @ 4am...biotches.....bahhahhaa and now they have a bar....whhooo knew..with fatburger beer!! Whhhat what!!??"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Fatburger in a while, and I remember coming here every now and then when I was younger, so we decided to have brunch here for old time's sake.

First of all, the guy at the drive-thru had no patience. Every time he asked if we wanted something with an order, within 2 seconds of asking his question, he'd rudely say \"HELLO?\" Secondly, I ordered a sweetened tea, but was given an unsweetened one which the lady gladly exchanged. But when I tasted the new sweetened tea, it literally tasted like sugar and water with no tea flavor whatsoever and barely any hint of color. And lastly, I found a few pieces of wilted lettuce in my chicken sandwich.

The burgers and sandwiches aren't anything special. The only good thing about the meal was the Fat Fries. So overall, the meals are not worth the price. Even my drink was terrible. And an entire additional $1 just to add a slice of cheese to your burger or sandwich? Come on."}
{"text":"Came to fat burger for lunch today and the food was ok not to bad but the price was not rite for the food I received!  Staff was great!"}
{"text":"Heaven is a Baby Fat and an order of their awesome steak fries."}
{"text":"Fat burger is amazing! What isn't there to love about this place, big juicy hamburgers, fries. The location of this place is great it's on the strip and it's open all day long, do great for people getting out of the clubs and casinos. Lines can get a lil crazy it is VEGAS. Definitely a place to check out"}
{"text":"Listen I just had a great burger and every time I go to fat burger it's a great burger so do yourself a favor go in there get the burger with an egg on it one of the best burgers in town"}
{"text":"This place was busy! when we came in. Thats usually a good thing, and the line seemed to move pretty quickly. I was entertained with them yelling out the orders as well :) It doesn't take much to entertain me.  

We got our food and I have to say that my favorite part was the fries. They were excellent. The burger its self almost reminded me of a chicago style hot dog because of what was on it. Good, but not amazing.

It was fun to eat in here and just watch all the different people come and go."}
{"text":"This was the slowest place I've ever seen! 25 minutes and 2 people in line. I finally gave up and asked for my money back. The staff has no motivation. Never again! I hope a general manager does something about this slow ass place!"}
{"text":"I think Fatburger has a really good burger. It's a hand-formed patty and it's cooked after you order it. It's hard to find that in fast-food nowadays.

The topping are always good and fresh. I really like that they put both sweet relish AND dill pickles on their burgers. It's unique and it tastes good.

The steak fries are also good. Hard to find at a fast food place nowadays. 

I always make sure to get Fatburger in at least once while I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Alright, fine, Fatburger gets a slight upgrade.

I never end up here on my own accord; I get dragged here by *boys* wanting a Fatburger at midnight. *They* don't have to worry about being accosted by dudes who think they're in a rap video (fyi: fake bling--not so cute.) *They* don't have to worry about their burger being too pink & not being able to eat it. Whine, whine, whine. My sincerest apologies.

I ordered a veggie burger topped with a fried egg & bacon--I've definitely had better, but at least it was edible, unlike my previous experiences here. Burger was overwhelmed by toppings (mustard, mayo, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes.) The steak fries (Fat Fries) were good. 

I'll eat here if I'm forced, but I'm not going to be happy about it *pouts & folds arms over chest*"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in ages. What an awesome burger the bread really put this meal over the top. For a chain FATBURGER is definitely on point."}
{"text":"This place is beyond fucken ridiculous. I just paid $30 for two burgers one drink one fries and one Mille shake!!! Who in the fuck charges this muchZ this place is always dead. This is the first and last time I'm eating here! I can't believe this/ this place isn't even high quality or fancy. It's a fucken hamburger stand. Ridiculous! I hope corporate sees this and makes changes. You guys don't even offer ac in this damn restaurant. It's so hot and stale in here. You have workers who can't even explain their receipts! It's fucken pathetic. I will never ever eat here again. I feel like trashing this place for how expensive it wants to charge for two damn burgers!!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is simple.

Positives: Burgers are very good. Has a lot of flavor. Cooked fresh made to order. Onion rings are very good. Not too much breading like other places. From what I have seen so far, all the Fatburgers that are in the casinos are 24 hours. Fatburger for breakfast? Sure, why not? Milkshakes are genuine. Very smooth and you can taste the ice cream.

Negatives: Pricey. Their smallest burger starts at around 5 dollars going up to 10 for an XXL burger. Their biggest, which is the XXXL burger, will have you forking up some serious coin. These prices are just for the burgers. Of couse you can get all these with fries and drink for an additional charge. You can get fat or sknny fries. So you see a combo meal can get pretty expensive especially if you are feeding a family of 4 or more. They also have turkey burgers. I have ordered it twice. The first time it was overcooked so it  was a bit dry and bland. The second time they didnt cook it thoroughly so it was a bit bloody still. Never again will I order the turkey burger. Those times were drive thru so I was too lazy to drive all the way back to complain and have it redone. 

Service is decent. Of course you gotta wait awhile especially if the place is packed. All their locations have a retro 50's, 60's, 70's rock and soul themes. Some locations even have a jukebox for your listening pleasure. 

So overall, it's a decent place to go to every so often. I just dont recommend the turkey burger."}
{"text":"The order was wrong and we asked for nacho cheese fries and got shredded cheese on our fries. We also waited a long time for our food."}
{"text":"I like fat burger, in fact I'll go as far as to say that for big burger diner experiences, I'd prefer this place than the nearby five guys 1 burger joint.

I believe that in the last 3-4 visits I've had over the years, I never had an issue with the quality of the burgers served. I particularly like their milkshakes and chicken sandwiches as well.

But in terms of the price, wanting something cheaper doesn't justify going to this place. Cheap, fast, burger fixes are best spent at Mickie D's. But Fat Burger is a great alternative if your willing to spend 10-15 dollars"}
{"text":"The Last Great Hamburger Stand -- reads the facade of Fatburger. John Lee Hooker playing on the jukebox, cooks yelling order numbers at unsound decibels . . .  Yeah--I'll bite. 

I went with the Fat Deal (yes--that's what it's called) with onion rings. I was here for lunch and thought my order came out really quick. I was a little worried. My Fat Burger didn't look too fat, but it's all an illusion; it's actually quite a beast. I wasn't sure if I would be able to walk back to my conference when I was done. 

Fatburger is a cheap eat, nicely situated on this South part of the strip. I'm glad to have found it. The interior feels vintage and jukebox is pretty rockin'. I think the place is pretty top notch in terms of fast food. My burger was tasty and as I already mentioned--filling!"}
{"text":"My son loves the vegan burgers here and now he has the option of the impossible burger or the Boca burger. He got the Boca burger but will be back to try the impossible burger. Only.thing is there is always a long wait here. Personally I don't really like the regular burgers here especially for the price so we only go for his vegan burgers when he gets a craving."}
{"text":"the burgers are alot better in the states than they are here, the name says it all, no calorie counting here, get the fat burger loaded with thick fries and a good ol' shake with whip cream to wash it all down, on the strip opened 24 hours, just watch the rowdys late at night or the drunks..every time i go to LV i go this joint, cooked on a flat grill and made to order... no microwaves here.....on a funny note my son is 3 and loves mc D's fries, so i went in the joint right next  door to Fat burger and all the eupopean tourists were in there, i guess they don't know any better...."}
{"text":"My sister got e-coli from this place and so did a family friend on a separate occasion. Be warned. Hopefully they don't delete this comment like they did on Urban Spoon."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the time of night, or maybe we just caught a bad crew or maybe every one else is super drunk when they done here so it's delicious to them, not sure but our food wasn't good in the least bit. My burger was burnt and dried out and so were my two friends. But, if you check in on yelp and show the bartender, you'll get a free shot...which you'll need if your burger is prepared like mine was. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just woooow!! We decided to try this place out....Boy, do we regret it! We should of known better once we entered. The odor of sewer through out this place is ridiculous!! No freakin A/C during summer is INCREDIBLE! But anyways, we still ordered our food... I know it's called Fatburger for a reason but seriously, those burgers were greasy AF'! Over exaggerated greasy.  Not only were they greasy but does it really take 35 minutes to make our food? I mean I understand making it fresh and all but that's pretty ridiculous. Health Department needs to come down here and check this place out. I didn't even finish my burger and fries. I really tried to give y'all a chance...never again will I step a foot in this place. I was completely disgusted."}
{"text":"Craving it as I write. 

We decided to hit up a different burger joint since I was craving a nice, juicy burger! I was tired of In N Out, Red Robin, and the many over trekked joints. You know how it is when you're craving something and at the same time wanting to try something new - RISKY!

We walked in at first and was delighted at the simple menu. The food came out pretty quickly. The burger was as fresh and juicy as I'd craved. The first bite was insanely delightful with the juices melodiously circle in your mouth with the tomato, mustard, grilled onions, etc...and to add to it, the grilled bun added that extra crunch. SO good. 

Maybe we were hungry or maybe, it was just THAT good. We haven't stopped talking about going back. Oh, well, it's Saturday today. Maybe we'll have another Fat Burger snack today!"}
{"text":"We finally decided to check out the famous fat burger! Oreo shake was good..........like really really good.... 

Burgers were pretty good, I tried mine with an egg added. Fries were good, we tried the thick cut fries. 

We didn't spend much time here since we were on a schedule zipping around Vegas! But we will be back to try the thousand island burger... mmmmm"}
{"text":"Fatburger has delicious burgers (my personal favorite is the mushroom Swiss, and my boyfriend loves a XXL), but what makes this location stand out are the people. I love the food, so I'll go to the ones in Texas Station and Red Rock, but when I have the choice, I will always go to Rancho!"}
{"text":"I ordered the smallest turkey burger on the menu add bacon and a fried egg, heavenly. I  couldn't finish my order of onion rings and was totally full. 
The server was very friendly and explained the menu very thoroughly to first time customers. They give Smash Burgers a run for their money.
The only negative would be the slightly high price."}
{"text":"Whenever I want to drop some some money on fast food & go in I drive out of my way to this location!!! The food is always on point there are2 other locations I could go to but I always go here! Keep up the good work  fat-burger team on N Rancho"}
{"text":"Great burger but service was not as good as it had been last visit. I had a double burger and a shake and although tasty and filling. The girl working was more interested in flirting with her co workers than helping me. Slapping her coworker and saying \"you so silly boy\" made me wonder where the manager was. Anyway I would still go back its not like I was at Wolfgang pucks you know and it was like 2am in Vegas...."}
{"text":"Fatburger gets hyped up a lot, so I decided to try it out for myself.  Fatburger is located in a nice and classy looking strip mall.  The servers were very friendly and greets you with big smiles and enthusiasm.  I'm not a burger fan, but based on all the hype surrounding fatburger, I had high hopes.  Well, to put it bluntly, those hopes were not met.  The burger was tasteless.  There wasn't even any ketchup on the burger.  Nothing separates this burger from any other burger, in fact, it was quite bland.  At least the big mac has the big mac sauce, hero burger has the hero sauce, Wendy's has the baconator and Harvey's has a grilled taste.  Well, this burger offered nothing to keep it in my memory.  Even the accompaniments weren't memorable, I can't even say that the onions or tomato were super fresh, which, I can actually say for a burger I once had at Burger King!  Anyway, my review of fatburger may be harsh, but this review is based on a comparison of other burgers I've tasted.  I must say though, fatburger has awesome shakes and poutine!!!  This definitely saves them and I would go back for the shakes and poutine.  The three stars is an average score and is based on the amalgamated review of the great shakes and poutine and the non-memorable and overpriced burger."}
{"text":"This fed the kid but I am not a fan I don't eat meat and had no interest in a turkey one. I notice the burgers got smaller. The kid mostly ate the fries. This place gets crowed and the workers are very speedy."}
{"text":"It's impossible to end a night (or morning) in Vegas without stopping by Fatburger! 

You can order burgers with veggie, turkey, beef, size S to XXXL.  I've seen my friends devour the XXXL and it's doable, but not recommended.  I swear they almost had heart attacks from all that meat.  

Whatever you do, follow these tips:

1) Order your burger with an egg!  
2) Order the skinny fries
3) Order the chili
4) Dip the skinny fries in the chili
5) Watch the drunk, cracked out patrons make fools of themselves while they dance to the jukebox music or attempt to eat their food.  Best Las Vegas entertainment outside of Cirque du Soleil or the strip clubs.  Trust."}
{"text":"I like a good old fashion burger.  You can either use their website to submit your order or call ahead if you are short on time.  They actually make the WHOLE burger AFTER you order it.  THEY DON\"T keep a a little bin full of precooked patties, steaming over boiling hot water all day to drop inside your burger like some other places.  I bounce between the Med & LG burgers and hold the relish.  Pickles & relish together is just too much for me.   But they always make the burger the way you want.  extra cheese is a little high (.69).   But if you've come this far sometimes you gotta go for the gold with a shake and onion rings and fries.   Make sure you bring a friend or a date to help finish everything.  And don't forget to tip.  They always yell \"Fat Tip!\""}
{"text":"So I love Fatburger every now and then. Decided to get some today. I tried to get one at the Fort Apache and Flamingo location but their computer was down and the AC was out. So I figured ok the Flamingo and Rainbow location is not too far. Well oddly enough their AC was out too. When I had mentioned that they had the same issue as the other store, I was told both locations are the same owner. So that tells me that the AC is not working on because the owner is trying to save money. Really????."}
{"text":"The Fries of all shapes and sizes here are on the money. I parked behind this place for like $5 or something; some sketch guy is like:
\"give me five bucks, and you can leave it here all day!\"
\"Is it safe back here in this rando' parking lot?\"
\"Yeah, dude. Here, put this raffle ticket in your window. You'll be good all day.\"
I left about $4k worth of personal items in the truck, and then stumbled into this Fatburger on the strip. 

First time I've ever had it, and I could eat this every day if necessary. Not world-class food, or life changing by no means. But me and my fiancé split an original burger and fries, and it was enough to get us up and down the strip for the afternoon for around $8. I suggest splitting it, because it's a lot of food - hence, Fatburger. And honestly, you're in Vegas; if you don't understand that great food is easily found everywhere, you're missing a huge part of what makes that place even bearable. Honestly, eat the Fatburger for fuel, in order to get you to some true greatness down the street.

The place seemed clean, and honestly, we had lunch there for two days. I don't mind it, but on the cheap, it can be had quick. Try a shake too, if that's your thing, because they looked great. Avoid it a little after hours though, cause it can get gamey with the drunkards and sorted riff raff."}
{"text":"Decided to grab some grub before checking out a movie. There's a few selections here that fall into the fast food category. We chose fatburger because their line was the longest so we figured that was a good sign. ( ha guy logic)

After our order was taken we waited a bit to receive our meal. By a bit I'm talking 20 minutes. That's long for fast food standards but I must admit the presentation was worth the wait. A mountain of food was shoved in front of us...minus my chili cheese fries.

My only real complaint is the inflated prices. I know these places inside of casinos have to survive but man they jack the prices up something fierce."}
{"text":"Headline: They have 4 burger sizes. Mine, the \"XL,\" was a half-pound wonder that pales in comparison to its bigger brothers--the XXL and XXXL. 

Tasty seared burgers with crisp edges. Extra-wide buns. Topped to your liking. 

WARNING: Don't go here thinking that you'll save some money on your Vegas dining budget by \"just grabbing a burger\" for dinner. A half-pound cheeseburger, fries, and soft drink totaled $19 BEFORE tip."}
{"text":"Look at my photos, my burger was so dry, overlooked and gross, one of the worst burgers I have ever had. 
The sweet potato and curly fries was good."}
{"text":"Most locations are fairly good. 
This one screwed up 2 out of 3 orders .
Food was slipped together without any care or attention. Customer service was pathetic. 
I like Fatburger , but I'll never come to this location again."}
{"text":"This location is inside the Red Rock Casino food court, near the movie theater. The staff was friendly and they made your burger to order. They cam pretty close on the beef.

You can get a very large burger with lots of toppings on it. My favorite is the fried egg, although my egg was bit undercooked which made it runny, resulting in quite a messy burger. I can't imagine trying to eat one of these burgers with chili on it as well. The seasoning on the burger was bit unusual but I really liked it. I think other locations of Fatburger do a better job. This one is just a food court version. 

A vegetarian \"burger,\" a chicken sandwich and a turkey burger are also available if you want something a little lighter. The skinny fries are pretty tasty as well. Good eatin.

If you are staying at the hotel you cannot charge your food to your room which is a little annoying."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and just get blown away at the great service we seem to get every time.  The burgers are amazing and the fact that their grilled makes them perfect in my book.  The fries are great as well.  This place Is a restaurant I would recommend to anyone including kids."}
{"text":"Some good grease when your wacked!!!  Always good and late nite is the best time to chow!!!"}
{"text":"I finally made it out to Fatburger after years of listening to Ice T - \"it was a good day\" and its reference (possible endorsement).  I took my 4 year old son with me.  I got a Fatburger, fries and diet coke (I wanted to cut some calories - ha ha ha!).  My son got a kids meal that came with a small burger, small fries and small drink.  The food was really tasty, but too filling.  The two of us rolled out of the place.  I am not a light weight either.  

It is decent fast food, a cut or two above McD's, BK, Arby's, etc.

No ambiance, but good eatin'

The food is greasy and has enough calories to last you for the day.

I fun place to eat with the real feel an LA fast food joint.

Don't miss."}
{"text":"It's a good burger. I decided I wanted the fried egg on it after I'd already ordered and it was too late to add it. They were nice about (charging me for and) making me an egg all by itself so I could put it on the burger myself.

Yes, I am eating that burger in my picture, whoa!"}
{"text":"People seem to hate on Fatburger especially when in comparison to In-N-Out.  I love both !!  I know that Fatbuger is a bit more pricey, but I'm a fan.

February 2, 2011

Intended on playing Bingo.  I arrived late and ended up eating Fatburger and gambling.  

Ordered:
Skinny Fries (Well-Done)
Fat Burger (no onions and relish)

PROS:
* convenient location located inside casino near movie theaters
* clean eating area
* they got my order right!  
* Unsweetened Green Tea and Black Tea!
*Chili fries and you can add an egg to your burger!

CONS:
* Wouldn't accept my BOGO coupon. Cashier didn't know how to enter it.

TIPS:
* Skinny fries taste incredible Well Done and extra Crispy !

This place would have gotten a 4 star if my coupon was accepted.  The only reason he didn't accept it was because he didn't know how to enter into the system.  I figured call a manager and off I go, but I guess that didn't cross his mind.  It's all good.  I still have the coupon and will use it next time I go to a Fatburger.  This is your typical Fast Food burger joint.  Just a bit more pricey.  Super Good though. I recommend you try Fatburger if you haven't already done so."}
{"text":"Just average I would say, a bit pricey drinks are nothing special. The burger was big and portions sizes fine."}
{"text":"Good place to go to after a night of partying.  Fast, yummy and perfect to eat when you don't want to feel like shit the next morning.  It's just a good and cheap alternative to the other places that vegas has."}
{"text":"It is the place I go for burgers.  Fatburgers.  The shakes and fries simply tidy the meal up in my opinion.  :)"}
{"text":"I gave a bad feed back because the dinning are and tables are always dirty. Salt and pepper shaker and discusting all covered with black gums till the new management took over. Guess what not a thing changed and didn't take long same disgusting place to eat. The cooking are you can see over the counter is dirty as it can get. You will run out of you see it. Just walk up to cooking area and see it through glass....Never again..!!! Move along to better and cleaner place to eat. In & out is your better choice and not too far."}
{"text":"Good, overpriced burger joint on Nellis and Vegas Valley. This is not a $ IMHO; it should be $$ since you are paying near $10/burger. It's not a good neighborhood so get your burger to go. Get you drinks at the McDonald's across the street since they're going for $1 these days...

My bottom line? If taste means that much and you cannot possibly go 1 extra  mile north up Nellis to get to an equally flavorful contender at In-N-Out, then knock yourself out spending that discretionary gas money on a Fatburger special. Otherwise, move on down the road in either direction (In-N-Out to the north, Original Tommy's to the south) and get a competitive burger with gas money in tact. The true rating for me on this is actually 2.4 stars for demerits re: location, price and not compensating for surrounding competition..."}
{"text":"The food's great, I like it here. My only concern is that they're really really expensive."}
{"text":"Food is not bad but don't try to go into the restrooms and wash ur hands it's absolutely disgusting! Other than that everything thing else is average."}
{"text":"The food quality is decent and consistent.   The restaurant is always clean and the staff polite and quick.

I appreciate the choice of opting out of the garnishes and have never left the restaurant hungry.

But the I really miss the enthusiastic echoing of shouting out the orders of the other location and the first few months this location was open.

The staff are competent and quiet.  What attracted me to Fatburger originally was the enthusiasm of the staff for their food prep and customers.

This is my husband's favourite burger joint, so we go there a lot.  And he compares everywhere else to Fat Burger.

If Hubby was a Yelpin' fella, he'd give it a solid four stars.   And since we like to keep him happy, we go to Fatburger but make him expand his horizons by trying new Yelp-bits  a couple of times a month."}
{"text":"24 hour burgers on the strip.  This was my first Fatburger experience and I got to say that they have a good thing going.  I would put them above most fast food spots, but I don't think they top in n out.  I love the fact that you can get steak fries (the best choice), but the regular fries are better than average as well.  Generally you have to decide how much meat you want and that will determine the cost and size of your burger (they also have some other meat choices as well).  They have other toppings too, which actually makes their burgers somewhat customizable.  I seem to remember even getting asked what type of cheese I wanted?!?!? Bring on the cheese choice revolution.
I found the prices reasonable for LV strip, and the wait (at 1:00p on a weekday) was about 25 minutes.  Don't expect a seat though, as the dining area was pretty crowded the whole time I was there and it almost certainly is worse at night.
I didn't find the staff to be *fun* like other reviewers did, but they were certainly doing their job and that is all I really ask of anybody.
I imagine if you show up at night you need to be prepared for a totally different scene that is less focused on the food and more on finding something to soak up all that margarita by the yard or random neon colored alcohol beverage.  I may visit at night just to see what the spectacle looks (and also 24 hours, relatively quick is better than almost every other option out there)"}
{"text":"Came here last night and I must say that i was really impressed.  I got  a large burger, and it didn't disappoint.  Good size and tasty.  They need to put one in San Jose instead of all that crappy in n out."}
{"text":"One of the best, down home, non-fancy burgers I've had in the U.S.!  The only one I can think of which beats FB's burger is The Shack Stack at Shake Shack (NYC).

But FB is a must stop place if you're akin to we folk who can look past the super grody conditions of the \"dining\" area and dig into this fatty, greasy, unhealthy, heart-stopping piece of perfection which is otherwise known as the Heaven-sent accompaniment to the twelve drinks you just slammed over the past two hours ;-)"}
{"text":"This Fatburger is great. The staff has a heart of gold, a spine of steel. My date and I arrived 20 mins before close on a Thursday (today). There were 2 gentlemen closing and they were taking the order of a large, violent, belligerently drunk group of people.  The people were rude and disrespectful and started cussing at the employees simply because they were too inebriated to communicate. The employees handled it very calmly with complete professionalism, and made my date and I feel very welcome despite the fact that that big group of people started getting violent towards me and my date. The two employees handled themselves very well! They deserve a raise! Thank you BK and Your collegue for excellent service despite anything."}
{"text":"Very amazing service and excellent customer service!! I got along with all the workers right off the bat! Will come back here over any other place"}
{"text":"When I want fast food in Las Vegas, that actually tastes good, I go to Fat Burger. DUH! 

Vege burger, fat fries and a milkshake.

This isn't the best Fat Burger I've been too, but its the only one I know of in this crazy dirty town. 

Its affordable and worth it.

Gets kinda busy, so better to take it back to your hotel room, or find a nice bench to either people watch or city light watch.

Such a great location on the strip, smack dab in the middle of the \"Strip.\""}
{"text":"I bookmarked this to review, but honestly can't remember the experience too well, so it was 'A-OK'. I think the burger was good, and the fries, but I've had better!"}
{"text":"The food is not good. The cleanliness and friendliness of the staff is also very not good. On top of it all, it is very expensive. Two burgers and two fries were almost $30. Will NOT be back and don't recommend unless staff isn't so rude and food is served with quality ingredients!"}
{"text":"Relieved the food wasn't as bad as our service. Repeated the order twice and twice they confirmed and they still got the order wrong with everything that was ordered."}
{"text":"Fuller stocked bar! Oh, and there is a groupon available for this location!! Yeah, this is our first stop in Vegas EVERY TIME! This Fat Burger has yummy food and a gorgeous outside seating area, plus the staff is super friendly and welcoming. As long as there is a groupon, you'll see us there!"}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas last week and went to Fatburger 2 separate times.  On the 1st visit we had a burger and fries. While both were good, they really were nothing special. If anything the meat was slightly on the dry side.
On our last morning is Vegas we went for breakfast. I had eggs potatoes and toast.  The eggs were very much undercooked, barely enough to not turn them back in.
Potatoes were very good."}
{"text":"Great food, service and classic music. I come here ask the time when visiting my mom!"}
{"text":"The service by the blonde guy is amazing as he is always so nice and always remember what I order.  As for the burgers they suck.!!! They have changed something in the last couple months with the meat and buns.  Not fresh!!!  As for the owner!!!  Also, I am not a fan of the owner.  He stands over his workers and micro manages them which I can't stand.  I know longer go there as a guy like that doesn't deserve to manage people."}
{"text":"I love this place. You know why???  Because I love burgers.  You know why else???  Because you can throw in a fried egg in your burger.  People often think it's weird, but you can't knock it till you try it.  So try it.

The menu here is very simple with 6 burgers to choose from.  You got the 1/2 pound Kingburger to the Veggie Burger and 4 other options in between.  After choosing the burger of choice, you have your add-ons.  This includes bacon, an egg, chili, and cheese.  I like to add-on bacon, egg, and cheese.  I leave the chili for a different style of burger, where I'd add on chili and cheese.  As for the sides, I prefer skinny fries as opposed to fat fries (more crunchy and less starchy).  For the shakes, they have 3.  The basic chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.  Choose whatever you feel like for that day... that's pretty much what I do.  Same goes for the soda.  

But yeah, focus on the burger and enjoy."}
{"text":"Food?  Top notch. Service? A lot to be desired.  I came here around 8pm on a Tuesday night and there was nary a soul to be found except for the two guys working behind the counter.  Like really, not a single customer in the entire restaurant.  
The guy taking our order seemed like we were putting him out and acted annoyed that egads!  actual customers had walked into the restaurant and shocking! wanted to eat.  He was so incredibly non-friendly that it was uncomfortable.  My husband (bless his heart *eyeroll*) has a knack for taking a long time to order.  This guy was not having it.  As my husband was checking out the menu, this dude had the nerve to ask not once, but twice, \"Are you ready?\"  I mean - I could understand if they were busy and other people were waiting but like I said, we were the ONLY customers there.  Obviously if we're still looking over the menu, we aint ready, Poindexter.
If you can overlook Mr. Personality behind the counter and just come for the food, you're in luck.  The cheeseburgers are classically good.  Quality meat cooked perfectly, tasty cheese, fresh buns and ALL the condiments you might want.  (In fact, while we're on the condiments, if you're not a pickle lover, beware that they put pickles AND relish on their burgers so it might be overkill).  The steak fries might be my favorite part of Fatburger.  They're fat and golden and hot and perfect.  The onion rings are my second favorite thing.  The breading is just the right amount and so you get a good onion flavor plus they're not overly greasy.  
The place was clean (as it should be with no customers in sight) and other than the less than enthusiastic employees there (I mean - I yelled \"Thank you!\" to them as we were walking out and didn't hear a peep back.  WTH?), Fatburger is on my radar for good.  It's one of the last real hamburger joints."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying, DANNNNGGGG.  Woohoo! As good as it gets says it all.  I consider myself a foodie.  Professional buffet basher if you will.  This place blew me away.  If you have ever been to steak n shake its like that but 10 times better.  They are huge juicy burgers with a crispyness on the outside cause they smash em.  Its hard to say without a doubt best burger ever with the amount of burgers Ive eatn, but when someone asks me it will always be mentioned.  Atmosphere is cool, fries are great, I even thought the pop was extra tasteful.  They serve booze but I dont like drinkn when Im eatn for those who do that.  Every time I go to vegas I will most definatly be going there atleast once"}
{"text":"Fatburger is the best.  I'm sorry.  I would choose Fatburger over In 'n' Out any day.  I've read your reviews.  And yeah, it's expensive.  But this is Vegas, nothing comes cheap in Sin City.  If they had an In 'n' Out here, it would be pricier.  Either way, the burgers here are simply gorge-yourself-delicious.  Yes, you can kill yourself with the Fatburger with a fried egg on it.  And bacon!  But that's the beauty, yeah!  Order that with the chili cheese steak fries!

Look, the place is called FATburger.  You're not coming here for  your health.  You're coming here for the Fat.  And on he side, you get a mean ass burger."}
{"text":"Can't say too much about the burgers... a bit over priced, I've def. had better burgers. The grease was, literally, dripping from the burger. The fries were tasteless, the buns were a bit stale. I'd rather go across the street to In-n-Out, drive 7 miles to Joe's Farm Grill or even better, drive to Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe."}
{"text":"UGHHHHHHHH!  Why did I come here when I could have gone to in-n-out?  NEVER AGAIN!

We ordered 6 burgers and everybody added extra things such as eggs, cheese, bacon etc (all for 99 cents each!) on their burger.  We waited for what seem like ages.  Walked our drunk butts back to the hotel ready to get our grub on...

Guess what?  We all didn't have any of the extras included in our burgers.  Not only that meat was dry with no sort of flavor at all.  Even though I was starving I only managed a couple bites before giving up.  What a waste!! The price of my burger was $4.99, for that much I could have gotten a #2 animal style at in-n-out."}
{"text":"Definitely a delicious stop on the way back to our hotel from gambling at MGM. Nice greasy burger and onion rings. Perfect when you're drunk. Stop here if you're in the area. It's nice that they have cooling sprinkler things too"}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious but the waitresses are horrible! They put on sun glasses and so jerk !!!"}
{"text":"Compared to other burgers this place falls way short, sadly i was disappointed! It's just a greasy pile of mess. If you want a burger that has great flavor and the toppings feel fresh then try on the other choices on Mill. The fries had very little seasoning and were just not appetizing compared to other joints. Honestly i wanted to give the place 1 star but felt that was too low and i like to reserve those for places with really bad food and really bad service. The service was good here they greeted you as you walked in and left."}
{"text":"Very small burger joint, but ample parking and great customer service. I had a groupon and ordered a chicken burger with fries and lemonade, and my boyfriend ordered a regular burger in a lettuce wrap with fries and lemonade as well. While it wasn't the most delicious food I've ever had, the portions were generous for the price (especially with a groupon too) and the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"I'd love to give them a great review but their website said they're open until 1:30 a.m. I went at 1:15 a.m. & they were closed. They probably should update their website."}
{"text":"Great burgers! I absolutely loved 'em....I would say the best burger in town....totally recommended"}
{"text":"Nice lady working there waiting for a person arrival that needs to start her shift so she can leave had a swell chat. Now lets taste this late night second dinner it was great the bun and the beef were cooked to perfection for the quality of a late night dinner would come back"}
{"text":"It was an ok burger. The restaurant was not very clean.  Went there with 3 other people and they got 2 of our orders wrong. I'm giving it 3 stars because it was ok food and they got my order correct"}
{"text":"After a wild drink filled night at MGM we decided to ditch the super high bs inside the hotel and hit the strip in search of some low cost, tasty grub. We stumbled into fat burgers around 330 in the morning wobbling from painful stilettos and laughing signing BIGs famous fat burger line \" If I wanna sport her take her to fat burger\" While there I order the turkey burger melt with cheddar cheese w/ fat fries, mixed my drink with lemonade & fruit punch!!! Complete BURGER BLISS... End of story"}
{"text":"This is the best place for burgers and chicken sandwich. Chili cheese fries were good also nice and crispy. Service was great they were nice and full of energy. Will be back."}
{"text":"I'm a former employee here, I quit to work at the District Attorney's office so there's no hurt feelings & my review is as honest as it gets. It's disgusting especially if Marisol makes your burger. She under cooks it the patty & never wears gloves. She touches everything with her bare hands & she never washes her hands. She will blow her nose & put the toppings on your burger directly after with her bare hands. Her customer service skills are non existent. She has A LOT of complaints with corporate, complaints with the owner (Peter), & to the main shift leader Ashley. Why does she still works there is beyond me. She has made many customers loose their appetite & walk out. She also take chunks of meat off of your burger & will eat it, & I mean shove the whole thing in her mouth & chew with her mouth open & stuff just falls out of it. She has worked there for 13-14 years & still is horrible at what she does. She is constantly touching her hair, boobs, face, nose & mouth. The burger might look & taste fine but trust me. It's gross. Jose & Raul are great. They will make your burger like they are making it for themselves. & their customer service skills are phenomenal. They clean as much as they possibly can between taking orders, cooking orders, & bringing customers their food. Ashley the shift manager is the best, she trained me & taught me everything I needed to know. She's great with customers, cleaning, & cooking. Everything is pretty sanitary except for the cockroaches that make it in because Peter is cheap & doesn't want to pay to get the premises sprayed. So basically, if Marisol isn't there you're in the clear. If she is?? I'd recommend coming at a different time."}
{"text":"Completely overpriced and so disappointing!!

I tried their veggie burger for the first and last time yesterday. I would definitely not go here again. I paid $8.50 (with tax)  just for the veggie burger alone. Pretty astronomical price for a fast food joint, especially considering other better tasting veggie burgers (e.g. Hero Burger) are $2 less. The bun was fresh but doughy and the biggest part of the burger. The patty was salty and extremely thin (think of an iPhone and then halve it). The toppings very ho-hum (your basic lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, pickles, relish, ketchup and mustard). Really disappointed that for this price that they don't offer anything beyond these very standard toppings.    

I  didn't like the fact that they don't put the toppings on in front of you so that you can personalize it (e.g. more/less of some toppings).  When you order, there is a list of about 7 very standard toppings on a  card beside the cash and you let them know  if you want all or some of the toppings. Then you can't see as they're making it and they hand the finished product to you. My burger had way too much lettuce (a huge thick piece) and almost no ketchup or mustard. 

Without a doubt one of the worst and most overpriced veggie burgers I've ever had. They seem to have spent all their money on making the place look flashy rather than the food. No surprise that I was initially the only one in there. Save your money and head to Hero Burger."}
{"text":"Should be one and a half stars . Very dry burger not so good and our skinny frys were stale tasted old. People who work here can't understand English.asked if it was process cheese or cheddar she couldn't understand then the lady who brought our food we asked for some type of sauce any sauce or burger was so dry she brought us salt asked her again never seen her again. We won't be back in an out is 100 times better and a quarter of the price. I will say it was clean"}
{"text":"The last time I went to this Fat Burger was not a favorable experience. I decided to give them another shot which was a HUGE mistake. First the place smelled really bad when I went inside... I should have walked out then!! Never did get my order as I waited 10 minutes which is normally not a big deal. However, when I went to inquiry the person at the register was incredibly rude and said they did not know when my order would be ready. At that point I walked out.. would rather lose out on my $14 than put up with that behavior.
Oh did I mention it was a little after 1:00 pm and there was one other couple in the entire dining area. I think that says something. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Place seems new and chique...  But burgers were dry and tasteless.  Nothing special.

Interesting toppings and the service is good, but I just don't see the difference between this place and other burger places....   Perhaps my burger was overdone."}
{"text":"Blah!!! For $12 for a cheese burger, fries and drink I better get some yum! Especially when the buffet was $14.99. First and last visit to fat burger. No bueno! Go to panda express next door or the GVR cafe for a better value."}
{"text":"Great service. There was a big party ahead of us during a slow time. They worked extra quick to get it out and offered an apology. The food was great, as always."}
{"text":"Here's my disclaimer: I won an Instagram contest that paid for the majority of my food. I paid for upgrades to my prize; upgrades that cost me just over $12. 

Between the three of us, we split an original fatburger (1/3 lb burger), a mushroom swiss burger, a lumberjack poutine with gravy, cheese curds, maple bacon, and grilled onions, a New Yorker poutine with gravy, cheese curds, and pastrami (I think that's about it, although I may be wrong), and two Canada Dry's. While I was not completely full at the end of my meal, the food was sitting fairly heavily in my stomach, so I didn't actually need more food.

What I greatly appreciate is that on any of their burgers, I can add grilled onions AND onion rings (like the breaded ones) on for free! I can't think of any other burger places that do that. I also really liked that the special sauce actually had a kick. I can't even begin to count how many places say they have a spicy sauce that isn't spicy. The mushroom Swiss burger had a fairly good amount of mushrooms on it, so they have that going for them, and both the burgers were quite juicy. Given that they use fresh, never frozen Alberta Angus beef, I'd say that makes sense. Quality-wise, they're pretty good burgers. Here's the thing though. They're tall burgers, but they're really not that big. I wish they were a little bigger circumference-wise and a little less tall. They'd be a lot easier to eat.

On to the poutines. They have these trays they put their burgers and fries on. With a name like Fatburger and with the prices on those poutines, I was expecting a much larger portion of poutine. I have no idea whether this is because my meal was served like a combo and so the poutines were smaller, or whether the poutines are always this small. I'd say there were perhaps a little more fries in the poutine than a typical McDonald's small fries. Lots of gravy and loads of cheese curds though. Super generous with the curds. I prefered the New Yorker cuz pastrami. The pieces of meat could have been cut smaller though. That way, I can have a piece with each bite, instead of eating all the meat off the top before I can reach my fries. Curds weren't squeaky, which I liked, and they were melty enough to give me lots of stringy cheese action. The lumberjack could have done with a little more maple emphasis. Both poutines were on the salty side, especially at the end. Still, POUTINE!

Service was very impressive, especially as this is a fast-food kinda deal. They gave us a number after we ordered at the counter, and delivered our food to us. We were sitting in their table area at the back of the restaurant. It was wonderfully private. The only other table who had been there left soon after we began taking pictures. Before we had finished taking pictures, someone was already there to check and see how we were doing. When we were a few bites in, someone else came and asked if we wanted free drink refills. When we were about to leave, someone was there to help us dispose of our garbage, when we were fully prepared to do so ourselves. Great stuff and thank you!

All in all, because I didn't have to pay for most of my meal, it was quite nice. However, I'm giving this a three-star rating because if I had paid the full price for my meal, I'd be disappointed in what I got in terms of food:value ratio."}
{"text":"This place was okay. Never been to a Fatburger before, but we were looking for a quick, cheap dinner our first night in Vegas and this was right by the hotel.  Food is basic, simple (burgers, fries, milkshakes or cocktails) and did the trick. Service was okay. Waitresses in skimpy outfits that looked kinda bored (can't blame them, 7:30pm on a Thursday) but they were at least friendly. Seating outside was the highlight; people watching was the best--right on the strip!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but really good things to say about this establishment. 

Walked in today after leaving Trader Joe's. Ordered me and my cousin the small meal deal with a Cheeseburger with everything including a fried egg and I got skinny fries while my cuzzo got the fat ones. 

Everything was cooked up fresh and fast and came to our table pronto, piping hot! 

I grew up in L.A. frequenting the Original Fatburgers. I remember the late night street races from Midnight til O'dark thirty in the morning. This place brought back some really nice memories. 

Thumbs Up! 

Only the best get a second visit so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This damn place is overpriced for the greasy ass ....hard ass burger they give. I ordered a large burger with bacon and cheese. I had to pay a dollar extra for bacon and a dollar extra for cheese. That brought the burger to 13 dollars. I told them to hold the relish and mustard. They put a whole lot of other stuff on that issh. Relish, onions , tomatoes, lettuce, mayo, pickles etc. When I bit into the burger all the \"stuff\" rolled in out. The burger was very crunchy shuck I'm not really a fan of crunch burgers. Overall the burger was flavorful but overpriced. Soda 3.19, all that damn money I didn't get fries. Can't wait to get my ass home to go to Wendy's and get a delicious 4for $4"}
{"text":"My friend and I had practically zero sleep and decided to grab breakfast. Since I was visiting the area, I got to choose, and I chose Fatburger. This place is SO ghetto, which is funny as all hell since it's next door to the MGM Grand. In classic Vegas style, this location has a nifty neon sign, and is open 24 hours.

When we walked in, I couldn't help but snap shots of the interior. A gaggle of transvestites were carrying on and one noticed me, thinking I was trying to photograph them. I assured her/him I was really taking photos of the establishment.

I shared a turkey burger ($5) with my friend which wasn't bad, to start. I took a bite, chewed thoughtfully, took a few notes, then proceeded to douse mine in Tabasco. It's no In-N-Out, but it'll feed you. (I heard that I should get one of their specials, and top it off with a fried egg... next time!)"}
{"text":"Never again would I dine at this location.  Employee that waited on us was so hyper, he could not focus.  Gave us the completely incorrect change, no doubt his drawer will be short.  Food took too long, 1 burger had so much salt, it was hard to eat!  Order of onion rings arrived 10 minutes after food, and were under cooked.  Noticed several exchanges of items (drugs?) from employee and a questionable customer. Customer even went behind counter to leave something.  This place was just weird and creepy.  Wrong condiments on burgers. Steer clear of this location, owner should be more aware of what is happening!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom!  I really enjoyed my first Fatburger experience over the weekend - I'll be back for more!  For dine-in, the service is fast and not overly hectic with screaming kids a la McDonald's.

I highly recommend the Turkey Burger - with cranberry sauce, it's like Thanksgiving without needing a long nap afterwards!"}
{"text":"Went to eat there Thursday night and had a miss communication about our bill. We ate 5 burgers and were charged for ten. They claimed one of us went up to the bar and ordered 5 more burgers and fries (it was actually another table who went to the bar and threw 5 more burgers on our tab) I've worked in the restaurant business my entire life and have never seen anyone pay twice the amount that they ate. I would have never payed this bill obviously but the security and bartenders bullied me into paying the entire 166 dollar bill. They threatened me to the point I had to pay the bill or I was gonna get beaten up. I feared for my own well being which is insane to me because all we wanted to do was get some food before bed. These are all facts I would never advise ANYONE to eat at this establishment"}
{"text":"Well I guess I should have read all the reviews before choosing this place. Took forever for the cashier to take my order and even after repeating it several times the order was still not correct. When I went to get it corrected the new person behind the register assured me it would be corrected. When I picked it up it was wrong.  When I asked for it to be corrected they argued with me.... I don't care how good the hamburgers are the service absolutely sucks!"}
{"text":"Took a while for the server to get to us.  Seemed a little unorganized.  The medium burger 1/3 lb is quite small. Go the next size up 1/2 pound.  Burger was good I had to try since ice cube rapped about it in 1994. I think in and out is a lot better but it is definitely worth trying so you can say 3am and just got to fat burger. . Good burger."}
{"text":"I love groupons and deal vouchers. It's a great way of trying a place out and not feeling bad about having wasted your money if you don't like the food. Using a groupon I got two cheddar fatburgers and two small fries for $13. You get to pick from your choice of lettuce, tomato, mustard, relish, onion, pickles, and mayo for your toppings.
As chains go, this is one of the better ones for hamburgers. At first glance it was hard to tell there was a burger in there because of the way the burger is served. They make sort of an open envelope around the burger so that you can just pick it up and eat. The burger is nice and juicy and the bun was fresh. I also enjoyed the fries. They are some of the best fries among the fast food chains. The fries were crisp on the outside. There is no salt added but there is seasoning and hot sauces at the table. They have bottles of Frank's Hot sauce and Chipotle Tabasco Sauce"}
{"text":"The service the night before was incredible, very friendly and fast, this morning the supervisor on duty was rude and disrespectful never going to this location again."}
{"text":"Way over rated. The beef was salty. The chili cheese fries are 90% fries 5% cheese & 5% chili.  I think for what these cost the chili should be more generous portions. 
Won't go back. Been to another location in Buena Park & it was a bit better."}
{"text":"Very very very slow. Did I mention it was slow?

No one in line and it took about 15 minutes to get a burger that was so so."}
{"text":"Good burgers and good chili fries, albeit everything at Fatburger is quite on the expensive side for fast food.

This Fatburger is located in the food court area inside of Wild Horse Pass Hotel & Casino, so it's convenient if you're staying in the hotel and need to satisfy a late night burger craving.

Service was okay but the employees could have been friendlier."}
{"text":"Not busy at all but still took forever to take our order. Dirty but instead of cleaning they were painting the floors right under the customers feet. Also the water fountain doesn't work. All around bad experience and that's coming from someone who loved Fat Burger."}
{"text":"Not my first visit but perhaps my memories fail me!  Not impressed but not terrible either.  They are no match for Lobby's and Giant Hamburger, but I'd give them 3rd place.  Had a crispy chicken sandwich, pretty tasty, a medium burger with cheese and bacon, curly fries, OK and great onion rings.  I requested no mustard on my burger but it was there anyway.  The fixins tended to overpower the burger.  I doubt I'll return with those other two places available."}
{"text":"I live close by, but don't dine here nearly as often as I would like.

What I truly love about this place, is their fantastic French Fries, because they are the huge STEAK FRIES that you never find in conventional \"fast food\" establishments.  That sets them apart from others in the restaurant industry, for sure.

Whenever I have a craving for terrific thick and juicy fries, this is where I go, to load up on several orders.

The employees are friendly, and make you feel very welcome!"}
{"text":"This was a fun outing our first night out in Vegas.  Great prices on beers and burgers.  A great place for a fun night with friends.  Service was friendly and the ambiance is fun and relaxed.  Highly recommended for an informal night out!"}
{"text":"Burgers taste good but not great. For a $10 burger it definitely does not compare to other expensive burger places out there. I used the groupon deal though so that brought the price to a reasonable amount. I dont know how much fountain drinks were but I remember I ordered 2 with my order and it added on $7-8, I never really thought about it till after I paid. 
One thing I did like about this place is that they bring your order to your table."}
{"text":"This is a fast food burger joint.  Not as fast as McDonald's.  On the other hand, they are so much better it's not even a contest.  For what it is, this place is probably the best I've had.  This is NOT the Cordon Bleu, and I'm writing this opinion with that in mind!

Their burgers are prepared fresh (no heat lamps!), and they taste fresh.  Even if you get a McD burger hot off the griddle it tastes like something that wouldn't spoil if you let it sit out for a year.  Fatburger's burgers are hot, tasty, and seem very fresh.  Made with real ground beef (it even crumbles a bit as ground beef is prone to doing...don't ever remember McD's doing that).

The curly fries are really nice.  A light crunch, very tasty.  Also fresh and hot.  And the shakes are pretty good too.  Not the best shakes, but pretty good.

The ambiance is supposed to be sort of 50's diner.  Complete with a juke box (that looks like it's from the 70s...ooops).  As they were established in 1952, according to their signs, I guess they are trying to stay in touch with that...at least a little.

If I have a craving for a burger and fries, this would be my first or second choice of places to go.  A tad pricey, perhaps, but you can order various size burgers from 5 oz up to 24oz.  Did I mention they're really tasty?"}
{"text":"It took 10 minutes for me to receive the food through the drive through. The cost was $15 for a combo, which is a bit pricey in my opinion. Honestly, all the locations are costly and a bit of a wait but the Flamingo location is always slow!"}
{"text":"I tried the 1/3 or 1/4 lb Fatburger and I must say that I was impressed! The burger was fresh and tasty! I've never had relish on a burger so I was ready to dig in, the relish complemented the sandwich perfectly! I would recommend for people to give this joint a try if you are in the Las Vegas area!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday to meet up with friends at the food court. I had limited options for food since I'm allergic to Wheat, Corn, Soy, Sesame seeds... & much more.  

Literally my only option, what a miserable cashier.  She gave me attitude when I asked for protein style. There was a language problem, so I couldn't ask her portions sizes because she wouldn't understand me anyhow. The other cashier standing next to her overheard my order & told her what to do in Spanish. It's \"fast\" food I guess I expected too much. Burger was a small but it was shaped like a Pacman \"C\". It was black on the bottom.


$5 for a burger wasn't even worth it . I mean I ordered a small just to get an idea of the size of their small patty but still would be nice if it resembled a burger! 


Next time I'll go up a size. Great FIRST experience & service (sarcasm). Maybe I'll give this place a try in a few years again. Probably not!"}
{"text":"Went thru drive-thru, had to wait over 2 minutes before someone came to take my order. Had to wait 10 minutes for my order. The place is all falling apart...windows dirty, security camera hanging from the wall, signage broken, and many other items. This place is a POS!!! Do not go here!"}
{"text":"I wanted to eat a burger here since there isn't one where I live. Kinda pricey $17 for a burger drink and fries. The food was alright. I've tasted a better burger, fries including a drink at a little food stand in the downtown area where I work, for only $6"}
{"text":"I can't vouch for their tagline of \"The Last Great Hamburger Stand,\" though I like to visit several restaurants in a franchise before making an overall judgment. This particular Fatburger did not make a great first impression on me. I did enjoy the casual atmosphere and the outdoor dining, albeit really loud. At places like these, I like to order my burger with basic toppings like lettuce and tomato and no sauces or cheese so I can see how the burger itself tastes. Mine was overcooked, the edges fell off from being poorly made, and it was too salty. If you're here with a larger group, remember what you ordered. When the food comes out, the server will have all the burgers on one tray and all the sides on another, as opposed to serving each person what they ordered individually. Sodas at $3.50 and bottled water at $4 was a bit pricey. 

There's a much longer line for a burger at Shake Shack across the street, and maybe that's a tell."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews.  My experience was a good one.  The food was good and the staff was friendly.  The onion rings were cooked to perfection.  Yes, the burgers are a little pricy, but it's entirely your choice on whether you're willing to pay them.  I live down the street and will be returning."}
{"text":"Fatburger is definitely not the first place that comes to mind when I want to run and grab a quick burger. I have had the selections of burgers in the past and it's always just left me with that \"meh\" experience. I do though think that the chili cheese fries that they make here are beyond delicious! I thought I would treat myself this past weekend to this 1 million calorie side item since I've been doing so good on eating healthy. This location was in the area I was in so I thought why not drive on thru...or wait there is no drive thru? Awkward. I hate getting out of my car sometimes but I thought why not create a calorie deficit and walk from the parking lot to the door.. Kidding. I walked in and a god awful smell of maybe like an old mop and dirty water/the sewer system failed smell. Yikes. At this point I questioned whether or not I should even proceed with my order. I looked around and everything appeared clean so whatever ordered them good ole chili cheese fries with the steak fries as the fry choice. Total wait time was approximately 10 minutes which was fine because after all I did request that everything be made fresh! At this time it appeared only 2 employees were working, 1 who was full time just in the kitchen on the grill and the other who took orders and helped also in the kitchen. Everything overall was okay and my fries were BOMB I just need that smell, whatever it was to not like ever happen again! Thanks :-)"}
{"text":"I'm so surprised at how low the rating is for this location. I've always had great experiences here and the staff is very friendly! The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere is fun. I admit the burgers are pretty pricey (my husband and I can easily spend $25 for both of our meals), but the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"During Christmas break I tried Fatburger for the first time.  It was simply amazing.  The burger was moist and one of the best I have ever consumed.  I was kind of reluctant about eating in a food court at 10:00 p.m. But was not disappointed.  I had the original with fries.  Next time I'm in Vegas I will return.  Much better than a Shake Shack, In and Out and Five Guys."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I went to the counter and waited 5 mins. The cook or cashier saw me standing there and never acknowledge me. He could have said \"I'll be right with you\" but said nothing.  I continued to stand there and was never helped. I just left. Seriously needs better staff. Unacceptable"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this burger place for a late night dinner option so we decided to go so I can try it out. Fat Burger is an LA based burger chain with a location in Thornhill that specializes in tasty big burgers. At the restaurant, I ordered the original fat burger combo with fries and drinks. The food didn't too long to get. There is limited seating at the restaurant so we dined in. First bite into the burger and I fell in love with the burger. It was juicy, meat was good and the toppings were great especially when there's bacon too! Fries were good. Overall, a pretty decent burger joint to go to in Thornhill. The price point is higher than other burger joints but you are paying for the quality of the burger! Definitely check it out!!"}
{"text":"Skip, the bun, order by the patty only for a better deal.  

Your other options are over priced and not great (sushi) or lame suburban chains (Yard House).  I opted for a lot of these burgers instead."}
{"text":"My last experience at a fat burger was very vague, so to say less I wasn't really on the first train Smokin' to get here. Bowling with friends and drinking like a sailor led me to do it! It had to be close to midnight and I was shocked to see the sign still lit at the end of the dark food court. We sat at the bar and read the menu to the best of our abilities! 

Deceived by my beer goggles I felt the xxl would provide me just enough beef to feel like it wasn't quite a fast food burger.. to the burger I added bacon, cheese, and yess an egg! I also opted for a side of chili cheese fat fries and a Maui banana shake! 

To the facts. The burger was divine, well seasoned, and cooked fresh before our eyes! Oh yea that mofo was Humongous! The fries were huge and loaded with so much cheese and chili, they even provided me with Tabasco sauce to top them! Last and least favorite was the Maui banana shake. It was cool but I wanted more real bananas and I think I seen him use a concentrate which was not bueno!"}
{"text":"This place is good.  My friends and I went there a lot during our trip to Vegas.  They're 24 hours and taste a lot better than In N Out.  I wish they had a Fatburger near me. =("}
{"text":"Let me start by saying ive been to other fatburger locations that had great food and service. That being said, We were really disappointed about the food and the service, we went through drive-thru and ordered for three people. We ordered three burgers two with cheese one without. we all so ordered onion rings skinny fries and drinks. got home and realized we were missing one of the burgers, we drove 4 miles back to the location to be told by the workers that they didnt hear the third burger and so it was our fault. That if we wanted to replace it we needed to pay for it, even though we had repeated the order three or four time when we were first there.I returned inside to try to talk to them and both employees acted as if i wasnt there even tho eye contact was made. We then went back through the drive thru so we could talk to them since going inside went no ware. Once they realized it was us they insisted we come inside if we were to be helped, even tho we were behind 3 cars. After we finally got inside they handed us the burger and then apologized for the misunderstanding,  We drove home nearly half hour after the rest of the burgers had been made, just to find out that the other two burgers had been made wrong, and the rest of the food was cold. Most places would have offered to replace the order to start with. I most definitely will not be returning based mostly on the service not the product of the food."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I Freaking Love Fat Burger! seriously they make my favorite burger in Las Vegas I used to come here at least 4-5 times a month. I get a large with cheddar cheese and bacon. there sweet potato fries are great as well and who can complain about Haagen-Dazs ice cream milk shake? not me.
I am just sad that the last few times i have come in I have had to eat outside because the whole inside smells like a bad sewer. Im not just talking about, oh someone made a big stinky a while ago i mean my burger might have some sort of a poop smell. It was so bad the other day that I had to leave before I even ordered. I really hope they can fix this problem being that I love this place and it is the closest to my house. maybe a suggestion would be to have someone put some soap and water down some of the drain hatches weekly. That works at my business building. just a thought.. until then I will have to go to another location."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a good burger and fries at 2 in the morning. One time my husband picked out some songs to play on the jukebox but he didn't  put the right numbers in.  So Michael Bolton was blasted through the restauraunt at 2 am.  I don't understand why anyone would have Michael Bolton in the jukebox anyway????"}
{"text":"Unlike in places like Southern California where Fatburger has abandoned the crowded high-end fast food market and opted for urban stores in working class neighborhood serving primarily the minority communities, the Toronto version is aiming for the hip and trendy crowd that pays up to $20 for a \"combo\" and expects top of the line service and product. 

That's exactly where Fatburger fails however for that it delivers neither with a service protocol that is mundane at best (does anybody ever smile in here?) and food that is better than McDonald's but far from the quality available greatly elsewhere in Toronto. 

Points for cleanliness and pleasant decor, not much for everything else."}
{"text":"We stopped in here today for lunch. Definitely not the best dining experience we've ever had.

First of all the young girl taking our order seemed very bored with her job. No enthusiasm at all.

We both ordered a burger and fries with a drink. I assumed they'd give us our drink cups at the counter. When they didn't I assumed our drink cups would be brought to us at the table. They weren't. We went back up to the counter to get our cups.

There was some smell emanating from the restroom that smelled like spoiled air freshener if there is such a thing. My girlfriend said it was almost overpowering in the restroom. It was a really sickly sweet smell. I'm not sure what it was but it didn't make the burgers taste any better.

Here it is several hours later and I'm a little bit queasy. Not sure if it was the burger, but I haven't eaten anything else today. 

If it comes back up I'll change my review to a 1 for now I'll stick with my 2 star review."}
{"text":"It's average. Acceptable. Passable. Not great. Not terrible. It's just there.

The big draw is the size of the burgers, hence the name. You can get something as small as 2.5 oz. to as big as 16-24 oz. (2 or 3 of their eight ounce patties) If you have a big appetite and money to spare you won't leave here hungry. The meat itself tasted bland, though, and lacked flavor. I wanted to like it, but there was just something missing.

Even the fries were OK at best. There is something cool about them, though - you can get them in three different styles - skinny (shoestring), fat (almost steak-fry like) and in a sweet potato variety. So there's something for everyone here.

A word of warning - at this Las Vegas strip establishment, the prices are jacked up compared to regular Fatburger restaurants. It's the price you pay for eating near the action."}
{"text":"First off, I didn't love the food here.. but.... 

We were visited at 3 am and when we walked in they started blaring Biggie Smalls so loud. Everyone in line started dancing and singing. Even the fry cook was raising the roof. My friend was dancing like crazy. For the whole time we were there they only played Biggie and Tupac. So awesome/strange. 

Also at Fat Burger, some guy who said he was from the south side of Chicago gave me his CD. He said his friend was from WI and I said I was too. When he asked where I told him and he shouted out to 920, our area code up there.

The whole end of that night was super bizarro. There is video that exists somewhere and I must find it!"}
{"text":"It's The Strip. Everything is served with alcohol, overpriced, and over-the-top. Can't say that this place is an exception to this unwritten rule.

First off, it's a Fatburger with a bar -- an outdoor bar. I would have never guessed you could get fat AND drunk here.

Secondly, the burgers here are massive and come in four sizes: L, XL, XXL, and XXXL. I had the XXL, which was $11 without a drink and fries -- if you want a small combo, you'll have to pay an additional $6 for that. I guess rent here is that ridiculous. They even have a food challenge here. I can't remember the deets, but the XXL was large enough for me. I couldn't take on the XXXXL (or whatever it was) Challenge.

The meat was nice and juicy and flavorful, something we don't see much in Ohio with burger chains. As I suggested earlier, everything is MASSIVE. One burger and a cup for tap water should be enough, but if you insist on the fries keep in mind that your wallet is going to feel much lighter after you eat. With many burgers this size, I think to myself \"do I have to finish this?\", but not here.

While I have a beef to pick with the prices here, I will be coming back my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for those awesome fries and a coke zero. They have ranch and mustard for dippin on request"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick afternoon bite during my Vegas rendezvous this past weekend. A Fatburger with an outside bar???!!! I was hooked immediately! The ambience there was quite loud, considering there was a football game on. The TV's that they had outside made the place look like a very chill atmosphere. I grabbed a grilled chicken burger with skinny fries and I must say, it did not disappoint. I'm from L.A. and I try to eat here as much as I can! Yeah, it was more than I usually pay for that meal($11.85 to be exact!!) but hey, im not complaining. Its Vegas folks! Expect to spend a little while here. I will definitely come back next time I hit up the Strip."}
{"text":"It may sound odd to you...but Rex has had many disappointments in life. Losing ones I loved. Being rejected by Starr Jones. Falling in love with a woman with no vagina. Being forced to give up my Faberge egg collection. Having 3 livers give out on me.  Losing my Elite status on Yelp. These were traumatic. Some I have never recovered from...but I am strong. I am fierce. I am not one who needs to live in the past...I move forward. Onward and mostly downward...damn law against buying organs. Oh well.

I have had another bitter disappointment.  Fatburger. I want to say that my love of burgers is almost as strong as my love for the three things that mean the most to me...Emma Stone's panties I bought on Ebay, my Real Doll (minus head), and the picture of me mugging James Lipton in Central Park. So when I heard the Beastie Boys sing about Fatburger, when I heard my friends talk about FatBurger I got excited. As excited as when my Mongolian nursemaid used to change me when I was a freshman in high school.  

Well, this is not a story of long lost love. This is not a story of a guilty pleasure. This is the story of tears, screaming, two ambulances and 11 cop cars.

I will first start by saying that Rex does well in life. He wants for very little. So after I got done my panhandling shift on The Strip I decided to take my limousine...some call it a bus...to a Fatburger far away from that god forsaken place of broken dreams, Chlamydia, and overpriced drinks.  This is not my first Fatburger experience...but three hours of gas fumes, and a trip after 2 weeks in county lockup is not a good way to prepare for an eating experience.  

The first thing that happens to Fatburger is sticker shock...it is so damn expensive I honestly couldn't believe my eyes. I thought that years of sucking on bottles of a watered down bleach/ammonia mixture I call \"Blind Happiness\" had finally done permanent damage. The prices are outrageous for any \"fast food\" burger joint.  They charge 50 cents for CHEESE...REGULAR CHEESE!!!  How the hell can anyone justify asking 50 cents for cheese on a 9 dollar burger?  They have some gall. I haven't seen that kind of gall since the time I watched a guy take someone's kidneys while he was sleeping. It was amazing what you can do with two sleeping pills and a hacksaw.

Rex can live with high prices...IF...IF things are good. Here is the best part. The burgers suck. They are dry. They are over cooked. The cheese is bland. The toppings are flavorless. They need a special sauce or something to make their burgers worth ten bucks.  Two of us ate burgers, fries and drinks...for 25 bucks!! 25 bucks!! Here is what is the biggest crime...Burger King is better. Mcdonalds is better. Wendy's is better. Forget the really good places like In and Out or Smashburger...oh they are off the charts better. This is just a dry burger on a pedestrian roll with bland toppings.  Fatburger is living off  a name. Here is a name I have...RipOffBurger. This is awful. There is absolutely nothing special about this no matter how hard you try to find something...like Amanda Peet.

The shakes are bad and overpriced, the onion rings taste like they have been frozen previously, the fries were soggy and not crispy. There wasn't one good thing on the menu, and I say that with no exaggeration. EVEN THE SODA WAS WATERED DOWN TASTING! The mixture of the soda machine is desperately off. 

To add insult to our already crappy experience.  When I stood on the table, screamed that these robber barons should at least use a gun of they were going to rip us off...I was the one that the cops led out in handcuffs and leg shackles.  It is truly a world gone mad.  I think it was when I jumped over the counter and shoved their flavorless meat patties in the cooks mouth and screamed \"now you know how your mom feels when I go to your house.\"  The truth hurts too badly I guess.

Rex fights for you even though he hates you."}
{"text":"Only two people working. I was never greeted, I waited twenty minutes before I decided to leave. I will never come back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Fatburger is better than In-N-Out. There...i said it.

There's a lot more variety on the menu, and I'm down for any place that lets you put fried egg AND bacon on a hamburger. Plus they have onion rings. And it's right on The Strip, so it's easy to get to when you're walking around."}
{"text":"Mary was awesome! She was so nice and she just made my day! Very personable and kind. She deserves a raise! I will definitely be back! Thank you so much for just being exceptional!"}
{"text":"This is a bit of a hipster style Fatburger, it has an outdoor bar with WAY Overpriced Drinks and Beer, and Fatburgers average fare. The burgers are what they are, but they too are way overpriced as are the Fries! A Burger, Fries, and a Beer is probably gonna run you about $21.00 for mediocre fast food.
The music is blaring, and it's in a crappy strip mall in a dingy part of the strip, so you're not even paying for atmosphere. Overall if you're drunk and hungry a burger here isn't a horrible choice, but be prepared to pay top dollar!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this more props but... I really wasn't all that impressed. The hamburger was dry.

But... I love the name of the place. Love the jukebox.... and love the late night hours."}
{"text":"After a long day at work drove thru to order food. Waited 5 mins before the lady could take my order. Once she took my order it was a medium meal, xl meal with a shake and a kids meal. She told me the total $40 I was so surprised! I get to the window wait 10 mins before she collected payment. Then she told me after waiting 15 more minutes to pull to the front and they would bring my food out! I waited 10 more mins then I had to go in and get my food cause nobody came out!!!!! I just can't believe that I waited that long and paid $40 for something that I had to go in and get myself............ And all I got was a sorry. Waiting that long after a long day at work was the last thing I wanted to do. Won't be returning to fat burger ever again. Over priced and horrible wait time. Never fails but this has just topped it off from every visit prior."}
{"text":"This was an OK burger. This was my first time there and it was just that. I find that the only thing that separates these burger places are just how they build their burgers. I personally like 5 Guys better. I wasn't too impressed with the fries. It was a decent burger."}
{"text":"Absolutely, the ghetto-iest burger joint on the strip.  However, also muy deliciouso.

Be prepared to fight your way through drunken bachelorette's, greasy junkies, stoned ticket flickers, & priaptic midgets.

One of the best fast food(ish) burgers around...and they have Coke Zero at the fountain machine!"}
{"text":"As much as I plan to have a nice steak dinner or something of that sort when I visit Las Vegas, just being real, there is no time! I'd rather spend my days at the pool or shopping and nights at any hip hop night club dancing til the morning hours. With that being said I do not want to put my party dress on and sit down for a large dinner before I go out all night. I went to Vegas for six days and ate here 3 times. The last time was before I headed to the airport so I can have one last taste. There's no better way to drink heavily other than to eat here. The skinny fries are great as well as the onion rings. The burgers are by far the best. Fresh, tasty meat with great toppings. I wish there was one close to me! Love this spot"}
{"text":"Found hair in my burger.  While that is not completely horrible, I was put off by another thing I saw in the restaurant.  They had red buckets of Sanitizer sitting on the food preparation counter.  While I like to see a clean restaurant, I don't think keeping a bucket full of cleaners within a couple inches of the food preparation area is wise.  Also the staff was spraying window cleaner on fixtures they were removed for cleaning. This again is a nice thing to see, but not when the overspray was going straight into the food.

Maybe a one time bad experience, but it just looked like some serious lack of supervision of the staff."}
{"text":"I love the bay area, but it's missing my favorite burger stand, maybe the last great hamburger stand,  Fatburger.   I love fatbuger the way ed m loves arby's.  When lovie yancy opened the first fatburger she wanted to share the gift of a double king burger topped with cheddar cheese, bacon, grilled onions and a fried egg with all of los angeles.  Thanks to the beauty of expansion that dream extends as far afield as vegas baby...vegas.  I gotta say there is no better hangover deal on the strip than the aforementioned double king paired with fries insouciantly smothered in chili cheese and onions.  

My one gripe about this place is that they don't make the shakes fresh so they tend to be a little more solid than I'd like, but hey at least they're real icecream"}
{"text":"Big, fat, and juicy!
Nothing can ever go wrong with a Fatburger after a long day 'n night in the casino playing your favorite game. The juiciness of the meat is just mind blowing. 
You won't get any better burger on The Strip!
It's fast food, but still a little bit pricey (but hey, it's Vegas!)
They'll shout out your name loud (mostly during rush hour), so watch out!"}
{"text":"Do not go here. We had a groupon and they deleted it off of our phone and said it wasn't there. They also only had two workers working and were making the sandwiches without gloves on and the person taking our orders had dirty finger nails so I could only imagine what the other guys hands looked like. So we ended up not eating any of the food and just left. They're so disgusting don't go here. I would have left a 0 star review but that's not possible. Also they didn't even say anything to us till about 15 minutes worth of standing there."}

Margarita are weak they don't put any liquor on them...and they charge you $11 !!!!
Staff is extremely rudeeeeeeeee"}
{"text":"Just an update to this review:  FATBURGER   \"NEVER\"  replied to my email I sent to them about our experience!!!   Some customer service huh??????"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Loved the MEDIUM size burger with the fries. Believe me the medium is big enough... My friend got the XL burger & she was waaaay overwhelmed it was waaaay too big. The medium is perfect, about the size of a whopper junior at BK. it was really good. And the lemonade is bomb. Cool motown music blasting 4:00am on the strip, this is a cool place:)"}
{"text":"My favorite burger place by far. I think Fatburger has the best tasting hamburgers (get the works on it!)! And i love their fat fries! You can choose your hamburger size from small to XXXL. Service is always friendly  and your burger is always put on the grill when you order it, so it's fresh and not sitting around in a wrapper already cooked."}
{"text":"A regular cheeseburger, regular fries, and regular soda for $12.50?!

First, I have to acknowledge the cashier, Shanae.  She was excellent.  Helpful and outgoing to everybody in the restaurant.  I was so impressed with her service that I looked on my receipt for her name.  

The cheeseburger is good.  The fries were decent but not worth $2.99."}
{"text":"So I ordered a burger and a drink yesterday. Yes, ONE burger and ONE drink. The server thought it would be a good idea to include some ketchup, ok great! I could maybe squirt a sachet on my burger. I arrived home, looked in the bag, and the bottom of the bag was literally a TORRENT of ketchup packets. 25 packets. TWENTY FIVE packets of ketchup for ONE burger. 

You might give a middle finger to the environment, a middle finger to business profit (yes you should at least care about this one) and a middle finger to me (because there is no way you can give me 25 ketchup packets and expect me to do nothing). 

You wasteful people. When your grandkids are living on a garbage dump with seagulls as pets, you'll look back at this review and think, oh gee, maybe that '25 packet ketchup guy' had a point! 

My last visit! Well done. Clap clap clap"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. No one at bar and,the bartender doesn't ask if we need anything. Ok if this was my business  I would fire them!"}
{"text":"Wow two burgers in order of fries and one drink for $40... I'd say that's deep! The burger was actually really good the wait time was not too long. This was my first trip to fat burger this location was very clean, it was very hot inside, and fulfilling."}
{"text":"Fatburger is the perfect place to drunkenly eat burgers at 4 am. I think this will be one of my fondest memories during my Vegas weekend -- drunkenly chatting with you friends over greasy food... I particularly am thankful for my drunken munchies here because it prevented a terrible hangover (cue angel choir singing). 

This place isn't exactly the yummiest but it is when you're hungry at 4 am."}
{"text":"Great break from everything big on the strip.  Pretty interesting crowd but staff seemed to be on the ball."}
{"text":"If you mention you're a local and show your ID, they'll give you a 10% discount.

The prices here are a bit higher than normal.  The food is to be expected.  The staff was very nice.  

If you dine outside by the bar, the service staff will take your order there for you.  If you dine inside, you'll have to place your order at the window.

They played old school hip hop the night we went, so the throwback music was fun."}
{"text":"Ok...after you lose thousands of dollars at the casino, you can always run to Fatburger for cheap eats.  It's just too bad that it doesn't do a good job of cleaning the loser taste out of your mouth.

The junior fat doesn't nothing for an appetite and the steak fries are...well, just fries.  Nothing spectacular about this place.  Avoid it if you can."}
{"text":"Fatburger is good but this location is not. Had an encounter with a RUDE lady there. I went in to order a plain cheeseburger to go. I said cheese only--nothing else on the burger please. Not hard right? Burger comes overloaded with cheese and all other ingredients. Disgusting! I go back in and tell the lady. Of course she's right and I'm wrong right? According to her that's how she saw it. She claimed I didn't order a plain cheeseburger but rather I ordered it with everything. Right. No apology or anything. I patiently waited for my remade burger with no apology. I called corporate on this location and never heard back from them. Like I said earlier Fatburger is good but avoid this location. Disgusting rude people working here who don't care about customer service."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this location for sometime now and I've never experienced anything but great service and food here. Staff is quick here and food is ready in a reasonable amount of time. In my opinion these burgers beat smash burger and in n out by far."}
{"text":"I had no choice but to eat here... we were meeting friends. I will never eat here willingly again.

I paid $12 for a double burger (no extras), a drink, and fries.
... What a freakn' rip off.

The burger was OK. It was juicy and had some flavor it was only because they use very fatty meat and salt the hell out of it... yes, I can tell, I'm a very good cook. hey burgers are cooked well done - no surprise here for a low-quality burger joint.

I got the thick cut fries, thinking they'd be good... WRONG. Welcome to FatBurger where we serve fries that are exactly like you can get at the grocery store freezer section.  They sucked - period.

one word sums this place up... AVOID!"}
{"text":"So I've never been here before and it was conveniently right next to my hotel. I decided to stop here for a burger and see what the fuss was about and wowee it was a nice experience :) Our waitress, Lexi greeted us and was super friendly as if she was our friend for years! I ordered the crispy chicken burger, it was so crispy and moist! It wasn't a plain ol soggy burger from Mickey D's so it was a nice change. Lexi, our waitress would come by frequently to make sure everything was going well with the food and everything. All in all I would love to come back to Las Vegas and eat here again. There's no possible way to compare it with the Harley Davidson Cafe (which was mediocre at best)  down the street.. ::shudders:: 
Go FatBurger you ROCK ;)"}
{"text":"Greasy, disgusting, enormous, ohhhh my goooodddddd.

You know what you want when you get food here. Don't come expecting gourmet shit, it is what it is. Huge burgers with bacon, egg, and the regular fixins.

I love me some fat burger."}
{"text":"I didn't think it was possible to find a Fatburger that wasn't amazing like the rest, but I somehow found one (hopefully the only one) here at the Red Rock Casino.  What a shame too, because the Red Rock has so many great places to choose from that it is ironic to have a bad place in Fatburger.

I love Fatburger in general and while I think the prices are a rip at times, usually the taste of the burgers make up for it.  Not here, the burgers have been dry and salty (?) during my experiences and even smaller on occasion.  The folks behind the counter have been slow to prepare our meals and weren't the least bit friendly.  I guess I'll have to save my appetite for the crosstown version which is infinitely better."}
{"text":"Fat-ass-burger is among the best burger chains I've ever had and certainly will be the death of me if I continue to devour these wonderful sandwiches.  Each burger will pollute your arteries with endless clots and empty your wallet in a hurry.  The actual establishment is nothing to rave about, but the array of burger combinations are to die for.   There is no bare bones about it, its the most successful yet simple concept there is to be:  Its a burger.  Its big.  And its fat.  Its delicious as a result!

I heavily endorse the KingFatBurger (i.e. Royal Fatty) and with the Ultimate Big Fat Deal.  Its disgusting when you think about it but oh-so-good when you put it in your mouth.  The greasy texture is completely ignored as the gorge temptation gets the best of you.  Vegas is the city of sin and fun, might as well have fun with your sins and eat it too.  Yeah, I'm still talking about the burger."}
{"text":"boy, did I ever have 1 of the worst fast food garbage, customer experiences ever in my 57 years on this earth. and I owe it all to a crummy $5.00 burger with fixings that turned into a $10.00 + tip...im at sunset station so I'm taking my burger to go. i'd rather eat out at the slots...besides the fact that 9 times out of 10 the tables are always dirty in fast food places...while waiting I go up to the counter to get some napkins...I always need xtra napkins...I always make a mess and I have a condition where I constantly squeeze and wipe my face ..I only use a napkin 2 times ..im not wasting it...its just a nervous thing...and I shouldn't have to explain myself to anyone...I guess I was taking too many because the fry cook asked me why I was taking too many napkins...I told him I wasn't taking too many, but what I needed...he said he only put 4 in customers bags..and I'm saying how does he know what I need and who is he the \"napkin police?\"  I told him I only had about 7 and he said I had a whole lot more than that...well, I started to count them and guess what? that piss-ant was right...OMG!!! I had about 13. I was wrong and let my temper get the beast of me ...I told him he could have his stinking napkins and I brushed them off the counter...I asked for his name..couldn't see it of course. he was 15 feet away. he told 1 of the other employees to call security because we're gonna get rid of IT!  I asked who the MOD was? quess who? it was him....next thing I know security is escorting me out and I'm not allowed back for 24 hrs. I was embarrassed and humiliated.....oh, and after \"IT\" got her walker, her sunset cherry pie, her greasy-fatburger, cashed out her winnings, wrapped herself up, left sunset station as fast as my little prosthetic leg could get me to the bus stop....caught bus, walked another 20 min home..well at least I had a burger right?  well...needless to say it was cold...somebody made sure that bun was squished down real good...majority of the mushrooms weren't even on the burger,just squashed outside the bun....thank you for a lovely experience .oh my dogs loved the $10.00 burger..........oh and guess what? there were no napkins in the bag..........god doesn't like ugly..............god bless you , \"spanky\"."}
{"text":"I took the advise of a couple coming out of McDonalds that we should check out Fatburger that was right next door. This was the biggest mistake of my trip. It took no less than 30 minutes to get our food (two cheeseburgers and two fries) and it was completely burnt. The place looks like it belongs in a back alley with the floor and tables being torn up, but trust me, this doesn't have any of that hole-in-the-wall charm, its just sick."}
{"text":"It was cool....expensive because it was on the strip...I was still on from the bottle service we had that night (we went to fatburger at 3am) so my review isn't 100% clear hahahaha. But anyway, it was cool food, got the smallest burger and it was literally small lol! 

I'll be back, when I'm sober :)"}
{"text":"If your looking for a satisfying meal with a tasty burger, then this is the place to go. The staff are very kind and the service is fast. Order a burger from this place with everything on it, and your craving for hamburgers will be satisfied. I also recommend trying some of the buffalo wings with honey garlic. Overall, this place is where you would want to go for a good burger fix, and I definitely recommend coming  here if you want fast, quality service."}
{"text":"My BF loved it and thought it was amazing... He had a big beef burger with everything on it super juicy he thought. I had the turkey burger, I was not impressed, it was just maybe ok. Good service at a fair price for the area."}
{"text":"The burgers are fresh and the selection is good. Price is kinda in the high side but you get some good quality meat and  large portions top and the people are friendly.."}
{"text":"Spent $80 to take out food for the family. What a waste of money. Burgers were dry and overcooked. The buns were hard and fell apart. My burgers were broken and she put them on the bun anyway. Paid extra for bacon which was overcooked. They forgot to put cheese on burgers. The way they threw the burgers together  was like slop. I tried FB because I heard good thinks about them, never again. The only redeeming quality were that my onion rings and shake were the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Just had my first Fat Burger last night and I was impressed. I was starving so I got the size above the Fat Burger with bacon and cheese with the Fat fries. It was amazing. The patties were fresh and everything about it was prefect. I don't think that I have had a better burger. The atmosphere is great for being a fast burger joint. Another plus is that they have shallow ketchup cups. I'll never understand why the rest of the world doesn't catch on."}
{"text":"Customer service or lack of I should say. Went to drive-thru. Employee over the intercom took my order. Drove up, looked at me, no hello, no smile, no \"your total is...\" I handed payment, gave me change without a single word being spoken during the transaction. It was a young kid on a Sunday night, looked like he didn't wan to be there let alone give a rats ass. Service is HORRIBLE! Management should better train and educate staff on customer service. Would not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Placed order. Waited for about 20 minutes and my burger was made wrong. Wife's fries are cold.   Chose one star because I could not put anything less"}
{"text":"It's a good greasy burger.  This location is a bit dingy compared to others.  The chili cheese fries are great, and the burger is what a burger should be; it's fatty and flavorful.  It's not the best, but it's a good place to go if you're hungover or just craving something you know isn't good for you."}
{"text":"You're honestly better off going to mcdonald's. The food is way overpriced, but that's just a corporate issue. The issue with this location is that the restaurant was messy, the drink station looked like it hadn't been wiped down all day. The whole place is kinda dingy and gross. The food was also kinda sloppy. I asked the cashier to ADD grilled onions and yellow peppers to my burger, so naturally i got a burger with nothing but grilled onions and peppers. At this price level, you'd expect a gourmet burger, but it's actually worse than mcdonald's."}
{"text":"I gave it a shot because I use to love fat burger. It was the only place I could get a child burger in Vegas years ago. I was starving so, here I am. They don't take the on line coupons here. Its $30 for me and my kid. The food is not the Fat Burger I've had in the past. The burger is super greasy and the fat fries are hot but, soggy almost as if they were microwaved. 

I'm eating and all I smell it a dirty bathroom. How can I eat when I smell sewer. I'm disgusted. I'm not eating I'm leaving. 

I'm never coming here again. The smell is overwhelming!!!!

I'll go to Tommy's and get a real Cali style chili burger and not smell shit!! Never coming here again"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I can't believe how expansive this average burgers were.  I totally had better burgers and fries from greasy diners and at IN-N-OUT.  We also had chicken sandwich and it was nothing special.  I can't believe our bill was over 45 dollars for 3 boca burgers, 1 chicken sandwich, 2 small fries, and 2 medium sodas.  We will never go there again."}
{"text":"Welcome to the most ghetto and dangerous place in Vegas.  You walk in and all the extras that played roles in \"boys in the hood\" and \"menace to society\" are just hanging out.   I don't get how this place stays open when the white people that walk in are visibly fearing for their lives.  

Oh and the place has roaches that are visibly just crawling around.  

just don't do it"}
{"text":"If you have the drunk munchies, then this is the place for a late night nom nom session!

Open 24/7, and located on the strip. Everything made to order. The burger is so big I had leftovers for breakfast; no reheat needed! The sign of a finely crafted hamburger.

Well worth the jaywalk from the Aria."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night burger after hearing so many great things about Fat burger. I gotta say the first thing I noticed was how fast they move to service the Vegas crowds. We were greeted right away and placing our order.  

I ordered the Original Fat Burger which was a solid burger but didn't Live up to all the hype. The patty itself was very Juicy and well seasoned but that is really all that stands out. All and all I would go back for a late night burger but prob wouldn't go out of my way for it.  

The chocolate chip cookie by the way was delicious."}
{"text":"Overall good place to eat. In the middle of all the action and a very popular place for drunk ppl to eat at. Burgers contain alot of greece, so I recommend eating this if you want to sober up after a long night of drinking and clubbing. BTW fries are extremely HOT, so eat with caution. Fat Burger is open 24/7 so you have no excuse not to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Fatburger!!  They never disappoint!  Fell in love with them when we lived in Cali and we we're so glad they had one in Arizona!  Burgers and fat fries are always on point!"}
{"text":"Seriously I could have killed a cow and cooked my own burger faster than my one order came up...

I have to say the burger was good tho, when I actually got it... all the stuff seemed very fresh.

If you're in a hurry... don't bother... got time to burn, give it a whirl :)"}
{"text":"The burgers have great flavor! 
We ordered burgers that were quite modified and everything came out exactly like we ordered it. We didn't have to wait too long for the food :) 

The customer service here was good. They were friendly."}
{"text":"Huge burger!  Nice size portions.  The Chili on fries and the cheeseburger were extremely bland!!!"}
{"text":"On our last night in Vegas we decided to opt for a burger joint. We opted to eat outside and even though there were other customers smoking it was not a problem at all (we are both ex smokers). Ordered our food and shakes without any problems. When the shakes arrived they were thick and creamy just like they should be and the taste was really nice. The burgers arrived and they were thick tasty and juicy and cooked to perfection. We had ordered one portion of the thick fries and one of the thin fries. The thin fries were a little cold but this cannot be helped. The food tasted great and we both left feeling full and not over stuffed. If we visit Vegas again we will deffo use this burger joint again."}
{"text":"Meh. Okay burger, but way overpriced. Wouldn't go back unless it was 20-30% cheaper. You can get a better burger for less elsewhere."}
{"text":"A long overdue review

Love the 50-60's retro decor of the restaurant as it happens to be  one my favourite era.  There's also a nice big screen tv in the sitting area.  

Didn't know what to order so I ended up getting the FB original menu  However, I ended up liking more the pork pulled burger, a special limited promotional item that FB had.  Hope Faburger brings it back cuz it was so good~!!! to die for.  The fries and the poutine as a side were well made too. 

Pricewise, a little bit more expensive than most usual burger joints, However the quality is there and the ingredients are fresh..That is why I don't mind paying a little bit more for a great burger!    

Service wise, the staff is quite friendly and I like how they bring you the food to your table.

Washrooms are big, spacious and so clean! 

Definitely a great place to hang out after shopping at Vaughan Mills.

Even if not in the mood for a burger, this place has one of the best milkshake in the GTA.   Great hangout place to chit chat and relax on a lazy afternoon or right after work."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great \"after the club\" eats.  The place is open 24 hours.  I ate there two nights in a row.  First night I had the turkeyburger.  Very  juicy, the best turkeyburger I've ever had.  I had to wait a little bit, but it was so worth it.  The second night, I had the baby fat burger with fat fries (steak fries). So good!  
Because it's open 24 hours and most people do go there after the clubs you do get some sloppy loud drunks in there.  If you get irritated by those folks, just get it to go!"}
{"text":"Yummy, the burgers are good, the fries are good, the soda is good...

The employees are nice and you won't pay the price of a $20 room service burger, that's for sure.

Affordable and tasty...also, the location is pretty much tops."}
{"text":"Had to check out what all the hype was about, and I  must say the burger and fries were really good. Got the medium burger, well done with seasoned  steak fries. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. We sat at the outside patio area that was nice and clean. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"By far the absolute WORST fast food place we've ever been to. A homeless man sleeping on the chairs outside the door greeted us. We walked into the absolute worst smell EVER. Trust me I've been around meat my entire life and can \"tolerate\" the dead flesh smell but this was RANCID! Floors, tables, everything looked nasty I didn't even want to sit down let alone EAT here. We would've thought the place was abandoned but there was an older couple eating there when we arrived. Absolutely no emloyees in site. I wanted to leave immediately (which is rare for me) but my bf really wanted to eat so we proceeded to wait almost TEN MINUTES for a young girl to come to the register. We ordered one combo and one burger. $23!!!!At that point I'm like \"AW HE-- NO\". We went to olive garden & spent under $20 for all you can eat salad, soup & breadsticks AND you get a free wine sample. LOL Fat burger is more like a FAT FAILURE."}
{"text":"When I heard the name Fat Burger I was wondering if it was just a name. Ssure enough when I looked at the menu and saw an XXXL Burger any skeptical preconceptions on whether this was a serious burger joint were answered. 

\"NUMBER 8\" screamed the portly Hispanic cook from behind the counter over an Eminem song playing from the Internet radio juke box, signaling me to pick my order up. I ordered some fat fries and a large burger with the works. The burger was cooked just right, retaining the juices and the vegetables tasted fresh which is a plus in my book. The fat fries were piping hot from the oil bath. 

Not entirely sure if the other Fat Burgers are like this, but the Vegas ambiance and tasty burger made me a happy customer. Simply put this place shouldn't be compared to McDonald's or Wendy's. That being said  they can serve the burger to me through a hole for all I care as long as it's good and  I don't get food poisoning.

Happy Vegas fooding!"}
{"text":"A different sort of fast food restaurant.... they make everything fresh when you order it. The resultant burgers, fries and rings are pretty good for fast food. 

This is a good place to grab a quick, casual lunch while on The Strip."}
{"text":"I went to Fat Burger because I was craving something delicious... I ordered the medium burger, protein style or without bun. Unfortunately, I had to order it without cheese, but I added egg and I'm glad that I did. It was pretty tasty. I also ordered the fat fries (my favorite) Even without the bread it's a pretty filling meal. 

I had originally ordered it to go, but by the time it was ready I decided to sit at the counter and eat it right then. 

I'm glad that I did, this place is ran very well. Jovani (Spelling?) has worked at this location for as long as I can remember. He is excellent. Friendly, but professional. He helps to keep the other workers on track, but does his own job efficiently.

Priscilla was mostly working the cash register and taking orders. I also felt that she does a great job of multi-tasking. She's pleasant and quick. At one point the shake machine was giving another worker trouble and she was trying to help him with it. She explained to one of the customers that the shake machine was having trouble. I think it was too cold or something... I'm not sure, but the lady was so rude. She made some comment about how dumb do you have to be to make a shake. I thought Priscilla handled it very nicely."}
{"text":"This location is the best . Anthony is absolutely awesome  . I have a fat burger by my house on sunset road and it's very depressing how horrible the staff is there . The food is good but for some reason they always get my order wrong and are rude .  Not to mention ignore all my phone calls every time I try to place a delivery! If you live in this area go to sunset station for fat burger ! Way better customer service ! Thank you Anthony"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good!
Don't order a baby fat burger if you want a burger smaller than a McDonald's burger.. yikes..
Their onion rings are delish too! Not too greasy."}
{"text":"4 stars for a fried burger... not a bad rating from this burger snob. 

I prefer a flame grilled 1/2lb burger not a flat fried 1/3lb... but quality makes up for this. 

While it is very close to a 5 guys burger, i like that my burger was not well done. It is def better then all the fast food joints, less greasy then Johnny Rockets, but not as good as Fudds. 

The staff was nice, the place was a little dirty around the edges and can use a good scrub. Prices seemed good for what you get. 

I could be back sooner then later."}
{"text":"I really like to give locally owned businesses the thumbs up, but I cant here.  This family had their kids working here - none older than 9 or 10.  I'm glad they are letting them help and teaching them work ethic, but my burger looked and tasted like a kid put it together.  The place was dirty and poorly kept.  BUT!!!  There is potential here - All it needs is a little adult supervision."}
{"text":"Horrible.... sticky floors.... greasy dirty monitors...only one person to wait the front and drive thru and cook... the other person walked out while person 1 was on break leaving her alone.... ordered burger meals for 4 of us (nothing fancy) and the total was $50... I said you must be kidding... ... nope... walked out!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for a burger joint. That's right. The burgers are good. What really sets this place apart is the courteous and great customer service. I've never been to another fast food restaurant that came to your table to ask about your \"how is everything\" and offer refills. Great service good food equals great experience that's worth repeat visits"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped into this place for a drink and a side of fries.  I had a free drink coupon, so the bill was only a little over $10.  When I handed the bartender a $20, he assumed the change was his tip.  I was planning on leaving his $7 or $8 anyway since the bill was so cheap and he poured a stiff drink, so I didn't confront him about it.  The service was good and the drinks were strong, but I think the bartender should have allowed me to decide how much of a tip to leave for his service."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice... in the same week.(guilty....) 

the first time i walked in and it smelt heavenly!! i could smell the grills smoking away :) 

i love the retro interior... the silver and white tables and walls... i guess us blondes just like shiny things... who knows... 

i ordered a regular burger and a drink... the service was quick and orderly... i liked that there was a lot of room for people to wait and for those of us already seated don't have to have butts in our faces while we try to eat... that's a perk for sure... 

the location isn't to bad either... and like i said its huge for being a burger joint on such a busy street.... 

the Second time i went i had the turkey burger.... it was AMAZING!!!!!!! 
it didn't make me feel like i wished i hadn't .... it tasted in some ways better... and my favorite part of these delicious burgers is that they put RELISH on them as well and PICKLES!!!!! yum!!!! 

if i could... i would so eat here everyday.... mmmmmmmmmmmmm 

::drooling::"}
{"text":"I think their food is great, especially because I am a vegetarian and their veggie burger is insanely good. I give 2 stars because of the staffs attitude. When ordering I ALWAYS feel rushed, like they just want me to shut the f**ck up. After every sentence they just say \"Is that all?\" in a rude ass voice. One time I pulled up to the speaker and started ordering and I had alot to order for a lot of people and the girl must have thought her mic was off but we heard her say \"OH MY GOD...\" like we we're annoying her because she has to do her job? So I said \"You know what, f**ck you, you stupid ass b*tch!\" I drove around to see the b*tches face and I flipped her off and went to burger king.
***UPDATE****
AGAIN WITH THAT SALTY ASS ATTITUDE!!!
F*ck this place! My boyfriend and his friend went here last week and right when they pulled up to the drive through speaker, and this lady says \"how can I help you\", with out even giving him half a f*cking milli-second to respond, this b*tch yells \"HELLOOO!!??\" So my bf literally repeated exactly what I did when it happened to us the first time.
Here's a tip for the two stupid b*tch employees of this Fatburger: IF YOU DISLIKE YOUR JOB THIS MUCH, GO BE A DEGENERATE SOMEWHERE ELSE, PLEASE."}
{"text":"Immediately when I land in Vegas, my mouth begins to water for a fatburger. When you only come once a year, your's would water too.. or not.

I love that they have 3 different sizes to match your appetite. Small, Medium, or Large. You can choose whatever toppings and they'll get right to making it. The Strawberry shakes are absolutely delicious. I wish there were 2 different sizes for the onion rings though and I wish they were a little smaller. Other than that, see you next year!"}
{"text":"BEST burgers, FANTASTIC atmosphere, PHENOMENAL shakes and fries. We went three times, morning, afternoon, and middle of the night, and we were impressed every time. So much better than In-N-Out that the two cannot be compared. This food is one of the things I miss most about Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Fatburger. I hadn't been a customer in going on 5 years, when I chanced upon this Fatburger on Rancho,,,,

I ordered the xxl cheeseburger, chili cheese fries,  and a coke. I think the tab came to around $15, give or take a few.  Yep, it's a tad spendy,  but in my opinion you do generally have to pay for quality,  and for fair wages for the grill staff. I don't  mind, my understanding is  (  and maybe I'm  wrong,  but I don't think so ) they pay the workers better than most Fast Food burger stands.

Anyway,  the burger and chili fries were AMAZING. I'll  be honest,  the sheer size and majesty of that xxl cheeseburger scared me a little  ( that doesn't happen often ) I wondered if id be able to \"kill the beast \" !   Huge. Juicy. Flavorful. Unique. A classic monster built burger. Did I mention Flavor ?  Abundantly flavorful.

The chili cheese fries are also amazing - because they are prescisely  what chili cheese fries are supposed to be, in my opinion. Thick tasty fries, smothered in flavorful chili with cheese. No beans. No fake cheese. No greasy limp fries. They were wonderful.

Like I mentioned at the top,  I hadn't  been a customer for years. The last Fatburger I ate at was in Redondo Beach,  So Cal.  Then moved to Idaho,  then here to beautiful Vegas !   So happy to see Fatburger has a presence here  :-)  

For the \"chain \" burger stands
1)  SmashBurger
2) Fatburger
3) Tommy's 
4) In N Out


Not necessarily in that order,  depending on my state of mind."}

He Always goes above and beyond to take care of us the half pound fatburger and the crispy chicken always fresh and the drinks buy 1 get 1 come on it's the strip can go out have the best hamburger and enjoy drinks listening to some good music without going broke!"}
{"text":"We stopped in Fat Bar in Vegas  for dinner. The burgers were fresh and perfect. The oo9 ion rings are to die for. Fat fries, crispy outside and soft inside. Just the wasy I love them. Bobby our waiter/bartender was awesome so we had to stop in a second time for Patron sits to finish the evening. Great first night in Vegas for our mini vacation."}
{"text":"This place is great!  My friends and I went to Vegas last year and were looking for some food after our flight. We wandered the strip and came across fat burger. It was great. I can't remember exactly what we ordered but I do remember the milk shake was fantastic and I was sad we didn't get a chance to go back again before we left. I was also sad to learn there are no fat burgers by me. If you are in Vegas and looking for a good burger, go here."}

{"text":"Last minute search for something to eat. It was late, it was cold and Fatburger is a few minutes from our hotel so this is where my husband ended up.  He brought back burgers, fries & a milkshake for the teenager.  My burger was surprisingly good.  I loved all the little bits of onion throughout my burger and it was tasty.  I was told that they were greasy burgers but I didn't think so at all.  And the fries are yum too."}
{"text":"Ok so if you haven't figured it out I have become yelp happy lol. Tonight's Fatburger I must say was quite tasty. A double Medium with cheese, pickles and mustard really hit the spot. It's all about the pickle juice they put in the mustard, I even use it on my fat fries. Y'all know that I just had 5 guys but I had to come back to ol faithful. This location is always a hit an miss, but the new crew did Fatburger justice... I must say though when it comes to price and the extras for your burger there's this place with 5 guys that may now have my heart. What will be my next yelp be, any suggestions?"}
{"text":"Fatburger provides a solid quick-service style burger open 24 hours on the Strip right across the street from the Monte Carlo. 

When I went there you could choose from small through XXXL for the burger size. I heard from a friend that their used to be only 3 sizes. I think that kind of simplicity would have be nice since I was quite baffled about which size to order. The burgers are all cooked to order which is nice but may cause a little bit of a wait. Cheese, chili, bacon, and egg are all chargable upgrades for the burger while other condiments are available for no additional charge. 

I was talked into the medium size burger. I added cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. It was too big. I got to the awkward point in my meal where I was satisfied to be done eating but only had a little bit of burger to go. I decided to avoid feeling the gut bomb and just tossed it. Along with my burger I ordered the skinny fries which turned out were not really all that skinny. I mean, they were pretty much standard size fries. I think I would have been better off if I topped them with chili or ordered the fat fries or onion rings instead. Lesson learned.

All in all, it is a decent option for late night eats. Especially if you want to avoid the more notorious fast food burgers, and of course, you have at least $10 to burn on a quick bite."}
{"text":"Really nice food and great service. Cool environment and not that pricey at all."}
{"text":"This burger tops all other fast food burgers hands down. Love this place. I recommend this place to anybody who wants a good burger."}
{"text":"One of the few fast food chains that offers a veggie burger option. They use the Boca patty which is not my favorite. 

Pros
-Staff is friendly
-Offer a veggie burger, turkey burger
-Skinny Fries (not diet food but they are cut thinner than steak fries)

Cons
-Burgers don't taste that good. My veggie burger was very very lackluster and my friend's beef patty was apparently not a home run either
- Price : 11 dollars for a fast food  meal (burger, fries, coke)
- Not really fast food if it takes 10 min to get the food

It's going to be a long time before I go to FatBurger again. Not impressive but edible."}
{"text":"Came to give this place another try after a few years and I must say it wasn't as bad as the first time but still didn't taste like much. Ordered the small burger with bacon and cheese and a small order of chili cheese fries. The chili cheese fries were basic. I think this may be the finally chance for here for me."}
{"text":"If u want a shoe leather burger this is your place.  Burger was beyond well done, no juices and patty crumbled.  Would expect more for $12.17"}
{"text":"For rich people with no appetite. Paid $6 for a burger the size of a slider, what a rip off. This chain won't last long as they are overpriced, limited selection and no value. You feel more like you got robbed or fleeced after leaving here then full in the belly.

The staff was pleasant and the place was clean. The only issue was charging soo much for so very little. You spend about 60% less at the McD's, Wendy's and Burger Kings of the world and if you want a bit more flavor head over to five guys where you'll get a lot more bang for your buck. Otherwise, pay through the nose to get a thimble sized burger."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a VERY indulgent and greasy burger with egg and cheese. (groan) I can STILL feel it. :P But it's totally wicked after a good nite of clubbing and drinking. fer sure!!"}
{"text":"Employees are not knowledgeable about allergens and aren't even willing to make an effort to look. They need to learn the law before someone  that isn't as kind as me wants to make an example out of them. Shame on you!!"}
{"text":"Honestly was looking forward to having a good burger, but after a 35 minutes wait I had to go check what the problem was. Only to find out that my dine in order was sitting wrapped in a bag all the way in the back when they said that they had called my name. I came with my family of 4 which were all waiting on our call, they agreed that they never called our name. So after bite off a cold burger, and seeing that they had 2 orders wrong I decided to see if thy can make us new burgers. They didn't, they simply gave us our money back with a bad attitude."}
{"text":"The guys taking our order was very polite and helpful. Everything else was far from that is the best I can say. The completely messed up our order. Forgetting to add onions or removing pickles etc. It was just completely wrong! Not to mention when we took the food up to the front, they said it's not their fault. So whose is it then and what are we supposed to do? Eat the food we did not order for? Um no thanks. When we gave it back, it exchanged several hands and all they did was remove the toppings that were supposed to be there and added the ones we wanted instead of making a new order. I'm all for not letting things go to waste but removing mustard is a little difficult since the bread absorbs it. I was so disappointed and angry I didn't eat it. I ate the skinny fries which was good. We also got Oreo cookies and cream milkshake which was super delicious. Hence why I gave them two stars instead of zero! 
We came here around midnight but it was still busy. Prices are so expensive for a burger the size of McDonald cheeseburger and a kids size fries! The chairs and tables did not look wiped down and the trash was full. They have a lot of people working there so I was quite surprised to find it unkept. I did notice a few employees talking to each other or hanging by the bathroom. They really should delate the work to everyone. Maybe whoever made our orders was busy and needed help. Alas, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Very tasty burger! Skinny fries were just ok but nothing special. This hit the spot after drinking and dancing! Just a little over priced for what you get"}
{"text":"Don't go to this Fatburger unless you're prepared to endure disappointment after disappointment. 

It began with ordering our food. My mom ordered a burger without the bun, which isn't anything outrageous these days, but for the woman taking our order, she had to go back and get the manager to assist her in completing the rest of our order. In total, we were up at the counter for over five minutes. 

After ordering, we sat down and waited...and waited...annnnd waited...annnnnnnnd waited. I'm not exaggerating when I say we waited 20 minutes for our order of three burgers and two fries to arrive at the table. And it's not like the place was packed; we were the only people there, other than a party of five that walked in about ten minutes after we arrived. 

Once the food arrived, the manager apologized as one of our burgers was incorrect, but we didn't really feel like waiting an additional 20 minutes for a new one. There was definitely some temperature consistency issues as well, since our food was hardly warm by the time it arrived, most notably the fries. 

After bringing us our food, the manage went outside to smoke, as she was sitting right outside the window next to our booth. Another large party walked inside and started ordering. Once again becoming frustrated with the ordering system, the same employee who originally took our order when to the door and shouted to the manager \"Get your ass back in here!\" 

Overall, I don't mind Fatburger for its food, it's okay for what it is, but I probably won't be back at this specific location. The entire experience was unpleasant from the get-go."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good. What i enjoy MOST are the curly fries, and the milkshakes. Those are the best. The burgers are REALLY pricey in my opinion. You may spend about $20 for a regular sized combo. But i would go back. Especially for the milkshakes and curly fries!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers here. The egg on the burger is awesome! Other fatburgers I've been too (Seattle area) did not measure up to this one. The food was awesome. And the speed of the service was decent considering how busy they always are."}
{"text":"AMAZING!

Quick service for fresh food!  I had the baby fat and it was MORE than filling.  Loved it!  Had the onion rings.  Loved them too!  

Go there.  It is quick, cheaper, and 24 hours!  I wish they had on in Chicago!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch to see how the food was.  Easy to find and parked at the United Artists movie theatre next door and walked to the restaurant.

Upon arriving there, the layout was very nice and they were playing hip hop music which got me motivated to sit down and have a bite to eat.  I ordered the XXL burger with bacon and cheese with a side of Fat Fries.  Next door was a full bar that was popping and I ordered me a large daiquiri to go with my food. The XXL burger was very Yummy and Juicy.  So Delicious.  The XXL Burger did cost a little more than I expected but the taste made up for the money spent.  

Overall this restaurant was Ok, a little overpriced but very delicious and I would definitely visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Ok, first off, this place is ridiculously priced!  I know it's going to be inflated a bit, but I paid over $10 for a regular old cheeseburger combo.  I think I about fell over when my husband showed me the receipt!  As for the food, it was OK I guess, nothing worth that price to be sure.  Fair burger and pretty tasteless fries.  The service was alright, but it was almost empty to begin with."}
{"text":"Whats not to LOVE about Fatburger?? If you're looking for a Greasy, Cheesy, Thick Burger that will help clog your arteries THIS IS THE PLACE!! 

If I'm ordering a burger I am having a cheat meal from my 85% Clean Diet. Cant go wrong with ordering a Vanilla shake either."}
{"text":"There are only a few places I trust after a certain hour and this place is one of them. The food is made fresh to order. If you order inside or the drive-thru you should be prepared to wait. Since they are making it fresh it can take a while.

First, get familiar with the size of the burgers here because they can get B-I-G! They have combo meals or you can easily just get a burger to satisfy your hunger.  
Here are burger sizes:
Small - 2.5oz
Medium - 5.3oz
Large - 8oz
XXL - 16oz
XXXL - 24oz

As you can see they have a size for any stomach. There are also a nice variety of toppings you can add to your burger.

They have a variety of crispy and grilled sandwich options. 
If you prefer turkey or veggie burgers they have them too!
You can also choose from chicken strips, hot dogs, and salads.
They have \"fat\" and \"skinny\" fries.
Grilled onions, jalapenos, and peppers are available upon request.

The shakes are ALL very good! Try one *if* you have room after your meal :)

If you like breakfast check them out for that sometime they have a pretty good bacon and egg sandwich."}
{"text":"It's a fast food place.. The burgers are good the bread was hard it reminds of Johnny Rockets. The sweet potato fries were soggy.  the serve you the food knowing the cheese didn't melt on either the fries and burger who does that??? had to change my order the large burger with sweet potato fries. Not a fan of cold food"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here, all thanks to this blonde girl bartender with a septum ring, wish we could remember her name. She went above and beyond what we asked for to make sure our experience was wonderful. She was friendly, inviting, and accommodating. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really just made me wish we had an auto vehicle and could sputter to an off-the-strip In-N-Out.

Watching football on a breezy patio was a nice alternative to the smoke-infested sports books, though."}
{"text":"Dbl turkey add chz no relish and a large lemonade...#checkmate."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not as great as everyone makes it seem.
I would choose In and Out Burger ANYDAY. The burgers are extremely small for their price. It was almost $5 for a small burger that was the size of a microwavable burger you would get at AMPM. I was soooo disappointed when my guy friends ordered and ate the entire thing in about 3 bites. I had ordered the medium sized meal for a little over $10 and that included a burger twice the size as the small (yet about the same size of a regular in and out burger), steak fries and a medium drink. This was by far the most expensive fast food that I have ever purchased and tasted like I could get it at my neighbor's BBQ next week. They did not have any special sauces so I was bewildered to see how this was considered a top place to go to late at night. Particularly because there is a McDonald's next door and dollar menu was looking mighty fine after this disheartening meal. If you wanna save some money as well as have a good meal, I'd suggest you walk 10 feet away to the Mcdonald's next door and have a feast."}
{"text":"Burgers are good.  But really thin patties.   Really not much meat at all.  As with most places you get way more bread and bun then meat.   If your carb conscious opt for lettuce  instead.    They do have some killer shakes though"}
{"text":"This place has the longest drive through ever. I'm the only one in the drive thru ... and the guy says just a min.. it took 10 mins before he get my order then when I went to window another 20 mins more waiting for my order ... they always have short staff only 1 guy is working! 
Horrible service!!  Not many people go there as I pass there  many times a day. I have no clue how they stay open"}
{"text":"Meicore food, yet way over priced. 
The dining room is disgustingly dirty. The chairs look like they are never wiped down with stains and black grease on the leather. The floor is unmoored and unswept and they JUST opened an hour ago...that tells you they don't care. What's the condition of the food preparation equipment if he dining hall is his nasty? Never again coming here...."}
{"text":"Best fatburger in town. Big ups for staff, service and quality"}
{"text":"For vegas, really great price on food. Great service, they are pretty nice for seeing tourists all day, and man...my burger was awesome. I remember thinking it was one of the best and cheapest (ratio wise) burgers I have ever had."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about lunch but for breakfast definitely steer clear of breakfast at this place. Oatmeal was nothing more than a prepackaged box they hand you to make yourself. The eggs were good same for the breakfast potatoes. So if you want a simple egg and \"hash\" meal it's good. Just don't expect anything too exotic. IE: oatmeal."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Open 24 hours,  they welcome all sorts of fun ppl just looking to have a good time and don't want the party/good times to stop while grabbing a bite.

The staff here are fun and hilarious, from cashier, to ppl serving food, to ppl calling out orders.

Had a laugh w/the cashier, the lady calling out the orders wouldn't let me have my food unless  I yelled my order out or yelled where I was from, lol.  Lucky I had all my friends w/me to give a shout out to OC, represent!  Customers made the wait fun! 

The wait's kinda long, but like I said the staff and customers make it fun.  Thumbs up for ppl who love what they do!"}
{"text":"I walked in with my wife wanting to try the XXXL food challenge that Fat Burger offers. The cashier was fantastic. He explained all the rules and what I needed to do to be a winner. My wife ordere a Baby Fat and it was cooked to perfection. I went for the XXXL Challenge. I sat down and dove into this 5LB burger! After about 30 minutes I was finished at the Fat Burger staff was amazed. They took my photo and posted it on the wall. They also gave me a certificate showing the achievment. Great place to have fun and try a food challenge."}
{"text":"\"Mom, have you reviewed Fatburger yet?\"

5 minutes later: 

\"So, Mom, have you reviewed Fatburger yet?\"

Sigh.

So, you guessed it, I am reviewing Fatburger. This marks the start of a series of review based on my teens' favorite hang-out spots. 

I'm not really into burgers. Guess I'm at a point in my life where 50 grams of fat and 30 grams cholesterol just aren't that appealing. But I can understand the appeal of FatBurger. Big, fresh, non-fast-food-ish burgers. Both the Fat Fries and Skinny Fries are done really well. All this and a fun 60's vibe.

\"Hey, Jeff --- I just reviewed Fatburger.\"

\"Cool. Mom, have you reviewed Rubios yet?\""}
{"text":"I asked if they had kids meals & she said yes. I ordered 2 kids' cheese burgers with a small fry & small drink .... $$25. So that's $12.50 for a kid's meal. My boys are 5 & 7 years old. The kids meals prices were not posted, there was no display showing the price as she rung it up, nor did she give me a total before she charged my card. Is it me or is that kind of expensive for fast food?"}
{"text":"Their burgers were ok I'm mean especially a night of partying they're open 24 hr. They are definitely better that mcdonalds."}
{"text":"OMG, our last day in Vegas I stopped in and got a burger and margarita and Ice Cube wasn't lying, Fat burger is the best burger I have had in my life, the thin egg and their lettuce really round out the ultimate flavor experience. I went back about 10pm and got another one I liked it so much."}
{"text":"Great burgers, super delicious, the burgers are made fresh so they take a while to make, but well worth the wait. And they are 24hrs."}
{"text":"Great for a cheap burger fries and beer.  Friendly quick staff. Check for a groupon deals. Large outdoor area with lots of flat screen TVs."}
{"text":"I had never tried Fatburger before, but everyone told me it's one of the best places for a cheap burger and that its open 24/7 just north of the MGM. Well, I was surprised how good the food here was. I got the 1/2 pound or whatever burger, and my friend got the turkey. The turkey burger is kind of mediocre - the patty is dry and thin. Their regular burger is quite good. Very satisfying for what is a five dollar burger. I expected it to be really greasy (probably because of the name), but it was actually just a very good burger. The fat fries are also quite good. I will definitely think about this place next time I'm looking for that cheap burger in Vegas at 3am..."}
{"text":"Food isn't worth the price. For a family of four we should had driven down the street to Red Robin where the seats were comfortable. Fatburger was run down and not clean for the price we paid. Four burgers, three shakes and two fries was 60.00!!!! The dining room is uncomfortably hot and the chairs are old and uncomfortable. While the food is good, we can get full service at Red Robin or a bigger variety for less at Habit Burger. Or if you are looking for late night burgers, hit the In n Out drive though. Just took this off the list of places we will eat at."}
{"text":"I got sick twice after eating there! The first time I thought maybe it was because of something else so I went back. What a big mistake! My husband got sick as well. I will never ever set foot in this place again!"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular about this burger. I used to love fat burger for the food, not the prices but my meal was not as I remembered. The burger was under seasoned and the egg was wayyyy over cooked. Even the onion rings were nasty. The only thing that made it worth while was the shake, still one of my favorite fast food shakes and probably the only thing I will return to get."}
{"text":"Demolished their XXX Challenge after a full day of eating... lol But, despite it being a challenge, the burger was delicious! Not much else to say about that because there wasn't really any special things that any other burger joint doesn't already do, but they are open 24hrs!!!! Huge Plus!!!! Definitely will return to conquer another XXX (just because I can)... Btw, they employ a lot of Polynesians, Much Mahalos for that! Feels good to see my own peeps around, and working!!!"}
{"text":"We're die hard Fatburger fans and stop in every time we're in Las Vegas.  Tonight we stopped in and found that the place has been completely renovated - no issue with that, it looks a lot better.  
The only thing that was not better was the food!  The decline in quality was not what we expected but neither was the sharp increase in prices!  $30 bucks for 2 burgers and fries is too much to pay for a strip mall burgers.  
We won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"So after quite a bit of day drinking, and a nap that lasted for far too long, we woke up and came here for dinner at like 12:30 a.m. and there were plenty of people outside still. We found a table outside and waited for a while..like 15 minutes before someone even came over and acknowleged us. We were getting pretty irritated when finally a guy comes up and asks if we'd been helped.  After we told him no, he said ok and walked off...within like 2 minutes he was back to take our order. 

There were 3 of us, and we all ordered burgers with fries and a water. I got the 1/2 lb fatburger with the skinny fries. It came out after a brief period and I devoured it. I hadn't eaten since lunch, and it was delicious to me. Looking back, it was probably just average, but delish at the time. It was juicy though, and had great toppings. The fries were good too. 

I thought this place was ok. I'd probably come back- if I knew we wouldn't have to wait so long to order. Prices weren't too bad"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!! I ordered a turkey burger, was served beef. It was burned and waited 30 plus minutes for it.  I was with ten other ppl. ALL of our burgers were burned. I went back to the cashier to tell her. She was mean and told me to move out of the way and that I had to speak to the manager. The elderly night shift manager told me to give her my receipt and they puffed up like they were going to fight me. Another cashier started at me. I held out both my receipts. they refunded my money and yelled at me to throw my old food in the garbage that I gave back to them. Never apologizing for quality or service, I turned and Walked away. The cashier and manager yelled at me from across the casino!!! to throw my tray out. So unprofessional. They're lucky my entire party didn't demand refunds. the way treated us is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I DON'T like fat-burger. It is expensive and in my opinion, not even as good as a Wendy's big-bacon classic. FAR Inferior to the In-n-out double double that costs like 65% less. Hell, even the name turns me off big time. May as well call it \"Fat-ass-burger\".

This is not even a place I'd go drunk anymore. I'd rather \"think outside the bun\" for 1/4 the price and probably half the calories."}
{"text":"So yesterday I found myself without a lunch at work.  Normally my driver goes for take out so when that happens I will just order something from wherever she is going.  Well it turns out she had brought lunch.  I had walked by the Fatburger in Tempe and on Las Vegas Blvd several times but had not tried either.  I had the time so decided to make the 15 minute drive over there.

I did take out so I would not be away from the shop for too long.  I arrived about 11:45 on a Friday which should have been a busy lunch crowd.  With todays economy I am not sure that is a normal statement any more.  The manager was having a smoke on the patio and greeted me on the way in.  Three tables were occupied, two full and one with one person.   As I walked in and was looking at the order board one of the customers came up to the two people working in the cooking area with a problem.  Seems his hamburger wasn't right and there seemed to be a problem describing what he really wanted or by the employees understanding what he was trying to explain.  The manager saw the exchange and came in immediately, figured out what was needed and the next hamburger off the grill was prepared correctly and delivered to the table by the manager with apologies.  In these days of patrons expecting free meals and future discounts I feel this was the proper way to fix things, the customer was not rude and he got the correct, fresh, not reworked, hamburger in short order, problem fixed without any fuss.

The manager then came over to the register and took my order, sensing it was my first time he guided me through the options.  I ordered a Fatburger less mustard, plus cheese ($4.49) and onion rings ($3.29).  As he was taking the order he hollered each item out to the staff and when complete took them the paper copy.  Must be the corporate way to do this.  The order was ready in about 10 minutes.  The burger was good but not fantastic, the bun was fresh and soft.  I consider it a good thing not to succumb to pressed onion rings however these folks have found a way to squeeze the maximum number of rings per onion.  The thin rings of onion with one exception were barely enough there to hold the batter and you could not taste the onion.  The oil was at the correct temperature so the batter did not absorb grease or have any off flavor.  I would definitely pass on the onion rings next time and try the fries.

Overall it is not a place I would go out of my way for but if it was convenient it wouldn't be out of the question to go again.

Directional note:  Google maps shows it on the SE corner of 28th Dr. and Peoria, it is really on the SW corner."}
{"text":"absolute garbage. we waited over 30 minutes for our food. the fries are cold and the burger is burnt. thank god the meal is comped from the casino. none of the employees know how to cook, clearly."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.Went here on 08/24/2013 at about 6 pm and was my first time being at any Fatburger and if all other Fatburgers are run this way it will be my last time entering a Fatburger. The line to order was painfully long, and as we were standing there i found out why, all the people working there looked like they were on Quaaludes...they were working soooooo slow...like they didnt even care, I ordered the XXL burger and sadly it wasnt all that good , the burger was very dry i also ordered the chili-cheese fries and the chili tasted like Hormel chili from a can....very disapointing

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Fat Burger. LOL I was craving it and I got there at 9:27 at night. I looked it up online and made sure they closed at ten. When I got there they had the open sign still on and the doors locked. They just starred at me as I shook the door handle. I was pretty disappointed. The next day I still wanted to eat there. I went there during the daytime. The staff is a mess. They are so unprofessional everyone is running around, laughing and playing. So many people backed up waiting on their food. I couldn't even figure out who was managing the place. I don't think I'll be eating at this location any longer."}
{"text":"Worst service and on top of that they take forever. I waited almost 20 plus minutes at the drive thru to get my food which was only 2 burgers and 1 drink btw they took my order down wrong. It's over priced and place looks run down and ghetto!"}
{"text":"Arrived here at around 6:30am..ish..and they're open 24/7.

Feet were dead! But, had to come here and get some grub after Drai's. Although I was exhausted out of my mind, the workers kept me laughing. 

For being so early in the morning, they all had so much energy! All young cats too. All happy, joking with each other, being silly..I loved it!

It brings a great atmosphere to the place. 

Ordered me a medium with cheese..bf got the XXL with cheese and bacon. Also got a side of onion rangs..mm :] 

Asked for ranch, and they gave us the Hidden Valley. BEST RANCH EVERRR! 

Onion rings=amazing.

Burger=Delicious."}
{"text":"Mmmmm the burgers here are awesome! I ordered the fries, though I was too full after eating my burger and shake that I didn't have room for the fries. A note on the shakes: they are the best! You can tell they are made with real ice cream because the texture and taste are just right.

The location was a little dirtier than other locations I have been too in the valley, but the food was good and the music fun!"}
{"text":"So there was booze involved, this was in Vegas after all. I have been to many fat burgers in my life but this was hands down the best. 

Special ordered of course, just requesting to leave off the bun which kind of confused the cashier but the cooks were all over this request. Packed our two patties into a little fry container and then topped it with all of the traditional fat burger toppings. 

Fantastic drunken nomz."}
{"text":"Don't want to give it a star. Went to drive thru the sign advertised sweet potato fries 1.79 got to window paid receipt showed 4.09 question it and was told board wrong and they refused to adjust. I also order 2 kids meals that came 15.58 for 4 chicken strips total, that was 2 strips each.  Never again that price for subpar food. Burger wasn't that good either. I wanted to try, shame on me. By the way I gave them Back those sweet  fries told the manager/cashier told him false advertising was wrong."}
{"text":"Burger is expensive for what you get. I do like that it is all hand made. The smallest size they have is about the size of a slider. Everything together was pretty decent.  You can have the onions grilled or however you choose which is really cool. 

Would I try it again? Not really. I would prefer a different burger join of cheaper price. But if friends wanted to go eat it, I would be glad to go eat it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch now, and I like it....mostly because it's one of the few burger joints that has a veggie burger...and I like their curly fries!  The staff has always been nice too.  :)"}
{"text":"It's very disappointing how you are taking advantage of the nye guest by raising your prices today!! Seriously...
False advertisement when you have a displayed menu with listed prices and then you hand the outrageously priced menu for the day!!"}
{"text":"Labor Day Week 2016: I experienced a Fat Burger and it was very tasty!! The meat is cooked well done if that's what you prefer yet, not over cooked, well seasoned! Perfect for after partying..."}
{"text":"Love Fatburger, service was great.. just like other parts of the strip it is crowded and loud but the food is great."}
{"text":"Seriously have no idea why people think this is even remotely a decent burger.  For fast food give me In n Out or nothing.  This burger is boring, no flavor at all, no seasoning no chargrill.  Average.  Would rather be Tom Hanks in Castaway and eat a crab that is still living."}
{"text":"Bueller, Ferris, where's the flavor.  Absent.  I had an expiring groupon for Fatburger and decided to get a to go order for work lunch.  Staff service is ok, but they had the order set up for to eat there. No biggy.   We got our order quickly and had ordered the medium fat burger.  I got the onion rings and my co-worker got the fries.  I could not taste any flavor from the burger, and the bacon had that crispy leaning on the side of burned taste.   The onion rings tasted like the onions were fresh, but still the taste was lacking.   Fatburger, I'll pass.  This place is one where I will keep driving past and not stop again."}
{"text":"I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best
But I'm fly at Fat Burger when I'm way out west!

So the lyrics led me to this place but I must say it didn't live up to the hype.  The burger wasn't terrible, but I've had better.  WHAT-A-BURGER beats the hell out of it.

The burger patty reminds me of the patty at Freddy's Frozen Custard, Culver's, and Steak and Shake.  I had mine built with the default config which includes sweet relish.  I knew that going into it and thought i would try it.  It was a mistake - just plain weird.  Hold the relish next time."}
{"text":"Walking the strip and the guy said two for one which caught my attention. Service was actually really good, The drink was a little watered down. I love the steak fries and the burger was actually good. The one negative was my friend said no tomato on her burger as she is allergic to tomatoes and they still added it so we had to send it back. Over all decent place for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"I USED to love Fatburger. The location @ Green Valley Ranch changed my mind forever (my first time trying that location). I live here in Vegas, close to Green Valley Casino. I thought it would be a nice Sunday outing -- wander through the casino and savor one of my favorite burgers. I ordered a medium burger, skinny fries, medium drink and my husband ordered a medium burger and we shared the fries and drink--the total was over $16!!!!! I wouldn't have minded the price so much if the food had been as I remembered. The burger was disgusting!!! The meat was overcooked and tasteless. The bun was crumbly dry. They didn't even get my order correct. My Fatburger days are officially over. I'm sticking with In-N-Out from now on! Someone from the Fatburger franchise operating company needs to visit this store and see the miserable product they are turning out. This location gives the entire chain a bad name. For shame!!!"}
{"text":"I have an exact plan of how I like my Vegas:
It goes like this: 
1. Get off the plane
2. Get a rental car (and pass out as many extra discount coupons [$20 off a weekly rental! Free upgrade!] as I can that I have from my Entertainment Book to the people waiting in line behind us.) 
3. Drive as fast as possible to the Strip.
4. Pull into Fat Burger's parking lot
5. Order and wolf down a Fatburger with cheese, steak-cut fries and a strawberry milkshake. Only sometimes I deviate and get skinny fries. This is the ONLY order we do things in upon arrival. Even on our honeymoon, it went in that order...but those of you who know that we rock the \"NFP lifestyle\" can understand that there was really no hurry to get to our Honeymoon Suite. Gotta love Peak+ 4.  

My first two visits were pure heaven. The following two, especially the last, left much to be desired. In a span of two years, the interior seemed to have taken a major beating, and it was just dirty. Ketchup all over the place, dirty tables...sometimes no tables to sit at if you go in the afternoon. During the wait for our food, I felt a strong need to wash my hands after using the soda fountain, getting my condiments, ect. Also, the employees seemed almost unhappy to be there, further making me doubt that they cared about preparing my food in a sanitary matter.

I gave 3 stars because good burgers DO live here! I've had them! I just don't know if I'm quite ready to go back. I'm ready to be introduced to the next best \"burger fix.\""}
{"text":"A Las Vegas Tradition! Me and the Cuz have to have Fatburger at some point between midnight and 5am during every Vegas trip (no exceptions). It's interesting just to people watch and see who comes in at those hours. 

I'm a fan of the fatburger and fat fries ... but they have skinny fries as well. I'm pretty simple at that time in the morning/night. 

They really have revamped this place ... the outside is a nice lounge-y area now and they have a slushi bar that I haven't tried yet (definitely going to next time)."}
{"text":"I live in the area and I had a serious burger craving a couple hours ago. Every time my boyfriend and I go to Red Rock Casino, he gets Fatburger so I decided to give it a shot. Our cashier was clearly miserable with her life and it was everyone else's fault, apparently. The burgers were not timed with the fries, by the time we got our burgers, they were cold. Fries were bland and unseasoned. I got the thousand island burger and there was barely any thousand island on it. Both of our burgers were dry and to top it off, something was wrong with the soda machine. The syrup in the Coke was running out so we gave it back and got an iced tea instead. That also tasted weird. I'm all set with eating here again. If you're at Red Rock and want something in the food court, you're way better off with the yummy fish taco place or capriottis (I think I'm spelling that right)."}
{"text":"Literally the worst costumer service. I've been at the sports book all day my first order took over 20 mins and I sat there watching the employees talk to their friends that had come to see them instead of watching the food cooking. My order was wrong. Then when I went back to get a friend of my something the girl told me she has 5 orders and to come back later when she was able to catch up."}
{"text":"Okay, I admit it. I didn't eat here... but I can still review ( & update later!)

I was waiting in line to get an application... Wait Time: EST. 15 Min.?!

No joke, RedRock is always poppin'.. especially lunch time.

As an interested to be employed, I was keen on the chemistry of the workers.

They are nice. Individually speaking.. But it gets so busy that they lose the camaraderie feel as a team. Like factory line robots.. that cook burger meals.

Anyway, I'm sure the food's good.. It sure smelled like it. But to be part of the workforce with Fatburger..

I'll try In-N-Out instead."}
{"text":"My experience at this location was far from satisfactory . I placed my order at the window with Anabel, waited maybe 5 minutes for her to take the money for the order . After about a 15 minute wait in in the drive-thru , I finally got my food . I get home and take a bite , only to realize almost ALL of the toppings were missing from my burger . Thanks for the lettuce and turkey patty but where's the thousand island dressing , pickles and onions I ordered ?? 
So I call and the lady in the kitchen says I got what I ordered . I drove back for my refund and had to write on my receipt as to why I wanted my money back ! I will NEVER return . There was no apology , no offer to fix things , poor customer service and no responsibility taken ."}
{"text":"Thoroughly underwhelming. Crispy overdone meat, mediocre quality of ingredients no unique flavor.  Bobby Flay's place across the street should not worry. The only spark of innovation they have is a hamburger that's well over a pound"}
{"text":"They seriously have the best buffalo chicken sandwich I have ever tasted! Fresh veggies, delicious sauces and thick hunks of meat all on a butter-toasted bun for a reasonable $5.60 plus tax. 

I would have given this five stars, but the service was pretty poor. All the same, I still recommend this place over the McDonalds next door."}

{"text":"Fatburger wouldn't be my first choice for lunch.  First of all, the burger is kind of expensive.  Secondly, it's not that great.  Although, it looks delicious.  

When I went in all I wanted was a cheeseburger with the works.  I felt like I was signing up for life insurance.  They kept bombarding me questions.  Just do it right and stop making things so complicated.  It's supposed to be fast food."}
{"text":"This place was ok, the burger was overcooked and dry, the staff was very friendly and helpful, but the prices are ridonkulous for what it is. This is a fast food place with prices of a high end burger joint. Its good in a pinch, but I wouldn't bother again"}
{"text":"So I love the fatburgers in Cali, but this one is 24 hours and has an outdoor bar with misters to beat the LV heat. I ate here twice in 3 days. And even better, you can take your beer down the strip with you. Love this town. Indoor and Outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I ate here probably two to three times a week- veggie burgers only- to the point where the people know my order: last night I tried to order online at around 9:15. After a bit of technical preparation, the site said, 'this restaurant not available online- please call.' I called to order a veggie burger- ahead of time so that it was most convenient for me & the workers. Someone speaking almost no English answered. I said I wanted to order- he asked someone: 'Do you want to  take an order?' She said, 'no,' then came to the phone. I started to order- she said, 'will you be here within ten minutes?' (I would have been). 'Because it's 9:42 & we're not supposed to take phone orders.' 'Its 9:36 & you close at 10.' 'We go by the work clock, which says 9:42.' Are you kidding me? You go by a fantasy time about when you prepare to be closed? (I didn't say this- I thought this). I hung up - wrote a letter to corporate & I vow to take my business elsewhere. Where is pride in serving customers? By the way, this is the second time this branch closed early. They have deterred a great customer!"}
{"text":"Ordered on Skip the dishes, worst Fatburger ever.  Charged for cheese didn't get cheese.  Burger arrived squished.  Onion rings cold.  Chilly cheese frys cold and leaking out of the cardboard container all over the bag.  Usually I like Fatburger, not today!  Two items not delivered with the order, I paid for the items but have to wait 5 to 7 days for the refund, is that fair?"}
{"text":"2/22/2017 I had passed this location for a long time and finally decided to try Fatburger.  I had never eaten at this chain before.  I arrived about 10:30am and ordered the smallest of burgers (a fatburger) an order of fries and a small coke.  While waiting for my order they were playing oldies on the speakers and I listened to an Old Freddie Fender song amoung other oldies which I enjoyed.  My order with tax was $11.56 !!!  The burger was fresh and tasty but in a city like Las Vegas where you can eat at a Buffet for $9.99 I thought the burger was way overpriced.  I did think  the fries were nothing special and had a refill on my Coke.  The ketchup dispenser was empty and had to notify the staff so I could have some with my fries. The only way I would eat at this chain again would be if they offered 1/2 off their burgers.  They  did bring my order to my table which I thought was a nice customer benefit."}
{"text":"I took the XXXL Challenge & Won!
Vina was our counter person! I was starving after not eating in 24 hours! And I had a few drinks in my system. Good combination as it prepared me to meet & exceed the XXXL Challenge with bacon! 
1.5 pounds of beef ... The burger was delicious..  The service was great! The fries should stay hotter longer and come out to your meal when they are at the peak of freshness! My son & I spent $45.00 including a tip. He is 10! We like to eat! That was an expensive burger meal! But Damn good!"}
{"text":"They need to change their name to slow burger. It took 20 minutes to get our food and they forgot our shakes. Then it took another 10 minutes to get the shakes. They were stingy with the mayo on the burger, and did not serve the food in the order that it was placed.  You couldn't even understand the guy that was yelling out the names to pick up the order, and we had to keep going up to the counter to see if it was us that he was calling. They definitely need to switch to a number system. I would rather eat food from a gas station then to eat at Fatburger ever again."}
{"text":"One of the better burger places I've been to in general. The interior was decent seem like any other typical burger joint would look like nothing really special on how the interior looks.

What really is good is the burger now that thing is amazing. I got the XXXL burger which was the biggest size they offer. With 3 meat patties and ton of condiments and cheese in-between whats not to like about this burger(that's coming from the fat kid that's inside me). Either way it was amazing had this nice juicy burger and will fill you up especially the XXXL burger and the sweet potato fried are the real deal as well.

Only thing that bummed me out was that i finished the XXXl burger and in the back i noticed they have like a wall for people that finished that burger. I wished someone would of told me so i could of gotten on that wall and also a certificate on it. But oo well i guess =\

Over great place, now what are you wating for go give it a try yourself."}
{"text":"Hamburgers! The cornerstone of a nutritious breakfast.

I won at the casino so I figured, why not enjoy the offerings of yet another burger chain that we do not have where I come from? 

I don't like orange cheese so I was happy to see that unlike most semi-fast food establishments where you have to sign a waiver to opt out of the cheese on the burger, here, you have to ASK for it if you want it. That \"cheese by default\" sh*t rubs me the wrong damn way. F*ck you, Wisconsin!

So, they serve up a tasty burger without cheese, and with all the standard toppings it hit the spot. The fries were decent but nothing special. Mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Might put a small dent in your wallet, but if your in las Vegas your not going to mind too much!  Ask for cheese!"}
{"text":"Love me a fatburger! And a fatburger at Fatburger is even better...Fresh made, has that kind of diner style element to it. It's good stuff!"}
{"text":"I seriously question the credibility of many of the reviews, the place can't possibly be dirty if there are no customers. Having said that. I ordered 1 large burger at a cost of $8+, and it was not worth it on any measure. From my perspective, this will be a franchise purchase that will not end well.  If the manager would be so kind as to contact me and reimburse me for the cost of my burger, I would be most appreciative.

Many fond memories of the burgers at the Sunset location; this location bears no resemblance.

Avoid."}

{"text":"I haven't been to Fatburger in a while and this was my 1st time to visit this location.  I'm a fan of Fatburger, but not this location.  Here's why.

FOOD - 4 Stars
I was prepared to give this place a 4 Star rating.  I noticed a new menu since my last visit to a Fatburger and ordered a XXL with all of the toppings & added Bacon & Cheese.  For a side, I ordered the Skinny Fries.

After a 15 minute wait, I received my food.  To my surprise, the Burger was HUGE!  I should have paid more attention to the menu because this monster was more than I expected.....I guess I should have ordered a XL.

I attacked the Burger and the Fatburger taste that I grew up with was still there.  The sharp flavor from the Mustard Relish and the Onions generated an explosion on my taste buds.  The Bacon was a nice addition and the Cheese was gooey and made it just right.  The Skinny Fries were just ok.

Overall, the meal was awesome.....now, this is where it went from 4 Stars to 1 Star.....I went to the restroom to wash up since the Burger was pretty messy.  When I got to the restroom I was appalled at how disgusting it was.  It was worse than a Gas Station Bathroom.  The kicker was when I saw that the paper towels to wipe your hands were on top of the toilet.....what's the point of washing your hands when you're about to wipe it on towels that are contaminated from the toilet?!!!  

See the pics I uploaded for details....you'll notice the brown paper towels sitting on top of the toilet tank and that the spot on the wall where the dispenser is suppose to be mounted has spots where plaster was used to cover up the holes...the hand towels are almost touching the toilet seat!!!  ....someone must have pulled it off the wall....but they're not going to replace it?  My issue with this is that is the same bathroom where the employees wash their hands.....gross.  To be fair, I've sent an email to their corporate office to make them aware of this situation....it can't be up to code...can it?  I hope not.

Will I return?  Not until they fix the issue with the hand towels."}
{"text":"Very tasty burger! Well presented. I had the chili burger, and my daughter had the Turkey burger. I also had the vanilla milkshake, (I would NOT recommend the vanilla milkshake, not good to us at all, as it had a strong aftertaste).

One of the better burgers I have had in this city. Funny thing: we love pickles on our burger and we usually order extra, however the pickles on this burger tasted bitter to us. Odd, but we loved the burger and although over priced, we would go back."}
{"text":"You would think that the 'Fat' in their name would scare folks away, but such is not the case with this joint.  I had been meaning to try it for some time and finally got the chance for lunch during a highly depressing weekend that saw me working instead of getting up to my usual crazy shenanigans.  

The cashier was a very pleasant and polite woman that took my order and with a call to the back, had it in motion.  I was particularly hungry so I went for a double burger with cheese and bacon and a side of fries.  I was happy to see that the kitchen was open concept and looked immaculately clean.  A few minutes later, the disk that was given to me started dancing on the table so I knew that my order was ready.

I must say that the presentation was nice, the burger swelling with meaty goodness and the fries a perfect golden brown, but the flavour wasn't really there.  The burger itself was a bit bland and the fries lacked the basic salt for seasoning.  It's quite a shame as I expected it to be a step above your typical fast food, but alas dear Fatburger, you don't truly distinguish yourself from an A&W."}
{"text":"I've been living out of state for the past two years and was looking forward to having a turkey burger here at Fatburger, as well as some indulgent fat fries. The turkey burger patty was just not a texture that was pleasant, far too mushy and way salty. Then the whole wheat bun was dry and they didn't toast it as I've had it always in the past. It was a total disappointment and when I went to the counter to get something they'd forgotten on my order I saw the cook preparing someone else's burger and his technique was to put the bun on top of the cooking patty rather than toasting. That explained why my whole wheat bun was dry and falling apart and my husbands was the same on his regular burger. Cardinal sin in my book not to toast the freakin buns! Fat fries were floppy and undercooked and as I peruse the other reviews here I see that's an ongoing issue. Will drive to another location next time for my burger."}

{"text":"Good concept and nice menu set up, just wish the quality of the food had been a little better. The burgers were alright but nothing special. They were a bit dry and not too flavorful but the toppings I picked helped make up for it. I topped my medium sized burger with cheese, bacon, an egg, and the obligate onions/lettuce/mayo combo. I absolutely LOVE getting a fried egg on my burger because it adds a nice rich creaminess to the experience. I was underwhelmed with the toppings offered but the standards they do offer (and the fried egg, of course) will be enough for most people. 

I tried their skinny fries but felt they were bland and boring, and I wasn't into their super thick onion rings either. If I were to go to Fatburger again I'd probably try their dogs or chicken sandwiches just to see how they stack up but I think if you're in a pinch and hungry late at night while passing by, it would be worth it to grab something here.

Though you are in Vegas, so if you're not too intoxicated or tired to walk a little farther then you'll probably find better options within a block."}
{"text":"Super unprofessional was waiting in the drive through and after 5 minutes of no one answering i drove around and see both employees just sitting down not working. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Drove through fat burger today at about 2:30 PM and repeated the order at the speaker  five times - Fatburger no relish no tomato no cheese no mustard . She kept repeating it back incorrectly. So we drove to the window and had to repeat the order three more times... And when she repeated it back she said no lettuce no mayo, add cheese and bacon! Finally cancelled order and left. Her version of what we were ordering was so convoluted  that we thought maybe we were on candid camera. They were not busy at all. And you expect a raise to $15/hour next year?  Give me a break!  What a joke."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I just sat down to eat, I was craving a turkey burger, so I thought this would do the trick. So I order, and go to wash my hands, this bathroom was so disgusting, I've been in cleaner gas stations than this. Graffiti on the diaper changer thing, the floor was repulsive and I won't even speak about the toilet. As I come out to find a table, I notice all the tables are dirty, and the seats. I'm starting to lose my appetite. Since the grill is open I'm trying to asses the situation behind the counter to see how dirty things are. Should I stay or should I go now? Ask for my money back and leave? Ugh decisions. 

I decide what doesn't kill you makes you stronger (I was really hungry) and I gave the turkey burger a try. Was pretty tasty.   

The ambiance, not so much, between the thoughts of a dirty restaurant, and the guy behind the counter making burgers singing mariachi music, and the day workers in the home depot parking lot, I'm positive I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 med burger meals and it took 30 minutes to prepare the staff is extremely unfriendly and could care less about service or quality.  The casino knows they have captive audience."}
{"text":"Save your self 10-30 minutes of your life and do NOT come here. The only pro is that they make the burgers fresh, which takes 10 minutes. The fries are not even worth mentioning I could bake fries in the oven better than their fries. Our burgers came out completely wrong. To the point where I had to physically write out my order so they could try to get it correct. And they failed a second time in getting my order correct. That's 20 plus minutes of waiting for a sub par burger that wasn't even the correct specifications."}
{"text":"Always a burger favorite! Good juicy burgers with all the favorite trimmings!! Oreo cookie shakes are a favorite as well! Soooooo much better than In n Out!"}
{"text":"JUST HORRIBLE. I'm waiting on a simple order and I ordered it at 9:45pm and they told me it'll be ready in about 10-12 minutes. Mind you there was one other person in line who was BEHIND me and she received her order before mine and they still got her order wrong. They messed up one of my burgers so it had to be remade. Oh btw, I'm working for postmates so this is a delivery order and it's going on 20-25 minutes now when there is NO OTHER FREAKING ORDER BESIDES MINE! They should really consider hiring new employees because all I see is just workers standing around with their thumbs up their rear end with faces full of attitude. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! So after waiting 25 minutes I got fed up and went to the counter and the freaking food was just sitting there and they could care less."}
{"text":"Service was good. They have little devices that light up when your order is ready - which is nice so you can sit and wait. Food is average for a burger joint. Fries have no salt either - you'll have to ask for some..."}

{"text":"Wish I could give this location-5 stars. Order took 25 mins to be ready, once given order was wrong, waited another 15 for the correct order, only to have taken 3bites and felt sick to my stomach because the cheese was bad and it was the wrong cheese anyway! Super slow, horrible food. RIP Fatburger it was nice while it lasted."}

{"text":"I would give this place a better rating but something really bothers me about this location. First off with the good. I've been there three times and each visit the employees were nice and helpful, no issues there at all. I'm a vegetarian and have visited this location specifically for the impossible meats burger, soooo good. Here's the part that bugs me. The drive-through menu board is cracked, missing parts, menu items covered up with paper and other parts being held together with tape. I know this may not seem like a big deal, but the GM and or owner must not care at all about maintenance which makes me wonder if there's also issues in the kitchen. If a business owner is ok with this kind of thing, my guess is that they really don't care much about your safety either. I've attached a couple of photos to show what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Great burgers but PerrFect onion rings!  It's a mandatory stop while in Vegas now--just for the rings = )"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. i visited here after a less than pleasant trip to the dennys up the block and was completely satisfied. my husband hat the fatburger and i had the chicked sandwich both were delicious my favorite was the seak fries omggggg so fresh and crispy just how i like it. they are open very late when most businesses have closed and even for a late night the service was great. i loved that when you put a ti in the tip jar the server yelled fat tip and the entire staff turns around and yells Thank you ! lol super cute. anyway the cookies were just a s amazing as the food. the service was fast the food was good and definitely hit that late night craving. Im a fan!"}
{"text":"its adjacent to the mcdonalds....i kinda imagine the two establishment's employees having switchblade knife fights around sunrise when everybody on the strip is asleep.  i'm pretty sure they are hardcore, because the cashier was telling his life story [or hitting on?] to my girlfriend.  i won't minus any stars for that though.  cuz i know who she's leaving with.  mwuhahaha.

butchyeah.  that paragraph had nothing to do with why i'm giving this place 5 stars.  it's a delicious NON-OVERPRICED turkey burger + onion rings for ~ $7.  WILL I COME BACK?  HELL YES."}
{"text":"If this Fatburger weren't so inconviently placed for drunken stumbles, then the owner would be a gazillionaire.  
Bottom line, this is good food.  Drunk, it turns a bit better.  When you realize that you're drunk in VEGAS, eating a fat burger, it's a 5-star performance.  
But it still runs a 4 with me."}
{"text":"Fatburger in general is great. I love sweet relish on a burger. This location is inside Texas Station so, it's a little different. The manager seemed stressed and it wasn't that busy. I ordered a cheeseburger with all the condiments and no bun and, got no condiments and no cheese. When I mentioned it, the manager gave me a side of cold, shredded cheese. *Shrug* The meat was WAY overcooked. The milkshake was perfect. Everything was clean and all the employees were nice."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever eaten... Ever! We went there for lunch at the beginning of our weekend trip and HAD to go there again before we left Las Vegas!! The staff was really nice too!

I would recommend getting the \"skinny fries\" unless you like steak cut fries."}
{"text":"We come here about twice a month. It's always clean and not overly packed like some of the other ones. I do wish they had a drive thru though, but I understand why they don't. Everything is cooked to order, so it's fresh all the time. And I love the fact that they have a jukebox."}
{"text":"The staff didn't understand what gluten-free was and didn't keep my gluten free food separate from the regular food I ordered for my friends even though I specifically instructed them to when I ordered. Then the staff that bagged my food gave me attitude. I don't live in Vegas but if I did I certainly would make a point not to eat at this store location. They are obviously a different franchise owner than the good ones I'm used to in Los Angeles that care about their customers. I know they aren't connected because they wouldn't punch a punch card either."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food. The curly fries with original spice, California veggy burger, Oreo shake and cheeseburgers. Wow, delicious!  Good presentation, and excellent flavour. Nice decor, but very limited seating. If this was more of a sit down restaurant, like red robin or Jonny rockets, then this would be clear 5 star for me. Will certainly return."}
{"text":"So, I work in a restaurant that sells $18 burgers.  And for some reason, the burger and onion rings I got here rivaled mine.  And we're talking brisket/chuck, freshly ground for my place.  How did Fatburger beat me?  Because they're bad ass...  Load up your burger, mushrooms, bacon, all that good stuff.  Get the rings.  And be happy."}
{"text":"We waited a half hour for fries for our kids. They had actually forgotten about us because my husband ordered a milkshake. Since he had the milkshake they assumed they were done with the order. When I finally alerted them about how long we'd been waiting they put in a fresh batch of fries for us. Which is normally good unless you want to feed them to a 4 and 2 year old who have been waiting half an hour for their dinner. The workers here also seemed to be working in slow motion despite the fact that they were very busy. Very frustrating experience."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre, and employees need to be more friendly. We had to use the restroom and the employee told us to wait and go around with a rude tone. We got our order wrong twice, when we finaally got what we ordered they over did the sauce on the hot wings."}
{"text":"This review is centered specifically on Fatburger's outside \"yard long\" alcoholic beverages. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, there is next to NO ALCOHOL IN THEM. For $30 bucks you're supposed to get around 6 shots or alcohol in a 50oz cup, but all you'll get is a sugar headache. My wife and I got one each to start out out Vegas Strip night, but after finishing my entire drink I could hardly feel anything. SCAM ALERT!"}
{"text":"I normally do not give one stars reviews, I know what it takes to be in hospitality business. But this experience deserves a one star, 
Late night hunger took us to the only outlet open in Red Rock food court.
We ordered the chicken sandwich and wrap with water.
Both the products were below avg taste, the mayo they use is either sub-standard or just lost its punch - maybe closer to expiry of product. 
But could be a pass but finding a human hair marinated in the Chicken patty, is not acceptable. Yuck - Killed our meal. The manager was shocked too and truly apologetic, offering to replace our meal 
We were done, never trust this brand again for quality.
If you do have to go to this brand, please check your meal"}
{"text":"Groupon bought me here today.  $16 deal; two burgers with fries.  This place is more than a burger joint.  They have wings, poutine and even beer.  We ordered and found a seat.  They bought us our drinks and then the food right to our table.  Great service!  They even came over twice and asked how was the food.  So attentive!! The bun had a crispy crust and a soft interior.  The patty was a bit dry though.  Their iced cap is the best; it's rich and the coffee flavor lasted to the very last sip.  I will come back to try their wings,poutine and have the iced cap again!! Solid five stars for the iced cap and service.  2 stars for the burger."}
{"text":"The food is just ok.
The burgers are really salty & greasy. Other than the salt, there is no flavor.
The fries are salty too.
On the plus side, the service is good. The employees walk by & ask you how is everything."}
{"text":"Fat burger is not the same as it once was. This is what happens when the company becomes larger and doesn't care about it's customers. The waitress at the Fat burger bar was rude. The bun on my burger was hard. I overheard the manager Jeremy address my concern with the waitress. She became rude and disrespectful to him. Oh well to her improving her service to customers."}
{"text":"The most awesome thing about this Fatburger is that they open 24 hours. We got hungry once at 2:30 am and decided to walk there. My 1st experience there's funny. When I walked in, I was greeted with non-stop rap songs. Also, there are so many ghetto people in there too, all shady looking. I thought we're gonna get robbed, shot or something lol.

The burger itself is really greasy. You can order the size you want (from S - XXXL) and can pay extra for additional cool toppings, such as chilli and fried egg (I'd recommend these). The burger comes with mustard, mayo, relish, shredded lettuce & tomatoes. The burger as a whole's pretty good. I like the toppings that they put in there.

Conclusion: The burger's pretty good. About the same with 5 guys, but definitely can't beat In-N-Out."}
{"text":"These people do not understand english. They got my order totally wrong and it wasn't worth trying to communicate their mistake. Will never come back to frustrating."}
{"text":"Never tried a fat burger til I wen there.

even in  the AM, there was a line.  Price was above normal range for me."}
{"text":"I liked the food. The fries at least. They were selling the huge liquor horns. Bangin! I had a cold but that aint stop me! Once again, on the strip. Crowded but you wont be waiting forever."}
{"text":"I've had multiple bad experiences at this Fat Burger not only do they take forever but they gave me my food uncooked and when I complained they told me they would replace my meal when I came back to get it the manager at the time Francisco refused to give it to me saying that the guy who told me he would replace my food was fired and that I had to repay for it, he was Completely rude and unprofessional and I would never again support this business"}
{"text":"They have hot dogs here!  Perfect for the kids. Burgers are good too.  Fatburger is located at the food court inside the Red Rock Casino.  They recently  took over Johnny Rockets.

Convenient to get the kids a quick bite before going in to see a movie."}
{"text":"Crazy expensive.....medium bacon cheese burger meal-  12.00
2 people running the whole store..... 15-20 minute wait.
Food.....meh?

Freddies steakburgers.....best value around !"}
{"text":"LOVE IT and they make the burgers fresh... beef, turkey, veggie or even breaded chicken sandwiches.  Also, I was lucky enough to have the last week of their limited time Peanut Butter shakes made with Nutter Butters... LOVE IT.  It's called Fatburger, so don't complain they were greasy or whatever.  Enjoy it."}
{"text":"Great burger. One of the best fast food burgers I've ever had, right behind 5 guys."}
{"text":"i came here every day for lunch and or dinner.  no burger joint in America Competes with this place.  i have moved 10 states and 87 moves.  this is the best of the best."}
{"text":"While out shopping need something to settle the alcohol that I was consuming. It has been too long since I indulged in a Fat Burger. The food here even though it is considered fast food is amazing. I am waiting for my fat burger now and enjoying a little people watching here in the lobby of the LV strip. 

This location is convenient to so many restaurants in this immediate area. It is fairly busy too. The lobby is not crowded most seem to order and then enjoy their burgers on the go or at the bar. Their is a shady area for guests to enjoy their food outside. It needs a better way to keep it cool but some guests might enjoy the umbrella shade even on our 100 plus degree summer days.

The cashier was pleasant and friendly and took my order with no issues. While waiting for my food the only issue that came up was the fact that they do not have ice cold air conditioning for the guests. The skinny burger that I ordered hit the spot too. Plus it was less calories than the larger burger too!"}
{"text":"Nothing compared to Los Angeles or Santa Barbra's locations.  Had a friend with me who lives in Vegas an mentioned as should have sent to the ShAke shack.  Our hamburgers were dry, no flavor or seasoning was used.  Ordered chili cheese frys also an they sucked.  Many drunk people in there so I'm sure they thought it was good :) the soda fountains Coke was watered down maybe the bib for the syrup was empty.  Flew from Hawaii an was excited to try this place out yet I was disappointed."}
{"text":"When it comes to FF burgers, everyone has their preferences.  With me, it comes down to mood, location, convenience, price, and service.  Mood usually dominates my decision.  However, my most recent visit to Fatburger wasn't due to mood. It was due to convenience and location. It was late night at the Red Rock Casino.  My choices were very limited, especially since I needed something with no carbs, a high protein count, and quick.  Fatburger was my only choice.  

Now it came to decision on what burger was I going to order.  The XXXL is way to big and the Large seemed too small.  I ended up with the XXL.  Since I wasn't eating the bun during this visit, I knew I could handle all of the 16 oz's that the XXL has to offer.  Their burgers are known for their seasoning and a healthy spread of their pickled mustard.  Sometimes their burgers are a bit dry.  That's where the condiments and bun come to play.  Without them, you will really notice how dry their burgers really are.  

What sets Fatburger from the rest is what I call their \"Breakaway Meat\".  The burgers at Fatburger are not compressed/packed patties causing them to break apart in your mouth.  I like it since it's different, the seasoning gets inside the meat better, and you feel the texture of a good burger in your mouth.  What would be perfect is their burger meat on top of rice.  Almost like a Loco Moco minus the egg and gravy. Bottom line, good burger that hit the spot for what I was looking for last night. 

The service was as good as it gets.  My only issue, which is not Fatburger's fault, was that the food court was dirty.  Tons of trash and tables needed to be wiped down.  I ended up eating at their counter because of this.  

I didn't have their fries, shakes, and even their bun on last night's visit.  I will be back to eat here the traditional way and update my review. 

TIP:
-You get big portions of meat in your burger and you decide what size you want. S, M, L (8 oz) , XXL (16oz), and XXXL (24 oz)."}
{"text":"Large burgers, joyous for very late nights."}
{"text":"If you want to pay a buck for a cheeseburger that is ready before you finish paying, there is probably a McDonald's somewhere nearby that you can go to. If you want a quality burger and can handle a 10 minute wait, Fatburger may be right up your alley. 

I was in the area to do some shopping, and I had told my honey I'd bring some food home for him, so I decided to go through the drive-thru at this Fatburger location... I ordered a large for him without cheese, small for me with cheese, both without onion. And two orders of those fabulous salt-free steak fries. The fries are really what sets Fatburger apart for me... Always cooked perfect and no sodium overload. 

I sat in my car for almost 10 minutes while I waited for my order but honestly, if they had handed it to me any faster I would have wondered if it had been sitting under a heat lamp... 

And if you really can't handle the wait, you can call/fax your order in or place an online order..."}
{"text":"Santa Fe Station Casino has a couple of good food options.  My favorites include the Oyster Bar and Charcoal Room.  But when I'm behind on my meals and need something quick, sometimes the food court is my only option.  I was looking for something that was high in protein and very, very high in fat.  Fatburger was the only place that fit these requirements.  I got their XXL Burger w/cheese.  It's only 8 oz., but still big enough to keep me satiated for at least 2 hours. Fatburger doesn't use frozen patties, only the fresh stuff.  I skipped the fries and eventually dumped the bun.  I got my burger and it was one fried mess.  I was surprised that it was actually pretty good.  The burger satisfied my gut and gave me the nutrients that I was looking for. 
The service was better than average.  The cashier did a great job taking my money, handing me my change, and giving me a receipt.  By the way, the meal is free if they fail to give you a receipt.  The cook was very efficient and cooked my burger in less than 10 minutes.  Overall, I can't say I'm a huge fan.  The burger did its purpose.  

2017 Yelp Review #75"}
{"text":"I love Fatburger because if the options provided. Not in the mood for a huge burger? That's ok, you can get a baby Fatburger, it's just big enough. Trying to eat healthy? Fatburger offers chicken sandwiches, salads and turkey burgers. 

My favorite thing at Fatburger is the fries though. I always get Fat Fries which are steak cut fries. I love that Fatburger makes their fries without salt, no sodium overload here! 

My husband wanted Fatburger the other day for dinner and this location (inside the Fiesta Henderson Casino) is the closest to our house. I wasn't thrilled about going to a casino to pick up dinner but the people working at this Fatburger did their job quickly enough to get me in and out in about 10 minutes with everything made just how I wanted it... 

The Maui-Banana Shake is amazing."}
{"text":"I have no problem with the prices at Fatburger because every time I have eaten there, I can tell that the food is of higher quality then the places where you can get a burger for a buck.... As with many things in life, when it comes to burgers usually you get what you pay for. 

Burger patties are cooked to order, so there will be a wait if you don't call ahead. I was at the mall, across the street from Sunset Station (where this Fatburger is located) when I called in my order. By the time I drove across the street, parked and made my way through the casino my order was just being finished...

The employee that helped me looked like he wasn't a day over 12, but he was friendly and he didn't forget the ketchup so I can't complain about the service! Overall this Fatburger is a-ok."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Fatburger, I've eaten at a few of the different locations around town. This review won't include any whining about prices, it is what it is and you get what you pay for... Frankly if the price is too steep for some people they should just turn around and head down the street to Micky D's or something else they feel is worth the cost...

The issue I have with this location is the service. Yes, Fatburger can be considered fast food so it's foolish to expect much in the way of service. Employees should still be cheery and helpful, and the one that brought our food out was not. She just slapped a pile of trays with all 4 orders on the top one down on the edge of the table and walked away. I'd be more understanding if the place was busy but it was not. I also do not understand why each person's order was not on it's own tray. 

The same employee was less-then-helpful when I informed her that their tea dispenser was out of tea. She told me it was not and that I needed to push the button... which I had done, and nothing but water came out. She then told her coworker that they should check the tea, and walked out the door for her break... 

Like I said, I am not going to bitch about the higher-then-your-typical-fast-food-joint prices, but I will say that if you are going to charge those higher prices your should make sure the people you have taking the money and delivering the product are at least somewhat pleasent to deal with."}

{"text":"I've been to Fatburger twice.  My first experience was no good.  My husband made me get the XL (with two patties, i think) and I wanted to throw up.  I was pregnant and the look of it made me sick.

BUT...I went to Fatburger again last weekend and it was really good!  It really hit the spot after a day of shopping with the girls.  I'm a burger and fries kinda girl!  Skinney fries were delish!"}

{"text":"Went tonight after going to this location tons of times. Always consistant. Tonight they were poorly staffed with only three people working and two of them on their first day. The woman who took our order was missing at least two teeth. It was disgusting. I cant believe they would have her greet people. She did not look sanitary at all. My husband got the XXL which he always gets. It was off. They loaded it with mayo. They never do that. He heard them ask what the order of condiments was supposed to be when she was making the burger. She also complained loudly that it was too hot! Just make our burger and quit bitching loudly. it was really off tonight."}

{"text":"I love Fatburger and this location is one of the best in town. Yes, it is located in the Green Valley Ranch casino food court but it is open 24 hours. I'll grab a quick meal here before or after a movie or a late night snack after bowling. 

The guys at this Fatburger know how to cook! I usually get an XXL (double cheeseburger) with grilled onions, pickles and all-beef chili. I'm a low carber so I'll get it served in a dish with no bun. I love the beef here and I love how it is cooked in all of its own delicious burger grease. Sit at the counter and talk to the cooks while they prepare your dinner, and order a soda that you can keep refilling yourself at the self-service soda bar (wish they would add Coke Zero since I'm not a Diet Coke fan).

I love Fatburger's handmade milkshakes too (and their skinny and fat fries) but I've had to give those up due to all the carbs. But if you can, try their skinny chili cheese fries, they are the best. They melt shredded cheddar on them which is the key to good cheese fries. There are also a long list of possible toppings you can get on your Fatburger from relish to fried eggs to bacon and grilled onions. They also make grilled chicken and veggie burgers too, and both are good. You can also get your burger on a whole wheat bun or wrapped in lettuce.

Everything is cooked to order here so once you order you are given a number. They'll deliver the food to your table. Plan on spending about $25 for 2 people; it's not exactly cheap but it's convenient and the food is always fresh, hot, and served with a smile. And if you are a gambler at Station Casinos, you can even redeem your comp dollars here and eat for free."}

{"text":"I like Fatburger. Their ingredients are of a higher quality than most quick service burger joints, they have Coke Zero on tap at their all you can drink soda fountain, they are open 24 hours and I like my meat well done. It's a win-win situation for me. This location is inside the Sunset Station casino, making it a great place for a late night snack or a quick dinner before catching a movie. The prices are higher than other spots (it's in a casino with a captive audience, people!) but I think the value is still there. What other burger places do you know that have Grey Poupon mustard, swiss cheese, chili, fried egg and relish as toppings? You'll pay extra for the premium add-ons but it's worth it (bonus tip: order a side BOWL of chili for a few extra bucks; you'll get 10 times the amount you'd get if you just order a scoop on top of your burger). Plenty of seating and always open."}

Second I asked for two large and two mediums and she gave me all mediums.
Third when I got home I was missing my fries.
That's why I hate drive through"}
{"text":"It took 30min to get my damn burger!!!  And when i got it, the burger was cold and the bun was hard and stale. WTF??!!!"}
{"text":"Though a bit pricey with not a lot of options, their burgers are juicy and delicious. It's a higher quality, thicker patty on a well made (though not in-house) bun. I get mine with just lettuce, mayo and cheese but you can get it loaded with toppings for the same price. I also got skinny fries but there are also a lot of fry/side options including steak fries, onion rings, or a salad. 
If you got a little extra to spend but still want a fast burger, Fatburger is the place to go."}
{"text":"A decent burger place.
If in the area I'd probably go back for another shot.

The burger was a good size and well prepared, no complaints there.  Might even have rated another 1/2 star for that.  But the fries... some of them were uncooked.  They had zero colour to them at all.  You gotta cook the fries.

Also, the cashier started things off with a pet peeve of mine.  Interrupting me mid order to ask if I wanted a combo.  Just listen until I finish and at that point if I haven't ordered fries and a drink you can ask if I want a combo... But that is a small thing, so I did not deduct anything for what is a personal gripe."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a burger...on a Tuesday at 3pm...no one in line. Enough said."}
{"text":"This one is inside the Red Rock Casino Food Court. Very nice staff who asked me if I was seeing a movie and gave me a 10% discount because of that.   So if you're coming here, grab your ticket first and then order to save yourself some dough. 

The burger came out promptly and was great too - as usual. I like mine with everything on it but you have a choice to pick and choose what you want on yours. 

A value for your money!"}
{"text":"The food is good, always. The main reason for this 5 star review is for the two gentleman who were working on 7/15 (they both had tattoos I believe, one had an eyebrow piercing). Their attitudes were so good, they were super sweet too. The A/C wasn't working and were talking to them about it just kind of joking around, they were so humble. I wish I could compliment them more but I really just had short interactions with them. They were amazing!"}
{"text":"This location may be too busy to get some real service.  The last couple of times I've gone my orders have been messed up.  They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right."}
{"text":"Good but overpriced. I spent $30 on myself and 2 kids meals. I can say that now I know the kids meals with chicken strips could be split between them instead of shelling out $8 bucks each. For what I paid it was just enough. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"More than 30 minutes later and they still had not gotten our order out. We asked about it and all hell broke loose.  The cook thought he had been making it over and over again.  Apparently the order had kept going out the drive through window.  So we never got our food and lots of other customers were getting the wrong food.  Will never be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"This was a great burger I will come back soon. It's been a long time since I been to fat burger but I am now a fan again. They are slow but nothing good comes fast. If your looking for fast have a slice of pizza if your looking for a great burger this is the place"}
{"text":"Not very well maintained.  No soap or paper towels in the restroom, there was not even a soap dispenser.  But... there was a sign saying employees must wash hands before returning to work.  I'm not sure how they will manage to do that. Also, literally ever napkin holder every table was empty.  If these obvious things are over looked, it makes me wonder what corners are cut behind the scenes. Go to another location if you can help it."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers with great service. Even tho Fat Burger is a fast food restaurant, they bring the food to your table and ask you how the food is with a smile. I've been to this location a handful of times, tho consistency isn't it's strong suit, I've always left extremely full and satisfied. I have to admit that the last time I went, the service was great but the burgers didn't quite taste as good.

I love it when they top your burger with an onion ring for added texture and they do it here for free yayyyy! The meat is perfectly grilled to be crispy and ohhhhh that perfectly melted cheese.. droool. I would go lighter on the sauce tho that is a personal preference. Buns are just ok, nothing special. The milk shake is quite good - so thick and creamy. You shouldn't come here counting calories but sometimes I order the lettuce wrap to feel less guilty. They give you way too much lettuce compared to the proportion of the meat though, so I end up peeling back some lettuce to eat after I'm done with the burger as a salad lol"}
{"text":"Avoid this location!

30 minutes to mess up an order of 1 burger and fries, nothing else. Worst Fatburger location this side of town. The employees are slow. The food is always cold. Avoid this location and make the trek to Red Rock Casino for a $1 extra for everything if you really need to have Fatburger. Done with this place. I would be firing the whole staff if I was in charge of this loss leader."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a different burger joint from In N Out. I ordered 3 Fatburgers (1 small & 2 medium), 2 fries and 1 onion rings. It cost me about $30 ( TOO EXPENSIVE! ). The small Fatburger was very small similar to a slider burger size. The medium sized burger was a good size but not for $6. The burger had onions, mustard, mayonaisse, relish, pickles, etc. I tasted most of the pickles due to its saltiness. I didn't like their fries at all, it was very bland. But the batter on their onion rings was delicious.

I would choose In N Out than FatBurger next time."}
{"text":"Avoid this location. Just go to the one on sunset. Friendlier staff and they are not drunk on shift.
Short Mexican with a mustache always drunk on shift at this location. 

Just save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"it was Ok, the meat lack some salt or some magic spice (like other places). The place looks kinda crappy but attention is ok. Still I think I'll stick to my carl's...more juicy and tasty"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The customer service is outstanding. Shout out to Carlos! I asked if it was possible to use coke instead of milk to make a blended coke float and when I found out they don't usually do this I said it was ok I'd just take a soda. But Carlos said \"No let's give it a try\". And yes...it came out great! He also realized I was ordering a hamburger patty for my fur baby and remembered to leave off the salt when I had forgotten to request no salt. I wish I knew the name of the young lady that actually made the shake and the cook that came out to bring me my food. He showed me a picture of his pet ( a snake...eek...lol ) when I showed him a picture of my fur daughter, Luna. Of course the food was great also, even Lulu said so . This was a wonderful experience and I will definitely be back. Y'all give them a try!"}
{"text":"First off they have super friendly and fast service. Second they now serve the impossible burger here!!! So if you're vegan in the green valley arena get your butt over here! Fresh and made to order it's the best thing I've had all week."}
{"text":"Mmm... That is a tasty burger. Skip In-N-Out (overrated), come here. And any place that allows you to put a fried egg on your burger is obviously going to be good.

Aside from being the cheapest burger on The Strip (or even the cheapest food), it is just darn fun and good. You hear the workers yelling out orders, it is a small diner-like atmosphere, and the burgers just taste good. Skip the lettuce and tomato and such and opt for egg, onions, bacon, and all the stuff that will slowly kill you as you walk back to your hotel.

And for the little ones -- like my wife who doesn't eat a ton -- they have small burgers that are perfect for little appetites."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

On my getaway day from Las Vegas on 7/23, in advance of my red eye flight that evening, I could not resist some more sessions of video poker at Santa Fe Station. To get me back to the machines quickly I opted for a quick lunch at Fatburger, located in the casino's food court.

A pleasant young woman with a screeching cartoonish voice took my order. She advised me to sit at one of the food court tables and wait eight minutes for a freshly cooked burger. Eight minutes later I heard her scream........my burger was ready. It was a tasty, fresh burger on a typical burger roll. I could not distinguish it from any other fast food burger, although I do give this franchise credit for making fresh burgers to order. The burger did the job and sated my hunger. I did think it was a little overpriced, however.

The most surprising aspect of my visit to Fatburger was the Vanilla Milk Shake I ordered with Whipped Cream. It was outstanding.  It was delicious, with a beautiful consistency. I look forward to enjoying it again!

Thus.....I've added a half star to my review to praise this remarkable shake."}
{"text":"A. Conveniently located, i.e., once you've drank enough floaters at Studio 54, you can walk to this spot
B. Patrons are scary, i.e., bikers, gang-bangers, doped-up homeless dudes
C. Food was made quickly, lots of yelling by Jose and Hector on the deep fryers
D. Burger was like stacked and greasy as hell...the visuals of the girls biting into them while grease was dripping down the side of their mouths was stupendous
E. This place was dirty as hell (it was 4 am so I'm not mad at 'em)

I will hit again."}
{"text":"So when you first walk in, the arrangement is a little weird but once you make your way through the hallway, past the washrooms, you'll see a cheerful all smiley staff waiting to take your order. I, of course, didn't know what to get only having fatburger once before, so after a quick look at the menu, I opted for the fried cod sandwich.

The total came to fifteen dollars! I dished out the sum, but instantly regretted ordering such an expensive sandwich. Although, I must say that fatburger has higher prices than your typical fast food joint. 

The food was good, but not great, especially for fifteen bucks! The cod sandwich was definitely the star of the show. Soft and succulent deep fried fish mmm whats not to love. The sandwich did get a little soggy because of the excess sauce placed on it but its cool, I can live with that. Don't even waste your time on the french fries or the yam fries because they were not salted and couldn't measure up to mcdonalds fries. The coleslaw on the side was tasty, but what I appreciated the most about this joint was that it was meticulously clean (although its a new establishment) and that each table was stocked with burger essentials: napkins, various seasonings, and my favourite, tabasco sauce! They do it right at fatburger! Noticed the exceptional customer service by the way...we were greeted when we walked in and when we left as well as asked how our meal was twice by two different staff members. Great training by the management here! 

Will be back again to sample their other burgers. You can tell this place will soon be a local hotspot...good food, even better service!"}
{"text":"I go to this location about once a week (don't judge me), and I've only had great service every time. The employees are always genuinely friendly and the food is good."}
{"text":"Not clean , floors sticky and the tables are not clean. Smells like sulfur when you walk in. 

Half the lights on the building are out, this store is rundown and needs some TLC. 

FATBURGER used to be worth the $9 burger. Not anymore."}
{"text":"Wow what a great burger.  The place was dirty but it's on the strip in a rundown strip mall surrounded by drunk street urchins and strip-club card-slapping Mexicanos - what do you expect??

If it's 3am and you've been drinking on the strip all night and want to get amazing service, a J Crew-clad crowd, a sparkling clean facility, AND get a great burger at a great price for the strip, GO BACK TO YOUR HOTEL AND GO TO BED b/c you're an idiot.

Oh yeah the food.  Great burgers!  Got a few of the small burgers with cheese each time we went (thrice in three days).  The meat was juicy and not over-cooked, the tomato and onions and lettuce were all fresh and hadn't been sitting out.  Better than IN-N-Out in my opinion and way better than Wendys and way way way way better than McD's."}
{"text":"There are some strong points when it comes to Fatburger. The music, for one, stands out in my mind. They always have good music playing. I like that you can watch your burger being made. It is like the ultimate in quality assurance watching everything the cook does. I like that the burgers are made fresh. There is a certain quality that you can taste in the freshness.  They do make a good burger. I admit that. My main issue with Fatburger is the price. In what world does it make sense to charge $10.99 for a burger, fries and a Coke at a fast food chain restaurant. I can get more food for the same price at a place like Red Robbin. A crazy price like $10.99 steered me away from the combo so I ended up with just a burger for over $6.00.   I guess I shouldn't complain too much though. It forced me to stick with my diet a little bit."}
{"text":"Eh. This is my second time I have eaten at Fat Burger in the 10 years I've lived in Vegas. Nothing special about this place. It's pricey for what you get. I do like that they have the skinny and fat fries since I like one and my husband likes the other. The service at this location was good and the cashier was really nice. Food is ok. I'd take In n Out over Fat Burger."}
{"text":"We have a split house on this one.  Husband loves this place since we had one locally.  He loves the burgers and fries.  I thought it was ok, nothing to write home about....just another burger place."}
{"text":"A little expensive for burgers that are similar to In and Out. Add ins are a buck more so if you add cheese and bacon onto your burger, you already have a burger that is about $10. Their is really nothing special about these burgers other than the name. With all the different flavors and foods that they serve in Las Vegas, Save your money and try something exotic."}
{"text":"You're walking along the strip and you see an attractive woman in a skimpy red bikini on top of a bar, you take notice.  This is in front of the Fat Bar which is the patio portion of Fat Burger.  I'm not reviewing this as part of Fat Bar, because the sign says verbatim \"Welcome to Fatburger's Las Vegas Slushie Bar.\"  I always loved Fat Burger.  It's a big fat burger with fat fries.  Before they came to Reno, I always hit the Fat Burger here like a tradition.  Now, let's get back to what's important.  There are one or two hot women in bikini's in the front hawking over-sized margarita-flavored alcohol slushies.  The Las Vegas strip is super expensive as far as drinking.  I paid $20 for a drink to get into the Haze Night Club (it's free to get in so long as you buy a $20 drink coupon).  That got me a watered down vodka and Coke.  Yuck.  Then I paid $10 for a Sierra NV 12 oz beer.  After $30, I wasn't even close to feeling buzzed.  For $25 (using a $5 coupon) I got 55 oz of slushi strawberry margarita-flavored booze.  I expected it to be watered down a lot, but to my surprise, BANG!  It was LOADED with tequila!  I got drunk immediately.  So be careful.  I later blacked out.  I got the small guitar.  I know, it's totally touristy, but when in Vegas, be a lame tourist and live it up.  Trust me, the guitar gets you attention.  I had women taking photos of me with them and then they'd wear the guitar and get more photos.  Can you say chick magnet?  Too bad I was toasted by then and barely remember the whole ordeal.  None-the-less, the bikini beach bartenders were super friendly, and I'm telling you, there's nothing like drinking 55 oz of booze from a plastic guitar on a public street.  Unfortunately, it was the worst tasting margarita or dacquiri or whatever the hell they want to call it.  It was like pure corn syrup after the ice all melted.  It was hard to drink, but basically it was just a vehicle to help get the tequila down so don't expect craft, natural ingredient juice here.  Just swallow it down and get drunk.  I'm a craft cocktail snob, but this place isn't about craft cocktail numb nuts.  It's about the bikini bartenders, the guitar, and getting wasted on a public street in Vegas, and then blacking out."}
{"text":"Wow.... where do I start?

I've come to this location many times throughout the years, but this was seriously the worst service all the way around and management needs to know about this ASAP!

My husband and I came here for a bite and as soon as we walked in we were met with the most unfriendliest, unprofessional hostile cashier ever. The cashier was visibly annoyed and being rude to the customer at the drive thru and then she rang us up with her personality of a door knob self.

She was loud and disrupting the other workers on the grill, which makes sense why my food tasted like crap. I've always received great service at all the Fat-burgers I've been too but this was a disaster. I'd like to know who in the heck hired this crazy person.

The food was sloppy, warm and lacked in taste. It looks like the cook forgot to add salt to the patties. All together this was by far the very worst I've come across at FB and I don't ever want t o come here again. Yikes!!!"}
{"text":"Its a fun gimmick but, why would I go back here? Its not like there's a paucity of good burger places around. I realized I could stop when I saw that they just had the same place everywhere, and I mean everywhere. Its kind of depressing, especially after you get all clogged with Fatburger. Seriously, give it up. This place isn't that good, just familiar if you are from the west."}
{"text":"This beast is a Triple Kingburger:

I could not finish this damn thing.  It's actually bigger than it looks in the pic, you can't see the depth there.  And you have to chip away at an angle since it won't fit in your mouth.  The cook came out to check on my progress after 20 minutes and just laughed that I wasn't close to done.  

I felt like John Candy in The Great Outdoors at the steakhouse when they tell him he has to eat the fat and gristle too.  Oh and for all you Gen \"Z\"ers or \"Millenials\" with your \"internets\" and \"imacpods\" and \"myfriendspaces\", who are gonna try to make me feel old for referencing John Candy instead of Chris Farley or the fat kid from Superbad, take a lookee here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3Z4OfTr8ww&amp;feature=related

It's a very good thing, but damn, that's a lot of meat.

Fatburger is great because they're open 24/7 and they're right there just north of the MGM on the Strip.  So at 1 am when you and all your drunk buddies are realizing how many empty calories are in half a bottle of vodka, and that all the good restaurants in Vegas close at 10 or 11, you know where to go.  Sure it gets messy in there but you're too drunk or hungry to care right?  

And you don't really want McDonald's do ya?  No.  No, you don't.

Oh yeah and props to Eli G for the burger inspiration, this guy lives and breathes the carnivore lifestyle:

{"text":"I found everything to be mediocre. I ordered a large bacoj cheeseburger with fat fries and a soda. Came to $20 even.

The burger was just OK. Cooked in a lot of butter or lard or something to make it crispy. The fries tasted fried from frozen and highly processed.  Overall, you can do better at Shake Shack for a greasy burger fill."}
{"text":"Service is very slow, I received my milkshake in the drive-through and my milkshake is almost gone before I've even receive my food. Also everything is WAY overpriced, tastes good but I might as well have gone to a sit down restaurant for what this was worth. Paid $17 for a 1/3lb burger meal smdh"}
{"text":"I personally enjoyed In and Out much more than Fatburger. Fatburger is your more greasy, down to earth, bar food type of burger. Nothing too special about it, although they do offer ginormous portions, and give you an option to add a fried egg.  I was not very fond of the wedge fries, got to sample the shoe strings and onion rings, both which taste better. The location is great if you are staying around the strip, about a 5 min walk from planet hollywood."}
{"text":"Fresh burger cooked to order. It cost a little more but if you like more meat, it's worth it.. The meat is fresh and bigger than the bun. You get to choose which condiments you want on your burger when ordering. The best burger I had around in Vegas"}

{"text":"Nice surprise. We needed breakfast, and it was 10:30 so no luck at McD's. Stopped here and were so happy we did. 

Margarita greeted us, took our order and then cooked our food to order. We ordered sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. You get two giant sausage patties which are super hot since they come right off the grill. 

Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Eat here every time I'm in Vegas and love it.  Service has always been great and so has the food.  Expect to pay twice as much as In and Out.  Love the new renovations with the bar outside, it worked perfect for my son (17) and I so we could people watch on the strip and I could have a beer without the hassle of his age.  I love In and Out and Fuddruckers also but this is a different type of burger joint.  Can't wait til the next trip!"}

{"text":"Upon my arrival at this fat burger location I noticed the \"Open\" sign was on but was greeted in the drive thru with a very unpleasant experience.  The voice I hear is a woman but didn't catch the name. Almost a half hour before closing I am told there is no more orders to be taken because someone right in front of me had placed an order of approximately $200 and they wouldn't have time to make my order.  All I had tried to order was fat fries. Never have I ever been told that I couldn't place an order because someone before me purchased a high volume of items on the menu, especially at a fast food place.  She wasn't kind speaking through the speaker, quick to dismiss  and definitely wasn't very accommodating. My recommendation would be to get staff more qualified to take a high volume of orders or shouldn't have an \"Open\" sign on if they can not serve food a half hour before closing. I love that this place has a drive thru but safe to say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here once for your curiosity and once because I was dragged here. Fat burger is mediocre at best. Its overpriced and takes wayyyy too long to get your food.

Be brave. Order the XXXL burger and bust a gut!
Also, don't be scared of the locals that hangout there.

{"text":"My first mission with the GTA Burger Brigade and I think that I completed the objectives of filling up my belly with burger-y goodness!  Located in Thornhill, across from the Promenade Mall in the newer complex of business, Fatburger is located on the corner of the building facing the west.  Lots of ample parking.  The restaurant has a small footprint, but is more long than wide.  About a 25 seat eating area, ample enough for a small group.  The menu is quite extensive..not just beef burgers..but chicken, turkery,vegetarian options also salads as well.  They also have a variety of different french fry options, ranging from different topped french fries, yam fries and the Large Bag O' Fries (which I have not tried, but it is on the list).  Not like your regular burger joint, when they take your order..you tell them all the toppings you want and you are given a number and they will deliver your burger to you wherever you are sitting in the restaurant.  This way it keeps the line up at the cash moving, so that there isn't a line up of people waiting for food.  A great idea!! The service was fast and friendly and the staff was always helpful to explain all the options.  I sat in the dining area and they brought my meal in about 8-10 min.   I ordered the Double Kingburger..which consisted of 2 8oz patties with Cheddar (extra) Bacon (extra) lettuce, tomato, spicy ketchup, mayonnaise and to top it off...Chili (extra).  From what I have been told..you can keep adding patties to the burgers for $2.50 a patty.  The current record is 7, I think I can beat it..The burger was cooked perfectly and it had a very distinctive black pepper taste.  I personally love pepper so it was quite a delight, but if this isn't your thing, just ask to hold off.  The drinks by the way are bottomless, which is good when you have a 16oz burger you need to wash down.  Fatburger will be a licensed restaurant and it looks like they will be stocking some fine local Amsterdam Brewery products (on tap!!) .  All in all it was an excellent sojurn to the northern part of the GTA to experience a well known US chain that has been cooking Burger-y goodness since 1952..head on down to Fatburger in Thornhill"}

I wouldn't jump back in to Fat Burger to have my burger craving but this was on the way out..."}
{"text":"Thought my tip would suffice but seeing some bad reviews of the place I just need to put mine in. 

The first time I ever tried Fat Burger was maybe three years ago. I never had any reason not to go to In N Out for a good and fast diner burger. But one drunken night we were in some casino (Red Rock?) where there was conveniently located, a Fat Burger. I can't deny a good old fashioned burger drunk or sober so it was on. 

I'm not dumb or close minded so I wasn't gonna compare them to In N Out or any other burger. Not every burger wants to be an In N Out burger, some burgers just wanna be themselves damnit. I really like this fat guy! He's more than doable for me and I was an instant fan.  

Plain hamburger all day every day. I'm old school. I'd eat it between sandwich bread. The patty is hand formed and made to order and while the flavor is not out of this world it is close to out of the ballpark for me. Not bad at all. I've returned many times to this location. 

Speaking of which, you'd think it's my favorite Fat Burger since there's a full bar outside. Nope. It's actually my least favorite and specifically because of the bar. The service out there sucks big baseballs. Doesn't matter if it's winter or summer, they be freezing. I've never seen so many man bitches. Soo rude and grumpy and not taking any pride in the place like the other workers inside and at their other locations. That's what confuses me. The workers inside at the counter where you order your food are excellent just like the guys at the casino. The manager here was professional and even the cooks were upbeat. I felt extremely welcomed inside and then entirely snubbed outside. 

But unless I'm feeling sensitive, it's the food that I really care about. I'd eat a decent burger from a Yankee fan I would. This here will be my drunk burger. 

I've had the garden burger which I liked fine, but I love frozen garden burgers, so. I tried the turkey burger and it was also fine so I stick to beef since we're all so fine. I prefer In N Outs protein burger because I like the full lettuce wrap as opposed to a salad set up they have here. I'll add bacon and cheese to my burgers if it's one of those nights but if I'm really trying to party I'll add an onion ring to a plain or cheeseburger. Hell yes. The onion rings are what keep me comin. Home run baby. My fave onion ring I've found in burger land."}
{"text":"Fatburger and breakfast? I never really saw myself eating here on a lazy Sunday morning, but a quick and casual breakfast craving brought me here. Plus, seeing that breakfast is served all-day, I can see a breakfast fanatic (me) frequenting this place on more than one occasion.

Don't come here expecting extravagance. You get your typical breakfast sandwich: a bun packed with a sausage patty, cheese, and a fried egg on the bottom. The fried egg was a nice touch, which gave it more a homemade taste that you don't get in most major fast food joints. It's not a gigantic sandwich, but it's a good enough size to get my fill. Although it doesn't specify in the menu, the sandwich comes with a side of tater tots too.. score!

I'd skip out on ordering the OJ. Turns out, it's the bottled concentrated Tropicana stuff. Does not taste fresh squeezed, nor does it taste fresh. Reminds me of the sour OJ sipping sessions during depressing hospital visits. Definitely gonna roll with a coffee on the next visit.

Prices more than reasonable for the breakfast menu. I got my sandwich, tater tots, and OJ all for under $5. I end up spending almost twice that much getting something off the regular menu.

P.S. - Free Wi-Fi is offered here!"}
{"text":"Going to Mezza Notte Trattoria last Friday, I saw across the street, a burger joint \"Now Open\" for business.  I thought I would try it one day in the future.  Fast forward just 5 days, lo and behold... the future has arrived!  Hahaha!!!

I was around the Promenade Mall area today and decided, let's hit up that new burger joint.  I had no idea what to expect because I hadn't read any reviews or heard of this franchise yet.  From Discera Drive, I popped in and immediately, there was a seating area with all tables of peeps chowing down on burgers!  I walked into the place, old school pictures from 1950s America everywhere and... the corridor was kind of narrow before the ordering area.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you enter.  Surprise!  The staff, registers and menus overhead!  

Totally new to this place, all the staff greet, smile and asked if I needed to be served.  I asked the cashier, \"What's your recommendation on your most popular burger?\"  He let me know that it's the ORIGINAL FATBURGER which I have to try first before any other burger.  Good 'ole American burger.  Saw the picture to the side and fell in love!  Salivating, succulent meat.  For $6.99, that's the one I had to get.  I asked the cashier when they opened up and if there were any others in the country and he said, \"Last Friday and many in BC & Alberta\"!  It was the first one in Ontario.  So when I saw \"Now Open\" across the street last week, it was their opening day!  Wow!  Great timing and good location.

On my Original Fatburger, it came with all the toppings listed on the side menu.  Also, you can add 2 FREE toppings to the burger itself.  Excited to add, I got Jalapeño Peppers and Onion Rings to the burger.  Wonderful!

We took a number to our seat and the food was served to us in a couple o' minutes.  Burger looked scrumptous (look at my picture below).  I bit into it and the taste was preeeetty happening.  Condiments were absolutely fresh and crunchy.  The bun was plump and intact.  The beef patty was soft and delicious, although, not as juicy as I would have liked it but there was this nice, distinct taste about the entire burger.  I was happy with it.  By the time I had finished by burger, it became busy and there was a huge line-up.  I guess a lot of people in the Thornhill area needed a new burger fix.  I am most definitely coming back to order again and either get it with cheese and slam a poutine at the same time.  The pictures around the place does it justice.  Give it a try!  It's not a Goody's Burger, Priest Burger or Holy Chuck Burger but it's a close 2nd.  No harminit!"}
{"text":"I ordered at 11 and didn't receive my food until 11:30 and there wasn't really that many people there to warrant that long wait time.

Food was good as well as service sans the wait time.

Came here in February and didn't wait nearly as long with 4x as many people there"}
{"text":"My second time at a Fat Burger, the first one was in Vegas. This location was great! So much food for the price. They were very friendly and helpful staff. If you want a great HUGE burger. This is your place. They also have the best salad menu ever... check the pic to see what I mean haha :)"}
{"text":"Not at all what I remembered, the restaurant and service was great, but the food not so much.   There are other places worth visiting."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving one star is because I can't give zero stars. Service was slow. The bartenders are full of testosterone and like to use it to bully their customers. Never have I felt more disrespected as a customer/consumer. At this location the customer definitely does not come first."}
{"text":"Are you KIDDING me? $14 for a combo. Then I waited in the drive through line 15 minutes behind ONE person, gave up, left, never got my food. You losers need to give up and throw in the towel. You are incapable of running a drive through restaurant. You can't even afford to change the numbers on your menu, just taping paper numbers up there. Just give up and go out of business already."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to eating one of my favorite burgers. First time at this location and my favorite burger was 100% ruined. Ordered 5 burgers and boy were they spicy and salty! I couldn't even taste the meat! Even my kids refused to have their burgers! Horrible! The worst ever! Will never come back to this location again!"}
{"text":"I had purchased a Groupon awhile back and never had the chance to use it so it had expired. Recently I read the terms and conditions and it noted that I can speak to the vendor directly and that the money I paid for the Groupon never expires (suh-weeet). We head over to FatBurger and are told to speak to the bar staff. The man behind the counter quickly verified that the voucher was never redeemed and gave us two alcoholic slushies in souvenir cups, featuring up to 50 ounces of drink with 1.25 ounces of alcohol per 10 ounces of slushie ($30 value each) One large order of Fat Fries ($3.20 value). Fries came out quick, fresh, and crispy!"}
{"text":"I went to Vegas hell-bent on trying different burger places.  I got to the strip at about 2am and FatBurger was right there so I had to try it.  I had found memories of it from 8-years ago so I had to go and re-live it again.

First Impressions:

I have to say the Late night service kind blows. Took 15 mins to get my order. Food came out in about 5 though. I guess this is how I remembered it.  The cashier took a long time doodling with the register, guest who had already been helped were coming back and trying to add things on or make changes.  It was a cluster F.

It took me 20 mins to get 2-small burger meals with drinks.  That irritated me but I was hungry.

On Second Look:

In my humble opinion, a good burger isn't defined by its gimmick or cult following - but rather it's patty.  This burger's patty was delicious and it complimented the rest of the crap on there.  The mayo and juices were flowing and got me to forget about the sub-par service I got while waiting for it.  I think it's whack that you have to pay extra for cheese, but hey this is America.  

The burger is better than the service.  Go there if you're hungry and want to grub out, but don't plan a trip around it.  They also have an outside bar now which is kind of lame."}
{"text":"Ok... Nothing special. Burgers were way overlooked. Charged me for a shake, didn't bring it, charged me again, found my original receipt, asked for money back, was told it would be easier to just give me another one. Thankfully someone in our group wanted one!  Nice staff. Good chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"I love fat burgers but last time my families order was not right and ever time it gets dirtier and dirtier.  It is so unclean that I stopped going.  For example, go to a smash burger on Sahara and compare the inside and the cleanliness.  I like the taste of FB better but I don't want to eat some place that is dirty.  Imaging what the kitchen, that we don't see, is like."}
{"text":"Wow, terrible costumer service. Called to place an order for pick up. Young lady answers, tells me to hold on. So, I stay on the phone for 5 minutes while I hear chatter in the background that had nothing to do with being busy. Then I heard someone finally pick up the phone and hang it up without even checking to see if someone was on the line. So, I went across the street to 5 guys instead and will from now."}
{"text":"The staff there are so disrespectful and rude. I went in there to order but wasn't even acknowledged and when I finally tried to order, the staff said they werent making the meal in a very disrespectful way"}
{"text":"One of our party ordered a burger with no bun, only cheese, bacon, and a fried egg along with an order of sweet potato fries.

It was delivered smothered in sauces, tomatoes, peppers, lettuce.

They forgot the sweet potato fries, too. 

It took nearly 30 mins for them to redo the burger, so everyone else ate while our companion waited."}
{"text":"The food here is greasy and not worth it! The fries also weren't seasoned. 3 stars for the nice cashier."}
{"text":"$13 for a disgusting veggie patty, fries that were stale and beyond greasy, and an iced tea.  PUHLEASE.  So, so, sooooo bad."}
{"text":"Fat Burger. I had my first Fat Burger in Vegas on my burger run. I have to say the burger is a good burger. It's not in the class of a Bachi's or Gordon Ramsey's burger, but it is a good burger. I would certainly buy it again when I'm in Vegas. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Hey... soon as I get there... I ordered.... and got my food in 5-7 min... really fast... and great tasting.... thank you guys for amazing burger..my with delicious fat fries......"}
{"text":"This burger used to be sooo good. but has suffered over the years. So sad to see the quality go. Thank God The Habit is in town now."}
{"text":"4 stars

First experience - took a cab here from the club before getting dropped off....this experience was between 2-2 1/2 stars. service was ok, fat fries were good, but my medium fat burger w/ chz was really salty on one side. 
Next night I decided to give them another chance.....hiked all the way over here from Wynn at 4am.....I wanted to sober up, so that long walk did the trick. 
This time it was a little different....they had music playing, all the employees were having a great time and the service reflected that....
customers were coming in and dancing or singing along to the music (rap from early 2000 mostly)...and even choppin it up w/ each other while waiting for the food. 
I got a mini fatburger w/ cheese, fat fries, and skinny fries (for my gf). Said bye to my new friends.....grabbed a cab (I was almost sober, so no point in walking back) and headed back. 
Got back quick enough to still have warm food......shook my gf awake and ate.....mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmm!!!!!!
second night definitely made up for the first night."}
{"text":"If I could have given this place less than one star, I would have.  This place is a total disaster.   

Our sad tale begins by being greeted by our waitress, a woman that would make a skank look classy.  She took our order for a couple of beers and for our food.  She returned 10 minutes later with our beers, but that was the last that we saw her.  I guess that on some level, I should have been thankful. Any prolonged contact with our server would have ensured an incurable case of syphillis at the very least.   Did I mention that she was dirty??

After 45 minutes of waiting for the food, our beers long dry, we sought out our server to find out what was going on.  Upon finding her, the skank threw us a lot shade, and even had the nerve to state that it was my fault that we had been waiting so long.  Yup...skanks truly are dumb. 

At that point, I decided to minimize my contact with my server without having the benefit of a hazmat suit and found the manger.  Of course, he offered to get us our food right away, but we were pushing up on an hour at this point.  While this was all going on, my herpes scarred waitress was screaming that she had done nothing wrong....except be a waste of human life that is.  The manager saw what was going on and offered to comp us our entire check.  That being said, we thanked him, but told him tht he could keep his crap food because my guest and I just wanted to get the hell out of there.

This dump really needs to get a handle on its staff.  Avoid this one at all costs people.  

You've been warned!!"}
{"text":"Order started out with the person taking my order asking me how to spell my name. My name is H O L L Y. 
Burger was just ok...
Fries were worth one star 
Pricey. I spent 17.00 on a okay burger, good fries and okay onion rings with a med drink. 
Took them a long time to complete my simple burger order. 

I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service. Waited over 30 minutes for 2 burgers, fries and onion rings. Not worth it."}
{"text":"The burgers are decent they are way better in Inglewood though and they racist and rude as hell. I had to ask 5 different people to take a piss, white dude walk right in and he took right to it. Who has a bar with a locked washroom in Vegas of all places."}
{"text":"I love this place because I'm always drunk when I'm here, the chili cheese dogs are da bomb and gin n tonics are 2 for 1! Yeah Vegas!"}
{"text":"Shared triple burger with my wife and had perfect people watching over the strip!  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Great burger and fat fries! I shod of got that instead of the turkey burger. The turkey was good but when I tasted my hubby's burger, it made me want to get ine."}
{"text":"3.5/5

I'm by no means a burger expert, but I can tell if a burger is good in the sense of juiciness. This place wasn't bad, however I prefer In-N-Out over Fatburger if I were to live in the western US. If only the In-N-Out in Las Vegas was actually on The Strip proper...but I did plan to explore more next time I'm in Vegas.

I had two medium Fatburgers with onion rings for one of them. Believe it or not, the onion rings here are much better than the burgers. I love o-rings that are huge in size, and the fact the onions were also large in size (it's not just batter). This place has both aimed spot on! As for the burgers...I like the fact there are different sizes for the burgers, cause there's no way I'm eating a XL. I also like the fact the burgers are lean beef, so it's less unhealthy for you, although that might have contributed to why I find the burgers not as juicy as In-N-Out.

Again if I had to choose between Fatburger and In-N-Out, it's In-N-Out all the way. However Fatburger is also a great choice for those Vegas folks who don't wanna leave The Strip and want something that's not a buffet or splurge restaurant for a change."}
{"text":"Would have gave it a 3 star for a typical world burger chain restaurant, if it was not for the horrible service. We were walking down the main strip of Las Vegas Blvd. My friend Steve wanted to eat at Denny's, I said Hell no. Let go somewhere it's happening. Well we came up to Fat Burgers, right off the main drag. It was not to busy. I was not to hungry, but I ordered anyway. 

Here what I ordered, a large chocolate shake with whip cream on top, which it was really good. My sister ordered to Fry's, which it tasted like Burger King Fry's. It was not to bad. She also ordered the strawberry shake. She liked it. I drank the rest of it. My friend Steve ordered the chili, he said it was ok. 

Now to the service. We were #62, 63,64,65,66 and 67 were all waited on before we got our food. I sat and watch and stared at this guy making our shake. He took his sweet Ass time. I never in my life seen a human being take so long to make 2 simple shakes. Our waiter was horrid. I think litteredly  think he was stone. I had to ask him where is our food? He said\"ah i don't know\". We finally got our food 45 minutes later. Remember this is a popular burger joint, the burgers and food are prepped. They suppose to cook the burgers quickly. 

BAD BAD BAD SERVICE for a renowned burger joint, we should have gone to DENNY's, at least we would have got better service. Hope to God the CEO of FAT BURGERS reads this YELP!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Fatburger's and they were just ok but I love the Sunset Station location!! The staff is always nice but nothing special. The place is clean but nothing special. But what IS special is what counts, the food! Its fresh, greasy, delicious, perfect!  The burgers are good every time. And not just good but like one of the best burgers I've ever had! I recommend a Double Fatburger with an over medium Fried Egg (cooked whites, runny yolk) and Cheese. Yum! It's SO good!! It's rarely crowded so we order and get served quick! We go often and we'll go again! Recommend this location!!"}
{"text":"What burger eater doesn't enjoy a big messy Fatburger?!?

The burgers are cooked to order and offered in a bunch of different sizes with different topping options too.  Probably one of my favorite drunk food choices on the strip.  (kinda hard to get to tho, if I can remember right). 
This spot is open 24 hours and every time I've been, it's been filled with a bunch of drunk customers and funny burger flippers.

Throw a fried egg on my XXL burger with a side of Fat Fries and I wont need to eat for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"Fatburger is the latest in gourmet burger joints that have opened up. The store is at a plaza across from the Promenade mall in Vaughan, it looks like one of those new style urban-like plazas in a suburban environment, definitely unique, despite the setup, there's ample parking at the back so there is no problem.

The place has a 1950s or 60s kind of feel, it's old school, and the staff are friendly, there are a few big screen TVs hanging around too, and it wasn't too loud.

I just got the \"baby\" Fatburger which seemed bigger than a Quarter Pounder at McDonald's, the patty tasted fresh and had great texture, there's a good selection of toppings. There's a lot of stuff on the menu so you can be a bit overwhelmed.

The milkshakes taste amazing, price is a little steep, and it would be nicer if they had a smaller size for that."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the customer service here. I came through the drive through and had the woman taking me order LITERALLY yell at me. I found out that she was the manager! Such a shame that Fatburger would allow Marisol to be a manager when she doesn't even care about the customers.

Not even worth it. There's an In-N-Out right around the corner and if you really want Fatburger, go to the one inside the Santa Fe."}
{"text":"I love this place - the turkey burger, fries, and shakes are delicious. It's nicely decorated and homey with fun trivia and riddles on the numbered cards they give you to indicate your order. I've never been disappointed here."}
{"text":"Had the XXXL with cheese and bacon. It was amazing! Haley was a superb server! Came by and checked on us constantly."}
{"text":"To be honest I expected better. The burger was sloppy and the food was over-priced. I paid $22 for one combo and one with just a burger and drink. Not cool fatburger!"}
{"text":"First off, the food is always great. It's so good. But what made this experience wonderful is JAMIE. She was very nice and professional. Made our dinner well worth it"}
{"text":"Not that great of a burger spot, maybe it was because I'm sober and most drunk ppl would say it's all that but the burger is really dry and I honestly would have just went to In and Out instead"}
{"text":"Never in my life have I been to a Fatburger- in fact I've never heard of it. Strolled by and saw they have awesome cheap breakfast and even better... strong breakfast drinks! Our server was awesome (beautiful black gal) and the people watching is stellar! Drinks were $10 but strong and food was great. Had a $4 breakfast sandwich and we were set after a few screwdrivers. Patio had nice heaters as well. I dig it!"}
{"text":"Cheers to the Saturday late late night cook! The chili I like to order is mild for me so I asked him for the Tabasco since it was put away. He knew what I really wanted and went back to get me diced jalapenos! Best chili there ever! *smile*"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 med burgers with cheese, fat fries, onion rings and 4 drinks.  Priced was about $40 which was not bad for a burger joint that is made to ordered. 
we figured it would be a long wait but didn't realize it would be 20 plus minutes.  However after reading all the reviews we knew it was worth the wait.  Burger came out and it was dry, nothing like the other reviews where others said it was juicy.  Huge disappointment!

2 stars since the onion rings and fat fries we decent."}
{"text":"Fatburger. So good. After a long day of golf in 118 degree weather @ Angel Park, this place hit the spot.  Gotta get the fatburger with cheese, add bacon and egg. Man that egg makes the sandwich.  Pair it with a side of fries and wash all that grease down with a thick, ice cold milkshake."}
{"text":"Yes!  For all you hamburger connoisseurs out there. This Fat Burger was amazing and...wait for it...gluten-free buns. Yep! I was pleasantly surprised. I haven't had a bun, strike that, a good bun on a fat burger in years. Thank you! 
Oh, I was daydreaming about the burger. The service was great! The gentleman was nice, knowledgeable and courteous."}
{"text":"I've been to other Fatburger's in the valley and this one is by far the worst. 

Came in here at 5:50pm to order two burgers to go, one medium and one large, with cheese and no tomatoes, and some fries. The cashier was very nice, however don't be fooled, a nice face does not mean a sense of urgency. My order was punched in at 5:59, and since I know the burgers are make to order, I expected the food to be out in about ten minutes.

Wrong. The female cashier and the male cook had absolutely no teamwork whatsoever. They were all over the place and were literally falling apart, with only 4-5 orders on the screen. There was food just sitting under the heat lamp for a good ten minutes before she decided to grab it and hand it off. At the 20 minute mark, I was getting impatient, because an elderly woman got her order (two burgers) before me, and she ordered after me. I politely asked where my food was, and the cook said it was coming right up, and that if I had a complaint, it wasn't their fault because they were short handed. 

That's a load of BS in my opinion. I manage a high volume restaurant and any competent staff can handle multiple orders, ESPECIALLY when the whole menu is essentially burgers and fries. Even with two people, with proper teamwork, sense of urgency, and a sense of priority, they should be able to handle a work load, especially since it is what they are trained to do. 

6:34 comes around and I finally get my food, along with one other woman that was waiting for her orders to come out, which had a long ticket time as well. The cashier went up to me and said if I came in next time and said they botched my food, I would get a replacement. I don't want a replacement. I want to go into a food establishment, and get my order within a reasonable time period. 30 minutes is not acceptable ticket time for two burgers that weren't even made properly. 

Other locations are good, just this one needs some serious improvement."}
{"text":"One of the slowest \"fast food\" experiences I have seen.  The staff couldn't try any harder not to look more uninterested in serving the customers either.  The food however is pretty tasty for a burger joint, and the prices are what you would expect from a casino.  You can do better, but if a burger and fries are what you crave.  This is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Very poor in sanitization, employees are very rude to customers. Once saw a employee yell at a newer employee calling him some very rude names. Don't listen at all to what's going on the burger. I've gone 6 times to this location And only once have they even gotten close to making my order right... also once again sanitization is very poor needs to be greatly improved(found mold in my soda about 3 times)... only good things I've had I can say are amazing are the Fries and the milkshakes.. I prefer the one on the strip may not get my food on a timely manner but is way cleaner and more friendlier than here."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool because it is open 24/7 and has quality burgers better than your fast food joints like Carls Jr, McDonalds, Burger King...etc 

The price point isn't too bad. It sort of has a diner feel? My girls and I came here because we were starving, and this place didn't seem too bad. I had the Grilled Chicken Burger and it was pretty plain, but the meat had flavor to it. The fries were whatever. My gfs burger was yummy with melted cheese on it. 

They obviously don't have the best burgers, but they do have basic stuff to satisfy your hunger!"}
{"text":"Fatburger used to be good but those days are long gone!  I went to the sunset station one a few months ago and that experience was disappointing as well.  

When you pull up to the drive thru you get to look at the ghetto sign with paper taped over the old prices as you are waiting..and you will definitely wait here!  The food was expensive.. for two burgers, fries and drinks it came to over $30!  The food was okay and I got some crazy stomach pains and diarrhea later that night!  Save yourself some money and from food poisoning and stay far away from this nasty place!  

This was the last time we will visit a fatburger!"}
{"text":"Paid $36+ for two burgets, fries, onion rings, and two drinks and waited 25 minutes for our food.  We ended up getting our food to go because it took so long.  When we got to the car the onion rings were cold.  We will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Jack, was very awesome! 
He was funny and had quality customer service! He made me and my mother laugh as we were ordering! There should be more people like him working in any customer service industry! He had a very pleasant personality. He truly made our experience in Vegas amazing! He would be the reason we would eat at Fat Burger as we only came to order fries. He deserves a promotion!!!!"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours does not make this place good.  We stumbled in here as the sun was rising for a nice burger and a breakfast sandwich, and I have never been so disappointed by a place in my life.

The food took forever, with about only 3-4 people ahead of us.  Also while waiting we witnessed a fight between two guys waiting in line, rolling on the ground with light slapping back and forth.

Then I made the mistake of going to the bathroom.  I have never, ever seen a bathroom as bad as this one.  The Caution Wet Floor sign was up, implying that they mopped, but that bathroom has not seen a mop or cleaning materials in a long time and smelled horrible.

Our food eventually came out and was really mediocre, between all of us there, most said they wished we went to McDonalds instead and the rest said they wished they had not ordered anything at all.

I would never go back."}
{"text":"My first time here and all I can day is Bomb.com! 
Everything was great from the food to customer service.   The burgers were made to petfection and the burgers were delicious. I will definitely make this a stop every time I come to Vegas! The service was an absolute 10..."}
{"text":"I showed up here after work to get a burger and fries on Saturday night at 410am. The posted hours on the door read open until 5. The employees inside locked the door, then proceeded to laugh and ignore me. Unprofessional, and infuriating."}
{"text":"now this is the \"best\" hamburger around. huge, thick & juicy really flavorful. the relish & pickles just kill. the onion rings were super-fresh hot & crispy
this place is great-it doesn't matter where it's located in a food court or a stand-alone shop. they are always consistent. 

every thing is made to order. and the burgers always leave you wanting more. 

I lived across the street from in & out burger for 3 years-they are good but-fatburger is #1. 

always good service, fast & friendly staff, place is always clean & the decor is traditional burger stand. we love it!!!

Get yourself a baby fat meal with fat fries & a shake you won't regret it. Voted Best Fast-Food Burger!"}
{"text":"Great late night place for burger and beer. In the middle of the strip so easy to walk to.  If you are low carb like me you can order without a bun... Yummy :-)"}
{"text":"How can you not love this place. Open late, right on the strip, not too overpriced, great food, all the good stuff.
So its 3am and we've been walking the strip and most like several beers in. I'm in town for a convention and havent had a really good meal since i arrived. The co-worker i'm with says \"We gotta go to Fat Burger\". Being from the East Coast i had never heard of it, so I decided to give it a shot. Place looks nice enough, will have to go without beer for a half hour. I get in line, look at the menu, and decide the burger is where its at. I get up front and see a sign \"Free fries with purchase of beer\". What? They serve beer here too?  Hence the 4 up to 5 stars. So the burger was fantastic, and really hits the spot at that time in the evening/morning. The fat fries were just regular steak fries, but man those burgers hit the spot.
Looking forward to going back my next time out west."}
{"text":"I ordered a small Fatburger, while by boyfriend ordered a large Fatburger.  The burger was really greasy, which was a major turn off.  You could see the grease dripping off the paper.  Service was good and the vegetables were fresh.  I guess next time I'm eating at Fatburger, I'll order a grilled chicken sandwich, turkey burger, or veggie burger.  The grease ruined my appetite."}
{"text":"Ambience. B
Service. A
Food. A
Price. A

Open 24/7!

The Mgr recognized even after my 2nd time after two. Days. Nice friendly Service taking orders and patient in options and getting what you want!
 
They are constantly cleaning.  It's hard to clean up after a drunkenly Vegas strip and they strive to get it done.  Even to the bathrooms.  Stop making a mess people!

I ordered my burger with everything with extra pickles and lettuce.  Gives a nice sourly crunch with each bite.  The fat fries were nice and hot and fluffy inside. Mayo with my fries please!

Total. Under $11!  Glad they were open. As it was hard to find good food around this part at this early morning hour. 

I'm a fan early this morning a 4 am!  Burp!"}
{"text":"I love fatburger...i prefer it over in-n-out because the fries are spectacular and the burgers actually have meat in them. Now, I might be starting a war on this subject but if White Castle was in AZ, I would take that over both.  Fat burgers are good, juicy, and quick....and STEAK FRIES I LOVE STEAK FRIES.  Also, I agree with Stephanie L...if you don't like drunk college kids...then choose another location.  I like the bacchanus atmosphere myself."}
{"text":"The kingburger supreme is still one of the best burgers around, but they don't have the potato chip like fries anymore. They were fantastic, too bad because the normal fries are typical frozen crap.

I guess it will save me money getting burgers only"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, IMO ... The burger was over salted, but had nice crispy edges... The drinks were WEAK...I would've sworn that my first cocktail was all coke and no rum.

Service was spotty, but that's to be expected at an outdoor patio spot...

It was a great outdoor spot to perch up and people watch. The people factor in Vegas never disappoints! 

I'm an in N out girl...."}
{"text":"Don't bother with this place...  Worst experience ever.

The choice was McDonald's or Fat Burger,  My wife and I decided to try this place more so because McDonald's was crowded and we also wanted to sit down and enjoy a drink or two :)

We walked in bar area and were told by one of the guys cleaning the tables that we could sit at any of the table and order our food and drink there.  Well we waited and waited and we waited a bit more... The lady servers kept ignoring us and a few other people sitting at the other tables... We waited around  30 minutes or more

In the end our patience ran out and we walked out... As we left two young ladies were handing out coupons to people passing by to get them to go in.... Really why... You could not take care of customers who were actually there...  

The good news is we did not waste our money on this dive and found a place that served just what we wanted.. sadly no drinks... but awesome customer service... Check out my review on that place and give this dump a miss."}
{"text":"Every time I feel like and old fashion greasy burger, this location seems to fill that urge! The XXL with thick cut fries never seem to disappoint. Probably one of the best and more consistent burgers with so much flavor you can't go wrong except for the price ($18) for the combo. Groupon had one of the best groupons for this location, but they were probably losing money with it. Hands down best shake in the near area and always consistent with Haagen Daz ice cream!"}
{"text":"Wish the wait wasn't so long BUT it's so worth it. Can't be compared to any other burger because it's so different. 
BTW make sure you get yourself a side of \"Chipotle Tobasco Sauce\" and pour it all over the inside of your burger and you will never regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I get to review the bar service, food, and table service. Why, bar and table, read on...

Bar-2:30pm only 6 people spread out around a circular bar. Cut a pie in fourths and I took the last remaining section. The bartender waited/stood in one section and didn't move out of that area for 15min (not exaggerating) except to make drinks in service bar or talk to couple near service bar or check her phone (3x), never once looking at or acknowledging other customers. Granted it gave me PLENTY of time to study the menu and decide what I wanted, AND search my phone for other options. But, I wanted a burger.

Table- So, I switched to a table top, since they looked like they were getting waited on.  Again, not many people and service was slow but at least some one showed up to take an order. Service was-take order, run, drop, run, ask if u need anything as she's almost to next table, drop check. Sigh

Food- I sat across from a sign saying \"voted best burger in Las Vegas.\"
WOW, WoW, wow, the standard for burgers must be REALLY low for Las Vegas. My niece and I have made it our mission to search the DFW area for  the best burger, so I have some idea.
The pattie reminded me of a bulk stack of patties I once and last time bought from Walmart.
The rest of the burger, reminded me of Burger King. 
Note to self- got to Burger King, faster, better!"}
{"text":"Last Friday, my family and I went to the Texas to bowl and while there we decided to eat at the Fat Burgers. When our meals were ready, in which took them a long time to prepare, the buns were toasted to hard and overall the burgers, and the chicken sandwich was disgusting, even the strawberry shake was awful. Plus, it was too expensive to taste that lousy. That being the case, I will never, ever eat there again nor will I recommend it to my many circles of friends."}
{"text":"Ate there last weekend. Cashier was really nice! Great service. Just a warning though the burgers are huge lol. I didn't even finish half."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the original Fat burger with the fat fries and a coke. It was all delicious. The food was almost $30 for the 2 of us, which was pricey, but it seems like everything is Vegas is expensive. The service was fast and friendly. The food was good, but it's a little overrated."}
{"text":"This is convenient because it's on the strip and not buried in the depths of a hotel. There's ample indoor and outdoor seating. 

It's a typical Fatburger which means juicy burgers, and the fat fries (nice steak cut fries) are a must. This location is a bit pricey; now this just could be that I haven't been to a Fatburger since I moved away from LA, or their prices are just higher since it's on the strip. I'd go with the latter.

The wait is kinda ridiculous here. There was no one in front of me, and all I ordered was a cheeseburger and fries, and I waited like 30 minutes for my to-go order. Also, my burger came to me way before my fries, even though I was taking it to go, so I was pretty concerned my food was going to get cold. It's weird because loads of others got their fries before me, and I had to ask about my fries after my burger came, so I think they just kinda forgot part of my order.

Ultimately, this was an ok meal. I was in town because my boyfriend was at a convention, so I just wanted to grab something quick and take it back to the room since I was solo at the time. I just really wanted some fat fries though.

In Vegas, there's so many places that are better than this, and probably quicker (and maybe cheaper) that I'd prefer to spend my money elsewhere. 

This location is convenient enough to the Tropicana Hotel and MGM though if you need a snack."}
{"text":"Really? You are charging this much for a burger & drink?

Okay, they are open 24 hours...that is cool.  Okay, you do have a nice bar set up outside...this is cool also, even for a person that does not drink such as myself.  Yet, your prices are crack head crazy!

I must admit, the burger is not already made, already pressed meat filler substance that most chain restaurants serves you.  You had real beef on your metal tray, and you can taste the difference.  The strawberry banana shake, and the chocolate banana shake was both awesome.  Fresh ingredients in those most definitely, which you verified by not having all the banana completely shaken in your shake.  Yet, you charge for everything.  You want both buns, another 50 cents. Cheese is $1, straw for your shake is $1, use the restroom is $1, and looking in the direction of the bathroom is 50 cents.  

They made sure to have some of the decorum in a retro style diner set up, which was nice for nostalgia sake.

All in all, I think you should try this place at least once just to form your own opinions, but I know that my wallet will rarely make my way to this place, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING that there are buffets that cost about the same price as a cheeseburger combo with the works!"}
{"text":"Came for the impossible burger. Yet another place with no vegan bun and the lettuce here is shredded so a wrap won't happen. It was tasty but still annoyed that when you say vegan they don't know what that is. The wife got a real meat burger and it looked good."}
{"text":"Fatburger is one of my favorite fast food places to go to. Unfortunately, this time they failed. 

Over $50 in food for three people, we ended up taking home the following:
Overcooked burgers with little to no juice, which is something I appreciate Fatburger for... a good juicy burger. 
Horribly made milkshakes, Oreo was like drinking a cookie and the chocolate was so runny that it was like drinking chocolate milk. 
Vile onion rings and poorly made French fries. 

But it all started in the place when our food was ready way before our shakes, which the young man who was on the shake station forgot to make the two chocolate ones. So instead of being home in the 10-15 minute timeframe before the fries get too cold, etc.; we ended up going over that timeframe by about 20 minutes. 

Very disappointing and frustrating experience. Definitely will NOT be visiting this location ever again."}
{"text":"So after a little time spent in the pool, we went up to our room, showered and had to decide what we wanted to eat. I have Subway all the time and was in the mood for something else. My girlfriend, her cousin and I went with Fatburger. They both got burgers, I was feeling chicken so I got myself a spicy chicken sandwich and got some fat fries for a side.

After having my chicken sandwich, I was wishing I had the burger. It was your standard chicken sandwich. Not spicy, more peppery. The only heat it had was in it's temperature. The chicken was steamy inside the outside crispy layer. Took a little bit of time before I could eat it without burning my mouth.  It was a tasty chicken sandwich, but the burgers looked so much better.

I have had Fatburger in the past, but it's at least 8 years since my last one. Maybe I'll grab one on another night. I'll be staying in the Fiesta for the next week."}
{"text":"It was midnight when we arrived in Las Vegas and 3am technically for us since we came from NYC. My friend and I were starving right out from the airport as we were about to check in on our hotel we drove around to grab something quick to eat.

We ended up here in Fat Burgers and just randomly went in. I've got the fat burger medium meal as my friend tried out the turkey burger. You had a choice to add a topping for 1 dollar each however you want it. I chose cheese and a fried egg which was nice. I have to say the burgers were really juicy though not the healthiest late night meal, we were satisfied and once we got back to the hotel we were knocked out and slept well.

Great late night food!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks but ended up ordering burgers too. A fast food joint with alcohol?! COME ON! The chicken burger didn't even taste like fast food, it was sooo goooood! Almost gourmet.. maybe ? I enjoyed the fat fries also. 
We got two large drinks and a fat fry for $42 on Groupon-- well worth it. I'd highly recommend the strawberry margarita. 
The waitress recommended strawberry and Miami vice, I honestly didn't like this at all. I felt as though she was rushing to take our order and didn't seem genuinely interested in giving suggestions. 
Also, we asked for the bill but stayed for a few mins after it was brought to us. Right away the amount of the bill and 20% tip was placed into the bill holder.  About 20 mins after getting the bill, we gathered our stuff to leave. The waitress passed by and saw us near the exit and said \"did you ladies leave the bill?\" ... clearly we asked for it --- why wouldn't we leave it?  I might be overthinking but that was just weird since a group of females sitting at the bar got up.. left and weren't asked if they paid. Actually, our waitress never even asked if we were doing okay during our time there."}
{"text":"Walking around the strip late at night, and drinking made the hubby and I hungry. So, we stumbled into Fatburger.

They had a drink special; buy one drink, get the other drink free, so that was a special that we monopolized on. We were greeted fairly quickly after seating ourselves by a waitress that never seemed to hear me. I ordered a turkey burger (add an egg) and the hubby ordered a traditional beef burger and fries. 

There was literally nothing special about our food.  Did someone order \"extra ordinary for two\"? That is what we got.  The fries were pretty good, however, everything else was average! 

We will skip this burger spot next time."}
{"text":"Just sat in the drive thru from 12:38pm-1:06pm and our order was not complete, nor was it correct!! Very disappointing!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall good place to eat. I been to this location about 5 times now and it's good to decent. That restaurant itself isn't the cleanest. The bathroom is very old, the restaurant is kinda old now that I think about it. 

Fatburger gets very expensive well. Two people getting a 5 oz burger cost around 20-25 bucks! (Adding fries & a drink). Too much in my opinion. 

However, the food is good, and the shakes are very good. That is the main reason in why I like Fatburger. The customer service is good as well. This place is a three star overall I can't see it being more than that."}
{"text":"Waiting for a flight around midnight and never had Fatburger ever so we went in to try it out. We ordered 3 meals which totalled  $60... food was definitely overpriced for what we got. Everything was crappy and I know I'm never going back. Glad we tried it cause now we know."}
{"text":"We went here because my boyfriend thought it was so good and I had to try it.  Anytime I go to a new burger joint I always try the burgers exactly as offered in the menu.  So I ordered a fatburger with fries.  The server asked what kind of cheese I wanted and I said cheddar.  When she rang it up my jaw just dropped...$24 for two fast food meals?  When we sat down we figured out that cheese was an add on for 99 cents and they upsized the drinks and fries with out asking or even mentioning it.  
When we got our burger it was dry and over cooked. My boyfriend says they usually aren't like that though.  
A note to the owner:  I understand your employees were trained to do that and they did get an extra few bucks out of me this time but you won't get another dime from me.  Over cooked was forgivable but sneaky business practices are not."}
{"text":"Pros 
- Open super late
- Friendly cashier offered me a complimentary taste/small serving of the \"famous frozen custard\"
- Good, flavorful burgers (especially when you get them hot off the grill...see below) 

Cons
- Long, unnecessary wait was very frustrating!

I waited patiently for my burger to find out that it had been ready for 15+  minutes and the server had the wrong number for some reason. She was standing right next to me, and I even asked her if it was my order a few times. Lame! Would have been great if she offered to make a hot, fresh one. 

It was nice to try the custard, but I didn't think it was extraordinary...who considers it famous anyway?"}
{"text":"I haven't had a fatburger in ages so decided to order a freaking large fatburger with fat fries and a drink.  Omg them fries were awesome and the burger, Jesus Christ it was delicious, had a hard time devouring it all :D"}
{"text":"I Love Fatburger, but I was very disappointed with this location. My husband and I not only ordered the same burger and was overcharged in one of them, but they also got my order wrong. The manager didn't want to give us back the money extra nor did they offer to remake my burger how I ordered it. Bottom line, lack of customer service, especially for paying $35!! Never again."}
{"text":"Great casual burger joints with a little more class than a drive through. 
They customize your burger just the way you want in front of you and the huge fries are really yummy too. I don't eat a lot of fast food, but I would trust Fat Burger more than most places for a great burger! 
Also try a great milkshake!"}
{"text":"For the fact it's says 24 hours and closed at 1:16am on a Friday night. Drove over for nothing. Update your info please-"}
{"text":"Aye, if you're looking for a good burger with authentic topics and flavor right on the strip, this is your spot. Legitimate burger. A medium will fill you up just fine and it's pretty expensive to add to it aside from the basics. But totally worth it if you do! I got a medium with chili and cheese. Real chili and not some weird Texas Pete out the can type ish. This is good stuff. Stop by for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I remember years ago going to Fatburger and having a juicy fabulous burger that made you dream later of the wonderfulness you had just experienced!

NOT this time! Just not what I remember..... It wasn't the worst burger I have had.... but not memorable either.

I really wanted to give them 2 stars for the lacking of taste and quality... I tasted more relish than burger! 
I gave them 3 stars because of the fond memories of good burgers in the past!"}
{"text":"These burgers are A-OK, I like that you can get a small, medium, large, x-large, and super large sized burgers.  I ordered a medium and it was a little juicy (not bad for a fast food burger) but I would still say that 5 guys or Smashburger is a little better.  Still these guys don't make a bad burger at all and I would stop in again and recommend it if you are a burger connoisseur that needs to taste every burger.  I like that this location is close to my office and I was headed to Culver's before I came here but that place smelled so bad inside I had to walk out.  I also like the atmosphere here, it is a nice clean casual looking place and comfortable to enjoy a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The food is ok, good, nothing out of the extraordinary! If you've never been there I do recommend you go at lest once, it's one of those type of restaurants. I sat out side in the FATBAR, but I wasn't ordering alcoholic beverages so the lazy waitress said to go order inside cause the out door sitting area of the restaurant is a whole different owner or some non-sense like that."}
{"text":"Pros:
Well made burgers

Cons:
Size of sides lacking
Burgers can get really expensive

The family was feeling burgers so we decided to try out a new place.  We usually see this place when we're going to the T and T nearby.  As soon as you walk in, it looks like one of those diners from the 80s.  I liked the theme of the place.  It gave off a nice vibrant feel.

We ordered an angus burger and bacon cheeseburger combo as well as a kids meal.  You order at the front and the servers bring it to your seat when the food is ready.  It doesn't take too long when it'snot busy.  When we were finishing up it was a little busy and the wait times were about 10-15 minutes after ordering.

The burgers here are very well made.  It's a very good overall burger.  Everything is made to order so you know your burger is fresh as can be.  Burgers here range from about $8-$12.  If you add some extras like an egg, bacon, etc. your burger easily becomes a $15 dollar burger.  You still don't have any sides yet.  Getting a combo will set you back an extra $4.

Look, a $10 burger won't bother me if it's well made.  Fatburger makes a really good burger so that's fine.  It's the sides here that bother me.  The size you get here is pathetic.  I got an onion rings for my combo and my wife got the fries.  I think I had about 8 onion rings in total.  My wife had about 20 fries at best.  When you're charging $4 for a side and a drink, that's way too little to give.  You're going to be spending about $15-20 on a combo, you should be full after.

Fatburger makes a good burger, there's no doubt about that.  I just wished they would give you more value for on the sides.  If they change the portion size on those, this easily becomes a go to for me in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I think Fat burger is the best tasting burger we ever get. When we try new places we always compare the burger to fat burgers and fat burger always wins. A  place may have better fries but will not have have a better home cooked burger"}
{"text":"i like the burgers there dont get me wrong but they are so pricey,i dont go that often but my daughters like them so i went,i got to save my money to go to a fast food joint,pricey................................"}
{"text":"Really good burgers for a fast food place in a casino. Burgers are prepared fresh when you order them. Fries are either thick cut or skinny. Could have used some kind of seasoning, salt or something. But otherwise the burger really was good!"}
{"text":"It was a good burger. The food was plentiful as the name of the restaurant implies. Rihht now they are doing a limited time offer for a orange Creamsicle milkshake that was out of this world!! I honestly wish the serving was bigger. It was thick and creamy and delicious."}
{"text":"A typical burger place with the obligatory vegetarian burger option. This one is located in the Red Rocks Casino food court.

The veggie patty was a much thicker version of a Boca Burger (I actually had to pick at the burger before eating it because I thought for a moment they gave me a meat patty). 

The burger was tasty and very hearty, although there was too much relish on it which made the bun a little soggy on top. The fries that accompanied the burger were good - freshly made, hot and crisp."}
{"text":"One of my favorite guilty pleasure spots in Vegas. It's one of those places you truly love after you've had a few (dozen) drinks.

Honestly it's a typical burger place but the burger and fries are A+. In my opinion they are better than in-and- out burger and I know people would kill me for saying that.

The portions are huge. And unfortunately the service is slow. What do you expect though?

They offer skinny fries and fat fries. Always fat fries- always and I have to add cheese, bacon and egg to my burger. Oh yeah, and a Diet Coke because I'm watching what I'm eating. ;)

The best part about this place is that it's open 24/7 so you can get your fat on any time you want!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and the experience was alright. The employees were nice and prompt to take my order. I ordered it to go and was disappointed when I got back to work and noticed they had put everything on my Chicken Sandwich when I had asked for it plain. It wasn't a big deal scrapping off the lettuce but it's always annoying having to fix your food before you eat it. They had 50's music playing and the decorations were in the same vein although it didn't really have the overall 50's diner feel I think they were going for. All in all, I still enjoyed my food and will probably go back to this place in the future."}
{"text":"While looking for a place to eat in the middle of the night after had just arrived from the airport, we ended up here.  How bad can it be? Its a burger joint.  I opted for a small burger, perfect size for me and cooked the way I wanted.  Service was fast which we were happy about since we were so hungry.  Not bad for a quick meal, fast and affordable."}
{"text":"Love me some Fatburger, but disappointed this evening by the shops dirty appearance, along with the fact they were out of root beer, and when asked to substitute a turkey patty for a hamburger patty on a mushroom burger, it just proved too difficult for the counter staff to comprehend.

I enjoy coming to this location, but when you arrive and there is only one other customer in the shop you would expect for the shop to be spotless or at least the staff working towards that goal.

The restrooms are a completely separate conversation as they are filthy, and I wonder how they pass health inspections? Once you go in, you wonder how you are going to exit the space without catching something.  Urinal has been covered for weeks.  What does it take to clean a window or door??"}
{"text":"Took forever for the food. Very hot inside restaurant. Turkey burger was tasteless and disgusting, I didn't finish it. Kids burger wasn't much better,my child didn't eat it all either. Onion rings were gross also. Very pricey for the food we got. Not going back yuck."}
{"text":"What better way to satiate your drunken munchies in Vegas than to go to Fatburger.  I had the King burger with egg.  To tell you the truth I was too faded to even remember how it tasted.  2 important things:  1) I was able to eat it, 2) I didn't puke.  I'd say that's a good sign that It's at least worth three stars."}
{"text":"It was 2:30 in the afternoon, not a busy time at all. We pull up to the drive thru and they said they need a minute because of a shift change. We didn't know what we wanted so we said that was ok. After discussing what we wanted for 5 minutes, we told them we were ready. The lady then told us we needed to wait another 10 minutes because they were busy inside??? We pulled around and saw a total of 6 customers inside, which most of them already had food. Horrible service, horrible priced food which we didn't even get to try, and terrible workers. I'd advise everyone to stay away from this place"}
{"text":"Burger is pretty good. But they charged for ranch witch is on the free menu also charged $1 to cut my burger in half. Wtf a dollar to cut the burger and didn't even tell you it cost a dollar. $2 dollars for cheese and In the pics it has cheese on it. But will definitely say the burger is good. Customer service a little lousy though."}
{"text":"The famous Fatburger! We stopped here around 12:30 a.m. on our first night in town after a long day of flying into Vegas at 6 a.m. and then perusing the strip. We all got a Fatburger and fries, and they had some deal going where you got your fries free if you got a draft beer. Definitely a good deal with the high prices of Vegas. The burgers were good, but in my opinion just your basic quick burger. Not the best burger I've ever had, but I'm glad I checked it out. The outdoor/patio bar is great too on a nice summer night!"}
{"text":"Excellent service as usual from Duwan tonight!! Nice clean place.. the food and service is great!"}
{"text":"Fatburger in Red Rock is one of my consistent sanctuaries in Las Vegas. 
Usually I am here babysitting my grandmother during the weekly drawings on the weekends. The wonders an order of fat fries with cheddar and a chocolate shake can do for your soul is wonderous. ^_^"}
{"text":"Okay. What do you do when you're starved for a Fatburger when last time you were in Vegas, you were rushed off with no time to get one? Come back two weeks later and find the Fatburger closest to the Airport!

This one is usually crowded but I got lucky during 11pm arrival. What makes me give them an extra star above the normal three is that the cook suggested a new way to a favorite Fatburger staples: cheddar Fat Fries. Most awesome ever. How so? The cook melted cheddar at three different levels of my fries, not creating a cap, but actually soaking my fries in the greatness that which is cheddar. 

Plain medium fatburger with cheddar was perfect and my shake was great. Service was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Great when you're out and about at 3am and weaving in between the hookers that roam the streets late at night."}
{"text":"we just left fatburger downtown Vegas. Very bad service. Didn't even ask how we were doing or checked on how was our food or drink. I was almost choking on my burger cus I didn't have anything to drink.  Negative 5 stars"}
{"text":"after a few days of dining in the casinos (buffets, restaurants, etc etc), it was a big sigh of relief to order a burger and fries. what can you expect from a fast food burger joint? it does do \"made to order\" style burgers...and it did get a bit backed up. me and my cousin had 2 orders and it took over 10 minutes, which was fine. 

mixed crowd inside, and it was in a shady part of the stripe. lol. we did take out and walked back to our hotel while eating. pretty tasty!! i would say its better than In-and-Out burger down the road!"}
{"text":"I've not always received the friendliest service at this (or any really) location.  However I found Yaz here to be the nicest, most customer-focused person I've encountered in any \"fast food\" atmosphere.  Her beaming smile and genuine helpfulness was awesome."}
{"text":"The hands down, absolute best fast food burgers anywhere. I don't want to hear about In & Out either. They are good, but nothing is better than Fat Burger.

Fatburger offers you different size burgers. The XXL is way more than I should eat, but I eat it anyways. The toppings, the meat, and the fries are all much better than any other fast food place out there.

The staff is very friendly at this location and they are open late. Nothing compares to a Fatburger!!"}
{"text":"Veggie Burger in Vegas! For vegetarians on the Vegas strip, this is a good pick! Being an Ovo-Lacto veg head I had the veggie burger with cheese and a fried egg. Messy as hell and good as shit! (that's a compliment) My friends liked the regular burgers, the only \"meh\" to be heard was for the chicken strips. The staff was excellent. We had a group of about fifteen and the service was great. Outdoor seating with misting to keep it cool. Wish we had them in Atlanta!"}
{"text":"It's a tradition to sit out on the out door patio of Fatburger located right on the Las Vegas strip, dead center of all the craziness. At night they have bartenders who flare and  play good music like Kaskade (and similar artist) that makes you want to get your food and fuel for the next party. During the day it's just a nice shaded spot  which I can personally hang out at for hours until the sun goes down. The food is excellent but do not expect any healthy alternatives if you are watching your weight but who can stay on a diet while on vacation in Vegas, what is the point? The inside of Fatburger is for the families with childern to help shield them from the drunks and exposed bodies that walk the strip. I have only walked through to use the restroom :)...which is a disaster but you win some you lose some."}
{"text":"Good but a little overpriced, all the burgers are good, I've only tried the regular fryes not bad but they have lots of othere options."}
{"text":"Gave 1 star because the guy on staff that took our order was nice, polite and smiled a lot ..Cost $30 for 2 of the smallest cheeseburger meals. Floors were sticky all over the store. Tables not. Leaned. Bathroom was in terrible Gross shape. Soda machine was out of syrup. Napkin dispensers were empty... the 7 employees I saw were all hanging out in the back by the cook. Not once did any of them come out to the lobby to clean up or do anything that resembled work. Got our food and the buns were so old I literally checked for mold... all on a slow Sunday afternoon. No leadership. Can't imagine how dirty the kitchen is since the soda machine looks like it hasn't been cleaned in over a year.. just bad.. could have spent literally half the amount somewhere else and not had to worry if I was going to get e-coli poisoning.. #nevergoback"}
{"text":"I love the decor of the Fat Burger with its counter seating and old timey feel. The prob is that a meal is just about $10 for a burger, fries, and drink. That's outrageous for fast food in my opinion. 

They are currently running an interesting promotion where you buy a meal, and they give you a second burger for free. I guess if you have a hungry friend along who can cope with sharing your fries and drinking water, this would be a great cheap date place! ;-)

Best thing I ate here were the fries, Picked the skinny ones, as opposed to the steak fries. Very crispy outer shell and only slightly salty. A very clean natural flavor. 

The burger patty was tasteless as seems to be the M.O. for fast food joints these days with their overcooked meat. Nothing at all special about the burger.

Overall, I'd rate In N Out higher than the Fat Burger, since there is no equal to In N Out's Animal Style topping combo."}
{"text":"Always get the XXL with no bun for a delicious low carb meal. Pricey compared to most hamburger spots but in my opinion very tasty meal. Always made fresh to order. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very pricey but in my opinion a very good burger. I prefer it low carb style(no bun) & using a knife and fork. Friendly staff. Great people watching if sitting outside."}
{"text":"Compared to other FatBurgers I've been to, this one is lackluster.  Despite being a chain, the burgers here are not as tasty for some reason, maybe due to cooking technique?  The shakes are more watery than thick, and employees are generally disinterested and indifferent."}
{"text":"Oh baby! Fatburger was too good.

I visited this burger joint for the first time last night with a Yelp coupon. A $5 6oz AAA angus beef burger with Canadian cheddar cheese and free customized toppings. I dressed mine with grilled onions, an onion ring, pickles, lettuce, tomato and mayo. It paired nicely with a $4 pint of Amsterdam. The burger melted in my mouth! It was fresh and bundled up tightly in it's blanket/wrapper.

The staff were super pleasant too. The guy on cash was efficient and finished my sentences. 

me: \"what toppings can i...\"
him: \"right here on this list\"

me: \"what's the secr..\"
him: \"it's like a spicy ketchup\"

He and another lady came by twice to check on us.

Great customer service, amazing taste and quality. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We love Fat Burger.  The food is miles better than In-N-Out, and usually this is a really fun chain to eat at, but we have completely given up on this location for one reason and one reason only...

The employees need customer service training.

One occasion, we showed up 15 minutes before the sign said they closed, and they rushed to the door & told us they were closed.

Next trip, we walked in and the girl behind the counter who takes orders was sitting on the counter (no customers in store at the time), chatting with the cook and took her sweet ass time getting over to the cash wrap to take our order despite looking right at us when we walked in...and when she finally saunter over, she said not a WORD.  Just stood there glaring at us, waiting for us to say something.

Normally this location (unless really busy) brings your food to your table when its ready.  On the last several trips, despite being the only folks in the place, the cook waves his spatula at you & says \"ready!\" while same lazy cashier girl sits on her ass.

It's no wonder this location never has any customers any more.  We take the extra time & effort to go to the Desert Ridge location instead now.

I wonder why the management of this location hasn't wised up yet.  Clearly his/her business is suffering & its all due to the shitty attitude of the employees!"}
{"text":"Amazing how they transform a burger!!!  Pretty sure the best I've ever had!!!!  Definitely going to recommend it to others!!!!"}
{"text":"First place I've ever been where an employee needs to unlock the door for you to the restroom!!! It was very strange. I just assumed that you would go up to the counter, get the key and do your thing. But nope, the guy walked back w/ me, unlocked the door and off he went. The thing that was also weird was that it was a multi person bathroom.

We walked in, we had never been here before, and it was a straight shot to the cash register. The way this place is set up is awkward and if there would have only been 3-4 people ahead it would have put almost back to the door. I could see how during busy times it would suck cause you would be stuck outside while standing in line.

We got up to the register and looked for a menu, there was none. All they had was a little laminated sheet that told you what the burger toppings were. They have a digital menu, but it is not helpful. In my opinion the screen moves waaaaaay too fast, you see something that looks good but then the screen changes. It a pain cause while you are trying to figure out what you want, you also dont want to hold up the line either.

We finally decided on our order and purchased 3 cheeseburgers, and order of fries, 1 soda and 1 strawberry shake and it cost around $45!!!

The burgers were VERY good though. The buns were butter grilled, the burger was very juicy and had a good flavor. I especially loved the crispy char on the ring of the burger. The fries were cooked to perfection. They give you the option of steak cut fries or thin...we opted for the thin ones. My strawberry shake was creamy and had chunks of strawberry in it. I am not sure what I was expecting in regards to the shakes. A lot of places I have ordered strawberry shakes from have just used the flavoring, so I was thinking it was going to be something along the lines of that. I am glad that I was wrong...these shakes were REAL ice cream and REAL strawberries. The shake took a little while to make, but it was totally worth it.

I would consider coming back here. The service was great as was the food. The price was just a little much for no more than what we ordered. If this was a sit down type of place and included a side and/or drink it would have been different. They were also running a Groupon deal, but it wasnt valid for this location."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this location, I do think it's great they have Boca Burgers though.  I generally thing FatBurgers are great, and employees are nice but this one the employees are always so unpleasant.  And the food is simply not as good as the other locations.  This one is simply a disappointment."}
{"text":"Very lousy hamburgers and service was awful. I had heard this place was good for years but was disappointed. I had a movie ticket and they refused to give me my 10% discount. Employees speak little or no English and have poor customer service skills."}
{"text":"every time i come here when I'm in Vegas it is awesome. the one in SA sucked and closed, so I'm not sure what makes these so different but the only thing that's sad here is the price. the burgers are pricey and not all that big. but they are certainly Delicious. (get the fat fries, they are wayy better than the reg fries)"}
{"text":"Updating my review,

The only time I feel a restaurant deserves a 1 star review is of I got sick eating their food...

I got sick and got runs that night.. Not to mention in my review after the meal, I mentioned the meat with very pink..

Went there breakfast/ lunch, first meal of the day, went to play badminton after work and started getting the runs.. Couldn't sleep all night..

~~~~~~~~


In my opinion, a little less then 3 stars. Was going for a burger lunch and it would have been Fat Burger or Bone Yard which is right beside, but they weren't open.. Even tho it was supposed to be open.

Place was run by 2 Asian kids..

6oz original fat burger is $6.99

My XL Burger (Double Fat Cheese) was 12oz $11.99.

Burger was cooked from fresh, it was somewhat hand pressed.. They advertise Angus Beef, but the patty seemed not enough for some reason...

The fat juices were just dripping right out when she plated it on the bun.. She had to hold the burger up sideways just to let the juices go.. It looked sooooo delicious!!! I'm a huge fan of fat unhealthy juicy beef burgers..

The bun was lightly toasted.. Not enough, 3 stars on the bun..

The patty didn't seem 100% cooked.. Maybe 75, 80%.. It was very pink, but no blood dripping..

For my reviews, 3 stars means I would go back but wouldn't recommend, 4 being I would recommend it to others to try..

Reason for being a little less then 3 stars, Bone Yard is right beside, you really have to step up your burger game if you have competition right next door.  I've been to BoneYard before and remember it being a slightly better experience.. It was probably a year ago but I will go back again in the next couple days to see what they have for a burger..

Good thing about this place, they lots of different exotic burgers you can try. So they take the original 6oz fat burger and make a Texas burger which ranch sauce or Mexican burger with gauch and the list goes on forever.."}
{"text":"I had a turkey burger which I could have liked but it was too salty.  I was surprised that the burger was actually seasoned.  I will try it again! We came early in the day and there wasn't a line, I heard this place usually has a ridiculous line.  Did I say I will try it again!  Hopefully next time the burger won't be salty and give me high blood pressure.

The staff was very pleasant!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap place to eat that's not the typical fast food joint you'd find across the nation, eat here!!! The burgers are actually quite tasty. I ordered (my very first) fatburger, with cheese and egg. The burger was well flavored and juicy, a good amount of pickles and mustard to finish off the hamburger. I think I only tasted one bite of onion though. If it weren't for In-N-Out, I'd say this place definitely outranks any franchised burger joint. But, a true fan stays loyal. In-N-Out forever. However, Ice Cube, I do know what you mean. I too, would want a fatburger 2 in the morning...only in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fries were hot and fresh cooked.  The burger was warm and dry not cooked fresh. It had a pile of pickles on it when I ordered it without.  This was my second time eating here but I won't come again unless it's for the fries."}
{"text":"I had it two times and the first time it was good.  This time the fries were great but the burger was cold and dry. Told them no pickles came with them piled on it.  I didn't see them cook it on the grill fresh it was slapped together and passed out the drive through in less then three minutes.  Last time it took about ten min but was hot and fresh.  This makes me realize how important Hot and Fresh all the time is. Never coming back after this bad burger:("}
{"text":"I guess I should not be surprised. It looks like the easiest things to make are nowadays the easiest things to ruin. I mean, how difficult is it to make a decent hamburger? Why cannot they get it right? They certainly don't want to get it right at Fatburger. It is probably because they are trying to hoodwink you.
After paying $10 for a cheeseburger I was left with the feeling that some people have no guts and must give everything no matter how bad or average a five star rating. The burger patty was dry and shriveled. I guess they use low quality meat and perhaps salt it too much and let it stay. Not only that it is was small. Imagine a drier McDonalds patty. So, the race for the most expensive and disappointing hamburger in town continues.
Fatburger sure know how to make up for the size of their patty though. Almost half the head of a lettuce sits on the burger. Let's call it Lettuce Burger with a dry and sad patty underneath.
If you go add extra ketchup/mayonnaise/whatever to insert some life into your burger.
At my end I have boycotted Burger's Priest for the owner's disgusting beliefs, cannot afford to pay $25 for a burger at Drake and of course usually have more sense than to enter a Burger King. I will continue to make my own, visit Harvey's if I am in the mood when walking around the city or keep searching for a decent hamburger I don't have to empty my bag's content for.
It just dawned on me. Their burger is similar to Wendy's. I want to be careful writing it because I have not been to Wendy's in a long time, but from what I remember Fatburger may be getting its burgers from the same source as Wendy's.."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow, but since I love their burgers it's decided it would be worth the extra wait. I had ordered a large burger and after waiting for over 30 minutes at the drive through window, I lost my patience and left. In a fast food world this is definitely not acceptable. The whole idea of a fast food joint is to get your food in under 10 min. Not going to be visiting this place. I am sure they need to look at new management."}
{"text":"YOOOOO. Ordered a burger meal with a drink from Uber eats. Took these mofos 54 minutes to FINALLY send the guy on his way. He arrives without a drink and both the fires and burger are cold af , the bun was stale and I'll be surprised if I don't sh*t myself tomorrow. ::Finger crossed::Never again"}
{"text":"Most of you out there, don't know that I am married now & that my wife is 100% Finnish. I don't know if this is strange, but my wife's favorite American food is Burgers. Having said that, we have been going out of our way, to try every Burger joint on the west-side. I have to say after trying: Farmer Boys(very good), Smash Burger(over rated), 5 Guys Burgers(worst burger, but insanely good Fries), Montana Meat Packing Co.(very good), In-N-Out(best service & wife's favorite), Red Robin(great, but pricey), Chilli's(so-so for the price), as well as the Real National Fast Foods: Burger King(best of the Nationals), Wendy's(love the Red Head in the commercials, burgers lack flavor), Carl's Jr(not bad, but also not great), McDonald's(a familiar friend, but never the first choice), Jack In The Box(hate the burgers, love everything else), & Sonic(way over-priced). We have not tried: Any Asian Burger joint, Gordon Ramsey's Burgr, Applebee's, Heart Attack Grill & White Castle.

After everything is said & done, Fatburger is still my favorite all-around Burger joint. Keep this in mind, I love a thick, juicy burger cooked Medium Rare to Medium, any more than that & I consider the burger to be burnt. I also love Fat/Steak fries or Potato Wedges. Fatburger has everything I look for in a Burger Joint.

The bad things people say about Fatburger: They take forever to make your food- yeah, this is true, but everything is made to order & I get the Fattest Burger, with Fat Fries & this gives me the perfect time to have a pre-meal smoke. Service is bad- Not True. I have been to almost all of the West-Side Fatburgers & have always had better service than a McDonald's or Burger King. Fatburger is pricey- yeah, this one is true, but if you eat as much as I do, I normally spend just as much at McDonald's or Burger King...... I just need 1 FatBurger, instead of ordering 4 normal fast food sandwiches/burgers.

The Skinny on Fatburger: If you love your burger, thick & juicy burgers & the option of  steak fries, Fatburger is the best California Chain Burger Joint."}
{"text":"Best Burger in town!
They are a must while staying on the strip in Las Vegas. Everything is made to order. You can add what ever toppings you want. They have a small sitting area outside and in. You can enjoy a burger and people watch! What better to do in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Always satisfied coming here, whenever the girlfriend and I have a craving for a juicy burger, this is our go to place.  The fries are excellent, and the burgers....ohh the burgers are amazing, we have not had a bad experience.  Definitly Recommend,"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service!  Food was amazing!!!!!!! Definitely the place to be for indoor or outdoor casual atmosphere. Staff was friendly and happy to see you!"}
{"text":"My first time getting a fat burger, and I wasn't impressed at all. Fries were stale and room temperature and the cheese burger was nothing special and they put way too much mayo and lettuce on top which made the bun soggy and gross. I don't eat fast food that often but I'd rather have had mCdonalds than this place."}
{"text":"A good burger, but still not enough to defeat the venerable In-N-Out in value and taste.

I use to eat at Fatburgers ages ago because it was by my college campus, so convenience factor was there. But got converted once I discovered In-N-Out despite having to drive out to get it. Never looked back since. 

Funny thing happened, I was going to try LBS Burger so I asked the Fatburger employee where its at. Yup, I really did ask Fatburgers where I can find their competitor burger place is at. They didn't know.

Was at Red Rock waiting for the movie to start so just grabbed a bite here. For around $11 I got a really big burger and fries. I got a pretty good value based on the size of the burger and the fries, but flavor just didn't impress me. Much better than Fuddruckers. Fries were very good though with the clean and crispy flavor. 

Good place to get burger if you're in Red Rock. You probably won't be disappointed, but if you have the option to go with In-N-Out, do yourself a favor and go there instead."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place. We saw an episode of Undercover Boss and thought after that episode that this place would be top drawer as a result. Sadly, not the case. We had two cheeseburgers and a side of fries and one soft drink. It was almost $25. The burgers were decent, but not spectacular. The real downfall was the building and overall general appearance. The ceiling was disgusting with dirt, grime and severe water stains. There was grease and grime all over the salt and pepper shakers, and the whole place was generally grimy. The place was pretty slow, and even taking into consideration that everything is cooked to order, it took 15 minutes to get our order. To top it all off, a message to corporate was totally ignored. Guess the show was simple \"entertainment\"."}
{"text":"Ever thought about having a heart attack at a young age? Well this place can help you out with that! Kind of a cutty little burger joint along the strip. 

A cheap place to eat, but definitely unhealthy for ya. I ordered a large burger combo with egg and the sandwich gave me mixed feelings. The burger was good, but it was a bit too oily for me. The oild drenched the wrapping paper and onto the table and slowly made it to the edge of the table to drip on my pant. The egg was not my expectation. It could be my fault, I was expecting sunny side-up, but it was not. I guess I wanted the egg yolk to drip all over the place but that didn't happen.

If there was a Fatburger where I live, I would definitely give it another try. Probably the next time I go to Vegas, I'll stop by for a visit."}
{"text":"Ordered through Postmates. Delivered on time. 2 out of 3 orders came out wrong. One of them just completely messed up. There was no special instructions. Nothing fancy just some simple burgers."}
{"text":"Fat Burger has been my favorite hamburger place since I first was introduced to it in high school.  My school was only a few minutes away, and when we could, my friends and I would sneak over to Fat Burger for a delicious escape.  Now that I'm at ASU, it's closer than ever!  Better than In n' Out, better than Sonic, Fat Burger is your ticket to hamburger heaven."}
{"text":"Good burger yet a bit over priced. Then again its Vegas and most is. Burger was very tasty, fries were good and Strawberry shake was good too. Overall, just what it needed to be."}
{"text":"Decent burger but way overpriced.  $12 for regular burger and fries.  In N Out $6 for double double and fries and in n out is better quality.  Had Fatburger in Barstow and it was pretty good.  This one wasn't up to par.  If you're gonna charge it, you have back it up and they didnt.  Won't return here."}
{"text":"Nice stiff specialty drink ( pop the cherry ), and a good burger. I still think In and Out is better. Cool scene at the burger bar outside, but hey this is Vegas, cool scenes are a dime a dozen if you don't come here often."}
{"text":"Amazing workers. My wife and I sat in and were treated with courtesy and smiles. The three guys there were huslting and getting those orders out as quick as they could. Good burgers as always but the owner seriously needs to help these guys out with one more person. Thank you, we wiil be back for more."}
{"text":"The employees are nice and the food is great. How do you not love Fatburger? 

This location is nice because it is in Red Rock and there is plenty of seating and always clean."}
{"text":"Juicy, made to order, and tasty burgers. It might take a while for your order to be ready, but that's because they make it as you order. You can taste the difference in freshness though. I really like the classic Fatburger with cheese without onions though. The chili cheese fries are worth trying too. You have the option of \"fat\" fries or \"skinny\" fries. The \"fat\" fries are steak cut fries, so much thicker and wider. The \"skinny\" fries are like thin cut, shoestring style goes. I like the chili cheese fries with the skinny fries. The sauce gets to get in the nook and crannies. They have a grilled chicken sandwich option as well, but I think I'll stick to the burgers since I think they are better at beef than chicken. Also, if you save your movie ticket stub for that day, you get 10% off. Not bad, but make sure you give them the movie stub as they ring you up. So, if you haven't tried Fatburger before, I say go for it!"}
{"text":"The burgers are good. The chili cheese fries are even better. Getting your food takes a while since everything is made to order. The staff is friendly and I think they do their best to try to get your order out as soon as possible. I usually get a Fatburger with mayo, onions, and cheese. The meat is well seasoned and juicy. If you do get the chili cheese fries, you have the option with going for fat fries ( thicker cut fries ) or skinny fries ( thinner cut fries ). I personally like it with the skinny fries because more chilli cheese goodness gets in between the nook and crannies. Not giving it four stars because sometimes the food takes a long time to be ready, so it doesn't make it a good quick lunch/dinner spot if you are short on time. Still recommend for the food though."}
{"text":"Fat burger has gone Hollywood! I never thought that I would see the day that the restaurant would look better than the burger. $7 for a 1/3lb burger that looks more like a slider. I'm good of the Vegas Fatburger. I hope the one on Crenshaw didn't change up on the original Fatburger patrons!"}
{"text":"I stopped eating red meat for a while.  Decided to get a burger because I was starving and it sounded good at the time (cause I was drunk!).  Lo and behold, Fatburger carry's Trukey Burgers!  YEAH!  Had 3 over a three day period.  Loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided to give this place a try after enjoying a night on the strip. 

Lots of pros here: 
1. Open 24 hours, which is perfect after a night of walking the strip and partying. 

2. Lots of menu options. Whether you like turkey burgers, veggie burgers, a paleo burger, or shake, this is your stop. 

3. Friendly staff. The service is great. 

4. The food is really good. Especially the onion rings and the shake. 

Cons:

1. restroom is kind of nasty. 

2. Because the food is so good...the line is long. 

3. Even though I enjoyed my food, I felt it was a bit overpriced. I paid $18.00 for my burger, onion rings, and shake."}
{"text":"I stop in about 1/month. The last 2 times I've been here, I'm starting to doubt how this place is run. The cooks are the only people doing work with good service. Each cashier I've encountered does not greet you or tell you thank you for coming in. They drag their feet over to the register and start putting in orders. No \"Hi, what can I get for you\" or any acknowledgement.  I feel like I'm standing there waiting for a sloth to come take an order. A big downfall- they don't serve their lemonade here. I would have only given 1 star, but the food is still good and the cook does a good job. Maybe they should replace the sloppy cashiers to better business here."}
{"text":"This burger joint operates in the Green Valley Ranch Casino and is a Fatburger franchise.  Now Fatburger is renowned in California for their juicy delicious burgers.  However their reputation does NOT translate to the Green Valley Ranch Casino location.  I went there about a month ago and asked for a medium large fatburger, hold the relish and mayo.  The mayo and relish were held however the burger came as a salty grossly overcooked piece of meat, more tasteless than the inexpensive major burger chains and cost $11.45.  I was shocked.  I recently returned and placed the same order for a large fatburger medium rare.  The waitress said fine.  Again to my surprise I received an overcooked burger loaded with salt. A piece of shoe leather would have been more appetizing!!  Again I paid $11.45.  Two times is enough for me.  This place is the WORST and does not come close to living up to the Fatburger standards. This franchise needs to be closed. You would do better and cheaper eating at any other burger joint in Las Vegas and there are many."}
{"text":"Love the service here !! This is my first time my boyfriend said he loves it so I'm like omg whatever ! Let's just try it and you get to pick what you want on your burger and that's what I like . Lol . I already know the burger tastes good just by looking at it ."}
{"text":"OK, I like this place for my selection (as follows):

XL, cheese, grilled onions, egg, and hot sauce (tabasco)

These are salty and fatty...thats why they taste so good to me."}
{"text":"I recently learned about the \"Impossible Burger. It's a plant based burger for non-meat eaters like me. I am always looking for new vegan / vegetarian things to try so I made my way over to Fatburger. 

I browsed the menu but I didn't see the burger listed, so I asked if they had it, which they did. 

We ordered two impossible burgers, one order of onion rings, one order of fat fries, and one drink. The total was $45.00. I thought I heard the cashier wrong, it was rather noisy, dinner for two at Fatburger can't be that much? I gave him my card and got my receipt. Confirmed, the total was 45.00! 

The impossible burger was 15.00 each!!

The food came out soon after ordering. Moment of truth, to try this hyped up, $15.00, Impossible Burger. The Impossible Burger was amazing. Being completely honest, this was the closest thing to real meat that I have tried. The texture and flavor was just like a burger. Topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles, mustard, relish and everything else, it passed as the real thing. 

I was super excited that the Impossible Burger was amazing. I have tried so many vegan or vegetarian dishes at different restaurants and have been disappointed at times. Just because it's vegan or vegetarian doesn't mean that it should lack flavor or that wow factor. 

This review is 4 stars because the price. 15.00 is a bit pricey in my opinion."}
{"text":"Inside the Santa Fe casino. They're friendly and a lot faster than a stand alone franchise. I personally like it better than the other one not too far from here because it feels safer ."}
{"text":"RUDE. Dirty. It takes 30+ mins to get a burger. The people behind the counter fight with each other.. Like the whole time I was there..Raise voices & curse. The people before us got a refund..because of grossness and attitudes they were receiving. 
The big white chic who makes food and takes orders is the most unpleasant person to order food from. Aside from her attitude her body rubs up against the food as its being made.. Puts a glove on one hand.... Yet touches the burgers with the other. I'm starving.. I wish that would have been a good experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here  for lunch with a friend on our way to the pool. They have the best little burgers & fries!! I say little cuz i get the small one..its just enough for this girl!
The fries were really good and salted to perfection.
I love me some Fatburger!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Hard potatoes and a English muffin that was micro waved  thI waited over 12 min for"}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent. They greeting every customer that came and left the location. Very friendly staff the food was not good. The fries were fresh, but the burgers were dry. I don't know if it was because it was Turkey burger, but I was very dissatisfied. I only tried  this place because it was next to my mechanic. Maybe next time I will try something  different just because of the great customer service."}
{"text":"Although the burger wasn't the best, it was good. I got a medium size and that itself was pretty filling. I was able to stuff it with lots of extras including bacon, grilled jalapeños, and grilled onions. Inside was nice and clean and worked rather quickly. I went at a busy time, so I waited the most 10 minutes. 
I also had an Oreo shake. Now that was good :)"}
{"text":"My kids love Fatburgers!  After sitting in crappy traffic on the Strip, enjoying a sightsee of all the pretty lights, I was able to do a U-turn and hit this place.  The parking was a breeze even if you do have to shoo people out of the way from crossing the driveway, which is nonstop.  Sorry, move the F out of the way, I'm coming in because I'm hungry enough to jump out and start chewing on one of you people.

We got in and there was no crowd.  I have to warn you here, FB is pricey, but we knew that already.  I just ordered for the one daughter, but my other one decided she wanted McDonald's; me too.  Woo-hoo, McDeath's is just next door!!!!  Sweet!

So got one kid situated outside at the open air seating, complete with open bar and misters.  Please, if you're a slow eater, sit away from the misters because they spray every other second and it does get annoying after a bit.  We went to the McD's next door and luckily avoided a big gang of folks who herded in.  

It was very nice sitting there people-watching out on the strip.  A nice calm evening with my teenagers, watching guys hand out X-rated flyers to passers-by.  

Leaving is the same hassle as coming in because I had to darn near run over folks to leave because they don't care if you've been sitting there a while waiting to LEAVE!  Fortunately, I'm from back East and have a A-card on guerrilla driving.  MOVE!  So just be prepared to be a little proactive in that department."}
{"text":"oh Fatburger, how i missed thee.  how long has it been since i last pay you a visit?  ahh that's right, it was back when i was dating this chick who gives me a guilt trip for not being religious.  i guess that's why she is history and Fatburger isn't.

succulent burgers, golden brown fries, cavity-forming root beer float..., need i say more?  i could hardly contain myself when i was in line and almost plowed into the people in front of me.  ya so i was hungry, forgive me (i'm being religious here).  i broke down and ordered me a chili-cheese fries, a cheese burger, and washed it down with a big-ass root beer float (sinful).  i can't say that  i'll stay afloat after having all that food (i'm going down straight to hell)..., but i sure felt an orgasmic (heavenly) experience.

so next time you spot a Fatburger, go in and have yourself a religious experience.  i'm sure my ex would have been proud of me!"}
{"text":"I've tried Fatburger several times, on Denman in Vancouver and at the first location in Calgary at Deerfoot Meadows. I've always been happy with what I've had there but not consistently at Bankers Hall. One time I got a burger with bacon I'd absolutely not requested on it. Another time I tried the turkey burger which has bizarre sage seasoning and just comes across as turkey sausage in burger form on an unfortunate whole wheat bun (which NEVER belongs anywhere near a burger). Then I fell in love with their baguette sandwiches but they took them off the menu.

Why, given this spotty history, am I giving this location five stars?

Because I saw burger heaven today. I finally ordered the King. Two 4-oz patties, delightfully messy, perfectly cooked beef  on the softest, most UNCTUOUS bun. The whole experience was transcendent. I had the best burger of my life at P&L in Toronto in May and this is the single best burger I've had since then. I'm instantaneously obsessed now- plotting ways to get downtown even though I work at U of C. I just can't say enough. It was amazing.

Fries were superb as always- Fatburger has the best fast-food fries in town."}
{"text":"Rude staff, slow service, poor quality food and MUCH MUCH MUCH too expensive. This place is a huge difference from the one in Bellevue WA that my boyfriend and I used to eat regularly at. 

The food here is much more dry and tasteless than the WA stores. The prices are almost twice as much, even for the off strip locations, and when asked about them at this location, I was directed to go to the one in Summerlin which is cheaper... After an almost 30 minute drive, we get there to find... exactly the same prices. Good thing we've got a fuel efficient car.

Locations that are not right on the strip have no right gouging locals for the same prices that tourists get slapped with on the strip. Would not return..."}
{"text":"This place is expensive as hell! But it is Vegas and on the strip so technically this should be considered as \"average\" price. Came here at 1:30am Sunday morning and ate outside on the patio area. Music was playing, nice cool breeze outside, so I say this was a perfect night to eat outside. When we got our food, the burgers were fresh and hot and freaken good! I would say this cannot beat in n out but it does come in 2nd in my book!"}
{"text":"When I do not care about breaking my diet this is the burger I want. It is nice to have a burger that is dripping with flavor. It may not be the healthiest but it is a great burger. I also love the fat fries that you can get here. It is a little tiny inside with not many seats but there are seats outside if the weather is accommodating. So, I recommend that you indulge yourself once in a while. Try a Fatburger and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Today's burger adventure took me out to FatBurger, which is the closet burger joint to where I live. I figured it was time to review them here on my site. So I got in my car and drove the very short distance to get there.

I went in and for a late afternoon lunch and it was actually quiet busy, busier than I have seen it since it first opened. I walked up to the counter and took my order after a few questions and reading over the menu. The menu consists of chicken fingers, wings, chicken sandwiches and of course burgers. They have, like so many places these days, specialty burgers and regular burgers. Their regular burgers come in three sizes; BabyFat (4 oz), Fat (6 oz), and King (8 oz).

I ordered a double BabyFat (so 8 oz) with fries and a coke. On the burger I had the usual; mustard, ketchup, onion, tomato, pickle, lettuce. Once I ordered, they gave me a number and my drink and it was my turn to wait for the burger and fries. It took about five to seven minutes and while I waited I looked over at the semi-hidden grill area to see how they were cooked. The burger came out of a drawer, not frozen, fresh and red but already flattened. It's cooked on a griddle and covered with a metal skillet at times, it looked good as it cooked.

When I got my burger I dug into the fries first. They looked like generic frozen fries; they tasted like generic frozen fries. Not great but not terrible and nowhere near the best or okayest fries I have ever had (their curly fries are better but they are also generic frozen ones). I don't get why burger places open and pride themselves in their burgers that are fresh fresh fresh and then they just open a frozen bag of fries and serve those?

Let's move onto the burger, after all that's why we are here right? So I looked over the burger. The patties were nicely shaped and fit the white spongy bun perfectly. The lettuce was chopped and loaded on the burgers. The onions were diced and there was an ample amount. The pickles were small and few and far between and there was one rather large slice of tomato which seemed like the perfect amount.

Biting into the burger a slew of thoughts flooded into my head. let's talk the topping thoughts first. The lettuce was very crisp and juicy and maybe the best iceberg lettuce (shape, texture, freshness and juiciness factors) I have had on a burger ever. The pickles were tasty but like I said not enough, the onions were white onions and very flavourful and the tomato was juicy, not stringy and like I said, just the right amount. The toppings were gold.

The bun itself was a good bun. It was starchy, bouncy and held together well throughout the whole burger eating experience. It's not so gourmet but it's also no run of the mill burger bun you can buy at any grocer's. Bun plus toppings were A-okay.

Then there are the patties themselves, potentially the most important part of the whole burger. These patties tasted good but are they the best patties I have ever had? No, no they are not. They taste fresh but they also taste like day old fresh. Sure, they haven't been frozen but they don't taste like they were made to order, something other places do a very good job of. They taste like they were preformed and were sitting in the drawer for many an hour. Still not a bad taste and very similar to Johnny Rocket's. Their texture was a little on the tough side when you chewed; they could be ground a little finer. They stayed juicy and dripping the whole time I ate them; always a good thing.

So how was the overall experience? It was very satisfying and I would return to this place again. In fact, I have returned numerous times. It's not the best burger in the city but it's very decent. It is very similar to Johnny Rocket's (better and fresher toppings here), and the price point is virtually identical. This burger ran me fifteen and change and that's just a single (or double baby). Burger wise, these places are very very similar and for that Fat Burger gets the same rating. I'll be back here soon but it's no Five Guys, who does what they do but better.

{"text":"Bad service at this location.
Preface: went in mid-afternoon, there was no line and only 3 people eating in the dining room, so no reason to have provided us with better service.

My friend and I went in and were discussing what each one of us would order right in front of the cashier. Not that she needed to eavesdrop, but she should have been aware or attentive enough to realize that we were each ordering something.

My friend ordered first. Right after the cashier took their order, she left to start making it. we tried to call her back, but she just carried on at the grill. We literally stood at the register for at least 5 minutes, I saw her glancing up a couple of times - didn't think to wonder why we were still standing there, staring at her? Good customer service would have been to ask if we needed anything else, but this did not happen. We were fed up, and my friend just wanted a refund for the meal instead... not that any team members or manager were coming over to help us.

Finally, a different team member noticed us waiting and came over. We told him about how I was never able to place my order and that my friend just wanted a refund. He tried to tell me he could make it right then and there, but we just wanted to leave. He gave my friend a PARTIAL refund, which my friend noticed after we left.. and I have not returned since. I believe my friend made a comment on the actual website of Fatburger, but not sure what occurred after (if anything even occurred). Buuut as for me, I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I really like coming here. The food is always good and consistant. Its made right in front of you while you wait. It takes a few minutes, but is worth it. The staff is always friendly as well. We had more than exceptional service this evening from Natalie and will be back!"}
{"text":"I like the concept... quality burgers with several ingredient options. Good decore, friendly staff, cooking seemed to go well, but ingredients seemed a bit stale."}
{"text":"The portions they deliver are little smaller then what I thought it is good and they are efficient 
They remembered everything as well all in all a great delivery"}
{"text":"It seems like not so long ago, The Fatburger brand was blowing up, and expansion seemed endless... 10 years later, and Fatburger almost seems like a relic of the past, and isn't the first place people think of when it's.. BURGERTIME. Thanks to a few fantastic Groupons, I've returned to Fatburger, a few times recently. Really impressed! I admit to being a glutton, and enjoying *EVERYTHING* in excess, so The XXL Burger, Chili Cheese Fries, and Lemonade totez hit the spot.. GIANT TASTY MEAL... Even without a Groupon, the price isn't too horrible, and with one, it's an absolute steal! The staff is fab, and friendly, and while the interior decor is modern retro, it's.. now.. really outdated modern retro, and needs to be remodern retrofied. :) 
Give Fatburger another whirl! I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"The best burger place in my opinion I didn't think it was gonna be as good as it was. Skinny fries and burger all day everyday."}
{"text":"Went to Fatburger with our family tonight and will not return. 

Average food. The burgers were average. The lettuce was wilted, the tomato was green, and nothing outstanding about the flavor. I'd say better options nearby are Joe's farm grill, In-n-out, or Culvers. 

Cleanliness was average. The floor was a little sticky and the beverage area was kept very neat. The kitchen appeared clean. 

Service was below average/horrible. The cashier was very unpleasant. We all ordered at the same time and the first half of the food came out about 15 minutes prior to the 2nd part. It was pretty slow. By the time we got the fries they were cold. The staff literally acted like they were a bunch of highschoolers who were annoyed that there were any customers who interrupted their hangout. 

I know this sounds harsh...it is. My experience was absolutely horrible. We will not be back and I don't recommend that you should either."}
{"text":"Wow this burger is flavourless and overpriced.  If i didnt throw away my receipt in disgust, I would of posted it.  For $10.15, all I got was a single burger with cheese and bacon. Even the bacon had no flavour... Wow... Honestly a double quarter pounder from McDonalds is far better then this burger.  The only thing going for this place was the excellent customer service, but that doesnt change the price or taste, so 1 star for you Fatburger.  Then again I was the only person there, so customer service better be on point. Save your money please... This is a BS burger."}
{"text":"Only come here if you want cold food with nowhere to sit. 45 minute wait for a freaking milkshake"}
{"text":"Food/quality:
Great juicy burgers with tiny fries. It is fast food, but definitely a great deal especially late at night in Vegas after having some drinks during the evening. 

Service:
Service here is what I had a problem with. When I ordered for my boyfriend and myself, I had to repeat the order several times to the man at the register. He seemed to have trouble understanding our orders. For example, when stating that I wanted everything except tomatoes on my hamburger, he placed the order with tomatoes only. After continuously trying to have our order input correctly, I still had to walk up to the people preparing the food to have the order changed to what we wanted.

Atmosphere:
Interesting crowd. I remember there being a drunk girl falling all over the place in line. The bathroom here was not worth using, so I waited until heading back to our hotel.

Value:
Inexpensive quick meal, especially after you have already had a huge dinner elsewhere earlier in the evening followed by drinks."}
{"text":"I thought I would really like this place, but I just don't find anything really special. 

The burgers and fries are just so-so. Pretty pricey for a burger joint even for Vegas standards!

Good that it's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Had this during my last day in Vegas.  It was the best hungover meal ever! I had the medium burger and the onion rings.  The bad part about this place, the wait is kinda long and the workers yell really loud.  Not really cool when you've partied too hard the night before and you just want to enjoy your meal in peace. haha"}
{"text":"The place was clean.  The staff was nice.  I wasn't paying $12 for a burger combo.  Got a small burger ala cart for $5.  It was four bites.  See ya never.  Plenty of other burger joints everywhere."}
{"text":"Tasty burger ... I ordered the small burger with everything, added cheese and bacon with their skinny cut fries. Burger was very enjoyable, juicy and seemed to have some flavor ... although I wonder if I am really tasting the burger with all those condiments. The bacon definitely had good flavor. Their fries were nice and crispy too, could have used a smidge more salt. I will say the small burger is pretty small for the price, $12 when all said and done. All in all good but nothing about it makes me wish we had a Fatburger in Chicago. To be honest I think the last burger I had at Five Guys was a lot better."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas last year, and I'm still thinking about the burgers here!

The place was right across the street from my hotel - so convenient!  I passed by this place a few times, with no intentions of going inside.  At around 3AM on a Wednesday, after a great time on the strip, was heading back to the hotel, and I was hungry.  It was practically empty inside.

I'm so happy I went here!!  I had the Small (Baby Fat) Fatburger with cheese, bacon and an egg. DELICIOUS!!  I'm drooling right now...  The skinny fries were great too.

I even made a trip to In-N-Out sometime the next day - my first time there actually.  Although it was good, I preferred Fatburger, and made more trips here instead!

The location was convenient, and the people that worked there were really nice, funny actually.  People have said that they have encountered shady customers.  However, I went there a few times between 1-4AM, and all I saw were tourists, like myself. Maybe I was just lucky.

I miss you Fat Burger!"}
{"text":"Hahaha, good times here! 

Ordered our food, got a seat by the front windows, and promptly fell asleep for a short little nap.

When I came to, my burger was still sitting there in tact on my tray, but my sister was still nowhere to be found. Turns out she was still in the bathroom, out of it, and having vomited. 

Gross! 

when she recovered, we managed to eat our food slowly, and oddly enough, in peace in our seats by the entrance. 

No one bothered us. We didn't have anyone rowdy being obnoxious. 

Food was solid -- for a burger and fries. Can't go wrong. Service was fast. Guess we came at a time when there wasn't any line."}
{"text":"worse place to get fast food they take tgere sweet ass time.  they litterally don't have nothing ready for u till 30 mins..  never will i go back.."}
{"text":"FAT BURGER CORPORATE ALERT: BRAND BEING TARNISHED! Ive loved Fat Burger since the first day I enjoyed their turkey burger with egg and Mr Pibb. This is the only Fat Burger I've seen look this bad.Do not think this is how all Fat Burgers are operated. Everyone I've been to was nearly perfect.  What happened to corporate quality control? Neon sign broke, dirt building up from neglect, no one greeted me and manager rushed order, TV broke playing nonsense. Trays of old food sitting out, chairs, straw wrappers, and other stuff all over while employees walking by with no care to clean it up. Only the manager and lady working not sure but looks like they are trying to save money but its going to end up costing them customers. Food was good but more care could have been put into stalking the burger so it was even.  It's sad they don't care anymore..."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Botched our order after we were waiting over 30 minutes and wanted us to pay again.  There was literally no one here when we ordered and they still managed to mess it up. This is probably my third and last time going to this place.  Previous times had lackluster service but at the very least the burger was what I was expecting. I get that this place isn't meant to be great service but considering at the time the place was vacant the least they could have done is make an order right."}
{"text":"Delicious hamburgers!
Stayed at the MGM and walked over here to get a good hamburger for a good price. I got the skinny fries & medium burger and it was simple and delicious. The BF got the chili cheese fries and said they were really good. Chili isn't my thing so I didn't try em. The service was good and fast and honestly I'm from California.. The Bay Area & I think this place is better then our In N Out."}
{"text":"Burger was HUGE, tasty, inexpensive, open 24 hour, service was friendly, a definite go to spot after a crazy night on the strip.  I love how there is a veggie burger option.  The veggie burger tasted so good.  This burger joint is special compared to in and out.  You can add an egg on the burger for $1.  yay more protein!!!"}
{"text":"first burger during the day was a little on the dry side, but still tasty.  next burgers were at 5am, and ordered the \"baby fat\" this time.  basically a smaller burger.  these were very tasty and good.  the steak fries are also a nice addition to any burger meal.  btw, this location is open 24/7."}
{"text":"The burgers here are decent. Meat is tender and there are a decent selections of toppings. I got the fat fries and didn't really care for them, they didn't seem crispy enough. The prices here are pretty high for what it is, if it came down to spending 10 bucks on a burger and fries I'd go to five guys first, in-n-out second, smashburger 3rd and fatburger fourth. Overall, I do like that they have shakes, like any good burger shack should, but I don't factor that in because to me, when a place has the word burger in the title that's all that matters. I might stop by again if I feel the need for a 1000 calorie burger near my house, otherwise, I'll be driving past this overpriced burger stand more often than not."}
{"text":"For the most part the food here is wonderful...pretty pricey but worth it for the most part. I'm not crazy on the wings, especially the hot, they are not hit at all! I would highly recommend this place despite my opinion of the wings."}
{"text":"For strip fast food, it was actually really really good. Thank god for the 32oz beer option as well."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Disgusting!!! Not clean!!! We arrived expecting to have an amazing burger, however our visit took a different turn. This place is dirty!! Nothing was clean, soda lids were missing, no napkins in dispenser, ketchup was old and bubbly. I will complain directly to the company. Did not enjoy the meal"}
{"text":"I've tried giving this place a few chances but they screw up orders everytime never  have got my order right since the first time I went I actually used to like fat burger"}
{"text":"Don't expect anything remotely good from this place. They're the most absolutely disgusting, dry, overlooked crappy patties EVER made!  It's like eating sand, sawdust and meal worms all rolled into one. This is the most sorry pathetic, atrocious excuse for what was written on the menu as a burger.  Voted best burger, MY ASS! That review was from 8 years ago! Definitely don't waste your time or money!!  You'll find something better to eat, I promise."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken burger, onion rings, and a drink. Talking about freakin good.! Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. I loved that it wasn't oily or greasy. The onion rings batter is thin and flakey but trust me it's good.!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Red meat is not my thing so it's very rare I am open to eating burgers but this time it was so worth the risk! If only there was one in my town I would have a huge problem. The fries were good as well. Filling meal that may require a nap afterwards lol."}
{"text":"Fat Burger is good, but not better than In N Out. I like the fact that they're open 24 hours. The burgers here are not as great as other burger joints I have been to. The prices were pretty high too. If I'm in Las Vegas and it is late at night and I'm craving a hamburger I'll go here. I had the triple king which was humongous, i couldn't even finish it!  =O"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome!  This Location is convenient off of US 60. I eat here often when seeing a movie next door at AMC Mesa Grand 24.  I wanted to give this location 5 stars, but could not because I have not always had good service.  The service quality depends on when you eat at this location.  Usually the service is fast & friendly, but if you come here when the high school kids are working, service usually is ok at best, if even that good.  Overall very good except for a couple of times of rude service from the teenagers.  I reported the rude teenagers to the manager on another visit and he said he would look into the situation.  Service lately has been excellent."}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of fatburgers always hits the spot. I had to review them at 3 stars on this trip due to tables being dirty, foul smell, and ladies bathroom overflowing while there are less than a handful of customers. Food was however up to par with the rest of locations. I would drive through next time."}
{"text":"3am, and a night filled with way too many drinks, way too many bets, and great times with friends and family.  Where to get a greasy fix?  Fatburger.    This one is located within the Red Rock Casino Resort, and is open to fill your needs 24/7.  The Big Fat Deal with Cheese and Fried Egg was heavenly, especially considering the state of mind I was in.  Nice!"}
{"text":"It's the best burger in Vegas but I say that because it's the only burger I have and ever will eat in Vegas (I am from Chicago). Last summer I was visiting and I made my friends walk from the Belaggio to Fatburger listening to them whine and complain about the distance the whole way. To me its no big deal to walk that far...its not even that far. But after we ate they agreed it was worth it. I wish I knew what spcies they use in the burgers...."}
{"text":"I'll start with the only plus - the fries are great. Tried both the curly fries and the fat fries. The curly fries were very crisp on the outside - warm on the inside. The fat fries are a basic steak-fry - but cooked to perfection. No complaints on the fries

Service - The kids running the place were pleasant and nice; but they were just going through the motions. This store has the cooks calling out the orders - a la Startbucks - but there was no real enthusiasm in their voices. It really seemed that they were mouthing the words because they were getting paid minimum wage to do so.

Burgers - The burgers are cooked fresh; but, they are, for the most part, tasteless. I'd cut them some slack if they were dishing out burgers for $2; but at $7 to $10, I expect a lot more. All burgers are cook to well done and the toppings were bland. I tried the mushroom / swiss burger. The mushrooms tasted steamed and no sauted as I'd expect. They were over cooked and mushy - not firm and juicy. The buns were slightly stale and broke apart while eating the burger. This just isn't a $7 burger

Lot's of room for improvement her"}
{"text":"Register was slow. The dining room was nasty. There was garbage all over tables where messy. I had to clean my own table. Outside area was mess the garbage was full. 4 workers and no one is cleaning or washing hands."}
{"text":"Great late night fast place to eat. People usually go there for the burgers, but the hot dogs are surprisingly good! Give them a try!!"}
{"text":"I Wanted to try something new so I headed to this fat burger location. The place was empty but I like how they played oldies in the restaurant! The burger was good except they jammed my patty with a lot of pickles! I can stand 1 or 2 pickles but not a whole avalanche of them in my patty. Their regular fries tasted ok except some tasted like cardboard...."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The outside bar is fun and right on the strip so entertainment all day and night.  Bartenders are amazingly cool.  Ask for Meg she is great!"}
{"text":"I am not sure that this place can compete.  I am all about hamburgers, 20.00 hamburgers and 1.00 hamburgers.  I have had them all.  This place is home of the 6.00 hamburger and for 9.99 deal here is the deal:

a. Menu - So easy.  Pick from just the basic Fatburger from Small to XXL which has like 4 patties....  They also have chicken, turkey, veggie burgers, hot dogs, chicken strips and salad too. 

I had a medium fat burger.  It was about 6.19 and by time I had the combo with drink and fries. 

b.  The taste - Uneventful Very edible, just not a journey, not orgasmic and nothing special... It was just very edible.  This is my problem.  For this price, I would rather have an In and Out Burger. Way tastier, so juicy, and the fries are amazing.  Here at Fatburger, everything was just okay.

So, while it was pretty decent, here is  how I would rank things.  If you want an awesome adventure and wonderful burger, go to Bachi Burger or to Capital Grille.  For 20.00 you get the best and you know it by the taste and juicy mess factor.  If you want best value, go to In and Out.  If you are in the middle and want a generic experience, then there are plenty of places like Five guys, Fat Burger, Smash Burger and all the same.

GK says, not bad, but I won't be a regular customer.

PS - Service at this place is really great!"}
{"text":"This was my first expeience with Fatburger. I had always wanted to try it (most because of IceCube. . ) anyway i ordered mine without the sauce and tomatoes. The meat was really good, great flavor, cooked well. On the greasy side but hey! you knew what you were getting into when you ordered at \"FAT burger\" lets be honest.

I loved it. But I know this is an occasional type place. This location is inside the casino so it was either here or Subway. If you havnet had it. try it. and get the sauce on the side so you can try it but you arent stuck with it. i wasnt a fan myself but you might be. ."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place... First time I visited it was not so great, so I decided to give it a second chance. However, I ended up waiting for my order for 30 minutes in the drive thru, when I finally got home, my order was wrong and they forgot to add the extra mushrooms that I requested and PAID for! Ugh, get it together Fat Burger!"}
{"text":"Another successful yelp event! Thank you Kris for organizing. Fatburger is worth checking out if you are in the thornhill area. And there is plenty of parking in the back. I ordered the \"baby\" burger which is exactly the same AAA angus beef used for the regular burgers except smaller sized. It was the perfect amount in my opinion and \"only\" about 591 calories (excluding cheese) according to the nutritional info :) 

You order your food at the counter and they give you a number, tell you to have a seat and bring your food to you. Nice! 

You can add a variety of sides (e.g. chili, guacamole, egg, etc.) but the best value is 2 for $1.99 so I opted for the fried egg and the Canadian cheddar. I was disappointed that they were out of the pepper jack cheese and also the free onion rings but didn't let it get me down! 

The burger was tasty and flavourful. I was pleased :) 

Fries, poutine and Cajun chips were a nice addition that we all shared. Standard fare in my opinion. The poutine was nice and hot and tasty.

The baby burger with the 2 sides came to about 9 bucks without drink or sides. 

Worth it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Best snack pack for our cravings:  kid combos with Nathan hotdog, yam fries, strawberry milkshake, and 5 mini donuts. They are really tasty and crispy."}
{"text":"It's 1138, and I was just told this establishment was closed because the cook already cleaned the grill.. Shout out to the owner, your employees should be held accountable for not following procedures. Close early if you're unwilling to serve customers past 1130 when your CLOSING TIME is 12pm. #drunkandfrustrated.  The date in question is  Wednesday November 15th,2017 if anyone is interested in further research."}
{"text":"personally i would prefer In-and-Out Burgers but the line at the In-and-Out's drive-thru was terrible so I stopped by Fatburger to get my burger fix.  Sadly, I had to wait 20 minutes for just one (1) chicken burger and some Fat Fries to be made, while the restaurant was widely empty!  I didnt understand what took the kitchen so long to assemble a burger, but service was just super slow. period.  

Would I go back?  Nope! The Hawaiian chicken burger was just alright and the Fat Fries were meh.....meaning that both were soooooo not worth the wait!!!  Price was not cheap; total 14 bucks. GRRRRRRRRRR i felt furious."}
{"text":"I've always loved fat burger every time i come to las vegas, but this time they gotten my order wrong. As i ordered my burger i told the cashier no bun and ended up with a bun anyways, and i didn't want to send it back because i don't know what the cooks will do to my food if i send my food back. I good thing about it was my oreo cookie shake was soooooo delicious, don't know what type of ice cream they use for they shakes, but it was very good. Just might return for a shake next time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is a fan of Fatburger, so I decided to go to this location to surprise her with some food. I quickly discovered, however, that Fatburger, this location in particular, is a very mixed bag.

First and foremost, the biggest flaw: NO DRIVE-THRU WINDOW. In this day and age, I didn't think they were still making fast food restaurants that required you to get out of your car. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that this is a big mistake.

Secondly, the service is very hit and miss. One time I asked for the thin/skinny fries, and they put the larger steak fries in my bag anyway (which if you ask me, aren't as good.) One time they tried taking my order when they weren't even standing at the register, and needless to say I wound up repeating it several times. 

Another thing that is really weird about this location is their jukebox. It brags about free music, yet the LCD appears to be covered up. On top of that, it even has money/credit card slots. Seriously? Having access to free music would be a great way to kill time while waiting for my order, but it looks to me like this damn thing doesn't even work.

And another big flaw.... the PRICES. For a medium burger and a small  order of fries, its TEN DOLLARS. And this is WITHOUT A DRINK! The food at Fatburger is excellent, and I believe they would be justified in asking slightly more for their items.... but this is ridiculous.

If you MUST eat at a Fatburger, go to one with a drive-through - and be prepared to pay more than you might want to. This is a place that has the potential to be great, but this one needs a drive-thru, improved service, and lowered prices before I give them anything above 2/5."}
{"text":"I don't know how else to put this but I picked up a burger here after a little gambling at the casino and when I got home and unwrapped it............

There was a very long black hair in between the bottom bun and meat. Thank goodness I add extra mayo. So gross. Love the franchise but could never eat at this location again."}
{"text":"This place was a MESS. Walked in and waited 15 minutes for my order to be taken (there was only 2 people ahead of me). Apparently they were having system issues and their computers were down so they were writing down orders and telling  the customers the bill would be brought to the tables. I ordered the original burger and a side of skinny and a side of fat fries. The food was brought to my table pretty fast. The burger was okay the fries were also okay. After the check was brought over to my table I got up and went to the register to pay and the manager standing there tells me to wait for the cashier because she's in the bathroom. So I wait. 10 minutes pass and I'm still waiting and he's still standing there trying to reboot the computers. 15 minutes pass and I'm still standing there without acknowledgement as 3 more employees are trying to reboot the computers. At 25 minutes the manager says: \"so are you paying cash?\" And I say \"YES\" and he says \"Ohhhh\" . So you're telling me I waited 25 long minutes standing up waiting for your system to work when allll along I could have payed cash? The least the manager could of done was apologized for wasting 25 minutes of my time but that wasn't done nor any sort of discount was applied. Talk about horrible business. Fat Burger is a Never Burger for me!"}
{"text":"This is a tricky review to write as I do enjoy Fatburger products but the service is inconsistent. Often times they forget to add the extras that you order for your burger. On several occasions I have ordered bacon on my burger and have gotten home to discover no bacon was ever added. About half of the time something is wrong. The staff is friendly and helpful but many of them are not properly trained. Often the credit/debit machine is out of order. Compared with In-N-Out Burger the wait time is very long. Sometimes I have had to wait 20 to 30 minutes for one burger, not to mention that the store wasn't even crowded! I would hate to see what would happen if a lunch crowd came in. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"Has to be the best burger. Add a fried egg to make it even better. Love the fat fries and onion rings too. But its the burgers you have to try. Everything tastes so fresh. Their is a size for everyone. If you think you can try the XXXL challenge. My brother did in April (a little disappointed that is picture isn't up as promised with the challenge). They have shakes and an outdoor bar as well. The best fat burger we've been too!"}
{"text":"Came here last week with my lovely girlfriend in early July 2015. I chose this place because I have been looking for a nice burger wrapped in lettuce!

As soon as we walked in we thought that everything looked good in terms of food and we only saw the promotional stuff. We walked deeper into the restaurant and looked at the menu. This menu was a bit overwhelming and I was entirely sure where to begin to look. The burgers are also missing descriptions of what's in them from what I recall. I just winged it and ordered the burger that sounded the biggest and it appears that I made a good decisions. Our total was around $30 because we both ordered a combo. After paying, we were given an order number.

My girl ordered the baby fatburger and I ordered the double king supreme burger in a lettuce wrap. She is extremely picky but enjoyed this burger. It came with a multitude of free toppings. My burger, on the other hand, came with two huge patties and all of the free toppings offered!

We proceeded to the seating area and our food arrived after 10 to 15 minutes. Even though this was a fast food joint, there was a waitress that delivered the food to us and took care of cleaning the seating area. She asked how the food was after we finished, which was more customer service than we expected at such a place.

Overall, the service was great, the place was clean, and the food was amazing! We will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Food: tasty Experience: ghetto (the bad kind)

My wife loves the Turkey Burger (TURKEY FAT!) and I, the Boca (BOCA!). I think most people eat burgers for the condiments and Fat Burger is evidence to support -- try a fried egg on yours, mmmm!

Their shakes are tasty too and my kids won't shut up about them. 

Here's the ghetto part:

Stuff breaks and they don't fix it; to the point where I think they take pride in how long they can go without having to fix things. We've been going to this location for 3-4 years and the juke box is completely unplayable more often than not (don't get me started on never-once-working jukebox and forever-broken-covered-with-a-traffic-cone-barstool at the Desert Ridge Fat Burger). 

I wish they'd bring back the real lemonade, too. Minute Maid is not lemonade."}
{"text":"We thought the store was closed not really well lit but saw the open sign. Burgers were fantastic onion rings excellent. A little but of time to get food but worth the wait. Ordered both without cheese both came with cheese due to long travel day we ate them.  Good burgers!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a Fatburger (we do not have them in TX) and I must say I was very pleased with this place. The burgers were really good. I had the turkey burger on wheat and the burger held it's own. The onion rings here are the bomb digity. They were so flaky and damn near melted in my mouth. The guy at the register was very polite and helpful. There was also a young lady working there that helped us decide on what to order. The restroom was really clean and I would recommend this place to grab a quick bite, especially for the price. 

FYI - They play great music, old school R&B."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!!!! The people are so nice!!! And the burgers are a great way to fill your tummy!"}
{"text":"Talk about bombay late night grub in the city that never sleeps, well if you go to Fat Burger then you came to the right place. I love it because its just a down right good greasy fast food burger. I prefer it over Five Guys and In and Out. Love the face that you can get cheese bacon and a fried egg on the burger. Its a tradition to hit up this place every time I am in vegas.

Always a repeat offender in the land of Lost Wages!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe It was the fact that I was starving and it was 3 in the morning, but that was one of the best burgers I ever had!

Unfortunately, the dining area is disgusting (I was afraid to look at the kitchen), the staff look like they all just got out of prison and don't seem too concerned with customer satisfaction. But despite this, I would totally go back."}
{"text":"I hope there was something less than a 1 star rating.

WASTE OF MONEY, STAY OUT OF IT......!!!!

we spend $70 dlls. on hamburgers (5 people), $70 dollars for food for 5 is nothing, specially at Vegas, but when you just throw your money down the drain, to me that's a fortune,

even the $1 cheap Mcdonald's burgers are way better that those served at this location, DRY and COLD buns, flavor-less patty's, COLD onion rings, lousy service, orders taken  wrongly after a 40 mins waiting, no soda refills offered, it took another 20 mins.at the end just to get the tab.............

MY TIP:............$ .000000 of a penny

the place wasn't even full, so that is not an excuse, it is on a great location on the strip,
tables and bar to eat ouside but not even that saves the experience.

AGAIN, STAY OUT OF IT......................."}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest Fat burger I've been to.   We walked in 40 mins after opening and all the tables were dirty.   Walking up to order the person working was chewing food and the two homeless guys in the booth when walking in....didn't help this review.   We had to clean our own table!!!   Food was normal"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, love the fries, but the deal maker for me? The shakes. OMG Amazing. Service was fast, food was good. Tables could have been wiped down more often, but all in all, so worth the stop. Open 24 hours. Nice casual place to stop in and grab a bite on the strip."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. Our first experience we didn't know that we can make your own burger. We just pick the one from the menu. 

My boyfriend order XL burger and he added so much stuff and different sauces. Great idea in added whatever. 

I'm glad they had a fatburger at the hotel. We stayed at hotel for couple nights and it was a great place to get a late grub."}
{"text":"This is around the corner from a Five Guys, but we went here because they have Maui Banana shakes.  Don't ask me what's in it, we tried to figure it out (Sure we could have asked, but yana.....).  Definitely banana, and some other kind of \"exotic\" flavoring like a hint of coconut or mango or something.  I was hoping for something along the lines of a Sonic pineappple milkshake (BOMB, btw), but it wasn't.

You get your choice of skinny or steak fries.  I got the skinny, and noticed they have an extra coating of crustiness, like Burger King or McD's.  I like them better than In 'N Out fries, although I worry about what makes up that extra coating.

I asked them if they could do a 'protein style' burger without the bun, and they were happy to do so.  They basically put the patty on top of all the fixin's, and put the whole thing in a cardboard container (like the fry containers at In 'N Out).  

I like that they have different Tabasco sauces for you to choose from too, and saw a bottle of A-1 Steak Sauce on the counter too.

This place wasn't busy, maybe because of Five Guys.  But fine with me, I'll go back to this place.

Oh, and they have free wifi."}
{"text":"I did not try the burgers. I only had their oreo shake and it was delicious! If you are looking for something sweet late at night, do not hesitate and go to fat burger for a shake."}
{"text":"The burger is made with mediocre blend of meat. No significant char on the patty. The condiments were unmemorable.

Go to the InNOut on the Strip if you want a good burger. Fatburger was decidedly mediocre and overpriced."}
{"text":"The wait can be a little lengthy once the throngs of tourists all get a mean buzz working, but every time I've been in here, the food has been some real good stuff. The burger is fine in its own right, and anywhere you can add egg to a burger wins points in my book. The staff is pretty cool too, they always seem to be having a good time despite wage slavery in servitude of a bunch of cheap drunks. One of the older Mexican dudes that brings people their food challenged us gringos to a pepper-eating contest (he won). It was fun at the time, but later on, burning sensations led me to realize I should not have eaten such a large quantity of spicy peppers. Please learn from my mistake if he challenges you too."}
{"text":"Pretty mellow spot. I like sitting outside in the bar area. I like coming here to have a few drinks before I do anything else. The staff are real cool here. If you're lucky, you might run into their happy hour vouchers . I'm always there and you should too!"}
{"text":"A little girl sits happily for a picture with cheeks puffed up filled with food. It's fat fries and sticking out of her face. 

Fast forward 16 years and I'm sitting with the BF late night at a fatburger and there was no happy grinning girl here.

He ordered a medium burger, no veggie toppings, add cheese, add egg, add chili. 

I got a medium with everything and added egg and cheese.

We shared fat fries.

What we ended up getting was two medium burgers with everything topping, one with egg.

No chili, no cheese, no other egg. Well, I look at the receipt later and we never ordered the extra egg or cheese on mine, but we did get charged for chili cheese for the BFs burger so it was the right order for him (for the most part). I guess the extra egg part didn't get heard for his. Still, the chili cheese was he was mainly after. 

Two very different burgers and was the only order on the pas....really, it wasn't hard to make them correct. I think it's a lack of attention to detail since the order wasn't made right (it was dry, overcooked) and then  the burger wasn't made even to what the ticket said. Sure we can have went back to get a refire, but to go back to the restaurant and then wait again for new burgers- we didn't have the time. Went for fast food since we needed fast food. 

The BF was sick. When he's sick he can drive me nuts about food and when food isn't right and he is hungry and sick he gets so pissed and then makes him feel worse. 

What an awful dinner this was.

I have been a loyal fatburger fan since I was a kid. It actually was my reward for a good spelling test in elementary since I loved it so much. As an adult, I prefer grabbing a turkey burger with egg over any other fast food burger. Most of the LV casino locations really don't care. This is not the first time I felt it was less than stellar (usually overcooked) but this was the worse service so far.

 After tonight, I think I am done being a fan. Goodbye Fatburger. Hello In-N-Out, thanks for being consistent."}
{"text":"Satisfying fresh drive thru food. 

Nuff said. 

I know a lot of people like In N Out, but I'm going to say it that I have a special spot for Fatburger as the late night choice. I mean a double double animal style is good, but sometimes I just want other options and I like the fries a lot more here. My favorite is the turkey burger  with all toppings or try it with some egg. A plus that burgers come in sizes, sometimes that late I just want a baby burger. 

I didn't know there was even one near me until I drove to Big Dog Draft House. Yay! Looks like we have another late night dinner pick up in the NW, we have very few options past 11pm when we have our night owl schedule."}
{"text":"I never knew they had crispy chicken sandwiches but they are really good and cooked fresh.  I have heard the orders have gotten mixed up and the service can be slow from time to time, especially due to the noise from the casino, but the atmosphere is fun and it's a fun way to get away for a qwik meal"}
{"text":"I always make it a point to get Fatburger at least once when I'm in Vegas. Just ate there and as always the food was great. The fat fries are the best anywhere. Got my usual burger with everything but pickles and it was perfect.  My only complaint is the prices and the long wait, which was strange considering hardly anybody was there at the time."}
{"text":"I went to Fatburger twice on my recent trip to Las Vegas. I was seriously tired of the buffets and loved the burger here. Got a king burger, with onion rings and a banana shake (which was to die for).  I will be back here on my next visit to this location on the strip."}
{"text":"Good God what's not to love about this place?

December and it's cool outside but they've got the warming torches lit outside and it keeps the outdoor area nice and warm.  TV is on with football and they have a full bar!

Burgers are straight up off da hook yo.  Like a homemade burger patty all misshapen but hot, cooked to perfection and delicious.  Fat Fries are pure nosh-a-licious!  Dip 'em in the chili.  Do it now!

Beer + Burger = Dinner for me last night... and lunch for me in about an hour today :-).

Beer = $7.  Burger = $7.  $14 worth of pure delicious goodness.  Better than either In&Out or 5 Guys in my opinion.

Go, eat, chillax, and people-watch."}
{"text":"Ok first off the crew at this location is hard working and cool, my food came out in less then 10m, place is clean. Food was hot and tasty. Plus fat burger is now offering gluten free buns that's great!"}
{"text":"We got a Groupon to try this place out. $16 for two cheese burgers and two fries. We also got an order of chicken strips which were $10.50 for 6 pieces. 

The restaurant is modern meets classic diner, the menu is large and has a lot of choices. There are several posters around the restaurant sporting claims that fatburger ingredients, flavours, freshness, etc.. are better than other burger chains in Canada but I'm not sure I'm convinced! 

The burger itself probably gets the lowest score, the patty was a bit dry, unfortunately and the toppings and bun weren't particularly amazing, although they do offer a nice selection of free toppings, including onion rings. The fries were ok, despite the claim that they're hand-cut, skin on, they actually kind of tasted like from-the-freezer fries. They weren't terrible, they just didn't have that rustic fresh fry taste like you'd get from a chip truck. The saving grace were really the chicken strips, a bit costly at $10.50 for 6 pieces, they are hand breaded right in front of your eyes and fried to a golden crisp. They were flavourful and crunchy on the outside and the chicken was moist on the inside. We tried the honey mustard and honey garlic sauces and both were above average, the honey garlic was particularly delicious. If we were to go back I'd go for those. 

The service was a bit strange, I'm not sure if the girl at the front desk was new or had an English language barrier but she had to keep asking another associate for help whenever we asked for anything which slowed the process a bit. It wasn't bad but wasn't particularly engaging

I don't think I'd be back to be honest, definitely worth a try if you're in the area and are able to get the Groupon deal, otherwise I'd stick with five guys."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of fast food places but i must say i really like Fatburger..

I ordered the Turkey burger with everything but the pickles and skinny fries.. all for $11+ kinda pricey but it is worth it. They have many toppings for your burgers such as eggs and bacon.. i skipped on that part since im on a diet.. 

Overall, If i wasnt on a diet would love to try the real beef burgers instead of the turkey burger even thou the turkey burger was really good!

The location of this Fatburger was inside Green Valley Ranch Casino, kinda loud environment and i didnt like how the tables was next to a trash can and how they allowed smoking .. oh wells what do you expect your inside a casino

overall experience was great and rated it a 4 star.."}
{"text":"Paid $15 for a combo meal that was not good at all. They got my order wrong, even though I said something at the window to correct the mistake. Barely got any fries at all, and the shake I order was basically water. Not worth the time, and way too overpriced. I'll stick with In-n-Out or Five Guys."}
{"text":"I am usually a fan of Fatburger, but the location on Fort Apache is absolutely the worst. On a Sunday afternoon with no one in the restaurant it took us half an hour to get our cheeseburgers and fries. The staff was incompetent and is a negative reflection on the company as a whole."}
{"text":"Good news! FatBurger has veggie burgers now! Who knew?? My boyfriend kept asking if they did, and I always told him no.  Then today we went in just to check and much to my surprise, they do! Woo hoo!  They're $4.29 and it's a Boca burger, but it's just fun to actually have that option when you want fast food.  Most fast food places don't offer veggie burgers unfortunately.  

The veggie burger was really good and the best part is you get to choose if you want skinny fries, steak fries, curly fries or onion rings with it. Yum. Not the healthiest meal you could have, but it was damn good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"After playing poker for hours, I visited Fat Burger looking for one BIG burger, and I definitely got it. I'm curious how would I feel after eating their XXXL Burger, but the one I ate was very tasty and big, plus the onion rings were awesome. Big recommendation for Fat burger!"}
{"text":"Giving this a 5 because Fat Burger now sells the impossible burger and it was out of this world delicious!!! the gentlemen working the counter was extremely nice and we were served in about 15 min or less."}
{"text":"Last night in Vegas and I wanted to eat something that I could enjoy. This place was a little pricey, but the burger was great. It was huge and made fresh, as well as the fries. The burger could of used some kind of flavoring or some seasoning, it had that flavor of being cooked at home on the stove taste to it. But other than that it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Hey Hey Hey!

It's Fatburger!

Naa, naa, naa, gonna have a Fatburger!

Naa, naa, naa, gonna have a Fatburger!

Hey kids!  When you have a taste for a burger don't mess around with that In n' Out, McDonalds, Wendy's or Burger King stuff!  

Fatburger will definitely satisfy the need for a delicious gooky burger.  I personally recommend the Baby Fat with bacon, cheese & grilled onions.  With a side of Fat Fries of course.

Fatburger really can't be lumped into the Fast Food burger class.  First of all, it's not fast.  Secondly, this is more of a good diner or hamburger grill burger you're getting.  Just a notch above the fast food places for just a bit more money."}
{"text":"Their turkey burger is one of the better ones I've had. The bun was nicely toasted and was a great alternative to a beef burger."}
{"text":"We decided to give this a try because it's location and time (it was early morning)  The service sucked and the food did as well. The burger was dry and the fries were soggy. We ordered 3 burgers, a side of fries, chili fries and 2 drinks that totaled to be about $43. I wish I could have just saved my money and went to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Many people tell me they prefer In-N-Out over Fat Burger (or any other burger for that matter). To them I say, to each his own. Me? I prefer big juicy, greasy burgers, not small \"clean\" burgers. When I'm eating a burger, it's not supposed to be healthy or good for me. That's why a FATBURGER wins in terms of taste, size, and overall satisfaction. With a order of Fat Fries and a Large Coke. Yeah, now that's heaven. You can keep your overated, non-burger tasting in-n-out \"burgers\". Now, someone needs to bring a franchise to San Francisco."}
{"text":"Fatburger is legendary! Open 24 hours on the Las Vegas strip, get the fat fries and a double king Fatburger with the works, what else could you possibly ask for in life?

The jukebox inside is great, the workers yell out in harmony to thank you if you leave a tip.

Fatburger is heaven in the desert!"}
{"text":"I don't get the Fatburger love.

Last night, after a looooong flight, my fiancé and I were desperate for something - ANYTHING - to eat.  We passed this Fatburger on the way home and decided to stop by.  We both got turkey burgers and cups of chili.  The chili had a strange, gritty texture.  The spices were incredibly strong... not in terms of being spicy, but more like it had LOTS of paprika or something in it.  One thing I can say about the chili was that it was served piping hot.  I hate lukewarm chili - it grosses me out.  So I guess that's something. 

When we got our burgers home, we found that neither one was cooked all the way through.  It wasn't just that they were pink like turkey burgers tend to be.  They oozed blood all over the paper and stained our buns a putrid pink color.  If it wasn't two in the morning, we would have taken them back and complained.  However, in our fatigued stupors, we downed the gritty chili and called it a night.

One thing I can say for certain is that we won't be back.  We can't afford to waste money on undercooked meat."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at Fatburger in about 12 years. Since I now live near the Green Valley Ranch and it was on Groupon I gave it a shot. BAD MOVE. Really bad. I can see why the Burger war has hurt this franchise. I ordered a half pound cheeseburger, Fat fries and a vanilla shake. I asked to PLEASE cook my burger medium which they said they would. The fries and shake were OK, nothing great but edible. The burger was well done and dry and looked like a quarter pound burger at best. I asked them to make me another and even the second burger was well done and dry. At this point I wasn't going to send it back again. I figured I would eat cause I was hungry and swallow my losses. BTW that order came to $16. I hardly call that fast food prices. Definitely my last time to any Fatburger with so many other excellent fast food burger places around such as Freddy's, In and Out, Habit Burger and Shake Shack. I apologize but my review was for the Fatburger in the Green Valley Ranch"}
{"text":"Extremely dissapointed ..... me and my fiance went for lunch. And ordered 2 xxl with specific items and extras and we pay for everything which was over 40 dollars.. which was fine cause we ordered extra things on it... but to pay for burgers and still have them not be what we ask for is ridiculous seriously whats the point in ordering something a specific way and they dont do it.Mind you they confirmed my order before I  paid and they still disregurded everything .And charged for things that they didn't do...will never come back to this location again..."}
{"text":"i'm pretty sure that this a chain, and i usually try to avoid fast food joints when i can, especially while on vacation. however, at 2:00 AM in the morning, anything open is fair game.

i was hurting for something greasy to calm my inebriated self. i had eaten merely hours before, and i even told myself not to eat too much else i would be hurting tomorrow. 

one medium size burger with chili [and a lot of stolen fries] later, i felt goooood. the burger reminded me of in-&-out. what probably gives it an interesting touch is the relish. not bad i guess.

this place even had live entertainment - drunk people causing commotion."}
{"text":"It's my first time at Fatburger. Months ago, I bought a Groupon and realized that it was going to expire in a day!

So, I visited the place after work. It's in a part of Thornhill that I hadn't been to. I was pleased to find a lot of parking. The restaurant is situated next to a Starbucks. Nice!

I went in and was promptly greeted. My order consisted of two Fatburgers with cheese and two orders of skinny fries. I also ordered a side of gravy. 

The burger was amazing. The ingredients were so fresh and the beef was seasoned nicely. I am frankly bored of fries, but the skinny fries are the perfect size for me. The gravy was tasty and accompanied the fries nicely. 

The menu is extensive. I will definitely go back to try more options, including the turkey and veggie burgers. I also love yam fries, so I will need to sample those. 

The service was fantastic. I sat there waiting for my order for perhaps six or eight minutes. My order was brought right to me and the nice woman even pushed my chair in after I had grabbed my order. I'd definitely recommend going there for a decent burger."}
{"text":"My first Fatburger experience! Check that one off my cheeseburgers list.

I was properly warned that it takes quite awhile to get the food, and man were my advisors correct. We pulled up to the drive-thru at around 4 pm and didn't get our food until about 4:27. But that's because they make it fresh, to-order so you're not getting burgers or fries that have been sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long. And yes, you can taste the freshness in the product. 

Burger was good, fries were even better but the star of the meal had to be the strawberry shake. Cold, creamy and full of berry goodness... it hit the spot on a hot, Vegas afternoon. Normally I don't drink the entire thing, no matter how good, 'cause that's a lot of dairy in one sitting. This time, I absolutely drank it all. 

Fatburger would likely be in my Top 10 all-time burger experiences. It's good and a special treat since we don't have them in the Bay Area. But my heart still stays true to Krekel's Custard in Central IL."}
{"text":"- Clean restaurant on the strip in Las Vegas. Ton of foot traffic and bright lights of Las Vegas in view while you eat. Atmosphere isn't a problem, the actual food however is another thing all together. The bacon burger I had didn't have greasy goodness, the oreo shake I had lacked any real taste. In this age of \"healthy organic foods\" there's no sin in eating real food in Sin City. When you eat food that isn't great for you however and it doesn't even taste good....well that is a deadly sin!"}
{"text":"nice staff, place is clean, and burgers are good. hits the spot when you need a good fresh burger"}
{"text":"\"2 in tha mornin, got the fat burger\" ain't nothing like a juicy double king cheeseburger with a fried egg and an order of fries at 7am to soak up all that hennessy!!! Awwww it was a good day"}
{"text":"Come here once in a blue moon, decent burger & frys. Unfortunately every time I come here I order a chocolate shake, and it doesn't arrive until after my burger has been devoured.... I think your order should come out all at once shouldn't have to get your drink five minutes later after you finish your meal....I think they need help as well 2 people just don't cut it for this business...."}
{"text":"This isn't the best Fatburger in the world... I've been here a handful of times and it usually takes a bit too long to get your order. The burgers are a bit too salty for my taste too. On the other hand they have FANTASTIC real milkshakes and are open til like 3 AM. If I'm looking for a better burger I'll either grill it myself or drive down the street to Fuddruckers."}
{"text":"I love this place with my whole heart; 24 hour service and very friendly staff and bartenders... you can't lose!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Fat Burger fan.  I've never gone inside this location on sunset but I frequent it after work on the way home at night. They routinely deliver the same excellent service and food every single time I come. I love their hamburgers.  I'm not a big fan of In N Out. It may take a little longer than most people prefer as they cook it fresh, but it is worth the wait. Those burgers are juicy, flavorful and delicious. 
My only complaint is they have a dark parking lot and some lights out.  It has an unsafe feel to it.  I don't see a lot of women stopping by at night for this exact reason.  I know the neighborhood and feel safe here, so I come rain or shine."}
{"text":"Fatburger is a California chain of burgers founded in the '50s and has expanded since then to include this branch in Deerfoot Meadows. Kat and I first visited here probably close to three years ago and were pleased with a new alternative to McDonald's. The burgers here take time to make, and the servers bring the trays to your table. It is on the more expensive side, but you get a tremendous bang for your buck: the burgers are massive, with fresh buns, and a huge slab of fries on the side.

I tend to get a Kingburger because it is something I will never be: I leave the lettuce out, and get everything else (tomatoes, pickles, relish, mustard, mayo, the whole shebang!), sometimes even throwing in some mushrooms or onions for flavor. Kat never strays from her combo of ketchup, tomatoes, relish and onions. You can also substitute your fries for their freshly made onion rings, and the shakes are most likely the best burger joint shakes in the city. The vinegar and Tabasco on each table is a welcome addition. Definitely worth your money!"}
{"text":"Occasionally, I'll stop by here when I'm on my way to work.  Which I did last week.  Food is consistantly good, but on my last visit, the place was far from clean and everywhere I walked on the floor was super sticky.  Kinda makes you wonder how they keep the kitchen,..."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Vegas! 

The service was fast and everyone had a nice attitude. They ask if you want everything on the burger or anything removed. I think that is impressive since it's nothing worse than getting a burger and not liking what's on it and picking at it instead of eating it. The burger isn't just a regular patty. It's like they take a handfull of hamburger meat, season it and throw it on the grill. Got a shake with the meal and that was just as tasty! 

I am a new fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!  Nothing fancy just great tasting hamburgers. And nice people watching location."}
{"text":"Put it like this..... You come to Vegas and expect nothing but the best! 

This restaurant lives up to that! The bartender is super friendly and drinks are reasonable! By far one of the best places on the strip so far! 

If your into drinking stick to the outdoor bar!"}
{"text":"I know, I know... I'm supposed to keep my food consumption controlled if I am to either lose some of this weight or maintain.  I couldn't help but try out Fatburger again after the whole discussion between In&Out and Fatburger.  I wanted to make sure that my choice between the two were correct.  And, hands down I will choose In&Out over Fatburger.  Sorry Fatburger fans.

I chose this location just because of convenience.  What I like about Fatburger is the fact they take call ins, the patties are fatter and thicker, and the choice to have an egg in your burger is available.  Mmmm, such a delight to have egg in a burger.

Downfalls are that the meat is somewhat hard and dry, the relish on the burger doesn't do anything for my pallet, and the taste just doesn't do it for me.  There's just something missing.  I thought the onion rings were good but all that oil just lost me.  

Staff were great and awesome.  Lady calling out names when the order is up seems cheerful and willing to go above and beyond.  I liked her enthusiasm.  :D"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon right in front of the cashier. Once it got confirmed he tells us that they don't take groupons at this location. Really? couldn't tell us that before we bought the Groupon. 1 star review for an incompetent employee."}
{"text":"So sorry so many people have had such a bad experience here - we had a good meal.
An excellent inexpensive alternative while at the Red Rock Resort.
We split a medium cheeseburger meal - enough for two - and we loved the variety of toppings.
Hope others will have as good a meal as we did!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my guilty pleasure burger spot, as it is not healthy in any way. They do have the best vegan BOCA burger in Vegas. A few other spots have the BOCA patty but all the other elements that make their burgers come no where close to taste and portions like Fat Burger does. They also offer a GARDEN patty but something about the hearty taste of the BOCA wins. They use a 5oz patty instead of the 3oz like the other places use, it's meatier and filling. A giant plus. 

Their combination of mustard, lettuce, tomato, pickles, relish & onion are simple and delicious. I order mine with extra pickles and both raw and grilled onions with no mayo, so satisfying. Order with fat fries and you won't regret it.

One complaint, get a gluten free bun that doesn't have egg in it!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home, as they cook their burger til it burnt crisp,  no juicy burgers  and I forgot while I waited in line they kill the meat, til it has no pink - no more hamburgers, yuck. 
It just taste like burnt crispy salted jerky.
It's just convenient,  because it's here in the casino."}
{"text":"I would rate this place 2.5 stars. food was delish, but service sucks balls. 

We went here for dinner on Friday night, a quick stop for \"fast food\" on the way to the airport.  Is Fat Burger fast food? because this place was anything but fast!

There were 4 people working, 1 cashier and 3 ppl prepping food. It took 15-20 minutes for our order (2 burgers, shake, drink, fat fries) to come out.  The server brought us our food and I asked \"will my shake be coming out?\" and the chick gave me a blank stare and walked away muttering \"I don't even know what's going on.\"  Really?!  Did I just witness that?  My shake came out...5 minutes later.  My burger with cheese and chopped up bacon was bomb-tastic btw. So freakin good.  Too bad the service here sucks though."}
{"text":"Fat-burger is the best burger you can ever taste in your whole life. I say that because its so dam true . once you try the xxxx burger it will literally put you on your back . the meat is thick with very nice and tasty flavors and once you take a big bite of the burger you can taste the freshness of the bun, to the lettuce to the tomatoes and onions and the melted cheese . don't forget about the speechless chill cheese fries  and the great one and only milkshake is to die for. if you never been to fat burgers your missing out so much. Its truly a must to go their . you truly need to go if your a big time hamburger eater . its truly a big time must for-real. Don't miss out on the greatest hamburger you'll ever eat in your entire life."}
{"text":"No thanks this restaurant is very overrated & overpriced i was a big fan , In & Out will always be better"}
{"text":"Totally unimpressed. They didn't even make the burger as I ordered it. I was the only person in line, and they rushed me to take my order. Then got it wrong. Way over-priced."}
{"text":"This was my first time going and it was awful service and negative energy. There was one other family there with little kids as well for my self I have a child and the blond girl cursed more times then I can count and was screaming at one of the gentalmen there. I assume she was the manager from her counting the money. I will never be attending this place again or will I suggest it."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly. But this location needs a deep cleaning. It is very dirty with dirty bathrooms. Cleanliness is not a priority for this location"}
{"text":"Sure this review is from a very blurry 2:00 a.m. need of food on the strip. But come to think of it that is most my reviews from Vegas. I have come here everytime I go to Vegas. I have never had a bad burger or fries. Yes It's a little more pricey then typical chain burger joints. But when in need a food 24 hour Fat Burger is worth it. I loved the add of the outdoor seating area/bar. I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"I have been a Fatburger fan for years, but this is only the second time I have visited this particular location.  The quality of the hamburger was excellent, however the fries were barely warm and when I asked for a replacement the server just dropped the tray on the table, turned and walked away.  There are lot of establishments out there that offer much better service.  I won't stop eating at Fatburger, just not this one.  A sister location at the Fiesta Hotel Casino has a friendly staff with the same food.  Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Fat Burger has been a mainstay to our family since we moved to the Las Vegas valley more than 20 years ago.  Their quality has been pretty good across the various locations.  Food is great but sometimes the service...not so much.

There is a restaurant inside Fiesta Hotel and Casino that sets a new standard for service, regardless the fare. The Fat Burger there, who's assistant manager is Robert, sets a new standard.  The food quality is superb.  Hot and fresh fries, burgers, and very tasty shakes.  He stopped by our table twice and cleaned our area before we could do it ourselves.

I highly recommend this place for food AND a lesson in customer service!"}
{"text":"Used to frequent this location at least once per week or more. Service was friendly and the place was clean and well kept. Stopping in tonight on a whim has cured me of going back. Slow counter/order service, very slow in delivery orderd at 5:09 and received at 5:34 and I know it is fresh but when drive in always take precedent dine in customers suffer. Delivered order to table was wrong and condiment bar was under filled and the large ketchup dispenser empty until I brought it to their attention.
The last issue is what happened to the Fatburger theme of Rock and Roll and light hearted upbeat music. I am not a fan of Rap and Hip Hop and listening to this music just ruined the whole visit. Might as well remove the Icon pictures off the wall and replace them with BIG, Tupac, Snoop and all the other gangsters of music. I can go to Five Guys and a host of other places where we are not ignored and the service is faster with a smile and helpful attitude."}
{"text":"OK, I am writing this review out of spite.  That's right, you heard me!  I am writing this review to merely point out how much better this place is than the new competition across the street, Five Guys!  

I have been eating here consistently since it opened, and it does not disappoint.  The restaurant is very clean, bathrooms included.  There is a fun \"Hard Rock Cafe\"-lite ambiance, that is just good fun.  Burgers are very precisely and neatly made, and there is always a good \"special burger\" on offer.  The seating at the tables is comfortable, well-spaced, and interesting, and there is a summer patio.  The facility is licensed, so you can also get a brew with your burger, draft as well.  Even their fries are great.  I won't deny that it is slightly on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Alright I'm going to make a bold statement here - as far as just FOOD is concerned, Fatburger is superior to In n Out.The burgers are tasty and SO FRESH. They don't taste like fast food burgers at all. The fries are great, and OMG avoid the milkshakes - they are insanely delicious and addicting (a bad habit to start I tell you!).

However , these tasty made to order burgers come with quite a few pitfalls. This place take an insanely long time (think 10+ minutes for \"fast food\")! They do have an online ordering system but who the hell thinks to do that? 

Additionally they are really pricey for what you get (over double the cost of In n out). Lastly, I hate the sizes of the burgers. In n Out serves the perfect burger size (at least for me!). At Fatburger I can either eat a tiny 2.5 oz burger or jump up to like 5.5 oz. Where's my reasonable 3-4.5 oz burger options people??! It's cool you offer many sizes, but not cool that none of them are a 'Normal' sized burger ! 

Overall if I was in GVR (which I am quite often), this is a great option. In general when I'm out and about I reach for In n Out as it's cheaper, faster, and the portion size is better."}
{"text":"A tad scary... (yes, I've seen women of the night at this establishment), and pretty expensive for burgers... but this place is a solid greasy option for your late night burger fix on the strip. I'm always glad these guys are around when I bust out of the poker table or craps game at 3 AM and want something yummy to eat."}
{"text":"Fat burger is definitely up there when it comes to burgers. They are juicy, fresh and hearty! I go through so many phases when it comes to burgers and lately I've noticed that it usually takes some convincing for me to want to eat one. Other times, I crave them and when I crave them, its bad. This burger hit the spot although I wish the bacon as a little crispier. Mind you, I probably could have requested that. Haha. Any who, I'll be back and I recommend the old fashioned bacon cheddar!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Fatburger..but this location was disapointing ,  they got our orders wrong, burgers were dry and overcooked . The sizes of the burgers are smaller than other fat burgers I've been to."}
{"text":"I'm still disappointed in this server. My friend ordered us some burgers and mine is always a cheese burger with mustard only. He came back to the table and we chit chatted for a bit and I looked at the receipt and it said a cheese burger with everything but mustard. I told my friend and he went back up to catch them before they made the burger and right away before he opened his mouth she said \"We are already cooking the burgers so you can't change your order\", he said ok I was just wanting to tell you that the burger is suppose to be a cheeseburger with mustard only and it's wrong on the ticket. This server had the nerve to tell him that he was lying and didn't tell her that. 

Wow I couldn't believe it when he told me. If it were me she wouldn't have said it again that is for sure. What in the world has happened to customer care and satisfaction? It was such a simple thing that all she had to say was I'm sorry for the mix up and it will be no problem. I really don't think she should be waiting on customers.

Rudeness is not tolerated by this customer and they have lost 2 good customers.

PS: I have her name but I don't think I need to mention that as I'm sure anyone that frequents there knows who I am talking about."}
{"text":"The burger was excellent, their fries and onions rings are just as excellent and their piña colada and strawberry drink was beyond great!!! Big thanks to the fellow who helped us! He made us feel very welcomed!"}
{"text":"went to fatburger a few weeks ago.
love the food here. they have beer as well. burgers are very tasty and the price is very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Damn! That burger was good! Seasoned to perfection to. Quick and easy order, and they will bring you the food. I was full but I kept eating til it was gone. The price was about $7.50 for my burger not sure how much my lemonade was."}
{"text":"Called them to see if they were open and the guy said yes. I said great I will call you back with an order to go. Called back 3 minutes later and went to voicemail. Waited a few more minutes and called again still went to voicemail. So I called from my husband's phone and wouldn't you know, they answered. I said I was calling to place an order and the guy straight up hung up on me. Can't tell you how much I love Fatburger, but this definitely pissed me off. Definitely not going back. Called 5 guys across the street, 10 minutes before closing and they happily took my order and had a smile on their faces. Love spending my money on places that deserve it! Bye bye Fatburger."}
{"text":"I came here (fully sober) mid day on a Friday. The place wasn't overly packed but still a good amount of people were there. I've never had a Fatburger mostly because all of the ones I know of in the Midwest closed. 

We split a L burger and fat fries. The fat fries are what most places call \"steak fries\" they were really good and freshly made. We ordered the burger the way they normally make it and add cheese. The burger was decent but nothing life changing. It was heavy on the mustard also. 

It took 20 minutes to get our food, which was longer than I expected but it wasn't that big of a deal. 

I've heard this place is great when you're drunk so maybe I came at the wrong time"}
{"text":"Perhaps the people at the drive-thru window are not the most engaging at this Fatburger location. Who cares? All their energy and efforts go into making a flavorful, juicy, fat burger. The fat content in this burger is superb -although I don't know the actual percentage of fat. Just know that the burger juice will run down your arm. 

The burgers are dressed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions (ask for grilled), pickles, relish, and mustard. For an additional cost, you can add-on eggs, cheese, bacon, onion rings, or chili. While most fast-food establishments only offer beef burgers, Fatburger has always had turkey burgers on the menu too. They've even included vegetarian patties and glutten-free buns.

The burger sizes range from small to XXXL. For some reason, the small fat is no longer on the drive-thru menu - but it's still available. 

The sides range from onion rings to skinny fries to fat fries and even chili cheese fries. I personally think it's silly for anyone to come to FATburger and get SKINNY fries. My go-to are the fat fries or the onion rings. There's also hand-scooped shakes, but they are not my favorites. Plus, the burger and fries alone will keep you pretty satisfied.

Note: If there is no one else ahead of you, then it will take them approximately 10 minutes to prepare your order."}
{"text":"First and last time I'll eat at fat burger! Came out of the movie Theater and ordered two cheese burgers order of fat fries and a soda $19. Dollars. The burger was dry and tasteless, fries were tasty! After we got home felt sick and lots of indigestion! Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I'm an East Coaster and don't understand or care for In n Out.  I do however enjoy Fatburger.  I can choose my size and customize- I'm all about that option.  My staple, medium, sautéed onions, mushrooms, Swiss and NO mustard and NO mayo here- ketchup only please!  Their shakes are always undeniably tasty! I go for the lasted limited edition shake;). The staff here is always friendly and all have a smile on their faces and make sure you enjoy what you ordered!  
Please tip them and wait, wait and listen;)"}
{"text":"Wwwooowiee! So colorful inside! So much going on on the menu. Where to look first?! Fatburger gives off a jolly vibe - maybe because of all the signs and colors everywhere. And the fact that you can smell the aroma of fat juicy burgers. 

The bf's original burger tasted bland and dry. I added mushroom to mine and it gave the burger a good amount of juuuice and flavor. I then regret ordering just a original burger. Perhaps we should've ordered something with lots of toppings and add ons. Oh well! The fries were average. Not as good as other places that's for sure. Next time, I'm going for the onion rings or chili cheese fries.

Be sure to add toppings or you'll end up with a dry burger! I'll be back for more someday!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon for 2 cheeseburger combos. Asked to sub one with turkey patty as I don't eat beef. While the beef and turkey burgers are the same price on the menu, we would have been willing to pay a bit of an up charge if necessary. The worker had to call someone who said no. Bad mistake. We left and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"After a night of singing and dancing at New York New York's piano bar, FATBURGER was our next stop. 24 hours of awesome burger deliciousness!!!

Very busy even at 3am... and after the food it was understandable. It might have been all the rum, but the wait seemed to take 20 mins. It was definitely worthwhile. I love to eat. And I love to eat burgers. But man, this one took all my effort. 

Be careful, they only take cash!"}
{"text":"I went with the XXXL after a full day of walking Vegas. I finished the whole thing easily since I was so hungry. I didn't try anything else for the XXXL is pretty darn big. Plenty. 

Service was great by Deebo who was tending the outside bar. The patio is heated with TVs right there  along the strip. 

The burger was good. It hit the spot after miles of walking. Nice atmosphere but Vegas prices for a big burger. After tip, the bill was around $22 for just myself."}
{"text":"Came here late night, and had a burger, skinny fries, and onion rings. All three was subpar to me, very average, and nothing special. They do have a nice outside bar (which includes selling the 100 oz frozen drinks) and yeah thats pretty much it ( and they do also offer veggie and turkey burgers)."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time and loved the atmosphere and service. Figured I would give an old star another go...I was not dissatisfied"}
{"text":"I usually don't leave such negative reviews, but this place SUCKS!!! They close early, have NO interest in customer service, are WAY overpriced and are just an overall underwhelming & negative experience... I'll never return here again... In & Out Burgers are less expensive, faster & tastier... How does this Fatburger stay in business?!?"}
{"text":"My friend Bill and I went to #Fatburger for lunch today at Bankers Hall. Had a 1/4 lb Angus burger, lg fries and unlimited pop for $12.98 The fries were so big that we split one order. I had originally thought that this was a sit in restaurant but instead was a food court kiosk. I'll definitely be going back sometime or another."}
{"text":"I went to Las Vegas for the first time in June, it was also my first trip to Fatburger. I cam here a couple weeks after Mayweather had his infamous melee here. Anyhow, back to the food. I came here twice during my stay and it was excellent. I went with the cheeseburger and fries. They allow you to choose the size of your burger and fries, which I liked. The burger was well seasoned and the prices are reasonable. I will definitely eat at this place when I visit Vegas again!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a thick juicy greasy burger where you don't have to sit inside the restaurant.  Fat burger is your place.  It's always scary bc it's always empty inside but fat burger delivers on big burgers. The 1lb burger is the size of my head.  But he prepared to wait for your food bc ours always takes a good 15-20 min in the drive thru no less.  But they always get our order correct so that's a plus"}
{"text":"Usually we really enjoy eating at Fatburger.  The last two visits have left us disappointed....The place is not crowded and yet our food comes out warm.  No excuse when ours is the only order being made.  Tonight not only were the burgers just warm, they were extremely salty and even the fries were not the usual piping hot.  Not sure why the quality is going down, but we will be trying other burger places for a while."}
{"text":"LATE NITE SNACK! 
For a light night snack we turned up in the Texas it was after 12 and we just finished bowling! We were starving and guess who saved the day FAT BURGA! 
My wife got the XXL With egg, bacon and cheese and I got the XXL burger with just cheese ketchup and mustard . Also we ordered chillie cheese fries that were amazing! No complaints... this was a classic late nite stop and I was ultimately satisfied with the service."}
{"text":"We got into a taxi before 4 am and asked to take us somewhere that was open for food. Our taxi driver was pretty useless. I know there was a Fatburger across from our hotel (Aria) so directed idiot driver there. 

There was no line and we placed our orders. A medium burger for me and I splurged on onion rings. Our food was cooked in a reasonable amount of time. Our to go bags were filled with napkins and ketchup.

my burger was very good and I LOVED all the toppings. I was skeptical of yellow onion rings as I'mused to closer to orange form heavy batter and deep frying. Lightly battered and good.

And this place is 24 hours. And the employee danced for us while handing us our food. Service and entertainment!

PS: Get the coupon for $5 off a huge slushie. And Sundays / Mondays during football, supposedly $22 unlimited beer and a basket of wings."}
{"text":"very bland in my opinion, It's a skip just a heads up"}
{"text":"We happened to notice Fatburger when going down the Vegas strip.  There aren't any near where I live so I was happy to give it a try. I was happy I did. I had a KingBurger with everything on it and a side of homemade onion rings. The burger was awesome. Big...Juicy...Messy....Perfect!!!  The onion rings were great too."}
{"text":"My complaint is not about the food. It's generally ok. My complaint is when you through drive thru your forced to go inside to figure the prices. I brought this to the attention of management some weeks ago. It apparently fell on deaf ears. I'm not surprised."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it is about FatBurger that's caused it to fall out of my good graces so, but here we are at two lowly stars. Maybe it's because my first FB experience was at the Las Vegas Strip FatBurger, at three in the morning, surrounded by hookers, pimps, punters, johns, pushers, bookies, trannies, and all remaining manner of late-night underbelly. It added charm, whimsy, and terrifying people watching.

Since then, every time I've been progressively more disappointed. We've reached the nadir here, with burgers that lack any real flavor to me, unless I punch them up with the tasty cholesterol of a fried egg on them. I don't know what they're NOT doing, but when Smashburger just down the street is creating a burger of kings, jam-packed with SMASH flavor, I can't help but be disappointed at the lifeless patty of beef crying out for a savior of spice. Alas, none to be found, it forces its way down my gullet, falling into a heap of shame and indigestion.

The fries are, well, they're run-of-the-mill frozen steak fries.

I suppose for someone that bills themselves as the last great hamburger stand, I really wish they'd focus on, you know, making great hamburgers. For now, I'll swing down to Smashburger or, in a pinch, shame-eat at Five Guys."}
{"text":"We stopped by here after going to the after hours club, Empire. It was around 4:00am-5:00am, we were drunk and hungry so we ate here. Like what everyone else said, is this place ever clean? My friends and I came back here three times during the week (usually in the late night, early morning) and it was always dirty. They have tons of ingredients on the burger: mustard, relish, onions, pickles, tomato, lettuce, mayo, and cheese, bacon, egg, chili (which cost extra). Ate at this place in Vegas and SoCal and came to realize, I'm not a huge fan of it and only eat it due to its convenience and because we didn't know where else to eat in Vegas during that time. Onion rings and steak fries were mediocre. Could barely finish a king burger to myself, fat burger was pretty easy to kill by myself. Also, at the bottom of your receipt, they usually offer free onion rings for your next burger purchase...keep in mind, the onion rings aren't that great."}
{"text":"Don't try to order late night because that crew is lazy and will not take your order. They say they are open until 1am, she said no 12, we gotta clean and we will be her till 1 but you cant get no food.They were rude and unprofessional. This is the second time this happened, first time to complain. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Haven't has a fat burger is over a decade so I needed something fast so I decided to get a burger. I settled on fat burger and ordered a 1/2 Patty burger and fat fries combo. The burger was juicy and quite large to my surprise. The drinks are help yourself with unlimited refills. The burger, fries and drink combo came out be like $14 a decent price for the quality and quantity. I was definitely full after eating the 1/2 pound burger. They also grill the buns which is a nice touch.

It does take a bit to get your order once you place it. This isn't a bad thing since you know your getting a freshly cooked burger."}
{"text":"Right across the street from work, so when I'm in need of some juicy meat, I go here. I think it's a little pricey but if you want a burger and not go to a sit down restaurant, this will do. The few times I've gone the food has been tasty and fresh. Yes, I will go back!"}
{"text":"Another one of my go to fast food restaurants in Las Vegas. I haven't been to this location for years but it was delicious, especially after a night of booze. Fat burger with cheese and fries, we skipped the shake this time but they are yummy. Staff was friendly. Prices of course are higher since it's on The Strip. Bathroom was surprisingly clean for a Friday night. (lol)."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. I've never had a problem with Fatburger or this location. The burgers are always good, yes you may wait a few minutes longer than other fast food places but they make everything fresh to order. I don't eat fast food burgers very often but this Fatburger is one of the places I will go when I hanker for a cheeseburger and I'm close by. (The only other fast food burgers I eat are In n Out and Smashburger)"}
{"text":"Now THIS is a burger! The turkey burger with cheese on a gluten free bun...sheer happiness!! Please come to Dallas. They pile on the lettuce, tomatoes & etc as well. & mmm pickles! Great patio & bar area too. Keep it on your list of spots to hit up while in Vegas."}
{"text":"While in Vegas, I ate Fatburger 4 times.....my heart still hurts. Looking back on it, it was totally worth it. The only thing I can say is that the burgers are freaking slamming, especially after having some beer flavored drinks. 

The burgers range all the way from medium to XXXL and I went with a medium every single time (make fun of me if you want). If you are feeling tough, go ahead and get the XXXL. My buddy did it and almost died on the spot from cholesterol overload...but he did say it was freaking awesome. Overall it's a slam dunk for fast food and maybe the sloppiest/greatest burger I've had....while in Vegas. BOoM!"}
{"text":"wasn't a fan. the food was typical fast food. it look quite a while for someone to take care of us. which, i don't blame the waitress, she was obviously quite busy, but they should put more people on the floor at once. the drinks were also overpriced."}
{"text":"They don't close at 12pm they close whenever they feel like it past 11. Don't come here if you're looking for anything past that time or someone will come out and tell you they're closed."}
{"text":"Here's something I never expected to say since becoming a vegetarian: I can't get enough of Fatburger. My boyfriend, who is also a veghead, and I actively avoided this place until we found out last week that it serves a veggie burger. So, we put aside our judgment  and decided to try out the joint. And I'm so, so glad we did. 

The veggie burger is made with a premium Boca patty that is thick, juicy and flavorful. Fatburger also features a variety of toppings and customizing items is pretty easy. This is important because I don't like when restaurants have rigid topping standards for their sandwiches (I'm looking at you, Burger King).

I suppose my only complaints are the long wait time and high prices for what I consider a fast food joint. But the food is notches above your typical drive-thru eatery, and the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"The burgers here never disappoint. I have eaten here several times and while some may find it to be pricey for a burger joint, I firmly believe that you get what you pay for in an eating establishment. You want a .99 cheeseburger you get what you get it's all I'm saying. The service is great and the food is fantastic. My only gripe would be, and this is very minor, that the upholstery on some of the seating is starting to show its age."}
{"text":"I have kids that bowl at Santa Fe Station in the Saturday morning leagues, and this place (aside from Starbucks) is the only fast food joint open for breakfast inside the casino. I'll admit it is a bit pricey for a breakfast sandwich (they charge .99 extra for cheese). We usually get the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and a drink, for 3 of us and it costs right around $20. If I would get my lazy butt out of bed earlier I would definitely go through a much less expensive Burger King or McDonald's drive thru, but when you're stuck for 3 hours in the morning at Santa Fe this option isn't bad. The sandwiches are actually quite tasty. The ladies that work there are always very courteous and quickly get to work on my order. My reason for taking 2 stars is the price and lack of variety."}
{"text":"We eat here for lunch whenever we visit. Great spot at the edge of the street to people watch and plenty of TVs to catch your favorite game.  Only thing that would make this place better is having different meat options for their burgers. A restaurant with \"burger\" in its name should have healthy (lean) ground beef options. After all, this isn't a fast food stop."}
{"text":"Three of us went in for lunch and waited more than thirty minutes before we asked for our money back and left. The manager was so disorganized it took nearly ten more minutes to get our money back. 

The kitchen was fighting audibly. They were not busy enough to merit this level of horrible service. 

If I could give an even worse review I would."}
{"text":"I visit this location at least once every couple weeks. I have never had a bad experience here with the food or the service. They so sometimes seem like they are short staffed and the wait is a bit long on those days. I however dont mind the wait because the food is great."}
{"text":"Great late night food and great bar to keep on partying, fries are good.  Can't beat being right off the strip especially when everything else is closed."}
{"text":"Today was my daughter-in-law's birthday. She is from California where Fatburger originated so we thought we'd give it a try after all the positive reviews.
What a disappointment! Firstly,walking in,although it was a Monday at 4pm,there were no people inside which was surprising. The restaurant itself is like a\" hole in the wall.\" There is no atmosphere at all. I'd rather eat at Wendy's or McDonald's.
There is one table at the back and a few at the front.Then there is a long narrow hallway with single counter type chairs  where you face the wall if you eat alone,very unappealing.
The table area where we sat at the front was so cold. I asked the server if she could put up the heat a bit but she said it was as high as it could go.Also,she said the cold is from the type of building it is.Huh?
The food itself is average.The hamburgers are pretty average,and my relative said that most of the lettuce in her bun was brown & soggy and removed it.The fries were frozen, and what you would find at any fast food place, nothing special. There is no comparison to Fatburger in the U.S.
The prices are absolutely exorbitant for what you get! We were four people;one baby burger for $5.99 no fries/drink included, two combos for $11.49 each,and one original burger for $6.99 with fries/drink extra. Tax on all these burgers was extra. To top all this off,the pop machine didn't work so we couldn't have soda. Instead we were given water bottles. We should have been given free water bottles and have the soft drink prices credited.What decent restaurant doesn't check to see if their equipment is working properly. And where is the customer service? No soda to be had with our meal?
After we received the bill of close to $50,I felt we were all \"taken\" for a ride. To spend this amount of hard earned money by pretending this restaurant is so gourmet/special when all it really is,is fast food,is ludicrous to me.
Your food is served  on a small black plastic throw away container.
If you want a pleasant dining experience even in a fast food place, with value for your dollar,you're better off going to Timmy's,Wendy's or even McDonald's.If you want an average hamburger, not great atmosphere,where everything is a la cart and a very overpriced meal, then try Fatburger. I,nor my family will be back there very soon."}
{"text":"Disgusting, and miserable. The first two things that come to mind. Girl Stromee rolled her eyes when she had to stop to help us. Another girl who walked in whose shift was just started had two cigarettes hanging out of her mouth when she walked passed. She went past the grill and to the back. Just filthy. I can definitely tell we aren't in California anymore..."}
{"text":"Was getting my car washed next door and realized it was gonna be a while so i walked to Fatburger. I had never had it before so i figured I'd give it a shot.  There were three people in front of me making some sort of group order. They ordered everything and then when they were told the total, they started arguing with the poor cashier about the prices as if he makes them. They even talked about letting me go before them but then they continued to complain about the orders price total. I will admit that Fatburgers prices were VERY HIGH but i ended up walking back to the car wash because it was taking so long, oh yea and also the fact that the second i walked inside the place it smelled like something was rotting or molded or something gross. Gonna get chick fila instead."}
{"text":"We went here late at night because most of the food inside the food court at the MGM was closed. It was a short walk from the MGM. Outside the have a Fat Bar. We went inside and there was no wait. This Fatburger doesn't have kids meals. We ordered the smallest burgers, fat fries, and skinny fries. We also got root beer floats. They give you a cup with ice cream and you can put any kind of soda into it. My kids were happy. You can also get refills on the soda part of the float. Our burgers seemed small and less tasty than most Fatburgers and the bun wasn't super fresh. They also don't have stamp cards but were willing to stamp mine that I had."}
{"text":"OMG...YUM...DELICIOUS... I must say, much better then Five Guys and In and Out (sorry guys)... Just yummy... although the fries with chili and cheese left me sad.. The chili wasn't that great.. otherwise Yum"}
{"text":"Worst Fatbutger location ever, Love the Burger though. 
1- They can't hear the order properly at the drive thru window.
2- Rude and to the point greeting and no smile.
3- Didn't label the burger (had regular, veggie and turkey)"}
{"text":"ALWAYS  takes a long time. It seems they're understaffed. Food was and is always decent but there was a hair in my fries. Science shows staph bacteria can be found in hair. And that just went into my mouth. Thankfully they gave me a new fry"}
{"text":"The Fatburger is one of the best burgers in town, and the best fries ever! They also have super quick service so you have your food in no time. You can't go wrong with a Fat deal! It's a heart attac waiting to happen, but oh so good!"}
{"text":"This is another vegas guilty pleasure of mine (and it's a wonder why my swimsuit never fits the same at Rehab on sunday!)  

Steak fries.. yummy.  Burger.. really yummy. I'm not a huge milkshake fan, so I washed it all down with a diet coke (cause you know, gotta keep it 'light')

I like mine with mustard, and pickles, lots and lots and lots and lots of pickles, but have tried it with chili too(also delish) of course with a side of pickles, and a little mustard.  :0)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The burgers are delicious and really good! In the past year I visited Las Vegas and also visited Fatburger. I was completely in love"}
{"text":"Very good food and service the people were very nice but when I looked down I saw the floor.was dirty  but I will be back you you"}
{"text":"WOW! Question - how much would you expect to pay for a 1/3lb single burger with cheese, fries and coke? $6-8?? I just paid $13.58 through this Fat Burger's drive-thru! Ridiculous! I should have just kept on going and gone somewhere else. I even questioned the drive-thru attendant thinking maybe he didn't ring up the meal correctly. Nope, he said it's correct because I \"ordered a meal.\" When I ordered, the drive-thru sign did not have the meal combo prices posted and some of the pricing looked covered up and hand written - which was all faded - but SERIOUSLY, almost $14 for one little burger meal! Twice the price of other fast food burger joints (Carls Jr. and In-and-Out) and not any tastier or better quality! Even Red Robin down the street has $6.99 double burgers with unlimited? fries! I was hungry, I paid, I ate and now I'm gonna complain... Never again! Be ware of this place and their crazy prices!!"}
{"text":"We were going to Shake Shack a lot for lunch so we decided to shake it up and head on over here instead. I'm glad we did! They also have Gluten Free options!!!!

The atmosphere/vibe/decor: We sat outside, it was really nice and fun to watch all the people walking the strip. It was clean, casual, and I liked that we were shaded by an umbrella because that sun can get hot!

The Food: I was really surprised to see that they had Gluten Free buns! That was awesome, and they were delicious so that's always a plus. Their burgers range from normal to gigantic size and it's all really delicious and tastes fresh. The French fries were crispy and the beer was cold and delicious!

The Service: The girl serving us was really friendly and personable, she answered all of our questions and was very accommodating which we appreciated. Though, at the end of our meal as we were paying the bill, it was about $43 and we paid with a $50... she grabbed the bill & said, \"I'll be right back with your change\" and we waited for 12 minutes as we finished our drinks then waited another 5 minutes. She never came back and avoided us at all costs until we finally gave up and started to leave. She waved at us and said, \"thanks guys! Have a good one!\" Of course we were going to tip her, but the fact that she just took the money and never came back is really, wrong. That was really sort of frustrating.

Overall: the food was great, the service was good but sort of an odd experience. Next time, I'll pay with my card I guess..."}
{"text":"Not my favorite burger joint but they are open 24 hours if you are nearby and having a burger fix. Location is not the nicest as others have stated."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! brought the burger no fries...didn't care. Sent back the entire meal and no manager. waiter didnt even offer to bring me a new meal. Will go to McDonalds or In n Out next time."}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from the Monte Carlo.  

Pretty decent burger.  The have 4 sizes to choose from and four add-ins (cheese, bacon, chili, and an egge). I opted for everything but the chili and I was quite happy.  This burger is a step up from In-N-Out but still not as good as a Royal Robin Burger.  

The fries come in two cuts skinny or steak fries.  Nothing too special here. The onion rings were ok.  

The Maui-banana shake is very good.

3.5 stars

In n out being 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped at the drive-thru about 4:00pm, Friday, March 10, 2017 and ordered two medium burgers, one with cheese and no onions and a side of curly fries.  I thought that $5.09 was an excessive charge for a hamburger, but, I heard they were good, so thought that I would give it a try.   The woman with a strong accent (possibly hispanic) at the loud-speaker took our order and told me that the total was \"$20.00\".  I said \"that's not correct, two hambergers total $10.18 an none order of fries is just over three dollars.\"  She said \"cheese for one hamburger\".  I asked if one slice of cheese was $5.00 and she told me that it was.  
WHAT A RIP OFF.
We left and went elsewhere.  Will never go there!"}
{"text":"So as a kid I came here with my friend, and we watched in horror as her patty was accidentally flopped on the counter. Only just a bit. At least according to the guy who put it right back onto the grill. Maybe he thought we didn't see. Maybe he thought ten year olds wouldn't care. But my friends' mom sure did, and demanded another patty be made. 
I didn't go back for many years, until after high school, when I decided to try their veggie burger. Which turned out to be nothing but a Boca burger. For basically the same price as a regular one. It is fine that they offer it at all, but do not kid yourself into thinking that makes it ok to act like it is takes just as much time and effort as the meat patties, and therefore should be priced like them. Five dollars. Five dollars. Really?"}
{"text":"Nothing special. The beef is packed on just like a fat patty should be. I think, I enjoyed the skinny ass chili cheese fries a lot more.  

First time for everything!"}
{"text":"after several fatburgers i feel it is still to come clean and admit i have become a really big fan. i have never had a bad burger. This is my favorite and only place that i do eat a burger at. 

i was a hater at first yes. But Fatburger worked its way into my heart and i admit they know how to make a delicious f-ing burger here!!


Consistency in their food is solid here, and nothing better than being able to count on a place where you will always get a good meal...over and over again.

Kudos Fatburger"}
{"text":"I've tried this Fatburger location twice now. Both times just a 3 star. While they do have HUGH burgers, they also have little burgers for the kids & the lil eaters. Burgers have all sorts of items you can put on. I have felt both time that their burgers are a little bland and very greasy, and their chili cheese fries are about par. 24 hr DT."}
{"text":"Very friendly, good service. The food was excellent and will be going back. Great selection of burgers and made the way you want it."}
{"text":"It's about 3 a.m.-- you and your party is super-drunk from a night at Pure at Caesar's Palace-- where do you go? FATTBURGER- the last great hamburger stand! For me, all it takes is a turkey burger with the works, fries, and a chocolate milkshake to revive the evening's memories. Open 24 Hours. Thank you Vegas."}
{"text":"I like Fatburger, usually. I walked down the strip and was accosted by people handing out cards - buy one drink, get one free. Sounds good, right? 

I go inside to order my burger, and try to order my drafts (the tap is right next to the cash register). She tells me I have to go outside to the bar to order the drinks. Whatever. So I go outside. I try and order two shock tops. No deal. She says the second draft has to be a domestic. I remind her it's made in America. Still no deal. I look at the card and it says nothing about this. So, I'm forced to order a bud light to comply with their unwritten policy. 

I like the food, but hate having to jump through hoops just to claim an offer they're handing out. Fix the service, and I'm happy."}
{"text":"Love coming here for the veggie burger on my lunch break. Larger than your typical veggie burger, so it works out great on those days I have a huge appetite. I am also a big fan of their fries, skinny style or fat style!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the mom to grab a quick dinner. The place was a ghost town. Not complaining. It was a Sunday and it meant quick and speedy service. I think we all know how long you can wait for a Fatburger to be cooked when the place is packed!

Anyway, I got the veggie burger and mom got the regular. Both were pretty good and the fries were awesome! Best fries I've had from a fast food chain to date. I say this because it had been YEARS since I've eaten at Fatburger, let alone ordered their fries because the burger always seemed to be enough. I was starving this day! lol!

Staff was very friendly and the cashier working that day was pretty darn cute, I might add. ;)

I recommend. Yup....sure do!"}
{"text":"So I'm at a beer festival and someone walks by with a bag of Fatburger and the smell just makes me want some. So my buddies and I head over to get some grub. It's clean and not too expensive. They are the place if you want a big burger. I was hungry so I got the size large with skinny fries and a chocolate shake. The large has to be around 8oz so that's a decent size for a burger when your hungry. My friend got herself the medium. The burger was nice and juicy and they make to order so everything was hot. I like that I can choose whats on the burger. The shake is so good but after the burger and fries it was hard to finish ha ha. Nothing to special about the fries. They weren't bad or have an amazing twist on them so if you like potatoes you will like them.

Fatburger gets 3 stars not only for living up to their name for fat burgers but also because they have good food and good service!"}
{"text":"I felt sorry for my heart as I was eating this ball of grease, but fast food is fast food and sometimes you just want a disgusting burger because you're too lazy to make something good at home."}
{"text":"Food was good, somewhat small for the price. Customer service was terrible, the guy in front didn't show any kind of smile or sympathy I heard one girl call him Jorge so I'm sure that's his name. He should really work on how he speaks to customers."}
{"text":"I Love My FOOD everytime here but I work in the same shopping center so I order from them alot and they literally answer the phone maybe 10 % of the time we call to order for pick up everytime!
they are loosing sooooooo much business by not picking up the phone!!! Id be sooooo mad if i owned this location and my employees never pick up the phone!!!

They hear the phone and its never that busy but they never wanna pick it up for some reason even tho alot of people like to call ahead because this is not a fast food joint a good burger takes time!

Cant even imagine how much MONEY this location looses!!!

PHONE CUSTOMER IS THE SAME AS A WALK IN CUSTOMER
 and they both have green money lol smh"}
{"text":"I'm a local and outside of the Fatburger in the Red Rock, this is the closes option. Every time I come here (which isn't often) I'm so disappointed and today I decided to write a review. The cashier was super rude, I paid 18.00 for 2 burgers and fries for my daughter and myself and the lettuce looked days old and my French fries were ice cold. There was no ice in the ice machine and it didn't smell too pleasant. One of the workers tossed his empty juice bottle across the room (I guess trying to make it in the trash) and it fell in the area where the veggies are. (Poor decision on his behalf) needless to say I will not be coming back to this location because even though it was only $18.00, when I spend money I expect better than this. This location gives Fatburger a bad rep."}
{"text":"Im sure you guys would love the food here ...anyways i order my food here but I didnt get the exact food that I order but its all fine with me cus they alredy refund me bak so I trust em n I wl never stop ordering from here.....you guys should too...."}
{"text":"The burger was absolutely delicious and just what we wanted after partying all night on the strip. I had a medium size burger with Bacon and an egg and my forbids thought I was in heaven. The deliciousness may have been a result of our slight intoxication, but regardless the burger hit the spot. The servers were really friendly too. At one point a worker came over and put our trash away for us. 

My only gripe is that you have to pay a dollar for cheese. Cmon, cheese is a given nowadays. Oh, and we thought it was closed for a sec, the Windows are extremely.dark."}
{"text":"This Fatburger is close to home and has been on a \"GOTO\" list for a couple of family members.  So, we dragged the crew down for burgers and fries.  Everyone seemed to like what they ordered and I stuck to an Iced Tea.  I stay away from carbs on most days but, I came close to ordering the skinny fries and a burger as they looked so good.  I can tell you that everyone was happy with their order.  They liked it so much they decided to bring a burger home to have for later.

Maybe on my one day I can eat the carbs, I'll return and mow down a burger or two."}
{"text":"I'm supposed to be eating vegetarian (health, you know) but I decided to have a birthday fling and discovered a Fatburger at Green Valley Ranch resort near the casino. I had never tried a Fatburger before and I must say it was good. Better than McDonald's, and MUCH better than In n' Out Burger. Although they bring your order out to you and seem to take longer than necessary to do so, it is worth the wait. The meat on the hamburger tastes as if it's actually seasoned.  The wedge fries are delicious and don't taste fake.  I hate that I waited until the day before returning to vegetarianism to try Fatburgers, 'cause I'm already plotting my return trip!"}
{"text":"I have to add this: on more than one occasion we've seen the cooks handling buns right after touching raw meat without washing hands or changing gloves. NOT SAFE!"}
{"text":"Omg! The drinks are made well and the burgers are to die for. Also one of the few places I've found in Vegas with gluten free buns! Hells yes!"}
{"text":"It's a burger better then mcdonalds and Burger King. Like that they do the \"fat frys\" also known as steak fries! Don't see them in to many places. They will do extras on your burger that you don't see to much either like egg. All in all not the best not the worst. Something to throw in the belly while wasting your life savings!!!!"}
{"text":"Burger is ok not the best not the worst. Fries hit or miss guess it depends who is cooking. Staff is usually very nice. Went there this week (Monday 6/10/13) for lunch. This time it was some white girl taking orders never seen her before working there but talk about rude and a stupid look on her face!!!! Wow!!! Ill go back but if I see her working the front ill go next door to Subway!!!! And I hate Subway!!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't know what all the hype is about. Burgers are less than mediocre,  almost tasteless. Would not recommend to anyone, save your money and spend it in something that actually tastes like what it costs."}
{"text":"The Fatburger is located in the food court of Sunset Stations. There are seating areas where you can enjoy your food. It's somewhat quiet and out of the casino feeling. 

You can tell the burgers are real meat and hand pressed because they have signs explaining their process  Also, when you get your burger it looks hand made. My husband saw a piece fall off and said it looked homemade-he came in without looking around. So we were all impressed with the appearance. 

The flavor of the Fatburger is good and this is a better Fatburger than others around town. Good management makes a restaurant. The employee was a bit snippy (my son had not seen her before). My husband asked about the condiments that came on the burger and she just pointed. But otherwise a pretty good.

The steak fries were thick with a crispy outside and a soft potatoey (fun word) inside. They were hot out of the fryer and had a good flavor too.

I recommend trying Fatburger if you want a quick lunch while at the casino. It's real food which is sometimes hard to find."}
{"text":"Fat burger is the only place I have ever been to resist food actually looks like the picture on the menu. The prices are really reasonable and they're open 24 hours a day. Every order is cooked fresh just for you.  No heat lamps in this joint! Best Burger on the strip ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered chili cheese fries (without the chili) to eat in. I couldn't finish them as the helping was large and went to close the box to take it home.  To my disgust the outside of box was smothered in oil, burnt flakes and meat grease/particles. I got this all over my hands and nearly threw up. I complained to an employee and she stated it was because they heat the paper box directly on the grill.  I told her I was a vegetarian and it was not sanitary.  She offered a refund but at that point I just felt sick and wanted to get out of there to clean up. Not all my experiences at fatburger have been bad, but in this situation, the serving methods were not clean. I am glad I hadn't ordered another side that would have touched the box."}
{"text":"So so so bad. Didn't even eat. Myself and my 7 year old daughter walk in to a SWELTERING dining room. This is las vegas in the summertime, however I expect a little air conditioning. I figure eh' maybe they just need to turn the air conditioning up. The lady at the register tells me the air conditioning is broken. This was after I ordered 2 burgers, 2 fries 1 drink and a kids meal. It came up to $30. Jesus!, with a dining room that feels like an oven, you would think they'd just give you a freaking cup for free to prevent you from passing out! I must've really wanted this burger because I stayed and paid $30. UNTIL. . Until the cook and register worker began to argue. The cook began to curse and yell at her as she did him. Remember, I'm with my 7 year old. Neither one of them stopped and went to the back with the issue. My daughter and I were the only customers there!  I immediately asked for my refund. I already had my medium drink and my daughter had her kids meal drink. I asked to pay just for the drinks and a refund for the other stuff!  Do you know that my medium drink was $2.99 & my daughters drink that wasn't over 8 Oz was $3.99! I walked out so upset. ..never again"}

{"text":"I love this place more than In-and-out.  Before you start hating me too much, let me explain why.

1.  They will charbroil your burger over a grill if you ask.
2.  They have more variety of toppings, I like a lot of veggies on my burger.
3.  I don't like In-and-out fries that much, hand cut or not.
4.  They serve turkey burgers for those of us who actually care about saturated fat.
5.  The burgers are thicker and generally more flavorful.

Charbroiling the burger just gives this awesome crust on the burger that I find delicious.  Don't get me wrong, I still like In-and-out.  They are much cheaper and convenient so I go there more often than here.

This review is just for the green valley ranch location in Henderson, NV.  I've been to the one in Federal Way, Washington and I absolutely hated it.   Nowhere nearly as well run and delicious as to what they have here."}
{"text":"This location is okay, but I admit I enjoy the Green Valley Ranch location better.  Ifind  they make the burgers way way way too salty, but on the upside they will chargrill your burger if you ask, which I always do.  I like the flavor of the char on the burger when it gets grilled in that manner than on the fryer they use normally.

Honestly, if you're in Red Rock Casino and you want a burger, you should be going to LBS instead of here, it is miles better."}
{"text":"So the funniest thing happened.

We showed up at Fatburger at 9 in the morning on the day we were flying out. We both tweeted \"burgers for breakfast!\" Hooray! We got an order of fries, a 1/3 pound burger, and a veggie burger. I bit into my veggie burger and the first thing I said was \"this is delicious, it tastes like a Big Mac!\" Hooray again!

We get home and I start adding the places we visited to my Yelp bookmarks. What's this I notice? Oh, I already wrote a review for Fatburger! What does it say? Burgers for breakfast and it tastes like a Big Mac.

Whoa. O_o

What else can I say? Almost an exact repeat of last year, the food is great, I loved the shoestring fries and the burgers were perfect! This is definitely worth checking out if you wan a fast food burger without the fast food stigma and grossness."}
{"text":"I really liked the burger, get's 4 stars. Quality meat, veggies, good cheese, cooked right.  The fries were good too.  But $11.30 for the combo, that seems a bit expensive to me.  Thus, 3 stars."}
{"text":"A very mixed experience.

This was our first visit to a Fatburger. When we walked in, I initially want sure if we were going to stay.  We were greeted by a stagnant water/ old mop bucket water smell  Additionally, many of the booths needed cleaned.

But as I said, this was our first time so we thought we'd give it a chance.

We ordered a medium burger, sweet potato fries, milkshake, bottled water, XXL burger, skinny fries, fountain drink.  At a burger place, mind you.  I was shocked at the total- $40.19!!!  For two people, at a burger joint 

I thought to myself, this better be a darn good burger for that price!

Our food arrived and looked appetizing. It was freshly made, hot, and our order was accurate.

The burger was good, but not $40 good.  It lacked seasoning and the cheese to meat ratio was lacking.  The skinny fries were crisp and tasty.  I'm normally a huge sweet potato fan, but these I would pass on next time.

So, I would go back to Fatburger if one of my friends were dying to try it; otherwise, there's other better burger joints that are more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Wow worst experience of my life here. Not worth the price and not worth the visit. There's a great place right next door called boneyard that has burgers for the same price that tastes way better. I ordered a burger that I didn't know had mustard on it so when it came I asked for a new one without mustard. The employee asked me: would you like me to wash the burger for you or do you want a new one? WASH MY BURGER? You just earned yourself a bad review fatburger."}
{"text":"This hit the spot at 6am after a long night of partying, drinking and general shenanigans. We weren't the only ones that felt this way ... There was already quite a line before sunrise. The burger was greasy, well done and the fries were crunchy. 

I ate at least one fat burger each day during my entire stay in Vegas. I also never got a hangover while I was here. Coincidence? I think not. 

In conclusion, Fat Burger. It's stops the hangover before it starts."}
{"text":"Wow, haven't been here in 4 years or so. Especially since 5 guys has come into town. I have to tell you that Fatburger is way better than those other guys."}
{"text":"Service was slow, don't go there if you're on lunch break. I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches, poor choice and crazy EXPENSIVE! The cost for 2 sandwiches, and french fries NO DRINKS-$22.00- The chicken was some kind of rubbery processed junk- Dont bother going here! For $22 I could have got food for a week at In-and Out"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I and 4 of my friends went there to watch the game for our week trip to vegas and when we got there we were excited because they had our game on a picturea of enjoying a nice burger was dancing through our heads....Unfortunately as soon as we sat down the fat non paying barback changed the game so that he could watch his chicago bears play. With a look of disbelief at how he could so blatantly ruin our experience I kindly asked the bartender if he could change it back he said no he couldn't because it was on a revolving channel to which I responded we just sat there an watched your barback change it. After not getting any kind of help I an my friends got up an left. I know our bill would have easily been over 60 bucks a mere drop in the bucket for such a franchise but in the end fatburger has lost 5 paying customers for a lifetime . We ended up back at the time share with some Chinese food ."}
{"text":"Fatburger is a chain on the west coast, for those that have never been. The burgers are indeed \"fat\" as you can get all the way up to 1.5lb worth of meat! They are tasty and fresh to order, but that's where the positives stop..

They are very expensive for a chain \"fast food\" burger joint. When compared to Smash Burger, they are almost double the price. Especially cuz Smash Burger ALWAYS has coupons. Compared to Five Guys, they are less greasy, but more expensive. Compared to In N Out, Fatburger's burgers are larger, but not as tasty, @ double (OR MORE) the price of In N Out. I'd rather buy 2 or 3 In N Out burgers for the price of one Fatburger..

They have two fry types: Thick Steakhouse fries, and \"Skinny\" fries. I'm not a Steakhouse fries fan, cuz they usually are too thick like you're eating mini unflavored baked potatoes. Their Skinny fries taste like Burger King's breaded fries from the 90's and 2000's. Smash Burger's skinny(thin cut) fries, In N Out's skin on fries, and Five Guys' skin on fries, are WAY better. 

All in all, it's good food when you're drunk or out of other burger options, hence why they are in several Station casinos in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ci siamo fermati per un pranzo al volo! Abbiamo preso hotdog e patatine Erano buoni e abbiamo speso il giusto! Acqua ovviamente gratis e corona il lattina (ci sono rimasta scioccata) ma d'altra parte è un semplice fast food !! Abbiamo inoltre comprato la famosa bottiglia con cannuccia ma senza niente all'interno perché volevamo solo la bottiglia i prezzi delle bottiglie sono esagerati in confronto ad altre ripiene.. Questa vuota è costata 19.99 dollari... Piena costava 29.99... Confrontate con altro prezzi che piene le davano a 15 dollari... Quindi conveniente per il pranzo ma non per le bibite in bicchieri particolari che si trovano al baracchino esterno... Tutto sommato il sevizio è veloce e le ragazze molto gentili e disponili riguardo le richieste! Se volete fare uno spuntino veloce questo è il posto adatto!!! Ovviamente non pensiate di mangiare gli hamburger, gli hotdog le patatine o gli anelli di cipolla migliori di las vegas!"}
{"text":"Nice people, regular fare. Don't expect your order quickly.  I had the chicken wrap which was really deep fried chicken fingers.  My wife has the grilled chicken burger served as a salad, but it was basically fried.  Don't fault the folks who work here - they were very friendly and worked as fast as they could."}
{"text":"I have only one word to say about this place: GHETTO!

We went here on a late Saturday night, approx. 3am after a crazy, clubbing night at Jet. Right when we walked in, some customers were having some kind of staring contest or mad dawging contest, and a fight was about to break out! One guy was saying \"Hey dude! Stop looking at me!\" and the other guy just ran up to him, mad dawged him up close and personal, and then said they would take it outside. Once they walked outside, tons of people rushed out...and even the Fatburger WORKERS! Oh my goodness!?!? What happened to customer service? What happened to the security? Well, even the security guard didn't care...he wanted to see it too! 

At any rate, I don't think anything happened. The workers all came back in, and our late night dinner ensued..

My bf and I split a cheeseburger meal. The fries were nice and hot, and tasted ok. The burger was pretty good, as others have told me. Yes, I agree with others that it is better than In-and-Out's old-fashioned take on burgers. 

The place was dirty too! People just leave their trash everywhere, and workers don't clean the areas regularly. You would think that if this restaurant is in some sort of tourist area like the Strip, they would have better service and a more tourist-catered atmosphere. They don't....and it sucks...

If you are craving for that Fatburger, I recommend going somewhere else (and not this stinky, ghetto place)!

I was gonna give this place 1 star, but the burger convinced me to be a bit more generous, so I gave it another.."}
{"text":"Ok. so in theory, this should be a good burger.  Similar in style to other freestyle patty establishments and marketing the calories, I figured it would at least have some flavor.  I ordered the smallest 1/3 lb burger.  They have 1/2 lb, 1 lb and a king size burger as well.

The product I got caused memories of old sitcom sketches where they squeeze the patty in their armpits.  (PLEASE NOTE, THE RESTAURANT AND EMPLOYEES APPEARED VERY CLEAN AND I AM NOT IMPLYING ANY HEALTH HAZARDS)

Simply put, the oddly shaped, grey patty was unappetizing. Inside, not a shred of pink was to be found.

The 1 lb burger was simply 2 patties so looked just as unappetizing.

They upcharge you on everything so the three of us paid nearly $40.00 for two adult burger combos and a kids meal.

The buns were boring and soggy.

The burger tasted ok but lacked any special flavor.  In fact, the tomatoes, pickles, onions, mustard and other toppings completely drowned out any possible flavor from the meat instead of enhancing it.

The fat fries were very good and you salt them yourself so that saved it from a 1 star review."}
{"text":"We came for lunch and there were seven in our party. It took over 45 minutes for everyone to get their food order. I wouldn't go there if you have a short lunch period."}
{"text":"What a joke, guys on the street giving 2 for 1 coupons. You go inside, order a well drink which then costs you $13! Come on... What kind of scam is this. I'm used to expensive drinks on the strip, but this is over the top."}
{"text":"Growing up I went to the fat burger in l.a.. on my vacation now. So glad to find a fat burger. If only there was a checkers too. U guys rock fat burger"}

Fatburger! Fatburger! Fatburger! 

Ok, I'm done with excitement over here. My one and only time enjoying a Fatburger was at Chase Field. And(!) it was during a sleep over. So, yes, I was very excited.

Fatburger! Fatburger! Fatburger! 

As part of the overnight experience (to season ticket holders) dinner was provided.

Fatburger! Fatburger! Fatburger! 

I was impressed with how streamlined the order process was. No exceptions to the dressings. (Zip it kid!)

And like that, I was presented with my big burger. And a huge side of fries!"}
{"text":"Used to be a fan, but no longer. $13.55 for the smaller burger, fries, and a soda is outrageous. And the burger  is worse now. Meat not fried hi temp and crusty but tasting almost steamed, and the bun was barely heated and bready instead of hot and toasted. Sad but true. Also no apparent  free parking anymore. Went late and had park in back and hope I didn't get towed. 

The LA founder must be very upset. Not true to the Fat Burger quality and service anymore."}
{"text":"Best fat burgs I ever had!!!!!! Super juicy!! Fat fries are the only way to go!!!! Make sure u put egg bacon an cheese on yours to make it complete! Mallory was fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was there about a wk ago, and they were really nice, half way through my meal I see a spider on my leg, I show them all they say is that's gross and that was it, I had to go and ask for a refund, and all they refunded me for was the fries. I wasted 22 dollars there. I will not eat there again, and being pregnant it was just disgusting."}
{"text":"Got take out and I really liked the food. I got a hamburger with cheese & bacon. The bacon was good, thick and cooked right. The food was made fresh right there were you can see. I got the steak fries but I will try the skinny fries next time. The fries were good but I just prefer the skinny ones (my hubby ran in for us). I am happy to find a good burger place that doesn't taste all greasy and with the gross oils they use now. We will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"Inspired by recent Talk, this rating simply must be updated.

Fatburger has a QUALITY-quality that places it in a wierd limbo between other fast food burgers and places like Fuddruckers.

If you are a fan of the king, either of the two clowns, or the red haired girl, then Fatburger is likely to feel too expensive and that it takes too long.

However, 'you get what you pay for' and 'good things are worth waiting for'.  

Freshness, a multitude of assembly choices, and overall quality are big standouts at Fatburger.  The employees at this location have always been friendly and courteous.

Tuesdays: buy a combo, get another burger free!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a great burger this is not the place but if you are looking for something that is hands above other fast food burgers this is your spot. 

First time at this location and it was not as good as my experiences in the south location. Got the reg fatburger with cheese fires and drink for 2 ( with a shake) almost $25. I not all that filling should have went for the king or even bigger but for what I had already paid thought I should not leave looking for the next place to eat. 

Service was good but a bit on the hovering around side but its better then the place being dirty.

Would go back but maybe just for a shake or one of the other snacks."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it.  It is a typical burger joint but with above average food.  I had the skinny burger and onion rings.  I would eat there again."}
{"text":"$14 for a small cheeseburger, fries and small drink, which is on the pricey side. The employees are not friendly. They look and act like cholos trying to be professional with oldies music in the background."}
{"text":"This place was empty and I should have known better.  I ate at a Fatburger years ago.  It's not a bad place, but just so overpriced for fast food.  I have rarely \"craved\" a Fatburger.  This location has nice outdoor seating at the Desert Ridge shopping center where you can people watch.  Other than that it's a pretty standard Fatburger."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. 30 minute wait for my burger which ended up being burnt. After we waited 30 minutes for our food  we went to ask them the status. The lady rudely told us that the food wasn't ready since we just got here. Good luck ever getting a 5 star. We won't ever be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a little more expensive vs Wendy's or BK, but I feel the taste and quality is worth it. I usually get the Kingburger w/ cheese and it's just shy of six bucks. Also, you can call or fax ahead to save time, if you choose.

The only thing I don't like is its location, it's in a stripmall on the South side of Peoria, in-between a Subway and Sizzler Grill. Getting back onto Peoria can be a chore. :("}
{"text":"It's a known fact that I don't eat hamburgers, so I will not be reviewing all'a'that. Anyway, so after eating some delicious pad thai at Pho Kim Long, I had a killer hankering for ice cream. What's open after midnight in this town? Basically nothing. My friend Jerry J. suggested we stop by Fatburger so that he could get some food and that I could try one of their milkshakes. On (8/27/11) at about 2 AM we made it to Fatburger. 

This place was popping. It was super busy - we were like 3rd or 4th in line. As somebody that loves to cook, I really don't condone spending $8 on a burger, sans fries and a drink. I think it's a crazy waste of money. That said, it seems people don't care and are eating this stuff like crack. I told Jerry I was in no way spending $4 on a milkshake so... I was good. He insisted I tried, like, literally insisting I try this drink and paid for the milkshake. It was good - but not worth the money.  Strawberry Haagen Dazs + milk + whipped cream = same thing but  X10 the calories. YIKES! 

If you're a hamburger addict, I guess this place would be your jam."}
{"text":"I went to Fat Burger for the first  time last month. I ordered a medium fat burger with mushrooms, no mustard. The bun was crispy and warm and the burger itself was all around pretty good."}
{"text":"Good but they need to add a little more seasoning. Very bland.  The best place we had the 4 nights we where there."}
{"text":"Fatburger should pull this franchise, it's a disgrace to the brand. Absolutely glacial \"service\" (I use the term loosely), and if there's a line of people ahead of you, forget it - unless you've got a LOT of time on your hands. Whoever runs the food court here needs to be fired and replaced by somebody who knows what they're doing - right now, it's a mongolian clusterfarkle. And has been for as long as I can remember."}
{"text":"As much a part of my Vegas experience as the dancing fountains at The Bellagio. 

   10:30 am on Sunday morning in Las Vegas. I call it \"The Hole\". You've pushed your senses as far as they will go all Friday and Saturday. By the time you land in The Hole, the mere mention of alcohol will induce a geyser from deep within your guts. Some fat girl is drinking a yard of beer at this hour and I have to look away. A group of hommies looks and sounds like they haven't been to bed yet. The cashier hollers out my order as if he has turrets. Ah, back to normal. 

   The medicine is a XX cheeseburger , add the egg please and a massive Diet Coke. Last stop is the gas station for Tylenol, Jerky and a lot of water. It's a long drive back to San Diego. There will be plenty of time to do the post game wrap up of the weekend on my 4 + hour drive. 

    Ah Vegas, till' next time."}
{"text":"Directly on the strip with parking. Open in the wee morning. Cooked to order. Interesting clients. Grumpy cashier. Friendly bussers. Pretty clean and efficient. Gobble it down and you're gone."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times tried a veggie burger for the first time and loved it it was juicy not dry and you can add grilled onions to the burger yum yum.  The time that is listed for opening is wrong they actually open at 7:00am."}
{"text":"This joint is kind of ghetto, especially if you're just coming from a fancy casino, but the burgers are da bomb.  freshly made, so juicy.  Get your burger with the fried egg -- you won't regret it.  And get the \"fat\" fries.  Free refrills on sodas too."}
{"text":"Visited FatBurger for the first time this past Sunday, and was thoroughly impressed. Loved the vibe in there, and the food was outstanding.
 
Pro's:
 
1)      The quality of the beef can definitely be tasted in each bite. Its great, cooked perfectly, and is overall delicious. I believe they use AAA Alberta Beef.  They also have a lot of sizes to choose from, so could be tailored towards an appetite of any size. I got the 12 ounce - which was 2 x 6oz patties. Loved it!
 
2)      The fries - I know some people have a problem with the frozen fries, but personally, I loved them. Thought they tasted good, had the right flavour and crispness to them. Very surprised.
 
3)      Toppings - Large amount of free toppings, including Onion Rings! Wish the mushrooms were included, but an extra surcharge for that isn't too bad.
 
4)      Great selection of items on the menu. Its not simply a burger joint, they have things like chicken wings, chicken strips, salads, and a variety of French fries, including chilli-cheese fries. Tried the chicken strips, and they were delicious. Seemed fresh, perfect amount of batter, and came with your choice of sauce.
 
5)      The burger held together!!! Often when you take a burger to go, and put a variety of toppings on it, it falls apart on the way home. I was surprised to see how perfectly intact the burger was by the time I got home. I believe the bun has a lot to do with that, not overly soft, but perfect for the size of the burger.
 
 
Cons:
 
1)      The cost is definitely one of the only Con's I can think of. A meal here isn't cheap, but then again its not your standard fast food burger. The 12 ounce burger ran me $9.99, fries were $3.49, and 4 large chicken strips (same size as Jack Astors) was around $7 bucks.
 
 
Overall Verdict: Go Here!!! Food is great, variety is excellent, lots of parking. I've had burgers all over the city, including Burger Priest, Holy Chuck, P&L etc, but surprisingly, this might be my go to spot now!"}
{"text":"Came here after a long night on the strip with a few friends. Couldn't say this spot was anything extraordinary for a burger but the quality was pretty good. 

Portions were average but the prices were steep... $8 (approx.) for a whopper with some better quality meat. Fries and soda are extras as well. 

Anyhow the place is clean, def a good spot that'll be open no matter how late you're up on the strip."}
{"text":"Fat fries are good, but that's probably it. I had a turkey burger that didn't taste much better than something I could make in my microwave. I had \"everything\" but still could barely taste anything. 3 stars is because my brother had an L and it was really L. His also looked much better than mine did. All in all, it is better than most fast food, but really isn't worth it for the price you pay. Your wallet would thank you for hopping across the street to In 'n' Out, and your tastebuds would thank you for driving several miles east to 5 guys."}
{"text":"cool , decent hamburger spot.  The location is great, right on the strip.  Great food after a good day/night of drinking.  Burgers were good, u can add on some items, like eggs, bacon, chili.  That's to give your mouth more flavors to enjoy.  The burgers are big, not like you typical burger shacks. I would dine here again and recommend."}
{"text":"A coworker recommended we check out Fatburger while in Las Vegas, and it did not disappoint!

Conveniently located right on the strip, Fatburger is a small, loud, busy place.  You literally have to grab the first table or counter seat that opens up.  When your food is ready, a runner calls out the number and you just wave them over.  They bring you your food which is a nice touch for a fast food joint.

The burgers were great!  Greasy in a good way, with fresh toppings.  My husband and I tried both the skinny fries and onion rings, the latter of which really impressed me.  A little expensive but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Tried for first time tonight, had small burger and skinny fries.burger was burnt and dry, oh so bad.fries were good up there with in and out.But forget the burger.Even adding more ketchup couldn't save this burger.Better off going across the street to Wendy's and getting a .99 cent burger.never will go back again."}
{"text":"Perfect area, good food, and good environment. Food is good and seems like the staff likes their jobs so it makes the experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"Fat burger makes a big fresh hamburger that is pretty good.
Kind of like steak n shake on roids type place.
1. Portillo's.   
2. Five Guys
3. Fat burger
4. Smashburger
5. Steak n' Shake"}
{"text":"Good burger. Walked in at 2 am with 2 pac blasting and the staff dancing. Lol. Loved it."}
{"text":"Fat FAIL! By far one of the worst Fatburgers I have been to.

Four people working, yet couldn't seem to produce burgers at a speedy efficient rate. We waited forever. Asked to \"dine in\" yet our food was packed up to go and we had to retrieve it.

Watched my burger made incorrectly twice. And then when I finally got it my onions were hardly \"grilled\" and the meat was pink and the patty not pressed properly. Cheese halfway off the patty and wrapped around the bottom bun.

Far too busy socializing!

No loyalty programs!! As a Fatburger GVR regular I was very disappointed when I was told I would not receive punches on my Loyalty Card. Another GVR plus is: bring your receipt back within two weeks and receive free fries with your burger purchase. No such luck here. Give your regulars a reason to be loyal to you and they will.

I expected far better."}
{"text":"I'll give it to them, they have me by the buns. I love Fatburger and this location has it down as far as service and wait time. My one and only complaint is we have seen hotel employees seated at (and occupying) the entire \"bar.\" I find this inappropriate and think the employees should yield seats to guests at busy times and/or eat in employee break areas."}
{"text":"Good quality burger. The fat fries were good. My wife loved her cookies and cream shake. But they keep the bathrooms locked which is a big negative in my book and I think they let the p - traps dry out cause in crush spots near for drains you could smell sweet gas....yuck."}
{"text":"I've had better burgers before. Fries were pretty good. Definitely wouldn't pay that price again, too expensive. Place was kind of dirty."}
{"text":"Living in the Midwest we do not have Fatburger but they use to sell that patties at Walmart which my family liked. Coming to Vegas I decided to give it a try and have to say I was sorely disappointed. Order a large which by the menu would lead me to believe it was 2 beef patties but it was only one and really the flavor was poor. The fries were not very good either. The saving grace was the milkshake, very good and the only reason I bumped to 2star instead of one. Will not repeat."}
{"text":"Great food again. Burgers were tasty, and fries too. 8:30 PM on a Saturday and the place was empty...WHY? This is a superior hamburger."}
{"text":"Nasty. Plain and simple.

I am sure this is the place to grub when you're drunk and don't notice the paint flakes from the chipped-up floor mingling in with your burger, or the caulking from the broken bathroom sink in your fingernails.

The inside of this place is worse than a gas station.  You'd think from the money they pull in from this place they could get a new floor put in and redo the bathroom... WTF?!?

25 minutes to get a burger when we went at 7pm... I could get a starter and entree in that time from 90% of restaurants out there.  Despite that, the burger came out cold. Fries are frozen crap etc etc.

Stay the hell out of this place."}
{"text":"Eeh, okay burger, huge price tag. Husband actually thought the burger was very good, just way too much mustard on it for his liking. He said he will try again....I'll go to 5 Guys instead."}
{"text":"Old fashion burgers, fries and milk shakes. Remodeled venue. You can eat inside at the high stool bar, tables or outside with the flaming heat lamps."}
{"text":"Omg!  The worst meal ever !  Ordered ahead via phone. Went to pick up and they had no idea about my order. So I reordered at the counter and waited. ALL 3 burgers came out burnt!  Not over cooked burnt with one whole side covered in black char. Really ? They have no idea what they are doing in there. 

The French fries were soggy and the sweet potato fries were covered in salt and pepper and soft. 

Never never never going there again. A waste of $47. Nauseated!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I may have been in an altered state of conciousness when I hit up Fatburger. Not so much from the alcohol per se, but from the pain in my feet from walking about 34 miles from the bar at another hotel back to mgm. In heels.
All I know is that fatburger was like the oasis in the desert. Onion rings and a ginormous milk shake was perfection."}
{"text":"Better than standard burger fare, but no In-and-Out. 
That said, 10 STARS for the milk shakes. AMAZING! We couldn't get enough! 

Jukebox is fun."}
{"text":"Rude staff. They all seemed like they didn't want to be there. They messed up out order and put mayo on both burgers instead of ketchup and when I went to address the problem there was no apology, just an eye roll. I wasn't rude so I'm not really sure what caused this reaction. When she gave us our new burgers she still never apologized for the inconvenience and they were burnt. 

Won't be coming here again. I don't want to feel like I'm burdening everyone by even coming in to their establishment."}
{"text":"Veg burgers in Vegas.  I was ecstatic!  Add on the skinny fries, and you have a great meal for about $8 and for Green Valley Ranch, that is a huge bargain."}
{"text":"$10 burger with some unimpressive guacamole, cheese, and an egg added on. The large burger is quite filling, and honestly, the taste isn't bad, but I think it's a bit overprice, and relative to expectations, a little disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is open way past 9pm.  In fact I think it's 24 hours.  I just know my receipt says 345am.  MAYBE because it was a weekend.  Okay now to the nitty gritty.  Have you ever had a fatburger before? Okay remember this IS a chain...so that means the burgers whether in NYC, LA, Dtown, MIA or Vegas...they WILL taste the same and NO you are NOT missing anything by waiting to go back home.  

The service...ONE guy was really nice and chipper and we waited too long to decide what we wanted so the other guy took care of us and well he was long overdue going home it seems.

Yes the burgers are pricey, and what puts this place over the 3 stars is the FULL bar! FULL BAR AND BURGERS! and  they are not skimpy with the pour on that liquor! 

so 4 stars because it's a decent burger, it's open at and indecent time and you have a full bar in a cool outdoor atmosphere RIGHT on the strip! Nice to be out and in the mix."}
{"text":"Easy to get to, friendly staff. This place could use a deep cleaning dirty tabletops, messy self serve area the walls and glass through were covered in dirt and grease."}
{"text":"Well the burger tasted just like a BigMac and they just had one server for about 100 guests so the service was very slow even though 3 guys (i guess securities or managers walked around several times) Poor girl. Better spend your money at In-N-Out"}
{"text":"Gross! Just don't go! Don't waste your money or your time! I went after an appt that I had right next door and I decided to go through the drive thru, there was one car in front of me after he ordered I ordered my diet coke and skinny fries with chili and cheese. I waited  20 minutes in the drive through till I finally got to the window. When I pulled up they took my money and handed me my food. I looked in the bag and pulled out my COLD chili cheese fries! I told them it was cold and they said well we put cheese on it... um No its cold! So the lady says well do you want more chili on it? No... no I want a fresh order I have been in line for 20 minutes! So she rolled her eyes and made me a new one 4 minutes later she handed me my $9 chili fries and sent me on my way.. let me rephrase they charged me $9 when I shouldn't have been charged more then  $4 it was terrible, small and not worth it at all! Save your money and your time go somewhere else! Anywhere else!"}
{"text":"GROOOOSSSSS!!!! IDK how do people actually enjoy their burgers :X *Barf
The only reason why I THINK people go here is because their open 24 hours serving disgusting burgers... Roaming around the strip drunk in the am anything sounds/taste delicious right?! WRONG!!!! 

By the time it was 6am in Vegas i was seriously craving for a mchicken across the street after EDC but little did my idiotic brain knew that mcd was serving breakfast :(( booo! so we opted to go to fatburger since we were all craving for \"burgers\" We waited in line looking at their menu and decided to go w/ their medium burger. 

The employee who took my order not only was falling asleeep on me, she asked me for my order 3x's and not only was she confused I WAS CONFUSED!! i was not frustrated at all although i was drunk ordering my food, i felt bad cause she told me she was working a long shift and she couldn't wait to go home... 

When i got my order i asked for ketchup and she told me they didn't have any?! what the f****** what kind of burger joint doesn't have any ketchup?! s0o i asked another employee and he actually gave me some.. lol 

When we got back into our hotel i opened my burger with excitement ready to devour that sh*t and the burger was cold and soft... disgusting and it tasted to PLAIN. i opened my bun and there WAS NO KETCHUP OR ANYTHING..... Was i suppose to order a burger w/ ketchup?! i thought it usually comes w/ condiments w/o being said?! 

You don't go to mcd and burger king ordering a burger and say \"Oh don't foget the ketchup, pickles, mustard, and onions\" -___-"}
{"text":"Service was great. Got my food fast, how  I ordered it. Place was clean, even though I ordered to go but I was satisfied"}
{"text":"Wow- awful service. People there just take their time and are lazy forgetting things you ordered."}
{"text":"BIG FAT GREASY BURGER with steak fries and a soda.  Need I say more!!!  This is a must stop while you are in LV.  Just another experience of Sin City...why not commit the sin of gluttony, excess fat and calories and everything that is completely bad for you!!!

BUT there is a positive...WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS STAYS IN VEGAS!!!"}
{"text":"I found myself here at 5am...yes 5am. After being rudely awakened by someone's Gatling gun, I mean someone's nose. I swear, always find out who snores in your Vegas plans, and kick them out! Anyway my boyfriend and I hit up the strip to find out who the real Las Vegan crazies are. It was quite warm outside, even at the crack'o'dawn. 

After passing a group of dude-bros standing on the corner reaching for Budweiser cans from the box they brought along, past the drunks staggering all over the place, a real live Elvis impersonator, past the barefooted club chicks who had long since given up trying to walk in their heels, we came across the 24 hour fat burger.

I could go for some fries and a milkshake...that sounded remotely like breakfast, I thought. Anyway, inside, we were greeted by the same group of people. Drunk club goers, dude-bros and many other interesting characters. The girls in front of us were leaning all over the registers screaming \"I want salt on my burger!\"...by the time we were served, the guy was either deaf or just a little slow. It took us 5 minutes to order fries and a shake. He kept asking, \"you want vanilla shake??VANILLA??\"

We set up camp in the corner by the window, and people watched till our food came. One fellow was using his soda cup as a barf receptacle. The girls who wanted salt on their burgers were now shouting about who's boyfriend was who's. When our food came we gulped down the tasty shake, and munched on our fries and discussed where to go next at 5:30am. 

Definitely one of my favorite Las Vegas experiences!"}
{"text":"Our family has used this location for sometime now.. Maybe 10-12 years.

The food quality is very consistent, and the service is what is to be expected from a drive-thru. The orders are repeated, and the staff use term like \"please, and thank you\".

I have read other reviews complaining about inaccurate charges in the drive-thru but from my experience my receipts show exactly what I ordered and the cost I expected to pay.

The cleanliness is what keeps me from five stars on this establishment. Stickers and graffiti tend to me regular occurrences on the drive thru wall and window.

We will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Do not go here. We ordered 2 medium fat burger meals, and chicken strips meal for $30 and it took them 30 minutes to get food through the drive thru. Then when we got our food it was missing the fries which they said we didn't order. WTF?! How does the whole meal cost $30 and doesn't come with fries?! When I complained to management, he said we'd have to pay more and it would take another 20 minutes! This is all garbage. Because of this store, I will NEVER stop at another fat burger."}
{"text":"I must after my not so pleasant experience at this location. Fatburger reach out to me. Apologized, and sent me a letter and fat checks. They also informed me they would reach out to that location. I used one of the checks at the same location. So this is my honest report. They were very nice. I was greeted and they took my order made no mistakes. I didn't have to wait to long to receive my order.  It was a great experience. I respect Fatburger Corp for taking responsibility for what happen and make a adjustments after."}
{"text":"WOW! This burger place is unbelievable, I really recommend this place. They have great food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We waited forever for our food when we were the only ones in the place eating. We could barely understand our what our waitress was saying. My friends burger had a footlong hair in it. We will NEVER eat here again. TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"The best late night stop on Vegas strip.  Burgers are amazing.  Make sure you add the bacon and egg. The addition of the outdoor bar and seating area makes it the perfect place to people watch on a hot summer night.  Waitresses are super friendly and cute."}
{"text":"We pulled up to the front of Fatburger and there was only 4 parking spaces which were like 15 minute zones. As there was a security guard watching the place, I asked her if we could park there and she said go right ahead.

Anyway, I went in to order some take out and I picked out a Large Fatburger. The menu was easy to understand and when I got my food it tasted great.

I'll be back for some more the next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Let me tell you,  if you're going to eat here you had better be hungry cause, even a single is a Big burger. If you do the \"XXXL CHALLENGE \" and finish it which is a three Patty burger along with the rest of the items that gord with a burger,  You will have your picture taken and put in their \"WALL OF FRAME\" .. I think what they do now is put you Instagram.  They also give you a Certificate pretty much saying that you ate the WHOLE THING."}
{"text":"Yea it's kinda pricey and yea it costs extra to add things like cheese, bacon, egg, etc.. But its pretty darn good.. I think so atleast. This location in particular is cool because its open 24 hours.. on the other hand, the employees weren't too friendly and the place wasn't too clean.. But aside from that!! This place has become a MUST for the bf whenever we go to vegas or even tahoe. He likes to get the triple king burger.. or whatever its called. the biggest one! if i'm really hungry i'll get the fatburger with bacon and cheese.. if im not as hungry i'll get the babyfat burger which is a cute little burger haha.. My friends ordered theres with egg and they said it was really good, too. I like the chili cheese fries as well. Yum yum.. wish i could have some right now.."}

budiness hour.
sunday to thursday  8:00 am to 3:00 am
friday and saturday open until 4:00 am"}
{"text":"This was probably the cheapest meal we had in Vegas. I like these guys better than In-and-Out but they still don't do it for me. Coming from Texas, I say Whataburger still wins my heart...and clogs my arteries. The burgers were fresh and the fries/rings were decent. A few guys added a fried egg to their burgers and said it was pretty good. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this Fatburger when I visited today; the staff was super friendly and the place was spotless. I am a picky eater so I ordered my food special and received it just as I ordered it. On that note, the preparation was quick and I was in and out in about 10 minutes. Great service and awesome food."}
{"text":"When we walked in Saturday at around 6:30 for dinner we were the only ones in the place.  The two employees were sitting at one of the tables looking like the last thing they wanted to do was get up and actually have to cook something.

The tables were dirty.

No one was in there.

They were sitting on their *sses and half the tables were filthy.

When our food finally arrived, they sat right back down and resumed doing nothing with each other and had pretty filthy mouths.  I'm colombian.  I look pretty latin too.  What made them think I wouldn't understand them.

When your the only ones in a place and you get up to leave and no one asks, \"how was everything\" or says something (...er like customer service 101) \"thanks for coming in\" -- then I'd say there's some pretty fundamental problems happening.

The worst part, as we were driving out of the parking lot...We saw an In & Out Burger!!!!!!!!!!! And...it was packed.

Big mistake going to this place.  I've been to FatBurger before...a few times in California. Not a bad burger.  This place is managed horribly with lazy employees.

Do not go here.  Check out the In&Out Burger at the rear of the parking lot. :)"}
{"text":"We made the mistake of going in this Fatburger on the strip, The place was packed.
We kept hearing how great the burgers are here. I have to say we did not think
they were anything special. At least we did not think so. They are just a hamburger and we didn't see anything so fat about them.
The place was so busy not one place to sit down. I think In & Out is much better than this place and taste much fresher.
Unless we ordered the wrong burger... Plus it took awhile with them being so busy, 
I think I will stick to In & out when I want a burger fast. 
I would not come back here to this location its just not a place for locals even when you come to the strip, Maybe sometime try a different location.
Not our favorite place."}
{"text":"The worst fat burger I 've ever been too. Prices are $5 6$ more than at any other fat burger. Long wait time even when there are not that many customers and they have about 10 employees working at the same time. Very rude manager. They litetally threw some stuff together instead of putting it in a bun and gave it to me. When I returned it and asked to make into a burger they literally packages all the bits separately and gave it back to me. Rather go to McDonald's than here"}
{"text":"Horrible service will never go back , food is okay I had better burgers. I order $60 worth of food, for such a small place you expect better service from their staff but I find them very rude and they don't even acknowledge you."}
{"text":"Burger was mediocre at best. Staff was ok but just ok. When will restaurants that are hiring staff who have people skills. That's maybe a lost art these days. Got a combination of skinny fries and fat fries. Skinny fries were great but the fat fries were undercooked. I guess next time I'll just get skinny fries. If it wasn't at the Green Valley Ranch casino I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Bad customer service as soon as they found out I am using groupon. However, the burger itself was nice, and a handful selection of toppings."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  We had a burger and a chicken sandwich with fries. The sandwiches were awesome.  The fries were ok but they had been sitting under the heat lamp while our food cooked so they were barely warm. I would definitely come again.  The 4 stars was because the fries were not hot."}
{"text":"Great hamburger chain. I always loved Fatburger in California. Nice to have it in a casino and available easily."}
{"text":"I came to Fatburger in the afternoon with a large group of very hungry friends. We were expecting a long line and lots of wait time, but to our surprise when we arrived we were some of the first in the very short line. 

We all ordered various things and the nice thing about the menu is that there is a burger for every appetite! I ordered the small Fatburger, a friend ordered the large Fatburger, another friend ordered the skinny burger (no bun) and so on.. 

We did not have to wait long to get our food and I was satisfied with my burger. It was pretty standard, nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered it with a side of skinny fries which I really enjoyed. 

All in all, I would come back"}

But for real, I was surprised by the quality of service that I received inside of this location, as I've never received that level of care from a Fatburger location before. Yes, we had our food delivered to the table like they normally do, but we also had someone come around and make sure that we had everything we needed, just like you'd expect from a formal restaurant. In addition, I was really surprised by the fact that they have a liquor license! Maybe I'm just a bit naive, but I really didn't think that an establishment such as Fatburger would have the drive to get a liquor license here in Canada, but I will say, it almost convinced me to get a drink for that reason! Buuuut I was more convinced to get a milkshake instead and for that, I have zero regrets.

I went with the Mushroom Swiss specialty burger with fries, and boy oh boy, was that a satisfying meal. First thing to eat while back in Calgary for the holidays and I ALSO have zero regrets about that. I went for a two-flavour milkshake and combined the Oreo with the Mocha Java... OH MY WORD, it was one of the best milkshakes I've had in a long time. My sister got the Fatburger Jr and we were both quite full afterwards. All in all, good meal, good service, good time."}
{"text":"mmmm... Fatburger.  Delicious.  Fat.  Burgers.  Freshly made, which is so appreciated.  Kind of messy, but totally worth it.  Compared to In N Out, this is the joint you should go to if you're really really craving meat.  In N Out is nice if you want a burger, but don't want to keel over after eating it.  I love one of their ads - \"Beware of psychic burger joints.  You know, the ones who make your burgers before you order them.\"  Hee.  The milkshakes were bomb too, all thick and made with real ice cream.  Order Fat Fries (the fries here sooo much better than In N Out), or get the Chili Cheese Fries which come highly recommended."}
{"text":"Eh...take your business to 5 Guys.
Service was great, thr only thing I cannot complain about. 
Burgers were dry, overcooked, and tasteless.
We were less than impressed.
And if anyone likes this burger joint...then you haven't tried a good burger. 
Go with 5 Guys. They have amazing burgers."}
{"text":"I was actually really excited about this place when I came here for the first time. Then, when I tried their burgers, I wasn't impressed, I've had much better elsewhere for the same price as Fat Burger. It was good to try once anyway...The only way I will get this next time, is with Groupon probably..maybe even not. 

Its way to too crowded, again not worth. Also, the chairs outside, not comfortable. I like how they have a bar outside though. Not sure what they sell there, as I didn't order any alcoholic drinks, but still cool they have a bar outside. Fat Burger is also 24hrs, which is convenient. I think I'll come here next time when I'm way too drunk, not just to eat. LOL"}
{"text":"Good service which was a plus! I agree that burgers were good size and they do toast the buns nicely.

I got a medium burger (mayo, onion, lettuce) which was way overcooked =\.
Girlfriend got Grey Poupon burger which was both overcooked and SALTY to the point of near inedibility.  It was a relief to eat a bite of the bun without the burger. 

I strongly recommend the nearby In n Out or Chick Fil A instead."}
{"text":"Good service efficient people friendly customer service explain the menu very well to me but like I stated on my tip no  burgers medium rare anymore not even medium have to be dead well done shakes a very tasty good deals only with Gruponn otherwise paying almost 20 bucks for a complete meal."}
{"text":"This review is for this particular location only. Early morning visit approx 3am.

Recent visit:

The service was poor, just a bad experience that nobody should have to endure, especially at 3am. I am the only customer in the drive thru, keep in mind is approx 3am. We spent exactly 24 minutes sitting in the drive thru, yes i took note of the time waiting on our order which was nothing crazy, two burgers, two fries, and two milkshakes which cost us $33.00. 

The service was bad, no apologies for the delay, attitude as if we were bothering them in making them cook at 3am even though they are 24/7. I was way passed pissed when we rolled out of there to say the least! 

Note to DM: The night shift crew needs some customer service skills and time management training. 

I am dissapointed that I have to do a review like this from such a bad experience.

I will give Fatburger another chance, will just avoid this location and the graveyard shift, I won't forget this last visit, just unbelievable! Shame on them!"}
{"text":"Bad customer 2 people working on Saturday night then have older lady working register and she needs help like especially its n casino wow terrible terrible got to do better"}
{"text":"Service without a smile but looking to sober up...this is your place :)"}
{"text":"This place make good burgers, hot dogs, and shakes.  It is not cheap there though.  They do give you a ton of options to put on your burger, but some of them you have to pay for and that can add up.  This really isn't fast food.  Its cooked to order and if its busy it could take a while.  They always get my order right, which is a huge plus for me.

I usually have them delivered, which you can do from multiple delivery services, before watching the knights."}
{"text":"Worst fatburger in the whole city, always smells like burnt grease, employees all look dirty,few times eating there can't get order right"}
{"text":"Burgers are ok but they are a little overpriced and can really vary in taste depending on who's on the grill. They also take a while to make and if it's busy you might have to wait about 25 minutes for your order. You could probably get the same burger at Ihop or Denny's for the same price at 2am."}
{"text":"Ok, yes this place is on the pricey side, yes the the service is a bit slow but I recommend at least trying it once.

The family was in the area and needed some grub stat; we had eaten here before in the summer and it was somehow better...

I ordered the chicken grilled and hubby had the huge double, kids had the cheese burgers.  The people at the till shout it out to the back and the kids got a kick out of that!  You have to order your fries and drinks separately but the kids meals come with fries and a treat. No McMeals here.

The decor has that nostalgic 50's era vibe which I loved and the kids especially loved filling their drinks to their hearts desire.

Burgers and fries came piping hot.  Patties tasted handmade, and juicy.  I had no complaints, both were good burgers all around and the fries were crisp and delicious.

I think that this place is one of those joints you hit up every now and again because the bill was pretty steep at $35 but I would pay more any day of the week for quality.  A solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Sad....just sad..

After hearing it was suppose to be the best burgers in town, I decided to try it out. It was dry and over cook.. Not very tasty and it might as well been your standard Burger King.."}
{"text":"Just like the fatbuger on the strip, come late night (2am), it's filled with drunkies galore. I couldn't help but laugh when this group of British guys behind me in line gave the cashier their names of Batman and Robin with strait faces with their thick British accents for when their order was ready.  

Thought I could out smart the man by picking up Fatburger instead of room service. Not really. A medium sized meal with fries and drink came out to $10 and it tasted like crap. The burger was dry and the fries insanely greasy and tasteless. 

Should have done room service since the guys who work here are slow and it took about 35 minutes from when I first stood in line til I got my food.  

Pretty crappy drunk food.

Now I see why people go gaga over In-n-Out.

{"text":"Burger joints are a dime a dozen in a town like Las Vegas. You have places like In n Out on the top of the quick service burger food chain and then places like....Umm..... (insert not so favorite/Yelp one star burger place here)

And then, you have a place like FATBURGER. Yes, it's a chain burger joint that serves up burgers both big and small.... or more of Small-XXL but what sets them apart from other chains is..... their list of toppings! Specifically, a fried egg. 

HOW AWESOME IS THAT? FRIED EGG PLUS A LITTLE BACON ON TOP OF THAT GROUND BEEF AND YOU KNOW WHAT? BRUNCH BETWEEN TWO BUNS, THAT'S WHAT!

Ok.... Maybe I am a little odd getting excited over adding a cholesterol laden fried egg on my burger that already has cheese and bacon but... what can I say? 

I love me some brunch in a bun! LOL"}
{"text":"it's fatburger.... marked up for vegas but still delicious and worth it. hits the spot every time. way better than in n out."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for a great shake, and man are theirs good. Got the chocolate today and it was spot on; thick but still drinkable, rich but not too sweet or syrupy and topped with a real whip cream dome. I still haven't tried a burger lol but the shakes are awesome"}
{"text":"Wow - first time at fatburger and it was awesome!!!!  You can add pretty much anything you want to your burger, I had mayo, fried onions, cheese, pickles and lettuce and it hit the spot.  We had chili cheese fries that were about what you'd expect , pretty good but nothing special.  Long wait for the food (20 min) but it was worth the wait.  Central location on the strip, near MGM , across the street from the Monte Carlo.  I just wish they had these in MN!"}
{"text":"I was told so many great things about this place but my entire experience was awful. The food wasn't very good, way too greasy. My fries were luke warm and my tray was literally covered in grease. I needed about 50 napkins and a shower after that. The service was pretty awful too. I can't believe I paid $14 for a small meal with no extra fixings. On national cheeseburger day of all days too. Such a disappointment and I've never gone back since. Best thing about it was the soda, but that's pretty difficult to mess up."}
{"text":"All hail the Groupon!
I was roped in by Groupon and received $16 for $8. I had the Mushroom Swiss burger, the breakfast egg & bacon and Maui milkshake (not all at the same time). 
Wouldn't have been worth $16, IMHO. The burger was tasty, and the egg in the breakfast sandwich was cooked real well.
The milkshake was so-so, but very rich & creamy. 
This location is open LATE......... or early depending on your age!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were walking along the strip when we overheard some guys talking about Fatburger. One of the guys mentioned a fried egg that they on your burger, so we were determined to try it at that moment! When we finally arrived at Fatburger, we were hesitant about entering cause it looked kinda shady, but we finally built up the courage. 

Their menu doesn't really offer much to choose from. The only unique option that they have is the fried egg. I had the medium burger with skinny fries. I opted out of the fried egg since it didn't seem appealing to me anymore. The burger wasn't bad, but it seemed like a poor In-N-Out imitation. The skinny fries were crispy even though we walked all the way back to our hotel room before gorging. Overall, it was decent and cheap. I'd definitely choose Fatburger over the McDonalds next door though."}
{"text":"What a ripoff they hand out coupons buy one get one 5 dollar beer and they don't honor them will never go there again"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE ! Unless you want to get taken for a fool.

Its been a couple days since we went there and I am STILL pissed.  

Food is great, a carb overload but very satisfying! 

Customer service... cashier... manager...  THEY DONT GAVE A DAM what you want... only what they can up sale you!  I went here and ordered a large combo with fries and a coke... for about 12 bucks... What I ended up paying was almost 18 bucks.

No I didn't notice how much until after I sat down and actually looked at my receipt ... yes dumb on my part but I was a little distracted with my drinking...  Any who I go up to the cashier and tell him that what I was charged was NOT what I ordered... This was before meal was prepared so I was sure it wouldn't be hard to correct... the cashier looked me right in the face and said I know that is not what you ordered but its better!

So the cashier  calls the manager over and HE tells me that he would not give me a refund that I was be happy with what I ordered. I argued that I didn't want double patty, too much food, just give me my money back ill go else where and he would not budge. He kept saying the burgers are so good that I would be grateful with the extra large meal, shake  ( it was good but I didn't need to mix shake with BEER gross plus I didn't order it). Needless to say I didn't want to start a scene since the MANAGER was the one telling the cashiers to pretty much rob us blind and I was drinking.. 

I just wanted to throw my pennies at that man and tell him he needed change more then I did... NEVER GOING BACK... 

Food however was great :("}
{"text":"OK, 
So you know how you go to a fast food joint and the burgers on the menu behind the counter are shown all nice and big and juicy, but when you order it, it turns out to be an overcooked, undersized, nothing remotely close to a sandwich even worthy of being called a reasonable facsimile thereof? Well, Fattburger has mastered this process...inversely. The picture on the menu did not even begin to do justice to the mammoth, gigantic, huge, swollen, bloated mass of beef served greasily to me between the two unfortunate slices of bun forced to bear the weight of this thing. To make matters worse (or better, depending on one's POV), I had an additional patty, avocado and bacon added to the behemoth. 

The ride back to the hotel was arduous. The aroma of the fried beast filled the car, beckoning to my hunger to stagger at the next red light and take a large bite from this beefy buffet. Wisdom prevailed, however, as I knew that once the beast was unleashed, it would go neither quietly nor cleanly back into its now saturated paper encasing. Must hurry. 
Barely, but successfully, I transported the package to my room, bag intact, where it was stripped down to its full, naked, delicious elegance. At last, we are alone, you and I. Come. 

With all my hunger, I was still not able to finish. \"Fatt\" does NOT accurately describe the girth of this burger. Try as I might, a happy plate (bag rather) was not to be. Stomach capacity exceeded. Digestion activated. Food coma eminent. Not to worry. With a refrigerator and microwave readily available, we shall meet again very soon. Abdominal pain setting in. Oh Lord, please let me make it thru the night. 

If you find yourself in Vegas, be sure to treat yourself to a Fattburger. I warn you, though. Do not underestimate this sandwich, for it is Fatter than its Fatt namesake. Also, I don't recommend more than one within a six month period. Your heart and grandkids will thank you. 

\"S\""}
{"text":"I was NOT impressed! Give me In N Out over this any day! Thank goodness I was dressed in costume and received 15% off my order. (Their doorway advertisement for Halloween week/weekend). My burger didn't look burnt but it sure tasted burnt. The amount of cheese was poor (1 slice) for $.99, and was pretty tasteless. The pickle/ relish combo I found to be rather ICK! and the fries tasted just like Burger Kings. I wanted Onion Rings, but they didn't have any. 

I am aware you can build it the way you wish, however being my first time there (and probably my last, I was that unimpressed) I felt I should try the sandwich as it should be. 

Sierra, the one employee, was the best thing in that whole place! She was GREAT! She brought our food and asked if we needed anything, we asked for Ketchup, which instead of just telling us where it was since it's a serve yourself, she went over and got it for us. She didn't need to do that. She went above and beyond her job just to make our experience more enjoyable. She had a smile on her face the whole time, which was nice compared to the rest of the employees. Give that girl a raise and promotion! 

Oh, and besides the 10 minute wait in line, because the employees (including the manager on duty) lack of knowledge of the 15% off deal; they clearly have advertised on a sign as you enter Fatburger was ridiculous! First they argued with us about the 15% off, until the employee asked the manager, who then gave us the stink eye, until she waddled her butt to the doorway. Then without any word walked to the back where the line continued to grow as we waited, and waited. She returned and completed the orders after calling her manager asking how to input the discount (probably waking the manager up, but good for them if they don't train their employees properly).

I will not be going back to this Fatburger that's for sure, and will probably not eat at another again. Was highly dissatisfied. 

No comparison with In N Out."}
{"text":"Sooo delicious. Nom nom nom. Comes in tiny to super large portions. Do you know how cute a tiny hamburger bun is? I do. It's adorable. This food was what I needed after drinking so much.

The guy at the counter was super fast and focused. Not something you see much these days. I'd say fair prices considering where you are. 

Beware of the bathrooms. 

Vegetarian burgers are an option."}
{"text":"Went to my first Fatburger and my last!
Food was way over priced for a burger and some grezzy fries was $13.50.
I could have done better staying at home and eating out of a can!"}
{"text":"Before the Peoria location opened, I'd never had a Fatburger, I think I saw the chain in other cities but had never eaten at one.  I ate at this one not long after it first opened, and I REALLY liked it.  It was one of the better fast burgers that I've had.  The fries were good, the place was clean, and I loved the number placard that they gave you to claim your meal with its music and burger trivia on it.

The placards went away, and apparently so did the initial quality and cleanliness.

I still like Fatburger burgers, but I don't know if I'll be returning to this location.  I no longer live in Phoenix, so I pretty much only get to Fatburger when I come to town, and always thought of this as a good place.  Well, sadly, it isn't that good of a place any more.  The burgers, in my opinion, still taste good.  But the place has suffered from neglect.  There were only two people working there when I went there a couple of nights ago, and they were out of BACON.  I gently chided the man on the register, how could a burger joint run out of bacon?  He said the manager didn't order enough.  And I guess it was impossible for a shift manager to take $40 out of the till and drive 3-5 miles to buy a bunch of bacon.  Pretty lame, IMO.

That's pretty trivial, but it is indicative of a problem.

There were other indicators.  First, the dining area hadn't been bussed.  Tables were dirty, and that is not good.  Second, the soda fountain had not been properly cleaned.  Several levers were sticky with syrup, and that level of stickiness takes some time to build up.  So proper cleaning procedure hadn't been followed for some time.  Third, again attesting to the dining room not being properly maintained, they were all but empty of the little cups that you load with ketchup for your fries.  They have two large bins for them and probably less than a dozen total available between the two.

To me, these indicate a total lack of concern from the owner/manager.  The franchise is not being properly supervised, procedures are not being followed, and that is a problem.

Let's talk about my meal.  My burger was cooked properly and done quickly.  There were two orders ahead of me and the woman at the grill seemed to be getting orders out speedily.  My cheddar cheese burger tasted good, even without the extra-crispy bacon that I wanted.  I've always liked the flavor of a Fatburger, it must be the meat and fat mix plus seasoning.  The fries, though hot, were a little under-done.  And the soda mix was not correct, I think too much soda water.  I did not get a refill, I nursed the one drink through my meal and got icewater when I left.  This is, after all, Phoenix summer.

I would give them three stars for food, if they'd had the bacon I might have given them four.

So why am I giving them two stars overall?

A couple at a table had a problem with their meal.  I don't know what, but the woman was talking about how she couldn't eat it.  Maybe the order was incorrect or they included something on her burger that she had a sensitivity to.  Regardless, the workers did not satisfy them, as a result the woman complained throughout their meal and said 'This is going up on Yelp as soon as I get home!'  Well, it hasn't yet, so she either calmed down and realized that she was perhaps overreacting or she just didn't get around to it.  But the workers did nothing to placate them.  Any small business, especially food, needs repeat business, and they lost those two customers that night.  Maybe the workers didn't have the authority to satisfy the people with a future comp'd meal, which would indicate that the owners/managers have a weak set of procedures in place that produced dissatisfaction.

I got the feeling that the place was under-staffed.  I never saw more than two people, and neither came in to the dining room to clean.  After the unhappy couple left without busing their table, that table sat uncleaned for over half an hour until I left.  But on top of that, they had very little business that evening.  I arrived around 7pm and stayed for an hour.  One person came in after that picking up an order to go, one family came in just as I was leaving.  That's not enough business to justify staying open.

Maybe it was a slow night.  Maybe they were shot-staffed that night.  Maybe management is on vacation.  Regardless, this location's owner and management need to take a serious look at how this site is operating, because otherwise, they're going to start losing money if they're not already.

For me, there are lots of places to get hamburgers, including Smashburger, The Habit, Steakenburger, Wineburger, etc.  There's lots of places to get good burgers, and all of those locations have better numbers than this Fatburger."}
{"text":"This place sucks !!!!  The service is so slow. You have to wait a good 20-30 for your food. Do not eat here. !!!"}
{"text":"This is the Fatbuger located inside Santa Fe Station. 

One of the floor manager told me to never eat here because she got food poisoning  once. You know why people get food poisoning here? Because this place is a motherf*cking outhouse that serves actual sh!t on a bun. 

They say that this place is open 24 hours. But, that's some bullsh!t. Every time I come here after 3 AM, the crackhead midget they hired always tells me: \"We be closed aight!\" in a very angry tone. All the lights and even the OPEN sign is still on but this loser just refuses to work.Last time I came here, the guy was once again at the register. Finally, this time he didn't tell me that Fatburger was closed. He then incoherently and almost inaudibly asks me: \"Mey I be teken ur ordur?\" I then tell him what I want and immediately notice that he is having a lot of difficulty typing in the order. He then starts inaudibly mumbling: \"He wans a cheezbruger.\" Eventually he begins to obviously look frustrated that he can't figure out how to use the cash register and get my order put into the computer. After about a minute, he quickly looks up at me and says: \"WE BE CLOSED!\" in that angry tone of voice again. I then ask him why he originally was taking my order and he replies: \"I wuz jus Playin..\" OMFG! This idiot has been just saying he was closed because he was too stupid to figure out how to use the cash register. I wonder what management will do when they find out he has been doing this? 

Do you see the sh!t I have to deal with when in NW Las Vegas?"}

{"text":"Taste like every burger. Nice employees, though the seating inside is a bit small. Prices are decent."}
{"text":"My experience at Fat burger was truly a experience. I visited this location and the cashier was so nice, however I couldn't understand why she was the only person working the register when 10 - 12 other employee's were standing around and just talking and having a great time. I found that to be really rude because my group had a lot of people and the ordering process might have went faster if another employee cam to the register. 

I ordered the turkey burger and steak fries. I was really please with the way the burger turned out. The turkey was not dried out or flavorless. However the young lady that dropped the burger off to the table had a massive amount of weave in her head. I am not knocking her for that but if your going to serve food I personally think you should have all of that hair in a bun to avoid it from touching my food. Overall the food was really good and the cashier was great but the other areas discussed needs lots of improvement."}

The only thing I suggest they do is get heartier buns that can hold up when topped with 16oz of juicy beef (half way thru the bun wasnt sloppy soaked but it was pretty weak) the beef had a great seasoning to it and the fries, which are my favorite kind steak fries (fat fries) were cooked perfectly. It was pretty empty in the building I dont see why but the joint was clean.

________________

Another hidden gem in the heart of Thornhill right beside Promenade Mall! If you're in the area and craving a burger, check this out. However, if you are closer to other notable burger joints, I wouldn't suggest a trek all the way here.

The burger itself (bun and patty) was pretty dry despite their brand's claim to have \"the biggest and juiciest burgers you'll ever taste.\" Let's just say I had pretty high expectations for a big and juicy burger until I took my first bite. The pro-tip here is to add as many toppings as you can to compensate for the dry burger. This isn't necessarily a bad thing to overload on toppings, but I also don't want to force myself to ask for more lettuce and tomatoes just to add moisture to my burger. I did enjoy the option to add an onion ring!

The price is comparable to other burger joints in this fast-casual space. There was once a Groupon, which I am upset I didn't snag. If it comes up and you are in the area, I think the deal is worth it for this place.

The service is the best part about this place! The staff are so friendly and attentive. They brought our food and drinks to the table and cleaned it right after we were done. Definitely a nice surprise for a fast casual place like this!"}
{"text":"Awful service. 

Ordered a large with cheese and a milkshake. The guy goes \" I'll take the shake out right away\". 

10 minutes goes by... the burger arrives and as the delivery person takes away the number in the stick thing I mention I still have a shake coming. Well She mumbled something took the stick and walked away... obviously not giving a shit. 

Another 10 minutes goes by and I finish the entire burger and don't you know it? I'm thirsty! I walk up to the counter and ask for the milkshake. Someone turns around and pulls it out of refrigerator and hands it to me? Really wtf? Did they assume I abandoned it after not searching for it's destination? And they weren't even that apologetic about it either. Oh and I should mention they weren't that busy... I'd be more sympathetic if they were being overrun by customers. 

Guess I'll grab a burger at Five guys next time and every time from now on."}

I hadn't eaten at Fatburger since the nineties, and now I remember why.  The burgers are grossly under-seasoned and do not taste good.  

In fact, I think Fatburger makes the worst burger I have ever had in my life.  

The fries were fine - nothing special.  

I ended up leaving my burger after just two bites.  I HATE wasting food, but I could not stomach it.

{"text":"I like them for having the option of a veggie burger that dosent taste like cardboard, I always get the curly fries with The garlic pepper seasoning. The one lady who usually works the counter is super friendly.  They have \"all day\" breakfast which is actually tons of food for the price. Toast, eggs, hashbrows Ang your choice of meat or pancakes for under $8"}
{"text":"Summary/TLDR - Wonderful service, $40 for 2 people (pricey), good burger but could use more flavor. It's a higher class Steak n Shake. Would visit again.

Stopped in because I heard this place was decent. Ordered a 1/3# breakfast burger (burger, egg, bacon, cheddar) and they had an advertisement for free fries with a purchase of a draft beer, so naturally, I jumped on this offer. We ended up getting charged for the fries, went back up, the cashier had recognized us and his mistake, apologized and admitted he got a bit flustered with the line that was forming behind us. The fact that he straight up admitted he made a mistake, without trying to dance around the issue, really made me appreciate the service here. So he called over the manager and they were going to refund us, which I know can be a pain, so I asked if we could get onion rings instead, and the manager (without hesitation) said yes. FANTASTIC SERVICE. The onion rings were brought right over.

I'm pretty picky when it comes to breakfast burgers. I can say this wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was better than some of the worst. The meat could've used more flavor, but regardless, a good burger!

It was a tad bit expensive though. For 2 breakfast burgers, 1 beer, and fries was $40..."}
