{"text":"Love the fresh smoothies. Elvis is a favorite as well as the blueberry granola. Great way to start your day with a boost added into your smoothie."}
{"text":"Watery and thin smoothies (Robek's is much better) PRE-MADE food and salads, not fresh like PANERA.  I wish it was better because I live very close to the store on Clifton Blvd."}
{"text":"When I moved from Cleveland to California last year, I assumed I would have no problem finding a casual restaurant with food as flavorful and fresh as Liquid Planet, but I haven't found a place that compares. I loved the pita sandwiches (my favorite was the Greek) and the salads are unbelievable. Liquid Planet offers substantial yet healthy food, friendly and prompt service, and a multitude of smoothie options."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go if you want a simple and uncomplicated meal. If you can't decide on lunch, the liquid planet is a safe and tasty choice.   I always get a smoothie with every meal. The hummus is great. You can't go wrong with any choice."}
{"text":"Very nasty food, taste like canned food and the customer service is terrible."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for small quantity and mediocre taste. This is ironic due to the fact that the advertising in the windows makes it look like a $ dollar store on W 65th somewhere. The addition of these make it impossible to people watch, which is what most people do while they are in there, as they were placed right at eye level when you're sitting in a booth.  The worst is the window advertisement right as you walk in....\"a better way to eat\".  It makes me feel like i'm being reprimanded for my usual eating habits. And the stock photo of the geriatric couple on the back wall stating that \"It's never too late\" to start eating healthy. I didn't realize Liquid Planet was such an expert on health and fitness.  The place looks like one of those stores where you can sell your gold and buy a pre-paid cell phone all in one stop.  I hope the Crocker Park management takes notice of this circus and forces the owner to tone it down....very bad taste!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch today!! The Greek Chicken Pita Wrap and Chicken Paprikash Rice Bowl are my FAVORITES!! Gotta go back to try a smoothie!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why but Elvis chill smoothie too much oily peanut butter! Big glob in bottom. Also Key lime smoothie bland!!..Can't afford throw away my money! Got an idea it was the prep guy...no idea!!!"}
{"text":"Love it!! Great service and food! My only complaint is they don't have a Nutritional menu at the store or online."}
{"text":"Fresh Smoothies! I am writing a review because i needed to pick up 4 smoothies on a Sunday evening. I first went to Robeks on a Sunday and they were closed and then i remembered Liquid Planet... I first called to see if they were open because i was in such a rush to pick up 4 smoothies to take to a friend in the hospital. As i explained she offered to make them for me so by the time i got there they were ready to go. I didn't know what flavors to get so she kindly made popular suggestions. When i arrived i was greeted right away and the smoothies were ready to go! It was just really so nice of a gesture and i appreciated the service. This happened a few months ago and i have been returning ever since! The mango berry smoothie is one of my favorites and my son enjoys the creamsicle. Not to mention the flat bread pizza's are also fresh and delicious. Now that it is warmer we will sit on your front patio next time! Thanks Liquid Planet :)"}
{"text":"This place has a really cool atmosphere, but the food just plain isn't good!  Good prices but a I think a lot of the food is just bland!"}
{"text":"Liquid Planet is a great smoothie shop and place to have a healthy, light meal. I went to the one in Crocker Park. There's another location on Clifton in Cleveland. Liquid Planet has a cool menu of smoothies. There are a lot of options. The menu for the food was really good too. They had a variety of rice bowls, stuffed pitas, and salads. I had a Greek chicken pita with a side of chips and salsa. The pita was awesome! Inside was chicken, cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, feta cheese, and cucumber dressing. I had it in a whole wheat pita. It just tasted really healthy and was full of flavor. The chips and salsa were good, but there were maybe 10 or 15 small chips with it. It was just a meager serving (for me anyways). Unfortunately, I didn't have a smoothie, although I did get to try a sip of the blueberries & cream and thought it was really good. Overall, if you're looking for a healthy snack or a light, healthy meal at Crocker Park, head over to Liquid Planet. You'll love it."}
{"text":"The smoothies are usually pretty good, but nearly every time I go in, I get treated like dirt by the people working there. Some of those young ladies should either adjust their attitudes or find a different line of work where they don't have to interact with the public."}
{"text":"I'm very tired of going in I'm very tired of going into place is getting bad service is overpriced is everything is anymore I'm just surprised that the service is so bad I'll give this place one more try but that's it"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Had a really good wrap and smoothie and was filled up for 10 bucks. Fresh, healthy, and had tons of flavor. Will be returning."}
{"text":"To Jennifer, The P.D. and  others  reviewing  the Liquid Planet on Clifton, it is in Cleveland - not Lakewood. Grr, I hate when people do this, like if its a cool place like Liquid Planet can't be in Cleveland?"}
{"text":"I love this place! i could never get tired of it they have so many selections, their salad was fresh. I like how everything is there in the open and they prepare your meal in front of you. VERY CLEAN. in my opinion.  I haven't been disappointed yet. The Berry smoothie is great! oh and the best part is they're open late so perfect for my schedule!"}
{"text":"(Oopps, I didn't go to this location...i went to the one in Crocker Park/Westlake) Yum...casual (you order, they make, order number is called), healthy, many choices... love it and will go back. ordered the hummus pita (came with choice of salsa/chips or rice). good portion..but more than enough room to then get a delicious smoothie! friend ordered italian pita (like a chick Parmesan which she said was good too) PB and J smoothie (minus the banana)...was enjoyable but a little too much on the jelly side. there was a strawberry and cherry at the bottom. YEAH for real fruit inside! not busy for a Sat. night either. also love the name of the restaurant, people think everything is liquid. ha"}
{"text":"The blue Hawaiian and the peanut butter walnut oatmeal smoothie is my crack. And the chicken broccoli pizza. Some of their smoothies have a weird after taste though. Also sometimes watery, but I imagine that depends on which employee is making them. They also never put walnuts on my smoothie like the menu says they do. Regardless still decently good. Doesn't compare to robeks tho."}
{"text":"Love the smoothies, but that new manager lady they have has got to go. She's so scatter brained and has no clue how to multitask.  I feel bad for the people that have to work with her. I would not be able to handle it. She stresses me out watching her work. So much so that if she is behind the counter I will come back later when she isn't working."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to stop in here and grab a smoothie and so I tagged along. I definitely wasted my money. I had the pita with hummus and veggies with a fruit smoothie. The sandwich was so tasteless that I honestly didn't even eat it. I am not a picky eater at all! Believe me! But I also believe there is no point in eating something if it doesn't bring a smile to your face. It tasted like chalk and the smoothie was nothing to rave about. Not going back either is my friend."}
{"text":"Liquid Planet is my go-to \"I need something to eat that's fresh and filling but I don't want to get the typically subshop sandwich'.   My personal favorite is the Mexican Pita and the Egg and Veggie Pita. I usually get them with a side of their fresh hummus and carrots. The atmosphere is very chill and laid back. It's the perfect place to catch up with a friend or study in the afternoon. Best of all, it's in walking distance to Edgewater Park so you can work out and then grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Best smoothie place in town!! Gotta love everything!!! It's totally amazing!! Try anything!!  #mindblown"}
{"text":"Food is trying to be healthy but the microwave chicken kind of a turnoff. Staff friendly enough. Not much food for the price. Menu all over the place. Sometimes to many items are a bad thing.   Smoothies -- it's no jumbo juice. Love Cali one. It's decent."}
{"text":"I used to come here ALL the time when I lived in Edgewater.  Loved this place!  WAY better than any other health/juice/smoothie place I've come across.  Unless you live in the area, it's not in a location that people would really go by... but if you ARE around Edgewater, definitely don't hesitate to try a fresh juice from here.  Wish there was one near my new apartment :*("}
{"text":"if i could, i'd eat every meal there. they have healthy and good food (i know, it sounds like an oxymoron, but here it's really not.)  the smoothies are pretty much a meal in themselves, but don't avoid their actual food offerings too- the have some great peanut butter sandwiches.  and the atmosphere is great- it's like the west coast visited clevo for a nanosecond and deposited liquid planet. a must for a clevelander who doesn't want to eat the staple meat and potatoes meal. i mean, they have chicken paprikash soup.  how cool is that?"}
{"text":"Loved it!  I wish we had one of these near my office.  So many healthy options!  I especially loved the long list of side options (never too many choices!) and the crazy flavor combos (cheese and peanut butter?) ."}
{"text":"Average. Seemingly healthy place to eat.....but if u look carefully their smoothies are laden with artificial ingredients and calories. We had hummus wrap and a Thai rice bowl (veg). The wrap tasted good. Portion was also good....they used the large pita. But the hummus was not fresh.  The rice bowl was OK. It was in good portion.... But few veggies. Also, the only \"Thai\" thing about it was a ladle of sweet/spicy sauce.  It could have been any sauce. When they say Thai, I expect some of those flavors...lemongrass, galangal, kefir lime leaves, coconut etc. The girls working there were friendly and professional. Service was quick. They have plenty of tables..... And the place was clean. I might go again if I m in the area but honestly, I would go to chipotle (also in crocker park) if I want healthier food with mostly organic ingredients."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite of the three Liquid Planets I've been to. It's pretty nice to not have to deal with the high-maintenance trips involving the Cedar road parking situation or the whole Crocker Park \"experience.\" Parking is a breeze. It's the smallest of all of the locations and I like it that way. The smaller size gives it more of a neighborhood appeal.  For the first time tonight, I tried the food. It was pretty good!I had the veg-out pita with provolone cheese. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the iceberg lettuce on it...but other than that, it was warm, toasty, and satisfying. I had the hummus and chips as my side (free with any meal).  Also, I really like the staff here. Very friendly and patient!  Definitely get the frequent-diner card, as mentioned in other reviews. I am already halfway to getting my five bucks off, and it was only my first time at the Clifton store!"}
{"text":"I've had a few smoothies and all of them have been good. The veggie pita was really good too, and I love that you can get hummus as a side. It's a little expensive for lunch, but the food is fresh and good."}
{"text":"Make sure you get a frequent diner card to punch if you plan on coming back. You just have to make a few purchases to get free stuff!   This is a locally owned store so make it one of your dining destinations when you go to Crocker Park.   The staff is pleasant. The smoothies are awesome.   I love the peaches n cream smoothie."}
{"text":"I always order the same things (a oatmeal smoothie or a hummus wrap) and the smoothie tastes different EVERY time. Maybe that has something to do with their ever rotating staff of teen girls.   Service isn't particularly fast as everything is made to order. If you happen to come in on the rare day when there's a line be prepared to wait awhile. Seems this place doesn't have regulars (looking at other reviews it's no mystery why) and people take forever ordering.  The best and worst part about this place is it has a lot of seating. The tables are spacious and there are even a few outdoors for when the weather is nice. BUT the indoor tables are set up parallel to the counter and the outdoor ones are set right next to the floor to ceiling windows. That means when eating inside you'll be the only entertainment for the bored staff (this place is rarely busy) and outside you'll have to pretend you're not sitting 3 inches from whoever is eating at the tables inside."}
{"text":"This place really impressed me.  What reeled me in was the fact they had more than smoothies.  They had a great selection of pitas and salads in addition to 45+ smoothies to choose from.  This place has it all over Jamba Juice so Ohio will never know what it's missing!  I ordered the Galaxy salad with Sesame Ginger dressing and it was delicious.  They serve it to you in a container with a lid so you can take the remainder of it home with you if you need to.  This place is squeaky clean and the store has fun colors.  I will definitely go back.  Too bad you are at the mercy of Crocker Park parking meter roulette in order to stop in here..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff when I visited. Food was fresh and prepared well. Would go again.   Clean."}
{"text":"Thai peanut rice bowl was full of flavor and a pretty good-sized portion. Good amount of chicken and really fresh veggies. I don't know why the smoothies are so expensive.  The peach I ordered was good, but not worth $4.  Also, there was a guy coming in and out of the place the entire time we were there.  He went outside to talk on his phone, then walked up to the window near our table, leaned on the glass and looked right at us, then turned around again.  Before that, he came in, sat right behind us for 5 minutes then went back outside.    Good times"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat and a smoothie, and rubberneck at the kids in the water park in the courtyard right outside.  I had the Greek Chicken Pita, and it was good. Dad had the Roast Beef and Horsey Sauce (really? horsey?) and thought it was a nice *snack*. The menu was HUGE and a bit overwhelming, but grab a paper menu from the counter so your eyes won't cross looking at the *wall of endless options*"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed coming to Liquid Planet. There is always something that caters to everyone's tastes and the food is always fresh. The salads are full of crisp veggies, the smoothies are packed with flavor and the pita pizzas are very satisfying. I have not tried the rice bowls but I assume they are just as delicious! If you're looking for a healthy and fast alternative for dinner, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I know I keep reviewing this place, but I swear it's for different locations! :) I really have a hard time finding something that I DON'T like at Liquid Planet. Yesterday I went in and ordered the Garden Fresh pita pizza but wanted to add grilled chicken. No problem they said! I also wanted their house salad without cheese and dressing on the side. Absolutely they said! Everything there is always super fresh, super filling and super delicious. You may wait a little longer than your average fast food joint, but I promise you it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow. 3 girls behind the counter chatting and moving as though there were NOT 5 customers waiting for their food. Also the servers should be a little more knowledgeable about the purpose of the special ingredients in the smoothies. For instance when you see a pregnant woman order the \"ladies only\" smoothie with donguai they should know enough to inform the customer that pregnant women should not drink that particular herb. Any way, the smoothies were ok, not worth the $5.99 price tag..."}
{"text":"Liquid planet should stay true to its name. The only thing they seem to have down is the smoothies. On the several different occasions I've tried to eat there, I've been remarkably underwhelmed and disappointed by the lack of flavor and quality of their dishes. The place has a great concept and wonderful smoothies but really needs to step it up in the meal department if they're truly looking to maintain their nutritious and delicious motif."}
{"text":"Yummy wraps and rice bowls and smothies!   This is one of my favorite local chains.. So tasty! I think it's just a hair pricier than it should be but I'm generally pleased with my meals here. Fairly healthy food, good portion sizes and a lot of good choices. Definitely vegetarian friendly and a good place for dinner. Never have to wait too long, either! I haven't tried their pizzas yet but they added those to the menu recently.. They sound great! Staff is also nice, too."}
{"text":"I'm always happy when I stop by for a delicious lunch at Liquid Planet.  I typically get the rosemary turkey but when I need warmed up I'll get a chicken paprikash bowl. Yum!  It's clean, quick and a convenient location although the parking lot can quickly become a trainwreck if there's a bad driver in the lot.  I love all of their fresh fruits and veggies.  Their smoothies are also delicious!"}
{"text":"Definitely geared towards the healthy minded, but keep in mind that the smoothies aren't really healthy (they're made with juice, which is loaded with sugar)  The pitas and rice bowls are are nice in concept and are delicious when executed right.  However, when I went there was no sauce with my Italian pita.  They gave me hot salsa on the side even though I didn't ask for sauce on the side?  I also got the chicken paparkish soup, which was sooo delicious, but soo badd for me.  I also got the mango berry smoothie: I found parts of the mango seed in my smoothie.  But I still love their smoothies. + the 5.00 discount cards are really good deals."}
{"text":"4 stars for healthiness. When we go out all we eat at are healthy restaurants. As far as health goes the wraps and salad options they have are the healthiest I have encountered in Ohio so far. We had a Livingsocial deal for here last week. Although the salad is not a 5 star salad (bagged lettuce) it was still good they are well priced."}
{"text":"This place wins for convenience.  Hours are great (opens early, closes late).  They're fast.  They've got a huge menu (probably too big, really).  And a pretty great location on Clifton.   I don't think their smoothies are anything to write home about.  Generally, I wish they had a thicker texture.  The Elvis-themed peanut butter and banana one is the best I've had so far.  Although the \"Classic\" is supposedly their most popular, I found it very blah.       Liquid Planet definitely markets itself as a \"healthy\" alternative, but I'm really wondering about the calorie count of the sandwich with three different kinds of cheese and peanut butter...do they think that's healthy because it's on pita bread and also has veggies?  And I'm not quite getting the \"healthy\" pizza they serve.  Because healthy pizza is actually an oxymoron.  Pizza, by definition, is not healthy -- and if I'm going to spurge on a pizza, I'm gonna go for a regular pizza.  Not one trying to be healthy.       But my 4-star review hinges on just four words, four words that instantly make my mouth water: THAI. PEANUT. RICE. BOWL.  Get it.  At first, you may think it's nothing special.  Just a bowl with rice, veggies, chicken, and a peanut sauce with a spicy kick, so what?  But after you finish it, you'll crave it.   You'll begin to worship it.  Soon, it will own you.      Also, something about the decor seems very late-90's.  Maybe their logo looks like the Backstreet Boys logo or something?  Oh, and do check out their bizarre wall art featuring people, of various ages, jumping and grinning.  I think they're all on Adderall."}
{"text":"I don't mean to be one of those negative reviewers but I have been getting chicken pitas here since I started dieting two years ago, so I can't speak for the smoothies or the other menu items.  I noticed since they got a new manager the pitas aren't as good. It seems like there's less everything. Less chicken , less condiment and what ever else goes on the pita. It seems like they are trying to phase out my favorite side also, apples and peanut butter. The new side is water logged celery and peanut butter. They still have apples for you but it isn't on the list anymore.  I enjoy the chicken pitas though but they just don't taste as good anymore."}
{"text":"It's a place that have very nice and healthy smoothies and healthy food.And you will be very healthy too .  Their smoothies doesn't add ice and sugar , they have lots of offer so you can change every time went you go there , the one I have and I don't remember  it's very tasty too!!   Hope they can open  one in LA too , next time went I visit Cleveland I will come back for their smoothies again !! =)"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for lunch. They have a huge selection of relatively healthy menu items and everything that I have tried has been tasty. Some items seem a little overpriced, but everything always seems fresh. The staff are always friendly.  My only recommendation is to get the sauce on the side if you get the rice bowl. The rice bowls are my favorite, but sometimes they can have too much sauce at the bottom."}
{"text":"I usually get the Venus salad. Its got a ton of fresh veggies topped with a healthy scoop of thick, flavorful, somewhat chunky hummus. I like smooth hummus, but I also love that the texture is thick and hearty here at liquid planet's. Its perfect for the top of a salad."}
{"text":"Love their smoothies. The PB açaí is my favorite. Their seasonal flavors are always good. Haven't had anything else because the smoothie menu is anyways tempting, but I don't feel guilty after having one. Prices are fair. Customer service is always great. The staff always greet you and they're pleasant when taking your order. Confirms the saying, \"Healthy people are happy people.\""}
{"text":"Love the menu ranging from specialty smoothies to salads and rice bowls.  Staff is super nice and cordial.  I wish there was a way for them to deliver to my hometown or even better open a location in Chicago.  We ordered a ginger rice bowl and a breakfast pitta with a hangover and açai smoothies. Delicious and so healthy."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed and think this place is heading down hill.   I've been here many times, but don't plan on going back after my last visit.  The staff seem like robots and very upset that they are working there and it ruins the vibe for me.    The main reason I'm not going back is they charged me $2 to add mayo and mustard on my ham and cheese pita??? I know this may seem petty, but seriously, WTF?  I should not have to pay an extra $2 bucks for a very skimpy sandwich that already costs me $7.  I asked her and she said thats what they charge, so I accepted it, but thats why they get the One Star review.     I'm sorry, but they lost my business from now on."}
{"text":"Seriously healthy food and smoothies!  THE UP-SIDE:  This place has so many types of healthy smoothies to offer that I can never decide which one want.  Each one is filled with natural ingredients and damn good for you.  In addition, their pita sandwiches are equally delicious!  THE DOWN-SIDE:  No real down side to this place!  THE SUM-IT-UP:  This place is the place to go when you need a quick, healthy, pick-me-up.  Yum."}
{"text":"I haven't ever had a smoothie, but have had salads, pita sandwiches, and soup. Their black bean soup is delicious. I haven't had anything that I haven't liked. It is pretty cheap and good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, good options, friendly staff, quick service & affordable! I eat here at least 1x week!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place - first time in Ohio and we ate lunch here while shopping at Crocker. I got the hummus toasted pita without cheese, side of apples and peanut butter, and a Gena's Fountain of Youth smoothie! So good, healthy, and vegan!"}
{"text":"I have been in this place in multiple occasions and the staff here is extremely rude an immature.  The last few times I have been here my order is wrong. I've overlooked this the past few times giving them the benefit of the doubt.  Today I had a simple order. Plain brown rice and chicken. The staff here manages to mess it up. When I brought it up to the manager he was extremely defensive and argued that his staff doesn't make mistakes...ya ok.  I don't recommend this place to anyone. They market themselves on being \"healthy\" but not one thing  is healthy on their menu."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place isn't always packed!? The service is always friendly and accommodating. I enjoy their freshly, quickly prepared wholesome foods! The menu is huge! Like 25' long huge! If you can't find something you like it's YOUR fault!!"}
{"text":"So I ordered a bacon egg and cheese pita thinking how this would be amazing, I love bacon egg and cheese. However when I got it there was only 1 strip of bacon! What's the point of buying bacon egg and cheese if there is only gonna be 1 strip of bacon!"}
{"text":"Yep, I'm a fan.  I come here often before performances, as sometimes solid food isn't the best before singing and dancing. My next smoothie is on the house, as I've filled up my bonus card!  They have an extensive menu, all of which can be boosted by their various boosts...I like flaxseed...lubes up those old joints of mine.  My favorite smoothie isn't on their menu...they have a bunch of under-the-counter smoothies that they can make...like the Banana Split. Add a flaxseed to this bad boy, and you're good to go.  The store is remarkably clean, as are the bathrooms. It has a front porch which is kick-ass for sitting out and chilling...and it's open late!  I've never had any of their food, and never will. I still can't understand why people would get food at a smoothie place...or a coffee place...but, to each their own.  I can't give it five, but I assure anyone coming here that it's a quality joint...Robeks and Jamba Juice can eat it.   Liquid Planet is the shiz."}
{"text":"Breakfast smoothie - Peanut Butter walnut with almond milk, it's a little extra but worth it for once in awhile. I bring my daughter here alot in the summertime for our Saturday smoothie. She likes the creamy classic. Rice bowls are ah-mazing! Get the rewards and they will send you $5 off your next order."}
{"text":"The quality is starting to get really bad. Every time I come now the lettuce is brown, the tomatoes have their cores still on them, or they give me just the skin ends of the tomato. The meat doesn't seem very fresh. Had the roast beef last night and it was gross. The last few pittas I've had have lacked a lot of flavor when in the past they were phenomenal. I really enjoy this place especially since there aren't many healthy options on this side of town. But the quality and freshness is starting to become a big issue. Also for a health food place, bringing in avocados might be a good option.. Smoothies are great though! I also wonder if there's some type of nutritional info on the menu items?"}
{"text":"A good local alternative to Jamba Juice that appears more funky (in a good way) than its competitor.  As always watch what you order if your counting calories as quite a few are well above 400 and higher. A yummy choice for some delicious hydration while you shop a little. ...and the food looks tasty as well."}
{"text":"I decided to give Liquid Planet a second attempt, after my first experience was not so pleasant. As we entered the facility the manager of the franchise stood at the register rummaging through receipts, stared at us for a few seconds, then responded with a rude, \"what do you want.\" I am somewhat of a picky eater, so ordering at a place of this sort is a little difficult. The first item I decided on got shut down due them being out of cream cheese. I asked the girl for a few opinions as to what to order because I haven't eaten here before. The girl responded with, \"I like them all.\" And that's all I got. After becoming frustrated by the lack of help, I finally decided on a tuna salad wrap, without lettuce or tomato. Once my wrap was given to me, it had lettuce and tomato on it, in which I replied I asked for no lettuce or tomato. The employee replied with a snarky, \"that's not what the order said.\" All in all, the service pretty much sucked and my 7 dollar tuna sandwich tasted like cardboard."}
{"text":"I've only stopped in here for a wheat grass shot. It's a large restaurant with an odd setup of tables, however, people seem to like it a lot. It seemed a bit messy when I visited. Not to be anal but they cut my orange wedge with a knife that had crumbs on it. How do I know? I had burnt crumbs on my orange wedge haha. Didn't bother me too much but it kind of leads me to wonder what else they may do :-/"}
{"text":"Their rice bowls are delicious and usually enough for two meals. The pitas are jammed full and really fresh. For being healthy, their food doesn't taste boring (unlike Tommy's on Coventry whose super \"healthy\" options taste like what my mom would describe as flavorless hippie food)."}
{"text":"Been to the fresh planet location in Avon, very good food and smoothies. Smoothies made by Vitamix, are to die for, the wraps are on toasted pita wraps, unique and very tasty. Liquid Planet and Fresh Planet are so good for those who want to and are changing some of there eating habits to good eats that are healthy. Definently a repeat customer from this guy."}
{"text":"Smoothies, sandwiches, rice bowls, Oh My!   Don't be fooled by the name, there's much more than liquids inside.  Liquid planet is the pinnacle of fast food.  Really nice staff.  Great food, super fresh and fast.  If you're looking for a great fast meal with some free wifi, this is the place to be.    Those rice bowls pack a lot of punch.  I thought a small smoothie and a thai peanut rice bowl would be a good idea.  I have given up on finishing the bowl and I think I'm going to have to roll myself out of here."}
{"text":"I love this place and just recently found out they have one in Cleveland Hts! I will definitely be going here more often now that I know.   I love the salads, smoothies, milkshakes and wraps. Ok I love everything except the calories that I seem to rack on as soon as I walk in!  The atmosphere is calm and they have free wifi which is always nice. The downside is that I never know what I want because they have so much to offer."}
{"text":"For a quick serve restaurant, Liquid Planet is healthier than most. I do appreciate that there are a few vegetarian options or that they offer to make any of their food vegetarian. My pizza was fresh and loaded with veggies (yay!).  However, the taste was just ok.  There wasn't enough cheese, the veggies felt more raw than cooked, and the sauce was bland.  The smoothie was tasty (orange, peach, mango) and had a nice citrus kick.  I did enjoy sitting outside and people watching.  I'm happy to go back if I'm at Crocker Park and in need of a quick healthy meal, but I don't think I'd seek this place out on its own."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and the Chili Thai rice bowl is very tasty. I got an Orange Creamsicle smoothie and it was great."}
{"text":"Good food, amazing smoothies. Food and drinks leave you feeling energized after eating, not like you need a nap like a lot of other places. Large menu. Awesome location - off Clifton Blvd with parking in the back. Ample seating inside."}
{"text":"For the health-minded citizens of Ohio, Liquid Planet will be sure to satisfy your needs. Smoothies of all kinds + boosts, pitas, salads, rice bowls at reasonable prices are what you'll find.  We only sampled the pita sandwiches and a smoothie and enjoyed all. I had the Greek chicken pita which I feel was a good choice. The sides are somewhat meager (chips/salsa or hummus, apples/pb) but tasty nonetheless.  Liquid Planet is good for a quick and light meal if you're not interested in some of the other sit-down places in Crocker Park."}
{"text":"Good food, yes. Price is ridiculous, however. $7.50+ for a piece of pita wrapped around a little lunch meat and lettuce is outrageous. I asked for mayo on mine, (came with mustard, but I asked them to add \"a little mayo\" as well) and the \"additional dressing\" would have cost me an extra $0.75 if I didn't catch them before they put it on. I left there feeling very ripped off. :("}
{"text":"What negative could you have about liquid planet?  The only one I can think of is too many decisions!    I've only ever had smoothies, never tried any of the food items they serve, because in honesty the smoothie is a meal all on it's own.  The two locations are great as well, either on Clifton where you can people watch or in Crocker Park.    I"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place, super extensive menu and really friendly service.  I've had the Chicken Teriyaki bowl so far.  It was delicious, fresh real chicken breast and fresh veggies cut and cooked individually and it doesn't seem to present any frozen veggies at all.  I recommend going for sure and be sure to try the smoothies, my wife loves them and she's extremely picky when it comes to fruit and yogurt blended drinks."}
{"text":"Love smoothies!!  Friendly staff, parking, clean place.  Would be five stars if you could order by the gallon-kinda like Starbucks has the to-go's that serve multiple people.  Had four different kinds so far, and even though the \"Hangover\" was an odd brown color, they were all great.  Support healthy eating!!!"}
{"text":"Fast food - the way nature intended!  Make sure you grab a preferred customer card, and call ahead for large orders. The parking is in the back."}
{"text":"amazing smoothies... I love love love their rice bowls... especially the chili thai. It's always a task making up my mind about which smoothie to try... there's sooo many to chose from. I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pleasant, casual atmosphere with cleanly presented food, is what we got when we stopped here one late night looking for more than a shared Subway sandwich or downtown pub grub.   We both had a hankering for a smoothie, so naturally, it was Yelp to the rescue. The first thing we noticed as we entered was this MASSIVE menu board the size of a medium sized bedroom wall. Once I had a quick skim though, it became clear that thankfully, the menu wasn't necessarily confusing. They may be generally categorised into: smoothies, pitas, salads, and rice bowls.  Between the two of us, we had: Classic and Workout smoothies, Grilled Cheese pita with black beans and rice, and veggie and cheese breakfast pita. Total came to just over $20. Everything was tasty and we left completely stuffed.  The only grievance is, they said they had to charge $0.75 extra for a few bits of onion.  Other than that, we'd definitely go back for the good food."}
{"text":"Liquid Planet makes healthy eating easy. From the pitas to the rice bowls (shoutout to pad thai), the fare is nutritious and tasty fast food.   But my fave part is the smoothie selection. My favorite is the blues factor.   Be sure to sign up for rewards and keep an eye on their FB page for promos :)"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of their Saturn salad (smoky chicken salad on top of leafy greens and tasty vegetables), and just about every smoothie I've had off the menu. They're fast, fresh and when I feel like I just haven't been getting enough fruits and vegetables in my diet, Liquid Planet is my favorite go-to for lunch. It's light but filling."}
{"text":"For the different types of options they have, I'll give them two stars, but Robeks is so much better.  The location is kind of inconvenient, plus they are pricey for a smoothie shop place. Nothing really excited me about Liquid Planet. Kind of blah. If you really want a good smoothie try Robeks, its $5 for a large smoothie and I promise you won't be disappointed (plus they are healthy!)"}
{"text":"Great smoothies for great prices. Around $3 for a small I believe (which is a good size). I have gotten both the egg and cheese pita, and the Elvis pita which has peanut butter, banana, and honey. Both were delicious! My boyfriend got a teriyaki rice bowl which tasted good as well. I like to come in here and grab a smoothie every time I come to Crocker Park, they are so tasty with a wide selection of options and flavors!"}
{"text":"What a fun environment, the staff was so friendly and quick to make my food and smoothie. Everything was fresh and tasty..I can't wait to try more smoothies. I wish cleveland area had more locations!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this a 2 bc I have very high expectations when it comes to acai bowls. And there's was horrible! I asked for strawberries and pineapple on top, they added it but it was FROZEN!   And then the \"granola\" could have been some kind of cheap cereal. It was very disappointing to say the least.   BUT their pitas looked amazing so I will give them another try."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab a quick lunch for work, I got the Mars salad. The salad itself was good, needed more dressing. The pita that it apparently comes with was stale when I bit into it, so I checked and there were several spots of mold. I spit it out and couldn't finish the rest of my meal.   It's a shame but I feel like I can't go back now, even though the location is convenient to my house and a healthy option for a quick meal."}
{"text":"This is my go to stop while I Uber in Lakewood.  I always ask Maria to put me together a smoothie based on how I feel.  She is 5 for 5 and making some pretty DOPE smoothies.  Good service and very knowledgeable staff is why I stay going to that Liquid planet...if you ever stop ask for Maria and she will put you together!"}
{"text":"I usually am a huge fan of this place but the teenagers they have working there now are totally rude and have no concept of customer service. They made my smoothie incorrectly today (I always get the same one. It's always green and today it came out red.) and they were so argumentative about it. Wouldn't do anything to fix it. If these dismissive kids are working, better be happy with whatever you end up with."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mick's Mixed Berry smoothie and it was delicious! Not impressed with the price for the size of the drink. Besides that, the inside is very spacious and it is typically pretty slow so not much of a wait (unless the younger staff is working because they like to chit chat more than attend to their guests). There are a few street spots, but if you can't get one of those there is a free parking garage nearby."}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time this past Saturday. I LOVE this place. The selection of smoothies and the healthy food choices are awesome. However I can't give it 5 stars because the girls working the counter were not friendly. At all... I will be back to try more food though."}
{"text":"Great healthy rice bowls, smoothies, salads and more. I like the smoothies as you can add a supplemental energy boost that helps with energy, immunity, recovery and more."}
{"text":"I'm baffled by the glowing reviews on this page. My experience with this place was that menu prices did not match what rang up on the register, the quality of ingredients was not justified by the expense involved, and they use a lot of processed ingredients. Iceburg lettuce. Very cheap, commercial tortilla chips with processed salsa, sauces on their pitas that came from a bottle. The celery that came with the very sickly sweet processed peanut butter as a side was not fresh looking at all. 4 kids meals - including two \"pizzas\" that were just whole wheat tortillas with melted cheese on top, two kid sized smoothies (that were supposed to be 'oreo' flavor, but my kids said they tasted more like a funny chocolate and banana), a chicken pita and glasses of water cost us $41 for lunch. It was not good at all. I was also confused by the sign outside which said 'Liquid Planet', and all of the inside signage that bore the name \"Fresh Planet\" - maybe they've changed owners, and that explains the difference in my experience vs. others posting here?"}
{"text":"Best smoothies. No ice!  Natural ingredients. Great food too. This place NEEDS TO OPEN IN BRECKSVILLE. there is an open storefront on Mill road near schools. It would be a cash cow. Kids walk out of school past this plaza to coffee and frozen yogurt. If this opens, it would be guaranteed business. Such good food would be a huge hit!!!!"}
{"text":"Whats not to like?  Easy to find location.  Somewhat healthy and relatively inexpensive food.  We all know white folks love smoovies...they have smoovies.  Its all stuff you could make at home but its good in a pinch.  Mainly, I like coming to these \"healthier\" places (Tommys, Roebeks, etc.) is the weirdos I see in here.  For people who care about what they put in their bodies they all seem socailly akward and completely miserable most of the time.  Shit cracks me up.  At least people drunk in a corner bar eating chicken fingers at noon, on a Tuesday, have a smile on their faces.  Ill eat a hummus wrap here so I dont feel so damn self concious when I take 2 bottles of Ripple to the head and chase people around like Fred chased Lamont!"}
{"text":"Skip it i went there to get a smoothie and the girls working there ignored me for 5 minutes, and when I finally got it it was watery and flavorless, i don't think I'd be back there any soon"}
{"text":"I love when the owner is there working the register and making smoothies. If in the very rare occasion that one ingredient has run out, he knows a perfect substitution to suggest. Food is good and refreshing"}
{"text":"Nice healthy lunch option near my work.  Smoothies are very good and so are the rice bowls.  When I'm in the mood for a sandwich- I get The Sunny!  The workers are usually very friendly and helpful.  I would give them a 4 Star rating if they had the nutritional information available for the menu items."}
{"text":"Sometimes health food stores sell you these boost things that they put in your drinks that are supposed to perform some magic like give you energy, cure a hangover or wash away your sins. Maybe they do in fact accomplish those things, but I'm not buying them because they transform an otherwise delicious smoothie into shit. So as long as you avoid getting one of those boosts in your smoothie, you cant really go too wrong here. Keep in mind that the food is generally considered health food, so if you are accustomed to WacArnolds or McDowells type food, be aware that your food won't come soaked in grease or butter.  For a while I was going pretty often to this location. I would walk there and order my food to go. Unfortunately I had to stop going for a while because I had a few conversations with one of the girls who worked there about video games while she made my food. When she mentioned something about it to me one night while I was there with my girlfriend, I ended up getting screamed at the whole way home. From that point on I had to go to LIquid Planet in secret to get one of their Black Bean & Rice Bowls."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for a quick, healthy lunch. My go-to is the greek pita, and I also love the Elvis smoothie. The staff is super friendly, and the restaurant is clean. They have a pretty awesome rewards program, too. Not one of those programs where you need to carry a pesky card. You just sign up with your cell phone number, and they keep track of everything else. I am enough of a regular that I earn free lunches here and there. Try it if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"I love this place...GREAT Smoothies, Wheat Grass Shots, Awesome Salads...All Healthy!! I suggest getting the order 'to go' and taking it to the beach!!"}
{"text":"Got the Turkey Reuben Pita, which was heavily loaded with coleslaw and the restaurant had no napkins."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this service no stars. When I order a pizza to be delivered to my job, I don't expect to receive it looking like it was just thrown into a box. For being as pricey as you are, I shouldn't have to put my pizza back together"}
{"text":"Great place to eat healthy love the chicken paprikash rice bowl and smoothies esp the just for men drink"}
{"text":"Pitas are bomb, tomato soup is yummy, smoothies are tasty.  Chips and salsa is like pace or something generic crappy.  Rice bowl was blah.  You can order ahead which is nice, line can move slow if busy"}
{"text":"The band director of my high school opened this place on Clifton in Cleveland a few years back.  This Westlake location opened more recently.  And I'd have to say I am a loyal fan of Liquid Planet.  Most places in Crocker Park are pricey and aimed at the \"meat and potatoes\" crowd.  L.P. provides a nice contrast, with a selection of fast, light, and healthy foods in a to-go atmosphere (although there are plenty of places to sit down).    The food is good.  I'm a particularly big fan of the rice bowls (Peanut Thai and Vegetarian Black Bean) and the Stuffed Toasted Pitas (Nutty or Ham and Swiss).  They also have a wide range of salads with all sorts of toppings including fresh fruit and nuts, and soups of the day.  That being said, I'm not a huge fan of their smoothies.  They all tasted somewhat similar, and many of the boosts give them a chalky, vitamin taste.  Although, to be fair, I haven't tried an overabundance of them (and there is a large selection to choose from!).  Their fresh juices are very good.  The price, although cheap, isn't necessarily great.  Portion to dollar ratio, I'd have to say you could find cheaper, but overall, not bad considering the freshness of the ingredients.  There are limited parking places out front on the street, but a garage is located only a stone's throw away, so no worries!"}
{"text":"I feel like it's so hard to find places that offer fresh and natural ingredients when you want to get something quick and on the go, and Liquid Planet makes me feel like I'm able to do it! If you are looking for a smoothie, they have 30+ options, and even dessert smoothies if you have a sweet tooth craving to fulfill. If you are looking for a normal meal, they have salads, pitas for days and awesome rice bowls. I love everything! You might wait 5 minutes or so for your order so still pretty quick, and a much better option than a sandwich/sub shop. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Go here! Liquid Planet is such a great alternative to fast food. I have been here multiple times and I have never been disappointed. My favorite pita/wrap is the Clevelander... the name should tell you it is amazing :) The rice bowls are also very good. They are the perfect amount for a light dinner. Since I love everything pumpkin, I tried the pumpkin pie smoothie last time I was in, and it was fantastic!! It tasted just like the real thing.   The service at this location is always great. The food is ready in a timely fashion and everyone who works there is always super nice!! Next time you get the chance, go to Liquid Planet for a yummy treat!"}
{"text":"My first and last visit here was probably 6 months ago, but I still remember how the little jackass teeny-boppers almost made me punch somebody in the face. They were douchey a-holes who are exclusively the reason I won't come to this particular LP even though it's a 5-minute walk from my house.   Take note, ownership: there are unemployed quality people out there who have a better idea about customer service than your current staff."}
{"text":"Very good for a quick bite. Friendly and helpful team. Colors and brand totally not helpful: that have fresh ingredients, but from outside just looks like a place for smoothies."}
{"text":"It's not that healthy. The rice bowls are 75 percent rice and some shredded carrots and chicken. Overpriced for what it is... Too bad"}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey but my family loves it here. My son raves about the pineapple creamsicle smoothie and I have tried both the orange creamsicle and oreo smoothie.  The ingredients are very fresh, creamy and just delicious.  Making a stop here when we are in the area just may become a tradition."}
{"text":"Always great food and genuine, good service. I've never had anything here that I didn't love. Everything is healthy and delicious!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I stopped here for a smoothie and were greeted with a friendly smile at the door. We ordered the green genie and the energy smoothie. I asked if they had anything other than soy, he said he was trying to get the big shots to offer an alternative. That's my only complaint. Although the soy milk is organic, i'd really love a nice almond milk. Listen to your employees!"}
{"text":"The thing about restaurants with multiple locations usually is that they're all the same. You go to the Starbucks by your house, you've been to them all... However, I've noticed a HUGE discrepancy in quality between this Liquid Planet and the Lakewood location....  The last couple salads I ordered here were all iceberg lettuce (which has the nutritional equivalent of styrofoam) with a couple piddly toppings; whereas the salads I fell in love with at the Clifton location were vibrant mixed greens and veggies...   I ordered an acai bowl last time... Super delicious, but again - what's with the cheaping out on toppings? No joke, it was a giant bowl of acai smoothie with seriously 6 banana slices and maybe a tablespoon of granola. It was basically acai soup.   I hate to say it, but the servers don't seem as friendly here either, like they can't be bothered to put your order together...  I love Liquid Planet, but I definitely will stick to the Clifton location from now on!"}
{"text":"The pitas are great. There are probably 30 smoothie flavors available at a decent price. The best one is called Elvis something. It is skim or soy milk, fat free yogurt, honey, peanut butter and bananas. The staff is always friendly and able to recommend a good dinner decision."}
{"text":"Took an ex pat friend to Crocker to \"do something\". Thought I'd show him one of the few things keeping the so called Cleveland lovers in town(temporarily anyway). He was actually quite impressed and said they didn't have anything like it in Omaha yet. Wait two months, they will. We took in the blandness that is the Apple store, then followed it up with one of the blandest lunches I've ever had. I ordered the six dollar Philly chicken pita and a Blues Factor smoothie(think Black Keys meets X Factor to fully grasp the mediocrity). Smoothie was okay. I don't even know why I ordered one as I detest smoothies. I think I am brainwashed to want one whenever I hear blenders. The only thing Philly about my sandwich was that it had the flavor profile of the crack in the Liberty Bell(which when you think of the seasoning it's likely accrued over years of sweaty tourists hovering over it, probably tastes better). Little cheese and onions and some kind of RANCH? No thanks. I've had better Wendy's. And the heaping helping of a dixie cup of cole slaw was an added insult.  The space is very bright with nice views of all the foot traffic. Staff is pleasant too. Would I go back? I'm thinking no. Maybe the one on Clifton if I'm for some reason jogging with Dr. Oz and he wants to buy. Plenty of better food options at Crocker. Shit, get a loaf of bread and some salami at Trader Joes and make sandwiches for everyone outside of Chico's and you'd be more fulfilled than going to Soggy Planet."}
{"text":"I had my partner get me pineapple smoothies there on several occasions when I was sick a couple of months ago.  They were awesome.  I would recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Wonderful smoothies and food. We always make this a pit stop on our walks in the neighborhood and then also when we are at Crocker Park.    The staff at both especially the one in Lakewood is great.  Definitely need to check this out.  It's healthy and very very tasty, there is not a bad thing i could say about this place."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since it has been born, I enjoy the theme of health conscious eating, wheat grass shots, boosters to your smoothies, etc... As of late, it seems to be taking a turn for the worse, customer care quality as well as food quality have drastically decreased. I remember the golden era of this establishment, I would usually see some sort of upper management around, even if only for a bit. I haven't seen that lately and it shows.  Its like when my buddies neighbor and acquaintance from school worked at the now vacant lot where Manor Park Sunoco once stood, Mike H we will call him used to work. Everyone knew this was a hangout place to pick up free snacks and much more. One day we were having a party at a friends house, it was a natty-fest, we fill the tub with only natural light and ice, then drink it. Anyways, any good party has of course beer, it also has to have party snacks. Given the statute of limitations, I am free to say we took just about all of the inventory for a month that place had to offer and poor Mike never even made it to the party.   Back to the matter at hand, this place is always staffed with young adults, who don't care about the well-being of the business, just a paycheck for some weekend entertainment. Im not one to stereotype, but for the most part this seems to be true in this situation and it shows in my purchases. I went in last night on my way to the house, starving, was not greeted warmly at all. Im not soft, so this was no biggie, on my way home I taste my smoothie which was supposed to be Orange Creamsicle and tasted like straight unripened orange. My bbq roast beef wrap was soaked in bbq sauce, it gave me an upset stomach after I ate it. Sad as it is to say, I may not return to this place ever again. Its not like they have cheap prices either, but I stayed a customer because the product was on point, not so anymore. I guess this is farewell LP. Deuces!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite and some warmth after shopping in the snow. We decided to order a few things to share, including a soup du jour and a large salad. All the ingredients were really fresh, and it came with a few slices of pita bread. YUM! We had a chopped salad with deli sliced ham and strips of crunchy bacon, we topped it with a honey mustard dressing and it hit the spot. We were ready to go back out in the cold, and finish up our after Christmas sale shopping spree."}
{"text":"First time there and left a sour taste in my mouth. Customer service was horrible. I made the point to the lady that it was my first time. And all she did was point to a sign didn't care to walk me through add one or any thing. Ordered a classic. The guy just handed the smoothie to me and did say thank you or give any kind of farewell/come again. So I probably won't go again.   Smoothie tastes good though."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while but decided to stop by yesterday for their free smoothie day. Not only were you able to get a small smoothie for free, you were also able to replace skim milk for almond/soy milk in your drink and add a spirulina boost. I ordered the blues factor smoothie with the spirulina boost and enjoyed it. It wasn't too sweet or too sour and had a strong banana taste.  Their menu is huge for a smoothie shop and consists of healthy options such as salads, pitas, rice bowls and more. I have tried the chicken paprikash rice bowl before and it is filling and delectable. I would have gotten food this time too if I hadn't already eaten.  Liquid Planet is a great stop for lunch, dinner or just because. They have delicious smoothies and food as well as friendly service, what more could you want!"}
{"text":"I'm not really part of the fruit smoothie generation of teens & 20-somethings, but I was attracted to this eaterie by their \"light\" menu of all kinds of sandwiches made in pita pockets! Definitely seems freshness is the key here. Soups, juices and smoothie ingredients are evident everywhere.  I ordered the roast beef with horseradish sauce pita pocket... It took a little while to be served, but it was VERY tasty. Toasted pita with plenty of roast beef slices (not rare), lots of fresh Romaine lettuce, asiago cheese, tomato -- and horseradish!!!  The horseradish sauce was SPICY -- just like I like it!! My eyes watering & sinuses draining with every bite!! ha ha ..  It was perfect!!  The prices were kind of steep for the quantity. Orders are placed at the counter, and when dining in - your number is called for you to pick up the tray of food and seat yourself. The order takers were knowledgable and friendly. I would definitely return to try some of their other spicy pitas."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is healthy and flavorful with good portion sizes.   I've been to the Crocker Park and Avon (Fresh Planet) locations a number of times and have never been disappointed.  I'm a big fan of the rice bowls. They come in a nice, reusable container and they load it up with brown rice! I usually get the chicken paprikash bowl, but I just had the Thai Peanut and it was delicious!  I also had the Rosemary Chicken pizza and it was excellent...lightly topped with not too much cheese.    They have a huge selection of freshly made smoothies, pitas, and salads too! The high school girls working there are very polite and accommodating.    Check Groupon for deals!  Here's to good health in 2014!"}
