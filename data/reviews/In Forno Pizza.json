{"text":"Best wood fire pizza around but plan for one pizza per person. Price point is high but the fresh ingredients and unique wood fire baking makes it worth it! Margarita pizza is our family favorite with whole basil leaves on it!"}
{"text":"Delicious, flavorful pizza and I love how the crust is thin, but doesn't flop over. Super cozy and cute with Christmas lights/music and really friendly staff. Just go :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday with my family and could not have been more pleased. Service was exceptional, wine was tasty and fairly priced, and pizza was absolutely delicious. Would highly recommend the Four Seasons pizza and the iced espresso. 5 stars all around. This place is the MOTHER JEANS!!"}
{"text":"George and his family are making the best pizza, by far, in the Cleveland area. It brings me back to my time on the coast of the Mediterranean. I highly recommend anybody who enjoys good pizza, to make this their next pizza stop."}
{"text":"Pepperoni Pizza was delicious. We also had the antipasto appetizer was also really good. Our service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is some of the best pizza in Northeast Ohio. People go on about Citizen Pie, in Cleveland, constantly. Though this is the same style I find it to be superior. The people are nice, the toppings are fresh, the pizza is served quickly, and you can now get beer and wine there. I can't see why you would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Ohio the food was really good you can't get good food like this in Ohio I highly recommend this place very good service it's high quality food"}
{"text":"Delicious! My go-to pizza anywhere is the Margarita, here it's amazing! I come here every once in a while because it is a bit on the expensive side for pizza, but I think it's worth going there occasionally. The pizza here is like no other in Avon. They have a large wood fired oven for the pizzas and only take about 2 minutes. Wonderful people working there, too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. Delicious pizza. Scrupulously good pizza. Salad was fantastic too. I will definitely be back. Went here on a friend's recommendation."}
{"text":"Pro s : freshness ; crust ; authentic         Cons; crust undercooked on bottom.  Small sleek seating area . Limited toppings choices  - \" authentic\". I think we were looking for a more traditional American pizza place. Don't expect usual type choices /prices in salads either."}
{"text":"Went here with a group to celebrate a birthday. It was my first time, and I have to say, I'm now hooked. Amazingly authentic Italian pizza, great service, and atmosphere. BYOB so make sure to bring a bottle of your favorite Italian wine ;) The family that owns the restaurant is adorable and extremely sweet. My 20 month year old son loved their pizza as well!  They had a high tech high chair and a sippy cup that he couldn't get enough of. Thank you! We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed my first time here! My husband and I got a gift certificate for Christmas for In Forno and we finally visited last week.  The place is small but so clean and nicely decorated. The bathroom had an actual baby changing table, baby wipes and feminine products, which I found to be very thoughtful. The owner and server were very kind - as my husband and I walked passed him to use the restroom, he stood up from his seat each time as we passed - very respectful. I've never had that type of treatment at a restaurant before.   We started with the caprese salad and everything was so incredibly fresh. We both got our own pizzas - perfectly made with the right amount of ingredients! My husband said it's the closest he's ever had to the pizza he gets when he goes to Italy. We finished with dessert - gelato for him and tiramisu for me - also incredible. My tiramisu had chocolate covered espresso beans on it, which were a nice finishing touch. The prices are very consistent with similar restaurants in the area - not too expensive. Definitely worth every penny.   A really lovely experience and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  We had both white and red sauce pizzas. The tiramisu was an amazing finish to the meal."}
{"text":"Whoa, This place is legit!! By far the best pizza I've had in Ohio. In one word I would describe In forno pizza as PERFECT! On top of that the owners make you feel very welcome and truly take the customer experience to the next level."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I have had in the Cleveland area. Inforno is authentic and family-owned, something that is hard to come by with the excess of chain pizza places in this area. We ordered the pepperoni and the di parma, and I would highly recommend trying either one. The gelato is great as well. I will definitely make it a point to go back. Local joints such as Inforno are rare and rely on word of mouth to succeed, so if you decide to have your next slice there, tell your friends!"}
{"text":"Yes, Yes, Yes! What a find. I walked in and the place is spotlessly clean. I was immediately greeted and seated. I was there for a late lunch and chose the caprese salad and the antipasto plate, both turned out to be excellent choices. The caprese had rich warm flavors, soft not biting, with the perfect blend of olive oil and balsamic reduction. The antipasto plate surprised me with its fantastic fresh choices, I particularly liked the prosciutto and the cheese. As I sat there I watched them make the wood fired pizzas and have already picked out my next order: the four season and the pepperoni. They seemed to do a brisk take out business too. I highly recommend In Forno, delicious food served by nice people in a clean environment."}
{"text":"In Forno's the best Neopolitan Pizza we have on the Westside - but it still has some ways to go to be completely right.  The dough is definitely good and the crust has a good char and chew.  The sauce though is too sour - I'm not sure they are using San Marzano tomatoes. And the cheese for the Margherita is not rich enough tasting.   Citizen Pie and Vero on the East side and Biga in Kirtland are making a more authentic Neopolitan. Citizen Pie is one of the best we've had - even compared to restaurants outside of Cleveland. It would be be good if In Forno could get close to theirs.   The salads however were great. Incredibly fresh and dressed just right.   I wish In Forno the best and hope that they continue to improve their product. It would be good not to have to drive to the East Side for Neopolitan pizza."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian pizza place. Picked up an order of 10 pizzas for a huge family gathering and it was a hit. Family run and friendly service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great Neopolitian style pizza...owner, George, was welcoming and warm.  Pizza was delicious with wonderful crust and quality ingredients. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"You won't find a better authentic Napolitano pizza in Cleveland.   Tired their limoncello desert as well, amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place does pizza right. Great flavors. Ready in 5 minutes! I travel to New Jersey and New York regularly on business and the In Forno pizza rivals the best NY style pizza I've had during my travels. White and red pies make your mouth water!! Seriously great pies and such a nice change from chain pizza. Well done In Forno. Finally a great family pizza joint with amazing service.!"}
{"text":"Simply the best,   Pizza was cooked to perfection in under two minutes, staff is super friendly and make you feel welcome, overall very clean and professional when it comes to work space. the interior design is modern and classy and the oven is in the open so you're able to watch your pizza cook which is neat."}
{"text":"Ordered a Margarita and an In Forno pizza both were wonderful. The crust was perfect and all the ingredients were very fresh. Enjoyed watching our pizzas cooked in the brick oven. The service was very good and friendly. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very fresh. George (owner) takes pride in his ingredients and understands the science behind good dough. If the pizza is not right, it doesn't go in the wood fired oven."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for delicious authentic tasting Neapolitan pizza. In Forno is doing it right. Fantastic crust and fresh toppings. Next time you're in the area, make this place a priority!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  We were in town and saw the great reviews, so we thought we'd try it.  SO glad we did!  The salad was the freshest salad I've ever had and the pizza was to die for!  We were in Italy a year ago and felt like we were right back there.  My husband even requested they open one in Michigan!  You must try!"}
{"text":"Great food, superb service.  Warm, inviting, casual atmosphere with the nicest poeple.  The red sauce is perfect.  My only regret is we didn't order more!  Excellentin every way!"}
{"text":"We spent over $50 on pizza and two sodas. Not impressed with the sauce. It had no flavor. We got there around 5:30 and waited an hour for our pizzas. Clearly delivery orders were a priority. Service was slow. No one came to tell us when we should expect dinner to arrive. While we appreciate family owned and local businesses, we hope the restaurant will look into these easily fixable items. Will not return to this place."}
{"text":"We used to stop and have In Forno Pizza when they would have their oven set up outside the Old Wine Cellar in Olmsted Falls.  Stopped in the restaurant today because we were in Avon Lake and the pizza is as good as we remembered, maybe better because of the ambiance and the ability to sit and talk with the owners.  Authentic Italian pizza (not your typical chain driven pizza) with fresh and local ingredients hand made by the owner while your talking to him from your seat at the counter.  The pizza is in front of you by the time your drink arrives and it is absolutely the best pizza I have ever had.  Can't wait to go back again soon.  George and Elizabeth are the nicest people you will ever meet.  George will describe every step of the process down to where he buys the mushrooms from a local farmer.  You can see the Goodman's are hard working small business owners and I wouldn't be surprised to see multiple locations someday.  The rest of Cleveland should not be denied this pizza."}
{"text":"What a gem of a pizza place tucked into a shopping center! This restaurant is very unassuming  from the outside but once you're inside and you can see the ever so beautiful wood fire oven your mind will start to wander and you will begin to drool.   The boyfriend and I had a fantastic experience here and for the first time in a long while we felt pleasantly full. We started with the Antipasto plate which at In Forno is their version of a Charcuterie board. It was filled with castelvetrano olives, prosciutto, grape tomatoes, wood fired  dough with rosemary and sea salt, Manchego cheese and soppressata. It looked so good that the table next to us ordered one when ours was served. We followed that with a Di Parma pizza (each pizza has 6 slices). The crust was perfection and the pizza was light but flavorful. We wanted to order another but we did limit ourselves for once. We finished the meal with a piece of their Limoncello Cake- thank goodness we did because that piece of cake was a little slice of heaven! This meal was awesome and we are so excited to have a great place in Avon!  Note: Bring your own wine. They provide glasses and a cork. There is also a wine store next door."}
{"text":"This is probably some of the best wood fired pizza in Cleveland area. George is a great host and makes you feel welcome. The price is inexpensive for the high quality of food and service you recieve. I ordered the Margehrita pizza, had some of my friend's caprese salad and finished it off with tirimisu. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Fabulous, all around. The pizza is delicious, the owners are friendly, the space is beautiful & clean. Wish we lived closer! We'd be there ALL the time! Even though we're an hours drive, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Found In Forno today. Great choice! The antipasta starter was perfect for two and then we picked the Mediterranean pizza. Excellent! Great service! Thank you George!!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN CLEVELAND!!! My boyfriend has turned me into quite the pizza consumer and we've bounced around town sampling new places around. This place by far is the best I've had in Cleveland. It's a simple family restaurant that produces authentic Italian pizza that's fired up in a matter of minutes. I wish it were closer to downtown but in all fairness I'd probably get in trouble and eat way too much of it if it were! The pizzas are cooked to perfection, with a thin crisp crust, just the right ratio of sauce : cheese and toppings that aren't lost in the mix. I also appreciate the family environment. The owners prepare the pizza and serve the tables and are very friendly and welcoming. Don't see that too often and it's just refreshing. Just typing this up is getting me thinking... maybe In forno for dinner tonight??"}
{"text":"Stopped in today and ate the best pizza ever   As a foodie my entire life this pizza is true thin crust Italian pizza with the freshest pizza anywhere. Go there and enjoy as it was as good as I had in Italy last year.   Going back real soon"}
{"text":"Wonderful Naples-style pizza. Great salads and gelatto too. Super friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of dining here this evening and we will certainly be back.  This is a great family owned and operated restaurant with a wonderful product.  We were introduced to this delightful pizza back in the summer at Wade Oval Wednesday and have been meaning to try the restaurant for quite some time.  We came for the pizza but started with a delicious fresh garden salad with blue cheese, tomato, onion and a light vinegarette dressing.  Yum!  The pizzas were light and airy, but had a wonderful texture and taste.  Dessert was a delicious slice of lemon gelato.  The perfect way to end a delightful meal!  If you haven't been there, don't wait to try it!!! It's worth the visit."}
{"text":"Wowza, good stuff.  A screaming hot wood fired pizza oven pumps out Neopolitan - style pizzas in about 6 minutes.  Fun red colors that tout other Italian brands on the walls.  Silver accents give it a sleek and modern feel.  Service was attentive and the pizza was on point.  The right balance of sauce, cheese and pepperoni for us.  And the crust...wood fired delicious chewy crust.  They have weekday lunch specials on certain pies for $8 or $9.  Sooo good.  Bravo to them.  I hope they open a location on the East Side."}
{"text":"Took my dad here for lunch last week since I read good reviews about the Neapolitan-style pizza and man, I am glad I did. It was fairly dead when we went but it was also 3 PM on a Wednesday so not prime hours. The two guys working were attentive and explained a few questions I had about the menu. Ordered the Di Parma and Margherita pizzas. They came out fairly quickly and they were FANTASTIC!   The Di Parma had a great saltiness from the prosciutto with a good earthiness from the arugula. The Margherita though was practically perfect! So simple with the balance of the ingredients and the quality of the dough. This one really stood out as possibly one of the best pizzas I have had in recent memory.  I wish I lived a little closer to Avon so I could get this pizza more often. I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you want to taste a true Neapolitan style pie cooked perfectly via old fashion wood fire; this is your place! Definitely fresh ingredients and their fresh homemade sauce is a feature all of its own that deserves its own accolades. The dough is handmade and fresh and come out perfectly with the right crisp char and steamy moist and soft center to every bite. All these parts combined are a medley of taste euphoria. Try this place!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Wish I new they didn't have a liquor license since they recommended to eat in I would have liked to have a glass of wine. The soda is a complete rip off at $2 a can!!  Wood fire pizza was good small portion for the cost. I would think 2 people could eat on a $14 pizza but neither of us was starving so it was ok."}
{"text":"This pizza place is plucked straight out of Italy. It has such an authentic look and oh my is it ever good. Not only is the pizza good but the people there are extremely nice and you can tell they make people become regulars just by their warm welcome and attitude."}
{"text":"This is a true gem, nestled in Avon, not to be missed!  Friendliest owners, very clean and well set up restaurant, and the authentic Neapolitan pizza is so good.  Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious and authentic pizza. A true Neapolitan spot..if you're in Cleveland, you've got to stop by for the Margherita, In Forno, awesome Pepperoni or any of their other amazing pies, guaranteed not to disappoint. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Not cheap, but cooked perfectly in their oven. The dough was a perfect combination of crispy and chewy. The toppings and cheese were fresh. And, you can bring your own bottle(s) of wine in. The staff/owners are super professional and friendly. I can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Tried on a whim.    Glad I did. Will be back. Great, wood fired pizza!  Wife found it here in yelp. Decided to try.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great atmosphere!  Currently it's BYOB. Nice cheese platter. Cute little place. great service too!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Napoli, Italy (birthplace of pizza), so I have tried pretty much all the Neapolitan style pizza in Cleveland (vero, crostatas, citizen pie, cibo...) and although some of them are quite good, the In Forno margherita is by far the best one I have ever had outside of Napoli.the dough is perfect, the amount and quality of condiments is just right, and the owner is friendly and very passionate about pizza and food.  I live on the east side but I am willing to make the trip every time because the pizza is definitely worth it!  Way to go George!!"}
{"text":"Just stumbled on possibly the best pizza on the planet, but definitely the best I've had in Ohio. Better than Sweet Basil, Capri, and Lorenzo's. They have this imported stone oven from Italy and their pies cook in... wait for it.... 90 seconds.   I had the Margaretha Pizza, so simple, but so tasty.  San Marzano crushed tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil.  I twent from made from scratch to my table in roughly 3 minutes.  That fire brick over is so hot it cooks the pizza so quickly.  My only complaint is that I didn't find this place sooner."}
{"text":"Just like pizza in Italy! No 2lbs of cheese to get flavor like american pizza shops. Perfetto! The bufala mozz is so much better than cow mozz. Would be nice to have a \"build-your-own\" on the menu. Maybe it's there and I just didn't see it. Will recommend again and again!"}
{"text":"Best pizza on the west side if you like authentic neopolanese style pizza. Simple, fresh ingredients with real mozzarella cheese.  This is the pizza place we hoped would open in Avon and Avon Lake."}
{"text":"We first had In Forno Pizza when they were at the Crocker Park Farmer's Market. The pizza was fresh and they always had a line!  Went to the restaurant tonight for the first time and were very impressed. Had the flatbread, a salad and the Mediterranean pizza. Everything was fantastic, from the service to the food to paying. Our waitress was on point not even letting us add our leftover pizza to the leftover flatbread in the box! She was sweet.  We will most definitely be returning!!!! BTW, it is currently BYOB."}
{"text":"This pizza is the real deal. So delicious with true whole ingredients. You can tell when you eat it that it's coming from someone kitchen, not a factory or assembly line of gross ingredients. This pizza is really tasty, with lots of choices. Hopefully one day they will deliver!"}
{"text":"Both the food and the hosts are amazing. Great high quality ingredients, amazing preparation with a lot of effort and love, fresh clean and new. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Yum! We got the pepperoni pizza and the bianco (white pizza) minus the tomatoes that it usually comes with. The crust was airy but crisp, and the ingredients on the pizza tasted very fresh. Our waitress was quick and attentive. The pizza was equally as quick! It didn't last long on our plates either. ;) I can't wait to come back for another round!"}
{"text":"Small family run pizza place. Best pizza and the freshest ingredients. This is not to be missed. This is a hidden gem in Avon. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great pizza and convenient location in Avon.  Picked up three pizzas for the girls (12 yrs old) and they really enjoyed the taste and ingredients of each of the pizzas and they are usually picky eaters.  Will be back soon and frequently."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing people!  Quality of the Pasta (aka pizza dough), is some of the best in the Country.  As a world Traveler and Foodie, I highly recommend this pizzeria!  Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"We started with the caprese salad... it was fresh and well-balanced. I ordered the Celeste pizza (TRUFFLE AND ARTICHOKE PASTE,TWO CHEESES, MUSHROOMS, ARUGULA, OLIVE OIL) and it was SO good. I love everything truffle, and this was exactly the right amount of flavor. My friend ordered something with the red sauce on it and I'm not really a red sauce person, but this sauce I loved. I wish I lived on the west side just so I could go to In Forno more often. This is the real deal."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, that is saying allot for a self proclaimed pizza snob...  Crust and sauce were awesome, just enough pepperoni to be flavorful but not so much that it overpowered the sauce. I would have given 5 stars but price is a touch on the high side and no single success available."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  My wife and I split the arugula salad and a margherita pizza and both were excellent.  The pizza was one of the best, if not the best, I've had in Cleveland - wood fired, thin crust with fresh ingredients.  Service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. Love the atmosphere and the family was super nice and welcoming. I loved watching them make each pizza. The pizzas were delicious and fresh. We got the Bianco, In Forno, and the Di Parma. I am in love with the Di Parma. The sauce is delicious and I am a big fan of prosciutto. My only issue was the prices were a tad high for my taste, but that's because I'm a broke college student."}
{"text":"We tried this place a few weeks after it opened and loved the fresh chewy Italian style pizzas. They were made quickly and served immediately. The quality of ingredients is what stood out. Overall the vibe of this new place wasn't that great and wasn't very \"cozy.\" All the tables were in one big room with a causal feel. It is BYOB though so you can save yourself a few bucks because the pizzas will cost $12++ a person."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. I would say it's the best in the area! Classic pizzas made right in front of you by the head chef, who takes lots of pride in his work. Everyone who works there is also very friendly and helpful. Only \"bad\" thing about it is that it is slightly on the expensive side, but you are truly paying for high quality food"}
{"text":"Moved to Cleveland from New York City six years ago.  For a while we really struggled to find good Neapolitan thin-crust pizza, especially on the West Side.  Then this place opened up.  Close to perfect, especially the dough, but don't even think about taking these pizzas home.  They take two minutes to cook and only a little more to eat.  Really solid and George is a class act."}
{"text":"Our fIrst yesterday, we will definitely be back.  Excellent pizza made with fresh ingredients and a nice, family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Fresh, fast and friendly service. Although small, the location looks great and is always immaculate. My only \"knock\" would be the price. It's a little much for the size of the pizza but they use fresh, high quality ingredients. You get what you pay for though. I'd rather pay more for quality than quantity. The family that owns this establishment are always kind while still hustling and bustling around the joint."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of the 5 star ratings I was seeing on Yelp, but I knew that the place couldn't be bad if it had a 5 star rating. This place definitely owned up the the 5 stars.  Walking into the place it is very clean and new.  You can tell they put a lot of thought into everything they do.    The food was absolutely spectacular.  I initially really wanted to try their antipasto but was wary of the price tag it had ($13) which was around the same price as the pizzas. After trying it I got extremely excited for the pizza.  The food was superb and was laid out nicely.    I recommend if you get pizza to get the red sauce.  They really seem to work hard on getting quality ingredients and it shows in their food.  I had the Four Season (white sauce) and my friend had the Di Parma (Red Sauce).  Both were amazing but the Red sauce is where they shined.  It had a sweetness you don't get from other pizza places.  After talking to one of the owners they told us that they are planning on doing coffee down the road. I am excited to see the quality of anything they do.  Do not fear simple from this restaurant because the quality of everything they had was perfect.   I am looking forward to be back in Avon again to come back here."}
{"text":"Really good pizza with fresh ingredients. I highly recommend this new local business."}
{"text":"Hooray! Delicious hand crafted pizza in an area that has chains as far as thee eye can see. We were so glad to find this place. Unfortunately, it is in a strip mall (where else would a place be located in Avon/Avon Lake), but do not let this fool you. Really great pizza with fresh ingredients. Very attentive family runs it and are charming on top of offering good food."}
{"text":"They are really unprofessional. The owner was incredibly rude to me; he gave me the DIRTIEST look as I picked up my food."}
{"text":"When we first moved to the area we were looking for a \"go to\" pizza place. We drove past In Forno and decided to given them a try. We are so glad we did! The pizza and salads are amazing! They always have our carry out ready in 10-15 minutes. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow such freshly made pizza with nice aroma and taste. The service is friendly. The owner is the chef. The crust is thin. We tried the white sauce based Celeste pizza with mushrooms and artichokes. The arugula leaves are freshly placed on the pizza. The tiramisu was creamy rich and fluffy. Perfect size to be shared by two. Worth the price and definitely will be revisiting. A true gem!!"}
{"text":"My wife & I had tried their pizza at Crocker Park when they had their mobile oven going & really liked it so we stopped in & sat down for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  We had their version of garlic bread, which was actually a pie size with oils, garlic & other herbs. It came whole & we just ripped into it, so if you want it sliced, just ask them.  Then we had their pepperoni pie & it was fantastic, you can tell everything was fresh & cooked to perfection!  True neopolitan brick oven pizza at it's finest. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great new place in Avon. Wonderful people and the pizza is amazing. We tried the classic (cheese and red sauce), pepperoni, and the Celeste (white pizza with truffle and artichoke paste along with mushrooms).  Everything was outstanding.  The dough is simply awesome."}
{"text":"Don't let the unassuming pizza place in a strip center throw you, this place has EXCELLENT wood fired pizzas! Highly recommend the white pizza w truffle and artichoke paste, mushrooms, and arugula (and I'm not a huge white pizza fan) as well as the margarita pizza. The crust and ingredients are top notch."}
{"text":"Absolutely best pizza in CLE! We just discovered it, and we'll be coming back again. True Italian pizza and gelato. Unless you want to fly to Italy this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Went here tonight and had amazing pizza and salad.   The flavor and freshness of the pizza will keep me coming back for more.  Thank you to the family for great service as well.  Family owned and family run.  Great to see small businesses thriving."}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic!  Being from the east coast, I'm always complaining about the lack of good pizza in Cleveland.... In Forno definitely gets pizza right!  A little $$ but worth it!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place wasn't totally packed with people. We stopped here on our way out of Cleveland and to Detroit. We sat at the bar and met the owner, George, who was the most gracious host. While we chatted, we watched him make our fresh neapolitan pizza. We ordered the antipasto plate to start-absolutely wonderful selection of savory meats, cheeses and olives. We loved the olives so much that George had them bring us a few more to enjoy while our pizza baked! The pizza had a crisp crust and perfect ratio of toppings. We had the tiramisu for dessert, which was also tasty. Stop in here. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"When we saw the reviews we figured we HAD to give this place a shot. My wife and I love this kind of pizza and Inforno COMPLETELY met our expectations.   The owners are very friendly, the ingredients are the best they can get their hands on, and the experience was very satisfying.   I spoke with the owner who told me that he spent 4 years perfecting the dough - FOUR YEARS. And let me tell you, it paid off because it is genuinely excellent. He even designed and built the interior of the restaurant - which is simple, classy, and welcoming.  My wife was appreciative of the CLEAN restrooms that had a baby changing station + wipes that helped so much with our 4 month old.  We plan on returning even though we live almost an hour away."}
{"text":"Authentic wood fired pizza. I closed my eyes as I ate my Pizza and thought I was back in Italy. This is the real thing; quality,  fresh, and few ingredients.     Salads are really good too. You can tell care is also taken in selecting produce.   Can't get enough!"}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to Lorain County's barren pizza landscape. Great artisan pizzas with fresh toppings and a wonderful crust. The toppings are perhaps a bit too scarce from bite to bite -- for example, I had prosciutto on only 2 of the 6 slices of my pizza, but the two pizzas we had were just wonderful. Very friendly service too. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This was an AMAZING experience! My fiancé and I were in search of \"the best\" brick oven wood fired Pizza, and we're willing to travel far to get it. We've tried several places with okay, to good, to disappointing experiences. What a pleasant surprise to find that such a great Pizza... or I should say, Neopolitan Pizza place is so close to home. We sat at the bar, which I highly recommend, and watched as the gentleman created his masterpiece. As we sat watching him craft several different versions of delicious looking creations, we saw how much he cared about what he was doing. While engaging in conversation with him, we discovered that this artisan; George was the owner, and his entire family worked along side of him. Let me tell you, that is one more thing that makes this place special! Service, and customer satisfaction is only surpassed by the taste of the pizza. But it's hard to tell what is better, after leaving with full stomachs, a friendly good by from George and his family, and an anticipated craving for our next visit! Go here! Skip all others for today... you WON'T regret it!"}
{"text":"Amazing brick oven pizza!!  We stopped here based on the Yelp reviews and the fact that they have a brick oven. We just bought one ourselves and the chef was more than happy to give us tips and tricks. We ate the Four Seasons and the cheese and the salad with blue cheese.  Kids devoured the cheese. We devoured the Four Seasons. The salad was fantastic too."}
{"text":"This place seems unassuming but may just be cooking up the best slice in The Land! It has the napoleon feel of Citizen Pie with the flavor of Angelo's. My brother told me this was the best pizza in the city and he may be right. We got the Margherita DOP and the pepperoni, both of which were amazing. The crust is flavorful and perfectly cooked, and the cheese melts in your mouth. The staff is welcoming, friendly and fast as well! Couldn't have asked for a better pizza experience."}
{"text":"After a long morning of shopping, before New Years  Eve, we decided having pizza is always a good choice. We happened to pass by this pizza place and it happens to have good reviews so we gave it a try. The outside looks a bit plain but the inside was very modern and clean looking. The family who operated it were very nice and helpful. After overlooking the menu we went with the Pizza di Parma. Didn't take too long to cook and it came out on a plate looking awesome. Perfectly cooked with toppings and mozzarella and prosciutto. The think crust was very authentic and the sauce was pretty good as well. Overall I would say this was a great Napoli style authentic pizza. It was very good. So good that after we finished this pizza we ordered a pepperoni pizza which was equally as good! Make sure to ask for the spicy pepper oil which takes it to the next level. I recommend this spot for a pizza and I'll be going again!"}
{"text":"Finally!! My husband and I have been to Italy a few times. We had yet to find a true Italian pizza until today. In fact, when we met George the owner we asked him to make us anything. We were delited in his caring approach to making the pizza and his service and friendliness. Darby also as our young server."}
{"text":"Amazing brick oven thin crust pizza, made right before your eyes. The owners are incredibly friendly as well. The dining room is on the smaller side, but I've never had trouble getting a table at lunch time on the weekened. I'm not sure how busy they get in the evenings. They don't have beer or wine on the menu but are cool with byob. A+ experience overall"}
{"text":"Went back to try it again picked up two pizzas a pepperoni and spinach $30 for 2 pizzas about the size of a medium Pizza both were tasteless cooked okay nothing special this place is a joke"}
{"text":"Went there with high expectations and was underwhelmed. The service was great but the pizza had little taste and under cooked."}
{"text":"Wow, I came here unplanned because I was in the area.   All I can say is YUM. The fresh ingredients, the care the pizza is made with, the wonderful customer service, this place is a GEM.   I had a white pizza, that was to die for, just the right amount of oil and cheese. Perfect.   *PS I went right over to The Wine Room while waiting for my pizza and In Forno gave me an opener and a glass. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"The restaurant was a bit cramped, but you weren't sitting on top of your neighbors.  But the pizzas were very good.  They were as close to Italian pizza as I've had.  I thought they were a bit pricey for the size, but they were good enough to let that slide.  The dessert was very good also.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow! What an incredible find. We had the Caprese appetizer followed by the Margarita Pizza.  You could taste the freshness of each ingredient. The atmosphere and service were wonderful as well. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I went to Naples, Italy last year for work and got to taste how amazing pizza could really be.  Stumbled upon In Forno's restaurant in Avon last night and I was excited to give it a try since their sign said it was Napolese-style.  This was EXACTLY the same quality and taste as the pizza I got in Italy.  The owners are super nice and take pride in their product.  Do yourself a favor and go to their new restaurant in Avon.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best pizza I've had in years! You watch the guy put the pizza into a fire oven!  Amazing!!!!!! Service was great!  I wish I lived closer cause I'd be back often.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very warm and casual atmosphere; it is the perfect place to get together with friends and family. The owners are very friendly and sweet. The service is prompt and courteous, delivering the most delicious authentic Neapolitan pizza, made from the freshest of ingredients and cooked for a couple of minutes in an extremely hot, wood burning oven which produces a crust that is chewy, crunchy and charred in spots. In Forno doesn't only make pizza; they also have a wide variety of incredible appetizers and desserts, such as Limoncello and Tiramisu cake, gelato and espresso.  This is a great place to enjoy a fantastic pizza!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing. If you can, sit at the bar where you can see the pizza going in/out of the oven and talk to the owner. He is a true pizza craftsman and takes great care in his product."}
{"text":"My wife and I love food and trying good pizza joints. The owners have a great startup story, but even before hearing their story the food was amazing. Simple and incredibly fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Best Neapolitan pizza on west side of Cleveland. A little pricey.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a great non-chain option in the Avon area. Owners take a lot of care to ensure a good experience. The pizza is neapolitan, cooked in an 850* wood-fired oven; so it takes only a few minutes to cook. Very tasty! I would give a higher rating if there were expanded toppings options, full bar and expanded salad choices. Outside of those suggestions, it's a great place for a meal."}
{"text":"The pizza here is fabulous and there is nothing like it in the area. The people are very kind and it looks like they really love what they do."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at In Forno Pizza and we will be back because of the service and food The greeting by the staff was very welcoming. We had a friend who is 84 years old, they took care of his walker, gave us a table that was very accessible to all of us. Emily, our waitress, was truly customer service motivated. She brought our refreshments promptly, took our order and delivered it exactly as requested, very timely. She checked with us several times while we enjoyed our pizzas. We were glad we came to eat dinner here and have added this location to our top restaurant lists. Ed and June"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  Highly recommend if you're in the area!  The Four Seasons is a white pizza and our go- to, but everything we have tried has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent Neapolitan pizza with lots of creative toppings. If you've had their pies from the portable oven these are better because temperatures (for both the dough and the cooking) are more easily controlled indoors. The space is small, loud and probably usually full of children (as it was on my visit). It has all the charm of its strip mall location, but I don't really care because the pizza is great. I really enjoy the BYOB aspect as well. Very happy to have this option for pizza."}
{"text":"Wonderful true Neapolitan pizza. Finally on the west side   Very true to the dop standards. And yes even mozzarella do buffala."}
{"text":"Non chain. Owners take pride in their work.  Pizza is great. Will continue supporting."}
{"text":"Heard wonderful things about the pizza here, so had to investigate myself!  The look, smell, and taste of the pizza reminds me of what I've had in Italy.  Pies are authentic with quality ingredients and artfully made in a hot brick oven... Well worth the experience- even if you have to drive far to get there."}
{"text":"pizza in forno in the clay igloo of heat ninety second joy  Saw these guys at the downtown farmers market.  Terrific pizza!  The concept is brilliant; they bring a traditional clay pizza oven to your event, party, place of work, or cubicle. Real Italian pizza, cooked in 90 seconds.   Carry on..."}
{"text":"I finally found my little piece of New York away from home! The interior and Decour is absolutely gorgeous. Very elegant without being pretentious. You can step up to the marble bar and watch your pizza being made. Hands-down the best thin crust I've ever had. Simple, delicious, wonderful and somewhere I encourage everyone to dry. The owner and staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. One of the best I've had in the Greater Cleveland area. The owners are extremely friendly, the food comes out fast, and the pizza was absolutely phenomenal. It took me about 45 minutes to get here and it was well worth the drive! I will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Family owned and you can taste the pride. Daughter bragging about her dads home made ovens at home to mom and dad coming out to talk to me some tricks and lessons learned I will definitely take home.  Reasonable prices outstanding food awesome service"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we are hoping for it not to be our last! We just went to look at a house to purchase and may just buy the house for the pizza! Clean, modern and trendy environment. Very friendly staff and delicious pizza!  Fresh ingredients on the pizza and tastes authentic. Would definitely recommend In Forno!"}
{"text":"Artisan pizza at fair prices. Good flavor and pretty good customer service but the restaurant is small and fills up very quickly. I probably won't go back - it wasn't SO good that I feel I'll want it again."}
{"text":"These people know pizza! Stopped in after work to talk pizza and grab a bite! The owners are incredible people. Very kind and enjoyable to sit and talk with. Not to mention they make an incredible pie! I went with a Buffala mozz marg and it was on point!!! Stop in and bring your friends! This place is a hidden gem. It's not an easy task making pizza of this high caliber. Great respect for this craft!"}
{"text":"This place is an authentic gem!!! Family run and owned - George and Elizabeth and their daughter are the sweetest people! The pizzas were incredible and you could taste the freshness of each ingredient....all were top quality and so tasty. The Vegetarian pizza is a favorite (and we are not even vegetarians!), the di Parma was delicious too and we are taking an in Forno to go which looks incredible. Highly recommend!!!! We will be regulars for sure!  Oh and don't miss the antipasto appetizer. A huge slab of Manchego cheese (my favorite), garlic bread, prosciutto, salami, olives and the freshest tomato salad! Incredible and so reasonably priced.   They are also byob and don't charge a corkage or anything. It's fantastic!!! Avon is super lucky to have In Forno!  P.s. This place is family run and the family should take vacations from time to time and shouldn't get a 2 star review from someone just because the place was closed for a family vacation...Especially from someone who has never tried their food. Silliness! The beauty of a family run and non chain restaurant! This place is our favorite!!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night for the first time and loved it. The pizza was great you can tell they use fresh, quality ingredients.  The staff was very nice, i will definitely be coming back and would highly recommend to anyone looking to try a new pizza place."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday with my sister and I will be returning soon. I was beyond impressed with both the quality of the food and the service. We got the arugula salad, margherita with salami, and the tiramisu and we ate every last bit of it. The serving sizes are perfect for two people and the quality of the ingredients is the best in the area. Our server, Emily, gave great recommendations and added to the friendly environment. Cool joint. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Great wood-fired pizza. I will come back for more! A little high on price for the amount of food though. Not a bargain, but very good quality."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town for wedding where we ended up having car problems. After missing the reception we came across In Forno Pizza. The atmosphere was very family oriented. Emily our waitress was very accommodating, and was such a doll. But who made this experience memorable was the owner Mr. George and of course the food! Mr. George was so sweet, we could tell he loved what he was doing. But the food... literally the BEST pizza we have ever had!! We had ordered a white sauce and red sauce pizza and it was hands down amazing. The char on the crust wasn't over bearing, like most Small pizza shops.  Will definitely be stopping by again whenever we're back in Ohio."}
{"text":"Drove by and stopped for a pizza. It was delicious. Would come back again if I was in the area. Owner was there and very friendly."}
{"text":"Divine!! If you like authentic pizza, this is the spot. Ingredients are so fresh. We had the salad with blue cheese- loved the honey balsamic! And then we had the pizza with prosciutto. Wow! So good. You'll be surprised at how filling one pizza is- salad and pizza for two was perfect.  The owners are so kind and really believe in the quality of ingredients and product and it shows.  What a great spot in this neighborhood. We will be back. Noted that they have lunch specials from 12-3pm which will make me come back sooner!"}
{"text":"This is not an \"American\" pizza place. First I will say that it is not inexpensive. Next is that it is 100% worth it. If you want a cheap slice, do not come here. If you want the best ingredients put together by someone who knows what they are doing (George), this is the place for you. Even his oven is the real deal (stefano ferrara). It makes a difference. His son ( David) was our waiter and he is wise beyond his years. Needless to say, it will be one of my new regular spots."}
{"text":"A-MAZING!  Where do you begin to describe a place like In Forno?  Situated in a strip plaza next to a Chinese take out/delivery joint, it would be easy to assume that In Forno is just another pizza shack that you may or may not want to try rather than your local Papa Johns.  Nothing could be further from the truth...It really is a pearl in a sea full of empty oysters.  First impression upon walking in are how modern and clean everything is.  Not that that is a bad thing, however it does give one a sense of \"what kind of place did I just walk into.\"  About two seconds later you see the heart of this restaurant....the oven.  Hand made.  Wood fired.  Blazing hot.  Able to cook a pizza to perfection in the 60 to 90 seconds required by the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana for authentic Neapolitan pizza.  We were then greeted by warm, honest, welcoming smiles from the staff.  Given the fact that there were only two of us, combined with my fascination with the oven, we requested to be seated at the bar.    This is a BYOB restaurant and our waitress was quick to provide us with a couple of wine glasses and an opener to indulge on some delicious Italian wine (there happens to be a wine shop a couple of stores down...coincidence?) without the normal hassle of a cork fee.  From the bar's vantage point we began our meal by enjoying their arugula salad and the antipasto plate.  Both were delicious, but the garlic bread (baked in the magic oven) gave a hint at the deliciousness that was to come.  We mulled over the menu while casually talking with the owner and chef George Goodman.  After much hemming and hawing, we ordered our first pizza.  Margherita, add prosciutto.  We enjoyed watching George and his staff work quickly and efficiently as they prepared our pie.    Before we knew it, the pizza was delivered.  We spent a moment staring at it with anticipation and enjoying the smells...(and the required picture or two)...before digging in.  About as fast as it was prepared...it was gone.  Delicious.  Light, slightly crunchy but chewy in the right way dough was complimented perfectly with the toppings.  Saddened by the fact that that the pizza was gone...we quickly ordered another.  The Di Parma...which also didn't last long.  We were so excited to dig in, that I completely forgot to snap a single picture, but we were just as happy with the last bite of this pizza, as we were with the first bite of the margherita.    Not wanting the night to end we ordered and split their limoncello cake.  Perfect fresh/tart ending to an amazing meal.  Thank you to George and the Goodman family for opening such an amazing spot in Avon, OH.  I honestly don't think it's possible to order anything in this restaurant and not be pleased with it....but I plan on coming back enough to verify that fact :)"}
{"text":"Yum yum!  We don't really frequent Avon that much, but was in the area and was looking for a quick bite to eat. After seeing the reviews of In Forno, we decided to pay it a visit.  It's located in a strip plaza- right off of Center road. We found a table right away (on a Thurs night at 6:30), and sat down.  We decided to go with a white pizza (they have options for both white and red), and chose the Four Seasons. It was a mix of two cheeses, mushrooms, basil, and prosciutto. And it was delicious. In Forno has a stone oven which they make their pizzas in, in a short time of five minutes. And it came out so delicious- flavorful, a soft chewy crust that wasn't too oily, and fresh. It was just an overall great pizza.  I was pleasantly surprised and I think you will be too if you stop here. Check it out and order one of their delicious pizzas!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time to just check it out, so glad I did! Looks modern and thought it would be the quality of a normal chain pizza shop... nope. Surprisingly a great Italian feel and quality ingredients. I ordered the margarita pizza, cheese plate, arugula salad. All good and will have again"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza place! Super high-quality ingredients and awesome crust. Super legit Neopolitan style pizza. Came in with my family (8 people) and couldn't believe how fast our food came out. Everyone in my family absolutely loved their food. Service was perfect and the owners were SO nice. My 12 year old niece, who is an extremely picky eater, said it was the best food she's ever had and that she wants to work there when she gets in high school lol."}
{"text":"This is real pizza, the way it supposed to be made and taste.  The proprietors are super nice and the place is very clean.  Again, this is pizza, what you normally get probably isn't."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've ever had, and I consider myself a good judge of pizza. Perfect blend of flavors in concert with each other. I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in there for a quick bite on a monthly Costco trip out in the burbs.  I was pleasantly surprised. Good Neapolitan pizza, quality ingredients and amazing friendly service. Choices are limited but what they do, they do well. The simple sauce was very flavorful and the crust was perfect!  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This pizza is the real deal! A hidden gem in an Avon strip mall, In Forno serves up the best wood fired Neapolitan Pizza on the West Side. The dough is perfect, ingredients are fresh and of the highest quality. George is an artisan and master of his craft. Vegetarian Friendly and now serving alcohol. If you love pizza get to In Forno ASAP!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is the real deal! I stopped in here after seeing all the positive reviews here and boy was it delicious. The pizzas are the equivalent of a large anywhere else and even though I hit a stopping point and was full, I sat there a minute and decided to finish it off! The flavor is top notch. All of the ingredients pop with freshness. I got the Four Season and I couldn't recommend it more. It had regular pizza toppings as well as what I consider premium pizza toppings for the same prize of what you'd pay elsewhere for just regular. The atmosphere of the dining room is bright and clean and our server, one of the owners I believe, was very friendly and attentive. I'm usually prefer common style pizza over the Neapolitan style, but this made me a believer. I tried their red sauce and it was outstanding and I can't wait to try the white next time!"}
{"text":"Great place for great food! Very fresh ingredients, wonderful service.  The restaurant was very clean and well cared for. The owners definitely take pride in their space and their food."}
{"text":"My husband and I have almost made it our mission to find the best pizza. Hands down In Forno's pizza and its authenticity, makes this my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Wow.  Had lunch here today and it did not disappoint.  The back of the menu goes into great detail about rules governing pizza making in Italy.  From the dough, sauce, ingredients, etc.  The oven is a wood burning oven.  And it cooks the pizza in 60-90 seconds.  Guy making the pizza is very talkative.  He's very proud of making pizza and pointed out that's all they make there.  He also said the dough is made from Italian ingredients.  I had the pepperoni pizza.  It was $15.  Ok, so it's not exactly cheap for a lunch pie.  But I ate the whole thing it was so good.  Tender, chewy crust.  Sauce that tastes like it was flown in from Milano.  Cheese that was outstanding.  I can't say enough about how amazing this pizza was.  If you are going to do just 1 thing you better do it well.  This goes beyond that."}
{"text":"I didn't quite know what this place was until someone posted about it on my Facebook group. I was skeptical at first but my group has always given great recommendations and I was looking for a really good non-chain pizza place near me. The first time I went, I was instantly floored, it was a small shop with an amazing wood fired pizza oven! In front of the oven was the owner tossing and stretching fresh balls of dough and making pizzas to order. No standard delivery fare here! The pizza bianco, my first pie from here, was so good that it didn't make it home!! I've since had the margherita and celeste and each one is as good as the last. The don't skimp on quality here!! The owner actually pulls balls of fresh mozzarella apart to put on the pizzas, has a vendor from Valley City that produces the amazing mushrooms he uses, and trays of hydroponic lettuce for salads. I'm also pretty positive he makes his own pizza sauce too. The pizzas are cooked to a bubbly perfection in 90 seconds in that awesome oven! Not to mention they have some pretty darned good tiramisu as well. This pizza place is a no frills pizza and salads eatery. They have good, hand made, pizzas and salads with premium ingredients and lots of love. The family who owns and runs this gem are very friendly and love to chat! I will never buy pizza anywhere else now (despite my occasional laziness and delivery wants) because no other pizza tastes as good as what In Forno makes to me. Check them out!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is definitely quality. We had two pizzas when we came. Nice thin crust with the wood fire taste. Delicious! My only gripe is the prices. While I'll pay extra for good pizza, they also charged $2 for two tiny Cokes. While that's typical in Italy, that's not what I expect in Avon. But enough about that. Come here for this pizza (not the Coke) and you definitely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Pizza Napolitana.Im originally from italy and i do say is the real pizza. Now Americans can have real italian pizza without flying to italy"}
{"text":"Overall, I LOVED Il Forno. I wish yelp had .5 and .75 rating options. Sooo close to a five. Our tastes aren't accustomed to the wood burnt crust edge flavoring. Great atmosphere with European inspiration - wonderful intimate seating, decent adult bev selection, and fresh, gorgeous flowers. Plus, who can't love the cutest kids drink ware and booster seats?! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Based on all the excellent reviews on Yelp, we visited In Forno Pizza this evening.  We were not disappointed and it is clear why so many others rave about In Forno.  The service was first rate.  The pizza was excellent.  The beer and wine selection was excellent.  Local beers are highlighted which is welcome.  This will certainly not be our last time visiting this charm of a restaurant in Avon!"}
