{"text":"I got the Chef's Special, Teriyaki Chicken with fried rice and vegetables.  It was cooked while waiting so everything was fresh.  The chicken was not heavily coated like some places.  It was just right.  The fried rice was authentic and fresh.  For an outlet mall restaurant, I would definitely eat here again and recommended to anyone."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Not sure what grade the food is but comparable to TV dinner meals. And over priced. Meat is rubber like."}
{"text":"I have no idea how the poor review came from. This is the best hibachi I have ever had in the great Charlotte area. I am so surprised that I could find one with such a great taste in a outlets food court. I ordered the beef chicken teriyaki with double chicken and little spicy and my wife ordered shrimp beef teriyaki with double beef and little spicy. And they were so good. I will definitely come to the outlets in the future just for this hibachi."}
{"text":"I got the chicken teriyaki. HORRIBLE. My mom ordered the same and we both took one bite a d had to spit it out. The chicken was rubbery and cold. To be honest it did not even look like chicken..."}
{"text":"Their hibachi is very delicious! The meat is so juicy. Highly recommended. (in order to make it loooooooooooooooooooong enough)"}
{"text":"So awesome! Teriyaki chicken well seasone and moist. Prices are reasonable. Chicken was not dry at all. Will definitely come back. Oh and the shrimp sauce is to die for!"}
