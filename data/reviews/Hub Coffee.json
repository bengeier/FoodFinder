{"text":"Great atmosphere, ample bike parking, big windows, great food. I had the breakfast on a bun and it was so so good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's clear that Hallam and Dovercourt is an up and coming spot and Hub is leading the way. The place has a cool vibe and the owners are so friendly and fun to talk to. The coffee is great and the food is fresh and delicious, I order something new every time and I'm always very impressed."}
{"text":"The muffins are salty and greasy. The breakfast scones often have egg shells in them. There is little variety in the food choices and the soup is bland. Basically after hearing about how great this place is supposed to be  I still don't get it. The coffee is alright, but the tea is ALWAYS watery and gross. There used to be agave syrup, that has been replaced by simple syrup. Simple syrup is sugar and water and tastes disgusting. This place has going downhill fast. Over priced, salty food. Not worth the effort to support these clowns. My family and friends are all avoiding this rip of environment."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and food!  They use thoughtful and fresh ingredients!  Great breakfast sandwich and pressed sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great place for coffee and brunch on a dus at morning. Delicious muffins and food. Eggs are great!"}
{"text":"still bitter they closed the shaw location, but I mean I get why.. I just preferred the small closer space.     1 star for their iced coffee 1 star for their B.O.B breakfast on a bun.  tasty, under 5$ 1 star for their nice crew, always the same 3-4 people.  Go grab a sandwich & a coffee it'll be a dece time!"}
{"text":"After waiting 15 minutes for a chicken sandwich I asked if it was almost done. They said they haven't even started it yet. Then I just asked to have it cold. Still took them 5 minutes just to make it.  It was tasty tho. But not worth the 20 min wait for a cold sandwich."}
{"text":"A great spot with really good coffee. The service is very friendly. A fair amount of tables to sit down and work for the afternoon. Though if you go in the summer it can get really hot in there. The food I had was decent, it didn't blow me away but it hit the spot."}
{"text":"Basically this is the best place you can go for a breakfast sandwich. A Bob is a breakfast on a bun and it has bacon, old cheddar, mayo and hoisin on a bun. It's a guarantee your morning starts out with no temper tantrum. Exactly what you wanted and for a super cheap price.  Coffee is great. But really the place is about the people working there. They remember your name, your order and they actually really like their customers. The two new owners are late twenties and best friends. You sort of get the sense you are going to go hang out with friends. I also seem to run into every writer and artist I know. Ready to stare at their laptops or take the occassional break and talk about their projects. This is the sort of place that can be your Toronto.  I can't recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"This place is really cute. My partner and I stopped going out for brunch for the past year as we had exhausted the options around the bloorcourt 'hood, but one fateful Saturday morning I spotted this place on my Yelp listings. We both had a very tasty benny along with a french press. Very tasty + good vibes! Not so great on the weekdays.  EDIT: they've replaced their tasty faux english muffin on the benny dish with something v. boring/dense  EDIT: they've replaced their boring/dense english muffin with the tasty thing again. Huzzah!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, coffee and food.  Particularly love the BOB (breakfast on a bun).  The hoisin sauce is a nice touch - magical you could say.  Also highly recommend the honey ginger latte. Whatever you do, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this past Sunday and I was really impressed. Stayed for brunch with a few friends and the place was alive with a lot of people either stopping and staying, or grabbing something to go.   I ordered the eggs Benedict and was certainly impressed. The hollandaise has a lemon tang to it and it was served with sweet potato fries, which were both new to me and very delicious. The coffee was very fresh (how can it not be when it is French pressed?) and the staff were friendly and professional.   Even though it is a bit of a drive for me, coming from Richmond Hill, this is definitely a place I'll check out when I'm downtown."}
{"text":"I love it when my Yelp app points me in the direction of something awesome!  This was my experience today when I was wandering around Dovercourt/Bloorcourt Village with an empty tummy and a heavy laptop on my back. Where to find food and comfort!? Yelp tells me I'm steps away from the Hub and the other yelpers are raving, so I head over.  I'm going to admit that I have low expectations for places that are calling themselves coffee houses, because they spend all their energy coming up with new techniques for roasting beans and don't consider food beyond how it will pair with the brew du jour. I didn't know that the Hub actually cares about both. I got a well crafted coffee that didn't make my ears tingle (if it's really bitter, is it supposed to be good?) and a turkey provolone sandwich was mmmmm mmmm good!   Also, I would have happily had a bowl of that coleslaw side - how about a daily coleslaw special for us veggie lovers?  And then it's also got this great relaxed vibe that actually helped me get some work done. I'm in paradise! Would have loved to see more outlets, but the free and solid wifi makes up for that.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee with a cool vibe! The perfect neighborhood coffee shop with a focus on organic local and sustainable produce. Menu is pretty simple, but the grill cheese was tasty. Free wifi and perfect spot for work or a coffee date. The staff are incredibly friendly. Go here!"}
{"text":"I really like the Hub. I used to make the whole 3 block walk for a cup of strong coffee when the Hub was at the previous location on Shaw, but now it's even more convenient at it's location on Hallam & Dovercourt. Really adds to the little neighbourhood developing at this intersection!  The Hub has a chill, quiet vibe with unobtrusive music and usually free tables for doing work/reading during the week. On the weekend it seems to get quite packed with the brunch crowd, which I haven't tried (I tried the B.O.B--breakfast-on-a-bun at their old place) but there is a walk up counter where you can grab coffee, cookies, muffins, and scones to go.  HIghlights: get the iced coffee, a delicious, strong, and refreshing jolt of caffeine. Also, for those who are gluten averse--the double chocolate gluten free cookie (salted or not) is amazing!"}
{"text":"It can be a little hard to find a spot to sit because this place is so popular, and I totally get why! Really nice staff and a laid back vibe. The pastries are delicious as is the coffee, and the prices are average. It's great to watch passersby in the window or to sit with people in the back.  I just wish there was a patio.  I think this will be a regular Sunday laptop/coffee/people watch spot for me."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my in-laws and the Hubster. It's a neat spot with very friendly staff and mostly great food. I ordered the traditional breakfast with the Mennonite breakfast sausage. The sausage was super dry and crumbly, but everything else, the sweet potatoes, salad and slaw, were great!  I really liked the relaxed atmosphere and could see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Great coffee cool ambiance, small kitchen with huge talent. Brunch, pastry smoothies.. ! Great addition to dovercourt."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good! Veggie sandwich was well balanced and the seasoned pumpkin seeds were a nice touch. Coffee was excellent!"}
{"text":"The Hub is now one of my favorite spots in town! Cozy, friendly, laid back. Excellent lunch and brunch! Great service, good coffee and delicious sweets!   For lunch, I have the soup of the day, grilled cheese sandwich and they come with a side of fruit and nuts!   For brunch, I have the eggs Benedict and it is soooo good! On the side, sweet potatoes and a fresh salad!  My cappuccino is always perfect and the staff is friendly and professional. Asher and Jake are just great owners, they are really wonderful with their costumers and passionate people."}
{"text":"Always love the Hub since their days on Shaw. I don't live in Toronto but I always make sure to stop by for a breakfast BOB sandwich and a coffee. Always friendly and always good. Wish we had something just like this in Austin TX. Lots of great places there but no Hub. Check it out. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"It took me a while to finally check out this spot, especially considering that it is only a few streets from my house, and much closer than any other similar option.  Upon my first visit, the service, food, coffee and vibe were all fantastic.  And I loved how the layout buffers noise and offers a few nooks to settle into for quiet work or a conversation.  Shortly after my first visit, my home-office internet went down, and I ended up here again for the better part of a day.  Once again, staff were great, the food was superb and I found an awesome temporary workspace.   Bonus: their daily homemade soup is delicious, beautifully presented and the generous portion is very fairly priced at $6 (including bread, cup of slaw and roasted nuts as sides)."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite and the BOB did not disappoint. A great spot to grab a good coffee and enjoy the morning."}
{"text":"This is my local cafe. I love the employees there. Doug is great, Asher is hilarious.   Coffee is great, BOB sandwich is great, popsicles in the summer are delish, tea is nice. I wish the service was a bit faster. It can be a little bit slow - there is not a huge sense of urgency and I don't know about others but when I need caffeine, I NEED caffeine!   Food is rich and delicious and the staff is beyond friendly. It's great for mid-week coffee dates and business meetings. Weekends are crazy busy!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop! We were here right around opening, in time for warm out of the oven muffins. The chai latte is on the milder, sweeter side, just the way I like it and the BOB (breakfast on a bun) is delicious if you want something a bit more heavy with some grease. The front room has a few tables and there is another room towards the rear with more tables and seating."}
{"text":"I had the best gluten free bar/treat I've probably ever had EVER at Hub, coconut raspberry bar or something like that, honestly jaw-dropping level of tastiness. The coffee and service are also really wonderful and it's so warm and welcoming inside, it's hard not to love it"}
{"text":"Sweet tunes, chilled vibe, I had Grilled Cheese and black coffee which was good, they put pesto and something else on the cheese which was a nice touch! My friend got the BOB which he said has great! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Really great coffee shop with friendly staff. They make a great latte and Americano. They also have a great brunch and lunch menu with smoothies made with yogurt and apple juice. They also have lots of baked goods.   There are lots of tables, including a section in the back which is great because it means you can usually walk in and find somewhere to sit without waiting.   They offer drip coffee to go in a cool way. If you are in a rush you can fill up yourself pay with change without having to wait in line.   The crowd is a mix of young people, creative types and families with young kids. It's a great community gathering point with a chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really nice Americano, and local Orange Juice. Amazing Eggs Benny! Fresh, filling and really good value. Will be coming again!"}
{"text":"This god forsaken joint wasted a half our of my day and ended up giving me the wrong sandwich twice. I go in to grab the breakfast on a bun with no mayo and avocado added. First of all they forget my order which I can understand because it was busy. After I remind them, they take 10 minutes to make the order after which I proceed to find out there is mayo on it. I ask for it to be remade and after another 10 minutes they bring me a new one and as I'm driving home I realize they didn't even put bacon in it. $7.50 for a breakfast sandwich is pretty steep in the first place, but the customer service is just abysmal. Don't waste your time or your money. Starbucks makes better breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Okay so I don't know if this one will replace my other post, but I don't think it will... I was ranting and raving about how AMAZING the muffins are at the hub... well, the hub has undergone managerial changes, or so I've heard and what I sense. I am not in this place everyday to know for certain though. I would go whenever I craved a muffin... BUT, those muffins have changed... I will not go as far as to say they are bad... but they are different and when you fall in love with something, like a muffin, you'd kinda like it to stay the same.  So, their morning muffins, have less nuts in them. The old ones had full half walnuts and full almonds on the top, plus some inside. The new morning muffins, have crushed/chopped (* sounds better) nuts on top and very few within the muffin itself. That's kinda disappointing, since in the morning it's the protein hit, I seek. What is nice about the changed muffin is the dates.. they have dates to sweeten it, which I don't know if they did originally, but is something I noticed that I quite enjoyed.  Their chocolate muffins... are now with Zucchini. This is great if you like zucchini and even better if you find the combination of zucchini + chocolate, divine, I don't. I am not a HUGE no. 1 fan of zucchini, I don't hate it, but it doesn't agree with me and chocolate and zucchini together, while it adds moisture yet ultimately what is going through my head is... WHY? WHY? WHY? I really don't get the appeal here... seriously! WHY?... but that's me.   Needless to say I will reconsider future trips to this cafe... I can make pretty kickass muffins myself and I can prepare them the way I like, without feeling guilty or bad for being so picky (like not liking zucchini in my CHOCOLATE muffin)... or feeling like I am being judged (this typically happens at other places, not the hub and  is one of the major reasons I actually like the HUB) because they are so not pretentious and judgey. They're smiley, welcoming and usually incredibly friendly too."}
{"text":"Lots of seating and cute location. Great playlist making the atmosphere even more welcoming. They have delicious looking pastries and from what we saw other people eating, a great breakfast/brunch menu. I got a tea that was a really good size and the barista's were very friendly. :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding service. We came here for breakfast today and were the first people to sit down. Nice healthy bustle from neighbourhood customers followed with a parade of happy dogs.   I've been struggling with a restrictive diet for the past few months and it's always made more difficult by travel. These folks were creative, patient and accommodating as soon as I articulated my needs. I got the breakfast in a bun without the bun with a baby arugula side salad and fresh tomatoes sliced in the side. My egg was layered with cheese and just the perfect amount of bacon. It was beautiful and delicious. They also accommodated my coffee request for nonfat milk with almond. My Americano was delicious. My husband had tge b.o.b. (Breakfast on a bun) with no hoisin sauce and said it was delish, but he was definitely eyeing my tomatoes! Top marks to hub coffee house. Ideally located and great neighbourhood vibe."}
{"text":"I love this spot! Great coffee, friendly service and the food is simple but tasty. I've had a number of their sandwiches/meals, one of my favourites has to be the summer sausage with mustard and pickles. The BOB is also a great option for a quick breakfast and you can substitute the bacon for summer sausage! The owners of this establishment are really nice and they opened up a great pizza shop down the street!"}
{"text":"Visited the Hub for brunch, before heading back home in Montreal. We were looking for an inexpensive place near the apartment we rented, and we came across the Hub on Yelp which was a few minutes walk from where we were.  We both took the Egg Benedict. I'm a big fan of benedicts, and I also know how difficult it is to make a good one. Everything was perfect:  the egg was properly poached with a beautiful runny yolk, the peameal bacon was crispy, the multigrain bread was a nice change from the traditional English muffin, and the hollandaise was perfectly executed. The coffee was really good too.  In terms of service, it was very efficient and friendly.  A nice little gem in Dovercourt Village. Too bad we only discovered it on our last day in Toronto. We'll be back for sure next time we are in town :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast on a bun was a very delightful start in our first day of Toronto. Very nice service and a cozy little place! The best thing was THE COFFEE!! No offense, but for me as an European it's very hard to find a decent coffee in North America ;) this please had a great cappuccino!!"}
