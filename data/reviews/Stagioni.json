{"text":"This is a great gem in the South Side. Because of the location, parking can be an issue. We were seated upstairs and liked the decor. We started with the polenta with brussel sprouts which was outstanding and the mozzarella with was good, but not nearly as good as the polenta. I would pass on the mozzarella the next time we return. For our main course course, we had a half order of rabbit and the braciole - which I loved! It was so tender and the sauce was great. The issue was we also had ordered greens and beans, which did not appear with the meal. We thought maybe it was coming as a next course, until she gave us the dessert menu. When we asked about the greens and beans she looked confused that they had not been delivered. She apologized and had them packed to go. I was a bit surprised to find that they were still on the bill. For dessert I had the hazelnut mousse. We will return for sure."}
{"text":"Let's play a word association game.  When I say East Carson Street, what's the first thing you think of?  Bars? Yeah, sure.  There are so many bars and so little time that many have been known to awaken next to the porcelain throne in a fetal position.  Noise disturbances and fistfights you say? Hmm...perhaps I should just cut to the chase.  Yes, it's definitely true that East Carson Street has a reputation for excessive libation and poor decisions, but there's a diamond shining among the rough.  It's time to ignore the ruckus and treat yourself to the food and atmosphere that Stagioni has waiting for you.   Stagioni resides in the once Le Pommier, after relocating from their smaller locale in Bloomfield.  I rather adore the residential feel you get when opening the door.  A staircase, with a lovely wooden railing, will greet you before entering the cozy bar area.  You could dine there and enjoy watching the creation of an elegant cocktail, or you may have reserved one of the granite, tabletops in the dining room.     Once seated, you'll anticipate laying your eyes on the ever-changing, seasonal menu.  Some staple items consistently appear, like their delicate ricotta gnocchi.  But I prefer to take the road less traveled.  One dish that stood out recently was the...

{"text":"Outstanding!  Bravo!  Molto bene!  Went to Stagioni for a business dinner, and what a treat this little gem was!  The food and service was impeccable.  I love the small \"hole-in-the-wall\" feel.  You can tell that the chef is likely someone with a genuine Italian heritage who has this cuisine in their blood.  The authentic feel really shines.  I recommend everything on the menu.  When bringing wine, don't bring anything too abrasive with the reds.  Keep it balanced and fresh on the palate, as these will match best with the food."}
{"text":"I went to Stagioni (South Side location) with a group of eight people on a Wed night. My food was melt in your mouth, savor every bite, good. The house-made mozzarella and pasta were highlights. Everyone else at the table also raved about their meals. Nice drink selection. Good service. This may be my favorite restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful hidden gem in South Side. The food is creative and expertly prepared. They also have creative cocktails and affordable wines. It's a great place for a casual dinner or a special occasion!"}
{"text":"It was good, not great. Here's why: Our waiter forgot about us; the homemade mozzarella had no taste; my beet pasta had only beet water and no beets whatsoever even though it was labeled as beet pasta; the Caesar salad was not a true Caesar salad. We would not return."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Food was good, but the markup on the wine was absolutely ridiculous.  They charged $47 for a bottle of red wine that you can buy for $14 at the liquor store."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing all around.  Service was OUTSTANDING! Our waitress took so much time to explain the menu and make excellent suggestions.  Cocktails and wine were delicious.  We got the warm, mozzarella - it is a MUST!  The Polenta was also to die for - we got it with the grilled octopus (amazing!) and grilled shrimp.  By the time we got to our entrees, we were practically stuffed but there is always room for fresh pasta.  Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Had a party of 5 celebrating my wife's birthday.   Upon arrival we got lucky and got a spot on Carson right out front. Because this is in the 2100 block it's away from the nakama madness of parking.   Walked in the front door and was greeted by the hostess and was politely asked if we wanted to her to take our coats. How nice... Right!!!   We had our table upstairs and had plenty of room. It was a Friday and we had made a reservation the night before for 7:30. No open table but a call was easy and had no problem getting a table on such short notice.   Our server was awesome!! I don't say that often but he certainly knows the menu and more.   He was prompt and followed up all the time. Not to mention head had all 4 tables upstairs. Meaning he was regularly running the steps. Kudos to him.  I had a nice glass of Pinot noir. Loved it.   Started with the mozzarella and it was awesome. This was plenty to share for 5 and prob could have easily served 6.  The table shared the polenta and shrimp which was nice. Loved the polenta and table side service. I like the mini butcher clocks that they are served on.   We also had the Brussel sprouts which were awesome with the polenta.   My father had the Cesar salad which was perfectly dressed.   Wife had the butternut squash soup which easily served 2 and our sever was nice enough to split the portion up. Soup was so hot which is the way it should be. I can't remember the last time I had soup this warm. Loved it!!!!   I had the wild braised boar. Which by this time, I was getting full. But I couldn't let a bite go to waste. Finished it to the last bite and it was perfect.  All other dishes were shared except mine which I wouldn't give up a bite. Haha  Overall a perfect meal! Def will be back again.   Thanks again to our server! He was magnificent!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks back with my wife and daughter. Fantastic menu - the choose your own charcuterie menu is unique and appreciated. Service and food were exceptional. Prices were less than I expected and very reasonable for the quality of food they created. I will be back. If you are near the south side this is a must try."}
{"text":"WOW!  We had the tremendous fortune of trying Stagioni for the first time on May 1, one of the 3 days they were featuring their outstanding soup, Le Virtú.  This is a traditional soup from the Abruzzo region of Italy and it has 49 ingredients, marking the end of Winter and beginning of Spring.  It sounds like it might have too much going on but clearly the chef at Stagioni used a delicate hand because this soup was indescribably delicious.  Perhaps you're thinking the soup was an anomoly because the chef had worked so hard on it and it was featured?  NOPE!     We also shared, in this order:  1) house made, hand pulled mozzarella (with olives and prosciutto) 2) speck wrapped dates stuffed with fresh goat cheese 3) caesar salad 4) olive oil poached octopus w/creamy polenta 5) cavatelli w/peas, pistachios, mint and pancetta 6) Le Virtú soup  Every single dish was perfectly executed - and had layers upon layers of flavors.  After moving to Pittsburgh from Los Angeles we are beyond thrilled to have found such an amazing restaurant.  It rivals most Italian places in LA, like Osteria Mozza, which we loved.    Service was superb and the dining room was cozy and romantic.  Truly can't say enough nice things about Stagioni.  All hail the South Side!!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here last minute and nothing but great things to say about the food and the service . Our waiter Kurt was very informative and friendly ! We will def be back !"}
{"text":"I can't figure out why this place isn't packed! The menu is creative, food delicious and wine list is solid - great wines for good prices. My husband and I and another couple recently attended the Jamison lamb dinner - every course and wine pairing blew us away!  Cara is a great host and the service is knowledgeable and attentive."}
{"text":"Stagioni deserved another review from me. Came here with my boyfriend and his parents for dinner to celebrate his military commissioning. For appetizers, we ordered the olive oil poached octopus, roasted dates, sautéed mushrooms, and eggplant involtini. For entrees, we ordered the roasted chicken beast, rotolo, a pork dish (can't for the life of me remember the actual dish name) and ricotta gnocchi.  Everyone agreed that of the apps, the roasted dates, perfectly textured and packed with flavor, was the star of the show. However, the polenta (mushrooms) was to die for in my opinion. I always want to lick off every bit of it. No other restaurant I've tried makes/serves polenta the way Stagioni does.   I tell myself I'll get something different each time I go, but always come back to the ricotta gnocchi (please don't ever take this off the menu, guys!) We all thought the roasted chicken was amazing, but there was also nothing bad to say about the other two entrees. Our server - he didn't mention his name, otherwise I would here - was fantastic before, during and after our meal. I will miss Stagioni a great deal when I move away from Pittsburgh. But until then, I'll perpetually be finding excuses to come back!"}
{"text":"We decided to hit this place up after another restaurant didnt' honor our reservation.  This was quite a find!  I had the sausage gnocchi and it was delicious.  The minestrone soup was very flavorful as well.   I loved the intimate setting they had and the servers were wonderful!  I would recommend this place if you are in the mood for a delicious dinner and casual setting."}
{"text":"Because we went here with great friends, I think I'm ranking the experience better than I would have otherwise.  Our waitress was pretty much nonexistent and we were dying to order our wine!  We waited 15 minutes prior to anyone even greeting us.  We ordered two appetizers, the carpacio and their homemade mozzarella--both were delish!!  Hubby ordered the seafood brodetto, but was disappointed because the scallops were not on the dish.  It took forever for the waitress to check on us, so by the time she did hubby was already done with the dish.  When I told her about the scallops she just offered an apology.  I honestly expected her to offer him some then, or a dessert on the house.  Nothing.  I had a 1/2 portion of the green tomato pasta.  The sauce was good, but nothing that I couldn't make myself at home.  The homemade pasta was excellent!  The couple we were with said they loved their food:  duck breast and the daily fish dish.  We ordered their olive oil cake for dessert.  It was a couple crumbs on the plate, literally.  I think we had two pieces, the size of a 50 cent piece, with 4 little meringues, each the size of a quarter, and some limoncello gelato--tiny as well.  That, though, was a delight in the mouth!!  So, I couldn't wait to get here--wanted to go since they were in Bloomfield--but I have to say I was disappointed.  For $125 each couple, I wanted it to be a better experience."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday to celebrate our anniversary and we were one of only three occupied tables. The food was delicious. We tried the homemade mozzarella as an appetizer - it met our expectations and the the bread was amazing.   We ordered a $39 bottle of wine and were disappointed when it was delivered with a $12.99 price tag sticker still on it!  Boo.   I had the duck breast and it was one of the best I've ever had in Pittsburgh.  Nutella mousse as a dessert and French pressed coffee were a fantastic finish to the meal."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once so far, but I know for sure that I will be back. This place is definitely a hidden gem.   Typically, I kinda hate places that have super-limited menus, because that often means they also have a pretentious vibe. A vibe that says, \"We will only offer you 5 things, and you will eat them, and YOU WILL LIKE IT.\" However, Stagioni isn't that kinda place. Their menu is small and changes daily, but that's because they source local ingredients, and because the food really is that good. You will find something delectable on any given day.   My boyfriend and I went for breakfast. I'd read Yelpers' reviews mentioning the French Press coffee, so naturally, we had to get that. It lived up to the hype. Our waitress pressed it right at our table, and the coffee was utter perfection -- rich, bold, and delicious.   Their brunch menu had some items that fit the \"unch\" part of \"brunch\", but we went for the stuff that puts the \"br\" in \"brunch\", since it was 10am. I had the sausage, spicy potato hash, eggs, and toast, while my boyfriend had the same, only 'bacon' instead of sausage. They do note on the menu that the 'bacon' is actually prosciutto, just FYI.   Our meals came out quickly. They don't fill a plate up with a large quantity of food, and that's because it's all such high quality, so there's nothing to make up for, as I quickly discovered after the first bite. The sausage was incredible -- a nice, handformed patty, perfectly spiced. The potato hash, by the way, is only spicy if you happen to put a pepper seed in your mouth, which I was careful not to, because I don't love spicy food. It was perfect potato hash, though -- every tiny cube was perfectly soft, never undercooked, and there was fresh, chiffonade basil ribbons throughout, which added kinda an unexpectedly delish touch, as well as slivers of sauteed red pepper.   The eggs were over-easy, and they were delightful. It was obvious they were cooked in high quality olive oil, which lent a great flavor, and they were nicely seasoned with salt and pepper, too.   There was a half a piece of thick-cut Italian bread as the 'toast', and it was really, really good. Initially, I was like, \"That's it?\" but, turns out, this was the perfect amount of food. We didn't leave feeling overly stuffed, or unbuttoning our pants, as often happens at many Pittsburgh eateries (not that I'm knockin' that!). Each element of the meal was just fantastic, and they all worked together to create an extremely satisfying breakfast.   I will most definitely be back for dinner. I can't wait to see what else Stagioni has in store!"}
{"text":"Went to Stagioni last night, my first time , though it is literally right around the corner from my home. WOW!  This was a fabulous culinary experience, from beginning to end. All the naysayers who opine about the \"entertainment district\" problems of the SoSide don't realize that it's places just like this that make residents resolute in their love for this true walkaround, urban neighborhood. We began with a marvelous home made mozzarella appetizer, accompanied by wafer thin prosciutto and some sort of wonderful pickled peppers. Creamy and slightly sweet, this mozzarella was simply perfect. I chose a half order of the gnocchi with duck ragout as my second course. Savory with meltaway duck, this pasta dish is one of the best I've ever had...anywhere. A hearty dish, but not heavy in any way. How someone could refer to this gnocchi as heavy defies explanation. I could have stopped there and been completely content and my hunger sated, but as it was my first visit, I was compelled to order on! I chose the wild boar, plated over a bed of kale and polenta. Rich and fork tender, this was the perfect comfort food to counter the cold, snowy evening. The kale was a genius touch, it's mild crunch and pleasant bitterness was the perfect foil for the savory boar and dreamy/creamy polenta. I asked for the remainder in a to go bag, and this morning I'll enjoy it with runny eggs and cheesy grits for a fabulous breakfast. No dessert was had, so I can't comment there, but the superb food, more than adequate wine list, and efficient, but never interfering, service all came together for a simply remarkable meal. I love Stagioni, can't wait to return, and feel so lucky to be able to walk around the corner and feast on such sublime food."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot and was very disappointed. I ordered soup and my friend a salad besides the main course. Both salad/soup and main course arrived at the same time, but I got my food 5/10 minutes after my friend got his. The papardele was mediocre. The gnocchi, which was actually very light and real good, came on a ragout that was so dry looked like what I serve my dog. When the server asked how the food was, I answered \"It's ok\". There was no reply from her after that, and no inquiry as to why I left 2/3rd on my plate and didn't want to go box. It was a poor experience altogether. The wine was good. I'm sure it wasn't made there."}
{"text":"We bought beers, two appetizers, dinners, and two desserts, thus $40/person. Everything was super delicious, and the portions weren't ridiculous large like most restaurants. It was very cozy, friendly, and classy. They didn't try to rush you out of the restaurant either. Definitely a great find and will definitely go back if given the chance!"}
{"text":"If you don't like this place, then I don't like you. Amazing food, amazing service, amazing atmosphere.  Get the made to order mozz and everything else."}
{"text":"No more brunch! However, dinner is still exceptional! My husband I checked out the winter menu this past weekend. Wild boar, pork with figs, oh my! Tasty and warm! The food simply great!"}
{"text":"I returned as promised and still love Stagioni!  I was concerned about some recent reviews, but can tell you that dinner for 5 last night was fantastic.  The food and the service was flawless.  The other 4 dinners called me today to go over the dinner second by second and tell me how much they liked it.  (one is a chef....the  other 2 are grandmothers with a heavy 50's/60's food sensibility!)  We had the mozzarella and terrine.  Beet, spinach and brussel sprout salads, and beans and greens.   All were delisious and perfectly made.  The mozzarella plate was fantastic!  We had gnocchi and agniolotti as pasta courses...It was nice to have the option for 1/2 size portions!  MAins were Strip Steak, Boar, and sausage meetballs.  Each was great!  I would have given a 5 star, but I was baffled by the lack of a chicken and shell fish main course on the menu.  The decor is very nice in the restaraunt, but felt dinging because the light were too bright.  Very soft music would have been nice too.  Yes, I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Stellar all around experience. Amazing food and great beer pairing possibilities thanks to well discerned beer list that includes Italian crafts. Beautiful layout and decor. Friendly, competent service. Polished: from bar, to dining room, to bathroom. A winner! Happy Birthday to me!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a good meal late on a Saturday PM.   Surprisingly not crowded, given the reviews, but traffic picked up a bit later in the evening.   Service was outstanding - the waiter explained dishes well, inquired in-depth about food allergies in response to a question about a specific ingredient, and paced the meal perfectly.   Appetizer of the fresh mozzarella with tomatoes was great.   Food was well-prepared, portions were adequate if not a bit on the small side.    Worth a trip."}
{"text":"Went to Stagioni after a long wait since reading about it in Pittsburgh Magazine as one of the top restaurants in the city.  I made a reservation for four (my wife, daughter of 13 , son of 14, and me) at 6:00pm. I'll start by saying the food and service were excellent.  The atmosphere was surprisingly subdued for a Saturday night at 6 on the Southside the night before a home Steelers game. It was like a funeral home in there when we first walked in and didn't liven up at all by around 7 when we left.  I wasn't expecting DisneyWorld but I was expecting more tables to be full and a little more \"restaurant noise\".  It was very quiet so our dinner conversation was very quiet too to match the ambiance. A little uncomfortable for a kid from an Irish-Italian family from \"Jersey\", if you know what I mean.   The food, like I said, was excellent. We started with the fresh mozzarella and heirloom tomato dish (apparently so does almost everybody) and it was fantastic. The cheese is served warm (but not melted) over the tomatoes and enhanced by a balsamic reduction and a touch of sea salt.  For dinner, my wife and daughter are not as adventurous as my son and me, so they got the linguine and the gnocchi, respectively, with a house made tomato sauce they have at the ready for just such customers. A great idea and they both loved the fresh made pasta.  My son also had the gnocchi but had it the way the chef planned on serving it, crumbled Italian sausage and bitter greens in an olive oil based white wine sauce. He loved it and actually said the greens were the best part for him! What!?!  I had the fettuccini in a brown butter sauce with lobster meat. The fresh pasta was outstanding, the sauce had a TON of flavor and complimented the lobster really well.  I forgot to mention the gnocchi was a ricotta based and not potato, great move and done perfectly. Our server was very nice and attentive. She got us what we wanted in a timely fashion, water, bread (Italian, sourdough or ciabatta), wine for us and soda for the kids.  All things considered, I would go back for the food and service but not the atmosphere.  The chef seems bold and adventurous and changes the menu often, so we were told. I'll have to go back to find out..."}
{"text":"In town from CA and wanted some true authentic Italian... thinking we would stumble in to a traditional \"red checkered tablecloth\" kind of place...we were pleasantly surprised. Tucked in South Side, this is a gem! So quaint and vintage cool! Starting with some unbelievable cocktails...some traditional and some with a \"twist\"..really great. Our beyond amazing waiter, Brian (almost positive that was his name!) was so helpful with suggestions and choices, he was just the perfect blend of attentive and professional! Had to try the greens and beans for an appetizer as it was a childhood favorite of mine....soooo good! And can we talk about the bread!!!! We  were a party of 5, so enjoyed a little bit of everything...from tuna to meatballs to pasta and it was all exceptional!!!"}
{"text":"My first experience at this restaurant was a deal maker. From the road, this restaurant doesn't have any kind of curb appeal.  It looks similar to surrounding storefronts and didn't particularly stand out, thank goodness for Yelp or I would have never even heard of this place.    Initially, my family and I were trying to figure out where we wanted to go for dinner.  We came up with a few options and decided that we'd think about it while taking some time to go explore the strip.  After walking through the macaroni co, Mancini's and a few other Italian style grocers and delis, we decided on Italian food.  We called for reservations and were disappointed to find out that they were completely booked until 9PM.  We abandoned hope and started to talk about where else we could go.  After a few minutes we received a call back from the restaurant informing us that they had a cancellation.  We appreciated the extra effort of the staff to call us back.  I was surprised to see that the menu was devoid of familiar Italian favorites such as spaghetti, lasagna etc...  Don't let this deter you unless you are dead-set on the typical American-Italian cuisine!  We decided to share all of the pasta dishes on the menu and one entree.  It is a limited menu but everything on it is executed perfectly.  Gnocchi with spicy sausage-rapini ragout, freshly grated parmesan This was my favorite by far.  The gnocchi melted away in my mouth and the flavors were decadent without being overpowering.  Highly recommended.  Cavatelli with brown butter, butternut squash and sage This was a sweeter dish, very rich and flavorful.  It is definitely worth trying.  Fettuccine with a mushroom sauce and leeks Mushroom lovers will enjoy this dish.    Beef Braciole This was the only entree we tried and everything about it was delicious.  The beef was cooked perfectly and was extremely tender.  Everything we had was outstanding.  The service was excellent.  The weight staff was friendly and engaging.  I will definitely be coming back and recommending this place to everyone I know!  Bring a bottle of wine to share with your friends and enjoy a first class authentic Italian meal.   ***side note*** according to the website this was the last night for the restaurant in Bloomfield location and they will be opening a new location on E. Carson St."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the portions were way too small. I ordered the large cavatelli for $20 and left hungry. About 6-8 ounces of pasta and an adequate amount of sauce. The server kept bring room temperature water to us. Is ice at a premium in Pittsburgh ? Won't go back or recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, my husband loves the fish here and I can't get enough of the duck, great for either special occasions or just a weeknight dinner. Highly recommend; go next door to Acacia for drinks first."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh!! Spot on Italian.  The homemade mozzarella is amazing.  Great cocktails and engaging staff.   Check out their Sunday suppers."}
{"text":"What a great dinner!! A group of 7 of us went there to celebrate my birthday, so of course,  I was predisposed to have a great time - but the food delivered!  We had appetizers of Salted Cod fritters, the Mozzarella appetizer.  Everyone had various entrées - which everyone loved!  I had the PEI Mussels with Fettuccini and saffron cream.  The rich sauce was delicious and complemented the mussels perfectly.  I'm so angry because in the post-dinner-celebration my leftovers got lost.  Or stolen, now that I think about it, most likely stolen.  Others at the table had the Duck breast as well as the Gnocchi.  I sampled both and they were great.  For dessert we ordered a couple of options, but the Nutella Mousse sticks out as amazing.  It is BYOB, making a very affordable DELICIOUS meal.  I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I went there anticipating Italian food with veal dishes, pastas, etc.  The menu is very limited 3 pasta dishes and 6 entrees.  They were out of two of the dishes but the menu choices were unappealing and portions were very small.  The duck came basically with sliced duck on a plate and nothing else.  I had appetizers for dinner. The service was pleasant; however, the waitress took our drink and dinner orders together.  Bread was cold.  Waitress didn't repour the oil for the bread.  Took a while to get checks.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Always spot on. Like many people before me, and many after will suggest, GET THE MOZZARELLA! Freshly made mozzarella ball with olive oil, balsamic, and sea salt on top and olives, roasted red peppers, and prosciutto on the side. Delicious... My wife and I each usually order a pasta dish and we share polenta.  The pasta is handmade, great texture and bite. The sauces compliment it perfectly. Polenta is creamy goodness and you can choose an ingredient to go with it (we have been known to go with the charred octopus normally) Haven't had a bad plate here."}
{"text":"We were looking for a step outside of traditional Italian, and we found it. We ordered the fresh mozzarella and had never had anything like it. It looked like my daughters slime but tasted amazing! I also ordered the fresh Brussels sprout salad. I've never had raw Brussels sprouts and was delightfully surprised at the flavor. There were toasted hazelnuts and dates I believe, which made for a complimentary flavor. Finally, we got two different kinds of gnocchi and a pasta with boar's meat. Overall it was excellent!"}
{"text":"Stagioni has managed to stay under the radar and I don't know how that is possible. Their food, atmosphere and service are all top-notch. My husband and I have been here for both brunch and dinner and Stagioni has never disappointed. The restaurant has such character and has quite the European look to its decor. It's intimate, quiet and perfect for a romantic date. For brunch, we've tried the spicy hash and pistachio waffle. However, after a quick look at their site, I'm not sure if they offer brunch anymore. At our most recent visit for dinner, we tried the grilled octopus polenta, the cioppino and the roasted chicken breast. The polenta was definitely the star of the show. They pour the polenta on the board right in front of you. The cioppino was in a mild tomato sauce and the grilled bread was perfect for soaking up the broth. The roasted chicken breast was moist, melt in your mouth and perfectly seasoned with garlic and herbs.   With our check, there was a note and we saw that they hold large Sunday dinners on the first Sunday of every month where they have 3 tables of 18 and they serve up dinner family style for $40-$50 per person. It's a great idea to get people, including strangers, to dine and socialize together this way. Can't wait to try their Sunday dinner!"}
{"text":"sunday brunch is grand.  the food's always good, waitresses and such are lovely... the menu changes often."}
{"text":"We were able to get day-of reservations for a Friday night at 8:30pm.  The restaurant was small, tastefully decorated and brighter than your average evening fine dining restaurant.  We got: -two glasses of Cabernet- great wine  -fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes.  Delicious with a little coarse salt and balsamic -chopped salad with a little cheese, salami and a very tasty vinaigrette.  Even though I am not much of a salad person, it was great and tasted very fresh -salad with balsamic dressing - wasn't as good as the chopped salad, but still quite good -half order of fresh pasta with Parmesan, zucchini and tomatoes -the perfect size for a lighter meal- I ate all of it.  I worried the pasta would be too heavy for a late dinner, but it was perfect in the smaller portion -skirt steak- this was my boyfriend's third dish with balsamic.  Perhaps by that time he had had enough balsamic, but it wasn't stellar.  The meat was cooked perfectly and the portion was generous -tiramisu- tasty! -French press coffee and cappuccino- very good as well, fresh   Overall, it was an excellent meal and the smaller portions allowed us to try many different things on the menu.  Without a doubt, we will be back as the menu changes seasonally/weekly.  The menu was smaller so you could tell how the chefs spent time curating each dish and picking items in season."}
{"text":"Disappointing dining experience. Loud environment, mediocre service, and only ok food with birdlike servings. Overrated and expensive for the ho hum experience. Much better places to eat along E. Carson Street."}
{"text":"Relatively new restaurant that we tried for the first time last night. The four of us shared their homemade mozarella cheese with red peppers and prosciutto appetizer that was very tasty.   I believe all of their pasta is homemade. My wife and I both had the fettucine with peas, pancetta and bread crumbs in a cream sauce. We both really liked the dish, but the portions were huge and we brought home enough for another dinner. I had the roasted beet salad with gorgonzola, which was excellent and was large enough to share.   One of our dinner mates had the pork loin that he said was nothing special. His date had the ravioli that must have pretty good since it disappeared from her plate.   We shared a lemon tart and a Nutella mousse.....both very good.   Stagioni is BYOB, which made the evening's bill quite reasonable! The waitstaff were all very efficient and unobtrusive. Well done!!  You're probably wondering why I only gave it 2 stars. I would have given it 3.5 except for two things......the noise level was exceedingly high, over 90 decibels most of the time with a peak of 105 after a noisy group joined the room. Sorry but the dining experience is ruined when it gets this loud.   Second problem is the single door entry that let chilly air blow over the every time it was opened. Why can't Pittsburgh restaurants use those temporary exterior vestibules like they do in NYC?  We will go back again because of the food and hope for a warm evening and a soft spoken crowd."}
{"text":"Our daughter suggested Stagioni for dinner on Friday night.  From the very beginning with the mozzarella appetizer we knew this restaurant was special.  Main courses were all delicious and the desserts were better than anything we have ever tasted.  My husband and I live in Chicago and I wish I could take this restaurant back with us.    Great service and great food.  A wonderful treat before we head back to Chicago."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. For the quality the prices are reasonable. Dishes are creative but have a nice comfort feel. The must try is the fresh mozzarella."}
{"text":"First off, this is not a BYOB restaurant as mentioned by another reviewer.  The dining area is small but was not crowded so that was okay.  We started off with the mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes - wonderful!  We were served a small dish of rosemary infused olive oil and a choice of three different breads (ciabata, Italian and one other).  Oddly they are somewhat stingy with the bread, giving you only one half slice of your choice.  They will give you more if you ask but they don't offer.  We had a lot of olive oil left in the dish - however, it was really good!   Hubby had the Lobster Fettucine and I had the green tomato Linguine.  We both ordered the half portion and there was plenty.  Both were to our liking.  I should mention that the pasta is made there and was very good.  We opted out of dessert but now I'm regretting it.  We shared a bottle of Pinot Noir and overall had a delicious experience.  One other odd note, the owner or manager (not sure his role) spent his time hovering in the doorway wathcing people eat.  He didn't seem to have anything to do other than listen in on coversations and watch people.  It was a little unnerving."}
{"text":"This is REALLY great Tuscan food.  We ordered for the table, great options are: ricotta gnocchi, figs, polenta and meatballs.  Good cocktails and very cozy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Aw ma-an.  I was really looking forward to coming here.  First of all, it was one of my best boo's birthdays and 2. I was in the mood for what looked to be an awesome menu.  While the company was AH-MAZING (Happy Birthday Rachel!), the service and food were...not.  I was the first to arrive and was cheerfully-enough greeted by the hostess, who I later discovered to be the owner.  Our server-to-be showed me to our lovely table by the window and I was prepped for a delicious experience.  The other guests arrived shortly thereafter and our chatter commenced.    A few things to start - The atmosphere is lovely.  You feel like you're in a parlor setting - very homey and pretty.  The wine took a while to come out, but the hostess/bartender/owner was manning the bar alone so this was completely understandable.  The bread basket was beautiful, but the \"can't be bothered\" attitude with which it was served by our server was not as delightful.    Our food didn't take long at all, but at first bite I knew it was nothing special.  I ordered Arctic Char (a salmon-like fish as the server correctly informed me).  A note: I ordered the Char without the molasses, so I'm aware that this part of the flavoring was missing.  In any case - and even as someone who prefers their meat to arrive kicking and screaming - the fish was not done as well as it should've been. It walked that line between \"is it warm?\" or \" is it rare;\" fine for me usually, though I feel the flavor would've been more complete had it lingered a little longer in the cooking process.  It was complemented by an almost non-existent carrot puree (delicious, but a few more dollops would have sufficed) and a few lentils.  Again - just nothing special.  I'd just as soon taste this type of fish preparation at Eat 'n Park (harsh, I know), and would've paid far less than $21 - a more-than-fair price for fresh fish when prepared correctly.  My fellow birthday partiers ordered pasta; none of which looked (or tasted since I nibbled a couple of bites) like anything special.   The bottom line is this: with an inviting atmosphere and the best company one can have, I'm not tough to please in a restaurant...even with less-than-stellar food.  If I throw $30 out the window, I don't really care (don't spread that around).  But, what I'm NOT a fan of at all, is service with an attitude (unless it's the good kind).  Maybe our server was having a bad day. Maybe we were over-friendly (we DID get one marked giggle out of him).  Whatever the case may have been, I really wish he would've taken a deep breath before work that day and gone at it with a smile.  A smile can make all the difference.    I'll try anything twice, so I'm not saying I'll never go back.  I'm just a little burned given that I can never replace a 30th birthday meal for one of my besties.  Here's to 31!"}
{"text":"I loved my experience at Stagioni this past weekend, and everyone in the party agreed! I highly recommend!  The dining room was nice and quiet with warm lighting and floral accents. We asked for cocktail recommendations, and the server did a nice job of asking about our preferences and recommending appropriate options.   We decided to go heavy on the appetizers, as there were so many delicious options. This was definitely a good choice! The made to order mozzarella was fresh and creamy. My first bite of the cheese alone was good, but once I added some of the fresh salt and swirled it around in balsamic, it was perfect! The roasted brussel sprout salad was a surprise - we all expected full brussel sprouts - but in a good way! It was loaded with parmesan cheese, and the hazelnuts were a really nice touch. The roasted figs stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon were definitely our favorite appetizer - we fought over who was going to have the last one!  We also shared a pizza and two pasta dishes.The Artichoke etc. pizza had the perfect amount of cheese with a deliciously crisp crust. I love gnocchi but never had it with ricotta - will definitely try that again! The pappardelle was cooked perfectly al dente and had a nice orange flavor. The port currants were an excellent addition.   Our sever was very attentive and, even though we were the last table in the dining room, we never felt rushed to leave. Excellent all around experience."}
{"text":"If your looking for a delicious Tiramisu and a good pasta, this is the right place. :) I also recommend their polenta (corn cream) with mushroom.  I had cod last time and the plate was beautiful but the fish itself it was savourless.  Inside looks like a house and I really like this because it feels more cozy."}
{"text":"I was impressed in every way by my visit to Stagioni.  We were warmly greeted by our waiter, and he informed us of a $20 wine special (10 bottles to choose from for $20 on Wednesday nights).    For our first course, the Butternut Squash Soup with pomegranate and molasses was well balanced and nuanced.  I also highly recommend the Escarole with  Gorgonzola, hazelnuts, and red wine vinaigrette.  They used an imported Gorgonzola that was flavorful and the roasted hazelnuts were a distinctive addition.  For my main course, I enjoyed the Cavatelli with eggplant, tomato, basil, and Parmesan.  Delicious!  My friend had the Fettucini with green tomato sauce, also remarkable.  Both used artisan pasta, very fresh and of perfect consistency.  For dessert, we split a Tiramisù, which was very good.  The decor was impressive, and we enjoyed a relaxed conversation.  The service was impeccable.  Excellent value, especially given the wine special."}
{"text":"I'm disappointingly going to have to go with just two stars on this one. Not to say the food wasn't good - but the overall experience - not so good.  The couple next to us said it perfectly: \"I feel like we're in someones living room\".  We sat upstairs and there was only faint, very faint, music playing and everyone was just - whispering. Dining to me is talking, laughing, drinking, eating - sharing stories and enjoying each others company. The stuffy six-inch-voice atmosphere might be appealing to some, but definitely not my cup of tea.   But, as per usual, we did our best to make the most of it. Everything on the menu looked appetizing, so it was hard to decide. We decided to share some appetizers so that we could try a few different things. We went with light fare, ordered the salumi and cheese plate, as well as a beet salad to share. We also got a radicchio and endive salad - which was dressed with a very flavorful and tasty vinaigrette. We were happy with our dishes.  The service however, was...well...not so great. I wasn't drinking this evening, so I asked the waitress if the bartender could make me some sort of 'mocktail' - she said she would check - I thought she would come back with some options - instead she came back with a very tall glass of fruit juice...not what I was looking for. I then just asked for a sparkling water in a wine glass. We told her we were going to be taking our time and not to hurry, but when we were clearly waiting on another plate, we had to ask her when our salads were coming. My friend also had to order, and then remind after 10 minutes, about her second glass of wine.   So, after reading such great reviews, my experience wasn't exactly what I had hoped for or expected..."}
{"text":"Very very good. The food was amazing and the ambiance is cool. I am just too spoiled with all the food joints in Pittsburgh to give it 5 stars. It absolutely deserves a try. Get the roman gnocchi, weird take on it but really good."}
{"text":"When there for my friends birthday with a large group. They were really accommodating. The pastas were all good and home made, and the polenta was delicious. Overall the food was great, and I'm surprised this place doesn't have more hype around it.   The Brussels sprout salad was really good, although not aesthetically pleasing. I gave 4 stars not 5 because some pastas were better than others. The chestnut agnolotti was amazing. I didn't expect to like a sweet pasta but it was very well done. The gnocchi was also really good but quite dense. The pappardelle noodles were good but the sauce was underwhelming. I do also like that they let you order half portions so you can order two pastas instead of one!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Pittsburgh for a wedding recently and had dinner one night at Stagioni, it was fabulous! While the menu seemed simple and straightforward, I can say that the food was most definitely not! Our server (Emily I think) was fantastic, taking time to explain the menu and how some items are made. We started with the home-made mozzarella and prosciutto and squash blossom appetizers. Be warned, the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer is more than enough for two people, and it was delicious. I am normally not a squash fan, but theirs was really good, with pine-nuts and a ricotta \"foam.\"  After those great appetizers, my wife opted for the half portion of fettuccine with lobster, which had a great brown butter sauce and BIG chunks of lobster meat. I had the wild boar ribs (recommended by Emily). I am a big wild boar fan but had never tried the ribs until now; they were very similar to beef ribs, but more more meat and flavor. For dessert (no idea how we fit dessert in) we had the olive oil pound cake with vanilla-fennell gelato, which again was fantastic.  Overall it was a great dining experience, we really enjoyed the ambiance and our server. We would definitely recommend it to friends, and will be visiting again on our next trip to the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!  Very cute new building in South Side, service was fantastic, and the food is delicious. The homemade mozzarella and chop salad were some of the best I've ever had. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, Stagioni is great. We went for the first time this weekend and it was fantastic. Food, drinks, service, ambiance - everything was lovely. They have an extensive list of wine by the glass and bottle as well as cocktails. My husband ordered the \"new fashioned\" - like an old fashioned but with rye whiskey instead of bourbon. He reports it was delicious. For an appetizer we ordered the made to order mozzarella (thanks, previous Yelp reviews for the rec!) Y'all, they literally make this cheese in house right when you order it. It came sprinkled with sea salt on a platter with olive oil, balsamic, prosciutto, roasted peppers and olives, as well as a basket of crusty bread. That cheese on that bread dipped in some olive oil and balsamic was just heavenly. I ate about five thousand pieces. (They also pasteurize it in house, just in case anyone else needs to know.) I also ordered a Bibb salad, which came with butter lettuce, hard boiled eggs, beets, and this delicious tarragon vinaigrette. It was a great mix of crunchy, bitter and sweet and I loved it. For the entrees, you can order a half portion of pasta for $10 or a full portion for $20. The half portion was clutch for me, having already gorged myself on bread and cheese. I will say that the menu was rather confusing and I had a lot of questions for the server, BUT he knew the answers to everything I asked and was super professional and helpful. I ordered the ricotta gnocchi and it was excellent. It came in a ragout sauce of greens and sausage, which sounds kind of weird, but it was great and added the perfect balance to the sweetness of the ricotta cheese. The half portion was a perfect size as well. My dining companions had the meatball, the pappardelle, and the pici and everyone loved their meals. We ordered dessert because we were celebrating a birthday and I am so glad we did. Our server recommended the semifreddo and it was AMAZING. Like, one of the best desserts I have ever had. It is a frozen mousse which tastes like ice cream and chocolate mousse at the same time. It was topped with fudge and came drizzled with warm chocolate sauce and nuts to go with. OMG. I could not stop eating it. The server even brought out a special big portion with a candle for my husband for his birthday without us asking - he'd just heard us mention it was his birthday. Throughout the meal the service was excellent - attentive, prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. I will say this place is on the pricier side, so it will be a special occasion place for us, but I totally can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The bummer about writing this review is that the food really was decent. Unfortunately, the service was a total bust. I recently moved to Pittsburgh and have been talking it up to friends and relatives who have thought I'm crazy for choosing to move here. In short, the service at Stagioni wrecked my PR efforts. First, when I walked in, a waiter looked me up and down and then walked away without even saying \"hello\", let alone \"someone will be with you shortly\". Once we were seated, the time between our being seated and finally receiving drinks was about 25 minutes. More than enough time to think you've been completely forgotten. When the time to order a second drink came around, another excessively long period followed by a bizarrely different version of the same drink I ordered the first time ensued. When I raised to the wait staff that the second drink tasted quite different, the bar tender arrived in .1 seconds to argue about it. When the food arrived, I was relieved, as it was very flavorful and well-executed for Italian fare. It's really too bad that the service pissed me off so much that I couldn't enjoy the food and couldn't wait to leave sans coffee or dessert."}
{"text":"Portions small. Beans and Greens was so tough that it almost choked us. Salads and sides separate.  Food is tasty just don't go there very hungry."}
{"text":"Brunch review: On a recent weekend, we made reservations at Stagioni for brunch with the girls. We were seated at a table in the bar section. The restaurant seems to be broken up into several rooms, most likely due To being located in what used to be someone's house. We were instructed to go upstairs to use a bathroom. After reviewing the brunch menu, I noticed it was a quite heavy on egg/savory dishes. In fact, there was only one sweet brunch option, a pistachio waffle with a cherry sauce and whipped cream. I ordered an OJ and the waffle. We then had plenty of time to catch up as our order took over half an hour. In total, we were there for over a hour and a half. Translation: service was very slow. As for the waffle, I enjoyed the slight pistachio flavor and the cherry sauce was great but, it was not heavy enough to sit on top of the waffle. It was easy absorbed into the waffle leaving a mushy center. All in all, I was not impressed with the food or service. I also would like to see more sweet brunch options."}
{"text":"We were satisfied with our dinner at Stagioni last night, but not overjoyed. We shared the roasted fig appetizer and ordered different pasta dishes for entres. Everything was very good, and we particularly liked the option to get a half size pasta, since restaurants always give you enough pasta for two hungry cowboys. I had room for desert, an unremarkable tiramisu. We had a decent bottle of California Chardonnay, which was fairly priced. The wine list was a little strange for an Italian restaurant, with many French bottles; do they still have inventory left from Le Pommier? The menu was sparse, with just a couple of meet, fish, and pasta choices, and only a few deserts. We like the intimate dining room, but the server was a little too enthusiastic about up-selling us. Made me think of Olive Garden. Overall, an okay experience, and we'll return, but it's not a must-do kind of place."}
{"text":"Strong in every regard: service, atmosphere, menu, presentation, food quality, preparation, taste. I recommend the house-made mozzarella and prosciutto. The hangar steak was a winner. Our server was a star: down-to-Earth, professional, attentive, easy-going.  The calm atmosphere in the upstairs dining room is a refuge. It was a delightful experience. I strongly recommend Stagioni. A Pittsburgh star."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate with my family, and this isn't a place that you'd go every weekend. The food is very different, but in an excellent way. It was very delicious, and the wine selection was vast. The waiter was always making sure that our food was up to par, and answered any question we had. The ambiance is very trendy and cozy, and the music playing was very good as well. I'll definitely be coming here again! Yum!"}
{"text":"I don't know if we would have made it into here if they hadn't been open on Sundays but I'm so glad we did. Our waiter was one of the best servers I have ever had. So knowledgeable about everything on the menu and was able to give us other awesome recommendations for after-dinner drinks.   My husband and I both really enjoyed our cocktails- he had the Bramble On and I had the Special Tea. We tried the house made mozzarella, the greens and beans, the gnocchi and the cavatelli. I'm not going to get into the details but seriously, everything was phenomenal and the prices were awesome for the portions. It's a shame I've missed out on this place for the past few years of visiting Pittsburgh but we will definitely be back next time we visit."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times (dinner and brunch) and we have always enjoyed ourselves!  I was here recently for dinner during the week. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful with ordering. For starters we had the octopus polenta and the butternut squash arancini. Both were very delicious! and would highly recommend (if you're not into octopus, definitely try a different polenta). I really enjoyed the pesto that came with the arancini!  For our meals we had the gnocchi and the meatballs. I order the smaller portion of the gnocchi and it was the perfect size (with some leftovers). Would recommend both!   I would definitely check this place out if you are looking for some fine dining in the south side!"}
{"text":"Meh... Nothing really to brag about here.    I really wanted to believe the good reviews and ignore the bad ones.  This was recommended by a friend who always steers us right.  I took my mother and fiancée here for their birthdays that are coincidently in the same week.  Both wished they ordered what I had (scallops) which means they were not impressed with what they had, Salt cod and Gnocchi.  I have to admit those scallops were delicious but felt the need to pass out some food.  Both loved the purée.  The beets were tasty but the purée added nothing special.  The grilled shrimp polenta was good but I wanted to like it more than I did.  The first bite had a smoky flavor but the rest of the shrimp were cold and did not fulfill the expectation.  Nothing too special here either.  The stuffed banana peppers were also tasty but my home recipe is comparable if not better (I'm not bragging... just sayin').  The gnocchi came out under cooked and you could taste it.  Some of the warm and cold didn't work for me.  For example, warm peppers topped with cold cheese?  Hot polenta and cold romesco sauce?  Which is what made the shrimp cold.  Overall, most of the food lacked flavor.  That's not something you want to hear when considering Italian cooking.  The expectation is usually for your meal to be full of flavor.  Even the table bread was served with just olive oil.  Usually there's a nice balsamic vinaigrette or some bread seasoning in the oil.      I don't think we will come back.  There are just too many other places worth going.  I'm not afraid to pay a the price for a great meal, but with price comes an expectation. There price of our meals did not match the quality.  They seemed like a restaurant trying to stand in a class of cooking they don't really belong.  Sorry... :/ But it's true."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. Wonderful, friendly staff and delicious food. Start d with the homemade mozzarella, and by homemade, I mean they make it when you order it so it comes out warm. It was outstanding. The rest of the meal was equally scrumptious, especially the Nutella mousse. Bonus feature. They are open on Sunday nights, which seemed to be rare for an Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I go here for the fresh mozzarella. It is honestly to die for. Order that and a half dish of pasta and you are all set. The cocktails are pretty yummy as well."}
{"text":"First off, I had never heard of this restaurant until a friend suggested we have our quarterly double dinner date here.   With no hype and limited expectations, I wasn't sure what I was in for.  The good news?   What I was in for was a good thing.  First off, our waiter was attentive and fabulous.  He was more of a foodie than we were!  I ordered the made to order mozzarella app which was a healthy size with very fresh, ripe heirloom tomatoes and the mozzarella was served warm.  We followed that up with their signature polenta and opted for the version with marinated roasted red peppers.  It wasn't out of this world but it was tasty.   The polenta was hot and was poured on a wooden board with the whole roasted red pepper which was cold.  I would have preferred the roasted red peppers warm/hot.   For dinner, I had the seasonal special, a cheese-filled ravioli type pasta in an apple and brown butter sauce.  Fabulous!   What I didn't love was the dessert menu.  Not a great selection.  I'll also note that they have a full wine list but  you can bring your own and pay a $15 corkage fee.   The restaurant is worth a try but it is on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with about 15 tables, reservations recommended. Started with the made to order mozzarella platter and the butternut squash arrancini. Both were good but there are so many small plates that I would venture to try something else next time. The small pasta plates are large enough to order as your meal if you also order an appetizer. We had the ricotta gnocchi and the wild boar papardelle. The papardelle is made with an orange gremolata so if you're not into orange or a bite of sweet, I would not get this. For dessert, we ordered the pistachio semifredo which was to die for an the tiramisu. With a bottle of red wine, the menu before tip was $116."}
{"text":"5 stars because this place deserves it!  I had been here several times before this weekend, but I didn't know if I liked it to much because of the company or the wine, but it's clear that the food is amazing! We started off with the fresh made mozzarella. This is a steal! $12 for a heaping mound of prosciutto, olives, roasted red peppers, and a delicious ball of mozzarella topped with coarse salt, EVOO, and balsamic. I literally have dreams about this dish. For the next course we ordered the octopus polenta. The octopus was grilled and tender and served with a creamy polenta and a tasty romesco sauce. Delightful. For the final course, we order the rolto. It's like they take a slice of lasagna and bake it in a shallow dish so every part is like the crispy corner of a traditional lasagna. So good. I definitely recommend eating there. I will definitely be trying their multi course dinner on an upcoming Sunday."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Stagioni is a place we must have passed countless times without noticing, on a Sunday morning we were looking for a nice alternative to a greasy-eggs brunch we usually find ourselves eating. We noticed Stagioni's reviews all touting the food, and looking at the menu they serve seasonal, local, and organic food wherever possible. Also, the dinner menu changes daily, it seems, which I think is a great way to tell that you're getting fresh, high quality food. Seeing that this place was near us and served Brunch until 2, we called ahead to put our names in and headed over.   Arriving at about 1pm, we felt slightly silly having put our name in - the restaurant was totally empty. The walls were nicely decorated, including some art made out of wine-corks, and a bright yellow ceiling. There are about 10 tables inside and 2 outdoor seats and we took our pick. By the end of the meal, though, the restaurant was totally packed.  We ordered a french press($3!), fettucini($11), 'eggs in purgatory' - Eggs cooked in marinara sauce over polenta($9), and the spicy potato hash side($3). Our waitress was friendly, and to echo another reviewer perfectly attentive - She was never intrusive, but even while single-handedly managing every table in the restaurant she was never gone too long.  Our food came quickly, perfectly portioned for brunch (My girlfriend decided she liked my fettucini too much to let me eat it, so I wound up eating half the fettucini and a little more than half of the eggs and was stuffed) and the flavors were outrageously good. The pasta was fresh, the polenta smooth, the marinara having a rich tomato flavor with fresh herbs. The potatoes were definitely my favorite thing though - just a hint of spice from red pepper flakes, fried with onions and some strips of red pepper to add a hint of sweetness. I could have eaten them as a meal alone.  They are BYOB, but half way through the meal our server came out to us and offered us complimentary mimosas. Absolutely! I'm not sure what prompted this - and as they don't have a license they can only give alcohol, not sell it - but it was an amazing touch on an already amazing meal. I am so excited to have this nearby, I'm already planning when I can go back. And the menu changes so often, I doubt I'll ever get bored of it. For anyone keeping track, we got 2 entrees, a french press, a side, and 2 mimosas for $32 after tip.  They were also recently featured in Pittsburgh Magazine's 25 best restaurants. Totally deserved."}
{"text":"I was skeptical since I wasn't in a fancy dinner mood, but the pizza was very good and the waitstaff was quite cordial. I admit, I prefer a selection of domestic beer, which they didn't have, but overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The staff is friendly and the food is very well executed and reasonably priced for fine dining.   I have eaten hear multiple times and recommend the homemade mozzarella and one of the great polenta dishes, but you really can't go wrong with their menu."}
{"text":"It was okay, but not great. Tried both the potato and ricotta gnocchi, the scallops, the duck, and the fresh mozzarella plate. They were all a bit bland.  Also, the menu was awfully limited and they actually don't have very many pasta options for an Italian joint.   For the price, I'd pass."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner! My husband and I were in Pittsburgh for our daughters Pitt orientation and headed to the South Side on a recommendation for dinner. We wandered around until we thought this place looked good. What a great find!  Homemade mozzarella ( recommended by Yelp!) was perfect and beet salad was delicious. Cavatelli  was good but not out of this world. My husband had the pork chop which was delicious. The service was friendly and attentive, and plates cleared and water filled.  I would absolutely dine here again when I come to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I checked out their menu before going and wasn't sure what to expect as they have limited choices on their menu but didn't leave disappointed!  Service was absolutely amazing. Our waitress explained the menu, how they made their house mozzarella & helped make accommodations for those who were gluten free at the table. We started with homemade mozzarella (a must!!) & greens and beans. Both were spectacular. I got the fluke which was served in a mild broth over wild rice and shrimp. Absolutely delicious. Also, shared an array of desserts (butterscotch pudding, pana cotta).  Waitress explained they switch up menu quite frequently and try to bring in as much local produce and game as possible. I will definitely be going back the next time they change up the menu."}
{"text":"I have to say that I usually find Italian restaurants boring and bland. Being of Italian heritage myself, I am spoiled into only liking my home cooking. However, my trip to this restaurant last night really impressed me. It looked like a well furnished house, with few tables, but it never became stuffy. There was a cute bar in the corner by the stairs with a couple of chairs, too.  We started with the squash blossoms and fried tomatoes. Both dishes had goat cheese that was fluffy and almost seemed whipped. The fried tomatoes were excellent. Perfectly fried with a balsamic glaze. The squash blossoms were definitely strange, but a good kind of strange. They were bitter and seemed to be fried in an egg batter.  My main dish was the Pici, which caught me off gaurd at first. The homemade pasta tasted similar to Udon noodles. The sauce had a very distinct and sweet lemon flavor to it. There was a pile of ricotta on top that I had to mix in. I had a bite of the zucchini polenta as well. The zucchini was served on a wooden board and the waitress came over with a steaming pot of polenta and poured it over the zucchini. So odd, very unique. Definitely not a normal italian restaurant. I will come again.    Update: I had an absolutely stellar pizza last night that bumped up Stagioli to five stars. They also apparently change their menu, which I very much can get behind. Wonderful added menu items!"}
{"text":"I've been putting off writing this review because I have way too many good things to type up. But I'll keep it to a minimum and include the highlights.    Let's start with the staff and atmosphere. I love the vibe of the restaurant and the cozy lighting. It is a perfect spot for a date or to have a homemade Italian dish with friends.  The staff...beyond AMAZING. I've been there about four times and they recognize me are always quick to say hi.  It doesn't stop with just hi, they come up and carry conversation and that's when I usually ask them for dish recommendations.  Julie is my go to girl for that, she is always making food suggestions and never fails me.  Brian the bartender is also always super attentive, taking his time crafting the perfect drink.  The other two men who are waiters are nothing short of awesome as well.  The staff is always making dinner an enjoyable experience by being super attentive, making great suggestions, and keeping us laughing.   Now. The DELICIOUS food. I am very very skeptical of Italian food.  I have yet to come across a good Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh, until now.  I come from a huge Italian family so all I've grown up with is homemade Italian food.  Gnocchi is my favorite thing my grandma made, but I never order it from restaurants because they all fall short of my expectations.  The gnocchi is stellar.  It's flavorful with perfect texture..just like my grandmas!  The mozzarella ball as an appetizer...a cheese lovers dream, it is so fresh and delicious. I've had the polenta as well, which was phenomenal.  Last time I tried the stuffed hot peppers which were also so delicious.  The bread served before your meal is also warm, soft, and everything I could ever hope for lol.  Basically I've never had anything I did t like.  Oh! And I forgot to mention dessert. I managed to squeeze it in after almost bursting at the seems from my dinner (don't judge), but I ordered the Nutella hazelnut mousse...sooooo tasty.   The best part...the prices.  This place gives you giant servings (I even order the half portions) for a great price.  So last time I was there, we ordered four entrees, a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and dessert..for $100!!! That is unheard of. You really get your bang for your buck here. Man I can't wait until my next visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Service, food, environment- everything! I don't have a bad thing to say about stagioni. From the drinks and wine, starters, sides and main course and finally dessert..ALL AMAZING!  We ordered the home made mozzarella, deep fried olives and beef carpaccio. all three were great! The mozzarella was still warm, can it get any better than that!??  There were 4 of us at dinner. 4 different entrees, all of which I tried! Ricotta cavatelli, pappardelle, grilled tomato braised meatballs and swordfish involtini. I was in heaven, and very full.   Finally dessert- carrot cake, tiramisu and olive oil chocolate cake. Lorddddd have mercy, all three I would highly recommend! I feel like I've died and gone to heaven after this meal. And like I should hop on a treadmill, but totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"A lovely dinner. First, they offer a corkage fee for the Benneserre Phenomenon that I brought, although the wine list offers a nice selection at reasonable mark ups. Started with the homemade mozzarella,  quite nice with a good amount of parma prosciutto included.  The grilled calamari was well prepared,  a little heavy on the fingerling potatoes.  Followed with an arugula salad, the artichoke companata with chickpeas was delicious.  Next was polenta with poached octupus,  again delicious,  the polenta a little softer than I prefer. Ended with cavatelli with a mushroom and leek ragu, superb. I look forward to our next visit. My compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"We ordered the homemade mozzarella plate as an appetizer and it was soooo good and I'm not even a huge fan of fresh mozzarella.  They sprinkled some salt on top which I think balanced the flavor of the cheese and the balsamic drizzle.    For the entree, I ordered the scallops with roasted cauliflower, pine nuts, golden raisins and parsley.  The scallops were fresh and delish!  I would highly recommend.  Most of the friends I was with ordered the gnocchi and really enjoyed it.  All in all, everyone was really satisfied with their meal and we didn't feel rushed to finish so were able to enjoy a relaxed meal together."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Italian restaurant using fresh ingredients. Brandon the bartender whips up a special cocktail.  Tonight was the bespoke cocktail made with Earl Grey infused grappa. It was excellent.  The cavatelli pasta with mozzerella and spinach had great flavor and consistency, plus it was vegetarian. I'd get that dish again and again.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been slowly working through restaurants in the south side that I have not gone to and Stagioni has been on that list for quite some time. When my pregnant cousin had an overwhelming desire for pasta, I knew we should give stagioni a shot. A couple of us girls went one evening for dinner and the waitstaff was pleasant, the food was good and everything was reasonably priced.  I resisted my pasta desires and ordered salmon that came with asparagus and an egg sauce. I was so happy that I did! While they do have a small portion option for their pasta dishes (which is amazing) the salmon was cooked perfectly, as were the asparagus, and the egg sauce was soo buttery and delicious.   The rest of my party ordered pastas, one a bolognese and the other got a ragu. I did get to try them both and honestly, I preferred my fish. Overall though, it was a really good meal and I'd like to return and try some more dishes!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice.  Unfortunately, that is all.  Our server was a disappointment.  Did not explain dishes correctly, did not ask how any of our plates tasted.  When my wife pointed out something on her plate which didn't taste good, his words were, \"oh, ok\".  After a while we decided to relate or communication with the host.    The food was a big disappointment, which seems to be normal for Pittsburgh.  Appetizer of Mozzarella and Prosciutto was way too large.  The cheese was bland, and the prosciutto sub par in taste.  Nothing creative on the plate, just slices of meat, a big ball of cheese, some vinegar, and a roasted yellow pepper compote (which actually tasted nice).  The other appetizer was Polenta which was smothered in what we believe to be a ragout which used canned mushrooms.  If they were not canned then they were made far too early for this service, or quite possibly the day before.  This plate was a major crash - terrible.  After this we shared a salad of endive and radicchio which had way too much Pecorino, not enough acid in the vinaigrette, and was chopped very sloppy in the kitchen.  The plate was boring and not tasty.  I asked for a lemon to add some vibrancy and acidity to the dish, this was the only way to give it life.  On to the mains:  My wife had duck.  First let me say the duck on the plate was cooked outstanding, but everything else on the plate was terrible and didn't make sense.  I think the duck was cooked sous vide, as it was perfectly moist.  This led me to think, \"how can this chef have so many bland and imperfect dishes, but nail the duck\".  Quite possibly this technique of cooking duck came from another restaurant chef in town?  hmmm, Salt of The Earth?  I ordered what they called a lamb steak.  Very tough and chewy, over salted, and way too large.  It was paired with crispy gnocchi which had no chance of being crispy because they laid the steak on top of the gnocchi.  Also, the gnocchi was flat....in terms of prep this basically means that whoever made it overworked the dough.  We shared a bottle of cheap Italian wine, which had the typical American triple mark up in price.    No dessert, and all this for only $130  enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stagioni has now officially moved from Bloomfield to the South Side. What a great addition to the South Side dining scene. From the sounds of the Bloomfield reviews, things have changed (for the better.) They still have the amazing made-to-order mozzarella. They still have a regularly rotating menu featuring seasonal items. They now have a separate bar area and dining area. You walk directly into the bar area, then you turn into another (quieter) room to reach the dining room.  On a Wednesday night, it was lightly crowded, making for a quiet romantic evening. The waitstaff was very attentive - encouraging my husband and I to split a main course along with the mozarella and 2 small pastas - plenty of food for 2. The gnocchi's were delicious little pillows of dough, that I would return for in a heart-beat. A mushroom pasta was equally home-made, but lacked a little excitement. Our main course was the duck breast which was also perfectly cooked. With well-made cocktails and tip, we had a very diverse, filling meal for well under $100.   So far, Stagioni doesn't appear to have attracted the crowds it had in Bloomfield. Given the quality of food and relatively reasonable prices, I don't expect the quiet to last long.   Here's to hoping they revive their brunch in the South Side location, too!"}
{"text":"I fail to understand why this place does not get more buzz.  The food is outstanding.  I especially love the Fettuccini and Rigatoni which are so rich with flavor.  We just went there for NYE dinner and could not have had a more delicious meal."}
{"text":"The service was SO slow. Additionally our meals (pasta) came out cold. It was so unpleasant that some of my companions sent their meals back."}
{"text":"Dinner date with my sister on a Wednesday night. Almost every table was filled, I recommend reservations!   We started with decaf coffee (thrilling, I know) Our waiter brought out a french press pitcher! He left it on the table for us to refill our cups when needed and it was delicious! I've never seen coffee served at a restaurant like that so I was impressed.   My sister had been to Stagioni's before and insisted on the MTO Mozzarella appetizer. My sister knows good cheese, trust me. It's a good portion of her personal food pyramid. I am not a huuuuge cheese fan but I trusted her opinion and we got the mozz. The dish was served with prosciutto, roasted red peppers and olives. The cheese had course seal salt on top and the whole dish was sprinkled with a balsamic glaze. Well, my sister was stop on. The cheese was incredibly fresh and it had a deep flavor profile, which I find rare with mozzarella cheese. The glaze and additions to the plate complimented the cheese without overpowering the taste. I would get this again...and again...I plan to go back just to order this the next time I'm visiting Pittsburgh!  Since the mozz app is large, we opted to share two small dishes- polenta with shrimp & salsa verde and a side of fingerling potatoes. Both dishes were delicious but the servicing style of the polenta was my favorite part. The shrimp and salsa verde is brought out on a small cutting board. The polenta is brought out separate from a small cooking pot and poured directly onto the cutting board, Unique and fresh! Excellent taste. The shrimp were lightly seasoned and the polenta was moist (I apologize if you hate that word, it's the only way to describe it!) The fingerling potatoes were roasted and served with a sundried tomato paste. Mhm Mhm Mhm! Excellent pair. For dessert, we opted to share the Nutella Mousse. I know what you're thinking, \"Nutella mousse- have my dreams come true??\" My sister and I certainly thought that and we were disappointed to receive pudding inside of a wine glass with whip cream and roasted hazelnuts on top. The hazelnuts had good flavor but the pudding only had a hint of Nutella flavor *cue the tears* We didn't finish the pudding and know better than to order it again. Dessert is my least favorite part of a meal so I didn't let the lackluster mousse knock down their rating.    Service was fast, friendly & professional. Ambiance is quiet and romantic but still a good place to go with friends! I will be back for the app and to try a few other entrees!"}
{"text":"Second visit and probably our last...mozzarella was very rubbery and lacked taste .....dates wrapped in speck were delicious but were tough to cut with a butter knife...brussell sprouts salad was very good...meatballs were great and steaming hot.....papperdella pasta?  a little dry, could have used more sauce and was just lukewarm....and the full portion was way too small (waiter informed us that a full portion was 4 cups, ah not so much)....gnocchi came out lukewarm.  We would have notified the waiter but he didn't visit until we were about finished.  So, a little disappointed.....maybe it was just an \"off night\""}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times, and the food is always good.  Even more impressive is the service - best wait staff I've ever encountered at a restaurant.  The mozzarella appetizer is amazing.  The marinara sauce on their pasta is the best.  I like how small and quaint the restaurant is."}
{"text":"A few friends and I tried this out when it first opened. Fun BYOB, small and intimate. Excellent food. As it just opened some of the food was outstanding, and some was merely quite good. I'm sure at this point, things have smoothed out a bit. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ok, went here for our anniversary dinner. We essentially like Italian food when we go out. Our favs are Davios and Alla Famiglia. This place doesn't compare. It has ok food. Nothing to write home about. We sampled the stuffed peppers beet salad, seafood soup and bolognese pepperdelle. Go some place else. Too many college kids and pompous patrons."}
{"text":"FABULOUS! My family and I had the good fortune of dining at Stagioni on June 5. We were in Pittsburgh for a wedding and my cousins and I were looking for an exceptional dining experience and we found it! Being a party of ten we were able to sample a bit of everything on the menu. Kudos to Kurt who was friendly, attentive and very knowledgeable. He made a our dining experience memorable, comfortable and just a wonderful time. He made us feel like we were in our own home!  The wine list is spot on and I can't say enough about the food. It is fresh and delicious. If you can, please try all the appetizers and pastas. They are truly delectable. Also, try the polenta. It is served like it is suppose to be...on a board! Since it is a farm to table restaurant, the menu changes often. But whatever the food, it will be out of this world!"}
{"text":"One word: REMARKABLE.  We went here for my 30th birthday dinner and we were blown away. We started with their homemade mozzarella. Absolutely divine. The grey salt was a delicious addition to the top of the mozzarella. We enjoyed their grilled salad before dinner and loved it! Every single bite was harmonious and outstanding. We were able to try a lot of their specialties for dinner because we were in a group. I got the Pici, my husband got the gnocchi, my mom got the rotolo, and her husband got the tagliatelle. As a table, we shared greens and beans and the pickled beets. Everything was absolutely outstanding! I highly suggest this place for a delightful dinner with excellent service."}
{"text":"Full disclosure. I adore Stagioni's, but I've never actually eaten in the restaurant. Each time I've been there, I've eaten at the intimate, granite-topped, 4-seater bar as you enter. If you're lucky enough to snag a barstool at said bar, you've hit the jackpot!  The bartenders are skilled, friendly and knowledgeable about the both wares behind them and the menu of fine, very approachable Italian cuisine. Trust their recommendations on both food and drink...they know their stuff.  Our recent visit started with cocktails...a Salty Italian for me, a classic Gibson for my dining companion. Both were perfection. Being New Year's Eve, instead of a big meal, we made dinner of several appetizers and dessert...and another cocktail each! If you try nothing else at Stagioni's, do NOT miss the Brussels Sprouts Slaw! Shaved, crisp and lacy sprouts, salty pecorino, bits of sweet dates, crunchy toasted hazelnuts and a dressing of browned butter and damned good sherry vinegar was the delight of the night! I easily could have ordered a second heaping bowl for dessert!  We also shared tender sweet shrimp atop a bed of crushed, olive oil dressed and seasoned chickpeas and a tart, snappy giardinare of fresh fennel, carrots, onion and radishes. The dishes complemented each other beautifully!   To finish the evening, we shared a pistachio semi freddo crowned with a healthy sprinkling of cocoa nibs, nestled in a pool of orange creme...cold and creamy and crunchy...nice ending! Oh, to accompany desert I sipped a classic Manhattan while my companion enjoyed a Smokey Snap...Art In The Age Snap with lemon syrup, a touch of scotch and an orange twist. Yum!  I'm sure my experience would have been just as wonderful seated in the cozy dining room...it always looks so warm and inviting from my perch at the bar...but why buck what is tradition by now?!"}
{"text":"I dined at Stagioni last night and had a fantastic experience. I won't go into my expectations prior to arriving, but I did make reservations and would recommend doing so if you dine here.   The atmosphere was great (I sat downstairs) and it was small, but intimate and cozy. The kudos continue with the food as well. I had a bottle of wine to start. Then, I proceeded to ask our server a lot of questions. I do this because I am sometimes clueless as to what is on the menu, but I also like to hear how servers describe things and if they get excited/are passionate when describing the menu to me. I enjoyed the menu of Stagioni. Fairly large and diverse, but you can also share pasta meals if you do not want a meat entree. I ordered the risotto balls antipasto, shrimp and salsa verde polenta, mushroom gnocchi, and peppers as a side (I forget their name). I ordered all of this and shared it with my guest. The food was fantastic. Rich in flavor, but simple and delicious.   I then proceeded to have a night out at various bars and restaurants where I told everyone how great my experience at Stagioni was. I'll be going again, and I know I convinced others to try it out as well!"}
{"text":"Update: Since my first dining experience at Stagioni, I've been back once, in late spring 2017, and brought with me numerous colleagues while visiting the area for a conference, and it was just as amazing as the first time I was there. I became very popular with my colleagues for recommending the place, as they all loved it as much as I did.  We all proceeded to tell others at the conference about the place, and throughout the rest of the week, people kept commenting to me in passing about how much they loved it.  I also recommended the place to a friend when she visited the area in April 2018, and she described her experience as \"effing amazing.\"  Kudos to Stagioni for your consistent excellence!  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Went here with some girlfriends when we were in town because we wanted a place near the bars on Carson Street. Personally, I wasn't the BIGGEST FAN, but my friends all kept saying how delicious it was, so maybe it was just me.  The restaurant is adorable and cozy. Drinks are good and the bread was fantastic, I got the shrimp polenta. My friends got the mushroom polenta and said it was amazing. We all got the Tagliatelle pasta which I thought was just okay, but the actual pasta noodles were really really good. Overall, I would come here again for the ambiance, but it didn't blow me out of the water."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant with a cozy bar and main eating area. We ordered fresh mozzarella for an appetizer - it was good but the bread that we were served was burned. Our table ordered the meatballs which were excellent- 3 generous meatballs on a white bean puree. Not something we would've thought of, but  very tasty. We also had the gnocchi which were good- the marinara sauce was flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The third dish was the linguini with green tomatoes, dill, lemon, & parmesan. The pasta was wonderful- a perfectly cooked light noodle. The sauce was very salty and consequently I didn't eat the meal. The staff offered to cook another for me, but by that time we needed to leave. They were apologetic and responsive. We REALLY wanted to love this place but would rate it as \"good not great\""}
{"text":"Excellent pastas. Pink snapper was very good.   The stars were the appetizers, esp. the Beans and Greens (deep savory flavor with bitterness from the greens).  Was surprised we hadn't heard of this place till very recently.  Will be back, both to try the brunch + again for dinner.  Reasonable prices + BYOB makes this affordable for the best Italian food we've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Simply phenomenal. The made-to-order mozzarella is to die for! Very traditional Italian. Wonderful ambiance and service.The Nutella mousse and tiramisu were very tasty and light desserts. Going back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Its not a big restaurant or overly fancy but the food  is exceptional. Simple ingredients & authentic preparation are combined with 1st class service at Stagioni to give  even the most worldly diner a pleasant surprise, to say the least.  But the best part is when the young owner Cara comes over to your table and chats with you about the meal !  My wife and I just love it there. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Though I generally steer clear of the South Side (since I'm not pledging or having a bachelorette party), my family and I headed there on Thursday for our first visit to Stagioni. Though there were a few notable missteps, the lovely atmosphere and a few top-notch dishes ensured I'll be back for more.  The Good: Fried squash blossoms with ricotta mousse (not terribly creative but so tasty it didn't matter), my cocktail (managed to make Aperol and Fernet work in one glass), the quail (nicely charred but still juicy through and through), all of the desserts (the olive oil cake with a lemon-bay leaf ice cream in particular)  The Not So Good: The made-to-order mozzarella (the accompaniments were nice but the cheese was bland and rubbery), the duck (the fat was barely rendered, making for some tough eating), our server (high-strung and clearly trying to leave, he dropped our check when we were just starting dessert)  Though it wasn't the most consistent meal, the high points were high indeed. With an accessible wine list and excellent desserts, this would also be a great after-dinner spot."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Stagioni's.  I must say I am very glad we went back...we had a wonderful experience.  The atmosphere was great and the service was top notch.  The group decided to sample many of the the appetizers and all were wonderful....Made to Order Mozzarella, Goat Cheese Fritters, and Taleggio Fonduta.  Everyone enjoyed their main dishes...all were great.  Would highly recommend this restaurant...we'll definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"I lived in Milan for three years and ate some pretty damn good Italian food.  This place is as good or better than any there.   My wife and I went on a Wednesday night and were surprised with a fantastic $20 bottle wine special.   Our waiter Kurt was outstanding - knowledgeable, attentive, and very pleasant.  Menu was great- not too much but a number of unique (but nothing way out there) choices.  We had a great gnochi dish, followed by roasted cinghiale (wild boar).   All this and a great atmosphere as well.   I'm looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"First rate from start to finish! A small, intimate, restaurant.  I wish we had any of this genre in Houston.  A little noisy, but conversation was not troublesome..  Started with homemade fresh mozzarella and tomatoe - always a good yardstick for appetizer.   The cheese was served warm, the tomatoes sliced thinly, an the whole result was perfect.  Pasta dishes were superb.  We had linguine, gnocchi, and fetucinni, all with tasty but not overpowering sauces.   Main entree's were skate and rabbit.  Fish was extremely fresh.  Rabbit was well prepared.  Desserts - just fabulous.  Tried the Nutella mouse -the Nutella flavor with incredible lightness.  My favorite was the ricotta cheesecake, taking back to my youth in Brooklyn.  Perfectly done.  It's BYOB so the value is excellent.    I can't wait to return on my next visit to Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I had read some great reviews of Stagioni before coming, but unfortunately I was a little disappointed. I didn't think this place was anything special. Went on a Tuesday night with two friends. (I had made a reservation, but you don't need one; there were lots of empty tables at 7:30pm.)   I ordered the pork chop for my entree. It was really average, nothing to rave about. Just tasted like pork. The potato wedges that it came with were a bit over-salted for me. Dessert was much better though. The pistachio semifreddo we shared was great. I love anything to do with pistachios, so this dessert was for me! Would recommend for all pistachio-lovers.   Stagioni has a warm atmosphere, making it a nice place to enjoy a meal, but I felt like my entree was just average. The dessert made the experience better, but I would rather spend my money somewhere else where I can enjoy both my entree and dessert.   Taste | 3 Atmosphere | 3.5 Presentation | 3.5 Service | 3.5 OVERALL | 3.5"}
{"text":"Recently had dinner here celebrating  a friend's birthday with a group of 8 on a Saturday night.  The last time I was in this building it was Le Pommier and the current space still retains the charm that of the now-departed French restaurant.  Overall our dinner was good.  I started off with a nice cocktail, the \"Smokey Snap\" made with Art in the Ages Snap, a spirit so cool you can't even figure out what it is on it's website.  Another diner at the table liked her Salty Italian (vodka, Aperol, grapefruit bitters, blood orange soda) which has also been complimented in other Yelp reviews.  The dinner menu's split into 6 sections (2 different Antipasti sections, Brushcette, salad, pasta, and entrees).  You might be tempted to get one of each.  Unless you have a stomach like one of those hotdog eating champions, don't.  The portions are HUGE.  For example, one of the made to order mozzarella could feed a family of 6.  Likewise, the chicken liver mousse, while although tasty was also monstrous and we would have needed a lot more crostini if we were so inclined to gluttonously attempt to each the entire thing.  For an entree I had the wild boar which is always kind of a fun thing to see on menus.  Served with polenta, braised greens, and horseradish, it was pretty good, but nothing special and also huge.  The wine selection was mainly Italian and reasonably priced.  I was excited to find a delicious powerful Sangratino (about as tannic as you can get) on the menu.  There were a few service missteps.  One of our diners ordered a Jack Daniels with a side of Diet Coke.  They brought him a shot of Jack with a glass of Diet Coke on the side without any ice.  That was a strange occurrence that I hadn't seen before.  Who ever wants a Diet Coke without ice unless they specifically ask for it?  The main problem was that overall our service was extremely slow.  It took forever for the waitress to take our order and for things to come out of the kitchen.  Our dinner of only 2 courses took 3.5 hours, which meant that we were cutting it close with our babysitter.  As this was my only visit to Stagioni, I'm not sure if they're always this slow or not, but it didn't seem very crowded on the night we were there.  Overall, Stagioni serves good (but not great)  Italian food with very slow service.  The portions are unnecessarily gigantic.  This limits how much of the menu you can try (unless you want to waste a lot of food).  I definitely would have liked it more if the service was faster and the portions were smaller, allowing diners to put together a multi-course menu."}
{"text":"Why aren't more people talking about this place?!  Finally made it to Stagioni with a friend, and my meal from start to finish was fantastic.  First thing you notice when walking into Stagioni is the inviting decor. Warm and cozy and perfect for a more intimate setting. The second thing you notice is the welcoming staff -- incredibly nice and knowledgeable about their menu.  Of course, there's the food. The homemade made-to-order mozzarella is exactly how others have described it. It is heaven in your mouth. I didn't realize I would love this mozzarella so much, but out comes a whole wheel of fresh mozzarella cheese with some salt on top and balsamic vinegar on the bottom, delicious proscuitto, olives, and wonderfully roasted red peppers, and you have a delicious starter. Wow.  We also got polenta and went with the octopus polenta. The polenta was creamy and delicious and the octopus paired well with it, a tad chewy, but overall octopus + polenta + complements = delicious.  We also got two half-portions of pasta. For me, these half-portions were really full portions (disclaimer: I do not eat great quantities of food). We got the ricotta gnocchi. Sometimes gnocchi can be doughy and heavy, but when done right, it's softer, pillowy-er, and delightful(er). Stagioni did it right, yum!  We also got the pappardelle with wild boar ragu. The wild boar is somewhat on the salty side, but there is a strong flavor of orange that cuts through it, and the pappardelle was cooked perfectly al dente. Overall, a solid dish.  We were stuffed by the end of this, but of course, peeked at the dessert menu, and my eyes immediately landed on the Nutella mousse.  To top off an already wonderful dinner, the Nutella mousse was perfect. Not only was the mousse perfect, but atop the mousse was whipped cream and deliciously roasted and salted hazelnuts that added a more savory depth to the dessert. SO GOOD.  Again, why aren't more people talking about this place?! Thank you, Stagioni. I definitely need to come back, and maybe even come back for their Sunday dinners."}
{"text":"Four of us split an order of crostini, which was toasted just right and came with a simple but tasty red sauce.  We also had the roasted mushrooms pizza, linguine, and tagliatelle.  All were good, as were the ambiance and service.  Street parking can be challenging, but we were able to park around the block, a short and pleasant walk from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Organized an early dinner here with family that I hadn't seen in nearly 30 years, so let's caveat that my focus was not on the dining experience but rather on catching up with these wonderful people!   The food was good, with no particular stand-outs (but would not recommend the paparadelle), and service was solid - attentive and patient, albeit a bit precious/snarky at times.  I liked the ambiance and feel of the space, cozy and casual.  Wine list was acceptable.  And good limoncello!"}
{"text":"This place has good food but disappointing service. It took us over an hour and a half to get our food and then the waiter gave us the wrong check and ignored us while he served other people. It was extremely frustrating and made the experience not fun.  The food was good but took forever to come."}
{"text":"Very authentic!  This place came recommended as we traveled to Pittsburgh and were a little worried when we first arrived in the South Side as to what we were going to get.  Our expectations were exceeded.  The mozzarella and prosciutto is must.  The dates were top notch.  Ricotta gnocchi and Pappardelle were both delicious.  Half portions were a great option to leave room for desert.  Any one of them would do but I went with the deconstructed cannoli with pistachio.  Very good.  My only complaint would be to pass on the espresso.  Not very strong but outside that, service was great, atmosphere was cozy, and will return to try other items on the menu if ever in town again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after reading so many stellar reviews.  Much to my dismay, it didn't live up to those reviews.  I'm going to hope I just came on an off day.  Did the move from Bloomfield ruin things?  I'll never know since I didn't visit that one...  I will say the one plus was the fresh made to order mozzarella plate with heirloom tomatoes, basil, olive oil and balsamic reduction.  For tomatoes being out of season, they weren't too bad.  And the mozz was awesome!  They definitely perfect that dish.  For the main dish I ordered the gnocchi in a cream sauce with peas and mushrooms.  I love gnocchi if done right.  Wasn't too into the cream sauce or the actual gnocchi.  It just didn't have much flavor.  And the gnocchi fell flat... or should I say heavy.  I'm so in love with the gnocchi from Il Pizzaiolo in Mt. Lebanon that I can't be fair to anyone else's!    I will also make a note that are service was not to hot.  As I've said many of times, I've served so I know the drill.  Put on the pizzaz to earn your tip.  I know we're not a hard table, we even tried to make the dude laugh, to loosen him up.  didn't work.  He just seemed so over it.  It just makes you feel uncomfortable when you have a server like that.  This is the thing though, this place has so many positive reviews that I'm definitely down to try it out again.  Hopefully with a better turnout!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for a tapas-style dinner. The restaurant itself is small and homey. We ordered 4 things plus desert. The worst, in my opinion, was their specialty, the made-to-order mozzarella. The cheese was tough and had little flavor. Basically tasted like milk. The mushroom polenta was tasty. The best, in my opinion, were the pastas. We had the gnocchi and eggplant fettuccini. Delicious.  For desert we had the tiramisu and chocolate cake. Both were solid choices but not memorable. Overall, a nice restaurant with good food. I will return."}
{"text":"Stagioni is definitely a refreshing step up from most other South Side restaurants. We enjoyed a few glasses of wine while sampling a few of the smaller plates and the gnocchi. We ordered one of the bruschetta options and had mixed feelings about it, but everything else was wonderful. I would have been perfectly happy with several orders of the meatballs for my entire meal, but the gnocchi was great as well. And on top of it, we had the best service that I've had in a long time (from both the hostess and waiter). I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Italian cooking."}
{"text":"I had never been to the Bloomfield Stagioni, but when the new one opened on Carson Street, I went with a small group of friends to give it a try.  We went on a Wednesday evening without needing a reservation. However, I highly recommend making one if you plan to dine Thus-Sat.   We ordered the mozzarella plate and mussels to start. While I've seen people rave about the former, I found it rather underwhelming for the price.  First of all, the mozzarella doesn't come with tomatoes, but instead with red peppers and olives (sorry, hate em'). The prosciutto was an interesting touch, but not enough to warrant this dish being the most expensive appetizer when it's just a glorified cheese plate. The mussels were good, but I've had better elsewhere.   On to the main course. I chose the ricotta gnocchi (which at the time was served with sausage in a red sauce with parmesan. These heavy balls of dough don't come close to my beloved Dish \"gnocchi-pillows.\"  What I do like about Stagioni is in all of their pasta entrees, you can choose a dinner or lunch portion. I always find this helpful. Nevertheless, even with the lunch option, most dishes have generous portions.   I've been back a few times to try other dishes and unfortunately I've seen their menu shrink in size. Not a good thing, especially during the summer months when so many things are in season!   The service varies between friendly bartenders and apathetic waiters.   To sum up, Stagioni pales in comparison to many of Pittsburgh's other small Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a fantastic meal here tonight! The octopus was out of this world and melted in your mouth and the pasta was perfect. We loved it and can't wait to go back!"}
