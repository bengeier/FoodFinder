{"text":"Great addition to Outdoor Madison: excellent variety of craft beers, authentic Nuremberg style brats, beautiful view, and a perennial breeze. My new favorite place to meet up with friends, especially friends with kids."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Beautiful views. Great beers on tap, always. And an incredibly friendly staff! I couldn't think of a better place to have a drink after work and relax!"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been here numerous times since they opened. The staff are very friendly and are good with sticking to the rules and regulations. The beer seems expensive, but the same size beer would cost a dollar more on the Square. We come down and sit on a blanket to enjoy the view without purchasing anything, and it isn't overly crowded. The one beer per person rule, and capacity should be updated. Once ownership is done jumping through all the legal circus hoops and additional firey rings that the city has put forth for them, they can focus on that. Perfect addition to my neighborhood - I'm glad this came to fruition."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The prices are on par with festivals in town - $6/beer in a plastic cup & $7/pretzel (+ $2 for mustard). The beer wasn't cold and we sat in the sun to drink it. The sandbox suggests they are trying to be family friendly, but the one drink rule is not family friendly and means partners can't drink together. I understand there is a reason for the rules, but that doesn't mean I have to drink there. I'll go someplace cheaper with shade or A/C without the rules. I hope they are able to improve things. And seriously, it's way too expensive!"}
{"text":"So excited this has opened. We loved the environment and the beer! All of the beer and food is sourced from Wisconsin and the location by the lake is hard to beat."}
{"text":"Great new spot in Madison! Perfect for Summer afternoons. Plenty of local beers, tasty appetizers, and one of the best views in Mad-Town"}
{"text":"After waiting what seemed like forever, I was so psyched to hear that this opened. My husband and I stopped by after work on the way to run some errands. It wasn't the nicest night, storms were rolling in so it wasn't as idyllic as it could be. The pretzel was fine definitely huge, definitely need better mustard though. It was made fresh, but I'd imagine on a busy day they will pre-make them which would be a bummer to pay $7 for a stale pretzel. The bartender does need a lesson in a proper 1/2 L pour also. I'll go back for sure, especially on a nice day."}
{"text":"Shit beer selection. On tap tonight was Sprecher's Root Beer, a blonde ale from Huron, Fantasy Factory, and a hard cider.   To top off the experience, they denied entry of my friend's service dog because he didn't have a vest on. The employee asked if it was a service animal which my friend replied yes and he was still denied entry. The manager, Mike (or Mark, can't remember) just reiterated the previous response.   Here's what the American Disabilities Act states straight from their website:  Q8. Do service animals have to wear a vest or patch or special harness identifying them as service animals?  A. No. The ADA does not require service animals to wear a vest, ID tag, or specific harness.    Q17. Does the ADA require that service animals be certified as service animals?  A. No.  Covered entities may not require documentation, such as proof that the animal has been certified, trained, or licensed as a service animal, as a condition for entry.  https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html  They really dropped the ball on this one, not to mention grossly discriminated against my friend according to the law.  This blunder is right up there with when Grandpa's Pizzeria asked a nursing mother to go to another room.   Train your employees, it will be less of a headache than to become the next persona non grata."}
{"text":"Nice place to enjoy a beer, only negative is that you cannot order for anybody else.  Only 1 beer per person"}
{"text":"I came from out of town with 4 other people. 2 adults over 30, 2 over 25 y/o and a 20 y/o. I see kids inside & i read that this is a \"kid friendly\" place. We asked why there were kids but they can't let in a 20 year old.   My friends and I decided that we want to  check it out & leave the 20 y/o outside but then the bouncer said \"i can't let you in because you are trying to abuse the system\". Excuse me, what? Unbelievable."}
{"text":"As the parent of smaller kids, my dream has been to drink a great beer next to a sandbox where my children could play. Thank you Madison , WI, for making my dream come true! A beautiful setting, plenty of tables, plenty of staff, plenty of parking. The view of the downtown is beautiful, as is there sunset over there trees."}
{"text":"Location, location, location.  Great location to enjoy a beer on the shore of Lake Monona.  Beer selection was OK, we all found something to drink and one has to remember this isn't a bar!  Love their pretzels, the price for their dipping mustard is steep at $2.00 for a small container, but, OK.  The brats were listed as Nuerenberg brats, and no they are not!!!  The tiny size is right, but the flavor was like Johnsonville with more pepper.  ICK.  Why not use Bavaria Sausage for real Nuerenberg brats?  I'd forgive the larger size of theirs to get that flavor.  Then you'd REALLY have something worth ordering than three regular, tiny brats, on a piece of rye bread...which again I've never seen in Germany. Flavor is important, and no one serves Bavaria Sausage brats in Madison, the Nuerenberg ones anyway.  I'd come just for those babies!  Still we'd go there to sit by the lake, enjoy a beer and eat the pretzels.  That alone is worth the price somedays!"}
{"text":"I'm willing to pay a little extra for a beer when it comes with such a lovely view! We enjoyed our first experience here - we regularly go to Olbrich beach and just finally decided to check out the Biergarten. $6 will get you just about any beer, and they had okay options. I had myself an old trustie (fantasy factory all the way) and we ordered a large pretzel that was tasty. You know, it's a pretzel. :) You can't go wrong! What I was pleasantly surprised about was how kid friendly it was. They had a HUGE sandbox and I would say there were more folks there toting around little ones than not. My daughter was thoroughly entertained for the period of time we were there, and that makes any trip out of the house just way more pleasant. This will probably be a top pick when we're craving a beer out somewhere and the kid will be in tow!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place Madison needs but doesn't deserve. Come here asap for a great view and $6 beers with pretzels or brats.  Ambiance/view: 5/5 Beer selection: 4/5 Brats: 3/5 Mustard quality: 4/5 Sauerkraut: 2.5/5"}
{"text":"This is very much a German style biergarden, right on the lake. Limited food choices, various beers, yard games and communal seating. Relaxing and casual."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Olbrich Park for the beer garden. It's awesome place to grab a beer and hangout outside by the lake with friends. It's not too crowded so that's good. I would recommend this place for people from out of town, people who like to enjoy the outdoors with a nice beer, and chillax with friends."}
{"text":"This is such a great addition to the area. The atmosphere is always great and the people working there are friendly. The beer selection is pretty good and hopefully will grow as they get more business. I will continue to support this great addition to Madison."}
{"text":"Such a unique place in a fabulous location!! The beer lists on the days I visited were just ok but they always had One Barrel Commuter, which I love, and they did have an Oktoberfest later in the summer (can't recall who made it...ugh!!) that was great. The staff was always fun and friendly when I was there and did a good job with the pours. I did feel the \"Wisconsin Eats\" were really pricey at $5-$7. The layout is great with the walk-up bar and then everything else a nice distance away. I thought it was cool to have a little patio apart from the larger one and was impressed with the giant Jenga, the Corn Hole pit and a nifty sandbox for the wee ones! I loved seeing such a great variety of folks enjoyng the space: young/seasoned, singles/groups, everyone just enjoying. The lighting and the barrels of climbing hops were the perfect accompaniment to the overall feel. I can't wait for next summer!"}
{"text":"Definitely a beautiful spot along the lake and a nice addition to the area, but there is room for improvement.   First, the tap list didn't particularly impress me. I'm not a beer snob or connoisseur by any means, but the tap list didn't excite me in the least. Second, the pours were terrible. Tons of foam and over an inch short of the rim. The plastic steins were super cute, though. Third, a pretzel is $7 and it costs $2 more for mustard. It's not so much the cost of the pretzel (I believe it's baked locally by Clasen's), but an extra two bucks for mustard feels like price gouging.    The lakeside beauty is hard to beat, and for residents of the area it's probably a great spot. For my money, though, the Terrace is a lot closer and offers better beer, better prices, and better entertainment. I wouldn't be opposed to returning on someone else's suggestion, and maybe in another year or two I'll return on my own in hopes things have leveled out in terms of price and quality."}
{"text":"I love any beer garden that has a beautiful view, kids are welcome and you can bring your own food. I wish their beers changed more, but will be back again, and again,and again."}
{"text":"This place is great! A fun beer garden in Monona, what's not to like? They have a solid beer selection. They also have a few food items to enjoy with the beer. They hold true to the beer garden feel with the long communal picnic tables and the mugs. They also had some bags sets set up outside that people were playing.   There were a good amount of tables and we were able to find a seat. The only issue we had was with their policy that you have to have everybody present in order to buy beer. So every time we wanted a beer, we either had to get up from our table and risk losing our spot, or take turns going. Hopefully they will make some type of update to this policy as it is inconvenient.   I'm happy this place finally opened. It's a great outdoor spot to come enjoy some beer and food and sit by the water!"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to check this place out for a while, and we finally got a chance to last weekend. What is not to love about beer by the lake? They offer a selection of local favorite brews and light noshes. We only indulged in liquid refreshment this trip.  It's a pleasant, friendly atmosphere--every single member of the staff we saw either greeted us, or happily took a beer request. Folks with kids seem to enjoy the fact that there's a great play space for the kids well-within viewing range of the communal tables. This seems like a place that would be great for evening music happenings, and it's a great place to relax (with earplugs, to drown out the screeching children) and have a few beers outside right by the lake.  We are not into \"kid-friendly\" spaces, so we'll be on the look-out for \"adult only\" days/evenings before we'll be back. Also, it'd be nice if they took full advantage of their beer/wine license and actually served wine for those who aren't beer drinkers, like the friends who were with us on our visit."}
{"text":"Not impressed other than it is a pretty setting. Food is high priced, who charges for the honey mustard you dip pretzels in? Brats are tiny like breakfast sausages and served with a useless piece of rye bread. Hard to eat together. Beer was fine the day we were there. There are better biergartens to choose from!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful park for a summer evening in Madison! There are grass fields and volleyball courts on one side and the lake on the other. It is honestly the most perfect place to spend any nice night. The beer selection was excellent and local and the food (and mustard if you're a mustard fan like me) was finger lickin good."}
{"text":"The Biergarten at Olbrich is pretty cool.   Finally stopped by to check it out. Beautiful evening, amazing weather, seemed like the perfect opportunity.   Overall, I wasn't super impressed, but I wasn't disappointed either. It was perfectly OK. The space is nice. There were lots of tables. We didn't have any trouble finding somewhere to sit. The grounds seem well kept. There was a kid play area. All great.   There was a decent amount of beer being offered. Food available, and there was a food cart as well. That was all nice. Bonus - they take cards.   I wish there had been seating options other than the tables. Maybe some adirondack chairs, or just chairs in general, would be a nice addition. I wish there was some music playing to distract from all the conversations going on around you. It just seemed to be missing something, even if I can't quite put my finger on what.   Beautiful setting, though. Right on the lake - super pretty. Pretty buggy, but hey it is Wisconsin!  Will I go back? Probably :)"}
