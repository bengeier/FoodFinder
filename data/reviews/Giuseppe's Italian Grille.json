{"text":"Ok, so  this is my second time here in 3 weeks, and my husband and I are quite judgmental when it comes to Italian food.  We have our local favorites and were excited to try Giuseppe's as we love the venue for its outdoor dining patio.  So charming with the gas heaters and trellis and mood lighting and music.  What more could you ask for?  Well, yes, the amazing food!  We tend to judge our dining experience on the bread and salad to start.  If they are great, we know we are to expect great entrees, and they do not disappoint.  Fresh, hot bread with delicious olive oil and balsamic for dipping.  The salads included with the entree (rare these days) are crispy fresh and include many toppings, even cheese!! Not just some lettuce on a plate with some dressing.  Between the two of us we have now had four different entrees, and ALL delicious.  I cannot wait to try the next time something new. They have a great happy hour wine and appetizer selection, and if you get past that, the entrees are enough to bring home for lunch the next day, LOVE that!  You MUST try, you will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Gonna try to be really positive here. The hosts were really friendly, waiter was nice. Now the nitty gritty. Food was below average in flavor. Shrimp n noodles shouldn't be covered in runny gravy. The old school charm of this place was cool but the atmosphere was almost like they didn't really care about quality service. The chairs they have are old in charm but uncomfortable and flat. I switched the chair I had with an empty table and the next customers who walked in sat there and had to switch it too. Let me guess, we were the first two to have to do the chair swap? Smh. Water wasn't refilled, pizza took 40 minutes to cook, I'd understand the delay if they were busy but they weren't. Our service guy was only helping two other tables so it's not like they were slammed on a Friday. Our food was put in a togo container that leaked out the runny sauce by the time we arrived home. It was for the better unfortunately. A closed lid container would have been nice, not a flappy styrofoam one for the noodles and sauce. Overall my wife and I spent 83 before tip so it wasn't that we ordered cheap items, just expected a lot more for the look of this place. We will not be going back here. Too many other cool spots with better food and service."}
{"text":"Great food, service and drinks. Happy hour is good also! So indulge it's worth it!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Supreme Pizza and it was supposed to have pepperoni on it, but NOPE! No pepperoni. I called back to the restaurant to let them know and their response was \"Maybe next time we'll get it right.\".... What kind of customer service is that? I expect to get what I paid for. Not a \"maybe next time.\" Never again!"}
{"text":"The food here is still very good.  I eat here with my family in the dining room and we are never disappointed.  However the last 2 times I have been in and sat at the bar I was only comped 1 drink because I did not put in more than $20.00.  That's because I kept winning to keep going.  Ended up paying for 2 more drinks. It's that petty stingy attitude why I will never go back."}
{"text":"First time at this place. Unbelievable staff. Very friendly. Great food. Would recommend to other people."}
{"text":"Recently my wife and I had dinner on a Friday night at Giuseppe's. We had been there several times before, but this last visit has left a bad taste in our mouths! Firstly, there was no hostess at the front desk and waited quite awhile before she showed up. Some disgruntled patrons split, didn't like waiting. After we  finally got seated, it took approximately 15 minutes before we were attended to. 3 more parties were seated and we still hadn't received bread or water EVEN after the parties that were seated AFTER us did. We ordered and requested salads, one w/o black olives, an allergy reaction to them, and ordered our entrees. Well, needless to say, entrees arrived before the salads and Both had black olives! We remained steadfast to enjoy our meals and overlook mistakes! I cut into my crusted chicken and it was pink and under-cooked. I ate around it not wanting to complain again and by this time we were ready to leave. Sorry, I don't usually review restaurants., but you need to know it didn't work for us. Won't be back. Word to the wise, a few other restaurants at your location didn't make it. You need to step it up."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I went in for dinner last night (8/19). I had the chicken parmigiana which was so delicious. My boyfriend had the fish picata which he raved about. The portions are huge so we both took half of the food home which was fine by us because we can both enjoy another day of this wonderful food. Our server Christina was fantastic. Her service was right on point. Overall, our experience was great. We will be returning very soon, & for sure will ask for Christina as our server. Well done Giuseppes!!"}
{"text":"We came here with my family. There were 7 of us. We were very happily surprised. From the bread to the salad to the main dish, everything was fantastic. Chrystal was our server and she was great. We had 6 different dishes out of 7 people and we were all raving about how good everything was. Happy to find anther place close to home. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Mozzarella chicken and Caesar salad are delicious. Friendly staff. Prices are reasonable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Spent Mother's Day here... Best service in town!  Price was not bad. 7 guests (3 were children) a bottle of wine, entrees, 3 different desserts to sample around the table. We also had the calamari and dinner salads.   I just can go on and on. But to get to the nuts and bolts... $160 is all this came too!!! We eat like this around Vegas and always hit $200 and have hardly any food!  We even took bags home! Lunch for everyone the next day!  Please don't pass this place up. Give it a try. If you love Italian - old Vegas lov'in - this is your place!"}
{"text":"Very good late night happy hour menu that starts at midnight. calamari, meatball sliders and crusted mac and cheese balls is very good. hands down the best late night bar menu for the price. nothing over $5 and super good."}
{"text":"Came highly recommended by a friend who is a restaurant connoisseur. Here we go; Drinks from the bar, appetizers, entree and dessert were all amazing.  The service was excellent, and the owner even came by our table just to make sure we were satisfied. Great experience!  We will be back..."}
{"text":"We were very hungry for Italian so we decided to try the newly opened  Italian restaurant called Giuseppe's.  We were greeted bu a hostess wearing extremely short  shorts, which were inappropriate for any restaurant serious about food.. Our waitress could not answer the simplest questions about the menu items.  She explained that she only knows what the owners tell her and that it was not her fault she didn't know much.  OK that she didn't know much but she never brought the manager over to answer our questions.  This was surprising/disappointeding.   .  The wine that should have been served at room temperature but was about 40 degrees and when I mentioned it to the manager he just shrugged his shoulders, smiled and walked away.  The food was the worst Italian I've had in years, maybe ever.   The check for my wife and I was $93 and we couldn't even choke it down.  We paid gave a 10% tip and left our food uneaten.   The meal was not worth eating and we'll never go back, suggest you stay clear of this place.   BTW - this is my first negative review   WOK"}
{"text":"We have been there before and had excellent service. On Monday night 11/6 the Waitress was terrible her attitude was rude. She couldn't handle anything very slow service didn't care. Asked if we were ready to order then after I was she gave me the hand and said she wasn't ready yet she had to go to another table well why ask then. Then asked for Ice water it came back with lemon asked if she can get a new one without lemon and I knew she went right through the door with the same water without a lemon probably removed it with her finger there was no way she could of got a new water that fast. I work in the industry and bad service. Dopey and slow. Then the hostess gave us attitude because we wanted a booth. We returned because last time we had a male waiter and he was great."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time during happy hour. Happy hour is from 4-7. Was disappointed that 50% off wine only applied to their house wines. We sat in the restaurant but noticed the bar had a stink from smokers even though no one was currently smoking. While we weren't happy with the bread that was served, the rest of the meal was excellent and the portions were large. The fried calamari appetizer was excellent as were our Caesar salads, chicken parmigiana and lasagna. The tiramisu is the best we've ever had."}
{"text":"We decided to go here tonight to celebrate our son's birthday because we like the food the lasted few times we visited.  Tonight was very different,  and disappointing.  From the moment the food arrived it was visibly different,  with the marinara sauce being a deeper red than marinara usually is.   Upon tasting it,  the sauce was quite bland,  as were the meatballs.  No texture,  no Italian seasoning and not really appetizing.  I had chicken parmesan,  and the chicken looked like it was thawed out frozen chicken patties,  very thing and over crusted.   I wonder of they have changed chefs,  or ownership,  as the menu changed also.    The tiramisu was good for desert,  however.    I was let down,  actually,  and I doubt I will return.  Sad.  I liked the food there before."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant I have been to in a long time. Shout out to Tina Jordan and Kristy they made us feel like a guest in there home and the food was exceptional. This is my new go to restaurant and bar."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in during happy hour and was in the bar. I was greeted by a very friendly bar staff, liz, michael, frank, and brittney!! The happy hour menu was  great!! Drinks are half off also. The food is always delicious, the sliders are juicy!!! Finally, a burger thats not well done. Of course i am now a regular"}
{"text":"Good pizza, piss poor service. Seems like some kinda tip war going on between the bar and table service.   Been there numerous times always the same issue, bar WILL NOT SERVICE table side patrons, they watch you waiting, nada no service, no response, no effort from the bar.  Try to place an order, at the bar, even a drink order, \"I will send a server over\"... server eventually shows, but service remains PISS POOR."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here 3 or 4 times. I haven't dined on the patio but that looks like a fun atmosphere. Inside has a pretty dining room with a nice ambiance. The pizza is always good and my parents enjoy the lasagna."}
{"text":"So surprised at this place. Got the Alfredo brick. Really good. Great bartenders. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The Happy Hour Menu is great. Even though it's not on happy hour the Wedge Salad is awesome! Great flavor and great value. Good food and service. Defiantly recommend them. Lots of specials too."}
{"text":"Guiseppe's is not only a great neighborhood Italian Grille with great food and a bar....They are amazing at Party trays too!  We had our Cousins wedding reception at our home Saturday 05/10/14. DELICIOUS!   Out family is Italian, so it is hard to please them with food not made at home-but everyone raved about how delicious everything was...rigatoni with marinara sauce, penne with chicken alfredo, Yummy Italian sausage with peppers/onions, fantastic large meatballs and perfectly prepared antipasti platters!   Vince Patella was so helpful and followed through on all promises! I will choose them over and over again!  Grazie"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Giuseppes  on Horizon Ridge, twice, and both times we were very upset.  The waitress put us in a booth, which had crumbs all over the seat, and the cushion fabric was torn. WE brought it to her attention, and her reply was for the crumbs was \"Well there must have been kids sitting there before you.\" OK, that is NOT an answer to a customer, when the waitress should check her area before putting a new guest in the same seat.  She moved us to the next booth, and there were crumbs there also!  But the worst was the booth that was torn in the cushion, was still torn 3 weeks later.  Our food was very bland, the pizza had a blah taste.   The sauce tasted like it is bottled and the food was a frozen item.   We will never return there, seems like management is lacking good training. In the future we will take the long drive to Giuseppes on Durango, where their food is always excellent and the staff is knowledgeable and professional.    Sorry!"}
{"text":"My father is a retired executive chef. With that said I'm picky about my Italian food, I was blown away with their linguini in a white clam sauce, it was absolutely amazing. The dish reminded me of my fathers cooking. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, great service. Would definitely return. The Cajun shrimp pasta was awesome!  Crispy, tasty calamari, excellent French fries and burger. Prices very fair. Nice happy hour with discounted apps"}
{"text":"We had reservations for 5, called in 2 days prior. The person taking the reservation stated that we did not need to make a reservation but could if we would like. We opted to make the reservation since it was a client dinner. When we arrived they claimed there was no reservation for us and that there was a graduation party going on and no tables available.  We show them on our phone the date and time we had called in for the reservation. There were no apologies or \"I'm sorry, let's see what we can do for you\" just justifications.. showing us a sign they had at  the register telling personnel not to take reservations, and saying we could eat at the bar or wait and see if something opens up on the patio. We opted to go some place else due to their attitude.  A fairly new place that we were anticipating to try, but doubt will ever go here again due to lack of customer service and empathy."}
{"text":"Love Giuseppe's food but not impressed with the service. Don't know what has changed in the last few weeks except most of the staff!! We are no longer greeted when we walk in, actually that takes a bit of time now and when we are finally greeted we are made to feel that we are interrupting their conversations with other staff, not a very welcoming feeling. Will give it another try, again because their food is great... It is up to Giuseppes staff where we go or don't go from here..."}
{"text":"I haven't had a disappointing experience here yet. We have dined in once and gotten take out twice. The lasagna is great. So are the meatballs."}
{"text":"I am really kicking myself for not trying this place sooner.  Very good food, great service, upscale atmosphere (yet casual) and exceptionally reasonable prices.  The restaurant reminds me of Ventano's in terms of food quality, service and atmosphere albeit without the Strip view and at much lower prices.  In fact, Giuseppe's prices are more in line with Carrabbas; however, the food, service and atmosphere are a far better at Giuseppe's.  I would definitely recommend the meat sauce (versus the marinara) - as close to a homemade \"Italian\" sauce as I've come since living abroad.  Appetizers and desserts are also good but the entree is more than most people can handle.  Not uncommon for the owner to check in table-side.  If I'm looking for a nice Italian meal out without getting over dressed and dropping a lot of cash, this would be my first choice.  Note - this location is slightly off the Horizon Ridge and Eastern intersection -- at 2630 Horizon Ridge about 0.25 miles east of Eastern Ave.   Reservations are possible; however, the wait is never long."}
{"text":"March 19, 2017 6:00 p.m. all I wanted was to eat some Italian food but when I walked in and was not greeted (I actually greeted the hostess first) that tells you a lot about a place....then to top it off was told 25 min wait....5 minutes later called the restaurant and was told 45 minute wait....I want to thank you for having such poor service because less than 5 minutes away I found an Italian restaurant with the best food I've had in a long while.  P.S. : To the management don't bother responding to my opinion because you've lost my business and I will let masses know about the service."}
{"text":"Nina is amazing had a great time great food and the atmosphere is very fun. We felt like an Italian family."}
{"text":"Nice place, generous portions.and very attentive service. Very pleasurable experience at a good value."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  Always a good idea to start at the entrance, right?!   If I could give \"0\" stars I would!  We had dinner here over a year ago and really liked the chicken parm sliders.   We decided to go back last night, Sunday evening, around 7:30 PM but were afraid we wouldn't get in since it was probably crowded.   No, there was hardly anyone there!     As we approached the front door, the whole surrounding area in the front of the restaurant was littered with paper and debris and the pavement was grossly dirty!   The Manager/owner was next to the front door smoking away!    The Casino portion of the restaurant was pretty full.  This was not a good sign.    The Hostess that they had a year ago was no long there and we actually had to walk into the dining room to hear someone say, \"seat yourselves.\"     I could tell right away that something was \"off\" and not in a good way.  We sat down and were promptly recognized by the waitress.   She gave us menus and asked if we wanted something to drink.   We asked if they had Chianti by the Carafe.  She said yes and proceeded to go get the wine.   She then came back with two glasses of Chianti.  We asked why we weren't served the carafe and she said they don't have them anymore.     The menu has been significantly changed and the food is much more expensive.   I ordered the chicken parmigiana and my husband ordered the chicken piccata.  Both dishes were full of salt, the spaghetti sauce was absolutely terrible, and the chicken parm was overly breaded and tasted like frozen chicken patties.     I can now see why there were very few folks in the restaurant.   We certainly will not be returning any time soon!    Not sure what happened to this place, but my guess is the restaurant has changed hands or wants to make additional money at the expense of bad food!"}
{"text":"The best part of the meal was the salad and bread, my wife order a shrimp and pasta, and veal Parmesan for me, the pasta was reheated few time the veal was old and the cheese....well was non existent just terrible not fresh at all, I had higher expectations for this place but never again."}
{"text":"Best pizza!!  Great service by Andy.... nice friendly atmosphere.  Been there several times and we'll be back many more."}
{"text":"You're not even worthy of one star but I'll be generous. Imagine the employees losing their cool and start punching their customers because they don't like being confronted after using profanities. I also know my rights as an American and the third world tactics being used to run this joint is laughable. The short bearded bartender actually put his hands on me and punched me and pushed me, even though I left their restaurant. They followed me outside. Then they called the cops on me after committing a crime, I could still press charges on you. You deserve the dumbest criminals award! If you are in need of a manager please contact me, I can teach you a few basic customer service techniques I learned when I was 16 working in McDonald's. Your pizza's are good though!"}
{"text":"It's kind of sad when I go to an Italian restaurant and the best thing is the sliders that my husband ordered. I either ordered the wrong thing both times I've been here or their food is just not very good. Very disappointing. And the service? Not very good either. He refilled my water once and that was after I had to ask him for more at the end of my meal (that I didn't eat btw). Well, makes for good Italian food that I can remake later."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Las Vegas.  My husband and I have been going here regularly for the past year.  The food never disappoints and the service is outstanding.  Christina our regular waitress is wonderful.  Joseph also provides top notch service.  Great happy hour drinks and appetizers 7 days a week.  Best wedge salad in town. (A meal in itself).  Most portions are large and the prices are right."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend last night and was excited to try this location because we visited their Durango location and it was really good. This location disappointed me food-wise. We both ended up getting the French dip sandwiches, based on her advice. The au jus was quite salty. Sandwich was subpar at best and I did not even eat all the fries. Decor was very nice - a bit upscale - and they do have an outdoor dining area. Service was good.  Not sure if I'll return...."}
{"text":"There were roaches on the patio! Not just a few. I'm talking a whole colony. I know the Vegas desert heat brings tons of critters, but for goodness sake, spray the patio! My boyfriend and I had a hard time stomaching the food just because of that. The owners of this place needs to remedy the problem pronto. It's not very appetizing. The only reason I'm giving one star is because I can't go any lower. Gross!"}
{"text":"The food does not have the good Italian taste that we have become so accustomed to in the area. Our party had 5 adults and all had something different, all we're not satisfied, none will return here. Don't waste your money and time. Nice building and location to bad!"}
{"text":"Ordered the roasted vegetable pizza, and was extremely disappointed, I said no tomatoes add pineapple, the was no sauce on the pizza and barely any cheese the vegetables seemed like they had already been cooked, maybe days ago, I like this place but my husband has never liked it so I'm sure he will never go back I will go inside to order next time."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place but was a bit reluctant to go to a bar for Italian food. So one night my wife and I decided, okay lets try it. Well, what a surprise. You can eat in the bar or a very nicely decorated restaurant. We chose the restaurant to not be in a smoking area.  Our server, don't remember his name but, he is the son of the owner and was very polite and very helpful and informative, telling us that the sauce is made fresh every day and much more. So anyway, had appetizers, eggplant and the mozzarella cheese sticks. Both were very good. Also order the Wedge salad and it was amazing with large chucks of blue cheese and a fair amount of bacon. large enough to share for sure. My wife ordered the Cavatelli Di Casa and I had the lasagna. My wife's dish was delish, the sauce, meatballs and pasta dumplings were crazy good. My lasagna was okay, noting earth shattering. It was obvisously made hours before and only mildly warm on the inside and some very hard but not burnt pasta on the bottom. I also had their house cabernet and it was decent. It is definitely worth another visit but next time I'm going with something they have to cook fresh like my wife's dish. Oh, happy hour is great too. Give it a try, I think you'll be surprised. Ciao"}
{"text":"I was a bit surprised here. I pass by it quite often in my travels and never thought to stop in as it \"seemed\" like the standard sports bar/slot joint that has some food items. Long story short on a whim, and a quick Yelp search, it turns out to be an excellent local Italian place.  We went on a Saturday night, sort of late, without reservations. We had to wait a bit but completely understandable as they were busy. And throughout our entire meal they were busy. I guess I was the only one who didn't know about Guiseppes.  After seating we got our drinks, and app (fried Mac and Cheese) and waited for the Chicken Parm and Lasagna. To me you can judge a good Italian place by the staples; is the red sauce good, do they beat the chicken into submission and over-fry, is the sauce to cheese to chicken ratio good, and is the pasta overcooked. While not in the top-5 of LV for Chicken Parm is was very good. But when you consider the price to value ratio is gains a couple of spots. Guiseppes has very good pricing.  I will be back to try a few of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm super sketched out by eating Italian from a place that has slot machines. However, one lazy night, Bitesquad offered a low delivery charge and I wanted to try something other than the typical Italian spots I frequent. I've now ordered from here at least five times. This place is great! I've had the Eggplant Parm appetizer along with the Mac and Cheese appetizer. The Pasta Pomodoro and the Mediterranean Pasta. All delicious!!!! I highly recommend this spot!!!"}
{"text":"We were here once a long time ago but because it was too far from our home, we didn't go back.  We have since moved and have driven by this restaurant  for ~1.5 years.  We finally decided to stop in for a little gaming and dinner, and we are really glad that we did!!!.   Both the food and the service were amazing and we will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit and we'll be back.  Our server, Christin, was very nice and very attentive.  Their portions are very generous, the linguini in white clam sauce was tasty but a little too salty even for my husband who likes salt, my eggplant parmigiana was delicious but the pasta that came with it was rather bland in taste.  Our fried calamari appetizer was delicious!  Their bread was SO soft and yummy.  The room décor is elegant and their chairs very comfortable.  The paper table topper was a bit irritating as it kept getting caught on my cuff and flipping up."}
{"text":"If you like second hand smoke, you'll love Giuseppe's! Whether you eat in the restaurant or on the patio it's like you are eating in the bar. The team leaves the doors open for their benefit so all can enjoy the smoke.  Like their food and prices so I called in for pickup.... unfortunately, I had to pick up and pay in the bar and choke on smoke. I/we will not return until the owner installs new smoke eaters and bar doors that will close so patrons can eat without second hand smoke."}
{"text":"Had tenderloin sliders,  sucked. I'm sorry there is no other way to say it. Very bad, meat tasted bad."}
{"text":"We are new to this neighborhood and we were referred to this Resturant by a happy employee. We were quickly seated and our servers name was Christi. She was right there ready to take our drink order, just seconds after we were seated.  We started with the Eggplant Parmesan appetizer. It came on a long rectangle plate with three crispy brown eggplant slices covered with red sauce and mozzarella cheese. We both thought it tasted good. We then shared the wedge salad. The salad came with a yummy chunky blue cheese dressing, blue cheese crumbles, and a balsamic glaze. On the side of the plate came, cut up red onions, ripe red tomatoes, and crumbled crispy bacon. With it all cut up and mixed together it tasted very yummy, and well balanced. We agreed it simply hit the spot. We then moved on to our dinner choices. My husband had the small supreme Pizza. It came crispy and well done. I sampled it and thought it tasted good and that the sauce was one of the best pizza sauces I've recently tasted, both not to sweet nor tart. Christi told us the sauce was home made by the Resturant. Also that the Resturant had a carry-out pizza special on Sundays. I chose Linguini with Clam sauce.  My large portion was loaded with lots of pink clams drenched in a flavorful slightly pink cream sauce.   During our meal, our server Christi, took impeccable care of us, our drinks were always refilled before we even needed to ask. She gave great service while dealing with other tables. Christi alone deserved this five star rating. After the dinner leftovers were package to take home. Christi offered dessert. My husband chose the seven layer chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I tasted it and thought, though very rich, it was full of chocolate fudge goodness.  We obviously felt so excited with our dinners that we quickly dragged out our phones to take a few quick photos for Yelp. We appreciate the other photos seen on Yelp for this Resturant, they were what helped us decide on this Resturant for tonight."}
{"text":"Husband is a food snob, has sent back so many meals, but we were pleasantly surprised. Started with Calamari, nicely done, and all rings, no  tentacles, then had sausage and banana pepper appies, with melted cheese on top, need to get the recipe, perfect for sharing. Ordered off the $10 menu. The pork chop Marsala was so tender and tasty, served over homemade papadelle pasta, homemade cheese ravioli, perfect rounds filled with goodness, and chicken pomodoro, bursting with flavor and so moist. The servers could not have been nicer. I plan to hold a large luncheon there after our experience."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot! We came for happy hour which was from 4-7. We had an awesome server named Joe who was super friendly and funny. All of our food was very good. The bread they serve before the meal was also good and served with olive oil and balsamic. Highly suggest the roasted vegetable plate and the salads!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We started coming here every Friday night after we happened upon it by accident. The staff is great. Andy and Vinnie always take good care of us, and Apollo is a great server. We only had bad service one time when we had a larger group, but the food is always delicious and very much like my grandma used to make.   We're moving out of state, and we are going to miss the people and the food here."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza (which normally is really good) at 5pm tonight. Jacob on the phone said it was going to be a half hour. Went to get it at 525p and waited an additional 20 min for the pizza at the restaurant. When they gave it to my husband they said it had just come out of the oven. The pizza was cold. Very disappointing as I really wanted to like this place. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"So disappointed:(  food was horrible, cold and bland! Ordered a glass of wine and the bartender studied the pour making sure it was 4oz. Don't waste your money!!! Go across the street to the pasta shop!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night and it was very good. The salad was fresh and my pasta with seafood was delicious. Enjoyed the wine - Malbec. Our server was very friendly and it was great service. We would go back."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened, but the service tonight was terrible ! We come here quite often, and it's not as if they were busy tonight ! The busboy dropped the bread basket while mid run, our server dropped our plates then did not come back to check on us. My husband took our 3 yr old and I've been sitting here waiting for the check come for almost 10 minutes. Food is always delicious but the service...not impressed :("}
{"text":"Only have been here for happy hour - which they only have on the patio which is far too hot in the summer time. There were no misters or fans running. Only saving grace was the low drink prices. Food was average."}
{"text":"Had the Cran Frita salad and the Trio Mac n cheese. Wow the best salad I ever had and my wife loved her Trio dish first time here and will be coming back"}
{"text":"Took an order to go and found the spaghetti and meatballs to be pretty good.  That was about it.  House salad was sub par and the bread tasted like they picked it up from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Despite all my time living in Henderson and working in 2 different locations nearby AND a lover of Italian food, I had never been to Giuseppe's until last night.  I'm glad I went.  Going out with my girlfriend's family, we were treated to delicious food and solid service.  Our waiter, Joe, was a good guy who made sure we were all taken care of.  The menu is stacked with great dishes, appetizers, desserts, and drinks.  I went with the Trio Macaroni and Cheese, which came with bits of blackened chicken, Italian Sausage, and jalapenos.  It was great, but I don't think you can go wrong with anything they provide there.  For dessert, we shared a pretty decent sized Tiramisu that was probably the best Tiramisu I've ever had.    Next time, I'd like to try the bar area, but Giuseppe's has good prices, good food, and good service.  Not much more you can ask for."}
{"text":"We had a less than memorable experience to Guiseppe's tonight.  We are a party of 10- and what a fiasco!  First of all, we had a new, untrained waiter- Alan.  Service took FOREVER!  Salads came out before the appetizers.  Dinner came out sooooo slow- and we had ordered at least 45 minutes to an hour before. The orders were messed up, food was cold and one person in our group didn't even get his entree until most of us were done eating!  We asked to see a manager- his name was John and he blamed the server- even made the poor kid accept the blame.  I confronted him AGAIN on my way back from the restroom and told him he should never throw an employee under the bus like that- the clown still wouldn't step up to the plate and try and smooth things over- NO!  He threw the kid under the bus again and demanded the pie kid take the blame and then told me \" there's fried dough coming to your table\" like that would appease me!  What an Ass!  If someone in charge besides John sees this- fire the jerk!  As a manager you need to make sure your customers don't leave upset!  You just lost my business, the other people at the table's business and we'll probably tell at least 30 more people!  I'll never go in there again!"}
{"text":"Went there last week , all I could say that this place is worth the visit . I come in , greeted by a nice gentlemen and young lady . My server was on top of it , the shorter gentlemen , joe . I ordered calamari off the happy hour menu . Not exactly half off , but I'm not too worried about it . Restaurant felt very homey , the employees seemed to have a special bond , as the red headed kid smiles whenever he sees the other busser . Our food came out rather quickly which was nice . Our server talks a lot , but he was a good entertainer . Overall , will be coming back again(: ps black n blue burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had"}
{"text":"This review is for the bar only: Bravo Owners! You listened to Yelpers about their experience in the bar, and have made positive changes with the staff. I now feel I can go back to being a regular. Frankie is doing an excellent job of providing world class service in the bar. And Espy is a true gem, but I am sure you already know that.  Food lights: -Eggplant Parm App -Sliders -Cran/Feta Salad -Blueberry Moscow Mules -Above average house wines by the glass  Poker: -I have hit more Royals here in the last 3.5 years than anywhere else in town!"}
{"text":"One of the best local happy hours in town. Stuffed sausage peppers are a gem. Open 24 hours and graveyard shift discount drinks are great prices. Staff is super friendly and the main menu is outstanding"}
{"text":"We have come here quite a few times now. I have learned that they have a $10 dinner menu that is quite good. I've come to enjoy the tilapia special. The tilapia is stuffed with crab. Quite yummy. It comes with a side of pasta. I had spaghetti with a red sauce. Delish. I added in a starter salad for an extra $2. The bleu cheese dressing is to die for. My wife had the chopped chicken cobb salad. Also delicious. The service, as always, was excellent. The ambience could be described as old school Italian. This can be described as an excellent local Italian restaurant with a very reasonable price. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! The Linguini and Clam Pasta & Calamari is to die for!  Service is exceptional, too."}
{"text":"I had a birthday gathering for my husband yesterday. There was 10 of us. We had a private party in a room which accommodated our small group. The food was amazing and our waiter Tony did an exceptional job keeping all of us happy. I would certainly recommend having Lunch/Dinner/Party at Giuseppe's Italian Grille."}
{"text":"Hubby and I brought home carry out from here yesterday and were very disappointed .  $16.99 for an order of ravioli with tomato sauce, which consisted of 5 ravioli with a stingy amount of sauce, and a slice of bread.  Did not include salad ( that's extra charge).  This serving would leave a child hungry.  My husband had the chicken Milano which was accompanied by a side of big noodles with red sauce, which is kinda strange paired with chicken Milano.  He ate most of the chicken but the big noodles were an unappealing choice with it.  We spent $33.10 for a pasta dish that should be on the kids menu, one entree that was barely edible and two slightly stale pieces of bread and one pat of butter. For $33.10 at Olive Garden we could get two full size entrees PLUS unlimited salad and breadsticks.  We have lived here 13 years and still can't find a decent Italian restaurant!  This place certainly isn't."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Italian food in the area. There soups are all very good and the wedge salad is amazing. Save room for some excellent desert."}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly good dinner. There's a bar area (with smoking and gaming) and a restaurant area. Both areas can get crowded. The service wasn't exactly the best at the bar, but it was decent enough. The food was quite tasty. So if you're craving pasta, this is actually a good place to go."}
{"text":"Hit or miss for sure.  Food is good to good+ even but the service is all over the place.  Tonight for example, the bartender (the infamous bald guy with beard) could not tear himself away from his pals long enough to tend bar.   Other times the staff is super attentive and friendly.   Handy to my house and clean upscale environment so I will probably try again but tonight I got fed up and left without ordering dinner."}
{"text":"I am very surprised by all the negative reviews of this restaurant. I have dined here several times with zero complaints. The pasta dishes are very tasty and the calzone was wonderful. We have had great service all three times, even while they were busy. Maybe they are still working out the kinks of a very new place and have some bad moments but none received on my end."}
{"text":"OMG, love this place! We were lucky to get Joey tonight and what a pleasure it was.... It's nice to have that kind of service from the staff it has to be the way the manager sets the standards.. If your looking for great Italian food this is your place.. Service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Friday Fish Fry- so happy we went.  It was really good.  The fries were homemade and we are guessing that the tarter sauce was too.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken parmegiana and it was not good at all. The sauce tasted like it came out of a can. Service was not good we ordered salad and never got it, was not offered Parmesan cheese or olive oil and venigarette like the usual Italian restaurants and the bread was cold. Definitely won't be coming back here again. I felt really awful for bringing my friends here for the first time."}
{"text":"Dined here for mothers day. Atmosphere is very nice. Service was good but very slow. Took over an hour to receive my Lasagna. I must admit, it was the best I have ever had. I would return and sit on the Patio."}
{"text":"Ordered the New York Style Margarita Pizza and Garlic Bread to be delivered to my job because I was starving and cannot leave. This was the first place I saw that had pizza and decent reviews. The pizza crust tasted like crackers and there was NO sauce on my pizza...no flavoring what so ever...probably the worst pizza I have ever eaten...like it's not pizza it's crackers with cheese. Hey at least I have garlic bread...can't mess that up!!!!!! So sad!!!"}
{"text":"No lie, my favorite place to go in Vegas.  The food is a solid 4/5, always really good.  But for the price it's an easy 5/5.  Calamari is great, always the the chicken parm.  Always ask for Pam to be our server.  LOVE happy hour with $3.50 glasses of wine.  We go here every few weeks or so.  When ever family comes in, we always go here."}
{"text":"Love the 5 topping pizza on Sunday but it's impossible to find a parking spot. Eggplant was not very good."}
{"text":"One of my newest favorite spots to eat italian food. Everything is delicious. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very close in proximity to my hotel was this lovely Gem , also a favorite of a local resident who took me there for dinner. I really enjoyed the dinner. The happy hour pricing was fantastic and the portions very generous, the only negative would have been the bar service we received our appetizer prior to receiving our cocktails. Overall a fantastic value and great hospitality"}
{"text":"Huge servings. This is what was left after the crusty bread and Margarita Flatbread... EVOO and Balsamic on the table..yumm. This one serving would feed Mike and I for 2 full meals. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite late night haunts in town. 12-6am happy hour, half off apps & pizzas. Nowhere else can I get a descent pizza at 3am in the morning. The pepperoni is solid & the buffalo chicken pizza is the best I've had in town. The graveyard bartenders are also the best, great service every time I come in."}
{"text":"Amazing staff!!!! Everyone greeted us and talked to us! They are all so nice and helpful!!! Hard to find in this town anymore so this is truly a hidden gem!!!!!  awesome happy hour with some of the best food I have had in a very long time!!!!! I will always come back here and tell people to visit!!!! Beautiful patio! Can't wait until summer when we can come sit outside!!!!! If I could rate even higher I would!!!!! Thank you all sooo very much!!! You made my day!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering from Giuseppe's and everything was amazing! We ordered quite a variety of meals, from lasagna, to tilapia, the California chicken sandwich and the French onion soup. Not only was the hostess that took our to go order kind and knowledgeable, but our delivery driver was fantastic as well!! The food was so great and we will defiantly be ordering from there from now on!! Highly recommend this wonderful establishment!! Thank you! 5 stars to Giuseppe's!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour special (even on a Sunday). Runs from 4p to 7p so would work well on a weeknight. Good selection of half price drinks and most appetizers are but one get one free. I tried the meatball sliders (next time I'll ask for extra sauce on the side because I like them saucy), mozzarella sticks and garlic bread. The table also ordered a shrimp something or other that was enjoyed very much. Server had good personality."}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE. Need to hire more wait staff. Sat for over 5 mins before someone came to our table. My dinner salad came AFTER our sliders so I had it boxed to go - I didn't want it as dessert.  Our order sat on the counter for 7 mins before it was brought to our table. No bread, waitress never came to check on us, husband needed a drink refill and we sat for almost 10 minutes waiting for our check."}
{"text":"Oh boy. As soon as I walked in here I knew it was going to be awful. The minute I sat down I was asked to move because the bartender was reserving a machine for a customer. That's fine but there's no need to be rude about it. I'll move. The lack of respect from the bar staff is uncalled for. Excuse me mister bartender, bald guy with the beard, make sure you keep watching the game and ignore paying customers. Oh and maybe you should learn what the happy hour menu consists of. And while we're on the subject of menus, if there are two people, do you think maybe we'd both like a menu or should we share? Dear lady bartender with the long black hair, thank you ever so much for not even acknowledging my presence except when asking me to move. I fully appreciated your service, it was wonderful. No. The food was good though; the meatball sliders were delicious! Unfortunately, I'll never get to grace my lips with them as I shall never return to this horrendous excuse of a bar. If I wanted to be disrespected for two hours, I could have just called Sprint customer service from the comfort of my home."}
{"text":"We went in for breakfast and ended up ordering lunch.  My husband got the Italian Sausage sandwich and I got the French Dip.  My husband had a look of pure joy when he took his first bite.  Both sandwiches were outstanding.  The fries were seasoned and very good.  We are already planning to come back and try dinner."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Large portions and reasonably priced. However, this was not a pleasant experience.  They were on a wait when we arrived. We were told 20-25 min., but waited 42 min. We would have been ok with the wait if we  had been told that.  To make matters much worse, a table called to make a reservation while we were there waiting and then they walked in and were seated before us. I could have called from the lobby and been seated sooner.  Once seated it took 7 min to be greeted and put in a drink order, until another server took over.  The manager never once came over for a table touch.  The only saving grace was Rick, the server that took over. He was friendly and attentive. He's the only reason they got 2 stars instead of 0."}
{"text":"Tonight my girlfriend and I went to watch Chef (for any of those that have seen it, you'll understand the instant hunger and craving for certain foods). We left the movie  in the mood for pasta and decided to try Giuseppe's as it is on the way home and open late.   I wouldn't be able to tell you about the food or even the menu. We sat at the bar being it was late. We sat there for nearly 10 minutes without any kind of greeting from the bartender. He saw us walk in. He walked passed us twice. He took a drink order from somebody else and served them. All the while he completely disregarded our presence.   We ended up leaving. I was so turned off that I highly doubt we will ever return at that hour or any other hour."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and Brittany (the bartender) took good care of us. The food was enjoyable, but the Tiramisu was fabulous. We will be back.  Try there weekend specials for dinner"}
{"text":"This is a great local restaurant the food is good and portions sizes are enough for two.  The only problem is the service.  Apparently when there are two or three tables and you are seated by the hostess, you wait 15-20 minutes for the bus boy to bring you water... and then wait an additional 10 minutes or longer for a waiter, while there may be two or three of them running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  At that point we just walked out.  This one is crossed off my lost of local establishments to  fraternize"}
{"text":"Regular happy hour and also reverse happy hour from midnight to 8am. So convenient. The food is so delicious. My favorites: eggplant parmesan and cappellini pomodoro. And yes, the kitchen and the whole menu is open 24/7. I'm a late-owl and sometimes I'm just craving angel hair pasta with garlic and tomatoes at 3am. The bartenders are friendly. They're not too pushy and they always remember my friend and me who are regular customers. It's our go-to place for late night eating because of their quality Italian food."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic.  Better than i expected.  Delivery was way late, but food was still hot so that made up for being late."}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars to any business but I love this place. Most of the food is amazing and Resturant looks like a fancy steakhouse on the inside. The Cran Feta Chicken salad is my favorite and the Chicken Fingers are the best. Both of these items are the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"Wow I am blown away by the 1 and 2 star reviews. I'm wondering if the bad reviews are for the location in Anthem which closed recently. I am reviewing the location at Horizon Ridge Parkway at Eastern.   Four of us went to lunch there today and being foodies who eat out at fine dining restaurants often, we know bad food and bad service when we see it.  We didn't see it here, that's for sure.  This was our second trip here in 2 weeks, the first time for pizza only  and I have to admit their thin crust pizza leaves something to be desired but I don't like ANY thin crust pizza so let's move on.  The Pork Chop Marsala ordered by diner 1 was huge, loaded with mushrooms and served over pappardelle.  She loved it and couldn't finish it so took leftovers home.   Diner 2 had the Cranberry/Feta  entrée salad, another huge portion. She also said it was one of the best salads she'd ever had.  Diner 3 had Tilapia in lemon wine sauce and she ate every bite. This diner NEVER eats every bite  of anything.  LOL  I had a specially made broiled tilapia with lemon butter that was perfectly done, moist, tender and delicious.  The dish came with a side of pasta with pomodoro sauce that I thought was outstanding and more than I should have eaten, but I did.  LOL.  The side salad and the entrée salad both were so fresh and crisp they crackled, and with more interesting ingredients than most salads have.  The outstanding white balsamic vinegraitte  was one of the best dressings we ever had, It's made in-house and I would kill for the recipe. We decided the food and service were so good that we definitely would return.  Not one of us had a complaint of any kind.    Great ambience, white tablecloths,. candles on each table, an interesting waterfall separating the kitchen from  the dining room, an elegant/casual  look and soft lighting throughout.  The wine is very reasonably priced. The restaurant has a large and a small banquet room and a beautiful patio with candles on the tables cooling misters, and lighting overhead that I'm sure will be dimmed at night.  We will definitely take advantage of the 4 pm to 7 pm happy hour..    I can only tell you to try this place for yourselves and see what you think.  As for us, we LOVED it."}
{"text":"We visited on at Thursday night around 8:30.  Regarding the food, the soup was pretty good.  The meals were AWFUL. YUCK.  I ordered chicken piccata after being told the eggplant dishes I wanted were unavailable.  It had a bad aftertaste to it.  The pasta that came with it seemed somehow undercooked or stale.  It was just bad.   The waiter was friendly, but inattentive.  He offered parmesan cheese on my food, then left to go get it and never came back.  He never once asked how the food was.  It was as though he knew he was serving us substandard garbage.  We paid $40 and could have had a far better tasting meal from a Lean Cuisine box.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This has now become mine and my better halfs new watering hole! Food is amazing drinks are always great. Staff friendly and atteive... Easly put amazing"}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ADDED WITH RACISM AND UNPROFESSIONAL VULGAR LANGUAGE. I WILL TELL EVERYONE IN VEGAS THROUGH FRIENDS AND WORK ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES. Twice on my visits they took over 45 minutes to get the pizzas out and when I gave feedback I received annoyed unprofessional answers from the manager saying it is what it is. On the night of my brother's birthday we went over there. If I could give zero stars I would. we had ordered over 200 dollars worth of food and were playing and talking at the bar top. The bigger bearded manager and some tall guy with a goatee came over and asked us if we can move to a regular table since we weren't playing much. I informed them that we were indeed playing and with a degrading tone the manager said yea 10 bucks each? I asked him what was with the attitude and that I had been going there for 2 years. they started to yell and cuss at us. they ruined our night."}
{"text":"Update: I went in Friday night and found out that the best server, Kristy, is no longer working! That's the last time I'll be in. Besides, this place is totally going downhill. All the other servers are rude, slow, inefficient and don't know the menu well. One of the male servers, Apollo, is very full of himself. He ought to walk around with a mirror. Save your money for the bar instead."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! The food is so good I have not had anything that doesn't taste amazing. Our waiters have always been very nice and the atmosphere is so nice for a formal date but also nice if we just want a casual dinner. I wish I could give it five stars but we were there on Saturday night had a reservation at 7pm and got there right before seven and were seated right away. We got our drink order taken, drinks were brought and we ordered an appetizer and our dinner. Our appetizer was brought to us and then we sat there until 8:09 before our food came. The waiter blamed it on a large party that they had and while I can respect that, an hour is an extremely long time to wait. I hope the next time we go everything will be good because I just love it so much."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the dinner. Great service and staff. Had sausage and peppers with penne. My wife had the lasagna. Really large portions. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Fettuccine Alfredo Brick was unlike anything I have ever tasted! The Italian version of fried mac and cheese... Incredible! Staff is friendly and efficient. They have amazing home-made salad dressings (my favorite was the tomato basil) We also tried the eggplant parm and rigatoni Giuseppe,  both amazing!!! My new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Was not long ago, this was one of the 'go-to' places for one of the best burgers in the area. But then something major changed.. management/ ownership, whatever. Now, it's a greasy-spoon, less-than-worthwhile offering. When it's this obvious, you might go back again for another try, but you really know it's probably not going to be any better. The only constant is change.. and it's not always for the better."}
{"text":"Besides the server being on top of it& accommodating our table this experience was awful! Our calamari was not fresh. It was over cooked and mediocre at best. Chicken parm was over cooked on edges to the point of burnt. The sauce on the dishes tasted like it came right out of a jar. My chicken parm sandwich was just okay. There was nothing to it at all & no marinara on the sandwich. Just chicken and bread. The blue cheese dressing on the salad was delicious and homemade!"}
{"text":"I hesitated between 2 and 3 stars for our experience at Giuseppe's tonight. I went with 2 because it's like...they're really trying, but it's just not quite working.   My boyfriend and I sat in the restaurant area, there's a bar side as well. The whiteboard in the lobby said \"seat yourself\" so we ventured in to what I describe as a fancy Italian cafeteria. Kind of awkward table layout but the decorations and room itself are nice.   Service was the same way...everyone was pleasant, but the waitress came over and asked if we were ready to order and we hadn't ever been given menus. She brought the menus over, and I asked for a drink menu as well. \"We don't have a drink menu, it's a full bar.\" \"Not even a wine list?\" \"Oh, yeah we have a wine list. Hang on.\"   And that's how the whole experience was. Kind of uncomfortable. The food was pretty good, and reasonably priced. I had Chicken Piccata which I enjoyed, and my boyfriend had Pappardelle with sausage. The tomato sauce on his pasta had a very unique flavor, not a traditional red sauce but not bad. They were out of the only dessert I was interested in (Tiramisu) so that was disappointing.   I probably won't return. I was disappointed that they were so close to having a good thing going on but the whole experience was disjointed. Hopefully they can work out the kinks!"}
{"text":"The service  here was really atrocious. You have to be really bad for me to give a bad review. On a Sunday afternoon no one was at the reception desk to seat us  just a sign telling you to seat yourself. Okay not that  unusual  so we entered the restaurant and seated ourselves. But when we sat down we knew we were making a big mistake because there were NO servers on the floor and the restaurant was about 1/2 fulll and everyone was waiting for food or to order. Sooo we waited and waited and waited and we were just about to leave and this nice young waiter appeared and gave us menus and said our waitress will be with us shortly. So again we waited and waited and waited and  again we were about to leave and our waitress came over to take our order. No hello, no smile, no giving us her name, she just said \"what do you want to order\".  I don't know if she was overwhelmed, didn't want to be there, just didn't care or what but she was not pleasant or happy at all and did not know the menu either nor did she care to find out. When you say \"I don't know\" to a customer inquiring about the menu and you don't  go find out than my assumption is you just  don't care.  I ordered chicken marsala and seeing the table next to us I knew I would not like the marinara sauce so I asked for pasta with olive oil and what I got was crusty spaghetti with EGGS (yes scrambled eggs YUCK!!!!!!my stomach still hurts).  My husband ordered chicken parmigian and he did not like the marinara sauce at all.  We waited unacceptable times for our menu, drinks, soup, entree and drink refills for food that was not good and wrong. And of course we had to flag someone down to get our check too. Of course we were barely checked on let alone impossible to flag anyone down because they were never on the floor. Finally saw someone that came from the back  that started to seat people because a lot of people stood waiting to be seated but left after standing around for a long time with no acknowledgement (lucky them!). But this girl should have helped because you did not need to be a rocket scientist to see the displeasure on peoples faces. Long story short: very very poorly run restaurant, management non existent and not so good food. Too many other good  choices in our area.  We were so mad we didn't listen to our instinct and leave. Live and learn!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night with my husband, I had Mahi (our server's recommendation) and I really enjoyed it. My husband had a pizza, it looked good but I think it was really greasy - he enjoyed in though. Atmosphere is what you would expect of an older Italian restaurant with a character, I think updating it would actually take away from it's personality. Not overly impressed but definitely satisfied. Would recommend for a date night or a nice meal with family."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by some of the work family. MK said they serve up some of the best burgers and I'm all about the burger. Based on name alone, however, I was craving pizza. Upon entry, something on the specials board caught my eye. It was an all you can eat fish fry. I had already committed to the burger, though, and on DL's recommendation, went with the Joey's Burger.   The burger, which by the way is a double, was outstanding. I chose fries as my side, but there are plenty of other options.  The fries were not outstanding, but held their own and complimented the burger nicely.  The iced tea is fresh brewed and was never empty. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was inviting, including some sort of waterfall apparatus between the dining room and kitchen. We were there for lunch, but it looks like a cool place for a date night dinner. I will definitely return with the Mrs. and check out the fish fry or pizza or salt and vinegar wings or ....  I guess I'm going back more than once:-)."}
{"text":"Had a party of 14 for Thanksgiving. It was a great time thanks to our server Pam. She took our drinks as we sat down because we didn't all arrive together. Some people asked for substitutes and she had no problem with that. All and all the dinner was great but the service was exquisite. Thanks Pam for making my family Thanksgiving an unforgettable one."}
{"text":"Great local gem!  BEST happy hour around... $4.50 premium appetizers for Happy hour (Sliders, Calamari, Tacos) With $2 off draft beers, bud light/coors light drafts are $1.50 at this time.  Great deals, great food specials, will be in here often."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere only one complaint that keeps me from giving them 4 stars.....BRING BACK THE ALFREDO BRICK !!!....that is all"}
{"text":"We had dinner last night and we liked it! The ambiance was nice and the service was prompt. The food was really tasty!! We had the cajun shrimp pasta & the eggplant lasagna & we shared the calamari for an appetizer. We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Just a fantastic Italian joint in the heart of Henderson. Vince and his crew are the ultimate hosts, making everyone feel welcome with their amazing menu of Italian classics, pizza and bar food.   We held a private event on their patio and their staff went over and beyond to take care of us. The buffet was great - breaded pork chops, chicken Marsala, penne pasta, potatoes, beans, salad and dessert. The patio is perfect for this kind of event.   Definitely will be back regularly to dine or hang out at the awesok"}
{"text":"This resturant is owned and managed by a Cleveland family.  They are all very nice and generous people.  The resturant is set up with a dinning area, patio and bar.... with tv's that display sports for the most part.  Would not consider a \"Sports Bar\". It's a bar with gaming and tv's with sports.  They have live music on the weekend, that the blue hairs really enjoy .... lol. Actually we can all enjoy live music.  The food every aspect of the food from Happy Hour Specials, to the Weekend Specials, and regular menu is all very good!  There are specialities like Mama D's Lasagna or the Joey D burger, amazing Chicken Parm, Salads... etc We are regulars in the bar, we enjoy all the staff, like Frankie, Jordan, Vessie, Andy, Rick, Espie ... these amazing people along with the food is the reason we love this place!"}
{"text":"The chicken seemed frozen, and the steak was injected with water. Nothing seemed fresh. I am no chef, but I make a better steak at home. The spaghetti sauce was no better than Ragu. Ultimately the meals were bland."}
{"text":"After nearly a 2 1/2 year hiatus I thought I'd give this place another shot since I live less than an 1/8 of a mile away. My hope was that the aweful service and jerky staff had to have been changed or improved by now. It took me about 60 seconds to realize that nothing had changed.   After walking in the bartender sauntered over and greeted me with \"what are you drinking?\" I said I like to see a menu please so she got me one then said \"what are you drinking?\" I asked what her name was and she said \"Jess or Jessa. So are you drinking?\" I told her I might have a drink and stated I had been avoiding this place for nearly 2 1/2 years because of my previous experence. Her smug response was, \"But here you are now, huh.\" I said you're right, then got up and went to the bar around the corner to eat and gamble.   With 5 or 6 bars with in a two mile radius its pretty unbelievable how rude and nonchalanly this place chooses to treat people. There were 4 customers in the entire place so clearly they can use all the business they could get. Epic fail. Maybe I'll try again in another 2 1/2 years from now. Until then I'll continue to tell everyone how terrible the service is."}
{"text":"5+stars. Absolutely delicious fresh baked and cooked to order. The bread was unbelievable. Ordered the jalapeño stuffed with sausage and topped with mozzarella. Large appetizer. Suggest sharing with others.  My husband had angel hair with shrimp Fra Diavolo and there wasn't a drop left. I had veal piccata and it was cooked perfectly with side of pappardelle pasta with garlic, Parmesan cheese and olive oil. It was exquisite. They gave us complimentary cannoli & espresso. Wonderful ambiance. Extraordinary service. Congratulations , we will be back....  And oh so close to our home in Seven Hills"}
{"text":"I really love this place.  BK- before kids, we used to dine quite a bit at top Italians on the strip.  This now is a nice alternative to bring the kids and still feel like we are going to a nice dinner and not fast, casual.  It's reasonable pricing but we always choose the most expensive on the menu.  And we ALWAYS get the same thing.  I will say I DREAM about their white balsamic dressing.  all dressings made in house and delicious.  My only disappointment is I've had the ribeye steak 3 times and each time it was just passable.  But all in all, a great family, neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Super hot blonde bartender who works Sunday nights! Food is great, got the pizza and gnocchi both were A+ and I have been to Italy  and have tasted the best,awesome place to watch games I will be back..."}
{"text":"We been there about 5x. We enjoy the pizza. Happy Hour in the bar area is good we ordered calamari, stuffed hot peppers n sliders which were all good. N the beer is always cold. Dinner we ordered  cavitelles    and the gnocchi which were tasty but order less sauce cause they were drowning in it. We also order a special rigatoni dish which was very good. I recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here.  Was not happy with assigned waitress and was able to speak with Manager, Andy about her lack of friendliness and a little abrupt.  We were given another wonderful and great waitress that gave us the service customers deserve.    Thank you Andy for making our visit right.  I appreciated the extra mile you showed to me and my guest.    We will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! When I'm in the mood for Italian food this is where I go. Try the white balsamic salad dressing on your salad for a great way to start your lunch or dinner off. Some of my personal favorites are: mama d's gnocchi in a vodka cream blush sauce (can never get too much) and their lasagna . We've even used you them for catering a birthday party. Everything was perfect, the food, the atmosphere and the company."}
{"text":"Was there recently and was disappointed with service and quality and taste of meal. The chicken in our chicken piccata was overlooked.  Not nearly as good as before.   Did they change chefs ?  Since then have had couple of carry out orders!  They were very good with big portions.  Ready to go back."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant last night for the first time. We waited at the entrance for about 5 minutes when a tall young man wearing makeup finally came out to set us. And SET we did, it took another 15 minutes to get bread and water. The SET we did again, our waiter apologized and when he walked up in broken english asked if we were ready? Ready oh yes by this time we had been there over 40 minutes.  We ordered pasta dishes and both were very acidic, the salads were not tossed, you get a small plate of lettuce and you are supposed to somehow toss the salad yourself on this small plate.  The pasta itself was cooked right. After they placed each thing on the table a woman who barely speaks english walks up and asks you if it is \"good\". The building itself is beautiful and even though they have gaming it is not smokey.  I just think they need better pasta sauces and better management. Obviously more or better servers as it was not busy but we kept waiting. In all we were there over 2 hours and we did not linger. We won't be giving it another try."}
{"text":"First off they have both Blue Moon and Fat Tire on tap which I love.  I had the pork tacos and mozzarella sticks at half price for happy hour. The tacos were pretty good but the mozzarella sticks were amazing. Definitely not the crappy frozen ones you get at like Applebee's.  My boyfriend had some sort of pasta that was really good. It was an egg noodle with sausage and bacon in red sauce. It is a busy place and the server was working hard and you could tell.  Plan on coming back again."}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to eating here but was sadly disappointed. To start, the bread was old and NOT Italian. The marinara has a rague taste to it and the the lasagne was just ok. The house Merlot was actually good but the frozen calamari was under cooked. The waiter was more interested in setting up banquet tables then waiting on the 2 tables he had. We might go back to the bar but not the dinning room."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this but the food is not even edible. I had eggplant parm. That was the worst eggplant Parm. I've ever eaten. Definitely frozen and reheated. Horrible. We also ordered pizza, had one slice, didn't even bother to take it home. Wow, how can a place this bad stay in business."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Giuseppe's was a Friday evening. We were headed to another restaurant in the area but decided to try this place instead. I'm glad we did. I liked the ambiance of the place, and the food was very good. I had a chicken pasta dish from the $10 specials menu. It was tasty, but not extraordinary. What was amazing was the wedge salad. It's hard to find a great wedge in town, and this place has it!   The other outstanding attribute about this place was our server Pam! What a warm, friendly lady! She really did enhance our dining experience that evening. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing food, it's family-owned and the staff is amazing! If you want to get the best Italian food that you can in Henderson, it's right here at Giuseppe's!"}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch to give it a try - there was one other table in the dining room and the bar had several people in it.  We opted for the dining room, had a great waitress who walked us through the menu since it was our first time at the restaurant.  The waitress was excellent.  The room filled up and she was busting it to keep it all moving and did a great job.  We ordered sandwiches and both were fantastic.  The only downside was it seemed like there was some kind of issue with the kitchen and it took longer than you would think for a couple of sandwiches at lunch time.  They were absolutely worth waiting for once we got them.  I had the beef on weck and it was delicious!  We'll be back - look forward to giving dinner a try in the near future."}
{"text":"We are avid happy hour folks and we absolutely love this restaurant for its happy hour.  The quality of food and the price are spot on. We have always had wonderful, friendly service and great food....that is, until we sat in the patio and got Christina as our server.  The first time we got her, she was so rude, we decided that she must be having a bad day.  However, tonight we got her as our server again and she was totally rude!  We will give her credit for being a constantly rude person.  Because of her, it was a very uncomfortable dining experience.  Next time we will make sure we are not seated in her section. That aside, the food and all the other servers are great!  I would give this 5 stars; however, because of the service we received I will only give 1 star.  There is no excuse for treating your customers bad."}
{"text":"I waited a day to write this review because I didn't want to do it based on emotions at the time.  I've been ordering food for delivery for over 35 years and just had the worst experience ever.  The service was inexcusable and the food was awful.  I was in the mood for lasagna, my favorite dish, went to Grub Hub, and decided to try a new restaurant and decided on Giuseppe's.    We got lasagna, chicken fingers and a turkey sandwich.  They arrived a few minutes early so I was pleasantly surprised at that.  Everything went down-hill after that.  The girl delivering did not smile (most do).  She did not say hi (most do).  She did not say thanks (virtually all do).  She actually threw the food to me, turned around and walked away without saying anything.    The funny/sad thing I actually tipped big ahead of time.  Maybe she figured, \"I already got my tip so I don't have to me nice to him....or even actually hand the food to him.\"  I'm in a wheelchair so the food fell in my lap.  The lasagna was actually on it's side instead of laying flat so it was all over the container.  I don't know if she works for the restaurant or Grub Hub.  The food was awful so I'm guessing she works for Giuseppe's, but I don't know.  As I said, lasagna is my favorite dish.  I've had it all over the country (I've lived in 9 states and visited many more).  This was easily the most bland lasagna I've ever had.  Not only that, it's more expensive than all the other places I've ordered from (I don't mind paying for quality) and it didn't come with a salad.  One place I usually get lasagna from is a few bucks cheaper and comes with a salad.  So, this was a massive disappointment.....the fact is was all over the container because it was literally thrown to me and on it's side didn't help.  The turkey sandwich was decent.  However, the fries that came with it were greasy, cold and limp.  They literally looked like they had been sitting in some basket for half a day that someone forgot about and decided to throw them in with this order instead of throwing them out.  Decided to get the chicken fingers with their garlic sauce.  The only word I can think of is \"nasty.\"  That stuff was really gross.  They also didn't come with any fries, when most restaurants include them.  Seeing as how awful their fries are, that's probably a good thing.  If you're in a wheelchair, you better hope she doesn't bring your food to you because she will literally throw it to you instead of handing it to you.    And if you want food that isn't awful, I'd suggest a different place because I haven't been that disappointed in a very long time.  There have been times I didn't think the food was great, but it's rare I think the food is just awful/bland......which this was."}
{"text":"One of the best bars in town. Jessa is the most amazing bartender serving great drinks and awesome food. Great service industry hang out after work. Show some love and get it back here. Feel so much at home."}
{"text":"Came here because we saw that LVAC members get 20% off and it happened to be happy hour as well. The dining area is a little bit more formal so we opted for the bar/patio seating. They have a wide range of wines and have happy hour every day from 4-7. Our server was funny and entertaining! He made suggestions and was very prompt. We got the roasted vegetable platter and some salads which were both great. We will definitely be back for half off wine bottles on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Food...meh. Machines are always, always, always tight. Cocktails are super stiff and cig smoke is kinda \"come and go\". Bring clothes you are comfy in. No dress code. Everyone is friendly. Super friendly."}
{"text":"This place is nice, but still comfortable. The food is excellent. The house red wine was good. I had Parmesan crusted chicken, and it was excellent"}
{"text":"Amazing staff since we arrive, they have a good happy hour and the house wine is amazing, Cristina was amazing and the hostess was so nice !! Food amazing !! Just 5 starts for this Italian local place !"}
{"text":"Second time here and loving it! Service is great, food is SOOOOO good, and the atmosphere is a casual classic Italian vibe. I would recommend this in a heartbeat to all my friends, coworkers and even strangers! Best Italian in town!"}
{"text":"This was our FOURTH stop on the trek and this is a place we like just for the food and drink.  The prices are good on drinks and the food and service is always good here.  We came back on this day because we saw a sign saying they were going to be serving Corned Beef on St. Patricks day.  Well the Corned Beef had a great taste, the potatoes were some of the best we had throughout the day and since I am writing this after St. Patricks Day, I can say the potatoes here were the best we had all day.  I am not sure how they cooked their Corned Beef but it was some of the best we had on this day.  Our party was just two of us and as always the service was great on this day.  This was one of the only places we came across which was having some festivities around 7pm on this day but of course we did not stay as we had other places to stop at on our trek for St. Patricks day.  This is a place that has rarely ever disappointed and is a place we will continue to return to for the food, the drinks and the fellowship as they have some great people working here and we have always felt like you are walking into a family members home."}
{"text":"Food is very good. The Italian Beef Sandwhich is a winner. Eaten here several times and food has always been very good. The service is horrible. Make sure you have a lot of time as they seem to be about as  slow as you get. You think with the Yelp reviews they would get it right. Owner must be asleep at the wheel. Great Food...Terrible Service!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out because I heard it had really good bar food. Sure enough, it definitely has some tasty Italian staples that has had me coming back frequently. The chicken alfredo is creamy and rich. The chicken pieces are grilled and flavorful. Spaghetti and meatballs is another solid choice. Sauce tastes like it has been cooking down in a low simmer, giving it a rich tomato flavor you would find in a restaurant. That being said, the times that I have been there unless I was getting a drink or dining in, they would forget to add extra sauce that I paid for and/or the service has been spotty.  The guy that works late (which I'm pretty sure is the owner) can be really nice and when he is there the order is consistent and correct. He always checks the bag before handing it to me. However, during late late night there is a shift change and a lady server that comes on board (didn't get her name) and she is the opposite of the guy that I have interacted with. She hardly greets you as you come in and every encounter seems to be an inconvenience. When asked if the extra sauces are in the bag, the reply was, \"What? Of course it is.\" I open the bag and boxes there and it wasn't. I didn't even say anything as she stared at the missing goods and then trots off to get the sauce. Comes back and says \"Here you go. \" No apologies and the apathy was strong in this one. It has gotten so bad that I have been planning on ordering my food around the time I don't think this person is working. I have seen another bar patron say something to her when his drink was wrong and she literally laughed it off. He didn't seem amused and I didn't stick around as I grabbed my food to go.  In the end, this place does have some solid Italian food, but the action and attitude of one worker has almost made me lose my appetite to return. I will probably give this place another try or end up going to their Durango location in the future, but I just want my food without the attitude from the one girl."}
{"text":"If you want to eat here, only order to go.  Also the trio-mac and cheese was delicious and well portion for $11. But I would never go back since the service was awful. It took over an hour and a half for one person to get sat, eat, and pay. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Been here for dinner twice recently.  The first time was on a busy Sat night and everything was perfect.  Hostess was friendly & polite, seated us right away.  Food was very good and our waitress was very accommodating.  Prices were quite reasonable.  Tried going back a week or so later and that time ran into a rude hostess who seemed annoyed that we came in -- so we left.  Went back a week or so later, requested the same waitress as before from the cheerful hostess.  The food was fine, but it took forever to get our order (it was a rainy night & they weren't busy at all)."}
{"text":"Tonight, the owners and partners invited family, friends, and nearby business members for a grand opening party. Wonderful turnout and everything was on point. The staff was attentive and friendly, the food was constantly coming out fresh, and the drinks were pouring! The restaurant is beautiful! I had never been into the establishment that was here prior, but I've been told that it's basically the same layout. It's much larger than it looks from the outside; it has four separate dining areas and an open bar area that is just all-around inviting. Gorgeous fixtures and I love the privacy of two of the dining rooms. Also, the patio dining area is very nice! Oh, and they have a bad ass digital jukebox music player thing in the bar area, very cool.  We had the opportunity to sample a few of their dishes, however, I feel that I can't fairly judge them on mass production or catering/buffet-style (when they're not meant that way). Overall, everything was good. We tried their pasta with meat sauce (pretty sure it was Bombardoni pasta), meatballs in marinara, Italian sausage and peppers, three types of pizza, calamari, mozzarella sticks, Antipasti, and desserts. The pasta was good, but I didn't care for the meat in the sauce. Same with the meatballs and the sausage (although the sausage was better). Marinara was good and complemented the fresh calamari. They did completely different types of pizza, but common was the yummy dough. I liked the thinner crust version better and one had a sesame bottom like a hamburger bun that was actually fun and yummy! The desserts weren't exciting, but I did really enjoy the apple turnover.  Great experience, however, the food was just okay for me. I definitely like the location and the atmosphere. And it's certainly a nice place to drink and relax. Anyway, I'll be back to try some of my favorite Italian dishes and reevaluate my feelings about the food."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant and waited in the lobby to be seated. Stood there for about ten minutes and no one came to seat us. I saw someone leaving the kitchen multiple times, and even upon seeing us we were still not attended to. Terrible service. We will go to one of the other hundred Italian restaurants out there."}
{"text":"I come here often for happy hour great bartenders,  great food and drinks, plus it's close to my home."}
{"text":"Food was very good, service was excellent. I didn't care for the water fountain that was exceptionally loud. I felt like I could smell smoke from the bar, no one else at the table smelled it though."}
{"text":"The best calamari and shrimp fettuccini I've had in Las Vegas! My hubby's order- lasagna was also delicious!!! Half off wine for happy hour was an added bonus - super impressed!"}
{"text":"I will be back! I stopped in after work at 11:45pm. They serve their whole menu and the drinks are half off after midnight! I got the Mozzarella Encrusted Chicken. It was good. Large dish. I have lunch for tomorrow! Most importantly--it was very clean and and a chill atmosphere. The bartender was very friendly and welcoming. The bar area is comfortable. Great for people dining single or with a friend."}
{"text":"Wow! What have I been missing? Heard about this place and had been meaning to go for awhile. I finally did today.   When you enter, the restaurant is on the left and the bar to the right. We were promptly greeted and seated. She asked for our drink orders and went to get them for us. She also came back with a basket of bread and butter. The bread was so good.   It's not a very large menu but has a nice selection - pasta, pizza, salad, hamburgers, sandwiches, etc.   I had been told the French dip was really good, so I went with that minus the mushrooms. My son ordered the chicken Parmesan. The portion was huge. Tons of roast beef on the sandwich and too many French fries. The sandwich was amazing. Honestly probably one of the best French dips I've ever had. It was huge. I only ate half. French fries were good too, crispy and not at all greasy. Reminded me of fries from an air fryer. I didn't try my son's food but he said it was very good.   I also looked over the breakfast menu which looked delicious as well.   I was actually surprised how inexpensive the food was, especially for the amount received.   The restaurant ambiance is very nice and actually would be kind of a romantic place to take a date and not spend a ton of money.   Service was great. Waitress kept apologizing because there were several large parties however her service did not suffer at all.   I will most definitely go back. Many other things to try. Wish I would have discovered this place much sooner."}
{"text":"Most of the food ranges from 3.5-4 stars but the service at the bar here is 5 star service (especially on the grave shifts) making the dining experience that much better and one of my very favorite gaming bars in this area. Get the ribeye! Delicious!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. The bartenders are friendly and the food is amazing! The other night I ordered the Insalada Caprese . My boyfriend ordered the chicken fingers with fries. The salad was delicious! The right size and had great flavor. The fries were amazing! They were fresh cut and not frozen. He got the chicken fingers mild I prefer spicy but it was still just as good and juicy. Tonight my boyfriend ordered the California club breakfast burrito and won't stop raving about how good it is.  This will be our new late hang out. Love the great specials and deals they offer."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for someone to at least take a drink order. Nothing... zilch...they weren't even busy...never going back there again."}
{"text":"Disregard the negative reviews and take it from someone hard to please...This restaurant should be your first choice for Italian. I did as I usually do and sample a dish with an Alfredo base. If an Italian restaurant can't do Alfredo right I never return. Long story short...it was the best Fettuccine Alfredo I'd ever had. The service was top notch and the experience far better than the price tag indicated. As I looked around I saw a lot of happy faces. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!  Very clean restaurant!  I will go back soon."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They are open 24 hours a day, and serve the full menu all day!  Great choices, and literally everything I've ever had there is great.  Prices are fair, and staff is friendly, and will remember you!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is good, I have to say our waitress Elaine was wonderful! The rating is 3.5 stars for the food and 5 stars for Elaine . When ever I come into town to visit my parents, they bring me here. Elaine is my favorite of the waitress's and waiters we have had over the 10 years they have lived here."}
{"text":"My friend literally is always raving about Giuseppe's and after along shopping trip she asked what I wanted for dinner and she knows I'm not picky and up for anything so this is where she brought me. They have a bar also but we sat in the dining area which was beautiful and huge. Our server was very friendly and helpful in recommending some dishes since I've never eaten here before. There was a $10 menu with menu items on it so we figured why not give that a try. I ordered the pork chop Marsala with pappardelle and my bestie ordered the chicken and sausage cacciatore with pappardelle as well. We received some bread with oils and vinegar to start while we waited for our food. Nothing fancy just sliced French bread would have been better heated up as it was a bit cold. When we recieved our food I was surprised at the portion especially for $10! The pork chop Marsala I initially thought was drowning in sauce but as I ate more of the pasta it wasn't too much sauce as some of the noodles needed some. The chicken and sausage cacciatore had a huge amount of meat and sauce but needed more noodles to suffice the amount of meat they give no complaints. Both dishes were very delicious but we agreed the Marsala was the winner. The savory Marsala sauce was so good I could have eaten that alone. The pork chop was very tender and The pappardelle noodles on both were cooked just perfect and I'm almost certain they were made fresh. I would definitely come back to try more of the menu especially the pork Marsala. So delicious. Giuseppe's is definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"My parents brought me here since I've just made the decision to be vegan and they knew there were options there so I could enjoy a dinner out without just eating a salad.  Our waitress Christina was very attentive and was very helpful when it came to my new diet.  The ambience was very dim and romantic. My father is a senior citizen and had to say that it was too dark and too loud but I enjoyed it. The prices were very reasonable and overall we had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Came here with two of my best girl friends after a long week of work. It was a spur of a moment decision to go here but we are so glad we decided to come here. We were instantly greeted by a nice lady at the front and seated right away. The booth comfortably sat the three of us and the atmosphere of the restaurant was very elegant and relaxed. There are two separate seating areas. The bar and the dining area (we sat in the dining area). Our waiter was very courteous and frequently checked up on us. One of my friends and I ordered some red wine for our dinner and the waiter gave our other friend a complimentary drink to join in our merriment. It was a pleasant surprise and really showcased the customer service they had here. The prices were affordable and seemed standard to most Italian restaurants I've been to. We ordered the Mac & Cheese Balls for an app and got 2 of the Angel Hair pasta with Chicken (I can't remember the name, unfortunately). The Mac & Cheese Balls were delicious and the portions were huge. They also offered free soft and delicious bread with olive oil and butter. The pasta was delicious and had the perfect amount of sauce. The chicken was cooked well and wasn't dry or overcooked. The lady who greeted us at the front also checked up on us and had a conversation with us. It really felt welcomed and it was great to see that kind of customer service. My only gripe would be the Witch mannequin they had by our table and by the entrance of the dining area. Everytime someone walked by, the witch decoration would go off and continuously cackle. It got annoying through the night. Overall, I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Worst red sauce I've ever had in my life and I am Italian and I have been from northern Italy to southern Italy in every major city and town. Not to mention I've eaten all across the country as well and had Italian food in all major cities in America. I love all different peoples sauce and I'm not expecting it to be like my mothers like most people I love trying different styles. Their marinara was disgusting and I don't even know what they use as a tomato base but it was very bizarre and cheap tasting. This is no exaggeration Prego and Ragu are way better than their sauces. I can't even believe their in business because of this alone. The pasta was over cooked. I did try my mother's pasta and that sauce was the same, really bad. The Marsala was incredibly average. I will say the service was good and it's a nice environment even though I was confused by plain white paper covering the tables over the linen."}
{"text":"Picked this place while in Henderson just off the Yelp reviews.  We were there mid-afternoon so it was pretty empty.  Honestly, I could do without the white linen table cloths...a bit dated, but the food was really good.  I am gluten-free so I had the cran-feta chopped salad and wasn't disappointed although I would've loved to try one of the pasta dishes instead.  My hubby had his old stand-by...chicken parm and he loved it.  Would go back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for either a night of cocktails and gambling, or a romantic dinner for some of the best Italian food in Vegas.  From the chicken parmigiana, to the sliders, to the pizza.  Everything is top notch.  Bartenders and wait staff are friendly and always accommodating.  I have never had less than w five star experience here.  One of my favorite gambling spots in vegas!"}
{"text":"Not impressed  at alll. I drive by this place on my way to work and i finally decided to  try it. On arrival hostess  was nice seated us quickly. Wasnt busy at all.  I ordered  the  chicken marsala and dinner salad . Waitress asked if we wanted bread wasn't sure if it was free. Said yes  bread was ok. Salad was great best part of my dinner. Main dish came was huge portion of pasta and chicken . Seemed over cooked the sauce wasn't  very good no mushrooms. My friend had the lasagna  again huge portion. I tasted it was luke warm. Desert tirimousou  huge desert nothing special. Waitress was ok. Seemed bored. I wont go  back  ."}
{"text":"February 25, 2015 approximately 7:30 PM  My wife and I decided to come to this restaurant because the night before we went through a Wendy's drive-through and the funny character employee handling the drive-through after hours highly recommended this place. He said he worked there as a second job.   Being the fact that we both love Italian food, I was pumped to check it out. When we first walked in we were greeted and seated and our waitress was Christie. (sorry if it's Christie with a Y) Christie is a very nice and conscientious waitress that catered to us so wonderfully, I can't say enough good things about her.  We started with the eggplant parmesan appetizer. It was cooked to perfection and tasted very good.  We then ordered a wedge salad which was to die for.  My wife ordered linguine with clam sauce as the main entrée and I ordered a small thin crust five toppings supreme pizza cooked slightly well done. It was so good, just writing about it now is making my mouth water (and I'm still full).  Christie kept our drinks full at all times and by the end of the meal she asked if we wanted dessert. I only ate about half of a small pizza, so I had just enough room left to go for it. I ordered the seven layer chocolate fudge cake with a side scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was a huge portion and so decadent, yet not overbearing.  My wife and I are new to the area and in between all the great service Christie was providing us, she also told us about some local attractions and things to do, which was very nice.  Overall, the restaurant interior is beautiful, there is an interesting waterfall that comes from the ceiling, which I noticed was a little bit on the loud side, but not annoying. However I did find the music that was being played was in competition with the sound of the water falling. With all the other patrons in the restaurant and the overall ambience, it was not bad.  It is a tad bit pricey, but well worth the money considering the quality of the food. You definitely get what you pay for in this world and being the fact that we ordered so much food I was shocked that the bill was so low.  I would highly recommend this restaurant. If you have the pleasure of Christie being your waitress, you're in for a very nice evening."}
{"text":"I had my graduation party here and had an incredible experience. The room can seat up to 40 and was beautifully decorated for the holiday. I selected a pizza buffet and the food was terrific! A variety of different pizzas (meat lovers, vegetarian, margarita, etc.) plus salad and pasta were served and the guests throughly enjoyed. The service was fantastic as well---very attentive and helpful throughout the event. Highly recommend for your next event--- or just to stop by for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Love the cran feta salad! Christina is amazing! We'll be back on another special occasion for sure!"}
{"text":"Great find  Delicious fresh authentic Italian food  Had the chicken Marsala was so flavorful and the meatball sub was fresh tasted homemade  Highly recommend it  Key lime pie was delightful  Only downfall we sat near the door where bar was and smoke was coming through"}
{"text":"Last Thursday  around 4:00 I brought my wedding party of 6 in for a quick drink on our way to the chapel. There was 2, maybe 3 people sitting at the bar, and 2 people behind the bar. No one greeted us or acknowledged our presence, for a good 4-5 minutes. One bartender a bald male with a Pittsburg Steelers jersey on, Lambert it said on the back I believe, was EXTREMELY rude. He not only ignored us, but started laughing inappropiately. He kept walking past my party ignoring us laughing never asking what we needed, joking with the other bartender who was cashing out her drawer. One of my guests loudly said, \" We're on our way to a wedding can we get a drink? The equally rude female bartender said \" if one of you is ordainded and you're in that much of a hurry, get married in the parking lot\". I have never felt so disrespected  simply trying to get a drink in a bar. When he FINALLY took our drink order he counldn't remember them and asked us 4-5 times what we wanted. I think he was drunk. I have been here before, and I will NEVER go there again. Oh, and Lambert, 4 out of the 6 of us are bartenders. Only one with a huge heart gave that un-deserved $10 tip."}
{"text":"So, as I am a frequent flyer at the Giuseppe on Durango, I was told to try the Henderson, Nevada location out. So, since I was in the area, I decided to take a friend there and try it out.  Well, to my surprise it was more of a \"family\" eatery then I excepted.  I was seated by a hostess who was friendly and acknowledged me quickly. There was no wait, so I was seated promptly.  Within 2 minutes, Christian, the server introduced herself and started the process.  We ordered the Chicken Lombardy, and Chick Parm.  I must say the fact the food came out piping out and quickly, with a full dining room was fabulous. I could not even get through two pieces of bread before the food was delivered. ( I normally eat all 4 pieces before the food is delivered). The food as normal was delicious, but to add to the night, my friend who has been in Clark County for over 30 years, has never walked into this eatery and will be visiting it more often.  As always, I ask for the manager, I believe his name was Al. he treated me as I am used to from the other location.  Always friendly, and making me feel at home, like I would from the east coast.  ** If you are new to the Henderson area, it is a must try place."}
{"text":"Pasta was mediocre the meatballs tasted funky. A smell came from the pasta or bar I couldn't tell which one but it started when I received the pasta. The bartender was great very prompt and friendly. I will probably not be back . Kind of shame because it's close to my house and I heard great things about this place."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. I have only eaten in the bar for happy hours about 3 times. The happy hour menu is mostly Italian dishes. All of the food selections are amazing. Great quality of food and selection. This place is so amazing that I live in the northwest valley near Santa Fe Station and have been here 3 times for the apps. Great place ! Wish they had one in my area around Centennial"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour. Wow, this place is amazing! We had calamari (my fave),  wings, procuitto, mozzarella salad, and eggplant parmigiana. The food was fresh, well prepared and very tasty, and the portions were a good size. There were 2 of us and we couldn't even come close to finishing it all! It's a family owned and operated place and the service was exceptional, and very friendly. They had a really great looking menu with some $10 dinners but we couldn't get past the apps! We will be back soon and this place will be on our regular rotation now."}
{"text":"Half price happy hour appetizers aren't half off the regular menu. The Happy Hour appetizer menu is 30 to  35 percent off the the regular menu. Waiter said he knew the problem, but the menu had lots of errors. But, I ordered an appetizer, sausage in a pepper, which I was told could be spicy. Talk about bland, bordering on tasteless. What a waste. But better than the meat lasgna. Again bland sauce with meat that I could only describe to my wife as what I envision dog meat to taste like.  When the waiter delivered our meals, he said he would return in a couple of minutes to check on the meals. I guess he noticed that I wasn't eating mine, so he only came by to pick up the plates. At that time he asked me if I liked the lasgna. I said not at all, and no I didn't want it wrapped up. Not another word from the waiter although I was surprised he took 50% off my dish.  Defintely not going back."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing.  Super kid friendly.  Not a kid atmosphere but they do have a kids menu.  Everyone was super nice and the food was very good.  Glad we stopped  by.   I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Place looks good on the inside, service was terrible though. Waited 5 minutes to order our waters, he asked if we wanted lemon. We all said no and they all came with lemons. Server was awkward (never even said hi or gave his name) and we didn't have silverware when our salads came.  He also took my fork with my salad plate so I asked him for another when the entrees arrived. He never brought it so after a couple minutes of sitting there with food in front of me but no way to eat it, I had to get one myself from another table. After we had paid he then decided to tell us about their happy hour specials 17 minutes after it was over. They have $2 draft beers which sounded really nice and I would've considered that had he suggested it 30 minutes ago. Food was really good so that saved them from one star"}
{"text":"Food was great...Love that they have a $10.00 menu for dinner...Great for seniors......no longer have the $10 menu"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as a friend of ours works as a waitress here but it was bad, really bad.  My husband says that his food tasted like it had been frozen and reheated.  My salad was nothing special and my kids weren't fans of the pizza which is bizarre.  The seats were torn and the service was okay.  Next..."}
{"text":"We were craving Italian tonight and were looking to try a new spot so of course I went to Yelp for help. Its really sad when you search for Italian food and Fazoli's and Olive Garden are in the top 10.   We decided to try Giuseppe's since it was close by and we have driven by it several times wanting to try it.   We were greeted quickly and sat down in the main restaurant. There is also a separate bar which is attached but enclosed. I wasn't expecting much with the \"24 hour gaming\" sign out front but must admit the decor and ambiance inside was very nice. They had an open kitchen which I usually like, but we could see the cooks wearing backwards baseball caps. Not a very professional image when in view of customers.   Our waitress arrived within a few minutes. We had to ask about any specials since she didn't mention any, even though we told her it was our fist time there.  They had a Tuscan trio which was Fettuccine Alfredo, Parmesan chicken and eggplant parm. She asked if we wanted a salad so we chose a ceasar.   The salad came quickly but it was very sad looking. Just some lettuce thrown on a plate with some croutons and a couple shavings of cheese. It was very dry as well. The entree came and was presented nicely. The Parmesan chicken was cooked well and was pretty good. The other two were very bland.   The eggplant parm was extremely bland, even with cheese and tomato sauce on it, it had no seasoning. The alfredo was also very bland. I ate about half my meal and that was enough for me. Quite disappointing.   Our bill came and $4.00 was added for the salads. I don't care that it was only $4.00 but I do care since we were told soup or salad came with dinner. When I asked our waitress she said the special did not come with salad and she apologized for not being clear on that.   I guess our search of great authentic Italian food will continue."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday evening for group party, my first visit and surely my last.  Most of the staff were ok but this one waiter/busboy injected himself into our conversation and was extremely rude.  Seemed a little full of himself but obviously working with the public is not his forte.   Food was just \"ok\" but the decor was nice.  Too many places to choose from with better food and nicer staff for me to ever go back."}
{"text":"Waterfall is too loud  I had gnocchi, just blah.  Not bad but not good either.   Wife had beef on weck bland beef and certainly not a good bun.    Great place to come for a cocktail and hang out but get your dinner somewhere elser"}
{"text":"Great food , drink, and atmosphere. Love the staff and the pizza is the some of the best in town. Lounge is fun with gaming, music, nice TVs, and seating. Recommended to everybody!!!"}
{"text":"Well, to start with when we sat down the little dishes on the table were dirty.  I told the waiter and he said OH and never took them away.  I ordered Moscato wine and he brought me a glass of some fizzie wine.  Then after we got our meal I was served French fries and I had ordered their home made potato chips and the waiter simply said that is what you ordered and walked away.  It seems they are too busy to be polite.  I will give it a miss and go somewhere where they are friendly.  Very disappointing!!!!!"}
{"text":"WORST customer service. The bigger bearded guy behind the bar is racist and he was being very rude and aggressive. I assume he is fired by now but his actions definitely ruined our night. He was trying to rid of my brother and I who were playing video poker at the bar top. Lots of open seat and other older people who weren't even playing but he asked us to leave because we only had $10 in the machine each!! We have been going to Giuseppe's for their food for 2 years and we know the lady bartender Vessie who is really nice and always gives great service. This night we had ordered $235 worth of food and we were asked to leave because we were only playing $20??? I wish I could give 0 stars to this establishment."}
