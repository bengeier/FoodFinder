{"text":"De bons plats italiens comme Mamie en faisait en Toscane. Mais pourquoi paye-t-on la bouffe familiale aux prix de la haute cuisine ?

Ce qu'il y a de plus agréable dans ce resto, c'est la terrasse. Elle ne donne pas sur la rue, mais se trouve plutôt dans une allée entre deux vieux immeubles en brique. Cela ne manque pas de charme - surtout les nuits d'été - et donne aux clients l'impression de participer à la fameuse scène de La belle et le clochard.

La cuisine n'est pas mal, mais n'a vraiment rien d'exceptionnel non plus. Chaque plat que je goûtais me donnait l'impression de pouvoir faire aussi bien chez moi. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, mais ce n'est pas acceptable à ces prix-là. Au moins les portions étaient assez copieuses.

En gros, ça allait, mais je ne crois pas que j'y reviendrai tout de suite."}

Fabulous food and attentive service.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant has seating inside, and than opens up to a hidden terrasse in the middle of the building. It was a perfect place for lunch on a sunny day. The down side to this is that there was construction happening inside several offices surrounding the this space, which was very loud and took away from the experience. 

The food was able to make up for the loud construction. I had a Cesar salad followed by pasta with prosciutto and mushrooms in a rose sauce all washed down with a glass of Carpineto Dogajoli Rosato (Rosé). 

Overall, very nice place for lunch or dinner in the summer, excellent for a meeting or date. Definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, great food, but the service was too slow and casual for my liking. I will go back there for sure, as this place is a tiny european oasis that blooms with Italy's charm. Oh and just like in Italy, the waiters are slow and casual, as if its their day off, take their time to chat and walk around. It just got a bit frustrating at the end, we waited 40 minutes for the bill, but the food was so full of love and flavor that it compensates for the slow service. Try it!
Almost forgot, they have the best tiramisu that I tried in Montreal!"}
{"text":"precut bread with packaged butter
really good appetizers and reasonably priced but very mediocre pasta and particularly the chicken was rubber"}
{"text":"This restaurant makes you feel special. The staff are very polite and nice. Outside area is full of flowers and quiet, you may forgot that you are in the middle of down town. The main dish prepared artistically and it is super delicious. Do not forget to have dessert there. tiramisu is well made."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to Il Cortile and it was consistent and delicious on all occasions.

This restaurant is tucked away in Sherbrooke West, they have a cute, little courtyard hideaway outside with plants and flowers where you can enjoy your meal in the sunshine if you don't want to eat inside.

It was a beautiful weekday afternoon and my mom and I had run a few errands then went shopping nearby, we both hadn't eaten breakfast and decided to go to Il Cortile to enjoy lunch outside.

It was busy when we arrived, our waiter greeted us and let us choose where we wanted to sit, crusty bread and butter soon arrived, glasses were filled with water and wine was ordered while we browsed through the menu.

We both started with the eggplant parmesana, I ordered the linguine poppette and my mom had the lemon veal scaloppine.

Our eggplant soon arrived, absolutely delicious and a perfect starter size. Nothing bitter or overly salty, I was already full after my last bite and knew I wouldn't be able to finish all of my linguine.

We enjoyed the warm sunshine on our faces and the chatter around us while we waited for our main courses to arrive.

My linguine was perfectly all dente, the tomato based sauce was fresh, beautiful flavor and the 2 veal meatballs were juicy, tender and melt in your mouth delicious.
I had a few bites and asked to bring the rest home.

My mom's veal was also delicious, served wit fresh, sautéed vegetable and a little side of pasta.

We waited for the bill and my leftovers, I soon found out that they had thrown it out by accident and made a fresh one to bring home. Very kind:)

All in all, a perfect, little Italian restaurant that is great for a special occasion or a quiet, relaxed meal.

I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this restaurant. Started off with the boccocini and tomatoes. Nothing special. Should have ordered something else. Large variety of choices for entree. Ordered the spagettini with baby clams. Very delicious. I was pleasantly surprised. Dessert was spumoni. Very good! Total bill was Not cheap but very satisfying. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I would be simply embarrassed to charge customers money for the quality of food they serve at this restaurant.  Not only all the seafood in my dish was over cooked but it just had no taste-  we were a group of people and not only one but some  had to return their food and didn't even bother to order more as they knew it wasn't going to be good based on the quality and taste of their first bite- 

My other friend had the Tuna steak although the presentation was ok...it was undeniably over cooked and she said it simply tasted like chicken- through the night, she kept on expressing how pissed she was for having picked that main plate and not another-  my partner selected the pappardelle and again, he didn't even bother to complain - literally gave up on the plate just to give you and idea ....

I only give 1 star for the setup and the decoration of the place - otherwise I would have not even bother to write this down-

Very disappointing and  I hope I would never be invited for any sort of celebration here.

By the way, our waiter seemed like he had a bad day and just couldn't help it but to put his grump upon us the entire night - 

Big difference in having a Cook rather than a Chef...
The quality and food is resented"}
{"text":"Poor staffs, crappy waiter, he treated me impolitely without any smile in 2 hours !!!! 
I won't come back here. 
At last, the food was decent !"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now.  Best to go in the summer and ask to sit on the small patio... you are sort of in an alley way but makes you feel like you are in little italy new york!   Good food, at this nice little find which you would not normally walk in to."}
{"text":"Great Italian food, many selections of food and wine. The courtyard dining was very romantic. You could be dressy or casual.the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Pasta al pesto: flavorless and drenched with oil!
Eggplant parmigiana: eggplants as hard as a shoe sole and very scarse amount of cheese
Overpriced, tacky!
They should not even be listed on Yelp....."}
{"text":"Beautiful courtyard which transports you away from downtown Montreal. Good food and good service. Not to miss especially for lunch or dinner in the summer time."}
