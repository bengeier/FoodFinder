{"text":"For what it was the food was good. Apperance was good. Service took a few minutes to come over. Once she greeted us things went well."}
{"text":"my friend & I always come in on Thursday for drinks. I always play a maximum $60 or more on the machine. we ordered another round & were given a bill. The bartender was super rude & and gave us a bill. I understand my friend had to pay her bill because she was not playing.., but I had put $50 in the the machine., why did I have to pay. We will never come back. I wish I got the names of the bartenders who took over chrystals shift . .They are so rude. Ive been in the gaming business forever & I would never deal with these so called bartenders. (its a joke).Good luck, because your going to need it.. If you want good service, go to pts pub across the street, they no how to treat regulars. Kopper Keg, YOU SUCK!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretzel bites for the best thing ever! Chris the waiter is one of the best waiters in town. He even re opened the dining room for us one night when we came in 10 mins past closing! Very tasty for being \"bar food.\" Certainly recommend and try and get Chris!"}
{"text":"cool place with an easy, laid-back atmosphere. it had a decent staff when i was there"}
{"text":"Yeah. When I told you we were OK with our drinks, I didn't think I would have to text your personal cell phone to get your attention because that's where most of your attention was focused. We sat for over 15 minutes without drinks because when we hailed you down, your response was \"Oh, you guys are staying? \"  Gee, I thought service ended when we left the bar.  I guess not.  If you have a Sunday afternoon free,  choose a place that actually values locals and does more than comp 1 drink max.  The food is good and the venue is great for sports, but at $6 a beer, WHEN YOU CAN GET ONE, I would skip Kopper Keg.  And let me say, this is the 3rd and last try.  Even at different shifts, the service remains extremely poor."}
{"text":"I have been to plenty of bars in this town, used to go here all the time, it has been going down hill fast. For the manager reading I give you this post in hopes to help your bar out. First off, the dollar a hand keno is too much for comped drinks, only bar I have been to that does this. The bartenders let you know you need to play a dollar to get comped. Second the bartenders should introduce themselves by name. There is also something about giving a little to get customers to come back, I see this at the very successful bars. I looked around and the bar was empty and hardly anyone was gambling. My friend asked to have the TV changed to a hockey game and the bartenders said no. I understand the bar business is tough, but I think the bartenders are hurting the business as we will never go back, remedys is a perfect example of why the bar is successful, the bartenders are great and friendly. They go out of their way to make you feel good."}
{"text":"The burgers are actually pretty good, which is the soul reason I gave two stars. The service is poor and not very friendly both at the bar and with the servers. No drink specials when we went in and they charge way too much for drinks. Charged me for crown royal when I ordered well. The food is this place's only redeeming quality and that's not nearly enough to bring us back."}
{"text":"Service and food remains quite good.

Prices edged up a bit.

Many TV's positioned around the dining area for viewing. Same in the bar area."}
{"text":"This is an a-ok spot. It's like most other chain, locals, drinking gaming bars around town. The bar area is dark and usually comprised of regulars. It's never really crowded. The restaurant area is small and ho-hum in terms of ambiance and decor. The service, though, (at least on Tuesday nights) is really great. The beers on draft are better than average. Their menu is fairly extensive with a good number of options. And while not tasty enough to crave, it's tasty enough to eat again. All in all, this is a decent neighborhood bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"I must say the customer service here is outstanding. They have an excellent crew on day shift. Shannon is the bartender on days that came from Half Shell. She's outstanding! 
The food is good, the entire staff is friendly, and the machines are loose cause they get a lot of play. I always have a great time when I come here.
This is a awesome neighborhood bar. I give them two thumbs up and a 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"The food ain't too shabby with prices typical of a local gaming bar. Drinks are average priced too. Service from the bartenders has always been hit or miss for me. The bartenders don't serve food so they aren't overtaxed like most bartenders at other places yet they tend to regularly ignore  and treat myself and coworkers like they are annoyed with having to refresh drinks. The guy server who serves food only absolutely is fantastic. Too bad the bartenders don't act like him. He should teach them a little about customer service. This place deserves 4 stars if the bar staff can be more attentive"}
{"text":"One of my neighborhood go to bars after work. Tyne staff is always friendly and welcoming. I love the variety and availability of bar top machines. Their selection of draught beers and ciders is standard but they have plenty. A great atmosphere is your looking for a place to relax, have a couple drinks and play some games."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised on how good the food was. The sampler platter was great. Wings are a good price and they aren't breaded which is really good. Service was really quick."}
{"text":"What a surprise THIS place turned out to be! My friend Brion and I were meeting for breakfast, and since he's from Vegas, he was picking. Well, the place HE picked wasn't open at 5am (which was when we were meeting) so I suggested the Kopper Keg because it was almost right across the street from where I'd just made a delivery, and it looked \"Open\". 

I parked my truck around back (lots of parking at 5am!) and he parked right in front of the door. Perfect.

Very quickly we were greeted my Sarah, a happy, friendly, and quick to laugh young lady who actually seemed to like her job. We got menus and made our selections. 

I opted for the Corned Beef Hash with eggs and toast. Oh, and country fries with it as well. Not sure what Brion ordered, but it was BIG, and he wolfed it all down.

When my selection came, it was PERFECT! The hash was crispy through and through (just as I'd ordered), and my fries were also well crisped - as I ordered. I'm liking this place already! 

This is a classy looking sports bar. There's TV's everywhere, so no matter where you sit you can see several. Each one has something else showing (football, tennis, golf, auto racing, baseball - you name it). I wish I lived near a place like this. I'd go broke hanging out there. It looks like it's a lot of fun in the evenings when the place is packed. But for our casual, intimate breakfast it was fine. We had a few years of tales to catch up on. 

Sarah made her presence known just often enough to refill coffee cups and water glasses. 

The menu looks fairly well represented by all sorts of options. I think if you can't find something here to eat, you should just quit eating..."}
{"text":"All was excellent don't miss out food and beverages on point Chris lee will make you feel welcomed every time"}
{"text":"Wow!!! I've worked in the industry for 12 years. I walked in here after my swing shift and Richie the bartender was so welcoming and very attentive and all around amazing! Bartenders like Richie are exactly why I prefer pubs and gaming bars in the community as opposed to the strip.  Definitely making this my new go to and bringing my friends.  Last but not least, BEST micheladas in town!!"}
{"text":"Place where the locals come to hang out.  Plenty of TVs to watch sports."}
{"text":"I always have a good time here. The Bartenders are what makes this place. Headlined by the best Chris. Many times you go somewhere and the staff has no personality. That is not the case here. Chris will make you feel like this is your version of Cheers."}
{"text":"First time here and really enjoyed it.  Chris and Robyn were really cool bartenders.  JB served our food and it was delish!

I got the BOMB ASS prime rib and the wifey got a regular hamburger with sweet potato fries. We really enjoyed the food and service. 

Then we played some video poker.  I got dealt 4 6's on my 3rd hand and cashed out!!!

Yay!!!"}
{"text":"Here for lunch with Yvonne , after going to Star Nursery , very convenient nice place, Sandy was our server, she was so pleasant and  very attentive .
We wanted something light , Sandy suggested one of the daily specials , a ground turkey burger, it was exceptionally good right down to the avocado.
Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My Dad dropped his wallet and medications out the car door. Honesty running rampant within the doors, not only did a wonderful customer turn them in but, it was hand delivered to our house by a awesome staff member. Food is great, as is the staff; the dining room is my favorite here close to home... good going everyone"}
{"text":"The waitress are friendly, but, just a little slow. The breakfast special is priced great for what you get, but the eggs could have been done a little bit more.  But, on a up note, I finally found a cook that understands what, crispy hash browns mean. Over all it was not bad."}
{"text":"The hunt for darts lead us here. Not many places carry a dart board for some reason. It is a disappointment. I know throwing sharp objects while drunk does not sound like a safe idea. That's okay, give me an electronic one with plastic tipped darts. Just give me something. 

Now that we have found a place to play, the drinks kept us here. A pint of beer is reasonable at $6. The mix drinks are better at $5. So a tab for four with food does not break the wallet. 

If Cinnamon is working the bar area, you are in for a fun night. Her style of humor is awesome."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a 5 star but i had to wait almsot 10 mins to get helped. So with that being said Chris was out waiter. He was very helpful with deciding what to eat and he was very friendly. When the food arrived it was so delicious. I enjoyed every bite of my bacon cheeseburger. Most def will be coming back soon."}
