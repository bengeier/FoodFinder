{"text":"I've had my share of Broasting experience.  No worries Bro, that doesn't mean I'm going to roast y'all.  I haven't reach that level of palette sophistication yet.  Broasting is deep-frying under pressure which cooks the item evenly under less time.  Broaster Chicken establishment is a small take-out joint with the authentic southern scarborough feel.  3 tables 6 chairs available if you're too hungry to take it home.  2 Indian ladies took my order.  Did they not see the busy KFC right next door before they decide to lease?  This one of their 2 locations does have various Indian meals as well which I doubt any KFC will offer.  Tandoori Chicken, Burgers, Chapli Kebab, Butter Chicken, Goat Curry, Chicken Biryani, Shawarma etc...  With plenty of other Indian/Middle Eastern restaurants around, this probably won't be the go-to for those items.  3 pc Fried Chicken + Fries + Drink($6.99)  Colonel's secret is still safe as far as my tastebuds can tell me.  My order was broasted to order but the spicy selection was quite weak while the Chicken meat lacked marination.  Even Popeyes secret will be safe at this point.  The advantage which some might like better is that they cook to order meaning the Chicken they hand you will be Crispy + Juicy everytime which cannot always be said at the other franchises.  Oil used was fresh giving the Chicken a golden outerlayer, less greasy.  Didn't taste overly salty either which is a plus.  For my preference, I need flavour as much as the texture so coming back and waiting for 10min to get Fried Chicken + mushy Wedges will be less than a maybe although more consideration can be had upon their Tues/Wed special(2 pc + Wedges = $2.65).  Btw, they gave me 2 Thigh + 1 Leg by default."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty awesome chicken. It's not smothered in grease like KFC, yet it's still perfectly moist. When I put it in the toaster oven, barely any grease comes out so that's how I know I'm getting better quality chicken. My only recommendation is to have a tad less breading."}
{"text":"This place really dispointed me. I went to eat some good halal food, 1st time at their new fast food restaurant at alton towers scarborough. Got cold food and not even cooked fully, and it wasnt like they was busy even then its unacceptable. I wouldnt recomend any1 to eat there or if u do, dont pay for it if its not done well.  Im big on my food and how i want it. So this place at altontowers really upset me.  I felt as if they where treating the non-muslims more sooner and better service  than me and other muslims.  I wasted, yes waste my time waiting an hr maybe more and others came in and got there food right away poor poor service and quality. Out of ten they get a 1.  I now doubt that they might not even be Halal."}
