{"text":"Where do I start, with the fact that this Mexican restaurant is owned by non mexicans or that the flavorless food is probably what they know as Mexican I don't know but I and everybody in my family were disapointed to say the least I ordered steak fajitas which is a Tex Mex dish FYI and it was horrible this are supposed to be grilled but not here they were boiled and this is a big no. The burrito my friend ordered was awful also so was the service with a waitress that try to speak Spanish to us with no luck at all which was weird because she had a Portuguese accent and both languages are alike anyways my advice go to Don Tequilas us just a couple blocks down."}
{"text":"THIS RESTAURANT IS CLOSED!  A darn shame too cause it was fabulous.  There are some other locations around Cleveland."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food.  For the life of me I have no idea why the place was empty at 9PM on a Friday night.  I suspect the folks in Mentor would rather eat at TGIFrumpy's or Shenanigan's style chain dreck than enjoy some decent ethnic fare.  Service was great and the prices were reasonable too.  C'mon Mentor enjoy a good thing while you can."}
