{"text":"Best hoagies in Pittsburgh hands down. Try the steak or italian, also fried chicken is great. Can't go wrong with Maisie's Pizza."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time tonight. Finally some decent pizza in the NH! I great surprise!"}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite pizza!! They make THE BEST buffalo chicken pizza!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian Hoagies anywhere!! Delivery is fast. Prices are great. We got tired of Adrian's and Vocelli's and one slice of meat on their hoagies. Haven't had their pizza, but the hoagies are great!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location - a modest strip mall in suburbia - fool you. This is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Seriously. The sauce and crust cannot be beat. I stumbled upon the place because of an Entertainment Book coupon, and it has been my go to pizza place since. My dad is very picky, and this is his favorite pizza too. So much so that he asks for me to bring it home when I visit (3 hours away). It's a carry out only little shop, so don't expect a table service. You won't need it. It smells so good, you'll have a slice before you get home."}
{"text":"I got pickup from here this past Saturday evening.  Whenever I called I was told that my 2 large pizzas would be ready in 15 minutes.  20 minutes later they were waiting for me whenever I arrived.  The shop itself is a small place with very little customer space.  Seeing how they do not have a dining area, this is not a problem.

The pizza tasted decently with nothing really standing out besides the large amount of cheese on the pizza which I enjoyed.  So overall I was satisfied with it.

The bottom line for me is that I would come back here again.  The pizza was decent and there was nothing bad to say about it."}
{"text":"Amazing hoagies. Their Pepperoni rolls are more like calzones, which is a happy surprise. The cheddar poppers on their menu are like Jalapeno poppers without the firey lava greens inside, and were a hit with my elementary schooler. 

It's a small little mom and pop type place and that may be a little off putting for dine-in, but man the takeout is worth it!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I love Maisie's! We work in the area and regularly order from here! The delivery is quick and they are always very nice! We love their hoagies (Italian) and the pepperoni rolls are amazing! Support local small businesses like this one! Great food, great prices!"}
