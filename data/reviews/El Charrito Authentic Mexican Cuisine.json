{"text":"Sure El Charrito may not look glamorous on the outside but it's defiantly a great find. They have great prices on their combo plates (see below). Try their Chicken Mole plate served with rice and beans or the Albondigas. I'm not crazy about their  parking area; too many shops in that plaza for such little parking. Not small enough to keep me from eating there.  My Hubby and kids are also fans!!   Daily Specials $3.99 Chile Relleno w/ Beans Beef Tostada w/ Rice and Beans Red or Green Chile Burrito w/ Beans Cheese Enchilada w/ Rice and Beans Beef Taco w/ Rice and Beans"}
{"text":"We chose this restuarant after an reviewing an  article identifying this restaurant as one of the top authentic Mexican Restaurants in the Phoenix area. Upon walking in you seat yourself, the waitress was prompt and polite with taking our drink order. We went at about 5pm on a Saturday afternoon and there were only three other tables with patrons.   Upon taking the drink order we let the waitress know we would need a few extra minutes to make a decision. The waitress did not come back for about 20 minutes...mind you it was not busy. She was on her phone at the bar most of that time. We had finished our drinks at the time she took our order. She didn't ask again for refills until the food came out another 15- 20 minutes later. The only time she was friendly was when she first greeted us or took our money for the meal. It seemed as if we were more of an inconvenience for her than anything.  While the food was average, there was nothing special about it, but it wasn't bad. The service was awful. I would not recommend this restaurant and would offer as a suggestion to try another location such as Popo's or Tia Rosa's in the east valley. There experience is considerably better than here."}
{"text":"Let me tell you the food is very good but unfortunately if you're a white woman with a Mexican American husband you will be looked down upon. Now I have been there previously and never had this type of treatment but today there was a difference in the way we were treated. First we sat ourselves after waiting at the door for 5 mins there was no wait to be seated sign. So we assumed we were to seat ourselves we were given chips by some lady then we sat and waited as the staff did anything but come to our table they rolled silverware and talked about us as we sat and waited for 15 mins. Finally after deciding who was going to wait on us they came and got our order and I'm hoping it's as good as it usually is. I have been gone for a month in a business venture and wanted to have that as my first meal home I am hoping it won't have to be the last time"}
{"text":"Chimichanga had no meat. The service was very slow no refills on soda. Had to call the waitress twice. no manager on duty they usually have good service and good food don't know what happened today. Not the same waitress"}
{"text":"Nice little Mexican food spot, friendly staff and clean inside. The place is bigger then it looks from the outside. I eat here at least once a week and it's always good food. I get the menudo soup once a week and it's like homemade soup to me. Try it next time ur in the area"}
{"text":"This is my families FAVORITE place! We live in Gilbert, but still drive out here all the time because we love the food, and the servers. Our family of 7 can get out for under $25 if we don't get drinks and order everything ala carte. The price isn't what keeps us coming back though, it's the terrific food (and chips and salsa, i'm very picky, and it's perfect!)"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, agreed on by party of three, but not so great service, even with only four booths occupied on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Three stars means three stars. Five star if you live in a retirement center or eastern Wisconsin. This food was bland and mild. Food was served too quickly and not heated through. I sensed it was heated by microwave but it was fresh and the place is clean. So disappointed."}
{"text":"The mission: good Mexican food in Glendale. Should be like shooting fish in a barrel, right? You'd be surprised how much mediocre and downright bad Mexican food there is on the West Side.  Not only that, but I like a place with table service and booze, and if my server speaks English, or at least as much of it as I speak Spanish - that's a bonus. We'll meet halfway.  I was a little anxious about trying El Charrito. I had only found reviews on less-trustworthy sites than Yelp, and they have a website -- a pretty nice one at that. Seems like places with great downhome cooking don't have websites, and if they do, they're crappy.  However, El Charrito surprised me. I have been to Caramba, across the street, many times, and never noticed El Charrito. It's between a tattoo shop and something unremarkable.  Inside, it's brightly painted, yet cozy, due to the low ceilings and dim lighting. Seating is mostly booths, which I dig. There is also a bar. The two big TVs were showing wrestling and Good Evening Arizona.  Our friend was already at the table, so we joined her and immediately plowed into the chips. OMG. They were so light and crisp. Not as warm as I would like. But so light. The salsa, well... it was the traditional style, and just salty, not very spicy or otherwise flavorful.  The menu features all your traditional favorites, plus some more upscale options such as mojo garlic shrimp and chicken mole. I also noted some specials that looked promising, like a grilled fish with spinach.  When it came time to order, we had some communication issues with our server. But we got through it, thanks to the universal language of food and lots of hand signs. I ordered a Negra Modelo and the pollo asado.   It looked really good, and the portions were generous. It came with a huge salad (nothing fancy, just your usual iceberg, tomatoes, etc.), a pool of refried bean, and fries. I was so down with having fries instead of rice.   The chicken was salty and yummy, but the white meat was a bit dry. The beans were kind of thin and pale. But I don't care too much for refried beans anyway. All in all, it was pretty good.  My dining companions demolished their chimis, so I assume they were good. I'm thinking next time I'll order a special, or maybe one of the more popular dishes.  I would call this adventure a success! I would certainly go back to El Charrito. Oh and you can hit up their website for a 15% off coupon!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh nooo. It's alright if you like green chili burritos with no chili. Not for me."}
{"text":"Great hospitality and the Menudo was the bomb we will definitely come back soon. They also serve chips and salsa for free"}
{"text":"I only gave it five stars so everyone can read this review..Food is excellent but the customer service lacks in every way possible, waitress greet you like you stole their favorite crayon and getting the check is impossible ! GOOD.LUCK!!!"}
{"text":"Best beans I've ever has prices are amazing and very affordable and the service is always good oh and the chips and salsa is addictive"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here honestly every time I go your suppose to seat yourself the sign you can barely see then you end up sitting down waiting for a waitress this time I walked out Bc I was waiting 15 min and no one still bothered to greet me and my kids !! They were hungry so we just took our business across the street to carambas !! If your not a regular they treat you crappy !! They don't give you a good amount either for what your paying !! If you have the option to go somewhere else do it !! Sad that this business is like this !! GREET YOUR CUSTOMERS !!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me about this place.  I stopped in for lunch and inside it was much larger than it looked from the front.  Sort of dark I thought but maybe because the bar is a prominent part of the interior.  Service is so so.  Not many customers for a weekday lunch.  I had a couple of chicken enchiladas with rice and beans.  Made with corn tortillas, they were fine.  I thought both the rice and beans were better than Pedro's.  I thought the price was reasonable.  So this now makes 3 Mexican restaurants I want to keep in the regular lunch rotation that are close."}
{"text":"Yes very good service and food is really really god! Love this place. Menudo is good too! The service waitresses are here for a long time and yes even though we are not regulars, we have been coming for the last 10 years. Food is good!"}
{"text":"One of my local favorites for sure.....good mariscos, all round Mexican food and the best red menudo I've had in years. Yes you will wait, even when its empty but its always been worth it....good fair prices as well!"}
{"text":"SINGING COOKS ALWAYS MEANS SAVOR! SERVICE STAFF TREATS YOU LIKE EXTENDED FAMILY JOINING FOR A GREAT FAMILY MEAL. DECOR A BIT DRAB, BUT THIS PLACE HAS POTENTIAL!!!  --made-to-order Pico de Gallo is fresh and spicy, but too salty, especially if you eat with corn chips. --when you can hear cooks singing in the kitchen, you KNOW it's going to be good. --flour tortillas, though delivered, had only SIX ingredients. --guacamole should _never_ have a thickener like milk --rice too small, so it dried out fast, too bad. --cheese crisp not crispy, green chili strips were fresh!  DECOR NEEDS A REDRESS --long strands of hanging beer flags don't make a place festive unless they're flapping in the wind at a Mexico beach bar --nor do mounted mariachi hats and diagonally-stapled multicolor throw rugs --caballeros and damas are great, but don't mount McDonald's-plain Men and Women signs underneath. --mirrored walls are '80s. EW.  must qualify my review by mentioning my corn allergy. means I can't eat much from this menu. great local feel here, needs a facelift."}
{"text":"Well first the service is not great... Mostly because it appears to only have 1 main waitress and the other girl seems to clean tables and serve chips. But the waitress is friendly, it is bigger inside than what it appears outside... A little on the dark side. Restroom needs upgrading but it was clean which is always a plus. The food is good, I love the rice and beans the food was hot when it arrived... Red chili was flavorful. I'd go back if I was in the area not to sure if I'd go out of my way for it but I would go back."}
{"text":"The food here is usually very good. But the service and attention to detail, makes it horrible. Was very disappointed last couple of visits here. I will no longer be dinning in."}
{"text":"This restaurant may not look like the best. There are many fancier looking restaurants, but this restaurant makes up for it with their food. Their menudo is amazing! There food taste like authentic Mexican food. The only downfall of this restaurant is the waitresses. They forget to check up on you sometimes. On the weekends, they get so busy there's a line to get in. The food is amazing so it's worth the wait and servers."}
