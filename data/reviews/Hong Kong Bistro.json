{"text":"Soup was good but if your watching your sodium I wouldn't recommend it... we got orange chicken,  sesame chicken and generals chicken.. all breaded and they only added the different sauces to differentiate them.  My husband took the bread off and there was maybe 3oz of chicken for the entire order.  The chicken without the bread tasted like McDonald's chicken nuggets.   There was enough bread on his plate to make three large pancakes or more.   The flavor was good but definitely not authentic chinese and definitely not worth the price.  No veggies not even in the fried rice.  Really dissapointing. Wasted $40+ on crap food.   If McDonald's served chinese food this is what it would be."}
{"text":"We tried a few chinese restaurants before we found this one.  Once found a smile of relief spread across our face.  They have consistently good food.  They are always friendly and have good customer service."}
{"text":"I should have checked the closing time before I went there with the family. But I was there 30 minutes before closing. Still I was told that almost closing time but I can order to-go. So I did. Person who took order rushed me to complete the order !!!! Not a beef-eater chose chicken and shrimp in the main course. Guess what I found. Beef !!!

Not sure if I'd want to visit again."}
{"text":"I used too eat here monthly, but the last two times here are keeping me away.  My daughter was served Orange beef, but it was cold AND there was a long hair in it.  I asked for a pair of chop sticks and the server said \"ok\" but never brought them.  Last time, we had large chunks of who knows what in our hot and sour soup...maybe flavoring chunks that didn't dissolve? Who knows.  I'm looking for my next new fave Chinese place. Too bad too because it was inexpensive."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted about the last experience we had at this restaurant. We have been several times before with no problems. The owner was there each of the previous times and was also our server. She is always amazing. BUT, on our last visit, an older woman and a young boy were the servers. When we walked in, the young boy told us to sit anywhere. As there was a large family with small children near where we wanted to sit, we chose a booth farthest away from them that happened to not have the paper Chinese zodiac placemats on it. We were already comfortable in our booth when the older woman came over and asked us in a rude tone if we could move to another booth that already had the placemats on it that was right next to the large family with small children. I really didn't know how hard it would have been to just bring over some placemats to the booth we had chosen (after being told by the young boy to sit anywhere). She was so rude about it, by instincts were to leave right then and there, but sadly we stayed. The rest of our time there was ruined by more rude, slow service from the older woman, and a young boy really shouldn't be utilized as a server. When he brought our food over, I asked if our combo meals were supposed to come with fried rice. He reacted by saying in a loud voice, \"I'm bringing it!\" The large family next to us ended up having perfectly behaved children, but you could tell the husband was also becoming frustrated by the lack of good service. At one point he had to get up to get to-go boxes because his family had clearly been done eating for quite some time by then. The older lady practically threw him 4 boxes without even a bag to put all of them in. The reason I am conflicted is the food was actually quite good, as it has always been. I did notice during our meal that they were doing a good deal of takeout business. There were much more people doing takeout than eating in the restaurant. When we stood up to leave, we noticed about 6 inches away from my wife's foot (she was wearing sandals) there was a huge number of ants attempting to take apart a piece of food that had fallen on the floor. Thank goodness they had something to occupy themselves with, or they might have attacked my wife's foot. We took it as a sign to never eat inside the restaurant again, if we return, it will be for takeout. It is such a shame how much of an impact a bad server can have on your dining experience."}
{"text":"We tried this place tonight for the first time. We weren't expecting fine dining. I will say we both thought the won ton soup was too salty. The crab puffs were good but the egg rolls a bit small and not that tasty. My sweet and sour chicken was ok but the chicken was overwhelmed by the bread coating. My husband's sesame chicken was better. The portions were generous so having leftovers increases the $ value of the food. I easily have enough for lunch tmw. Service was prompt and pleasant and all in all an adequate meal. Inexpensive too. I can see us going back again."}
{"text":"Good for a local restaurant.   Tried the bell pepper beef and twice cooked chicken.  The beef was good but I wouldn't recommend it twice cooked chicken.  We wanted the lobster and steak but they didn't have any lobster,  so they substituted scallops.  Fried rice was excellent and the portions were large."}
{"text":"Fried rice was worst i ever eat...im grow up asia and i go out eat some other place around here but this is worst place.
And service people are not so good little rude.
Im so disappointed. . . ."}
{"text":"We've been going here off and on for a couple years now.
This is a family restaurant, not a chain.
The food is very good; we've never been disappointed.  Egg drop soup is very flavorful and rich.  The entrees are very generous--always more than we can eat so we have take-home along with dine-in!
The atmosphere is fairly quiet, though rarely empty.
I told them I liked food with a \"hot\" flavor.  They accommodated me!   whooof!!!"}
{"text":"Honest to goodness the best chinese food I've ever had was at a tiny family owned restaurant on the island of Santorini in Greece, maybe it had something to do with being so over Greek food by the second week of my trip but ever since then I've been on a seach for a non-chain restaurant in the states that compares.  My husband and I just moved to Chandler a couple of months ago and found Hong Kong Bistro as we were driving to the supermarket one day. We decided to check it out. The small restaurant was cute, the staff was very helpful and polite, our waitress asked if it was our first time, made suggestions and asked for our names to remember for the next time.  I ordered the Garlic Chicken, just as good as any I've had at any other chinese restaurant, the egg drop soup was also good, it had corn it which was a little weird but still good. My husband ordered the Gang Pang chicken which was spicy and very good.  They have a combo special where you add $1 to your meal and get a crab puff, egg roll, soup and fried rice added to your already very well priced main dish. They also have a small bar which looked fully loaded to me.  All in all it was as good as any other chinese restaurant I've been to, not the best, but for the price and location I was pleased and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We drive from east Gilbert all the way to south Chandler for the food here. They have great combinations & we've never been disappointed. The staff is very friendly and the menu is diverse. It's a great place! We recommend the orange chicken and the lemon chicken."}
{"text":"Great Chinese place - awesome food and super affordable. The vegetable egg foo young is mouth watering and you can't go wrong with egg drop soup. Sauces are tasty as well. Favorite nearby take out spot! I've been going here for years and years."}
{"text":"Food is priced well, and most of staff is very friendly.  Used to come here a lot back in the day, but food has gone from a 5 start to 4 star.  Still good for the price.  much better than other options for chinese food in the area"}
{"text":"Best Asian food in town! This is my family's number 1 \"go-to\" spot in Chandler. Great service, great food, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We frequently order from this place.  Excellent portions for the price and great quality food!"}
{"text":"This is a clean, friendly, solidly consistent Chinese food joint. I've had bad Chinese food before, and I am happy to say this isn't it. We're lucky to have this close to the house. Recommended."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have had since moving here a year ago from Washington state. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is very inconsistent with regards to food (taste, portions, temperature) and service (friendliness, speed of service).  Sometimes they've shown flashes of brilliance and sometimes we leave wondering why we go.  Unfortunately there are only two other places near that are worse than HK Bistro."}
{"text":"Their egg drop soup is excellent  with a corn chowder kind of flavor. Their egg rolls are pathetic, like tiny La Choy frozen appetizers that came out of a microwave. Everything else is mediocre. I don't think the mother and son who run this place have ever been to a Chinese restaurant in America! They don't serve crispy fried noodles with soup or bring it to your table with mustard and duck sauce. And they don't have packets of chinese mustard or duck sauce. They have to make it for you upon request and it's a very time-consuming big deal. They are also not careful about packaging to go orders and brown liquid usually soaks the bag and/or boxby the time you get to the car. Bottom line: well meaning but pitifully amateurish."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going here as I went on recommendation.  I will say, the food was very good, tasted fresh and was very tasty. 

However, sometimes the experience can spoil the meal.  There is no host to seat you so when you walk in you are just guessing as to if to seat yourself, wait for someone etc.  At this point a child (yes, I mean about a 9 year old child) tells us where to sit. 

After a bit; a Chinese woman asks for our drink order.  Upon returning she takes our order although she does talk me out of the sizzling rice soup because she thinks its too big if I plan to order dinner.  She tells me that she will just put rice on top of wonton soup (which arrives too cooled to sizzle the rice). 

Dinner is served with 1 paper napkin each.  Although we had ordered the \"extra sides\" as stated on the menu for $1.50 each; when those were delivered to the table, they were on 1 plate set in front of my hubby.  NO indication that it was for both of us. 

Food itself was actually quite good.  1/2 way through dinner I received a phone call on my cell that was a bit important.  When I grabbed my phone, I accidently dropped it in my sizzling seafood platter.  This splashed my phone, hair and shirt with sauce.  The primary waitress SAW this happened, yet it took 10 minutes to get additional napkins.  I requested water and we never received. 

The 9 year old is who processed my credit card for the bill.  We never were served water, asked to order additional drinks etc. 

Bottom line; IF I go here again, it will be for take out order only.  Food good, service bad."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Get the Pot stickers and the chicken and broccoli dish! Probably close to my favorite Chinese food place next to my house! (: I recommend trying them!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a neighborhood Chinese rest since we got to AZ and I think we finally found it. Food was hot, fresh and tasty. The menu was uninspired but comfortable with the usual selections. Add a combo to any meal for $1 and get soup,egg roll, crab rangoon, and fried rice"}
{"text":"This place is situated in a strip mall that surrounds Bashas'.  Is this Chandler or what?  I thought it was Queen Creek.

Having been looking for someplace new to have lunch, I remembered seeing this place in passing and thinking, \"Bistro..?\".

Well, yes, it's not a bistro.  It is, in fact, a standard Chinese restaurant.  But one thing seems to be pretty certain with these types of places,....lunch specials.  It's really hard to go wrong with a lunch special.

Considering the proximity of Hong Kong Bistro to my place of work (BFE) along with the relative affordability and efficiency I experienced, I'm giving this place a big fat four star rating.  It was mad decent, as the kids say (or said maybe three years ago).  

It was also mad empty with only two or three other groups of patrons.

I like my Chinese hostesses/cashiers to be a little more adamant and curt.  I like it when they direct me to where I'm going to sit without any second thought or consideration to where I'd like to be placed.  I expect them to immediately take my order and then sigh or roll their eyes when I ask for a brief moment to look over the menu.  

Unfortunately, this wasn't the case here.  The hostess was extremely pleasant.

She asked me if I was ready to order and I told her that I was but then said \"Well, I have a couple questions.\"  I didn't really have questions but just wanted to see what she would do.

\"All of our entrees are made with white meat,\" was the answer I received when I asked about a particular chicken dish.

In the end, I ordered Gang Pang Chicken because it sounded funny almost like Gang Bang Chicken but really, it was surprisingly good.  It's like General Tso Chicken minus the broccoli plus jalapenos.  Pretty freaking rad.

I never order drinks outside of hot tea and water because yes, I'm a cheap bastard.  The waitress kept both filled to the brim.  Awesome.

When all was said and done, I paid $6.50 and dropped a two dollar tip because I felt it was worthy. 

I'll probably come back sometime."}
{"text":"I think they've been thru an owner change in the last year. Currently, the food is excellent. It is fresh tasting Chinese food, versus the oil-laden stuff you get at most cheap Chinese places. I'm guessing that they put the Chinese vendor in the nearby Basha's out of businees. We like all their offerings and have not been disappointed. 

One nice story - we were eating in their restaurant one night and got some strange tasting lemon chicken - seemed like old chicken. I believe it was the owner who came out to field our complaint - tasted the chicken, made a sour face, simplhy said \"No, that is bad.\", grabbed the entree, and went back to the kitchen. Within a couple minutes, we had a fresh batch which tasted perfect. She credited us for the chicken and another entree. Needless to say, we're regular customers."}
{"text":"Only knock on this place is its hard to find their menu online! The food is really good especially the orange beef. The lady running the place is nice. Reasonable prices. Overall good experience in multiple times there."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service was adequate.  It felt like you walked into someone's home instead of a restaurant. The \"children\" offered you something to drink and the menu. Then \"Mom\" (dressed in a hoodie and jeans) did everything else while multitasking doing business on the phone.  After we received our food, \"Dad\" walked in drinking a Starbucks and able to help out by answering the phone since \"Mom\" was dishing out food for some other \"guests\".  Not quite a \"dinner party\", nor a restaurant but I won't hold it against them. The food was good enough that I'll be back to try some more."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in chandler, potstickers are amazing!  Came in on a Saturday even though yelp says it's closed, glad I did.  We had the fried rice which honestly is better than most places around here.  The happy family and seafood here was delicious.

Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Everything is always super fresh.  The sizzling rice soup is a fave.  Also really enjoy the egg foo young.  One of the best in town"}
{"text":"Wish I had found this place sooner!!  Great food and great service!! Family owned!! Plus, they remember their customers and treat them right!! Thank you, Hong Kong Bistro!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The food was delicious. The service after we received our dinner was lacking and on multiple occassions we had to wave to get a server's attention (for napkins and extra sauce). We waited for our check and take out box. Had the service been up to par, it'd be a five star review. We will likely be back, especially since the food was good."}
{"text":"Me and my wife come here for the food. The service is lack luster but majority of the time we get takeout anyway. About 90 ? of the time it's usually take out.

The service at the place is so and so. I think a lot of it has to do with something lost in translation or how to say something the \"right way\". Instead of asking \"are you ready to order\" they'll say \"are you ready to order yet\", which sounds rude but isn't intended to be. But my review is  mainly on the food and the food is awesome. 

General Tso and the low mein beef or chicken is my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to happen by this place. When I saw the word \"Bistro\" in the name I hoped for great food, but worried it would come at a price.

I am delighted at my total bill of $5.41 for a pot of tea, a cup of wonton soup and two egg rolls. I am very picky about the texture and content of egg rolls. I was amazed that the quality and portions of each item was EXCELLENT! 

I will be back. Very happy!"}
{"text":"Their Hot & Sour Soup is delicious and perfect for those \"I'm sick and gotta have soup nights!\" Egg rolls and crab puffs are to par, but the puffs come in bulk (10 quantity), so don't buy unless you have a few people to share with. 

Their lunch specials are good values, but their dinner pricing seems to be overpriced.

Parking is typically cramped, thanks to the music business next door."}
{"text":"This is our standard pick for Chinese. Great noodles and  Mongolian beef. We've order just about most items and all are tasty. Family is really nice. Service is good."}
{"text":"Great Mongolian Beef. One of the better Asian restaurants around. Crab puffs also very good. Hard to find good Chinese food, this is one of the better places."}
{"text":"Boo.  Hiss.  

Okay, despite the name 'bistro' attached, Hong Kong Bistro is only a half-step up from fast-food Chinese.  I grew up back east with the best Chinese place just down the street from me, so I have to try all these close places in the hopes of finding a gem.  Keep looking.  

The food isn't ALL that bad, maybe a two-star. I've had worse at Panda Express and other MSG-happy dives.  But the service is excruciating. 

They are \"under new management\" and I tolerated them a lot better when they were brand new and under the \"original\" management.  I don't know who these people are who are running this place now, but it's a joke.

I went recently to get takeout.  I'm standing there waiting for this uber-creepy guy to run my credit card, and he's leering at me, and he says, \"Declined\" as the sheet is printing from the card machine.  \"What?\" I ask.  \"Declined,\" he laughs.  Then hands me the slip to sign.  Humor is lost in the translation.

Then today was a nightmare.  35 minutes for one lunch special and some crab puffs.  This skinny, pimply woman with absolutely no handle on the English language was running around screeching \"I new!  I new!\" and not helping anyone.  The phone was ringing, customers were coming to the counter to ask for refills...  A little boy waiting when I was exclaimed to his father, \"I don't understand anything she's saying.\"  Yeah, neither did anyone else.  

When she was done screaming into the phone repetitively (I guess the guy on the other end couldn't understand her either) and I finally had my order taken, it was like pulling teeth.  She actually got on the PHONE and handed it to me, \"Here.  Manager,\" and HE took my order.  ARE YOU SERIOUS??  Where the hell is he that he can't schlep his ass into the restaurant to save this poor wretch?

When I got my food after 35 minutes, it was cold and awful.  The beef lo main was at least edible, the crab puffs were icy and the fried rice, was ugh, just awful. 

And now, to quote Marge from \"Fargo\", \"Just feel like I'm gonna barf.\""}
{"text":"Worst carry out service ever!  They always say \"10 to 15 minutes\" and take 45!  Today they wrote the wrong phone number down and called out the incorrect number for 15 minutes while my wife was sitting there waiting for our food.  How about using names or calling out what was ordered?  I think we are done with them. Too bad because I liked their food."}
{"text":"Good food, nice staff, love the sweet and sour pork, they also make their own hot mustard which is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I'm usually very skeptical when it comes to Chinese food. So finally after 5 years of living in the area I have found the place. Its not upscale and not a \"bistro\" just a regular restaurant in a strip mall. But this place has fast service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Love this place! We have been looking for a good Chinese place and we now found it.  Love the food and the family that owns it is so nice and I love that the kids of the owner work there as well.  It's a great family business.  Definitely will continue to eat here and recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"This is our favorite family place to go for dinner.  We love the food and the staff is so nice and friendly, we feel like we are at home.

We have yet to have a bad meal hear and we have tried many dishes.  The portions are huge and everything is cooked to order quickly and it is so yummy.  

Don't be alarmed if the restaurant looks empty, they do a ton of take out.  If you are in South Chandler and like Chinese food, you must dine here."}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment twice. First time service was horrible and I figured it was just an off day and I typically give restaurants many chances. Took my family today and I am now convinced to never step foot in here again. My family of 5 was seated and we witnessed 2 other families walk in about 10 mins after us and placed order. It seemed one of the family knew the worker because they were pretty excited to see each other. About 15 mins passed and the other two parties received their food. The worker refilled their drinks multiple times and not once had she offered to fill ours. As I said before I am one to normally give restaurants multiple chances hoping it was just an off day but the service sucks. Food is okay. They have good meals except their fried rice is always pretty dry."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last night - food was super fresh & very light. Delicious. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Couldnt find this little place listed anywhere and we have struggled finding a good place to eat our favorite Chinese in Chandler. HK Bistro is excellent and fast.. The spicy dishes have some kick and they are prompt.. Every time we call in they are BUSY (that's always a great sign).. Give them a try you will love the food. The OWNER actually suggested the GANG PANG Chicken and KUNG PAO Veggies.. They were AWESOME... Give this place a shot..."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Chinese food. The owners are very friendly and welcoming. The decor is very nice. Overall a pleasant experience. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Most delicious hot and sour soup! Only improvement i would suggest is hiring more staff to reduce wait times."}
{"text":"Not only are the people who work here incredibly kind, the food is delicious!  I always get the hot tea when I sit and eat there.  Take out is efficient and they're super accurate with their time estimates over the phone."}
{"text":"Not consistent since the place was sold. I would drive a few miles and go to Yao's. A much better place."}
{"text":"It was Ok, been trying for years to find a good Chinese restaurant. I had pork fried rice and my wife vegetable egg foo young. I'll keep looking"}
{"text":"We order takeout about once a month and it's always good. We order by phone and 15 minutes later we pick it up. The owners are great local people that emigrated from China. We've eaten in the restaurant a few times and it has been a good experience. Service is always friendly and prompt. It's not a chain restaurant so don't expect that kind of atmosphere. If you get to know the owners and their family you will like it that much more and become a regular."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, service, and the decor is awesome. This is the nicest chinese place I've been to in  Arizona. Spared no expense with a nice dining area. Tea could have been better, funky taste to it."}
{"text":"we live close by and eat here often....the food is consistently good and service is also....would like it if they had barbecue pork, but haven't seen that on the menu.  I like the beef with vegetables or almond chicken."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food.  Big selection of food.  Clean family restaurant. Looks like it's popular for take out! Definitely will come again!"}
{"text":"I asked if they could do lunch special even tho it was 20 minutes past the cutoff lady said \"no\" and hung up on me ! I called back she said \"yes what do u need ? \" food is okay and owner is usually nice but she's responsible for her employees and this woman was AWFUL , we will not be back"}
{"text":"The problem with reviews is that when someone who works at the place reads them and doesn't approve, they send a nasty message and then block what you say.  Still say Hong Kong Bistro is not good. Of course, some people do not know good food."}
{"text":"Called several times and it went to voice mail saying mailbox was was full. Decided to drive over since the reviews were good.

We got there and they were rather busy. So, told them we wanted to order a to go order. We sat down and they took our order.

While sitting there, we noticed that the service was not good. A couple was seated and got the appetizer. The man asked for hot mustard. Waitress said no problem. Waiter came over, he was asked for it as well, no problem.

Waitress comes by 5 minutes later and patron asks for hot mustard again. She says no problem, buses a table and then finally brings the mustard.

We got our food and went home. We then noticed that our combos didn't have the egg rolls or crab puffs. Called them and they fixed it right away but I had to drive back to get the missing food.

Now to the food. None of it was memorable. General Tso's chicken tasted like sweet and sour chicken without the sour. The beef and broccoli as well as the beef lo mein were tasteless.

The pot stickers were dry.

So.... we won't be back and we recommend that you don't go either."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. I'm from the east coast and have been in AZ for 10 years and cannot find authentic Chinese food here except for just a couple places that are too far to drive regularly.  For some reason Chinese restauranteurs think they should reduce the flavor for AZ palettes. Hong Kong food was no exception and was the blandest of them all.  The food was cooked well and the vegetables were fine. If Chinese owners would cook the food authentically, there would be many more people flocking. The authentic flavor of any cultural dish is what a customer wants. Imagine bland Italian food, Mexican food, Peruvian, el Salvadoran, Morrocan, it names no sense. Step up your game, owners! I won't be going back to Hong Kong."}
{"text":"Egg Foo young just like I remember from Golden Canyon in Mesa! It's not the original yellow sauce, but those delicious egg patties cannot be beat! And trust me, I've tried at least a dozen Chinese restaurants in the chandler-gilber area.  Pork fried rice is awesome.  I'm so happy, I could cry!  Once Golden Canyon closed I thought I was screwed, but lo and behold, this place has been around for a while thank goodness!"}
{"text":"Win win with this place!!!! We are new to Az & were recommended this places from friends & are soooooo glad we went. Such good food, large portions & reasonable prices. We will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"Good option for take out Chinese. Or even eating in - we had nice service there. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The last two visits were just not good.  About six weeks ago, we went with another couple and the service was downright horrible.  We had to repeatedly ask for things like hot mustard and the server was rude and abrupt.

Last night we attempted to go again.  It was very warm as soon as we walked in.  The same server as the last time greeted us.  I asked if the air conditioning was on and she walked away without answering.  She returned a couple minutes later, presumably to take our beverage order.  Again I asked if she could turn down the thermostat.  She responded rudely saying, \"You do it.\"  Not feeling comfortable taking that upon myself. I asked for the manager.  Raymond came over and said he didn't have authority to do that and would have to ask his uncle.   At that point, we said we were leaving.  We were not sitting in a restaurant that was 82+ degrees and smelly....we love their food, but this group of servers had no idea about customer service."}
{"text":"I have never tried this place because I live in Scottsdale so it's a journey if I tried to go...but I use to go to Golden Canyon which is their sister Restaurant that is located in Mesa off of Dobson and Southern Rd. This location was ideal it wasn't  too far for me but they closed it permanently...but if the food at Hong Kong Bistro is like anything like the food at Golden Canyon I am going to have to travel far for some good Chinese food...the service at the Mesa location was okay probably the same at their current location but I usually had the take out so it didn't matter to me but the food...and it was amazing I hear the food menu is exactly the same..."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this place for years.  They are very polite and get the orders right the first time.  It isn't a trendy \"meat market\" but it's a nice family place to sit down and have some good Chinese food."}
{"text":"We love having this place close. They have great take out but their food is even better when you eat there. Friendly staff and their food is always steaming hot. 
We've had almost every started and soup. All very yummy. We haven't had a main dish we haven't like."}
{"text":"2.55 Stars

Hong Kong Bistro is one of those restaurants that is nearby and I thought I had already reviewed it.

They are a pretty basic Chinese restaurant with decor one step above the typical hole in the wall joint.

Expect average quality and prices, no more, no less.

The people here are friendly.  I have nothing else to say about Hong Kong Bistro and you may consider that a reflection of my experience here as much as anything else."}
{"text":"How great can my Birthday be? HK Bistro is still the best Chinese Restaurant we discovered in Chandler. Unsurpassed and not expensive. Very friendly and attentive. Mongolian Beef, Beef Lomein and Chicken with Broccoli so tasty. Keep up the good work Michelle."}
{"text":"I really like this small Chinese restaurant. The waitress is ALWAYS pleasant, patient and smiles. I always feel welcome. 
One thing I need is gluten free food, because I have Celiac Disease, and Hong Kong Bistro always makes me GF food with out complaining not giving me the look. And the food is so delicious!!! They prepare it quickly. My husband and I have been a loyal customer for about 7 years."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for about five years, it's great for a quick Asian six. My favorite dish is the general chicken with vegetable lo mein. Sweet and spicy!"}
{"text":"Love love love their service! My husband is especially fond of their shrimp fried rice- which is the largest shrimp I've ever seen in this dish! Usually restaurants use small shrimp or skimp on the quantity of shrimp, but not here"}
{"text":"You'll give this place 5 stars also if you go in with the right expectations. 

Is the food the best Chinese I've ever had? Probably not, but it's definitely better than average. Here's how I put it to a friend: Their food is somewhere between Panda Express and a higher end Chinese joint,  BUT a better value by far then either of those. 

The food is clean, the service is fast and best of all, you won't find many better \"bangs for your buck\". We recently fed a family of 6 for 43 dollars and I was eating leftovers for lunch for three days. Love it! Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! We love their egg drop soup and General Tso's chicken! They are really nice in there and the food is always hot!"}
{"text":"If you like super super sweet orange and general so's chicken without any vegetables and a ton of breading then this is the place for you. Honestly even Panda Express is better and that's not saying much. They do have good soup and egg rolls ! I suggest you keep looking if you want good Chinese food."}
{"text":"This is a tough one... I'd say 3.5 stars. The pot stickers and sauce were 4, very good! The rice was kinda bland but good if you like Americanized Chinese rice, the sweet and sour pork was very fresh... I'd say a 4 I supposed but a 2-3 for portion, very small portion imo. The egg flower soup was really yellow... it earned a 2. The hot and sour soup at first appeared like it was going to be a disappointment and was a little bland so I added some salt but upon mixing it, it became spicy and was surprisingly a 3. It wasn't a complete disappointment but it did have a kick that snuck up on you. We didn't eat the weird fried chips or the white rice but what was kinda shocking was that I was charged $36 plus and then she demanded y card again for another $6.89, lol! She wouldn't tell me how much it was over the phone and wouldn't give me an itemized receipt so I gotta say it was kind of pricey considering the portion size but would I come here again? I think so but mostly because it is close and convenient... it was completely empty except for one party on a Sunday evening so I guess that kind of speaks for itself. I would recommend this place if you like Americanized Chinese food for sure! I don't think it's bad at all just not super impressed but it beats having to cook I suppose, lol! I'll bump it up to a4 for being super duper speedy! 10 minutes to get all this food was pretty darn fast! ?"}
{"text":"Good take away.  My big issue with this place is that the breading on their food is far too thick..Also, when was there a convention to make all Kung Pao chicken crappy?

Always order the combo meal...it's cheaper than the packaged meals and you get more food going with the combo."}
