{"text":"OMG this place is sooo amazing. Fresh and delicious and sooo good for you. Worth a stop for sure.   The staff is amazing and delicious, health juices and smoothies."}
{"text":"I tried Bowl of Heaven 2 days ago while visiting my daughter in Madison.  We both ordered a regular limealicious bowl. We felt that the price, size and toppings were very appropriate. We wouldn't change a thing. We ate these as a late lunch on Thursday and found ourselves very satisfied until well after dinner.

Being from the West Coast, acai bowls are not a new concept. However, the bowls at Bowl of Heaven were absolutely on point. Too many places use sherbet or dairy products like yogurt. I really appreciated that they don't use added sugars or anything dairy. Their bowls are vegetarian / vegan which is perfect (just leave the honey off for vegan).

Many times I will have some discomfort or other  reaction due to allergies when frequenting other establishments . It's so nice to have sampled Bowl of Heaven's offering - we felt so amazing afterwards. I would highly recommend this for anyone interested eating healthier.

I know that my daughter will return frequently. ;)  I am jealous that she has such easy access to you. I will just wait and hope that you bring one to Oregon very soon (please, please, please). Hopefully the Hillsboro / Tanasbourne area!"}
{"text":"My second time here and the bowls are good. They have a nice variety of extras you can buy like flower water and organic snacks. One of the main attractions for me is the tree in the front of the store full of honey BEES. That represents GOOD LUCK  to the establishment as well as the patrons
The customer service is great w/ LaMonica and Alexis"}
{"text":"This place is expensive, but the quality is there. I've loved everything I've tried. I always get a ginger shot with apple juice and pick me up I need for my mid day crash. The North Shore Bowl is a repeat on my order list. I also like to get the juices."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service I received at my last visit as well as for the acai. The manager/owner Josh and his team of employees are awesome. They all had positive attitudes and smiled at every customer. Also, I noticed the owner would go out of his way to speak with and greet every person walking in all the while serving up those super tasty (and customizable) acai bowls. This all combined meant I would now pledge my allegiance to bowl of heaven. Additionally, the location is really convenient and very clean inside. I wish I had more hands so I could give this place four thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Terrible Acai Bowl.  This is the worst I have ever had.

I'm embarrassed for the place claiming the \"North Shore Original\".  

The Maq something juice have got to go. 

Zero star for consistency of the product, the flavor, the granola, the ultra small amount of toppings, the quality, and most importantly the whole idea of an acai bowl from Hawaii."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice. They have great blends of juices and not to mention they use natural ingredients. The price is GREAT as well. Hands down best in the valley."}
{"text":"The almond butter bowl is one of the best things I've ever eaten! As someone with food allergies and is conscious about what I put into my body, it's nice to have a place to treat myself to!"}
{"text":"Great acai, however I have been here multiple times and the workers have been consistently rude. They seem annoyed to be there every time and don't have a positive attitude. We went there today and the girls name tag said \"Fireman\" and she had such a poor attitude it ruined the experience. The food is delicious but I think it's worth it to go somewhere else and feel welcome."}
{"text":"I always go to the La Verne, CA location but since being out in Vegas, I was super excited to see a Bowl of Heaven pop up! I have a certain acai bowl order including apples, cinnamon, granola, and honey that I get every time back at home. Unfortunately this location didn't offer that bowl. Usually a business would have told me \"so sorry, but we don't make that bowl etc\" but these people were AMAZING and went above and beyond with great customer service. They not only called other locations for the ingredients necessary but made it perfectly and for free! The people behind this company are amazing and this locations customer service surpassed anything I've witnessed before. 

Bowl of heaven is amazing!!! You won't be disappointed EVER!   
Great taste and a healthier alternative to take out/fast food!"}
{"text":"For fans of Basik Cafe or the Hawaiian acai bowls, this is the place to come. Great selection, plus ability to add extra toppings. My favorite is the North Shore bowl with added cocoa nibs and bee pollen. Perfect for a hot day"}
{"text":"The name is perfectly fitting! Every delicious, decadent bowl & smoothie are pure heaven and almost unbelievable that something this good is good for you too! The interior is fresh, clean & zen like... My fave is the SeaSider!! But everything is totally delish! The service is amazing too... Great way to start or end your day or a midday pick-me-up of deliciousness & kindness"}
{"text":"We love this place! Great for kids and adults alike, with a focus on healthful ingredients."}
{"text":"There's something about when an owner works their own business that really stands out to me, and it's evident in the quality of their product. That's exactly how it is at Bowl of Heaven. The gentleman even noticed me standing outside waiting for them to open one day, and opened early for me so I could make it to class on time! 

One thing great about this above other \"Jamba Juice\" and \"Tropical Smoothie\" places is they don't load sugar into everything and claim it's healthy. You know exactly what's going into every thing you order which is very important to me and other health conscious people. 

I've been to Bowl of Heaven on multiple occasions, it's located directly across from UNLV next to Cafe Rio so it's very convenient for students or anyone who works in the area. 

They offer acai bowls (which seem to be the most popular), fresh juices, and smoothies. 

For Acai Bowls, I've tried: 

North shore Original- Organic Acai, Strawberries, Bananas, Blueberries, Apple Juice & Topped with hemp, sliced banana and honey. DELICIOUS. Refreshing.

Peanut butter bowl- My absolute favorite (I'm a huge peanut butter fan). Essentially the same ingredients I believe but with peanut butter and chocolate almond milk instead of apple juice. This one is richer, but still very refreshing. 

I love the bowls so much, I never planned on venturing out, but the owner kindly invited me back to try the fresh juice on the house for my repeat business. 

For juice, I tried the the Green Glory which has Kale, Spinach, Lemon, Cucumber, Celery, Parsley and Apple. I could drink this everyday. It's not harsh (for the beginning juicers) but they put the perfect amount of Apple to add a slight sweetness. 

One day I was on the go and they said they could make any bowl into a smoothie, so I decided to try the Popeye blast. It had the Organic Acai, strawberries, pineapple, blueberries, apple juice, bananas, fresh kale and spinach. Hands down one of the best smoothies I've ever had. 

You really can't go wrong with anything you try here, so if you're unsure, definitely ask the employees. I have several times and they always steer me in the right direction based on my taste buds and what I'm craving!"}
{"text":"This place is a great healthy alternative to common frozen yogurt placed in town. They use an acai based yogurt essentially which is healthier and not as sweet. Bowl of Heaven offers a variety of toppings and flavored acai (yes, flavored acai!) that keeps you coming back for more. Ive gone twice and both times I loved the flavors and got just what I want, you might think they would all taste the same, but they really do taste unique! 

And the toppings include freshly sliced fruit and hemp seeds, cant beat that!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good but pretty pricey too. It's conveniently located across from UNLV which is probably the only reason I'd go there is craving an acai bowl. The cashier wasn't sure what was even on their menu, considering it was relatively short. Took a while to get my bowl even though it was only a friend and I there at the time. When I finally got it, the acai itself was pretty watered down for my liking."}
{"text":"Quality Acai bowls, great atmosphere, great prices, and friendly staff. The manager Josh was so welcoming.
I am so happy that this place is only 5 mins away from my home :)"}
{"text":"Superb! In the same parking lot as Rebel Books. Accidentally reviewed their mobile location. This stuff is very addicting but extremely healthy (and really fixes a sweet tooth attack). Prices are very reasonable as well. And although I'm not a student, there's a sign that offers discounts if you show school ID. 

Wish we had one on the east coast!!!"}
{"text":"North Shore Bowl. Add Belgian dark chocolate. That's all that needs to be said about this place. 

So I've loved Bowl of Heaven since they opened. I recently started working at Hilldale and was amazed to hear that none of my co-workers had tried it. In fact, they were all too scared that it was too healthy to come with me. I got a large and was glad I did because everyone wanted to try it. In fact, two of them left an hour later to get kid sized bowls for a snack because it was so good. 

Also, their granola is maybe the best I've ever had. 

Definitely join the loyalty club (though employees, please stop rolling your eyes and sighing when I mention I'm a member... You have signs up about it... Just accept it). And also order ahead online/on the app as it can take some time if you don't."}
{"text":"First time here and got the Seasider bowl! Although I normally get the traditional unblended Acai this one was really good. The ingredients were fresh and the service was great."}
{"text":"We ordered Sea sider, sunset and peanut butter ice cream.  Everything was so fresh and my kids really enjoyed each favors!  We will come back again."}
{"text":"A bit of a wait but it is worth it. I got the Sunset Acai Bowl and enjoyed it quite a bit."}
{"text":"PROS:
+ Good location, UNLV students deserve more healthy options
+ Pretty fair pricing, a small (snack size) is under $5
+ North Shore and Seasider are decent options, and I really like their granola

CONS:
- Consistency is a little off, over-blended too thin
- Presentation isn't as appealing as other places
- Quality could be upped a little, Acai to the T has spoiled me and raised my expectations
- Unless I misunderstood, their loyalty program requires you to spend $90 to get enough credits for a freebie WTH?"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, YUM! The acai bowls are to die for. Not overly impressed with the size selection (huge or huge, basically... unless you get a certain acai bowl, then you can get it in a smaller kids size). I recommend the North Shore and Seasider Bowls - The fruit is always fresh and tasty! Love going there to indulge in something healthy to get my sweet tooth fix!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to say the least, when I pulled up to what I thought was supposed to be bowl of heaven and saw bowl ology. The sign is currently a banner and I wasn't sure if the business was even open. 

Once I walked in, I noticed how clean and bright it was inside. The walls are very colorful! The are to sit is quite small, but it does the trick. The menus include bowls, smoothed, juices, and shots. I was there for a few bowls for my coworkers and I. 

I got the PB lovers with 1/2 acai and 1/2 pitaya, peanut butter was added in this mixture. The toppings were strawberries, bananas, granola, chocolate chips, and honey( I skipped the honey). 

My friends chocolate lovers had chocolate mylk mixed into the acai! The top was filled will bananas, strawberries, granola, and tons of chocolate chips. 

My other friend ordered the berry good. It's toppings were strawberries and blueberries. I can't wait to come back and try other bowls. 

The juices are already bottled and they only had a few choices as compared to what their menu states. If you're UNLV staff or student you get a discount."}
{"text":"It's a small but gorgeous space, with a few benches on the inside. Acai bowls are the latest health-food craze, and I'm glad a shop opened here in Madison so I could finally see what the hype on Instagram was all about. 

It's a little like eating a giant, expensive bowl of ice cream but without the fat, though definitely comparable levels of sugar. It's intended to be \"eaten as a meal\" which probably helps customers like me justify the price to themselves, but I wish they'd be upfront that this is clearly dessert based on some tropical berry. There's likely way more fiber and vitamin C in here than in ice cream though, so I guess there's that. 

Unfortunately, while marketed as a \"super food,\" a quick search will tell you this isn't an FDA approved statement, and there is no scientific evidence that the acai berry has more antioxidants than say pomegranate juice or red wine. It was a little alarming how delicious my bowl was, given that the acai berry isn't naturally sweet. I could feel my glucose levels spiking after the first few bites and decided to freeze the second half of my bowl (regular size, not large) to finish a day later. 

However, if you love the idea of a fruit smoothie you can eat, this is one of few options in Madtown. They also offer fresh pressed juices and smoothies you can drink. I'll come back to see if they have less sweet juice options. 

I was also given the option to add protein powder to my bowl, but they don't currently know how much protein is in the bowl on its own, and are \"working with a nutritionist\" for that information. For people tracking their macros/protein intake, likely those who want that added protein, not knowing how much is in the stand-alone product is a little disappointing. 

Service? WITH A SMILE! Presentation? INSTAGRAMMABLE! Healthy? NICE TRY!"}
{"text":"I came here once and was so excited knowing there would be an acai bowl place right across the university! I feel so bad giving 3 stars. I reason is because California has spoiled me! The quality here at Bowl of Heaven is just lacking, the blend is very thin/over blended, idk, but let's say, it tastes like a jamba juice smoothie bowl. As I was trying out the different bowls my friends and I got, and I really couldn't find that taste of great acai. I am very picky and it really just tastes like smoothies here.. But because it's new, I'm hoping it will get better! I will probably be back if I'm craving something cold and fruity while I'm on campus, but not if I'm specifically craving for acai bowls."}
{"text":"Amazing acai bowls with a ton of choices and three different sizes. Staff is super friendly and will let you make adjustments. Tried the Popeye with almond milk instead of apple juice and the Red Zinger. Both were great!"}
{"text":"As others have said, flawless. I drive there from Anthem be cuz I never regret it. Consistent quality ingredients. Always spotless. Extreme courtesy by everybody.  By only beef is that they don't have one across the street from my house. Acai places can get no better."}
{"text":"Yummy food, happy belly. While on a smoothie bowl kick, I stopped in here for dinner. I ordered the Popeye bowl which has acai, strawberries, pineapple, blueberries, bananas, kale, spinach and MAQ 7. Toppings include flax seed granola, banana and honey. 
I was really impressed with the size of the smoothie bowl for the cost. It tasted great. Very fresh and light yet super filling. It was a great texture, smooth and thick just like you would expect. The topping adds a great crunch. 
It didn't look the most appetizing once I mixed it up because it has spinach and kale. Not that pleasing to look at but it tasted phenomenal. 
Would most definitely go back to try other flavors."}
{"text":"This place is alright, but compared to the other acai bowls I've had in town it's mediocre at best. Acai to the T is okay too but nothing will beat Juice n' Go. Juice n' go is hands down the best acai bowl place in Vegas. Although it has only two locations I would drive to either rather than eat an acai bowl here. I think it's decent and it has other things rather than just acai bowls. Wouldn't buy another acai bowl though. It's too pricy for me. You can get a bowl at juice n go that's bigger than the large here and pay less for it."}
{"text":"I have discovered the new office favorite!! If you would have told me I could eat a smoothy for lunch and feel full, then I would give you some sort of cliche response of disbelief. When I brought my first bowl back and was asked to describe what I was eating, I realized I didn't actually know, so I called it yogurtie-smoothie-goodness. Translation? Heaven.

The yogurt base, is actually a special smoothie blend (you really don't need to also order a smoothie... but you totally can too). They talk a lot about their MAQ 7 which is some sort of super fruit blend. MAQ 7 seems to be in just about everything.

The first visit I had the North Shore Original bowl (regular sized - which is lunch sized, trust me) and added strawberries to the mix. I also ordered a Berry Blast Smoothie, because the smoothie was the original purpose of visiting.

Second visit, as tempting as it was to order the same thing, i knew I should try something else. Enter the Red Zinger. Raspberries were the real star on this one. I was skeptical about coconut water, because that alone is not something I enjoy. But in this blend, I didn't even notice its existence.

One last thing to mention is that their bowls have awesome toppings on top. This fact alone is not earth shattering. What is, is that they put the granola on the bottom too. So when you make your way down, you have a crunchy surprise (in a good way)!

Consider this my new favorite lunch spot. Oh, and it's a healthy one too!"}
{"text":"I'm so grateful a place like this put down roots in Madison! I've had their cold pressed juice (c-power), smoothies (several varieties, all excellent!), and acai bowl (red zinger) and have never been disappointed. It's a perfect pick me up no matter the season. I always feel refreshed and satisfied by any of their menu items because I know the ingredients are fresh and healthy. The large bowls are also truly massive. Their storefront, while small, is really cute. I've also seen Bowl of Heaven partner with different local businesses for events and I love those types of collaborations."}
{"text":"Great selection, always something new to try! Smoothies and bowls are always delicious, but the service is so slow! I get they're making it fresh and that takes time but usually there is a line of customers and only a few people working, I think they need more people preparing the orders, especially on the weekends. Also it would be great if there was more seating inside or outside!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed many açai bowls in California and Nevada from a variety of juice bars. They all offer a slightly unique offering, but the base is the same, and the value for the dollars spent is quite similar.

Açai bowl is new to Madison (only two places have offerings that I am aware of), and perhaps Bowl of Heaven is attempting to create a distinctly Midwestern version, but it's just not hitting the mark for me.

It starts with the staff. The few times I've visited, they've pointed me to the written menu for guidance. At other places I've visited, the staff have been incredibly eager to explain the menu and even offer suggestions (like put the peanut butter on top instead of blended in, so it could scooped with a celery stick). They even exuded pride in making something especially for me. The staff at Bowl of Heaven have seemed hesitant to offer suggestions. Perhaps they don't want to vary from the menu.

It's all about the end product, and I've noticed a huge gap in the blends between Bowl of Heaven and other places I've visited. First, for a very consistent $8-9 price, açai bowls in other cities out west have way less granola (not a filler I'm fond of) and about 2-3 times the fresh fruit on top. The overall size of the bowls out west are about 2x what is served at Bowl of Heaven.

I really want to like this place, as I'm a big fan of the açai bowl, but it's simply not comparable to the standard I have from my experiences elsewhere. In the meantime, I've experimented with açai bowl at home with my Vitamix, and they're turning out great!"}
{"text":"I love acai bowls & was excited to see a place open not far from the strip. I am in vegas a few times a year & hate casino food. My husband & I both got the peanut butter bowls with chocolate pea protein. It was a little pricey compared to what we pay in Arizona for a similar item. It was $22 for just 2 medium bowls. 

The bowl was good. It could have used more fruit on the top & better granola, but I was happy & will be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. From the decor, to the people, and most importantly the bowls! I visit about twice a week and I don't believe I've ever really been disappointed. Reasonable price and the LARGE is LARGE. Morgan helped me today. She was very attentive and happy! A great way to start your morning."}
{"text":"Loved the way did a custome drink for me. I wanted to flavor, no artifical sugar and less natural sugar. They made an awesome green juice for me, which met my expectations fully.  Far better than other juice cains and yes, it is not just juice out here. There OJ was good too."}
{"text":"I never tried an Acaì bowl, but wanted to and thought why not since I had a free small bowl I got from the Rebelbook store. It was welcoming and the person working was nice. She got the bowl out really fast and it great. I didn't know what I was going to think but it was good and it's good for you I think. I had the north shore bowl."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Bowl of Heaven. I ordered the North Shore bowl in the smallest size (children's) and it was a perfect treat during my shopping at Hilldale."}
{"text":"Super glad I found this new place! Bowl of Heaven's acai bowls are tasty and filling! Haven't tried the smoothies yet, but I'm sure they're delicious too. The staff is friendly and the shop is cute and clean."}
{"text":"Finally!  I've been looking for a healthier alternative for breakfast and this place fills that niche! 

I've ordered the Original North Shore and Sea Sider bowls and both have been quite tasty. Ambiance/Decor is spot on, employees are friendly and accommodating, and location is perfect for UNLV students and staff. 

Useful tips:

- 10% Discount with your Rebelcard
- Accepts Rebel Cash
- Has other organic/paleo/vegan items for sale if you're into that.
- In the plaza across from Rebelbooks, between Rumbi Island Grill and Cafe Rio (Replaced Pita Pit). 


I'll definitely be back to try more items from their menu!"}
{"text":"Super accommodating and knowledgeable staff. Allergen friendly! The bowl I had was super delicious and I had a lot of energy after eating it. Will be a place I stop each time I'm in Madison now!"}
{"text":"I like coming here for a special treat with one of my kids or with friends that are visiting.  It's a little out of the way but worth the trip.  Fairly quick for making bowls or smoothies from scratch.  Downside is it's kind of pricey but I don't go there all the time so I make it work."}
{"text":"Wow amazing. I love the look of the place. The staff is really nice and accommodating. Everything is fresh fresh from the garden. The bowl was well beyond full and the smoothie was one of the best I found. Worth the drive to try this place. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've had Bowl of Heaven a few times now. First off, I absolutely love that they are dairy and soy free. It's refreshing to go to a place that truly values your health. I also love that there are little blurbs about what each cup or bowl does for you. 

The first time I went in I tried the Purple Rain smoothie. I thought it was interesting because of the purple corn that they use, along with the coconut milk vs. soy milk. The second time I went in I got the Pumpkin Delite which is ABSOLUTELY delicious, and limited time only. Totally worth it, especially with the crushed graham crackers that you suck up through your straw. Yum!

This spot is nice and refreshing. Keep in mind though that because they use such fresh ingredients and blend everything together right after you order it, it takes a little bit longer than your standard smoothie shop. (I promise it's worth the wait!)"}
{"text":"Oh man...so excited that Madison finally has a place like this!  Moved back to the Midwest after being on the West Coast for years and desperately missed my açai bowl treats.  No longer the case - huge fan of the Popeye.  And the ginger shots are AMAZING."}
{"text":"So nice to have something not heavy and (hopefully) nutritious for lunch! Service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"I just tried this for the first time today. I had the NorthShore Acai bowl and a shot of wheatgrass. Both were yummy and healthy. They cut the wheatgrass from a growing plant and juice it right in front of you! The menu looked refreshing and I want to try it all. I will definitely be coming back here. The healthy movement is rising and it's nice to have this place close by. Located right across from UNLV beside Cafe Rio. Check it out !"}
{"text":"YES.

I love you bowl of heaven, for giving me a DELICIOUS, healthy meal alternative that my body actually craves!

My current favorite is the Pumpkin Delite smoothie which contains: Actual pumpkin, strawberries, banana, non dairy cool whip, and graham crackers. My husband thought it was a shake, and I'm like, UH UH, it is packed full of fruits and no dairy! BA DAM! I have not tried the Acai bowls yet, but they look super awesome too!

As someone previously mentioned, these are comparable price wise with say a meal from somewhere like Chipotle, but that is because it is to be considered a meal, not a snack. But believe me when I tell ya, one of those shakes will last me from lunch until dinner because there is a ton of fiber in it that honestly does make you feel full!

Also, the service here is awesome! Everyone here is super friendly and makes the experience that much better!"}
{"text":"I would rather go get ice cream for a sweet high calorie treat (don't let anyone convince you this is low calorie/healthy). \"Healthier\" possibly when more responsible portioning is used but in reality this is just dessert."}
{"text":"One of the best acai bowls ive had in a while! Fruit tastes really fresh& their sizes are a good amount for the price!"}
{"text":"I ordered a berry smoothie from Bowl of Heaven.  It was very thick, filling, and tasty, but in total was nothing to shout about.  It was a quality smoothie, and no doubt healthy, but still just a regular smoothie.  A little chunkier than I like, which made it tough to drink through the straw.  Not bad, but I will be trying other health stores for my smoothie fix in the future."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast this morning with some of my coworkers and we all LOVED it!!!! We got the popeye acai bowl, which on the paper looks like it wouldn't taste that great because it contains a lot of greens, but it was just delicious. The granola and banana slices on top were the perfect combination, and  the acai puree on the bottom tasted so good that we couldn't believe that it was actually healthy!

Staff was really friendly and helpful, since they helped us pick what bowl to purchase. The bowl took a little time to come out, but it was for a good reason: they make them as soon as you order, all from natural, fresh, and healthy ingredients!!! Then the staff members bring the bowl to you with a smile on their face.

We ordered medium size bowls, which were big enough to satisfy each of us. Definitely going to hit this place again! Probably going to make it my weekly treat!!!!"}
{"text":"Acai bowls here are the best, order online to avoid the line. It takes easily 7 minutes for them to make your food, the line builds fast on weekends especially."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times in the last week. While their bowls are great, the service is not. It's taken no less than 10 minutes and even 15 minutes to make my smoothie bowl. Every other place I've ever been has never taken so long."}
{"text":"This was amazing.
Just like what started in Hawaii. I love it so much, better than frozen yogurt and healthier toppings I think too!
Very happy with it and the location is great. Great staff and clean store in general. You HAVE to check it out!"}
{"text":"This bowl of heaven is amongst the top acai places around. Very clean, staff was very helpful with the menu. Pretty sure the owner was there making bowls. Hard to find a quality acai place in town and I have definitely found one here. Great meal/snack to have before or after my classes. Located by the book store. Check Em out."}
{"text":"This business literally runs like a well oiled machine. Customer service was flawless to say the least. The products they serve are fresh and very good. On top of that the place is extremely clean. If you don't check this place out you are making a mistake. As Nike says \"just do it\""}
{"text":"Purchased a smoothie and a bowl.  Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice.  The bowl was great but the smoothie was not edible so I tossed out. $16 is expensive for what I got."}
{"text":"The employees are very nice and accommodating. Although, the prices are a bit too much for the amount you get. :/ I wanted to add peanut butter, but seriously.$1.50 to add it..

I got the pitaya. Really good though!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Bowl of Heaven! I'm here at least once a week because I constantly crave acai! I get the regular peanut butter bowl and it is more than enough to fill me. I love coming here because it is such a nice place and the workers are also really nice!"}
{"text":"We found this place when our regular spot Daily Kitchen Closed just down the street. 

We were in the mood for Acai Bowls. I chose the Sea Sider & my husband chose the Red Zinger. Sea Sider was good but had very little granola or fresh fruit. The Red Zinger tasted too much of ginger for me but over all both had a generous amount of Acai smoothie blend.

Cute & clean location that offers wifi."}
{"text":"I feel like I need to give two separate reviews here. One for the food, and one for the price. The acai bowls, without question, are delicious. The acai smoothie part is fresh, along with the ingredients the employees there add in (it even takes a few minutes for them to add in the different toppings). However, the price for the bowl is absolutely outrageous. Mostly all of the Regular size bowls are $7 or $8, with mostly all of the large bowls being $10. I know the ingredients are fresh, but also know that it doesn't cost nearly as much to make these bowls as they seem to be priced.

I guess the price makes sense if it really will act as a full meal replacement. However, even though the bowls are great, they don't seem to have enough variety in them to act as a full meal."}
{"text":"I was craving an acai bowl so I made a special trip hoping I would make it in time before closing - Saturday hours posted on the website, Yelp and on the door say they are open until 4pm. 

I arrived at 3:48 all the lights were shut off, chairs put up onto tables and no one in the store. 

UPDATE:

I returned yesterday to try again for a bowl because I have a sore throat and wanted something delicious and cold to soothe it, I got the North Shore bowl and it was great! Huge portion for the regular size but I licked the bowl clean!

Also, after leaving a 1-star review for being upset about their early closure a few days before, the manager offered me a bowl on him to make up for it!  Although I didn't take him up on his offer, this shows that management/ownership truly cares about their business."}
{"text":"Only other place I have seen Bowl of Heaven is Utah so seeing it in Wisconsin made my week! #peanutbutterbowl Every thing about this place is the bomb dot com!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed!  I thought I was getting a bowl with fruit on top of the acai and there was only a few banana pieces and hardly any granola.

I recommend the acai bowl at Rachels kitchen a few doors down if you want the real deal.  Or the one in Waikiki Beach but that will cost you a plane fare."}
{"text":"No that good and Price is $$, the coffee I order like drinking water. They don't have coffee latte.

Two star for the clean and nice area."}
{"text":"Yummy bowls. But portions leave more to desire. Staff was pretty dull :( didn't even smile."}
{"text":"Overall, it's good. The bowls are delicious but, expensive and often too big. I also think the wait time can be a bit long, I fully understand they are making things fresh but I have waited 15 minutes before... it's delicious but just not worth the price."}
{"text":"It's kind of like ice cream. But healthier?

The star of Bowl of Heaven, the acai bowl, features a layer of crunchy stuff on the bottom, with sweet purple acai whip in the middle, and then more crunchy stuff and fruits or other toppings to complete.  I realize this is quite generic, but all of the bowls are structured in this way. The regular bowls are really quite large and can be split between two people. The Seasider bowl features 4 different fruits, granola, coconut shavings, nondairy milk, and some sort of powdered subsance which is supposed to be healthy (MAQ7). I can't really imagine making a meal out of a bowl frequently--I would consider it a hearty snack, but to me a smoothie is just not a meal.  I had a smoothie on another occasion, but I missed the texture contrast of the bowl.

The store is small, but very clean and welcoming, and has outlets and wi-fi, as well as a restroom (Hilldale really doesn't have many restrooms now that I think about it.) For vegan and nondairy customers, you'll find plenty of options. 

Overall, it's a different alternative to a treat like ice cream, you can feel a little virtuous that you got in some fruit servings!"}
{"text":"Who knew Heaven could be so costly?  Currently in a month long cleanse, Bowl of Heaven was exactly what I was looking for. I opted for a large Red Zinger Bowl.  The bowl had a decent amount of fresh fruit (blueberries, rasperries) and I thought the ginger brought a nice \"bite\" to the frozen bowl.  Fair warning:  The large bowl is definitely large.  For most, it could probably serve as two servings. But at over $12 (I added a few add ins), it can be a pricey trip."}
{"text":"I had my first acai bowl here and was pretty impressed. The fact that it was supposed to ne healthy as it tasted like froyo/a thick smoothie really  sold me! There were several different types of indulgent toppings, from granola to dark chocolate - a very filling snack/light meal. The flavors were good and the options all seemed great. I would say that it is a bit pricey so be prepared to pay quite a bit more than your average froyo or bowl of ice cream, but the ingredients so seem to justify the price."}
{"text":"**FOR BOWLOLOGY - NEW COMPANY, SAME OWNER**
So I came here again on 4/11/16 for lunch after looking at the competition's prices. Bowlology is far more reasonably priced than any other place in the area (mostly juice and smoothie bars). The price Bowlology charges for their large is in most cases less than what the other places charge for their smallest size. I loved my first experience here and now that I'm more enlightened about the pricing of acai bowls, I think this place deserves 5 stars.

Additionally, my second experience was even more fantastic than the first. There was a sweet girl that helped me decide what to order. First, I knew I wanted the PB lover and she recommended pitaya instead of acai so I did that. I've changed my diet to mostly vegan (and I maintain 100% vegan on weekdays) so I was concerned about the chocolate in the bowl. She went to the back to check the ingredients and we confirmed that it was not vegan. She was however able to use the vegan raw cacao powder in the bowl instead. She also dusted the top of the bowl with this powder instead of the honey drizzle. She did all this with a smile and did not seem inconvenienced at all. Excellent customer service!

The bowl, which I ordered a large of, was once again delicious. I shared some with my brother and he thought it was amazing as well. I will definitely keep coming back! I hope they change their name on Yelp soon so this can be a proper review of the new company."}
{"text":"The key to a successful acai bowl is all in the layering and let me tell you, this place has it down pat. With every spoonful you should have equal amounts of creamy goodness, crunchy granola and fresh fruit, and that is exactly what you get here. So, so delicious! Done so, so, so right.

The North Shore original can be made in a kiddo size which was perfect for my little one, age 5. I had the pitaya (dragon fruit) because I just can't resist any food that perfect pink color and it was bananas! (Pun intended). My other daughter had the lime. I tasted them all and you can't go wrong with any combination, really. We had no leftovers. Not because they're not large enough, in fact, quite the opposite, rather because they are insanely delish! Prices I thought were comparable to what I'm used to paying back home. 

The place is small and the bowls do take a little while to create, but I was prepared for that as I make these myself at home and know what goes into making one. Be patient, they're absolutely worth the wait. They do have an option to call your order in which is awesome! They have a tiny, but much appreciated by me and loved by the kiddo play area too so the littles don't get antsy. 

Oh, we had a bit of a hard time finding the place. It's located in the shopping area behind Target, in the alley with Lush and Free People. Ummm.... Hell yea!! 
What a great stop!! Worth the drive out of downtown Madison!"}
{"text":"It took 15 minutes to get my regular tasting $8 smoothie, 25 minutes for my boyfriend to get his Sunrise bowl. You would think that they were waiting for the damn fruits to grow in the back or something. Definitely not worth the wait. Try Jamba Juice instead. They won't have you sitting there like a moron, and their menu is not as pretentious."}
{"text":"Found my Heaven on Earth..been looking for a good acai bowl since moving herevery friendly staff..and Onolicious Acai Bowls!"}
{"text":"Super delicious. I can't remember the name
of the smoothie my boyfriend and i decided on but it was super refreshing and we loved the kick of lime. My only complaint is that this place doesn't open earlier in the morning. I would love to have this before work."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to try an Acai bowl, but I had never gotten around to trying one until I went here. I have to admit that I just don't get the hype, at least for the price point. It is a smoothie with some artfully laid out granola and sliced fruit on top. It is refreshing and beautiful, but it is $10 for a large bowl of the stuff. The smaller ones are a few dollars cheaper. 

The place is super clean and I appreciated the friendliness of the staff. They also have a rack of packaged health foods items for purchase and some complimentary lime water. 

If you are into Acai bowls, definitely check this place out. I will keep waiting for a nationwide systemic change where fresh and healthy dishes cost the same as fast food junk. I will keep dreaming on that and until then, I will make smoothies at home or use this as just an occasional delicious treat."}
{"text":"Having never had an Acai bowl, I was worried about ordering and finding something I would like. Newbies fear not! The staff are great and will walk you through the whole process. I felt completely at ease.  

I ordered a Popeye bowl because I wanted something with some greens.  The color was a little off putting, but the flavor was fantastic. For those who don't know, Acai bowls are much like ice cream or frozen yogurt in consistency. I switched the apple juice this bowl is usually prepared with for coconut milk (made in-house) which gave a really creamy consistency although I didn't notice a coconut flavor. My only complaint is that there wasn't more granola! That stuff is delicious! Next time I want to customize my bowl with different toppings, and I think I'll need to try a juice soon.

The space is small. There are 4 tables that seat 2 each and a tiny counter by the window. Most people took their orders to go. It does take a bit to get your order as each is hand made. But it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Thought it may be a chain, Bowl of Heaven is a Madison gem. It's perfect for when you want to satisfy your sweet tooth, but feel healthy while doing so. They bowls here keep me feeling full for most of the day and they're all delicious! The staff are super friendly and accommodating as well. Definitely check it out if you're in the Hilldale area - even if it's -20 outside, it's worth the inevitable brain freeze."}
{"text":"This is my first time so I kind of went to the side to look at the menu for a little & the lady at the counter didn't roll her eyes or anything & was very patient with me (although there were guests behind me). She was super kind & genuine w a huge smile on her face. 

I had the Large Purple Rain ($9.99): organic acai, purple corn, pineapple, blueberries, cinnamon, unsweetened coconut milk & MAQ 7. One of the best smoothies I have ever had. It's a perfect balance of acai, purple corn & coconut milk. Well blended & not chunky like some smoothie places. I will be back to repurchase!

They offer a 10% discount for UNLV students!! (I'm in Vegas for spring break but she still gave me a discount for being an SDSU student) :)

5 stars for friendly service, modern atmosphere, large selection & taste of product, they have complimentary cucumber lemon water & outlets along the periphery if you want to chill & do homework."}
{"text":"The Acai bowls are so yummy! Unfortunately, the girls that work here are not very friendly. I was not greeted or acknowledged when entering and the girl was very rude and sounded annoyed when I was ordering. I ordered the Sea Sider which was delish, but I think I'll just go to a different BOH location or Acai to the T down the street."}
{"text":"The acai bowls suck. Plain and simple. It was bland and was more of a dusty lavender color and not a purple. We waited 20 minutes for a bowl and a smoothie. The staff, while friendly, were extremely slow. Not much else to say other than I would never come here again for an acai bowl."}
{"text":"I was mislead by the picture.  The amount of ingredients in the large bowl of \"heaven\" was disappointing...  Too much of some not enough of anything else really. Not very flavorful , tastes like a acai drink blended with ice. I have had much better acai bowls before...."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is well priced in big portions. The root boost is yummy!

Serious note- being that it is so close to Unlv parking sometimes can be a nightmare."}
{"text":"I like the way the place looks and feels. It's very bright and they have other healthy options! It's perfect for after the gym. On the walls they have all these super fruit posters and an explanation which I thought was cook!

Although, I will say that I am picky when it comes to acai bowls. The blended portions of my bowl still had some mango chunks and tasted more like strawberries than acai. I have been to better acai bowl places. I was a little put down because I was expecting a certain taste and it didn't come through. Well, maybe a little! 

I will say that I liked the way they put shredded coconut it was something good that they added and it was a yummy touch!

I do want to go there again and give it another chance."}
{"text":"The bowl was delish but the service was slow. We were waiting for about 20+ minutes for a regular peanut butter and a small north shore. We saw others come and go with their orders while we were waiting for our order to be completed. I went up and stood at the counter hoping to ask why there was a delay with our order. We stood at the register and all the employees were at the back counter either making food or standing watching others make bowls/smoothies. The girl who originally took our order came up and asked what we needed. I asked about our order. She rudely rolled her eyes and asked what name is the order under. I tried to explain that she initially didn't take my name. She raised her voice and told me that they always take a name. I tried to explain that she didn't ask my name when we ordered. She rolled her eyes at me again and asked what our 2 names (I was with another person) were and what we ordered. I told her my name and she huffs off in disgust to the back counter, grabs the order sheet off the order holder on the back table and yells at me \"See! We always take a name!\" (I paid with a credit card and she got my name from my card which I was unaware of). She then barks at me that they had in deed called my name but I was nowhere in sight. She gives me the regular peanut butter and then barks at me that my small north shore will be done soon. As a customer, I'm wondering how my food was done previously and you were looking for me when you are now glaring at me and someone behind you is still making my food order?? Also, your shop is small and the wait for food is so long that people need to stand outside to wait for their orders. When you call names, make sure to 'inconvenience' yourself to check outside for people. There were others standing in line who actually commented to me about her rudeness."}
{"text":"I'm probably addicted to acai bowls, but it's so worth it. I added bee pollen to my bowl not knowing the benefits it actually offered. Look it up! They have so many add-ins to choose from and you can always customize your bowl. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place really is as delicious as people say! I tried the red zinger bowl and it did not disappoint. A regular size is pretty big all on its own and the large size would be a very shareable lunch. Most people I saw ordering here were two people and one bowl - maybe they were having just a snack but either way.

All of the ingredients were fresh, and the acai was blended to cold, almost frozen yogurt like,  perfection. I've heard that all menu items are supposed to clock in at less than 500 calories (for the BIG size) but it's difficult to find nutritional information for any of the items. As long as one is not adding too many bananas, peanut butter, and chocolate it should be a very reasonable meal - but who wants to be reasonable! 

I do wish they had more waiting space as it does get awkward/cramped when there are people dining and buying, however, they do have an online ordering system which is perfect for lunch time and a frequent buyer's club - just use your phone number (no cards needed)."}
{"text":"Wow first hand experience having an Acai bowl here and it was amazing  I never had one before and my friend recommended this place! I ordered the Peanut butter Acai bowl and it was 8.63 for a regular. Not bad because all of the ingredients used are organic and vegan friendly so the price is actually worth it. Definitely my spot to have a healthy craving!!"}
{"text":"Smoothie was good,  but pricey! I think the only thing other than basic coffee and tea under $6 was orange juice. Size coices were 16 and 20 oz, both of which are giant for a snack. If you are in to smoothies or cold pressed juices as a meal (or of course, their acai bowls), this is probably a good option for you.  For me? Not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Looking for a healthy alternative to all those super fatty fast foods UNLV is surrounded by? Gave up meat, can't eat meat, or don't eat meat? You have two choices: you could either cook your own grub at home or you could visit Bowl Of Heaven. Located next to Cafe Rio across from the Student Union, it is the newest acai bowl shop! 

AMBIANCE: 4 - Small, clean, new. Ah, the freshness of new businesses! It makes you thankful that Vegas always opens several new places all the time. BOH doesn't seat many, but is is bright and inviting, simple and super organized. For college students, it's really the place to be! To be...you know, healthy!!  

SERVICE: 5 - The staff are all friendly and super helpful. They're sweet and all have their biggest smiles on. The managers/owner are always checking to see if everything is tasting good & if you're enjoying it! Not to mention, they crank out bowls super fast--like they were born to make them! 

FOOD: 4 - BOH sells acai bowls, smoothies, and juices on their menu. Also, how  you order will depend on what you like and your tastes are. I usually like traditional flavors, so you know what my favorite bowl is: The North Shore Original! The staff recommended the Red Zinger bowl for my next visit, and honestly, I can't wait to try it! 

I do admit that I wish it was open at 7:30 so I could grab some before my morning class. I'm definitely guilty of being one of those students that munch during biology lecture! 

I don't claim to know a ton about acai bowls. Honestly, I haven't consumed many....yet. But I do know taste, and Bowl of Heaven is pretty yummy! Sometimes, you just need a new way to get healthy, and BOH is definitely the new best way to eat healthy at UNLV!"}
{"text":"As far as I've been concerned, acai bowls have been on the rage in California, but I haven't heard a peep about it here in Vegas. This place was apparently a food truck turned solid business of some sort, but it was my first time trying it and I can say it's pretty legit.

While on the pricey side, they've got a vast selection of bowls to choose from, along with other smoothies and pressed juices. 
The two times I've been here, I've had the \"popeye\" and some other one with raspberry and chocolate. Both were awesome, but I have an addiction to acai anyway so I guess they could of mixed it with shit and I'd still think it tastes good. 

The bonus is you can get them in these gigantic freak bowls that are enough for an elephant to eat (MURIKA) so you can feed your addiction throughout the day. Like a responsible crackhead. Got the munchies? Pull out your acai bowl! About to bomb your exam? Pull out your acai bowl! Want to choke your boss/professor? Pull out your acai bowl! Can't sleep? Pull ou... 

Everything is better with acai, put it in your life now. Stay in school, keep off drugs, eat your vegetables(and acai)."}
{"text":"This place is great!! They have a good selection of acai bowls, fresh squeezed juices and smoothies. The staff is very friendly and well educated on the benefits of their juices. They use fresh fruits and veggies for the juices. I am a Las Vegas local and a fitness nut, It is hard to find a healthy alternative to any of the fast food, especially near the strip. It's nice to have a place that offers gluten free selections as well as GMO free and organic options. I am Definitely a regular here! If you like juice or healthy options you will love this place to!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I visited Madison to discover they had Acai bowls. I got the Sunset bowl and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The fruit was fresh and the entire bowl was refreshing. Don't hesitate when deciding to go to Bowl of Heaven - You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This location is very nice, clean, and friendly. They have wifi and charging stations at the tables. The menu offering is great. I find the similar dishes are better at Acai to the T in Summerlin. I would really like this location but they are more expensive for less product. The blending stations are extremely loud. If you visit a starbucks you will see that they have devices made to reduce the noise, and this location does not have them."}
{"text":"After going to Acai to the T made me thankful for this place. My favorite place to get an acai bowl either before class or after school. I love that it's right next to UNLV and students get 10% off. The staff is always friendly and helpful. :)"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open after trying their acai bowl from their food truck. Located across the street from UNLV (Greenspun building/ Student Union) and same lot as Cafe Rio, Rebel Books, etc. I marched here and dragged a friend with me after class. 

They have acai bowls, smoothies, and fresh juices. I avoid bottled/pre-packaged fruit juices as they're loaded with sugar even if they claim to be organic/ natural/ healthy and what have you - fresh is where it's at. They also have vegan cookies, granola bars, MAQ 7 juice (7 super fruits: maqui, Siberian pineapple, cili, goji berries, acai, Alaskan blueberry, and gac), Bowl of Heaven mercy such as caps and shirts. What they don't have is nutrition facts - not even on their website. Their protein is plant-based (pea, hemp, chia seeds and rice).

North Shore Acai Bowl:
Acai, strawberries, bananas, granola, honey, MAQ7 juice, apple juice, blueberries, hemp and flax seeds. Great flavor and texture combination. I love the granola they use because they're crispy and not the typical crunchy-but-chewy-stick-to-your-teeth granola texture. 4/5

Peanut Butter Acai Bowl: 
Peanut butter, acai, bananas, granola, honey, MAQ7 juice, chocolate almond milk, strawberries, blueberries, hemp and flax seeds. I added chocolate protein powder (you can add 11g or 22g of vanilla or chocolate protein powder to anything).  I typically hate chocolate + peanut butter combo so, I'm not sure what I was thinking for getting this. But oh my, was it delicious! This would probably be the menu item with the highest calorie content. I would guess the regular bowl I got was at least 800 calories - perfect for those who are bulking or those that have a crazy metabolism like me. 5/5

Clean and spacious interior. They have tables and chairs as well as bar/counter top area with plugging stations. There's free wifi - just ask them for the code.

I noticed that they currently have only 2 sizes for the bowls: regular and large ($2 difference but portions aren't that much different) and they're not set up for online ordering and rewards program yet. However, they've only been open for 2 days so, calm down. They're giving out free samples, pens and fridge magnet clippy things.

I'm just happy that we have a nutritious option around campus. We can have fruits, veggies, protein, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents served deliciously in a bowl or cup instead of lard slapped onto carbs!"}
{"text":"I like Bowl of Heaven a lot. The consistency of their Acai bowls is superb. The one I normally go to is across the street from school. I'm not sure if they treat me better at that location than here because I go there a lot. But the point is service is not the same. The good thing about this location, I must say, is that they open early (7am)...but this is not my usual morning route so, it doesn't really matter to me.

My favorites include: Sea Sider, Peanut Butter, North Shore, and Sunset. Whatever the choice may be, I like adding protein because I need it. The granola they use stays crunchy.

You get points for being a regular customer. They have bars, dried fruit, and other health foods.

I just wish the people that work here would smile more and at least pretend to be friendly."}
{"text":"Loved this new Bowl of Heaven. I started with a tangy ginger shot which instantly woke me up. The North Shore Acai Bowi was a winner, better than the competitors. I could taste the honey! I finished it off with a Green Glory drink. The owner suggested to add ginger and ice... Genius! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Love all of their juices, smoothies and bowls. BUT the wait time is unreasonable. It takes about a half hour to get your order. So unless you have an hour to spare to order and wait for your order, don't come here. They really need to put more than one person working at a time."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The staff were incredibly friendly and let us try some things before ordering!you can make any modifications to the bowls, which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Josh is amazing!   I'm not sure if he's the owner or just team member but he's amazing...and handsome too!   Just left dentist next door over and I needed something cold and he made me this Orange Julius type drink!  So yumma and great service!   :) thanks Josh :)"}
{"text":"Update on review. This place is much better calling ahead if ur in a hurry. Thanks for your great customer service :-)"}
{"text":"Very nice to have a new place in the neighborhood for blast or lunch.  Beautiful buildout, cool look clean vibe.

It's a nice healthy alternative.

I wish them success and hope to see more open up  in town.

I don't know why they have a talk show blasting on the stereo about recovery after loss of a love one?  Hence 4 of 5 star..."}
{"text":"Amazing ! SO many options and all fresh. I love how you can customize things! I had a delicious pumpkin bowl special in October with all fresh ingredients, really appreciate the dairy free whip topping and ingredients ! Also got the green glory juice and it's delicious ! So so good! Can't wait to come back !"}
{"text":"Alleluia for Bowl of Heaven!
Now Vegas has another place for acai lovers to worship and it's located right across from UNLV on Maryland Parkway.  Thanks to Ms. Fitness Cathy C. for her review and letting us know they're open for biz. 
I had the small Popeye bowl and it had a nice, thick consistency with great acai flavor; I could see little pieces of green from the spinach and kale.  Did I just feel my muscles grow?

-$7.99 regular bowls, $9.99 large bowls
-plethora of acai bowl combinations to choose from, as well as smoothies and juices
-'boosts' to enhance your order include vanilla, chocolate, fresh kale, fresh spinach, mint, ginger, organic pitaya, organic acai

Open 8:00am-6:00pm for your assorted heavenly antioxidant fixes."}
{"text":"Went to the grand opening of this place and the workers were really friendly. They gave out samples for you to try before you bought them. 

Being from Hawaii, I have high expectations for how my acai tastes. I would rate the acai a 2.5 just because it taste exactly like a jamba juice smoothie with granola and bananas on top.  It doesn't even taste like acai! Not that great. If you want good acai in vegas, I recommended Acai to the T!"}
{"text":"Bowl of Heaven is great. It's definitely a healthy option and a great addition to Hilldale.

When I first came, I go the Sunset (or was it Sunrise?) Smoothie - the one with mango in it. I really enjoyed it. It was just what I needed on a hot summer day.

Last weekend, I ordered an acai bowl. Except, it wasn't an acai bowl. I am pretty sure I got the Sunset/Sunrise smoothie in bowl form. I loved it! I never thought to make a smoothie then put it in a bowl and add crunchy stuff to it. I'm sure I could easily do this at home, but that is no fun.

They have a loyalty rewards program. It's free to join and points don't expire!"}
{"text":"Best acai bowls in town. The MAQ 7 mix is a great add. Everything is excellent and the store is designed really well - customer service also great. I've had several of the bowls and smoothies all ready and each one hits the mark. GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Not nearly enough banana slices on there for me. I'm used to the bananas and other fruits LAYERED on top. For what you pay, you SHOULD get more fruits. Oh and that ball of peanut butter on top costed me an extra $2. It's the size of a melon baller. Probably won't be back unless I'm passing by. Meh."}
{"text":"First time here and I must say they have the best sorbets and the acai bowl was to die for. The owner (I'm assuming he was the owner) was extremely nice and I mean I couldn't believe how helpful he was. I will definitely keep coming back and would recommend for anyone looking for a delicious post gym snack."}
