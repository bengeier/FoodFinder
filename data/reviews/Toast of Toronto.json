{"text":"There are not that many choices for food in Terminal 3. I would avoid this place if you can though.   Staff is very slow and hard to comprehend. The lady in front of me had a tough time paying for her purchase. It took nearly 10 minutes for the two of them to conclude a $2.00 transaction.   The traveler wanted to use U.S. currency to pay and the cashier couldn't decide what exchange rate to charge. The sign posted at the register had an outdated rate listed and the cashier kept mumbling a number that the customer (or I for that fact) couldn't understand.   My total time in line was 15 minutes to obtain a bagel and orange juice. And I was the second person in the line.   I should have just walked away..."}
{"text":"Best breakfast option I could find at 6am in Terminal 3 at YYZ. Egg & Cheese Panini on your choice of bread or bagel. $6.77.  Toast of Toronto also offers toasted bagels with cream cheese and a bunch of to go cold items like salads, various sandwiches, cold bagels with real cheddar cheese, breakfast pastries, yogurt etc.   Their cold beverage case offers my number one airport necessity - sparkling water & it looks like they turn into more of a deli and bar as the day goes on.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"Lazy and unmotivated staff. Two workers chat while 8 empty tables wait for much needed wipe. When i suggested one worker do so she slowly moved around wiping with a dirty cloth, then returned to chat With coworker and snack on cafe food. Salad fine and soup quite good so owner should act now before others avoid."}
{"text":"This is a great deli bar. There aren't very many options in terminal 3 and I was at gate B40 so it's right across the hall. Prices were comparable to subway but a much higher quality of food. I was very impressed with the sandwich I bought, it was delicious and so big I couldn't finish it.  The only thing they need to improve on is their speed. It took a few minutes for me to go through and there wasn't even anyone else in line. I had time to kill between flights so it wasn't an issue but if you're in a rush I wouldn't recommend, especially if there is a line.  Overall I would eat here again while travelling."}
