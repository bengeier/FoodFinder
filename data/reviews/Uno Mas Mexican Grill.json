{"text":"I ate there for the first time today, and I loved it. Good, reasonably-priced food (especially for downtown) and it reminded me of the little Mexican restaurants in northern Colorado where I'm from. Friendly staff and peaceful atmosphere"}
{"text":"About the only taco/burro joint right downtown.  Serviceable...oak...satisfied a craving"}
{"text":"I had an awful hangover and their chorizo burrito came to the rescue. I was a little unnerved by the fact that the chorizo was sort of pinkish red but it tasted fine and put me on the road to recovery."}
{"text":"The tacos taste great, but they are greasy. Seriously greasy.  Way too much grease.  It's a bummer."}
{"text":"3.5 but rounded up to 4   It is quick and convenient when I am jonesin' for Mexican food.  No frills, just simple standard Mexican fare (tacos, burritos, tamales, etc).  They have a different soup every day of the week.  My favorite day is Wednesday - Cocido Day.  Cocido/Caldo de Res is a flavorful simple beef broth with chunks of simmered meat. large pieces of potato, carrot and cabbage.  A very simple soup but satisfying.   Friday is Menudo/Posole Day - Again flavorful and satisfying.    Their portions are generous and their prices, I find, are real world and not downtown prices. This also solidifies the 4 star rating.  The staff is friendly and food good.  Simple... easy..."}
