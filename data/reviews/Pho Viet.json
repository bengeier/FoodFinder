{"text":"Delicious! Great service, the food tasted and appeared to be of high quality. Portions were huge!!! I would highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing pho! A little hole in the wall that serves up delicious, warm pho. Can get pretty busy during the week for lunch due to its proximity to Concordia and work places but I can usually find a table for two. I come here a couple times a month and the pho never disappoints. It's also easy on the wallet with prices starting at 7.50 for a small and 9 for an extra large."}
{"text":"For me this place has it all: delicious, fresh, cheap, homey, bring your own wine. The pho is simply amazing, it's extremely flavorful and tastes like the pho in Saigon. It's hard to find a better pho, not just in Montreal but anywhere.

If you go there, take advantage of the real great Vietnamese dishes they have, or ask them what they recommend before you take something stupid like General Tao chicken. Some of my favorites: the pho, spring rolls, caramelized salmon, grilled meats (chicken, porc, beef).

Also, I read the comments about the quality of the service. Well, if you've ever been to Vietnam, you'll see that there isn't such a thing as \"a good service\", it's just not part of the culture. Obviously we're not in Vietnam here and there is a good service at Pho Viet, but I'm just saying, this place is a Vietnamese family-own restaurant, don't take it too seriously on the service, it's about food here. The staff is super nice and casual, take it easy and be nice too, and if you want the bill just ask for it!"}
{"text":"It is a nice place, but the food it disappointed. Because the soup pho should be a little sweet, but it doesn't and also the soup it not clear. I think it is a little pricey, 5 box for 2 salad roll? Not god"}
{"text":"There's not much selections in terms of Vietnamese food in the surrounding area so I was extremely happy when I saw this place.  My expectations weren't high going in because I know the surrounding Vietnamese places aren't that good.

It was a hot day that day and this place had no air conditioning.  Needless to say, Pho is the last thing you would order but I came here for pho and I don't care if I'm soaked in sweat eating it.

I ordered a Pho Sate and when it came out, it actually looked good.  Unfortunately it's not.  They had too much fish paste in their sate and it had very little sate flavour despite the color of the soup.  It was salty...very salty.  I almost didn't finish my bowl which rarely happens!  

Skip this place.  I don't recommend it at all....unless you like pure salt in your soup."}
{"text":"Just ate at Pho Viet based on the first review on Yelp and its 1-block distance from my lodgings. Great pho! Very rich broth with a unique, complex flavor, and the beef was incredibly tender, without the bit of gristle that is common in more hole-in-the-wall places. I missed the plate of spouts, chilis, basil, and cilantro that I have become accustomed to in the States, but this may be a regional thing. A huge bowl of Pho Ba and a homemade lemonade (beh, not the greatest but not bad) was only $10!"}
{"text":"Every time I order take-out, they forget to put in hoisin sauce I specifically ask for, and it makes me wanna drop-kick something.
Also, I've got food poisoning from their sprouts.
Too bad because the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Et moi je ne peux pas croire que je sois la deuxième cette place est blinder de monde très peu de chaises de libre il est 14h beaucoup d asiatique plutôt bon signe ma soupe au buf est tres bonne mais pas la meilleure que j ai mangé le jus  manquait de gout un peu service rapide
Tiens  le the est payant Premier Resto de pho ou je le fais dire que le thé est puant ..., dommage 
Sinon très bonne place allez y si vous êtes dans le coin ça vaut la peine pourra fer rapide bon pas cher 
7.75$ large soupe au buf"}
{"text":"My favourite pho restaurant in Montreal by far (and I've been to a lot of them) No frills place with excellent pho, always packed at lunch at dinner time. 

My wife and I went there for pho at least once a week for more than 5 years, even after we moved out of the neighbourhood.  After a while waitresses (two sisters or cousins I believe) knew I always ordered 11 large!  

Almost a year after leaving Montreal for the US I still miss it."}
{"text":"Being hungry people, we decided to go out for something to eat.  We gave Pho Viet Noodle House a try, instead of the usual, Vietnamese Village.  What a mistake!

The place is reasonably nice inside, and the service is OK, but that doesn't save the food from being just... bad.  

We started with the vegetarian salad rolls. They were small and sort of boring, with some crunchy deep fried tofu inside (actually, the tofu was pretty good), lettuce, and rice noodles.  That's it??!!  You make something 'vegetarian' and you don't even bother to add some VEGETABLES into it? Argh.

I had the beef and spring roll rice vermicelli.  It was 'okay', but it really seemed as if the beef had been cooked hours before and then reheated.  My bf ordered the stir-fried lemongrass beef on rice vermicelli; but the order arrived as chicken instead of beef.  He didn't bother to ask for the mistake to be corrected as, again, we were quite hungry. 

His dish did not taste fresh, it seemed as if the meat had been frozen and then reheated.  

All in all, I would not recommend this place for any occasion. Hopefully in the future some of these problems can be remedied so that this restaurant can produce tasty, quality food."}
{"text":"Decent pho in the area. Not terribly cheap but ok prices.  No complaints, no raves."}
{"text":"This place is just OK.  The Pho there is OK, nothing exciting honestly.  I've only been to a few pho places but this one is probably at the bottom (not saying that it's bad though.....just comparing).  

The place is very clean.  The pho is served in a bowl that's too small to be honest, I didn't have any room to put the bean sprouts in without it seeming like it would overflow the bowl. 

The fried rice is...well....average at most.  I wasn't the biggest fan, but once again...wasn't awful, i've just had better.

Lastly I had thai tea boba.  A bit too sweet for my taste, with not enough boba (which they also \"accidentally\" overcharged me for (they fixed the problem).  I looked over my bill and things didn't really add up...it seemed as if certain things were more expensive than i recall seeing on the menu.

Nonetheless, I probably wont come back here, but I guess it's worth a shot for curious restaurant goers."}
{"text":"I thought that a renovation and a new look would help this place. I live right above it and was excited to see that they were now offering subs. As soon as the server handed me the sub, I knew instantly that it was light. This was the biggest waist of 750 i have ever spent. Do not go here, there are other vietnamese places close that are better"}
{"text":"Really great Thai food and BYOB!  My favorites are the chicken dumplings in satay sauce, Pad Thai, and beef with basil.  We had no issues with service on a Saturday night around 9pm and were sat right away."}
{"text":"Première visite le 15 avril chez Pho Viet,

entrée de soupe au crabe délicieuse et soupe aigre et piquante aussi excellente et différente des soupes aigres et piquantes de d'autres restaurants asiatique (style chinois).

Le rouleau printanier était bon.

Le Sizling impérial  délicieux avec des fruits de mer, du poulet et du buf au gout impeccable, les viandes super tendres. 

Le saumon caramélisé servi dans un bouillon délicieux servi avec des nouilles avec un peu d'huile de sésame.

On nous a offert un dessert gratuitement étant donné que c'était notre première visite, le service était parfait.

C'est un restos Apporter votre vin en plus je le recommande fortement."}
{"text":"Came here because Pica Pica was closed and we didn't really have a plan b. Other reviews are not kidding about slow service. There were only a couple of other tables occupied, but only one server who took her sweet time with everything. Lemonade came after the pho and spring roll app, even though everything was ordered at the same time? And tasted like Country Time powder mix. Maybe that's why it's apportez votre vin? 

Pho was okay but had too much cinnamon in it (?) and was pre-flavored (did not come with the customary basil leaves, sprouts, fish sauce, and lime to make it to your taste). 

Disappointing to say the least. Next time I want pho in Montreal, I'll go back to Pho Bac 97. Or anywhere else."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place has such a low rating. I went here for lunch and had the grilled chicken pho and it was delicious. I had the large and my total bill was $10.50 after taxes. The broth was so flavourful as was the chicken. The pieces of chicken were plentiful and very well seasoned.  
Seating is limited and you walk down a few steps when you come in. When we arrived there was a fair amount of people but we didn't have to wait at all. Overall my experience was good. No complaints. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Quick service and good prices...the food is authentic, but sometimes lacking flavor. The atmosphere is good and pretty clean on the inside, but a little loud. I had a cold when I came in and the spicy beef pho actually cleared me right up! Spring rolls and grilled chicken pho were also really good, and good for picky eaters as well."}
{"text":"Service and food has become too inconsistent for the past few months, and the bean sprouts are never fresh. Sometimes there is too much broth, sometimes too much noodle, and sometimes too much meat, the proportions are never the same.

Spring rolls seemed to be refried, and the grilled stuffs are dry and awful. What a shame.

It is indeed no longer what I experienced few years ago anymore.


To the person who called me a \"flat liar\", perhaps you should refer to the date of my last review before writing anything. Restaurants do change, everything changes, the entropy of the universe is always increasing. Now move on."}
{"text":"Pho = soupe.

C'est donc le meilleur truc a prendre : La soupe est excellente ! gros bol, combo avec 2 rouleaux impériaux pour 8.95$ !
Le service est poli et agréable, ils prennent interac. 

Nothing more to say !"}
{"text":"Cheap, small and cold cut service.

While not knowing much about Vietnamese food, the food was decently cheap with a decent amount of quantity. I am seeing other fellow yelpers with Asian names point out the taste is wrong for what it is. So it might be so. I would not know, this is the first Vietnamese store I ever went to. Service was rather cold and neutral, not unfriendly or friendly but very quick. It seemed to bother some, but not me.

To be honest, while I know those are two extremely different cultures, you have a better selection going at Champ De Mars at a chinatown restaurant. The place looks like a basement that was renovated and separated from a duplex. Pretty dark and quiet (almost depressing) atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yes, its been around forever and the reason it is still in business is because they are very consistent in their food.  So if you love it here - you will always love it.  It's the same place as it was 20 years ago.  That being said, the Pho is 'good' but not outstanding.  The food could use more \"Vietnamese\" in its cuisine as I found the menu pretty basic and non-eventful.  I had the ginger fish which was nice and for desert the fried bananas.  All good.  I would go back if I was in the neighborhood, but wouldn't go out of my way or bring people from out of town here."}
{"text":"Little neighborhood gem! Food is great, at affordable prices. Service could use some help."}
{"text":"Definitely on my top Pho restaurants in montreal. The service is decent, not unfriendly or friendly, but it was definitely quick. The broth is packed with flavour and the noodles are soft yet chewy. This place is perfect if you are looking for a cheap and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"This is a modest eatery found inside the Phoenix Oriental Market. The menu is short - basic pho, rice, and noodle dishes ranging in price from about 5 to 8 bucks. The big bowl of steaming hot pho is tasty and well-flavored with aromatic herbs and comes with the usual side plate of mint and crunchy fresh bean sprouts. The dining space itself is a simple no-frills area, partly open and surrounded by the fresh and refrigerated produce section of the Asian food market."}
{"text":"Good Pho, good price, wish they took a credit card because I'm from San Francisco and love the convenience of plastic.
Quality of the meat is good and delicious broth."}
{"text":"Quick service.

Beef with noodles and salad and roll 10 bucks. It's pretty good for the price. I'm sure there's better spots but this was still a great spot.

Shrimp  says bread crumbs ... nope they were like beer battered very bready. Not at all for me."}
{"text":"It is my opinion that this is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in greater Montreal. 
The first night we went, we were excited by the flavors and freshness of the selections. 

The restaurant is casual, bring your own wine, and family owned.
If you do not see exactly what you want, just ask the owner woman or her daughter and they are so happy to go out of their way to make something just for you.
The beef pho is AMAZING with rich flavor. The fresh rolls with shrimps, mint, and noodles with peanut dipping sauce are a tease. So good that you can not wait for the entree to come. 

Pho Viet is now a must stop for Dennis and I when we visit Montreal. 
We came here TWICE in one week as it was so good!!

Steps away from the gay village and rue St Catherine."}
{"text":"This is my second time having pho in Montreal, the first was pho bang new york, where I found the broth to be bland.

This was not a problem here, the broth is amazingly beefy and you get a hint of sweetness. The pho is packed with different succulent pieces of beef and noodles. It also comes with a plate of bean sprouts, basil and lime. As an appetizer I got the beef and shrimp springrolls which were decent but I wish they had a bit more meat. The best part is it's super affordable at 10.50 with taxes for a large size. Ive been coming here once almost once a week since trying it. The service here is good too and the lady on cash always has a smile on her face."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho restaurants in Montreal for sure. Been there many times in the last 6-7 years, and it has never deceived me. The place is relatively clean, and in a very good location. It's never too busy either. What I like most is that they give a lot of meat compared to the other pho restaurants. The flavour is just right, not bland and not too salty. The service is just ok. The prices are decent, like any other pho restaurant. The only reason why I'm giving it a 4 is because it's cash only. No credit, no even debit, which is a bit bothersome. But overall, would recommend!"}
{"text":"Not recommanded, taste bad, no service, very cheap place. Why people lie about the review before? or they never try whats real vietnamese food"}
{"text":"Pretty decent pho place. Been here a couple times. Che ba mau (rainbow dessert) is crazy good, I asked the waitress and apparently it's homemade or they make it themselves so it's fresher. They put peanuts on the top and it makes it even more delicious. Any pho dishes are good, I usually order the pho tai, i like my raw meat! Service could be better, some of the waitresses don't look too happy to be there but the food makes up for the mediocre service"}
{"text":"the service is not good, misunderstood me and refuse to change the order! Too bad!"}
{"text":"Food quality was good. Had the goi cuon, fresh and authentic. It was clean and the service was good. Pho was good. tastes it will be good. I'll have to try it again next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Les Pho au centre ville ne sont pas extraordinaires... du moins, je n'en ai pas fait l'expérience jusque ici et \"Pho Nguyen\" n'est pas une exception. Une pho honnête, mais le boeuf était tranché un peu épais et était un peu dur. Les rouleaux étaient corrects, mais avec un arrière-goût de creton.

Bref, quand même correct pour une pho au centre ville (mes endroits favoris sont près du métro Jean-Talon)."}
{"text":"Good for downtown.  Small space, mostly students. Sometimes quiet but pretty steady.  There are always people in here every time I come. Price is good.  I sometimes I order pho to go.  I really like the crispy spring rolls but can be oily sometimes.. But this is comfort food for me. Broth is really good. Ice coffee is strong and good too."}
{"text":"Pho is average, nothing special but above all, service is not good. They totally forgot about me and my friend. Many People walked in and got their foods while we still waited for our order. Finally when the waitress walked out and asked to confirm our orders, she read out somebody's order. I was mad and felt like being discriminated."}
{"text":"They have one of my favorite phos in the city - i especially like the use of grilled chicken thigh.

Unfortunately, last night I saw cockroaches on the floor and lost my appetite. I will never return"}
{"text":"Best place downtown to get beef pho ! I also often order the pork and vermicelli when I take out and it's super yummy. The portions are fair and the prices too. The staff is always nice and is bilingual, which is a plus. I would definitely recommend this restaurant !"}
{"text":"Favorite Pho place in Montreal!!! We have tried several others but we keep coming back here for more. Love the beef pho, spicy beef noodles, beef tendon noodles and the viet iced coffee with condensed milk! Almost comparable to those I had in Ho Chin Minh City. The broth is tasty and the noodles are soft yet springy. This place is truly a neighbourhood gem - it always feels homely and there's rarely a big crowd so you know you can count on it for a quick yet satisfying dinner. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The service was nice, the broth of pho was tasty, but not overpowering, the noodles were generously portioned and cooked to perfection, and the price was more than reasonable. Just remember this place only accept cash (there's an ATM at the Metro across the street if needed!)."}
{"text":"My favourite pho restaurant in downtown. I'm not Vietnamese, my vietnamese friends did not really recommend this one, but I guess they adjusted the flavor somehow to cater to non-natives? The soup is very clear without too much oil and tastes good."}
{"text":"We came here because we wanted to go to a BYOB (o \"Apportez Votre Vin\") restaurant in Montreal.  After hearing about Pho Viet, we decided to go give it a try.

The place is small and gives this homey ambience, which was a plus for me.  I got a combo of grilled shrimp on skewer and grilled beef with vermicelli.  The grilled beef was delicious...cooked very nicely.  The shrimp was meh...I had a lot better tasting shrimps than that.

The dining experience was a disappointment.  First, the food took a while to come out, and then the waitress got the order wrong.  My friend order a beef with lemongrass, and she got grilled chicken instead.  When she did get the beef lemongrass, the beef had no essence of lemongrass.  She was very disappointed.  My other friend got chicken with vegetables, which she said was nothing extraordinary.

After dinner, the waitress didn't come give us the check until an hour after we finished our food.  The place was busy but not that busy to 'ignore' us for an hour.

Other than the beef and the BYO, there is nothing great about this place.  Perhaps it is their pho that I should have tried.  Oh well..."}
{"text":"Bonne pho tai (soupe au boeuf saignant), sauf que le boeuf était un peu trop épais et difficile à mastiquer.

Service rapide. Parfait pour un lunch si vous êtes au centre-ville, près de Concordia.

Les prix sont corrects, mais pas vraiment un bargain. Ambiance très familiale et sans prétentions!"}
{"text":"This is a good spot to eat a Vietnamese soup but there's no enough meat..really rare, my last time I did chose a Tonkinois soup, number 10 in the list...and large one but not enough meat and no tripes. Sorry but I won't come back!"}
{"text":"This is delicious restaurant. I had the curried chicken which came with soup , vegetables & rice. Bring your own wine or beer. The hostess was very nice & the food was great!"}
{"text":"If you don't have much time to eat and craving Pho, this is a good place to get a bowl of Pho literally within few minutes after ordering. The broth was full of flavor with different cuts of meat and rice noodles. I quite enjoyed my Pho and was pleasantly surprised how quickly it was served. The service was okay, not friendly but not impolite either. The place could have been cleaner. But then again, a large bowl of Pho will only cost  you $9.50, so it's worth to check it out."}
{"text":"Their bun with pork and imperial roll was really good. Coming from California, I honestly did not expect good Vietnamese food in Montreal. However, this place proved me wrong! The price is also reasonable. I also tasted pho's soup that my friend ordered--it was also pretty good. I'll try it next time!"}
{"text":"Service was good but food was average, prices were high compared to other PHO houses."}
{"text":"When I came to Montreal, it is the first pho restaurant I tried. I hoped that I like it ,because the taste is not too bad, but every time I finish eating in this restaurant, my stomach will be so hurt ,and I will diarrhea! 2stars for the flavor but I'll never back"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick take-out lunch last week. It was recommended by a self-acclaimed pho enthusiast I guess you could say. I had obviously consulted Yelp! before venturing over because it's sort of become my thing! 

I was unsure how take-out would work; would I get a bowl? Would I get everything separately? I got there, and found it was pretty small, but it's a small family-owned shop, so not surprising. Pretty clean and friendly staff. Was greeted immediately and given a menu to look over. Prices are verrry reasonable. 8$ for a large soup is pretty awesome! Took no less than 5 minutes to get my soup and be on my way. It was packaged all separately which I found was convenient; the broth was in a styrofoam container, the noodles and rare beef were in another styrofoam container and the bean sprouts, mint and coriander were in small baggie. On my way back to my office however I was worried as to how I was going to eat my soup. Once back, luck was on my side; I found a large soup bowl perfect for my much anticipated pho. I combined everything, added some hoisin and sriracha and sat down to enjoy my concoction. 

It's definitely a good bang for your buck. I wouldn't call it the best I've ever had, but it's pretty good and conveniently located (considering I work a block away). I added hoisin and sriracha before trying the broth by itself so I can't say what the broth itself tastes like. But all combined, it's a pretty good mix. I would definitely recommend it and will be back in the near future."}
