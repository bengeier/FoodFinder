{"text":"The Huddle is like something out of my California-girl dreams, where something called yinzers talk about awesome blue collar things in weird accents and you watch hockey and drink beer.

It is so exotic! My husband, a Pittsburgh native, thinks of it as your classic neighborhood bar. But a place like this would be overrun with Hipsters in California and they'd charge 6 bux for a PBR. 

They have free popcorn which is amazing. And their food looks pretty good, though I've never eaten here. Actually, once I had cheese fries and they were pretty tasty, huge plate for $4 I think it was. 

Great bar! Very comforting!"}
{"text":"Great local watering hole with excellent wings!"}
{"text":"Two year have passed and my initial impression has changed. Definitely like how close The Huddle is but after many meals here I won't return. Being so close is why we've continued to revisit and the quality was fair enough and sometimes mostly good. The fried fish used to be good but now appears to be frozen freezer bag fare along with their appetizer platter. And the rest of the sandwiches are fair at best. What is most concerning is one occasion when we ordered rare steak instead of medium...they took steak back to the kitchen and put it back on grill. Another meal they took the undercooked salmon back to the kitchen grill and our latest meal undercooked scrod taken back to kitchen as well. Health safety standards...once food makes it to the table it can't be taken back to kitchen and placed back on the grill or honestly even reenter the kitchen. I'm ok enough with that if there was an improvement when you receive the food again. The latest meal no improvement in the undercooked scrod...the fish was not flaky and still had opaque undercooked color. When I told the server she told me...well he cooked it for 7 more minutes. The fish wasn't hot but she was saying it was fine.  No apology no offer for something different. I just said ok...we weren't rude and I didn't want to ask for manager and have more drama...the server would just label us as complainers.  In addition the baked potato was lukewarm at best and my dining companion ordered the eggplant parmigiana which comes with Portobello mushrooms...she let her know the mushrooms had a strong vinegar taste. The server told us those weren't Portobello mushrooms that it was eggplant...hmm ok. Regardless the point was too much vinegar/bad taste no matter what she thinks it is called.  As an aside the menus says there are mushrooms on the dish too. Clearly the server didn't want to hear it or fix it and we just said ok. Aside from this dining experience we've had consistently old lettuce in salads...fried mushrooms still frozen in middle. They took my order of mushrooms back to kitchen and refried them after I had been eating from them. So that's another example of a food safety issue. After many meals and many tries and eating there two to three times a month for a couple years we're done. That's a few thousand dollars lost in future business for them but I'm willing to drive a little farther for a consistently good meal"}
{"text":"Had the ribs, so much amazing tender meat that I didn't know if I'd make to the car. Drinks were reasonably priced, the appetizers were hearty in size, and the service was good."}
{"text":"A great place to have a drink and a meal.  The food is excellent.  I recommend the awesome fish sandwich and the delicious wedgies.  I can't wait to go back and try more!!!!"}
{"text":"\"Okay\" first server showed us are seats and took the drink order, was a bitter \"Betty\" and I was thankful she was not to be the server we had, the next server at our table was more courteous,  in sorts, maybe that is a stretch, okay not much of improvement from the first, tired hungry, ( I am vegetarian so menu very limited ) so I order eggplant parmigiana, well I thought this can't be so bad well when the side salad came I knew I was in danger, they had one wedge of tomato on the salad, trust it has been in refrigeration a tad to long, I was curious cause it was how to say, it looked like a kids play food, you know the plastic stuff, tasted like it too, was not good trust, here comes the eggplant parmigiana,
let's start with the portobello mushrooms on top, they are marinated in some kind of grease & vinegar, if it was olive oil it came from the dollar tree, marinara is hard to mess up, trust they achieved that, and then pairing it with mushroom soaked in vinegar is just gross, trust the side pasta made me literally gag, as for the eggplant, it was frozen trust and not a good brand, Aldi's sold a vegetarian eggplant parmigiana that more stellar than this slop could be, \"PS\" the cheese was so salty my ankles swelled, no lie, I took my left overs, figure this snack was good for the neighbors dog, she will eat anything, but not this lol she looked, sniffed, and looked at me as if I was trying to poison her. I don't believe I will ever grace the door of this place, not on a dare or, if I won a gift certificate, I say run fast don't look twice at this place..."}
{"text":"Good food here, especially for the price. It tastes very much like something your mother would whip up at home. I've yet to find a place in the burgh that can best their price on a nicely cooked piece of steak. 8 bucks for a new York strip that tasted that good is impressive. Their chicken tenders and jalape√±o poppers are a solid choice. Their steak salad is off the chain, not to mention the most famous item there, the Black and Tan wings. Semi-burnt chicken wings coated in a vinegary buffalo sauce that reminds me a little of the beechview community. If you don't know what I mean, you don't live here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the area. The food is always great and the waitresses are friendly. I would recommend the chicken wedgie!"}
{"text":"Everything is always fresh...nothing like home style cooking...comfort food...Top Quality..."}
{"text":"Great experience at the Huddle tonight. Our first time there,the bartender was great. Very friendly and made us feel welcome. Other customers were nice and we enjoyed talking with them. Homemade soups were so good we took some to go...and Philly Cheese steak was great. Not even one complaint."}
{"text":"I've only been to the huddle once. I just moved into the area and live only a few blocks away. I heard the wings were good. By boyfriend is a wing snob so I figured we should should check it out. He said they were alright, cooked well but lacking flavor (tanned wings). I got a turkey burger which was probably not the best choice but I try to eat healthy. It was obviously a frozen turkey burger, something I could have made much better at home. Fun dive atmosphere, nothing fancy, which I like. Service was ok. I will go back and try again, has potential."}
{"text":"This place is so relaxing. The drinks are stiff , beers are cold, and the food reminds me of home. I'm giving it five stars because of the comfort food, steak is amazing, the price is so affordable, and if I'm having a rough week the jack n cokes are strong enough to smooth out the edges. Sometimes it can take a lil while for your check so just ask for it in advance. Never really had anything bad here."}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever eaten in my life!  It was juicy, cooked perfect, and priced unbelievably low for the quality!  All food is cooked fresh and the servers are prompt and courteous.  When you first walk in, the lighting is a bit on the darker side (as most bars are) but you get to the back you can seat yourself and the waitress comes over and gets the drinks.  Alcohol is very, VERY reasonably priced and the drinks are made perfect.  All in all, if you are looking for a GREAT steak at a highly underrated place, look no further."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some A+++ wings. This is your place. The wings are on the smaller side but PHENOMENAL. Possibly the best wings I've ever had. Anywhere. Juicy. Tender. Fall off the bone. Good flavor. I haven't had a bad thing at this place yet. Seriously. Stop reading. Go get some buffalo or tanned wings."}
{"text":"This delicious dive has become our standing a Wednesday night dinner. We love the wings and occasionally have the specials. Check out the board, order any of the soups, and request Amy as your server. They're all good but shes our favorite because she's super friendly and always knows our order. It's fun when your server \"knows your name\" at your favorite place."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has not been reviewed yet.  If you live in beechview you already know about this place, but if you don't you need to try this place out if you are passing through.

At first glance, you will barely notice the bar/restaurant from the exterior.  Inside it is your typical Pittsburgh bar with a some additional seating in the back.  So you would think, why take the time to review this place.  Well they have a old-fashion popcorn machine which they offer free while you are drinking at the bar and this popcorn was phenomenal.  But it only gets better, happy hour pints for 90 cents.  So, delicious popcorn + beer= Great afternoon after work.  Well at this point, I was like wow, this little place well served its purpose for a cheap happy hour on my way home from work. 

And then: The Reuben.  Now I am not the connoisseur of Reubens but, this one was absolutely flavorful.

All in All- check this place out if you are in the area and need to grab a cold one."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love being able to walk across the street to an awesome dive bar with a GREAT menu!
My husband and I used to go to The Huddle once a week... They have REALLY good wings (also wing nights) and food, including daily specials.  The soup was always a must have, with seafood chowder being my favorite.  I always ended up ordering way too much food because it is so reasonable priced.  We'd spend $30 tip included (always at 25% because that's what a good waitress deserves) and leave with boxes of food! Definitely a place to be checked out!!!"}
{"text":"People are not joking about the tanned wings. They are EPIC. They fry them up, cover them in sauce, and then put them in the oven for a bit so the sauce bakes in. They look dry and almost overcooked when they get to your table, but they are incredibly tender and delicious. And they give you tons of good ranch to go with them, too.

This being a divey local place, the service isn't impeccable - my waitress was very nice, but spent a lot of time loudly chatting with the table next to mine. And it really bums me out that they're cash only. They have an ATM, but it of course charges a ridiculous fee.

Overall, though: amazing wings, cheap cold beer, and decor that looks like your grandparents' basement. Good stuff."}
{"text":"... Look... I hate writing a less than stellar review of a business. It actually makes my cold goth baby heart sad. No one WANTS to go somewhere and get bad service, thats just ludicrous. (Not Ludacris, close but not the same.)

I have just recently moved to Beechview and the best part of moving to a new part of this wonderful city is giving new businesses a try! I have sampled so many tasty and amazing new food items and coffee drinks etc etc. I am always in search of a non-smoking bar where I can hang out, eat, drink, and get to know the locals. I prefer small bars with \"yinzers\" as they tend to be a true gauge of a neighborhood for me. 

We have many friends in this area, which means that we got some great tips before we even moved in about different types of food, stores, laundromats, and bars. One of these tips, repeated from friend to friend, was The Huddle. As the name implies it is a bar where you can be certain you can watch a sports game of whatever sport-ball type you're interested in. It is indeed non-smoking, a handful of tables suitable for 4 people and a \"U\" shaped bar right in the center as soon as you come in. It is a cash only establishment with an ATM on site for quick transactions. The have free popcorn from a popcorn machine which makes the place smell amazing. It's been around quite a while which means that there is a great group of locals who frequent the establishment. 

This is truly everything I need in a local bar. We had been in for the very first time for drinks shortly after moving in and happened to be in there on one of their two weekly wing nights. This are not the wee tiny wings, more a weird in between of some of the \"full\" size wings I've had other places that clearly came from giant monster mutant chickens (I mean maybe they were goose wings, who even knows... they were huge) and the teeny tiny wing night wings you find most other places. They have two options; buffalo (sloppy) and \"tanned\" which are buffalo then cooked again so they are drier and crisp and un-freaking-believeable. The prices are mega cheap and it's so filling and delicious we've been back more than once for them. I like this place so much we have even taken the handsome-boyfriend's mother there when she was in town for the weekend. (P.S. She loved it too!) 

My dear sweet lovely readers, here is where I have to talk about something less than all of the amazing parts I've already mentioned. Tonight, both ravenous from too little food and too much work-day, we trekked up the monster that is Coast Avenue for beers and food and a chill environment (that would undoubtably involve pre-season football). We walk in the door and aside from an employee (other than the bartender) and a few people in the back at tables, we are the only patrons aside from one regular. We belly up to the bar on the far side and say our hellos. This is where I get a serious case of the sad. The bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence. Ok, I get it... I work sort of indirectly with the public I have days where I can't handle people. It happens! As customers come in and sit down, she greets them with a warmth that was clearly lacking. Ok. That's sort of disappointing but still fine. When we got to the point that we asked for a menu three times while she retrieved menus and took orders for the people next to us an hour after we came in... thats where I start to have an issue with the service. Eventually we decided to leave because I was tipping over the line to \"hangry\" and was afraid I'd lose my temper after the 3rd time we had asked for menus and didn't get them while she continued to warmly greet other patrons and provide them menus and take their orders while refilling our beers seemed to be an annoyance to her to the point of not even asking if we wanted another or the same beer and just taking the glass and starting to fill it (wherein I had to stop her because I hadn't asked her for another one and actually just wanted the tab cashed out).

Yes, of course I'll give it another try, I want this to be my local hang out bar. My service in sitting at the table or being served by the woman I presume is the owner has been great. The food is amazing. The prices are great. Don't let me down, The Huddle."}
{"text":"I like the double cooked wings, but they're like chick wings they're so mini.  The thing that turns me off the most about this place is they have cardboard disposable bowls for their complimentary popcorn - however they get upset if u try and use it to put wing bones or other things in it because they insist on wiping out & reusing the disposable bowls. Disgusting & totally unsanitary IMO. If they insist on reusing those, imagine where they are cutting corners behind closed kitchen doors. I'd go back for bottled beer, that's about it."}
{"text":"Today must be our servers worst day. It is 8:12 pm and we arrived at 6:00 for dinner only. (In & out) The waitress is super mean & agitated we are afraid to even get her attention for the check...and our entrees are STILL not out. At this point we want to go home & go to bed...but the girls nowhere in site & the table busser doesn't speak English. Ugh..."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to find The Huddle a few years ago when I was residing in Beechview.  I've moved since then but I drive the 15 minutes or so to the Huddle on a regular basis. It is one of my favorite spots to go for drinks with friends, wing night, or a dinner date. I always enjoy taking friends and family there, despite that I selfishly want to keep it a secret.  If too many people started showing up it would lose that delicate balance of remaining just busy enough but never too crowded to have a good time.  The food is always great and the prices are super affordable.  True, the wait staff doesn't have that sense of urgency one appreciates but I consider it part of the laid back, inviting atmosphere that is rare these days."}
{"text":"Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got.
Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot.
Wouldn't you like to get away?

Yea yea- it's nice to go where everybody knows your name, but you know what's even better? A server who knows your drink order and weekly wing order.

Their wings are the best in the city. Now I like a 20 flavor wing sauce list as much as the next guy, but trust that you don't need all of those options. At The Huddle you get 2 sauce choices and you can have those choices wet or tanned. BBQ tanned in my go-to. They slather on that sweet BBQ and then bake it into the wings. The result are wings with crispy, sticky skin and tender, juicy meat. 

The Huddle isn't trying to be fancy or unique. They are serving straight up bar food, but it's pretty good bar food. Also, don't expect 5 star service (but the wings make up for it).

Aside from the wings, I'm a huge fan of their Reuben and their monstrous grilled cheese. Pizza is surprisingly good as well! We usually have a party of 6 on wing night and their pizza is the perfect appetizer to split among the table.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Good food. Reasonable pricing. Wings and rings were my fair my most recent stop here
My friend had a steak which looked and smelled delicious. She confirmed that it was."}
{"text":"Not sure what people see here but it's a never again. I was with a party if 8, appetizers were frozen from a bag, waitress messed up 2 of the orders, steaks came out wrong and she made us pass out drinks to each other.  It was busy but at times couldn't find her. The rest of the wait staff seemed irritated and I had to get another waitress to find ours because she was sitting having a conversation with the table a few down from us.  If you want decent bar find you may as well make yourself a drink and burger at home and call it a night out instead of waisting your time with this place."}
{"text":"The last time I was there was a wing night. I was so disappointed. Bird legs were bigger than the wings. Also if you don't know the waitresses there are rude at times."}
{"text":"The Huddle is foolishly cheap.  It's cash only.  You'll meet a lot of Yinzers here.  It's highly entertaining to sit at the bar and listen to the conversations occurring around you.  The average age is probably 45, but it's well interspersed with younger people, hipsters, and unpretentious people that want a cheap beer.  If you live in the area, and you haven't been here yet, you should definitely swing through.  

Most bottles of beer here are $2.  Don't expect to order any micros, but there's a solid list of macros available.  Buckets are a popular option.  

I've also eaten here, and while I don't remember what I got, I do know that it was cheap, and it was well worth the $6 or so I spent on the meal.  

Last but definitely not least...there's free fresh popcorn in the back.  Boom."}
{"text":"It's past 10pm, we're hungry, coming home from a wedding party that served small portions of non-edible food. We're visitors from the West Coast, know nothing of the area. Yelped for an establishment that is open late, and still serves food within a 2-mile radius from our hotel. Voila! Yelp has sent us to Huddle. Not only did we get some bomb-ass fish and chips, we got stiff drinks for cheap. WOW! I wouldn't mind coming back here just to hang out if we're in town again. Only thing is it's cash only. Good thing we still had some handy."}
