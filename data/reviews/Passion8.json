{"text":"Went to Passion8 for brunch, horrible service. Long wait, we got there at 12:15pm, and didn't get our food till 2pm.  Waitress didn't do anything to ease the wait, said food was coming right out..still waited another 30 minutes. Food was mediocre. Overrated spot."}
{"text":"Mixed. And we had such high hopes. My entree, grilled trout, was quite good. The pearl couscous accompanying it was on the bland side. Husband enjoyed his shrimp and grits, aside from the fact that the portion size was simply tiny. We also ordered beignets for dessert, which were stale, tough, and obviously not prepared that day. Regarding our dining experience in general... we had reservations, and waited almost an hour - we were seated downstairs. Our table, in the middle of the room, was part of an unfortunate layout. I don't typically carry a tape measure in my purse, but our table was probably 18-24 inches wide, tops. The wait staff zipped by on either side of us, to the point where I was clipped twice on the arm. I had to actually spend my lunch with my arms pulled into my lap, so my elbows didn't accidentally protrude into the path of traffic. It might have been a nice fit for a couple of 8 year olds, but not for anyone of normal stature. Granted, our experience might have been more pleasant on a weekday night when the place wasn't hopping, but what can I say? Wait staff was attentive, but nothing out of the ordinary. The bar looked fun, and perhaps the upstairs had more ambience. But for these prices, I expected more. If we do venture back, it won't be on Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and I am definitely a fan. Both experiences had great service and the food was very good. I ordered the pork the first time (excellent) and was not disappointed. The second time I ordered the quail (good but not great). I think the quail was tastefully done, but I won't order again because there was really very little meat on the bird and it was kind of hard to eat. My wife ordered the trout (which looked good) and one of our friend's ordered the filet which I have to say looked AWESOME. I will definitely order the filet next time.

Their dessert list is phenomenal! I highly recommend trying one of the tastefully portioned, delicious desserts if you go. I had the carrot cake and it was really good.

I really like farm-to-table healthy locally owned restaurants like this one. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First time here the atmosphere is Reserved & Romantic, Fresh quality of food, Came for brunch I had the Farmhouse Breakfast is was okay wasn't impress with the eggs which were \"supposed\" to be Scramble, but they were instead wet, overall it was okay."}
{"text":"On our first trip to Passion 8, we began with the infamous calamari which proved to be a great choice. Three adequate entrees later, we requested a dessert to go. We settled on the \"Molten Chocolate Cake\" which failed to satisfy. Cold, lumpy, shapeless, and completely lacking a molten center, a highly anticipated evening ended in disappointment."}
{"text":"Mother of God, this is a wonderful place!!!!

We celebrated our anniversary here tonight, and enjoyed everything immensely!

The house made charcuterie, the consomme, the fig Manhattan... delicious and satisfying.

Looking forward to future great meals here."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 4 and were seated as soon as we arrived (on time) at a very nice table. We had glasses of sparkling wine to celebrate a birthday followed by a bottle of wine. Both were very good. Each of us had the 4 course dinner. A wide variety of items were chosen. First course included the calamari, pork belly and squash blossoms. Second course included the Beet salad, Greek salad and Spring salads. Main courses were the duck breast, pork chop, pasta of the day, and scallops. Desserts were tiramisu, chocolate gelato and apple tarts. Everything was wonderfully delicious. The service was excellent. Definitely going back as often as possible."}
{"text":"If you want to pay $100plus for just above average food and very weird service - you can go here - would not go back - nothing was special"}
{"text":"We seated ourselves in the Bar area for Brunch, the Bartender waited on us, won't say he wasn't friendly but not very helpful with offering answers to our questions. We both ordered the steak and eggs, the place was almost empty so it was puzzling to my girlfriend and I what took so long to bring out our food. I ordered my steak med well, however my steak came in 4 tiny slices and two of them where virtually raw, which made me ill to look at. we had to asked for ketchup, salt and pepper and some toast and that took him some time as well. We where very disappointed to say the least and very disappointed to know that they where advertising free cobbler or Benets with an entre at Brunch, of course that never was offered!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, I want to be proprietrix Jessica's BFF.  From her amazingly talented hubs, Chef Luca, to her world travels and taste in wine, she is the girl to know.  Everything we tasted was beautifully presented and delish.  The atmosphere oozed upscale and even the babies having dinner in the back room were chic.  

The wine is hand selected and pairings are encouraged.  For special events, reserve the Chef's Table with friends or try a blind folded meal.  Great for private events, large groups or an intimate dinner.  

GET THE CALAMARI!"}
{"text":"This is obviously the new darling of the \"in\" crowd and has many good reviews.  However, I found the food to be average at best.  We started with the cheese tray which was actually the best thing we had all night.  I order the brisket and lobster for dinner.  The brisket was VERY fatty; I didn't have a bite that wasn't at least 50% fat.  Not a bit pleasant and the lobster bisque that topped it had very little flavor and could not save the dish.  My husband had the scallops.  They were great but there was almost nothing else on his plate.  We ended with the sour apple dessert which was simply awful.  They soak the apples in \"Pucker\" and the dish was dry, sour, and unpleasant.  So, very mixed experience on the food front.

Service was attentive but pacing was off.  We didn't receive our dinner until almost 40 minutes after finishing up our appetizer.   Overall, we sat down at 7:00 p.m. and left at 9:45...do the math.   

We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We finally got to Passion 8 and we were not disappointed! Only day 5 and they only have a few timing kinks to work out - which they acknowledged. Our experienced compared with a NYC restaurant. Our server Brian described every detail of the menu - and each dish was spot on and yummy! Jessica, the GM and wife of the chef, was so charming and passionate about the restaurant. This is their life and well as a business and you can tell!! The space is large but they have made it feel intimate, quite, warm (which is hard to do) and most importantly beautiful!  Can't wait to go back for chef's table!  Local chefs need to up their game now that Passion 8 is here!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with Passion8's follow up on my poor dining experience."}
{"text":"8 Points of Awesomeness for Passion8

I am glad I waited this long to write a review of Passion8 because my husband and I just had the best experience ever.  This review is more about the people and experience then the food.  Don't get me wrong the food is fabulous! Chef Luca has made my husband a lover of scallops, salmon and beets.  Hard to do.  I have NEVER had a bad or even just okay meal at Passion8.  All the food is amazing.

I have been a fan of this restaurant since they have been in Fort Mill.  There move to Elizabeth Ave. was tough to swallow as it doubled the commute time to get to the restaurant. But it is so worth it.  My husband and I went on Saturday, November 22 for our 11th anniversary.  I went online the night before to make the reservation for 7PM.  No problem.  However, when I did not receive a call by 5:30 on Saturday night (they usually call to confirm your reservation), I called to double check.  Our reservation had not gone through, but the hostess said that they would be happy to accommodate us at 7:15PM, would that be all right?  Absolutely. 1st POINT OF AWESOMENESS FOR PASSION8

We arrived at 7PM and sat at the bar to have our first drink.  Butch was at the bar and he's just an awesome person in conjunction with being a great mixologist.  At one previous visit to Passion* Bistro, he made my 16-year old daughter fun mocktails, which just made her night.  We chatted with Butch, who made reference to our last visit during the first weekend they were opened at the new location. 2nd POINT OF AWESOMENESS FOR PASSION8

We headed over to the hostess stand and they led us to our table, which was upstairs.  I was a bit bummed as the downstairs is so beautiful.  I asked the hostess if we could sit downstairs and she went to check.  She came back and said it as full, BUT she would make a note in the system so next time we made a reservation we would be sat in the downstairs room.  3rd POINT OF AWESOMENESS FOR PASSION8

While I tried to be okay with being upstairs, it was also pretty chilly.  I let our server know that we were going to go back downstairs to have dinner at the bar.  He said no problem and brought our drinks downstairs.  So, we are back with Butch, Charlie and Amanda and enjoyed ourselves immensely.  Reminiscing about our 11 years and 4 children together.  How far we've come from a food standpoint.  From Bennigan's (where we met) to Passion8!

The food.  Oh the food. It is just amazing.  We shared the perfectly seared scallops entrée as the appetizer, followed by the quail for me and pork of the day for my husband.  He was hesitant because it had roasted beets with beet vinaigrette.  We both cleared our plates. 4th & 5th POINT OF AWESOMENESS FOR PASSION8

We enjoyed a few cocktails.  Champagne from Spain, a couple of mojitos and a Pecan Mai Tai.  The Mai Tai was a creation made by Charlie and it was delicious. 6th POINT OF AWESOMENESS FOR PASSION8

Butch came around and placed dessert spoons in front of us even though we didn't order dessert.  We had told them we were celebrating our anniversary and he surprised us with wonderful peppermint bark brioche dessert with beat foam.  7th POINT OF AWESOMENESS FOR PASSION8

We asked for the bill, handed over the credit card and Butch came back with the \"adjusted bill.\"  They had taken care of our drinks and wished us a Happy Anniversary.  8th POINT OF AWESOMENESS FOR PASSION8

They didn't have to do any of what they did.  By accommodating us, not minding that we moved, to the complimentary dessert and cocktails.  I am already a fan. I have already told everyone I know how great this place is.  I've told them I can't wait until they open for lunch because I am coming on Day 1 with 5 other people.

As a restaurant marketer, I know that each of these 8 points of awesomeness for Passion8 makes a difference.  No matter how small.  Each point just made me love them more and be an even more loyal fan.  Thank you to the wonderful hostesses, Calayla (sp? - who was not there last night, but has taken cared of us other times), Butch, Charlie, Amanda, Jessica and Chef Luca."}
{"text":"Great modern venue with an excellent menu selection. The calamari and scallops are to die for!  The calamari  is the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great ambiance , bartender excellent, food versatile menu 
Disher tasty vey small vey small portions
Service good"}
{"text":"It would've been a 4 star if it wasn't for the $42 steak that my husband couldn't even cut. At first, he said it was chewy. Then he was doing nothing but chewing. Then he quietly laid down the silverware and declared that the French onion soup was very good. He's not much of a complainer and I have never seen him send anything back. The waitress came to ask what we wanted for dessert (even though I already told her) and I said his meal wasn't edible. She offered a free dessert. The Rocky Road he ordered turned into the Nutella 3 ways on the way to our table. 
He doesn't eat Nutella.  
This makes him sound terrible picky but he isn't and, if I didn't know him better, I would've never noticed. But after all these years, I know Nutella wore off its allure when our youngest ate it with everything for a period a few years ago. I was glad it was just the two of us and that our new neighbors canceled our dinner plans for the evening because I would've been embarrassed to take them here.

$130 for my meal (sweet potato gnocchi, pork cheeks and a creme brûlée that curiously tastes like actual butter) was good - if a little unctuous - and his soup. 

It's a little too much to need to stop for something to eat on your way home an hour later."}
{"text":"Went there for Father's Day and it was really good. Interesting menu, great service and the best Bloody Mary (Homemade Mix, Beef Jerky Stick, Garnished with Lobster Claw or Shrimp... Yep!!!) We will definitely be back as it seems like a great date night spot or just a cool place to grab a cocktail. Enjoy Friends!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and light.  Well stocked bar.  Food is mostly organic as well as a lot of local providers."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte last week for a work conference and had the pleasure of dining at Passion8. I eat at a variety of restaurants in the DC area, from hole in the wall establishments to some of the finer dining locales, and the meal and wine pairing we had at Passion8 would match up to any of them. I am genuinely having trouble finding anything to dock them points on... the service was fantastic, our appetizers were all surreal (potentially the best calamari I've ever had), and the lamb loin they had on special that night was first class... presentation, taste and texture. We couldn't (and wouldn't) leave without thanking the chef/owner for an unforgettable meal. I plan to return to Charlotte for the sole reason of visiting Passion8 again."}
{"text":"I have to give this one star, but it really deserves zero stars. The service is so piss-poor here, from the manager to the bus boy, that it is screwing up what could be a great new Charlotte restaurant. After a full 45 minutes of being told my food was \"being plated,\" the food was cold, and had clearly been under heat lamps for a good 30 minutes. $160 charged and we ate none of our cold food. This is another disappointing Charlotte restaurant."}
{"text":"We are lover's of Passion 8 from the Fort Mill days, where every dining experience was a delicious 5-star event.  We finally made our way to the Elizabeth Avenue location for Valentine's Day brunch, and the whole experience was disappointing.  The hostess was visibly distressed when relaying the fact that the restaurant was running a half hour behind schedule.  We were seated upstairs, horrible décor.  The couple beside us asked for their bill before they received their food, we should've followed suit,. Service painfully slow, with no courtesy explanation.  First courses of tomato bisque soup with mozzarella for me and fried crepes for my husband were both delicious.  After we completed that course, we waited another 30 minutes for the entrees-shrimp and grits was the worst I have ever had, my husband's eggs benedict was okay, he didn't even finish it.  We waited another 30 minutes for the red velvet beignets, the pastry was tough and bland, saved by the cream cheese filling.  The bar area was full, the dining room upstairs, and below us, was filled to less than half capacity.  Another couple that was seated for about 20 minutes, left the restaurant without ordering.  We will make another reservation on a non-holiday evening, I will ask specifically if Luca is in the kitchen prior to booking, and also request seating downstairs.  Such a dramatic decrease in food quality and service is hard for us to believe. We spent over $11 on 2 cups of coffee while we waited for our late seating, and $70 for this lack-luster meal without complaint-hoping it is an anomaly.  The delightful meals we've enjoyed from Passion 8 in the past are so memorable, that we are definitely willing to gamble another couple of hundred dollars another evening, before we decide not to waste our time and money here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst meal I've ever had in Charlotte!! Entrance: Beautiful.  Hostess: Very friendly. Atmosphere: Very urban and well planned. Food: If I could give no stars, I would!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing New Years Eve dinner. After all the hype about the Fort Mill location, i was eager to try. Food, the little bit you got was mediocre and the dessert was hard as a rock. Definitely not worth the price tag. Our waiter acted very annoyed in general and did not help to make the experience any better. I will not be going back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Giving it four stars for now because I have not been here for dinner only brunch.
The selection is minimal but quite the variety and curated for brunch lovers.
Really enjoy the place and hope to get back for a dinner one night."}
{"text":"Just awesome. Had the infamous calamari, the squab, and the spice cake for desert.  Definitely would do again!"}
{"text":"We had reservations for 12:45, and were seated almost an hour later. 
Service from the beginning was terrible. Food was average, some in our party thought it was good others did not. 
Given the high price point, this restaurant does not meet standards. 
Definitely pass on this for all the other better options nearby."}
{"text":"It's about time good taste found its rightful place from Fort Mill to Elizabeth Ave. For ages, I meant to try Passion8 Bistro in Fort Mill, but anytime we had the time to go, it was on a Sunday (on which they were closed). It must have heard me complaining and decided to come to me. :)

The stud decided to take me out to dinner Saturday and it was a last minute deal, so we sat in the large bar area at a high top. The space is quite large with the bar separated from the main dining room with a peekaboo architectural wall and a terrace of tables upstairs. The crowd is lively but more mature than the uptown crowd, so think 5Church but grown up. They have some unique cocktails that are quite boozy. I tried one with a pecan orgeat and rum, and hubs had a rye and apple cider cocktail with lavender that was lovely and perfect for fall. 

The food concept is farm to table, and the menu changes regularly. We started with the butternut squash with walnut oil and fried sage.  Then I had the second course of clams. You don't often see just clams on a menu around here, mainly because mussels tend to be more flavorful. The flavor profile was wonderful- the clams were paired with a smooth arugula pesto, apples and pecans with savory white wine foam and some crispy kale on top. I don't know how they get so much flavor in that foam! 

Hubs had the braised short ribs with ginger braise over mashed potatoes. The short ribs were the most tender he (or I) had ever tasted. It was pretty incredible. The mash was fine, but nothing amazing. We should note, he also ate all of the small, savory rolls because they were so delicious. 

I'd echo what Chris H said about the servers- they were all incredibly knowledgable, and apparently had all tried the menu. it's my pet peeve when you ask about a dish and they hadn't tried it. Our server, Amanda, was up there as one of the best servers we'd ever had. Even the guy that brought us utensils was amazingly friendly and informed. Jessica came over and talked with us like we were old regulars. She informed us that they will be open Sundays for brunch in December, along with lunch service.

Bottom line: Amazing service, inventive flavorful menu, great interior = one of our new favorite spots. 

PS, I don't care if it's trendy, the term \"fluid gel\" should never, ever, ever grace a menu. It's both unappetizing and pretentious."}
{"text":"Had a great time. First time at this location. Server was very knowledgable and helpful. Chef was willing to tailor to dietary needs. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything I ate was fantastic!  I got to sleek with the owner and chef.  He's very passion-8 about his food and service, and it shows!  I'll be back"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Passion8 for a while now, so we decided to give it a shot for our Valentine's Day dinner. We were a bit hesitant, knowing the chaos that comes with the holiday,  but figured a restaurant of this caliber would be able to handle it. 

We were seated about 30 minutes after our reservation time, not a problem, we then waited about 5 minutes for the waitress who's first words were \"we're out of filet\". We then got our escargot, which was luke warm and bland. 30 minutes later we had to flag down the server to see were our 1st course was ( my scallops were good, the soup... ehhh ) 45 minutes later, we were approached by the couple next to us who had noticed how long we we had been waiting; turns out they had the same reso time as us, had already finished their meal, and were out the door before we even had our entrees. 

To make a long story short, the service was terrible and the food was nothing to write home about. We decided to speak  to the manager, who told us she would take care of us, but we were then disappointed to find we had only been comped 2 glasses of house wine. 

$160 would have been better spent  Showmars."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a very nice meal here. The ambiance is a bit dark and romantic. When we were first seated (with a reservation), we were given a small two-top table. Then I saw another couple seated after us at a four top and so asked our server if we could move to a larger table to make it easier for us to share our dishes. After a moment, she asked if we minded moving to the back dining room. We said of course not, and the back dining room was at least as nice as the front. So we were happy and appreciated them moving us with no issue.

The food and serve from there was all very good. My wife had the pasta with chorizo. Pasta was home made and the chorizo was not too spicy for her taste. It was also more than enough food, and I had to suck it up and help her finish.

I had the fresh-caught North Carolina amberjack, which was rich and meaty. It was almost as good as real meat. I don't order fish often because it can leave me feeling unsatisfied, but this dish was more than enough for me.

So, we had a lovely experience here at Passion8. My only reservation about going back is that some of the pricing was a bit surprising, like $26 for pasta, $13 for a Manhattan, and $9 for after dinner coffee and limoncello. I would not have even noticed if I was in San Francisco, Chicago, or New York; I guess I just don't think of Charlotte as on a par with those cities. 

But for a romantic meal with your special someone, I think this place is right on."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an excellent meal at Passion8 on Friday, 7/15. The service was fantastic as well. I ordered the composed market vegetable plate and my husband ordered the house made pasta. The vegetable plate consisted of risotto with fresh, local vegetables. The house made pasta was in a tomato sauce with sausage and eggplant. Both dishes (but especially the vegetable plate) had beautiful presentation. 

I think it says a lot about a chef when you can create an excellent, unique, and flavorful vegetable plate for an entree. I am primarily vegetarian, and this was the best vegetable plate I have ever had at a restaurant. My last visit to Passion8 was in the Fall, and I also ordered the vegetable plate and it was just as incredible. My husband also enjoyed the pasta - I had a taste of the pasta with the tomato sauce and it was delicious.  

We were celebrating my birthday, and the server brought out two complimentary glasses of champagne at the end of the meal. Overall, a great experience and wonderful food; can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in this restaurant! The service is just awful! 
We came on Valentines Day, which in my opinion, is the day everyone in the restaurant should have their act together!
-Our waitress was incredibly rude! Every question we asked seemed to annoy her. For example, after waiting a very long time to get our drinks or food order in, we asked for bread, and irritated, she said \"we don't have bread service tonight!\" What kind of restaurant, especially of this caliber does NOT offer bread!? This was definitely a first for us!
Then, our waitress took our order, I ordered the \"surf and turf\" on the \"pre-fix menu\", and didn't bother to ask how I wanted my filet cooked. When I asked her for medium-well, again seemed annoyed, and said \"she was going to see where they were in the process!\" Sure enough, my entree came and my steak was too rare for my liking. My husband ended up eating most of it. To top that off, the food was luke-warm!
I will not be returning to this restaurant, especially when there are way better options within a few feet away!"}
{"text":"Valentines that's when you dumb down the menu, correct.. then you still wait for 45 minutes for tuna tartar and escargot then will comment when food comes. Continuing on horrible  appetizer over limed tuna, escargot covered in gravy like the seventies.im miserable here 2hrs 45 mins still no entree. Please help my miserable night. I'm miserable on hour 3."}
{"text":"I was able to visit the newly relocated Passion8 in its beautiful new setting in Elizabeth.  Wow.  Truly amazing.  The décor is simply beautiful and the food was just as amazing as in past visits to their old location.  What was even more surprising was how well the staff, the far majority of which must be new, really knew their product.  They were passionate about the experience we had as guests and yet they weren't intrusive.  They worked so well as a team serving and clearing our table that you would have thought they've all been working together for years.  This is SO hard to find in a new restaurant so we were impressed.

The new menu is a great presentation of what is currently fresh and current.  And they didn't forget to include an old favorite, the calamari cubano which redefines calamari for people like me that won't even order calamari elsewhere.  The unique approach to \"surf and turf\" that included a rare cut of meat with lobster roe was so creative and SO good.  Oh and the pork belly and fresh fish dishes were fantastic.  (Have your server explain how they do the pork belly!)

I can't wait to visit again this week with my husband who had to miss out on the opening weekend!"}
{"text":"I would give them 8 Stars if I could.

The fear that the new location would hurt their food is not necessary. Essentially the great food has found a great home in a new and more contemporary setting. 

Great place. Had the fish of the day last time - cooked to perfection with a light Center all accompanied  by a nice glass all that with dedicated service. Can hardly get any better."}
{"text":"Positives: Decor was very modern and sleek, Service was generally good, Hostess was accommodating and easy to converse with..Drinks excellent. Foie Gras superb! Pork Bun app equally tasteful...

Cons: Wine is stored in wall cabinets in back dining room so they are not temperature controlled meaning that they taste sour. Had a sample of almost all house reds and each one was spoiled...Steak ok..For $42 should of melted in my mouth, but I've had worse.

 Now im from a city where excellent culinary standards are the norm so maybe im being a tad bit critical but I expect when spending  $150 for 2 that it equals the price of admission..

Recommendation: Apps and drinks with friends..Its fun atmosphere!
Skip full course and wine until they install proper wine storage as pairing fine food is key for me..."}
{"text":"We decided to try out Passion8 for restaurant week after multiple recommendations from a friend. Once we sat down and took a look at the menu, we decided to deviate from the Queen's Feast as we were much more interested in the regular menu. 
We decided to start with the calamari and mussels with lamb belly, followed by the scallop and steak entrees, and asked for the cheese plate for dessert. 
Our drinks were brought out timely, and we told the server our full order at once so that he could pace the meal for us. 
We were there for 2 hours, but not by any choice of ours. 
I really wish I had timed things, because I know that waiting always feels longer than it actually is. Since I didn't, I'll have to estimate that between drinks and appetizers, appetizers and entrees, then entrees and the cheese, we waited about 20 minutes each time. Mind you, that's 20 minutes after having finished the previous course/bread. Our server was attentive. We were not running him. Although it was restaurant week, it was also a snow day, and the restaurant was at about 50% capacity when we got there for our 7:45 reservation. So I'll take a star for the timing. 
The second star related to the food itself. You're paying for portion here. If I wanted to pay for portion, I'd go to a buffet. We were looking more for quality. The mussels were alright; I wish there had been a bit more lamb belly. The calamari was good. The scallops were cooked well, but were salty. The steak was huge, but tough and lacking in flavor. No matter which way I cut it, I couldn't find a sweet spot on that steak. The cheese plate was interesting, and had some elk mousse, which was cool. We paid $200 for the two of us after tax and tip with a couple drinks. 
The staff is great, but the back of house and management seem like they have some work to do in the communication department. 
As we were eating our entrees, we heard someone fussing at a table behind us about keeping their opinions to themselves as to not ruin his reputation. He stormed off to the kitchen after a sarcastic thanks and goodnight, leaving his patrons wondering who he was and what had just happened. Not sure what was going in there, but it was awkward. I guess that's where they get the name Passion8?"}
{"text":"Failed all around. I hate being a negative critic but this restaurant failed in many ways last night. 
-Waitress wasn't trained. I had to ask if there were any specials and the answer was yes Mahi Mahi.  If you're waiting for something else you won't get it. I guess it was just a slab of fish and nothing more. 

-We ordered a main course and was told they no longer have it (if I spend 10 minutes picking out my meal it'd be nice to know that upfront). There were only 6-7 choices not sure how you're out of one.

-I wrote on the online reservation from their site that it was my wife's birthday.  I wasn't a surprise when they didn't acknowledge that. 

-They have some excellent drinks but I did ask that they make one a little less sweet. The waitress came back and said they can't do it...really bartender you can't make it less sweet.  Less simple sugar and more bourbon perhaps. 

-The folks next to us came later and were servers prior to us

-The pork chop was raw in parts. Not under cooked, raw. 

-Lastly the portions are all over the place.  The scallop dish literally only took up 1/4 of the plate. The pork chop however literally fell over the plate it was so massive. I can't even do it justice. I've never witnessed that much pork in my life. We took it home after both of eating it and there's still enough for 2 meals. 

For a $125 meal I should've"}
{"text":"The space and decor are not intimate and feel large and impersonal. The food is good but pricey for what it is. It is not an innovative menu. Passion 8 does not compare in overall experience to Carpe Diem or Custom Shop, both right next door."}
{"text":"Jekyll and hyde!  Last night was the worst service, food and experience I have EVER had at a high end restaurant.  Very sad"}
{"text":"Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 10 STARS! Well OK 5 because Yelp is limiting me! LOL..

Well this is my first time back at Passion8 since they moved to this new Elizabeth street location, and WOW is this a HUGE improvement over the old Fort Mill setting......like night and day! This place is open, very modern yet cozy and romantic. The first thing you notice is the really cool \"hipster\" bar. Not huge but I had the pleasure of having a drink here last week after my dinner at Carpe Diem next door. They have 3 large dining areas, 2 on the first floor and a nice Mezannine area. Dimly lit but you don't need to use your Smartphone camera lights, so A+ on Ambience IMHO.

Went here with my friend Melanie for Restaurant Week. As you've read me say like a broken record, Restaurants can be hit and miss during these frenzied times, but I've been lucky this week with now my FOURTH RW meal. And it looks like I saved the best for last! Oh where do I start....

Like 3 courses wasn't enough....I have recently discovered (thanks to my buddy Chef Josh from Johnson & Wales U) how good Calamari can be, and Passion8 delivered a GREAT dish of Calamari with Jalapeno and Honey Citrus Butter. This was a great balance of \"sweet heat\" and it was really delicious....but this was just the beginning of what was to become a phenomenal meal!

How about the appetizers, Course #1. Melanie got the Scallop with smoked onion, \"Foie Mousse\" (like a slight Foie Gras flavor in a white mousse setting), roasted brussel sprouts and arugula. Scallop was cooked to perfection, and that Foie Mousse was unique as I've never had anything quite like that before. It was sublime! I got the Cauliflower soup with pickled onions, walnuts and carmelized cauliflower. This soup was borderline ridiculous (in a very good way). It was so good it should be illegal. Subtle hints of butter and cream, but not at all overpowering or \"in your face.\" This soup was all about restraint and subtlety, and it simply was fantastic!

Course #2. Melanie had NC Fresh Catch of the day, which was an Amber Jack (a meaty whitefish) over risotto, baby carrots and \"tea fish veloute\" sauce. Now THIS was a serious fish dish, as all the flavors harmonized perfectly. I got the Braised Beef served with a Mushroom Ragu, purple potato, broccoil with a truffle demi sauce. WOW was this ever phenomenal! Take a look at the picture...they gave me THREE good sized pieces of beef, and it all \"melted in your mouth.\" I had the Braised Beef at Georges during this RW, and while Georges also was superb, this was as good but more than twice the amount of beef! No skimping here! Just an incredible flavor profile on every component.

Dessert. My buddy Melanie does NOT like sweet desserts, so our waiter Kevin recommended the cherry panna cotta with pecans, vanilla cream, Amarena cherry and a dusting of dark chocolate around the plate. Well this dessert was not at all too sweet, and as with everything we had this night, the subtlety was the star. In fact, my \"I don't do dessert\" friend snarfed down the entire dessert! LOL....I opted for the Walnut Tart with Apricot cream, maple syrup and orange sugar. Our waiter said it was like a \"pecan pie.\" Well that is where he was wrong! This was NOTHING like a traditional Southern pecan pie (in my opinion). This was FAR better, again, the pasty chef showing a great restraint in the use of sugar because while this dish certainly was sweet, it wasn't an \"in your face\" sweetness at all. It was about as \"restrained\" as a tart could be. And I loved it! I suffer from heartburn when eating things too sweet, and I didn't feel a thing when I snarfed down this bad boy. 

Our waiter Kevin (also a Chicagoan - yeay!) was super friendly, professional, courteous, prompt and attentive. What more could you want?

The piece de resistance was when Chef Luca came out to say hello! He was obviously a busy man yet took the time to talk to some of his patrons. I told him how much I loved the Fort Mill location and how I thought the food now was an improvement. He said in his lovely Italian accent, \"Gratzi, but we're working to make it as good as the old location!\" I thought to myself, WHAT? This food was SUPERB in every way, and HE thinks it could be better? Holy %&!(@#$. I can't imagine it being THAT much better! But I sure can't wait to come back and try his \"regular\" menu.

I did bring a bottle of Belle Glos Clark and Telegraph Pinot Noir, which was delicous! The only \"glitch\" of the night was that they charged me $30 for the corkage fee but when I called in the lady said it was only $20. But when I brought this to our waiter's attention, he promptly took care of this and did charge me $20 to which I agreed to. So they showed that the Customer is valued and I surely appreciated that!

Folks, this is surely one of Charlotte's BEST restaurants in every way. I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Passion8! You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is a tough one. The food is elegantly plated, and the service was very friendly. The ambience is nice and the selection is unique. However, since it is on the same street with several other excellent upscale restaurants, it's hard not to compare Passion8 to them. 

My entree, a mahi mahi, was just on the bland side. I usually don't ever season my food, though in this case I felt salt and pepper were necessary. The appetizer, infamous calamari, was exactly as the server described, and was indeed delicious. 

The drink section is good, I had a classic whiskey sour (with egg white) that had a bacon-salt rim. The drink was good, though a tad fancy for my everyday consumption. 

It was a Friday night, and it wasn't that busy, though service was somehow slow. Would try Passion8 again, but perhaps for one of the nights that had food or drink specials."}
{"text":"Went for New Years Eve. Very underwhelming. Left hungry. People drink alcohol on New Year's Eve...and not having bread/crackers or something available is ridiculous. Especially when the first course is one oyster on a plate with some sauce and a radish. Also, if you want coffee, you'll need to order an entire French Press...enough for two. Not flexible.
Not sure about the regular menu, but would not recommend for special occasions until they figure out a few things."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of the Fort Mill location and was thrilled to see that Passion8 was moving into the city where it could truly get the exposure it deserves!  While I was excited for them, I was also a bit nervous about whether they would be able to re-create the dining experience that they had in the old location.  While the new Passion8 is a different experience from the old one, it is exceptional and it is now right up there with any restaurant you will find in Charlotte!

We stopped in for Sunday brunch.  This is a new thing for the Passion8 folks and we were excited to try it out.  The atmosphere - while very different from the former location - is charming with high open ceilings, good lighting, and terrariums on the tables.  There was a Bloody Mary bar with basically everything you could ever want to put in a drink.  The brunch menu included some unique takes on classic brunch dishes.  Chef Luca is a culinary artist who has worked all over Europe, and you can see the various influences in his dishes.  The  attention to detail is evident in the presentation.  I got the root vegetable flat bread with goat cheese, cooked nicely with a crispy crust.  I also got to taste some tender brisket and cheese grits.  The service was good, our waiter was attentive without being obtrusive and was well-versed in the menu options.  

We have eaten dinner at the old location several times and have always been amazed with the quality of the farm-to-table selections.  Now that there is brunch as well, there is really no reason to miss out on this place.  I am so glad that Passion8 has arrived in the city!  Folks, if you are looking for a nice dining experience in Charlotte, this is THE spot."}
{"text":"Great food- even better service!
My husband and I ate here last weekend and both really enjoyed it.  Kevin was our server and wow- he could not have done a better job.  He was very friendly and knew the menu front to back, every ingredient and where every ingredient came from. 
We split the calamari as a starter (which it seems every table around us did too).  $16 is a little steep, but there is a lot of calamari (really more than is needed for 2 people- would be perfect for 4- but we still ate it all!).  The sauce is sweet and spicy, the batter was perfect- not too heavy and the calamari was fresh and not chewy at all. 
I had the braised pork- it was fall off the bone and delicious.  My husband had the rabbit and carrot ravioli.  He said it was good but not amazing, also not a huge portion.  
All in all, we would definitely go back.  The bar also looks like a cool place just to grab a drink (and perhaps split a calamari app)."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in Charlotte since Bently's maybe.  They really get the most out of a small space.
  We went for restuarant week (just a warning this place is probably over $100 a couple, I would consider that $$$$).  I got the pork belly.  This is usually super boring and honestly I wish all restaurants would be move on from 2000 and stop serving this but I was excited about the pickled quail egg it came with.  That was good along with the rest of the picked veggies it came with.  However, I was pretty shocked with the pork.  It was actually good.  Pork belly is an inherantly fatty piece of meat and most chefs seem to go as far as to pick the fattiest ones.  In this pork belly I could actually taste the pork.  The star ended up being the gravy though.  Somehow he made a brown, buttery gravy that was really light. I'm going to experiment with this, my best guess is that he really heavily whisks the gravy seconds before it is served.  My wife had a plate of different tomatos with the panini a perfect combo of tomato and  cheese.
  For the maid course I got the chicken surf and turf.  The chicken was very good, great sauce again with pickled veggies.  It reminded me of the appetizer with a different main meet.  The turf part, eh. It has basically a hush puppie with shrimp paste.  I'm not a fan of seafood pastes.  I wish they had used big pieces of shrimp.  The wife went with the halibut.  I liked the addition of mashed potatos in a cooked cabbage leaf, interesting.
  The desserts weren't particularl inventive but both on the upper end of the typical desserts you get at these places.  Overall, this place is amazing."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times for different experiences. Have met folks to just grab a cocktail and eat at the bar, have done the chef's table (definitely a splurge but gather your best foodie friends and make a reservation for this ) and also restaurant week. All three times have been great. The new location on Elizabeth is quite different than the spot down in Fort Mill.  This review is for restaurant week. Like most participating restaurants, you get a teaser for their full menu. For the appetizer, I had the sweet potato gnocchi. Well portioned and was very tasteful. For the entree I choose the braised pork cheek. Again, well portioned and very tender. The fried leeks were interestingly different and tasty. For dessert, I had the brownie with Nutella. YUM!!  The co-owner Jessica and her husband Chef Luca do a phenomenal job. Loved that she remembered me by name----I haven't been there that much, but that's a nice touch. While service was a bit slower than normal, they were busy and everything was great. Even had one of my favorite bottles of wine-The Prisoner.  If you haven't been, GO!  Support local! Expect top notch service and a delightful dining experience. 
They also have local beers, a nice selection of specialty cocktails, a good win list & a bar menu."}
{"text":"martini was fabulous.  calamari is awesome and generous for 4 people.  while mosy of the dishes we had we tasty, i thought the prices were high for what we had.  dont expect traditional shrimp and grits.  i have no idea what kind of grits those were. scallops were excellent but there were ony 4.  chocolate dessert is very good. and the french press coffee is plenty for 2 people.  fresh biscotti was a bonus.  service was excellent"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving dinner was tops! Appetizers were done well. A prix fixe menu, we ordered the turkey and trout. They served ALL OF THE SIDES. Drinks from the bar were delicious; we had a great time. Great service."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had reservations made through the Open table app. at 7:30 pm, arrived on time and were seated somewhat quickly. We sat at our table until 7:55pm and we were never approached or acknowledged . I have no idea how the food tastes because we decided to leave. Upon leaving we did get the standard \"thank you, have a nice night\" from a group of ladies who were standing by the bar, (not sure what their job titles were). My fiancé did advise the hostess before leaving the reason why we decided to leave. And they seemed shocked but definitely didn't make any attempt to stop us. The restaurant took it upon themselves to cancel our reservation that we're made through Open Table, perhaps to prevent us from getting an email from them requesting a review of the restaurant. Needless to say as far as experiences go, this was NO experience at all. We will not be back to patronize this establishment. We went to bistro labon with no reservations ,were seated and treated kindly. The food at bistro labon was excellent! Thanks passion 8 for driving us towards a better experience at bistro labon!!!"}
{"text":"The fella and I live near the Fort Mill location, but we're so glad they moved to Charlotte! There's so much more room at this location, and now I can actually see the menu.

We arrived 30 minutes before our Open Table reservation to have a drink at the bar, which is long and spacious and seats about 12 people; there were also a couple of high-top tables near the front window. They had all local beers on tap, but I started with the bartender's recommendation of a Fig Manhattan (cold, bourbon-y, and yummy), and the fella went straight for a Blanton's neat. Bless the bartender's heart, you could hardly see the bourbon in his glass since the pour was so tiny... the fella was not impressed and grumbled a little bit through the beginning of dinner. 

We moved onto the dining room behind the bar (there's also another one to the side of the bar), and it turns out they can curtain off any of the rooms for private parties. There's also another room upstairs for that specific reason, and there's a glassed-off chef's table that looks into the kitchen and appeared to seat about 10 people. The atmosphere of the entire restaurant/bar is dark and cozy with warm lighting and dark brown wood - perfect for a winter night. Although the atmosphere is intimate and upscale, we still felt totally comfortable in jeans, which I appreciate.

Our waitress, Esther, was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and had definite recommendations when we'd need a judge's ruling. We started with the pork belly (delicious), and then I got the pork of the day as my entree, and the fella got the short ribs. Thankfully, the chef prepared my pork medium rare, so it was incredibly tender, but I think the fella may have won the night since his short ribs were delicious, and his mashed potatoes were \"like crack.\"

The staff was full of nervous excitement and chattiness, and I'm guessing that'll calm down a little once they hit a groove, but I appreciated the enthusiasm... now they just need to work on their pours. Overall, a great addition to the Elizabeth food scene!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! SO excellent! I am happy/sad: happy because each dish was delicious to-the-max and beautifully presented; sad to let each plate go cause I want to keep eating! Seasonal vegetables, foie gras, scallops, passion fruit/chocolate dessert. Oh gosh! So truly amazing! Service by Esther was extraordinary! She is a lovely representative for the restaurant, knows food, passionately describes each dish and how it's prepared, is great at giving guidance. I cannot wait to come back to Passion8 on my next trip to wonderful foodie Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Super pumped to try Passion8 for Sunday brunch last week; a farewell brunch for Dan C with some fellow Yelpers. 
The atmosphere is warm and dark - great for a rainy day. The wall in the main dining room could use some artwork = kind of a blank canvas now.
Our server Charlie, was excellent - he knew the menu backwards and forwards and made great suggestions.
The French Press coffee was dark and strong - I felt like I'd been drinking! It will make your head swirl...
The Lobster Slaw Benedict was very good - the eggs were poached perfectly with extensive tender claw meat underneath. There was one ingredient toward the bottom that was a bit salty (the rosti maybe?) but overall a successful dish.
At noon the Bloody Mary Bar opens and the Mimosa start to flow. There was some live music that managed to stay in the background and not overwhelm conversations.
A very nice brunch with great company. Really good, low key, handcrafted Farm to Table food!!"}
{"text":"I came to Passion8 last year for a Thanksgiving meal, and I had a great time. From the moment we walked through the door, my wife and I were impressed. The service was great, the environment was stylish and welcoming, and the drinks were incredible. I got a special Bloody Mary with an entire lobster claw in it. It was magical. The food was also impressive: your choice of three appetizers, your choice of three entrees, a platter of side dishes to share, and then a dessert sampler platter. Our server was very attentive, explained all of the dishes, was prompt with refills and drink orders, and boxed up our leftovers. It was a great experience, and I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars. 

It was enough to bring us back for Thanksgiving again this year. Our experience was completely different, however. From the moment we walked in, everything felt off. The hostess was generally clueless - despite us having reservations - and wandered around for a good five minutes \"to find another menu\" before seating us in the upper area, which is dark and dungeon-esque. Once we were seated, we got a bird's eye view of the disaster of the main dining room; everything was out of sorts, and one staff member was working hard to clean up and vacuum a good percentage of the main dining area. Chaos.

Our waitress greeted us promptly, but everything else was at a snail's pace. There wasn't any kind of drink special like last year, and I was pretty bummed about that. The drinks we did order were good, however. I ordered a beer for my second round, and she forgot about it for so long that she ended up taking it  off our tab. I was grateful for that. Water refill (singular) happened only once. 

The waitress (along with any other servers) didn't explain any of the dishes as she gave us the menus or as she served the food, which was fair at best. The shrimp and grits were really disappointing, and the turkey was very moist but very flavorless. Most of the side dishes were good, but we were never offered any extras like we were last year (or like our server offered the tables around us). The desserts were hit or miss, and we saw a lot of other people leave theirs behind. I don't blame them. 

I really expected more from this restaurant. One thing I can say for sure is that, should my wife and I choose to go out to eat for Thanksgiving next year, we will be going somewhere else. We won't be back any other time of the year, either."}
{"text":"The misses and myself came here from out of town and their brunch. The presentation of the food was awesome and the food is quite tasty with a great decor. The thing that really stopped a 5 star review  for me, it's dimly lit for a breakfast ot brunch hour."}
{"text":"This was so good! We came during Queens week and had a fabulous meal- the octopus and potato appetizer was excellent. The snapper was so delicious and light and my cherry panna cotta. Our waitress was excellent and we really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week. I get it it, it's busy for everyone. That is not an excuse for poor service and neglect when being waited on."}
{"text":"I've heard so many mixed reviews about this place and all I can confirm are the good ones.  We went to dinner here prior to a play and they were very polite and accommodating our time constraint.

The decor is dark and warm and a good date spot for dinner all around.  The food was equally impressive as well as the beer and cocktail selection.  I really enjoyed the bar area and the layout.  It is a bit narrow but as long as it doesn't get overcrowded it would be the preferred spot to eat I think.

Parking is all street side."}
{"text":"First time here. Calamari was spicy but very well prepared. I had the scallops with side risotto and although scallop position was small, taste was spot on. Wife had pork medallions. Pork was very tender and taste was great. Desert was the sweet biscuit and we both found it to be dry and tasteless. Overall, we'd go back. It was a little pricey as well."}
{"text":"Great new place a friend introduced me too, in a great location. Not downtown - so you can park easily. Walking distance to other places for night cap, etc... but this place has everything.
Met the owner and she was delightful. She recommended the foie gras which I usually wouldn't get but I took her recommendation - not sorry I did that. It was seared to a very subtle crunch on the outside while warm and tender in the middle - not mushy. Best I've had, ever. 
Also ordered the lamb and fish of the day.
Lamb was cooked perfectly and was extremely tender for a grilled lamb steak. Not easy to do.
Fish was a red snapper but it changes daily - either way, cooked perfectly. The plating is divine and the service is top notch - although the hostess got a bit haughty when we asked not to sit in the middle at a small table. I guess it was late - I'm over it :)
Moody/Romantic atmosphere with low lighting and subtle decor. 
Get there and check it out. I hear the wait can be long so make a reservation or go late."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! The food was very good, but not extraordinary. The service however was very good. I realize it was Restaurant Week , but the upstairs location we were seated in was absolutely abominable . Dark color void of any decor, plain wood tables , and carpet tile flooring . It had the aura of a local fire hall or American Legion in the sixties. No matter how good food is, if the ambience isn't there , the restaurant just doesn't make it. And that's the problem with passion 8.  on leaving I checked out the dining area and bar downstairs and it wasn't much better . Crowded and more carpet tiles . Next time will go back to our old go to on the corner which has very good food, great service and great ambience"}
{"text":"Came here for Queen's Feast when I first moved to Charlotte. It was good, but what's up with expensive places giving you tiny portions? We're not in Europe. It's Amurica."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot about Passion8 we decided to give it a try and we are so glad we did. I love the farm to table or farm to fork aspect as they refer to it. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was impeccable.  The menu definitely has a rustic vibe to it but the decor is more sleek, modern NY feel to it.  My husband and I shared the charcuterie plate and the jalapeno honey citrus butter calamari which was AMAZING. We could have eaten the whole thing but decided to take the rest home. Next we had the cauliflower soup which was really decadent and smooth. I had the scallops and my husband had the brazed pork shank. Everything from start to finish tasted as good as it looked. It's nice to a restaurant of this caliber in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ok, I've only been once, but I was very impressed.

I really liked the chill decor, the nice bartenders and the interesting food.

We got the 5 bar bites and they were good.  I don't usually like pate, but theirs is really good.  The beet tartare was interesting and I enjoyed the smoked salmon.  My least favorite were the pork and then the beef.

They have a white port gin and tonic, which was good and it's nice to see creative drinks.  

I look forward to going again and making some new taste discoveries!"}
{"text":"There are still some kinks to be worked out in the new location  An 8:45 reservation shouldn't mean that we have to wait for a table until 9:30.  

Compared to the old location the interior is a little more \"sterile.\"  Some more draperies to hide the high ceilings and lower noise might help.

The calamari is still absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"Chef cooking at its best. Super attentive staff. Fresh fresh food. You get what you pay for here. I can't afford to go often but it's a treat"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Passion8 for a special date night and loved it. The restaurant is in a really cute area of Charlotte making me wish we had more time before and after dinner to stroll around. Every course was excellent, from the pork belly and BBQ beans, to the asparagus soup and stuffed quail, not to mention the wonderful desert sampling. Chef Luca creates truly delectable dishes from that day's visit to the farmers market. The staff were attentive and the ambiance was a nice combination of trendy and intimate."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on Sunday and thought it was one of the best brunches I've had in quite a while! First off, the French press they serve is incredibly smooth and delicious! It's served with a subtly sweet and fresh biscotti. Great for dunking! Many others were ordering the caramel filled beignets but we did not indulge, instead saving our appetite for the pork eggs Benny with 2 different styles of pork (pulled and pork belly). It was truly magical. The perfect portion! The fig slaw was the perfect slightly sweet accompaniment to the salty pork. I also loved seeing some of our favorite servers from the now closed Lulu's! 

This was a great experience and I would come back to order the pork Benedict again! Someone order the pecan bacon French toast and report back? K thx!"}
{"text":"Passion8 has been on my Charlotte \"Bucket List\" for a couple of years, and during this round of Queen's Feast I decided I had waited long enough. The 3-course dinner (with wine pairing!) was easily one of the best meals I've had in Charlotte, and I know I'll be back to Passion8 when it's time to #treatyoself in the future. 

Our party (of 5) arrived a little early and ordered a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. The interior is beautiful--a little moody with an understated elegance. The bartender was patient with us as we inspected the cocktail menu, and the drinks were great.

Once we were seated, each of us opted for the restaurant week menu plus wine pairing. My picks were stuffed calamari, chicken surf-n-turf, tiramisu. Impeccable plating and presentation, with incredible flavors. Everything was top-notch, and Passion8 is definitely on my short-list for special occasions going forward."}
{"text":"I had heard rave reviews of this place ever since I first moved to Charlotte, and more recently, read about Chef Luca when he competed in Fire in the City cooking competition.  Before entering, I made sure my shoes were tied tight - for fear of getting my socks knocked off!  Well, socks weren't knocked off... in fact, I felt like a teenager sneaking into a strip club mid-day, only to be disappointed by the JV squad.  Okay, that's a little harsh but you get the picture (or I can send them to you...)

One thing that Chef does extremely well is plating.  Everyone's brunch dishes came out looking absolutely tantalizing.  When Michael N's benedict came out, I immediately regretted ordering my basic, boring toast and eggs.  However, when my dish arrived, I immediately dis-regretted ordering it.  But then, I re-regretted it when Moses S's flatbread came out.  Check out their pics and you'll see that I'm not mis-regretting.  My toast and eggs were fine, but not special... I suck at ordering brunch items not named Bloody Mary.

What legit-drags this place down for me is the brunch ambiance.  It was a tad dark and there was live music.  DARKNESS! I can tolerate.  Live music at brunch is absurd and makes no sense.  Brunch has traditionally been for: (a) getting over a hangover; or (b) catching up with friends.  Neither goes particularly well with live music.  Hostesses and Charlie, our server, were genuinely nice and helpful.  Hold onto them tight, P8!

Glad I came... wish I ordered better... but likely won't be headed back.

dmo out."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to that area for a while because of all the road work and construction. So I never saw Passion8 there. But man am I glad I went to have brunch with a group of great fellow Yelpers Tonya, Mike, and John. In short, the place was my type.

The minute I walked in I was greeted with a warm smile. You know, the one that's cordial. Not the fake ones with a very high note \"hello!\" After I was directed to the right table, which was behind that purplish curtain, I immediately bonded with the place. I liked it. The high ceiling. Minimal interior decor. Low lighting with apotlights here and there. Brick walls. And hey, I even see a band getting ready for a live jam. 

Now, some might feel like it was a bit dark for a brunch. I get ya. But it's also preference. If I'm. Ot working and out to eat my technicaaly first meal of the day at 11, then I'm not the most awake man in the world and I want to stay that way. So for me it was perfect. Even the wall being empty was good. I find that paintings are a hit or miss. Rather than grabbing something that can turn some people off, I respext their decision not to put anything up and look minimal.

And the food was super. It's all local! Can't get fresher than Passion8. I tried everyone's food and they were all amazing. The egg benedict, brisket, lobster, grits, and my Farm Egg Flatbread was pretty awesome. The best part is that none of what I ate was frozen in a container on the back of a 18-wheeler from Cali. So yeah, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was so happy that Passion8 relocated to Elizabeth. I finally get to experience the flavors for myself. The new location is sleek and minimal, with lots of wood. Our meal was terrific. Delicious oysters, charcuterie to start, with the fish of the day and quail for our mains.  All included wonderful combinations of interesting flavors. We will definitely make this one of our regular places."}
{"text":"Food quite tasty but overpriced in my opinion, as entrees average $30. Came here for a celebratory dinner and ordered the catch of the day (nc amber jack with molasses bacon and veggies). Fish portion was large and meaty - could've sized down in size and price and been equally good. Companion had the brisket with lobster bisque and arancini. This dish was the real winner in my eyes as the brisket was tender and matched well with the bisque. Arancini were fried balls of goodness. We finished with \"egg nog cream\" for dessert, which was a very high concept presentation of egg nog flavored custard dabs and wedges of ginger crust dusted with all spice and coconut powder. It was interesting and unique but oddly not very sweet. I would say that the pastry chef and the regular chef are not matched here. 

Overall I liked the local, organic approach but probably would not return based on price/taste."}
{"text":"Good brunch service with live music. Great beignets and french press. Bloody mary with blue cheese stuffed olives and lobster was good. The short rib benedict was good, but a little too sweet. The flatbread pizza with beets, broccolini, and prosciutto wasn't remarkable - again, too sweet and the bread wasn't crispy. Id give the dinner service a shot."}
{"text":"Really good food. We arrived on a busy night for a late reservation (9pm)  made well in advance and hostess communicated there would be an additional 45 minute wait. We were frustrated & hungry and contemplated leaving. The manager stepped in and  bought us each a drink and shared appetizer while offering her apologies. The food ordered at dinner was collectively varied and well loved by the group. We'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"Great food and great cocktails! Definitely get the calamari and try the signature drinks. Love the location in Elizabeth!"}
{"text":"I took my husband to Passion8 for his birthday dinner.  We always meant to try Passion8 at it's Fort Mill location, but for some reason or another, we never did.  I saw that it had moved to Elizabeth and decided to finally give it a try.  I'm so glad we did because it was amazing!  I made a reservation online and received a confirmation email within 24 hours.  When we arrived we were immediately taken to our table (you may not think this is a big deal, but there have been several times we have had reservations at a restaurant and had to wait anywhere from 10-30 minutes for a table).  Our server was Kevin and he was phenomenal.  He was incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the restaurant and the food.  In fact, we took every recommendation he made because he did such a great job of describing each drink or dish.  We started our evening with cocktails.  My husband had a specialty gin and tonic and I had an apple cider cocktail recommended by Kevin.  Both drinks were fantastic!  We shared the pork belly for our first course and it was delicious...so full of flavor.  For the second course, I had the fall vegetable plate.  The vegetables still had just enough crunch without being too raw and the goat cheese and vinaigrette paired perfectly.  My husband had the market salad and he loved it (which is saying something because he is not much of a salad guy).  For our entree we both had the short rib (recommended by Kevin) and it did not disappoint!  The short rib was cooked to absolute perfection and the wine Kevin suggested paired nicely.  Kevin knew it was my husband's birthday and brought us sweet potato panna cotta.  Holy cow!  Truly one of the most unique desserts I've had.  It was sweet and tart (there was a flavored foam that added the tart taste) and the perfect end to a wonderful meal.  Kevin was kind enough to show us the kitchen so we got a peak at Chef Luca and his team which was really neat.  He also gave my husband a signed birthday card from Passion8.  Definitely a nice, personal touch!  Long story short, Passion8 is warm and inviting with an incredible menu and a great team of people.  I cannot wait for an excuse to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. I tried the homemade pasta but it was a special, off-the-menu version by the chef with mussels, baby octopus, and calamari in a red sauce. It was so delicious! The chef himself came out and personally asked about our food which I found very impressive. The other items on the menu that I tried was a cheese and charcuterie plate (the blue cheese and the chicken liver pate were my favorites), the watermelon salad (so good!), and the homemade biscuit dessert which was delightful. 

The service was very good. Our waitress Shelly (I hope I spelled her name right!) was amazing. Her cocktail and food recommendations were spot-on. The decor of the restaurant is very elegant. I will be returning on my next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week. I was incredibly impressed with both the service and the quality of food. The flavors were just right and well-blended. They change their menu every month to use fresh and local ingredients. If you have some money to spend and are looking for a great quality meal, I highly recommend! They were also advertising different events and cooking classes for Valentine's Day, so I think there I more than just food and drinks."}
{"text":"I have come for brunch and a few events. The menu is sophisticated and has all the true foodies in mind. Presentation is everything here. If that's your thing, you will not be disappointed. My favorite are the drinks. Stop by and see Max for a great cocktail."}
{"text":"I waited to review Passion8 until I had a second chance to taste the menu. We went for Valentines Day where the menu was fixed so I thought it unfair to write up a review without fully experiencing the menu/ambiance/etc. 

Unfortunately my preliminary opinion remained unchanged when we revisited this past month. Service was average, food was alright, and the wine list overpriced. 

The most unsettling takeaway from the second experience first hit us when we walked in and the entire restaurant smelled like spoiled fish. Later to find out that this was coming from the scallops... Definitely not something you expect at a high end establishment. 

While this place has hints of being a trendy/foodie/hotspot, it misses the mark on most core fundamentals. I may recommend this to a friend as a place to grab a drink, since the bar area is cool, but that's all."}
