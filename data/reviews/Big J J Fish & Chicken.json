{"text":"These mutha-suckas! I ordered chicken and it smelled like it had been cooked in Pennzoil. I returned it and shared that they needed to change their oil because it's old. The smurf behind the counter quickly became agitated, and told me it was NOT burnt. I never said it was burnt, I told him it was old and they shouldn't serve carcinogens to the public.

He became furious and started slamming things and told me to get the F@ck out. I remained calm, which wasn't easy and told the manager, his brother, I would be happy to leave once I get my money back.  I also explained that I was going to tell all who would listen about how poorly I was treated and never support this chicken shack again!! 

Please drive past these disrespectful, poultry hooligans and do not support their business,"}
{"text":"The wait time for the food was longer than expected but was fried to order.  I ordered chicken and fries and the seasoning smelled fantastic, but the chicken was meh."}
{"text":"What a good filling and enjoyable meal. The fry blew me away and the hush puppies give me Day dreams. I 100 percent would love to go back but seeing as how I live in Florida. I'm gonna need to fly back soon and grab some fry."}
{"text":"Great gyros sandwich

Whole wings

Bretty good fries

Friendly service

Made to order

Like all greasy goods, don't let it get cold. When it's hot, though, it's great. Big portions, too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great staff. Great food and prices. Don't judge a book by it's cover. It's an old but clean building inside and out. Miss my buddies ... done trying \"new\" places ..... sticking with tried and true!!!!"}
{"text":"excellent food and even better customer service.... didnt think when i stepped in that the food would be that great. i was wrong, and damn, the food was fantastic, and the prices, ha cheaper than you could imagine!"}
{"text":"I usually get the buffalo wings, they are phenomenal! Reasonably priced and the people working there are friendly too."}
{"text":"Phone in your orders because they're cooking your food to order.

My last year of undergrad, I called in so many times the guy knew my voice (when I changed my phone number, he still recognized me).

I could eat a half dark meal every day."}
{"text":"I'll be fair, the food is delicious. It reminds me of home. BUT if you order, prepare to wait. I called 58 minutes ago (yes I'm timing them down to the minute because at this point I'm hangry)and was told it would be ready 15 minutes. False! ....Total wait time 1 hour and 7 minutes. Oh and their prices are ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Eaten there many times and I feel the food gets better everytime!! The fish and shrimp are to dye for!! So delicious!! Service is super quick and the people are very friendly!! Definitely make you feel like home with the best comfort food. Will continue to go there when I am in town!!!"}
{"text":"Big jj fish & chicken have the best fried fish chicken &shrimpnice friendly guys work there"}
{"text":"Great find! In Champaign IL for work and looking for something I could drag back to hotel room I found this place on Yelp. 

I Had the catfish fillets and boneless chicken wings. The catfish was AWSOME and very tasty and moist as were the boneless chicken wings. The French fry were also crispy and flavor able. 

The service was quick, staff was very friendly and price was very reasonable.

Only reason for 4 stars was they don't offer BEER and being a road warrior I like to do one stop shopping. I will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"I'm actually quite impressed with the food here. I'm usually not a big fan of fried foods, but all of the food I have tried here is consistently delicious. If you get a meal, between the entree, fries, coleslaw, and bread, there is more than enough food. Personally, my favorite meal is the catfish nugget dinner. I've never been a huge fan of catfish until I tried the catfish at Big JJ's and they sold me on it. Their jalapeno poppers are cheese filled and amazing. Also their buffalo wings are worth a try. Great prices, great food, and the employees are very friendly. Their menu is also enormous and they have pretty good variety across the board. Haven't been disappointed yet and everything I have tried has been exquisite."}
{"text":"They were supposed to be open by 10:30 AM, and I arrived at 10:50. A guy ( white dude almost 6 foot tall), told me they're closed, and they open in 10 minutes. 

I was okay with waiting 10 more minute, but the guy rudely told me to get out, and it was pouring rain outside!

Even if the food does taste good, I will not be back."}
{"text":"I've always passed this place up back in Vallejo so I thought I'd give it a try when I flew in to Illinois.  Both are in sketchy areas but that's nonsense compared to good food."}
{"text":"WOW! If you are looking for that locally owned, finger licking good eatery, with very personable staff, this is the place! Visiting for my first time, Mo and his team made sure I had an experience I'd never forget. The catfish was delicious, the coleslaw was yummy and I'd swear those fat pieces of fried okra were homemade. You will not be disappointed stopping in to see these guys."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!! This place was so good. The fry on the fish and chicken was the best. The service was on the slow side but I'd rather have them take their time to get the meal right. The staff was super cool, the seasoning was oh so tasty, and I will definitely be eating here next time I come through Urbana"}
{"text":"Solid 4.5

Don't be scared off by the appearance.  Yummy food lies within.  The half star is for cleanliness though...i didn't dare peek over the counter into the kitchen after seeing the foyer.

We came in 3:30ish on a Wednesday and there was only one order ahead of us.  But while waiting 7 people came in after.  And it seems they cook to order.  We waited fifteen minutes and it was well worth. (Moral of the story there - it gets busy and ya might wait but it's all good!)

We got a 3 piece mixed chicken that came with fries, white bread, and a small cup of slaw, and a catfish filet basket which was three fried filets with all the above. 

Chicken was crisp,  flavorful,  and well done.  The fish was the star- salty cornmeal batter and well fried.  And no bones.   The fries were well seasoned with seasoned salt and though a bit limp (my fave), they were excellent.  

They packaged it to go with two cups of ketchup,  tartar sauce packets and two smaller cups of hot sauce.  Two meals for just under $20.  Not the cheapest for the food subject BUT it was quality so,  no regrets and,  we'd go back."}
{"text":"Since moving to Champaign from Chicago, I've really come to miss what I would call the \"greasy brown paper bag\" restaurants.  A paper bag filled with a mess of fries and sandwich that are so greasy they leak right through, leaving a dark stain on the bag.

When I came into JJ Fish the first time, I felt like I was back at home in Chicago.  The people inside waiting for their food were talkative and friendly, the guy behind the counter was a bit of a jokester with a sly smirk and a warmth to his demeanor.  The air was thick with fried chicken, fish, and grease.

For $2.99, I got a freshly-cooked fish sandwich served up hot with cheese, tartar sauce, and a whole mess of fries.  The food was very tasty, but wasn't anything terribly special outside the context.  Given the price, though, and the fact that I got to have a humorous conversation with the cashier, it made it worth coming back a week later to do the same.  Later, I'd like to give the chicken a shot, since it seems to be what most everyone else in there orders.  They must know something I haven't yet discovered.

A slice of local Chicago culture a hundred miles outside the city limits."}
{"text":"I was disappointed when The Seaboat closed. It's difficult to find a good fish sandwich. JJ's was recommended and I tried it for the first time Friday. I got a Catfish Sandwich, Fries, and Cole Slaw. I really enjoyed it. The fish was cooked to perfection. The fries had a nice seasoning to them. The staff was very friendly. I look forward to trying their fish the next visit."}
{"text":"I was very surprised to see this on Grub Hub. Was looking for delivery, something other than pizza, Mexican or Chinese. Everyone said fish sounded good, and was it! The catfish was awesome!! I'll try the chicken next time! Delivery was pretty quick and the delivery driver was very kind. Thanks for the great fish! :)"}
{"text":"Placed a large order for a family gathering and they were kind enough to let us pick it up a couple hours earlier than planned. The fish and chicken were gone within minutes. We will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place at night on Memorial Day. The portions and food were great for the price. We got buffalo wings, boneless wings and onions rings and they were all great. The service was fast and the guy was super friendly! We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Nice big portions. And best of all DELICIOUSLY FRIED food. I'm going be coming back"}
{"text":"One of the best wing place in town!  It's definitely to go place with family and friends.  Looking for god price and large amount, big JJ it is!  The staffs are very friendly and polite.  They won't let you down :)"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is a gem! The chicken is outstanding, I am not sure what they put on it but it's addictive!
They threw in a couple pieces of their fish to try and both the catfish and the walleye were ah-maze balls!"}
{"text":"For the price and the portion sizes, this is as good as it gets in Champaign. So glad I discovered this spot. Their subs are huge and the wings are to die for! Apart from the delicious sauce the best part is that the wings are actually huge and meaty which isn't something you come across even at expensive wing places. The fried chicken is pretty good and crispy as well. The desserts are cheap and pretty decent. The guy behind the counter has always been really friendly. All in all it's been a wonderful experience everytime."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out 'cuz I miss the fry-up places in Detroit and Chicago.  Big JJ is pretty dang good.  

I got the catfish fillet sammie.  Tasty fish, a tad on the thin side though, covered in a cornmeal batter.  Everything was right about it.  I'd for sure come back when cravings for fried chick'n or fish overwhelm me.

They have a decent list of sides, and since I somehow didn't notice fries came included in sandwich price; ordered the fried okra.  Yum!  Can't go wrong there.  Had enough leftover fries n' okra to share pre-dinner \"apps\" with some housemates.

Prices here are super reasonable.  It seems mostly a take-out business, as there is very little seating.  It's a tad shabby 'round the edges, as a good you-buy-we-fry shop should be.  Counter guy super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"My work ordered Chicken, catfish, tilapia, hushpuppies, okra and fries. Everyone else said they liked everything. I ate some of everything but the fries and tilapia.  I really liked the catfish and the chicken, the breading was really good, the seasoning was perfect."}
{"text":"Horrible .
it is all grease and salt. no fish, forgot coleslaw, fries not done"}
{"text":"If you like fried chicken and fried fish, you will LOVE it here. All the food is crispy and full of flavor, made to order so it always comes out fresh. If you prefer grilled or baked meat/seafood, you will probably not like it here. But JJ's never claims to be something it's not, so come here with these expectations."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise for me and my mom. We both got the JJ sampler and it was way too much food, we could have shared one, but it was outstanding. The price is really good, the portions generous, the grease level and everything is actually very low and the catfish and hush puppies are to die for. My mom, who ate the chicken, said it was very good too and we both enjoyed the coleslaw and fries as well. Overall, no complaints, only compliments to the owners and cooks here. I will be going back when I feel like fast, fried but high quality down to earth food."}
{"text":"The guy who runs this place is a joke just like his food..."}
{"text":"For a fast food restaurant, this place was great. Excellent customer service, short wait time, and fresh, delicious food. Both the fish and the shrimp that I had were really good. I'd definitely recommend this place for someone who wants quick food, in large amounts, at a cheap price."}
{"text":"New to the Champaign area I was craving some wings. I could easily have gone to the chain wing stops, or tried something off the beaten path. I'm so glad I did! 

The wings are massive and meaty, dripping with the sauce of your choice (or on the side, if you prefer). The mild sauce isn't too hot, and has a hint of sweetness.

I called my order in and walked out of the establishment in 15 minutes with a huge bag of wings! 

10/10 will devour again."}
{"text":"Tried it out yesterday and now I'm having a diarrhea and fever. The environment was awful because there's been decoration in it and dust is everywhere. Taste was ok but it's just too much salt and grease."}
{"text":"I liked this place although the food seems dry and it is halal. Although nice food for fish and fries were tasty."}
{"text":"Don't judge a gift by the wrapping paper. JJ's walleye, wings and tenders are amazing and the friendly guy who runs the place is the icing on the cake. Hands down one of our favorite lunch spots in town."}
{"text":"It's a typical American fast food but they've got better choices for fish than other fast food! :) quantity is good and quality is decent, worth the price :)"}
