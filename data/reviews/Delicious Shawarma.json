{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma platter. It comes with rice and 3 falafels, a good amount of chicken and all the fixins' and salad you'd usually get.  The food was great and the value was spot on. I used to frequent another shawarma establishment in the area but I'll be coming to this one more often. Not only because of the better value but because of the friendly service I received."}
{"text":"They aren't bad and the prices are good. The atmosphere is also good. The only problem is that the pita bread they use for their shawarma is pretty bad. It's too thin I guess and they don't use any type of oil to make the taste better. I think it's just the type you get from the grocery store. The chicken meat itself has too much of a salty taste in a wrap but it's fine by itself so I just get this with a platter now instead of the wrap but it upsets me how they haven't improved their actual wrap since opening, it sorta ruins the shawarma. Also their beef shawarma isn't that good, I think cos the fat isn't always removed but the chicken is fine.  They have this thing called a meat pie (ground beef on pita) which is pretty good though. Also the only shawarma place in this area unless you drive east to Hurontario/Derry."}
{"text":"I come here about once a week for lunch.  Chicken shawarma wrap ($3.99) is a good size and can be dressed with usual accompaniments.  The meat isn't freshly carved and the freshness of the toppings could be better.  Falafels ($2.99 for a wrap) aren't made fresh to order either.  It's a two man operation, so service can be a bit slow.  Leave your jacket on in the winter if you're eating in."}
