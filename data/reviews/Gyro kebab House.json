{"text":"Loved this place! The food is delicious and the owner was extremely hospitable and courteous! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"On a road trip from New York to Iowa, we stopped here for dinner. The owner (who remembered my name from when I called ahead to make sure they were open) made us feel at right at home, and personally served us a stupendous meal. Seriously, the food was incredible. We started with a shepard's salad, falafel, and babaganouj. The salad was delicious and refreshing, the falafel was crispy and well seasoned, and the babaganouj was probably the best I've ever had.   We decided to split a main course, the lamb doner kebab with yogurt. I'm glad we shared, because the portion was huge! I don't usually eat lamb, but this dish was good enough that I might start. We were so stuffed by the time we left that it was hard to drive.   This place is a hidden gem--the service is lovely and the food is to die for. If you're on 80 around Elyria and want a great meal, you won't regret stopping here!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 had heard of this restaurant from a friend at a Greek church we attended. We were pleasantly surprised when we entered the restaurant to see tables with white tablecloths, cloth napkins and lovely water glasses. The owner seated us himself seated us and placed the white cloth napkins on our lap. We ordered based on the owners recommendations - Chicken Adana Kebab, Adana Kebab, Lamb Shish Kebab and Lamb Gyro along with the Shepherd Salad. We finished off our meal with Turkish Coffee and Baklava. The food was fabulous, tasty and tender. Rice was cooked to perfection, pita and roasted vegetables were delicious. Will be back again. And again. Thank you Mehmet!"}
{"text":"A gem in a neighborhood. There are Turkish restaurants in Avon and Cleveland area. I found this restaurant while I was in a business trip, looking something to eat cheap and decent. I am so glad to found this place.   If you like gyro, especially chicken, this is the one you must go. Small, clean and fast food style service. Not a five star fancy place but the food is to die for."}
{"text":"We were traveling through Ohio and were hungry, looked on yelp and saw They had a good rating. Glad we stopped. Large portions and delicious flavors. The owner was kind and courteous. We felt we were eating at a friends house. He talked about some of the history of Turkey and we really appreciated that. And he let us try some sumac seasoning which was very tasty. We had red lentil soup and chicken gyro plate. Yum"}
{"text":"The place is a little bare, but they have the best Gyros I have ever eaten! I asked the owner where they buy their gyro meat as most places buy Kronos brand. He proceeded to tell me they make their own out of lamb and marinade it for 48 hours. It is amazing! I took a few home for my wife!  They are a bit expensive, but the gyro was about 10\" long for $9. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The guy who cooks here cares and it shows. Had a delicious chicken Adana kebab. Fresh salad, tasty tzatziki and grilled veggies. Super fresh baklava to finish it off. I'll definitely be back often. So glad I discovered this gem!"}
{"text":"Great food. The service was excellent, the owner is a very nice and hospitable person, serving sizes were good for two, we tried chicken adana with yoghurt, chicken gyro and red lentil soup. And a small size serving of fries which was pretty generous. Good setup, clean environment and sparkling china!!!=)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great menu selection!! Food was very good, fresh clean flavors. The kids had chicken gyros, they enjoyed. I thought the chicken may have been just a bit dry but it wasn't loaded up w sauce or oil. Lamb kabobs had great flavor!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food - a real diamond in the rough - do not judge this book by it's cover!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent this is my 3rd or 4th time owner is such a nice guy I tell everyone to try it thank you for coming to Elyria"}
{"text":"Stopped in while in town for business, based on positive yelp reviews. Wasn't disappointed. I picked the gyro since it was lunch. All the ingredients seemed very fresh and tasted great. The tazik sauce is made in house and was excellent. My co-worker got the chicken gyro and said it was delicious as well. If I had to give a criticism it would be the cost which is a little higher than average for lunch but not unreasonably so given what you get for your money. The staff was very attentive and helpful, obviously taking pride in what they do. I'll definitely stop in next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is interesting! The owner is an interesting person just opening the restaurant. The food is why you need to come here: It's amazing and the price is right. Hope to see this place do well. The owner serves your meal and conversed with you. He made great recommendations for the food. He even got red pepper for me to make the meal spicy! It was a treat going here and I'll be back. This is the American dream, people!"}
{"text":"Was tired of the same old pizza and burgers routine.  Wanted something different and not too far to drive.  This place just opened up and we decided to give it a try.  The food was great, the atmosphere was marvelous, the owner was charming and informative on the food he served. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is some really awesome food! Don't expect the typical gyro, the spices are a little different, and not greasy! The hummus is wonderful!!! I am not a person that usually enjoys hummus but I totally love theirs, super fresh and full of flavor..... glad they are close by!!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place. So glad we finally did. This is authentic Turkish cuisine. We started with the falafel appetizer and Cigar rolls. The falafel was amazing. Finely ground garbanzo beans and spices in a patty perfectly fried. So good! The Cigar rolls were feta cheese, parsley and dill rolled up in Phyllo dough and fried. My favorite of the evening! I had the Chicken Kebab which came with rice and small salad. The chicken was tender and juicy. My husband had the Chicken Kebab with Yogurt. His was a thinly sliced chicken in a tomato sauce served over soft pita chips and yogurt. Both plates would have fed two people! The owner greeted us as we entered and gave us some small tastings of what they had to offer. Delicious. A must try is the Cacik sauce. Similar to tzatziki sauce but oh so much better! He was our guide thru his menu and a total gentleman."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very friendly service.  The owner is very helpful with any questions."}
{"text":"Myself and my Wife went to the Gyro Kebab House and had a wonderful meal. Not only was the meal awesome the staff were the friendliest people I have met of just about any restaurant I have been to in the USA. I have spent many years overseas and I had to pinch myself because I thought I was still there. The food was excellent. The Staff were very friendly. I am serious when I say this but they treat you like there own family."}
{"text":"So I will have to admit that at first, I passed right by this place due to the sign that almost looks like it was drawn with crayon..lol! But after thinking about what to have for dinner...my husband and I decided to give this Mediterranean place a try. Upon entering, I noticed that something was going on with the A/C because it was warm. But the friendliness of the person that greeted us as soon as we entered made up for that.       There are pics of the meals that help with choosing your meal. I had the Shepard salad and a side of Falafels. The falafels were the best I have ever had!!!  The shepherd salad was also freshly delicious!!! The hubby had a lamb gyro and he said it was very tasty but wished it came with pita bread instead of a hoggie type bread.         I really loved the food and will definitely be back. I gave it four stars because of external appearance...but really....who cares if the food is great!!! Also...it is a little on the pricey side but I guess that's because the quality of the food is fresh. Honestly I'd rather pay a little more if worth it and this place is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"If you're tired of burgers and pizza, run, don't walk, to this restaurant. There was a brisk carry-out business while I was there, but half the fun is eating in with Mehmet as owner/server. Food is amazing, and don't skip the Shepherd Salad."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here on our way home from shopping thinking this was fast food, it is not by far!!!  We decided to try the food we were so surprised as this is authentic Turkish food! This is not a fast food. We had the sampler for two and it was a good choice! Come check it out, you won't be disappointed....... unless you expected McDonalds"}
{"text":"Way too expensive. Food was ok but the building wasnt spruced up and still crappy looking."}
{"text":"The owner seated us himself.  Chairs pulled out,  napkins placed on your lap,  ice water poured...He took the time to explain the menu and to make suggestions. The shepherd salad was a delight - fresh,  bright flavors.  Three cigar rolls were yummy - feta cheese wrapped in phyllo dough.  We tried the sampler platter and a lamb gyro- all were excellent.  Everyone had different favorites.  And you must try the baklava for dessert - one order and everyone gets to try a bit.  Our best wishes for continued success! The only changes I would suggest would be a different location - downtown! A liquor licence, and turn the ac on!"}
{"text":"I've NEVER had food like this before and I am HOOKED! Started out with a shepherd's salad. Tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, Turkish seasoning it was delicious. I had Adana Lamb Kebob and Ray had a lamb gyro with yoghurt, it had a tomato based sauce over the top. I personally thought, a gyro with tomato sauce, it just doesn't sound right. People it was wonderful, NOT like anything I've had. A wonderful flavor. I'm not talking that this had pasta sauce dumped on it. This was seasoned with Turkish seasoning and if I could learn how to make it I would put it on my cereal in the morning. We had so much food that we waddled back to the car with enough in to go boxes that I dont have to cook dinner today. The owner opened my car door, helped me up, held the door to the building open, took us to a table with real tablecloths, held my chair out for me and put my cloth napkin in my lap! The restaurant itself is handicapped accessible but I didn't think to check the restrooms. The place is CLEAN. If I had to come up with a criticism it would be that it was rather warm inside but the owner would go over to the thermostat and then it would cool down to a more comfortable temperature. But it definitely isn't something that will keep me from going back. They also have carryout. Try the Turkish baklava it was worth trying to find room for it at the end."}
{"text":"AWESOME...everyone need to try this place. The food and service was excellent.  Its a newer resturant in Elyria i hope it does well."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town, but I lived here previously, and wanted Mediterranean food. We saw this new resturant, and decided to give it a go. Our waiter, I assume he was the owner, treated us well. We all got different things, I got the chicken adana kebab with yogurt, my boyfriend the adana kebab with yogurt, and mother in law got the lamb shish kebab. The yogurt kebabs are over pita bread and come with salads. The regular kebabs come with salad, are over pilaf, and come with cucumber sauce and pita bread. We also ordered filafals, and it turned out to be so much food. The plates are very large and very worth the price. It may seem a bit expensive but you get a great quality food in a large portion. Even my boyfriend only ate about half of his plate, and he can eat.   It's a new restaurant, so it's very clean, and quiet. Had some retro 90s+ 00s music playing, which was ideal for me anyways.   I definetely hope to come back in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing food you have to try at least once. Price is a little higher than other restaurants in Elyria but the quality is unmatched. Owner is wonderful friendly and very accommodating. Expand your horizons to the Mediterranean with this amazing food try a falafel chicken shawma or anything it's all amazing here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here based off great reviews. After reading a few, I expected the owner to be a gregarious person. I had no idea. It was raining and he came out with an umbrella and walked me inside. I thanked him generously and he simply said, \"Of course, you're my guest!\". The dutiful hospitality didn't stop there and I was treated like an honored guest the entire time. The food was a hefty, delicious helping. Service like this is a truly special thing, and it's important that people support businesses like this."}
{"text":"Place opened up in the old KFC. Front door and counter area are similar, but tables with white table cloths and cloth napkins are a marked upgrade from a fast food joint. Had the lamb shish kebab which was cooked to order. Large platter with lamb, tomato and bell pepper were removed from skewer and nicely presented. Lamb chunks were sliced and served over cut up pita with a red and white sauce. Meat was tender and mildly flavored, easily eaten with just a fork. Salad was fresh and crisp. Overall, a very tasty and satisfying meal. I'll be back to try other dishes. Owner is very personable and all staff seem very dedicated to preparing good food."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best dinner places that I have here in Elyria. The owner of this place is very accommodating and gave us his recommendation what tastes good. I also appreciate the fact that he took care of us and attentive to us. The place is clean and is perfect for group dinners and also date nights! The food is fantastic, I ordered the lamb dish kebab. The plating very good, good amount of servings and the taste is very delicious. I will recommend this to everyone in town."}
{"text":"Was in Ohio for a few days and had requested that Dad join me & my friend for lunch. My friend & I were set on Gyros. When we arrived, we were greeted by Mehmet and Dad introduced him to us,then had to leave, but put in his order for Gyro  to go. Mehmet  gave us the introduction to the menu and what platters & appetizers we might try. Totally overwhelmed with the options and food combos , my friend & I wanted to stay true to our pursuit of Gyros. Service was accompanied w/ details of the Turkish cuisine and land.  Mehmet brought a sampler plate & gyro platters.. it was DELICIOUS!- It was alot more than we had set out to consume that sitting- but worth every bite. Dad returned to pick up his order and Mehmet brought out Baklava for us! We had to take it w/ us, we were so full : ).. But it was good as well, not sticky/syrup-y like most.  -When we were leaving we took pictures in the parking lot, It was Total Eclipse Day, and our selfies had the eclipse in the shots!!-  a good day.  Kudos to the Kebab House and we plan on returning. Best regards to your success!! - W"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Don't let the exterior make you think it's fast food. Nice on inside, tablecloths on table, quiet atmosphere. Service is fast and friendly. Prices are extremely reasonable. Even the chef came out to say hello. The food is superb. I got a Gyro kebab and the wife got chicken. So fantastic and delicious. Don't pass up this place."}
{"text":"My first impression was that the signs and advertising graphics were sketchy looking and unappealing, but I live a couple blocks from this place and have been craving a good medditaranian spot that was local. I went in for lunch and realized the vibe was confusing. If you look to the right, there are tons of chairs laid out with nice napkins and glasses for dinning. However you look to the left, and it had a hole-in-the-wall sketchy (in a good way) vibe. Kind of like that Chinese joint we all have and love, but you're pretty sure they wouldn't pass a health inspection with flying colors. That vibe. So that confused me. The girl greeted me friendly and asked what I'd like. I ordered a falfal wrap. The wrap itslef was okay. Granted I'm comparing it to another one that absolutly blows my mind, so I'm biased, but it was okay. I added the tahini sauce that they gave me. Mixed it up with some hot sauce I had at home and that made it tasty. So overall I'd say this place is worth a try, especially if you're in the mood for some quick Mediterranean food but don't want to drive far. I'll probably try a couple of other things on the menu before all is said and done. But for my first experience I'll have to give it a \"ehh it's okay.\" I hope this place thrives. It's nice having a different option in the area to go to for food. So in summary. Good is okay, service was good, vibe is confusing."}
{"text":"Discovered them today as I was looking for a Mediterranean 'takeout' - her is my review of the individual dishes as I did not dine in...  Vegetarian Casserole - 3.0/5.0 - essentially a stew/soup with very little flavor or body... I was hoping for a bit more zest ;)  Hummus appetizer - 4.0/5.0 - no complaints  Chicken Shishkebab - 4.5./5.0 - this was the standout as per my family - ten pieces of cubed chicken in bed of rice with side salad...   Overall, I am happy to have found them... order was packed nicely, in time (fast!), and quantities are good... place looked very clean and laid out nicely for a dine-in experience..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend got the Chicken Adana with yogurt and I got the Adana with yogurt and both were really good. If I had a little less self control of have stuffed my face and passed out on the floor in a food coma. This price is a little high, but for how much delicious food you get, it's well justified."}
{"text":"They have the best gyro meat I've ever had. I love gyros, I've had a lot from a lot of restaurants. This is the best - hands down. My wife got lamb and I got chicken and they were both amazing."}
{"text":"I think they need to make their gyros more delicious and cheaper. Their meat is not delicious enough. They may offer additional sauces in their sandwiches.  People can eat full line of buffet for $10 vs eating a sandwich for $9. Other places sell gyros for around $6 in average. That means there are cheaper places as well."}
{"text":"How is this place not packed full of people?? This food is all homemade and the service is excellent! When the food is served it is a treat to all your senses.  The aroma hits you first, then you see how beautifully plated it is.  But, the taste..., mmmmm so delicious.   I will be back many times for this comforting ethnic food"}
{"text":"The staff is extremely friendly.  This my 3rd time here and have never had less than 5 star service and the most flavorful food imaginable."}
{"text":"This is such a great addition to Elyria!!! Food is delicious and authentic, service is out of this world, and the owner is passionate about his restaurant and his patrons!! We had enough food for 2 meals...and it was so good we almost ate it all in 1 sitting. Can't recommend this place enough!!"}
{"text":"The food (Adana lamb kebab over yogurt) was tasty BUT it was lukewarm at best when served. Cold when finished. The server (Gerald) was so involved with pleasing another couple he didn't bring my wife's cucumber dressing (lamb pita) after requesting he do so. It was obvious he was trained to interact with customers that he forgot to perform his basic duties before doing so. The chef/owner came out and engaged in an involved conversation with said couple who praised the food so much that he brought out a desert and gift card for them while we sat and listened."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service is what you\"ll receive at this great new restaurant.  I had the lamb kabob which was excellent and my wife had the red lentil soup and salad which was also excellent. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Possibly the best hummus I've ever eaten! Food was delicious. I had the cigar rolls appetizer and the Adana kebab, it was absolutely perfect. The Adana was juicy and tender and so good! Will be back again!"}
