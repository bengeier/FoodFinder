{"text":"This place is a hidden Newmarket gem. Other sushi houses get a lot more exposure due to their location and visibility but this place has the best food all-around. The freshness and quality of the sashimi is beyond expected and the service is great. The reason why this place isn't famous is due to its location on the seedy side of Davis but locals should definitely give it at try. After visiting this place with my family we now frequent this AYCE sushi over any other. Prices are decent for AYCE and they are flexible towards which menu you may order off of. Unlike other places they will let you order from the dinner menu at lunch if you are willing to pay."}
{"text":"This place offers tasty, AYCE sushi at a good price. I redeemed a Groupon here without any problems. They have a large AYCE sushi menu and a decent-size kitchen menu. I'm not an expert on sushi so I can't describe all the different things they had (look at their menu, on their facebook page, for a list), but they had some really interesting ones (e.g., cucumber-wrapped rolls) and unlike other sushi places they don't hide the seafood. Everything was tasty, and much tastier than other sushi AYCE's I've been to in the GTA. The sushi rice was fresh and had the right texture, and the fish was fresh.

The restaurant itself was clean and had the right temperature - I find most sushi AYCE's to be way too hot and stuffy, but this place felt great. The service was lightning fast. We got our sashimi less than 120 seconds after ordering it - unbelievable. Other places have made us wait up to 20 minutes for sashimi. The rest of the food followed shortly thereafter.

My biggest complaint is that they ran out of several dishes - avocado, salmon belly, and ice cream (80% of their desert menu). Maybe they couldn't handle the Groupon crush but it felt unprofessional - salmon belly is understandable, it's just one item on the menu, but avocado? It's an ingredient in many of their rolls - almost as bad as running out of rice! 

But it was a nice evening with faster service than I've ever had in a sushi AYCE. I would definitely recommend it and I would go back, even without the Groupon, and even though it is all the way in Newmarket."}
{"text":"This Japanese all you eat restaurant just opened this week (April 23, 2012) and I am very impressed! There are several all you can eat Japanese restaurants in Newmarket but this one is the best by far. The salmon sashimi is very fresh and the yummy yam roll is a must try. The hand rolls are made with fresh seaweed so it's very crunchy, which is very hard to find in all you can eat restaurants, they are usually soggy and soft. The spider roll is also very good, the soft shell crab is hot inside the roll, very delicious. The beef roll with garlic is also a good selection. Right now they are having a pre-open special with a 15% discount, not sure how long that will last for. Weekday lunches are $16.99 for adults and $21.99 for dinner. We will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Maybe the outside if this place looks a little bit shady but once inside it's quite nice, clean and the staff are friendly. Sashimi, sushi, special maki rolls were all fresh and very flavorful. Great value for 20.99 dinner and 14.99 lunch. Definitely will return to this place soon."}
