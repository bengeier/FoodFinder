{"text":"Was driving by on a Saturday at 6:15, on our way to someplace else-- hungry as H-E-double hockey sticks. Walked inside-- it looked interesting and wasn't busy, so we gave it a shot.

Our waitress was very friendly... and amazingly disorganized. It took her four trips to bring our drinks. First she came by to ask what we wanted. My partner wanted Diet Pepsi; I asked if they had chocolate shakes. She needed to see if the ice cream was soft enough. (?)

Comes back with the Pepsi. Is the Ice Cream OK? She forget to check, so I ask for water.

Comes back with the water... and still forgot to check. I order a Pepsi.

\"Oh, good\", she says. \"I just poured a Pepsi and then I realized it was supposed to be diet.\" She didn't realize that the person who ordered it was sitting next to me at the counter. (She realized it when she brought a refill later.)

Brings back the Pepsi... \"BTW, the ice cream, is OK When we get it in, sometimes it's really frozen and we have to let it thaw until we can work with it..\"

Had they been busy, this would have been a nightmare. Having that much sweat equity invested, I got a shake. She asked if I wanted whipped cream (yes). It was so thick it had to be eaten with a spoon. It's VERY good. (The whipped cream is sweetened; the chocolate shake doesn't seem to be made with syrup-- just milk & ice cream.)

Asked what was good. \"We sell a lot of the roast beef and the meatloaf. The cheesesteak is very good. So is the pulled pork. But if you want something else, just ask me, I'll tell you-- and I'm not a very good liar, so you'll know.\"

I'd spotted something on the menu, so I asked about the fish & chips. \"Oh, yeah-- That's really good.\" 

It was. Three medium-size pieces of fish-- but fish that hadn't been t frozen-- with a nice beer batter. It was blazing hot and crisp. It came with a huge handful of fresh-cut fries (peels on), 3 hush puppies (not from a mix) and cole slaw that probably came in a big tub-- and is stored at an uncooled salad station. 

Again a service note: I had a choice of regular fries, steak fries or curly fries. I ordered \"steak\"; I got \"regular.\" (I didn't bother sending them back-- I prefer \"chips\", but these looked good. They were.)

The other order was a fistful of pulled pork (incredibly moist and soft), curly fries (vastly better than Arby's), 8 hush puppies and (by choice) a big bowl of pasta  salad with a homemade dressing. (Oddly enough, none of the barbecue orders come with bread and butter.) The only real lowlight on the plate was the sauce (which tasted bottled).

We split an order of the fried Mac & Cheese-- it came out lickety-split and was so hot that we actually had to let it cool. It's got about 15 triangles (enough for two), is made with lots of real cheddar and comes with a big bowl of dipping sauce 

The pies are out in a display case. The selections change from day to day; we didn't order any because (a) we were stuffed and (b) that day's selection didn't appeal to us (peanut butter pie in 90-degree heat?). They're huge; they looked good.

Can I imagine the place getting backed up? Yup. The two waitresses greeted almost everyone who walked in by name-- but they were always asking people to wait a minute. (We had to ask for silverware and ketchup.)  I can believe, when it gets busy, that people could get cold food-- or the wrong food..

But what we got was VERY good. And it was $27. I think if I drove by again-- and saw that it was packed-- I'd keep driving. But if it wasn't busy, I'd stop. And, based on the pulled pork, I'd probably go for the roast beef."}
{"text":"Classic diner atmosphere. Definitely would recommend trying the big dig. Very good burger. Got the curly fries to go with it and won't be getting those again. They were to hard and unappetizing. Will definitely go back though."}
{"text":"The wait was a little long but man was it worth it! Everything was homey as can be. The homemade bread and sausage patty were right out of mommas kitchen and quality and size of the pancakes absolutely topped off the meal. Cheap, homey, and delicious!!! I would definitely suggest this."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch on a Saturday. It was pretty slow. We had a cup of chili, which was sweet, thick, tasty, with beans--would have been good on fries. My husband had the meatloaf dinner. The meatloaf was tasty, mashed potatoes were alright, the green beans were just green beans. The ciabatta roll that came with it, after he asked, was very, very good, made at Nancy's Bakery down the street. I had a make your own omelet, with bacon, cheddar, peppers, onions, along with a side of home fries and wonderful Nancy's bakery wheat bread. The omelet was good, big, had a good proportion of ingredients inside; taters were a little greasy but not bad. We shared a slice of peanut butter pie, and it was delicious. We tried to get to the bakery down the street to see what kind of goodies we could take home, but they close at 3 on Saturday, so we missed it. We will try it again."}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast with a  very good friend.  The atmosphere was retro and welcoming. I had the gypsy breakfast platter. It included eggs,cheese,ham,and homefries. Delicious and filling. The homemade rye toast was awesome!  I will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, Nancy's MSD has the most delicious food, especially breakfast!! We ordered their specialty French Toast and classic Biscuits & gravy! So so so delicious!!!!
Can't wait to try more classics!! A+++"}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday for lunch and it was relatively busy. However the food was not up to par. I got a turkey club and it was cold. The waitress got both our orders wrong and was very slow. She also seemed very carefree about helping us. The only television they had on was showing \"Golden Girls,\" which nobody seemed to be watching. Also, trying to get the check to leave this place took 15 minutes. Very bad experience overall."}
{"text":"Been there many times. You must try the homemade biscuit and sausage gravy. The best I have ever ate."}
{"text":"Great old diner, staff if super freindly. No frozen food here! They make it all from scratch and it is wonderful. Do yourself a favor and get the homemade rye bread for your toast, omg...so awesome! We live all the way out in Berea but stop by Nancys when we are in town!"}
{"text":"If you like vintage diners with affordable, home style food, then this is the place for you! Everything here is homemade, so it's not as fast of service as some other diners (like Waffle House), but it's worth the wait. I came here with my husband and in-laws on Sunday morning around 10:30, and we were able to find one of the last available booths. We had to wait 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive, but the coffee was delicious and they kept the refills coming. The decor has a strong 50's vibe - lots of Betty Boop, muscle cars, and retro posters on the walls. The staff was friendly and attentive.

My food was insanely huge. I ordered the make your own omelette with veggies and pepper jack cheese. As a side with your omelette, you have a choice of toast and hash browns, 2 slices of french toast, or 2 pancakes. I wanted to try the pancakes, so that was my choice. YOU GUYS. The two pancakes were the size of dinner plates. I was kind of assuming the side dish version of a pancake would be smaller than the entree size, but they were exactly the same. They were really fluffy and buttery, and perfectly browned (seriously, how do diners make such perfect pancakes). For $7.50 I had enough for two meals, PLUS had help eating my pancakes from the others in my party. Also, the bread here is homemade, and you have a choice of white, wheat, or rye. Big toasty slabs of bread, and you get TWO pieces! I snuck a bite of my husbands because it looked so good. 

I love a good diner, and I love a good deal. I'll be back to try the lunch items!"}
{"text":"Awesome greasy spoon diner!  I met a couple of friends here since I was on this side of town.  
There's two parts to this restaurant.  One part is classic 50's diner and the attached part is an extension.  As usual, when we all walked in, we sat ourselves, not without commenting about the cloying pie and coffee aromas in the front car.  Heavy and comforting, you automatically feel as if you'd made the best choice for lunch!  It's retro decor instantly lifts your mood.
Anyway, the server was sweet and attentive, although the joint was packed with regulars.  There's a decent sized menu (kids menus are also available) featuring the classic greasy spoon breakfast options, sandwiches, salads and burgers.  We always stare at the menus because, as my friend says, \"It's hard to decide 'cause everything is good!  There isn't a bad item on the menu!\" 
He ordered a breakfast skillet, his wife ordered a monte cristo, pancakes/bacon for the toddler, and I ordered a turkey club.
As usual, it was fantastic.  Portions are large, and you can choose between three fry options: regular, curly, or steak. Get the curly of you like Arby's type fries.  
The service is great, but expect to be patient if you come during a busy time. This is a mom-n-pop place, not a chain that has everything pre-cooked."}
{"text":"We eat at Nancy's regularly.  It's a great diner with a 50's atmosphere.  The food is all homemade and creative.  I would not describe it as a greasy spoon but delicious diner food.  This is not a place that microwaves already prepared food so it's not 5 mins to get your meal.  We typically wait about 15 mins for our meal and it is always well worth the time and the price.  I have never even seen Nancy, she is always cooking away in the kitchen."}
{"text":"We're talking diner, here, not tie-required dining so this is a diner 4 star!
Stopped here on a whim for lunch today, based on the old trucker's \"How full is the parking lot?\" method of selection.
It was Sunday 1 PM-ish and they were slammed!
Seat yourself.
Usually when I inquire as to the relative merit of a dish that is not in the server's personal wheelhouse, I get a \"I dunno, I don't like that!!\" kinda non-response coupled with a dull, \"I think I'm nauseous\" look from my server.
Odd, how servers so often think I'm there to inquire as to what THEY do and don't like, rather than to dine myself, hopefully with some guidance from an \"insider\"???!!!!
I've gotten \"I don't eat meat!\" I don't eat seafood!\" even \"Ewwwheh!!!!\" et al....
Here, although the young lady didn't like the item, she said she sold a lot of it and everyone she had served it to had commented on how good it was, at which point another waitress overheard the inquiry and said my item was \"Her favorite!, and  \"She loved it!\"
So without further deliberation I ordered the liver and onions.
Yeah, I can hear the moans!
However the lady ordered it as well, so I'm not alone!
And it's an excellent dish by which to judge the ability of the chef in this type of establishment.
Anybody can pull the fries when the timer beeps, and anybody can cook a hamburger without starting a forest fire, liver actually requires some skill.
It wasn't perforated with that sinewy stuff that so often is part and parcel, and it was quite tender, likely the result of a marinade.
It was Perfectly cooked!  
No shoeleather here as is oft the case!
Served with choice of slaw, salad or soup; choice of potato, choice of veggie, and bread, a home baked miniloaf.
Potatoes, mashed, came-off as maybe homemade, with no tinny aftertaste.
Gravy was fine, but no true homemade, rich pan-drippings taste.
Asked for extra onions.  
Got 'em!
Kudos!
I was heard again!
Good veggie sides, salads and slaw (soup didn't make our table today), and plenty of refills and checkbacks by the waitress.
All for under twenty bucks plus tip!
In the words of Arnold, \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Nancy's Diner is as good as it gets for a delicoius home-cooked breakfast.  If you come here on a weekend morning, you'll see many others agree--it's always packed!  Everything is made-to-order, so sometimes it takes a little while to get your food, but it's worth it.  My favorites are the Hobo breakfast and the Skillet.  I wish I could comment more on the rest of the menu, but I have a hard time getting anything but those two dishes!  They're great about customizing your order too--I'm always so picky and add on all kinds of ingredients, and they always get it right.  Their homemade white toast it to die for, too. And the pies--baked fresh every day (the owner gets up at the crack of dawn every day to start baking), they're amazing! You can't go wrong with Nancy's for a home cooked meal!"}
{"text":"Nancy's has been a family favorite for years. Tasty diner food at its best!  Their home fries can't be beat."}
{"text":"I have been going to Nancy's since I was 5 years old. The food quality is almost always good and the staff is very friendly. Their burgers are the best you will find in Lorain County. They also have very good specials almost everyday. The homemade pies and Cakes are AMAZING! They always have a good selection. One of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Outstanding home cooked meals.  There is something good for everyone here.  Wonderful baked goods and pies.  The daily specials are always worth considering.  Comfort food at a relaxed pace.  Great value and ample portions."}
{"text":"Sorry I stopped here.  There are signs all over the place announcing that food prep time ranges from 15 to 45 minutes.  This is not at all a \"gourmet\" restaurant.  The menu is just diner food, and not upscale.  I ordered a cheese omelette with home fries and was warned that it would take 25 minutes because \"everything is prepared fresh.\"  What do they do, go out and shake down the chickens for fresh eggs?

I worked my way through life as a cook.  Diners, flop houses, and gourmet restaurants.  Never, ever has it taken me 20 minutes to flip an omelette, no matter how busy things got.  I explained this to the waitress, who was not at all busy, and my food came out in ten minutes.

And it was good!

So if you're really not in a hurry, take your chances with Nancy's."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here one morning, the place is a small charming place with friendly waitresses.  It was pretty busy when we went; I ordered the pecan pancakes.  The order came out fairly quickly, the pancakes are huge and had a fair amount of pecans.  Here's how I judge a pancake:  1) flavor and texture, it has to have it's own flavor and not just a box mix.  2) moistness, for obvious reasons, 3) syrup flavor, I hate when I have to absolutely drench a pancake because it has no flavor.  This one was fine but nothing to knock my socks off about.  (Cracker Barrell pecan pancakes are simply oozing with pecans!)  The batter used was simple, at least it wasn't dry as some places serve.  The syrup was fine.  

So, maybe I'm just picky but this is not a place for pancakes in my book.  The relative who took us lives in the area felt that there are no really good places for breakfast in the area but would I go again?  Certainly, just because I didn't care all that much for one dish doesn't mean I wouldn't enjoy another dish.  Especially since the ratings are great!"}
