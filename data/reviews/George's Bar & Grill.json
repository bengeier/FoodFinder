{"text":"I was casually walking by on a snowy Toronto noon, when I happened to come across this small mom & pop restaurant and decided to come in.  To my surprise, it was quite good.  I was greeted by a very friendly old man that kind of reminds me of those perfect grandfathers you always wanted.  I proceeded to order the Gyro combination special that came with either fries or a salad and a drink.  He proceeded to point me to the mini refridgerator right next to me and told me to help myself to any selection.  Next, he gave the order to another older gentlemen, and they proceeded to cook up this meal.  I was very pleasantly surprised that the gyros tasted good, and the pita bread was toasty grilled.  The fries were good, the usual Greek affair.  Yes, this is nothing like what I get in New York, but it is on par with what I get in California.  I am a fan, since it is hard to find good gyros that is any better than Dauphne's Greek Grill.  It is open for breakfast and closes around 3 PM and appears to offer other items as well, such as kabobs and hamburgers.  Well, if I have a craving for Greek food some time, I would definitely come back here if I am in town."}
{"text":"This was a nice spot for lunch.  This is a very friendly, casual Greek restaurant. I had the feeling that most of the customers are regulars who visit at least a couple times a week. The man behind the counter (George, possibly) seemed to know everyone. He asked me if I had been there before, then went off on how great the daily special was (chicken souvlaki with salad and rice). I was kind of craving gyros, though, so to his disappointment, I ordered it. I regret it later when I saw how amazing the special looked on other tables.   Foodwise, it was your standard fare/quality. My only complaint is that they didn't seem to understand the whole \"dairy allergy\" thing so I got big blocks of feta on my salad. But hey, the feta appears to be the real deal and there was lots of it. It was pretty easy to move them off the salad more or less in one piece."}
{"text":"Nice mom and pop place.  The decor is very 80's but it's very clean.  Ordered chicken soulvaki and it was good.  Salad was fresh.  Too bad it does not have roast potato."}
