{"text":"It isn't really hard to notice that this place is  heavily skewed towards Magic: The Gathering, but to be fair they do have some board games and other board game goodies. And what I think is a big plus is that they do run their own events, which isn't all that common.  Read More - http://ilovetoronto.com/toronto-real-estate/2015/09/board-game-stores-toronto"}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of board games and a staff that knows them pretty well. I've had many excellent recommendations from staff members and have purchased quite a few great games from them in the past five months that are now staples amongst my friend group. Furthermore, whenever they don't have a game in they'll gladly order in a copy. Also, their prices are the lowest I've seen, having visited a few similar places in both Toronto and Ottawa. Bottom line: great selection, great pricing, and lots of friendly and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"They just opened and I'm glad they're in my neighbourhood. I've never stayed to play games, but they seem to have a lot of stuff happening, and an eclectic mix of patrons that all seem to get along playing some intense games.  
I've only ever been to buy some games and the staff was super helpful. 
This place seems like a less hipster and more authentic version of snakes and lattes. It is what it is and it doesn't try to dress it up. Great place!

I'm updating to say that I've stayed for games and had a blast! You don't have to pay to play, which is AWESOME and leaves you with some cash to actually buy the games you enjoyed! They also serve food and drinks."}
{"text":"I enjoyed coming into this game store. I often find when I go into hobby stores the people are more focussed on serving their regulars, and people who are new more or less get a cold shoulder. However, the people here were pretty awesome. They were nice, the coffee bar was awesome, I came in for a gaming thing and they were cool with that. They also had a magic draft going that night, and they had games I wanted to buy, I plan on buying some stuff from these guys before I head back to L.A.. They are an excellent gaming store/cafe."}
{"text":"Placed an order for just over $1,000 on their website. About two weeks later I get an email stating that I owe $18 in shipping and that it's MY fault for it not being correctly applied. I replied that it's not my problem their back-end isn't configured properly. Continued to argue via email. So they have the time to go back and forth and piss off their customers, but not to satisfy them?  

Seriously, don't waste your time with this company. Service? None"}
{"text":"I was ecstatic to hear that there would be a board & card games retailer in my neighbourhood, and when my wife and I stopped in to check it out, my excitement was certainly justified!

Face to Face is a Magic: The Gathering & CCG retailer, but they have a healthy selection of other board and card games, as well as a very comfy free-play area with nice big couches for casual games with friends. They also have a large main play area with rows of tables perfect for tournaments and events, which they hold regularly.

We had the pleasure of meeting the manager, Kelly, who is an incredibly friendly, down-to-earth guy who's very passionate about gaming and making Face to Face an amazing place moving forward. According to Kelly, they plan to start serving food and drink sometime in the coming months, which will certainly make it my default meeting place for friends and family.

Face to Face is an exciting addition to the area, and I can't wait for it to reach its full potential!"}
{"text":"I have had nothing but a good experience with this store. I was in the store the other day and was pleased to see a diverse and pleasant group of individuals taking advantage of the in-store game space. Placed a few online orders with the website and I find the selection and  prices to be better then the other stores I was dealing with. Customer service is amazing which is something I appreciate greatly."}
