{"text":"Unreal prices for really good food. A Reuben, chicken Caesar wrap, French fries, and fried zucchini  + a large diet coke was $12. Try finding that anywhere else in the valley and I guarantee the quality is bad. I had all three meals for 3 days while we had our baby. We're going to have dinner there every week"}
{"text":"This place is the best!  When you're in Southern Hills and you need a cup of joe you're so lucky to be able to come here!  The folks who run it are awesome.  They'll make you any sort of coffee or espresso drink under the sun!  Employees get a discount."}
{"text":"Would it be weird to say that the best blended coffee drink I've ever had was at a hospital? Yes? Well, regardless, the almond joy blended drink ($4.90 regular, $4.75 with badge) was the BEST drink ever. Price was fair for the quality & quantity of product.  Service was very cordial. Guy working the register (7/28/14) could not have been more pleasant.   Coffee shop is more like a small bar on the left side of the main entrance. Easy to grab in less than 5 minutes on your way in / out of the hospital.   I live close and I'm not above coming here for a drink in my off hours."}
