{"text":"This place is fantastic. Went with a group of 5 for a birthday dinner, and each person in our party was blown away by the food, service and ambiance. This place provided an exceptional dining experience.  FOOD: We started out with a gazpacho, made in house, accompanied by a plantain (sent out as hors d'oeuvres by the Chef).  It had a a hint of jalape√±os taste to it but was not super spicy. Just divine. We shared three appetizers: an avocado shrimp dish, a goat cheese tartlet, and grilled calamari served in a ratatouille. Each dish was exceptional. A mere prelude to the main courses. I ordered the duck confit, which literally melted off the bone. It was served with lima beans, and each bite was a flavour explosion of awesome. Others ordered the steak frites and the lamb shank. Both incredibly tender, the lamb shank particularly was amazing - served in a chocolate sauce that was rich but not overbearing. Then came desserts. A lemon tart and some sort of banana cake with chocolate. And ice cream. Both were marvellous. Re: drinks - I didn't taste the cocktails, but apparently the Maple Old Fashioned is one of the best drinks you'll ever have.    SERVICE: Our server was the epitome of on the ball. He ensured we always had everything we needed, and also had a killer sense of humour.   AMBIANCE: The staff is incredibly warm and friendly, and made us feel so welcome. It was like going to a friend's house for dinner. It's a beautiful space, wonderful lighting and the chairs are shockingly comfortable; they're rounded and padded and swivel and it's like sitting in a super comfy recliner.   Both the chef and owner came out just to check on us and make sure everything was good. The people that work here genuinely care about providing a top notch dining experience. If you want somewhere authentic and warm, with delicious food that won't break the bank, this is the place."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Darwin! I made a last minute reservations online on a Saturday night for a table of 5 with no problem. The restaurant had a warm ambiance, with tea lights and fresh flowers in mason jars on each table. The service was excellent and our waiter was both knowledgeable and witty.   As for the food, the lamb shank was a bit under seasoned, but laid on top of a bed of fresh peppers and zucchini. The salmon was cooked perfectly, but nothing extraordinary. The most outstanding dish was the avocado shrimp cocktail. It is not your typical shrimp cocktail where cold shrimp is hanging off a cocktail cup; it is consists of seasoned grilled shrimp over an avocado salad. Absolutely delicious and original! For dessert, the apple tart was good, but it is not what you imagine when someone says apple tart. It is more like the apple tart contents were placed on top of a fluffy pastry. The winner was the chocolate banana pudding. It was warm, with molten chocolate all over it, in a small ceramic pot-like dish. Both desserts are big enough to share between 2 people.   I would definitely go back, and from what I heard from neighboring tables, Darwin is a place they often visit as well!"}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary and booked in advance. We enquired about a tasting menu and was told it was not a problem. The price was 65 dollars for five courses. After seeing people pay 25 and 30 dollars for three courses of the exact same thing we received, we realized that we over paid by a lot. Typically with a tasting menu you get several smaller \"extras\" from the kitchen. Maybe things the chef is working on or something small created especially for you, but this was not the case at all. We paid 40 dollars more for only two extra courses. I felt a little cheated especially when I was told we would be trying a few things that the chef was working on.   On a bright note- the restaurant is an amazing space and wonderful atmosphere. The service was amazing. These things helped to make the night special. The food was very good. We enjoyed the soup and apps. I liked the duck more then my husband. We were served two poultry dishes which was disappointing especially when there was lamb and pork in the menu. The duck was excellent, the chicken was bland and very small. The potatoes, dispite the cheese, was nothing special.   For dessert we had the lemon tart and a small side of bread pudding. Both were nice, but not special. For a tasting menu we got some of the least expensive things on the menu, which was a disappointment.   The drinks and cocktails are fabulous! We enjoyed them very very much. However, the staff taking away half of our table during the meal was disruptive.   i dont know if back but if we do We will know next time not to pay more then the 25 or 30 dollars for the three course option."}
{"text":"Very personable service.  Great food.  Perfect lighting.  The ultimate trio."}
{"text":"The fact that I'm writing this review while still sitting at a table in Darwin should speak for itself. As like my previous experiences here, the food, drinks and service were impeccable.  We came to Darwin tonight- originally reserved for 4 but we came as 6 and they accommodated us without issue.  They had a birthday party that took up half the restaurant but that didn't stop them from giving us the golden treatment. The servers we had were beyond accommodating. They had a wine special on- $6 for a glass of Malbec but extended this to the 2 people at our table who chose to drink different wines.  We were treated to a delicious amuse bouche- a delightful plate of deep fried goodness. Our app ( we all opted for the same )- the shrimp and avocado was to die for. The mains- we had one of everything (except the duck since they were out of it). Every dish was enjoyed to the last bite.  But honestly, all of this aside, the service made the dinner for us.  Needless to say we will continue to return."}
{"text":"Great food and great service is what Darwin delivers on in abundance.  A bunch of friends and I visited this place last Friday and had one of our best dining experiences in a long time.  The food was impeccable and the service was 5-star amazing!  Food:  The shrimp avocado cocktail, which so many have commented on, lived up to the hype and then some.  Be prepared for well seasoned shrimps cooked to perfection placed on top of a bed of creamy seasoned avocados.  Yummy factor = 5 stars.  The curry mussels with fries were also done amazingly well.  The curry flavours were spot on and were well infused into the mussels.  The broth was so delicious that we devoured every last sip of it.  For the entrees, the majority of us ordered the steak frites and it was OMG good and priced at an unbelievable $25.  Think high class dining but a more down-to-earth price.  The 12 oz steak was grilled perfectly. But note that in order to  truly enjoy this dish there is some assembly required.  First apply a thin layer of the made-in-house tarter sauce that comes with the dish, then add a slice of the braised shallot, and then be prepared as your taste buds will be thanking you all night.  The combination of sweet, savoury and creamy came together in the perfect bit.  For dessert we had the bread pudding, creme brulee and lemon tart.  They were all great but the lemon tart blew me away.  The crust was so flaky and they managed to hit that magic ratio of sweet to tart.  You must order this dessert.  Service:  I have never had better service at a restaurant!  The waiter and the bar tender were like old friends and welcomed us like we were regulars.  We just hit it off with them and throughout the evening we were attended to with such care and passion - they truly made us feel like VIPs.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food,service and ambiance! There wasn't a huge menu but they didn't need one as it still had variety and everything they made was great! The service was impeccable, and they brought us out complementary appetizers. Good value for money. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I started with the avocado shrimp cocktail.   It had mangoes and coriander.  The avocado and mango combination was really new and interesting.  The flavour together tasted new and curious.  There was a bit of pepper in the avocado which gave it a bit of a kick.  The shrimp was perfectly grilled.  Lightly charred, crispy on the outside, but still juicy on the inside.  Hands down to perfectly cooked shrimp.  There was a bit of lime juice on the shrimp which brings out the freshness.  Overall, excellent dish.  I was impressed.  http://stellarperspectives.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/darwin/"}
{"text":"I've been to many chef tastings before they opened. They have a talented chef who does meats and fish very well. I recommend  starting off with their shrimp with avocado (very good), goat cheese tart or the delicious spicy tomato soup with chorizo. With the mains, you can't go wrong with the pork belly (tender), the aligot chicken (moist and comes with tasty cheezy mash), the lamb or even the fish (delicious eggplant puree).  Make sure to ask their awesome bartender for the maple old fashioned for yourself and a darwin martini for the lady. Cannot go wrong. A very decent additon to Little Italy's changing restaurant landscape."}
{"text":"It's a bistro, so the place is tiny. The bar has seating room for about 2 people. The decor is very classy and minimalist. Since two were already seated there, my date and I opted to sit at a table.  The waitress kept interrupting our conversation to persuade usto order,  and while that has happened before, I've never felt it was done in an annoying manner. I think she had good intentions, but mentioned she was bored, so she kept returning to our table and disrupted our conversation. Please train your wait staff! She was actually highly intrusive. They have a nice little cocktail menu, and I ordered the Orange Rum Sour. It was delicious.  The bartender was extremely polite, and came over to ask how our drinks were. It's a nice place for a date but I'm not sold."}
{"text":"We came here as a party of 10 for dinner and despite the place being small they actually took reservations.   I had the duck breast. It was only good but I hear from my friends that their steak frites were very good. The portion was also very generous. Not the same can be said about the duck breast though. I would try the steak frites or even the chicken next time as those were highly raved by a lot of here.   Because it was their first month in business, we also got complimentary champagne and the service was also very good and accommodating."}
