{"text":"I must say this is another of the numerous times that I am disappointed with the customer service in Montreal, but this time it was not only disappointing but also kind of insulting. 
We went with the Groupon offer to experience the Tapas tasting menu. I must say that the food is okay, but my reason for the 1 star review was the poor service we experienced. 

I have been in the restaurant business for 20 years and I understand how sometimes one single employee can ruin the reputation of a restaurant, and it shouldn't be that way. I write this review with the hope that the people that run the restaurant read it and acknowledge that the staff should treat the customers as their one and only priority, and that good customer service is the best way to get new referrals that will help grow the business. 

Montreal is a multicultural city and therefore, what a entree means to one culture could mean different to another culture. When I asked for the beef tartare, I had no idea it was made of raw meat, since in my country it is cooked. When I asked the waiter if he could change it since I had no clue it was raw, he just looked at me with a  bad expression and said \"somebody has got to pay for that\" in a very rude way. I had not even tried the tartare; I just asked if it could be exchanged. Then, when I asked if it could be cooked a little bit at least, he again gave me that same negative look and did not handle the situation with care and patience. When my boyfriend decided to eat it and try it, I assumed that was going to be the end of it, but it was not. The waiter stopped by again trying to blame us for our mistake, naturally making fun of us. He asked me if I wanted to see the menu again and I just said no. I did not even want to look at the guy. I had never been treated like that anywhere else. 

When he came with the bill, we saw the $4 dollars that we had to pay for the taxes, which was perfectly fine, but then underneath the total amount, there was this other handwritten amount (about $9). When we asked what that was for he said it was for \"the service\". I was really in shock and just wanted to leave that place. Since when do restaurants in Montreal add a handwritten and compulsory service fee to the bills? My boyfriend literally laughed out loud when he saw that. We paid and just left the place. We went to another restaurant and spent $50 in food that we could have easily spent at Cielo Tapas if we had been treated properly. 

I hope the service here changes and that customers get treated with respect. In the meantime, I just do not recommend the place, merely for the bad service that waiter provided."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero star rating to describe my restaurant experience at Cielo Tapas, I would.  I was so offended and taken aback that I created a Yelp account in order to warn others against being subjected to the same experience.

I stress that the food and atmosphere is nice (if that appeals to you) but the real killer was the atrocious service by our waiter (he said he was from Chile.). It truly ruined the evening and left us scratching our heads.

I came to the restaurant with my girlfriend with an offer from Groupon to try some of their specialty tapas.  Initially, everything was fine with an courteous female hostess  helping us to the table and trying to make us comfortable.  We then met the man who was going to spoil our night.

We were given a pair of menus with had absolutely no English on them; given as we don't know French, that posed a serious problem.  We muddled through the menus and ultimately, we ordered.  We asked for a pair of salads to start and then had a three different tapas to follow up, one of which was the beef tartare.

Initially, our waiter was courteous and we thought we had a relatively good rapport going.  Things all changed when we realized that the beef tartare had raw meat in it; as my girlfriend and I were uncomfortable eating that, we asked him if we could exchange it with something else.  He told us \"Somebody's gonna have to pay for that.\" At any other restaurant, they would have happily switched it with something else but no, not our waiter. We then asked if we could have it cooked or something but he just kind of looked at us like we were crazy.  Ultimately, I decided that I'd at least try it and not try to make a scene.

Unfortunately, this wasn't the end of things as he came back a few minutes later to essentially berate us.  He said that we didn't ask him for what was in it and made us feel like idiots: this is not how you treat customers...

At this point, we realized that we just wanted to get out of there ASAP.  So we essentially scarfed down our food, me stuffing my face with the tartare.  We finished as soon as we could and then asked to hostess for the bill.

When it came, there was the taxes for the Groupon, which I understood and then an additional $9.00 hand-written charge which I had no idea what it was for.  I asked my waiter and he said it was for \"the service.\"  I've heard of the tip being added in the case of a large table but I've never heard of it being added on a table of two.

The waiter had added it himself: the unmitigated gall of this man to be rude, berate and insult us and then expect a large tip.  I was so shocked by the whole experience that I actually paid it: I wanted to be out of there that bad.

We actually went to another restaurant after that and spent $50: that's money that we could have spent at Cielo, had we not been treated so poorly.

I can without a doubt that this is one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had and I will never go there again.  I recommend that the manager / owner take a long, hard look at this waiter and make the right call..."}
{"text":"If not for the disappointing desserts, I would have given 4 stars.

I went with a Groupon coupon tonight. The service was good and the quality of the food top notch. Everything was fresh, service attentive but not clingy.

The dessert was supposed to be a dessert of the day, the server advised was chocolate mousse. Not.

What arrived at our table was a 3\" x 3\" x 1\"  of chocolate cake (bought - not homemade). In what reality is that a value of $9? While the fried Gnocchi served with chocolate hazelnut sauce, sounded way more than it was, it was dense heavy and lackluster, they looked like 4 toasted marshmallows on the plate. We were pretty full so made no complaint.

Two of us started with Ceasar salad with pancetta and parmesan shavings, beautiful presentation, Caprini Salad - Mix of endives, pears, sundried tomatoes and goat cheese - looked better than it tasted, Caprese Salad- Sliced tomatoes with Buffalo Mozzarella - great eye appeal very subtle flavor.

Foie Gras was no way near as rich as I've experienced. Scallops au Pernod was subtle and fragrant - a delight. 
Duck carpaccio ($15 ) was surprisingly lean, still tasty.
Italian sausage - more of rolls of ground meat - with homemade dip ($9 ) 
Fried Calamari was a very generous portion.
Grilled garlic shrimp was served with a lemony sauce with chives? My friend short of licked it off the plate.
Lamb chops were juicy and not overcooked.

All-in-all a good time was had by all. We'd return with another coupon. This place is a bit pricey."}
