Trop cher, service long le midi

J'y ai été sur l'heure du lunch et l'endroit était particulièrement bondé. 

J'ai commandé les huitres qui étaient très bonnes. La présentation était très belle; les huitres sont placées un lit de gros sel. Mais n'étaient pas décollée du fonds... Une très bonne vinaigrette à l'ail était fournie. 

Le risoto était décevant, aucun légume, qu'un gros plat riz avec du homard sur le dessus... On s'attendait à plus.

Aussi, je suis tombé sur une huitre avariée. J'en ai fait la remarque à notre serveur et il m'a remercié du commentaire, mais sans plus. J'imagine que ça fait parfois partie des risques lorsqu'on commandes des huitres?

Le serveur visiblement débordé ne nous a pas apporté de pain et le service était très long. En attendant notre facture, nous commencions à perdre patience et j'ai remarqué que les gens des autres tables alentour étaient dans la même situation.

En résumé, je suis prête à réessayer le soir, mais le midi, le service est trop long et les plats sont trop chers pour ce qu'on retrouve dans l'assiette. Je ne parle pas de la quantité mais plutôt de la qualité et de l'expérience. Aussi, ne vous laissez pas berner par leur affiche \"À partir de 18 $ pour le midi\"; le seul plat à 18 $ c'est le boudin, les autres plats tournent alentour de 25 $, entrée et dessert compris.

Over-rated,  slow service during lunch hour
I've been there on lunch hour and the place was particularly crowded.I ordered oysters which were very good. 

The presentation was beautiful, the oysters are placed on a plate covered with coarse salt. But the flesh was not detached from the shell... A very good garlic dressing was provided.

The risoto was disappointing, no vegetables, a big bowl of rice with lobster on top.... We expected more.

Also, I came across a rotten oyster. I adviced  our server and he thanked me for the comment, but no more. I guess that is sometimes part of the risk when orders oysters?

Visibly overwhelmed the server did not bring bread and the service was very long. 
While waiting for our bill, we begin to lose patience and I noticed that people in the other tables where in the same situation.I

n summary, I am ready to try again in the evening, but at noon, the service is too long and the food is too expensive for what we find in the plate. I'm not talking about the quantity but the quality and experience. Also, don't be fooled by their poster \"Lunch starting at $18\", the only plate at $18 was the blood pudding, the other dishes were around $25, first course and dessert included."}
{"text":"Franchement décevant! J'y suis allée dans le cadre de l'événement Montréal à Table! Le service était plus que médiocre...30 min avant d'avoir un verre d'eau...bouteille de vin qui n'était toujours pas arrivée alors que nous avions terminé le plat principal. Le plat principal qu'on m'a servit était un saumon \"bouillit\" accompagné de ses légumes congelés et l'entrée un supposé gravlax de thon beaucoup trop raide. Le dessert était l'unique point positif de la soirée mais je suis loin d'avoir envie d'écrire une lettre à ma mère pour lui en parler! On ne m'a définitivement pas donné le goût de répéter l'expérience!"}

{"text":"We came here  for lunch expecting it to be awesome because it was pretty busy with lots of professionals eating under the sun, but the food is abysmal to say the least.

I ordered the table d'hôte and was pretty excited for my dishes to arrive. I decided to go for the watermelon gazpacho which was...just ok. For someone who loves watermelon beyond words (I could eat a whole melon in a day and forego any other food if you gave me the chance), I couldn't contain my excitement when my dish arrived, but seeing a pool of pink with a nice huge drop of oil swimming  in the middle was pretty unappetizing. Nonetheless, I assumed that it would be an awesome dish because...well...you can't really mess up anything with watermelon....but I was sadly mistaken. This was simply some blended and strained watermelon nearly flavourless with a tablespoon of unnecessary oil in the middle of it that didn't really serve to enhance the flavor, and so I didn't finish the dish and started getting nervous for my main.

The main was a chicken breast salad which I was also looking forward to. However, I think it's safe to say that this is the worst salad I've ever had. Sorry for the dramatic nature of this post so far, but really.. the WORST. First of all, it's just chicken on lettuce. No other vegetables. But, ok, I can look past that. A well cooked piece of chicken with vinaigrette will be good with good lettuce. So, let's break it down:

1. The chicken was FREEZING cold. I'm not talking about not warm because I don't expect warm chicken on my salads, but I mean right out of the top shelf of the fridge freezing cold. 

2. This freezing piece of chicken was undercooked as several pieces from the middle of the breast were pink or nearly red in color. 

3. Add to this the fact that the lettuce mix wasn't really fresh and ....

bammmm, you've got the worst salad on earth. 

The only good part of the table d'hôte/our entire experience and the reason for the 2 (instead of 1) stars was the amazing dessert which was a super intensely rich fudge brownie. 

Service was about a 5/10 with our waitress unable to speak a full English sentence and the food coming out pretty slowly. The bread basket also never came out till we asked mid-appetizer but that might be a money saving thing... 

In any case, don't waste your time or money here - really not worth it unless you're coming for some wine and that awesome brownie (or..several servings of it obvi :p)!"}
{"text":"Was there yesterday night for a business meeting and generally it's a nice place, service was good and generally diligent.

As an entree I went for a simple salad that had way too much oil and vinegar... a bit disappointing.
 
As a main course, I ate a nice piece of meat and the presentation was very nice on a wooden board... not a bad thing really.

Still I find myself wondering the cost associated for the meal and the lack of ahh generally.

Personally, I think you can find better at a lower cost for a similar meal; but nothing negative really. I'd be inclined to say that I'm left indifferent with this place."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this resto for a while. Saw it on the event \"Montreal a table\" so called to make a reservation. The food was not bad. I saw the less good reviews and couldn't really understand why. Maybe I am just lucky. This is the part about restaurant that is difficult to rate, the food quality that are not consistent. Service was so so, little slow at filling our glass of water. The place have very nice decor. Overall I like the experience. Hope it could keep up the good work not just for \"Montreal a table\""}
{"text":"Wow, quand même, un beau travail de rénovation de cette maison du tournant du XXè siècle en plein centre-ville. Beaucoup de monde au lunch, la nourriture était très bien sans trop sortir des sentiers battus, juste un peu originale. Prix corrects. Quand même pas en tête de liste pour essayer en soirée."}
