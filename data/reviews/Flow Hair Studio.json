{"text":"Katherine has been doing my hair for over a 3 years and absolutely an amazing stylist. I am beyond picky with who I select to get my hair done by...I am from New York so I am use to having a good stylist and I know the difference between having a person who knows what they are doing and those that don't. I know when I am being pressured into a test object and when someone really knows how to treat my hair and not just what they want to do to my head. I know when someone will say \"I understand you want to do this, but honestly as a stylist I cannot recommend this for your hair, you only doing damage\" and those professionals are very hard to find. 

I have had those bad experiences of people testing on my head as if I am a lab rat...

Well, look no longer because this young lady is amazing and you won't regret her taking care of you and doing a great job. 

She takes her time, she's respectful, she's professional and very welcoming. It's hard to find a good blow- out spot in Arizona, especially when you are use to a great NY blow out. Well, AZ folks, she is here. She started at NYC Salon in Mesa and now taking her Talent to a new spot. Give her your support, you won't regret the experience of the hands/salon.

Her hubby is also a Barber and in the salon as well. So if you have a hubby, child etc., one stop shop!

You want people that's loyal, that you can open up to, say things to that won't assume or take it personal. If you tell your stylist you don't want something done, it's not a pressure and they can say OK I won't do that! You want someone, that's professional at all time and that's open and honest with you, if you build professional relationship with...they can be open and honest at all times. You want someone that CARE your HAIR and not just style it or you becoming their test object or lab rat...YOU want a person that values your HAIR and CARE your HAIR!!!

I highly recommend her at all cost and on ALL LEVELS!!!"}

By appointments but it's always willing to work with you on scheduling as much as possible! Great atmosphere and multiple ways to pay (cc, cash, and pay apps)."}
