{"text":"Jesus!! You gotta eat here the food is amazing seasoned amazing and really authentic Mexican food! 

I'm a skeptic with places like this but HOLY! 

Get the carne Asada"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, decor is very vibrant. Staff is polite and friendly. Food is (what I think is) authentic, more than any other tap joints in airdrie that is for sure. I have returned there many times with my husband, even before they had a name change. It's a nice little \" hole in the wall \"."}
{"text":"I had heard about this spot...and everything people have said is true.   The food is amazing!    You have to get past where it is located, which is attached to a dumpy motel.   But you know what... it kind of feels like Mexico and the best food is in obscure places.   
I believe it is family run, based on the fact that the kids were there and just sitting down for a late lunch with family.   
Looks like they do takeout as many people were picking up food.    We sat down and had a quick lunch.  Tortilla soup was amazing and my husband had chicken mole.    Wow!    
It's worth trying out.   Airdrie desperately needs good restaurants... they have pubs and fast food.    This is amazing food and casual that you can take the kids and go in with flip flops.    They do serve alcohol.    Please try it... I want them to do well."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service very good, and the prices are extremely reasonable. I love Mexican food and I will definitely make sure to visit this restaurant regularly. Went with a group of 6 for my birthday and truly enjoyed ourselves and the food. Don't be deterred by the motel it's attached to, this is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican restaurant in Airdrie.  Food tastes great and the service are very friendly."}
{"text":"A MUST if you come to airdrie!! The best Mexican food I've had, sooooo amazing!! I've only ever ordered takeout so I can't comment on the serving experience but the owner is extremely friendly. The food is very authentic, I normally get the fajitas (honestly the best I've ever had) and the prensado tacos are also my favourite. Everything is made fresh and has unique Mexican flavours. This place is a hidden gem, a lovely small business that needs more attention, check them out!! you will not regret it :)"}
{"text":"Don't let the location of the little Mexican gem deter you. The food is absolutely authentic and so so so good. From the tv playing Mexican rock videos to the retro decor the place is a home run. 

The owners are super friendly and engaging. For Mexican food in Airdrie this HAS TO BE you go to location."}
