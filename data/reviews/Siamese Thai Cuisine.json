{"text":"Been coming here for three years great food. Love the calimari!!! Also recommend the mango chicken,spicy eggplant and veggie pad Thai."}
{"text":"I really love the food here, and I now know why. Simply Thai (Bloor and Runnymede) which was my go to for 15 years, shares the kitchen staff with this place.  Now I know why the green curry was so familiar and tasty!   The lunch special is superb, and very well priced.   Overall, I would say this place is one of the best in Vaughn for decently authentic Thai food.   ++ lots of good parking."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fantastic staff. Extremely good authentic Thai food. The staff really takes the attention to make your experience authentic. My go to place in Vaughan area for Thai! Don't second guess."}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING! I tried shrimp satay, 2 curries, mango salad, and chicken pad thai (with hot sauce). Everything home made. Family owned, the kids are adorable. Only complaint would be table cloths were dirty. It was late tho, they might have run out, but still. Amazing food tho. Price was good for eat-in, not take out."}
{"text":"The service here was great, and the staff are always friendly, but the food is just okay.  I always ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, and found it a bit bland and tasteless. The dish itself was very dry.  I would like to try some other dishes at this restaurant, so I may make a return visit in the future."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.   Visited this restaurant on Saturday evening (5:45pm) and it was completely empty. A few customers strolled in for take-out but it was pretty dead.   The food was meh, not authentic Thai food for sure. I ordered the prawn phad thai without bean sprouts, it came with bean sprouts (honest mistake I guess?). Dishes are on the pricier side.  Probably the first and last time I'd visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went: 6:00 pm Sat June 27 2015 (55/100) Ordered: Tiger Shrimp Satay (app) and Mango Chicken (main) Cost: incl. tax and tip $33 Comments: The peanut sauce that came with the satay was tasty. There were 4 skewers and every piece of  shrimp on each skewer was bland. The Mango Chicken was overly salty. We were eating without a lot of rice, but I'm sure if we ordered it in any other restaurant of this type, it would not have been as salty. We didn't even take the chicken leftovers home because of it. There were no chop sticks which sort of implied the restaurant might be catering to a more western palette. Bottom line: This restaurant was highly rated on TripAdvisor and I was disappointed. It might have been a bad day for the chef, but I won't be coming back. It might even deserve 2.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food! We tried the Fresh Roll, Mango Salad & Fish, Pad See Ew and the Tamarind Beef. I recommend all of these dishes and I can't wait to go back to try more! If you are looking for Thai food and you're in the area, you really should check it out."}
{"text":"The food is definitely worth it only if you have no limits on time.  We came in for their lunch special, and our entire hour was spent waiting for the food to come while another person that worked there or was the owner was just sitting down on this laptop while the waitress (who was really sweet) was running around.   Food is great, but the service is way below par. You're better off going the street for a quick lunch meal. Ended up cancelling the dessert and asking them to pack it up the main courses that were never brought out.   (We were seated at 1220, it's 1:17 and the only food that came out was our calamari & side of soup)"}
{"text":"Came to is place a few times, I must say its a hit or miss. Often when I do eat here, the atmosphere is nice and inviting, servers are nice, food is good, everything is great. Than the next time I pay a visit... It's like a whole new kitchen staff has been replaced, the food from good to not do great. The food can sometime taste like plastic? The chicken In my pad Thai became rubbery and uneatable.  I don't recommend this place at all, better luck at some next Thai restaurant   Good luck!"}
{"text":"Lunch special is best value in woodbridge.  Go with the mango salad as the hot and sour soup is not very good.  All of the mains are good."}
{"text":"I love their sauces! I love their pad thai. This is one of our favorite thai places near our house. Their lunch specials are such a great deal. I always get their fish with eggplant, pad thai, tamarind beef. My favorite is the fish and pad thai!"}
{"text":"Was craving for some thai food for lunch the other day and got some take out from them. I ordered the Panang Chicken  Curry and the Mango with Sweet Thai Sticky Rice. I am a fan of panang curry, I really like the creamy texture and the nutty peanut flavour. However, the Panang curry from this place is really different. The taste of it was more blend, and the curry was watery, not thick at all. It's almost like a soup, where you can drink it but you wouldn't be plunge with multiple of flavours. The Mango with Sweet Thai Sticky Rice was pretty good. The Mango was very sweet, the only downside was that the rice is on the hard side. If they can make the rice a little bit softer, this dessert would have been perfect."}
{"text":"It's a decent Thai place.   Probably the best Thai in Woodbridge but not so great compare to good Thai restaurants in the GTA   Better than All you can eat places but much room to improve.  For example, I could taste too much fish sauce in Mango salad and it wasn't ripe.  Half of them was still hard."}
{"text":"This place is amazing everything is delicious, i always go with the green curry and 2 spring rolls. I would recommend driving out of the city to eat at this hidden gem."}
{"text":"I love this place.   My standard order (even though I can never eat all of it) includes the Phad Thai with chicken (I ask for spicy without bean sprouts since they shrivel if you ever need to reheat); the Mango Fish which is fried and battered snapper with mango salad (excellent); as well as the Grilled Beef (Nue Yang) which I sometimes get two orders of so I can have one for myself and share the rest with my family  The Phad Thai is not as good as Salad King's but I suspect there is nowhere in Toronto or the GTA that is. The Mango Fish and the Nue Yang I could eat once a week.   I really wish I could pay a fee and have them teach me how to cook these dishes.  My only gripe with this place is they are not always open when they say they are going to be which can be very frustrating at times."}
{"text":"Went for the first time with a group from work.  Food was fantastic!   I had the Panang Curry with coconut rice and it was the perfect level of heat (for me).  Co-workers had the lunch specials: cashew nut chicken, pad thai and the green curry.  All were fantastic.  Lunch specials come with a spring roll, soup of the day or mango salad and are $10.00.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had the Satay chicken skewers, Shrimp Pad Thai, Basil Chicken Fried Rice and Fried Banana Fritters with Vanilla Ice Cream.   The Pad Thai dish was off and overpriced, not worth it imho.  The Skewers were ok but the sauce was weak.  Portions were small for a dinner menu.  Basil Fried Rice was very good but the thing that saved it for us was the desert.  The fried banana was the right texture and to die for, and they used a real banana leaf!"}
{"text":"Arguably, I have found the best Thai cuisine on this side of the GTA!  In an area more known for Italian, Siamese Thai Cuisine dares to make itself unique in the Vaughan/Woodbridge power centre of Highway 400 and Highway 7.   Finding myself here after a client meeting, I was greeted by today's host and waiter with a friendly smile who promptly offered me a drink when I sat down.   The decor, simple lines, with dark wooded accents.  The windows huge, bright and inviting, could have used curtains to set the mood a bit.  After a quick perusal of the menu, I decided to have the Thai iced tea with an order of the beef pad Thai for lunch.  The waiter quickly returned within minutes with my drink order and the accompaniment mango salad that I chose.     The mango salad was marvellous, topped with an in-house vinaigrette, some sweet onions, red peppers. The mangoes themselves were not overly ripen but just right, sweet and sugary to taste, like biting into al dente pasta.  I love mangoes so I had to slow it down as I eagerly save my palette for the main course.  When the pad Thai came a couple of minutes later, I quickly dived into the delicious hot plate of noodles set before me.  There was more beef than I expected, which is always a good sign.  A lime wedge was set as the garnish as well.  The noodles itself were cooked perfectly and seasoned to taste. It definitely is one of the better pad Thai I have had in awhile.  It wasn't overly greasy like some others, and definitely was not drowning in sauce.  The kitchen was on point with this plate of Pad Thai that I will definitely recommend others to try.  I loved that the dish was steaming hot, straight out of the kitchen made to order.  I savored every bite of the sweet and sour noodles, leaving barely any bits and pieces when all was said and done.    I saved some space for desserts and also tried their deep friend banana fritters, drizzled with a light honey sauce topped with sesame seed.  Ice cream is available with it but I opted out as I like my fried bananas with out.  Fragrant with vanilla, the dough hot and fresh made to order.  The dough covering the banana pieces were thin and not overly filling, just the way it should be for maximum enjoyment.  I ate 2 pieces while saving the 3rd for an afternoon snack.  I learned that they are currently under new management and that they have plans to renovate bringing the restaurant into modern times.  I look forward to it and have planned my return in the near future to try the other dishes on the menu!  Definitely check this place out when you're in the area, its delicious home comfort Thai food!"}
{"text":"Great place for tasty Thai north of Toronto.  Definitely a notch above your usual takeout."}
{"text":"This place has amazing Thai food that I ever eat. The pad thai I ordered is tasty,sour and sweet enough. My sister had Tamarin Beef. The lunch special also offer you a spring roll or soup or mango/apple salad. In addition,the waitress is super nice to both of us.It was pretty good experience"}
{"text":"It was good, but portions were a little small and it's pricier than a lot of other Thai places in the area. Found it to be a little bland."}
{"text":"I rated it a two, because the service was better than the food.  I was expecting a lot from the food, considering the reviews I read, and the prices.  They are pricier than my usual Thai place, and I expected something reasonably good.  The fresh rolls are served like sushi rolls, cut into pieces.  I suppose this is to mask the fact that they charge $8 for fresh rolls, and they are equivalent to less than two rolls at my regular place, which charges $3.50.  The fresh rolls had a lot of carrot, which I thought was unusual for the price.  Many of the usual vegetables found in fresh rolls were missing.  My wife ordered the basil chicken, and I ordered ginger chicken.  My meal was hugely salty, due to what seemed like heavy use of soy sauce, instead of a more sophisticated cooking.    My wife had to send her dish back to the kitchen, because it was so spicy.  They \"fixed\" it, and it tasted more Asian afterwards, kind of lice licorice, I guess.  Not sure how that is \"basil\" though.  I suffered through my dish, although in retrospect I should have sent it back as well.  The waitress was very nice about it, and we were happy with her service.  Restaurant management did not apologize, or say anything when they brought the bill.  I went to the back to pay, and there were a few people standing around, they just took my payment, and didn't say anything or even ask again how the food was.  Needless to say, this is a never return."}
{"text":"Uber Eats wouldn't take the order so I called in. The fellow took my order, and told me it would be ready in 20-25 minutes. I drove over and arrived at 20 minute mark. The fellow said it would be a few more minutes. I said ok, and sat down. 20 minutes later I asked what was up with my order. They said it would be a couple of minutes more. I waited over ten minutes more and they finally came out with my food. When I got back to the office, one of the food items was wrong, and the portion sizes were small.  He apologized, but no discount or extra dish was offered to compensate the extended wait. And then to get the order wrong. Sigh.  The only thing that saved the experience is that the food tasted good. Too bad. My next time I'm going somewhere else."}
{"text":"AMAZING lunch deals!!!!  I'm not leaving Toronto go to to this place for lunch or anything, but if you work in the area, this is a great option (even for vegetarians!!!). All lunch specials come with spring roll, mango salad or soup!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a decent option for lunch.  Lunch specials tend to fall around $10-$11 per person, and includes a side, either a salad or spring roll.  The restaurant is clean and inviting, it's usually not busy when we go during the week at lunch time so we've never had to wait for a table. It is a bit hidden in a plaza next to Pie, the pizza restaurant.   The plaza has lots of free parking out front.   The food isn't bad, certainly not the best i've ever had. I have tried the pad-thai, green curry, spring rolls and mango salad and I find everything to be on the sweet side. The pad thai sauce is really very sweet, I generally need some hot sauce to tone it down a bit, and the dipping sauces and salad dresses I also find to be almost too sweet. I had the mango salad for lunch which is around $10 and when she put it on the table in front of me, I thought it was for one of my colleagues who had a side portion of the salad with her lunch, it's definitely not worth $10, it's pretty much just a sliced mango, shredded carrot, a few small pieces of red pepper, onion and around 4 cashews on a plate. The dressing again was really sweet which added no contrast to the sweet mango.  The portion sizes are OK for lunch, not ideal for a big eater however.   There are other Thai restaurants in the area with similar menus but larger portion and a bit less expensive.   The service is always nice and everything always comes out quickly and without any errors.   Otherwise, not my favourite thai restaurant in the area, mind you I've only had a few of the lunch dishes, maybe it's better for dinner!"}
{"text":"What I thought would be a good experience I was quite disappointed. Apps started out good but then we found glass in our soup. Furthermore I was VERY disappointed to be seeing the serving staff drinking alcohol whilst on the job...contributing factor to glass in our soup? Would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3/5 and maybe 4/5 for some people. The food is tasty and the portions are reasonable. I ordered stir fry beef and the girl serving us was very friendly and helpful. They offer curries, stir-fry, soups and noodle dishes. You won't be constrained by the choice. They even offer an omelet on top of your Pad Thai which is not on the menu, but something I usually like to order at Thai restaurants.  If I'm craving Thai food and happen to be Vaughan, I'd probably come back to this place.  The only thing I absolutely HATED was the loud music appropriate for a nightclub, but not a restaurant. They'd benefit from playing either traditional Thai music or ethnic Lounge music like they do at Buddha Bar chain of restaurants in Paris, NYC, Dubai and others."}
{"text":"Waited 1 and 1/2 hours for food and in the end walked out. Never go to this poorly run establishment. ( I would give this a zero rating if it was an option )"}
{"text":"2.5 Star  I love Siamese Thai's Friendly and courteous service with a smile!   However the food was just so so...  Lunch Special Weekdays till 3 pm. I ordered Chicken Thai Spicy Noodle with a side Mango Salad ($8.95).  Mango Salad needed some more herbs and dressing to add more taste. Quite a few piece of mango was so riped and mushy which I just could not made myself to eat that. Chicken Thai spicy Noodle requested extra spicy was pretty good, I do love all those fresh basil leaves used.  That white thick plastic table cloth was dirty and sticky, maybe it is to replace them to something else?!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out over all of the great reviews. I was looking for an alternative to my usual Thai place (Our Thai.) Which we used to frequent every Tuesday without fail. The interior of Siamese Thai Cuisine is semi renovated; sans for the peeling wallpaper in the booth we were in. The servers were quite friendly, albeit Missing in Action for periods of time (just too fast to catch.) -- my boyfriend and I each ordered a pad thai, he got the chicken with a mango salad, and I got the tofu with a spring roll. My first spring roll was unfortunately, still frozen. Which I didn't initially notice because I assumed that the bed of noodles it was resting on were cold...you can imagine my surprise when I realized, no, these are crispy noodles and this spring roll is still frozen. Which as you can imagine, was very off putting. The waitress seemed alarmed and rushed off with the spring roll; I fully expected a manager to come over and apologize for the mishap, but no such thing happened. 10 minutes later, a new spring roll was brought over, this time fully cooked. The pad thai was decent, although I did ask for mine to have spice added to it (there was none.) My boyfriend mentioned wanting some Sriracha to add some heat, but we couldn't find our waitress...or anyone really, so we just ate, paid and left (this was still a 10-15 minute waiting ordeal.) I'm not sure I'll be back again; have to see how I feel in a few months."}
{"text":"I go to Thai Bamboo a lot and today I wanted to try another place. TB is my yardstick for any Thai place but last time I didn't like their service so I decided to try something else. I ordered my usual dishes - pad Thai and peanut chicken. The food tasted ok. The flavour was not that memorable. I have had better Thai food elsewhere. It's a bit more expensive than TB. I will not go back."}
{"text":"My cousin suggested this place a while back. This will be my third time here and I have not had one bad meal yet. The staff are very courteous and the food is good. I always have the Thai green curry and a mango salad. Gonna try the pad Thai next. I am never disappointed :)"}
