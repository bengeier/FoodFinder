{"text":"I should have gone to the Japanese place across the road. I had to grab a quick to go lunch here and nothing was good except the wontons. My egg rolls were soggy and the General Tso's was unrecognizable. I threw it our and got LJS 5 minutes down the road. Also a few months back I had the short ribs and they tasted like plastic."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and the person taking the order was pretty rude. After ordering over $50 worth of food, but forgetting one of items they accused us of lying when we called and told them about it. The delivery was pretty fast and the guy was polite. I've tried another Chinese place nearby and it's much better."}
{"text":"No real dining room. Food is always good though and service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Food always good. Just wish they brought back the old way of making dumplings. They were the only things I craved."}
{"text":"I Have been to this restaurant on 3 count them 3 different occasions; the first time the food was tolerable. Times 2&3 yuck. The hot and sour soup had an over abundance of oil in it it was disgusting. The chicken and broccoli was so so. The beef and vegetables was to salty. Cashier very rude answers phone while taking in store order and will service phone customers before she completes your order.  Just plain rude!!!  Lastly, not the cleanest either thank goodness my boyfriend always paid. Way way slummier than the photos suggest."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here no.1 they were late (they told me 45 of course) but anyways I ordered crab Rangoon and dumplings. Crab Rangoon was mushy and the dumplings usually come with sauce * didn't get that I usually love this place but didn't meet the usual expectations"}
{"text":"Solid Chinese.  This location is in Penn Hills near Rodi Road. They offer all of the typical favorites. Mine are their fried wings and their pork lo mein which you can get in up to 32oz., which is enough for at least three meals. Their egg rolls are equally tasty. My wife gets the Szechan Beef. It is just as good.   Everything is cooked to order so it is best to call ahead if your order is to go. They deliver as well.  Drinks are in the cooler and range from different pops to teas. The space is quite small, but there are a few tables should you want to dine in.   For desert, try the newly added donuts. They are amazing."}
{"text":"The food here used to be incredibly phenomenal back over 10 years ago when it was run by a husband and wife team. Ever since they moved and sold it, the quality of the food has waaaaaay down hill. On the rare occasion that I do order, I get a young kid with attitude taking my order, and everything tastes like generic bland mall food sauce that is entirely too salty.   For instance, one major selling point for me was that this place made their own dumplings. The other month when I ordered them, they were clearly the frozen type that you can get in any freezer section. I swear all dishes are cooked in the same three sauce categories, and delivery time can sometimes be outrageous. This place is just not good. Head across the street and grab some quality Japanese food from Tsuki before you give this place your money."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast delivery of good Chinese food in Penn Hills or Verona, this is it. They give you large portions, packaging is nice, and the price is unbeatable. My family ordered Sweet & Sour Pork, General Tso's Chicken, short ribs, pork fried rice, and some sort of sesame beef. Everything was really good and there was enough for a big dinner and a very filling lunch for three adults and one child."}
{"text":"Slow service for carry out. Was told 25min for carry out and I waited an additional 25 minutes when I arrived."}
{"text":"Great customer service, great price for such large portions, delicious Chinese and speedy service!!!"}
