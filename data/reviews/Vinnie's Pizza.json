{"text":"This place is great. True NY style hand tossed pizza right here in Peoria. Generous toppings and quality meat when we ordered sausage and pepperoni. The calzones are great and the pizza & wing specials are reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food. Now that they've been open a while and have their own sign on the building, Vinnie's is rolling along! Lunch specials and pizza by the slice is great too. Not something you find too often in Arizona."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Really good garlic cheese bread. Generous portions for an outstanding price. The owner took my order and he was extremely nice. He made sure to double check the order over the phone to make sure it was accurate. The wait was normal. Only 20-25 he said for pick up. I'll definitely be returning there whenever I want pizza!"}
{"text":"Awesome New York style pizza best I've had since I've been back to the Big Apple. Price is very fair and the service and staff are very friendly. Today was the first time I went there and I'll be going back on a regular basis. Great food at a very reasonable price is hard to find."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for NY/NJ style pizza. Vinnies is the closest thing!! Staff is friendly, the pizza is amazingly good, priced fairly. I'm a pepperoni girl, but I have tried and LOVED the sausage and also the chicken teriyaki pizzas. This seriously beats the competitors in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome pep and jalepeno slice. Crust just right amount of crisp and cheese melts in mouth. A must stop for just a slice or whole pie."}
{"text":"wings are excellant.  pizza flavor very good..  didn't care for the garlic knots.  gave us a free pizza on cardinal game day.  nice people"}
{"text":"I stop here every time I take my car in for service at Kia just down the street.  Nice place to wait and eat.   Mozzarella sticks are the BEST. Chef salad was good.  Didn't get the pizza.  My son loved the Chicago style hotdog. Will keep coming here."}
{"text":"Great food and even better people! A huge improvement over Fuzzys. The veggie pizza was amazing, and wings were fantastic. Will definitely be coming back. It's a breath of fresh air having a great pizza joint in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"OHH! Forgetaboutit!  This is the real dealyeeo.  Great pizza, italian beefs (BOOM), chicago dogs!  If you haven't made it out this diamond in the rough, put it into your gps and head down there right now, tell them Stan The Man sent you!  OH!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant! They deliver which is so convenient during my work hours, amazing customer service, and you cannot get better prices! It means we can purchase more on their menu to try all of their wonderful items! THANK YOU VINNIE'S PIZZA :D"}
{"text":"Love the Garlic and Cinnamon knots! Combination pizza is delicious and the atmosphere is relaxed. I have lunch there and my employer buys loads of pizza for when we have work functions!"}
{"text":"Went here after it changed ownership the third time. Pretty good Pizza and my dad loves it. When we placed our order they gave us cups to get drinks while we waited and then when it was ready gave us free garlic knots. Above and beyond and good homemade pizza. Love the sausage too."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time when it was Fuzzy's.  I would always order the Italian Beef. It reminded me of when I grew up in Illinois. Exact same flavor. Amazing. It is now under new ownership and instead of being Chicago style it is now New York style. They kept the Italian Beef sandwich though. They told me the recipe was the same but it does not taste the same. You only get half the meat and it is dry. Yuk. It is supposed to be simmering in the broth which gives it its flavor. They also changed the style of bread it is served on. Attention: don't sell a Chicago style sandwich in. New York style restaurant. I will not be returning. New York style pizza are a dime a dozen. Chicago is few and far in between."}
{"text":"Since this establishment is close by, my family and I felt like trying it out. First of all, I ordered the veggie pizza without onions, but when I got home found out they put the onions on anyway. There's strike one for an incorrect order. Next, my family isn't very partial to cheddar cheese on pizza, and one of my sons even grew up with a slight intolerance to it, so it would be nice if they labeled the types of cheese used on their pizzas. Another point about the toppings: use fresh ingredients, not canned mushrooms! I also ordered cinnamon knots, but were surprised when we actually received doughy, oily garlic knots instead. Strike two on an incorrect order. Hoping that their pasta wouldn't be bad as well, we then went on to try the \"baked\" ziti. Unfortunately, an alright pasta was covered in completely bland tomato sauce (I wouldn't even call it a marinara) and essentially no cheese at all. Also, it wasn't baked, hence the quotations. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing NY  style pizza. I'm literally in heaven. After 10 years in AZ, I finally found true NY pizza. Any east-coasters gotta try it!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Came here to kill some time while getting my car serviced next door and I am glad that I did. Pizza is more delicious than it looks, pretty hard to do when the pizza looks really delicious. Must try the garlic pizza!!! Great service and delicious food... what more can you ask for??! I highly recommend Vinnie's Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"This was the location of the original Fuzzy's Pizza which was outstanding! Gave it a try. Its pretty good. Worth a try"}
{"text":"Wow!   We were visiting from California and had a late night craving for pizza.  Checked out a place close by but wasnt too crazy about paying $12 for a 12\" pizza. Came across Vinny's  and saw they sold pizza  by the slice.  Here we Are!  Wow!  2 slices plus a drink for $3.99!  $10.00 for 2 people!    Slices are HUGE, hot and delicious, and not too greasy!   Server was a doll!  Very friendly folks and fast service.  Cant rave enough about this place.  Only sorry they don't have a Vinny's back home!"}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE Vinnies pizza!!! Not only is the pizza the best in Arizona (it really is), the staff always goes above and beyond to make you feel like a valued customer. When you walk in, you really feel like it is \"your\" pizza joint. I love the thin crust and huge slices. If you haven't tried it, I really recommend you do!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Had pizza and wings delivered three times last week! They have a great deal right now: $20 for a large, 1 topping pizza, 12 wings and garlic knots.   Pizza isn't overly greasy like some places in this area. I always get pepperoni so granted it will have a little. They use quality cheese and that makes a huge difference!   I've gone in there a few times and the staff is always nice. Delivery drivers are cool too!"}
{"text":"It's not surprising to me to hear this place's original location is known as the \"Best Pizza in Cottonwood Arizona\" because Cottonwood isn't exactly a mecca for great pizza or food.   The most honest review I could give this place is that I think they should have taken their time and not rushed so quickly to open. They just don't seem ready and polished at this point.  I really loved Fuzzy's, and am sad to see them go. Because I live right across the street, I will keep giving Vinnie's another try until they truly disappoint me, but so far everything I've gotten from here has been decidedly \"meh\"."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a new place for good pizza since our Red Devil closed. Finally found it! Good pizza, friendly staff, quick service, and they even threw in some garlic knots!  So happy we found this place and even better that we get to support our neighborhood small businesses."}
{"text":"If you think your calling Fuzzys your not.  Same number as they took over Fuzzys  and the phone was answered with \"please hold\" ... Not thank you for calling Vinnies. We ordered our regular Fuzzys thin crust (thinking we were calling Fuzzys as usual!) and thought all was good until the pizza was delivered.  It was not thin crust or cut in Fuzzys squares..that was our first clue..when I called to tell them the crust was wrong, I was informed they were no longer Fuzzys and they didn't have thin crust...  Only hand tossed. Oh really???  You would think that at least the phone would be answered \"Vinnies\" to let people know they are no longer Fuzzys... Also why not tell us when we ordered thin crust that they don't have it? The pizza was cold and the crust was not cooked all the way and tasted like raw flour...yuck!  The sauce tasted like spagettios... Yuck! They even forgot the requested crushed pepper.  Fuzzys thin crust and great sauce will be missed...  As for Vinnies...I thought it was very misleading and I was very disappointed with the pizza.  If I could ask for my money back I would."}
{"text":"The cheese on the pizza was different than what Im used to.  Pizza slices was soft & limp.  The garlic knots were tough and the hot wings were not hot flavored at all.  There was not an option to order beverages on GrubHub.  It was okay but I wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. However,  I was incredibly disappointed.   We ordered the white pizza, wings, garlic knots, chicken strips and meatballs. My son liked the chicken and meatballs, but the rest was horrible. The wings were dry and flavorless. The crust of the pizza was ok, but the sauce tasted funny. The garlic knots were ok but I'm not sure why there was sesame seeds all over them and the pizza crust.   They did deliver quickly but I'm upset that I spent $40 on food we won't even eat."}
{"text":"We Especially love the pepperoni thin crust pizza. The restaurant provides a small but nice outdoor eating area. Inside is comfortable as well . We always enjoy grabbing a slice during the week. Delivery is available as well. Delicious pizza and we always recommend it to our friends. The people who work here are friendly and efficient. Thanks Vinnie's!!"}
{"text":"I've been there a ton of time and I always get the same thing, an Italian beef with everything. It's amazing and life changing but be careful it will ruin you for all other Italian beef sandwiches!"}
{"text":"The customer service is unparalleled. Let me give you an example. Vinnie's closes at 8:00 on Mondays but I did not know this when I called at 7:55 to place a pick up order. When I got there at around 8:15 I learned that the restaurant had actually been closed for 15 minutes but you never would have guessed. The employees were happy, not watching the clock or grumbling about customers like me keeping them there late, and the music was still playing, lights were on, chairs were not put up on tables...it looked and sounded like an open restaurant. Then, as I was paying, 2 customers walked in ready to place an order. They were welcomed, not turned away. It was now almost 20 minutes after closing and the staff were AMAZING. I have never had such delightful service and I'm so happy I stumbled upon this place.  Now for the food: I have yet to have a bad meal here. The wing flavors are delicious, my favorite being hot. The pizzas are great too, and a GREAT value! You would be surprised how much food you get for the same price you pay at other places in the vicinity. My favorite pizza is the white vegetarian. It's SO good! If you haven't eaten here yet, why are you waiting?"}
