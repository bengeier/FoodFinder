{"text":"Have been here several times. Always has been a good meal. Staff are very friendly. The only problem is that it takes too long to get there from the East End of Pgh."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  I've only eaten in, so I have no feedback on delivery, but I've always been happy.  The signage and decor is something you'd expect to see in an old episode of the A-team but the place is clean and the food is good.  The portions are big and the prices are very reasonable.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  I've usually been there on weekends around lunchtime and the restaurant is always nearly empty.  I hope for their sake it is busier at other times, because it really is good food."}
{"text":"I read almost all of the reviews before deciding to visit.  Recurring in the reviews was the phrase \"hole in the wall' type place.  I mistook that to mean 'quaint' or 'unnoticed local gem'.  Now I understand what that means.  It means an accident that happened to something that once before was stable and good.

I visited here at 6:30 p.m. on a Saturday night.  There are  about 20 seating options, 3 were used all the others empty.  First sign I chose to ignore.

The interior looks like a frozen- in- time 1970's steak house.  Nothing updated, nothing new, nothing fresh.  Second sign I chose to ignore.

The waiter, a retired white man working on some secondary income source to supplement his retirement, attended to us.  He was loud, very loud.  He was not Asian.  White, and very loud. There was no Asian table or house workers in the front side of things.  Third sign I chose to ignore.

The food was basic stuff....beef and broccoli and a honey - spicy chicken.  Nothing special in flavor or presentation.  All served on old plates with big metal lids.  Perhaps leftovers from the 1970 steakhouse sale.

I sent all the food back shortly into the meal because it was cold.  The rice was cold, the meat and veggies were cold and even the soup broth was cold.   When was the last time you ate Chinese food that was cold?  It's never cold, never.  This was.   I couldn't ignore that.

The bill for two dinners, with soup and 4 spring rolls was $54 with tip.  Waaaaaaay beyond what I would ever pay again for a run down dining room that served cold, mediocre food  There are plenty of other places out there. 

Don't choose to ignore this review.  You heard it from me.  Not what you want."}
{"text":"This has been our go to place for Chinese food, mostly because we support family run businesses, and because it's good. The whole family is friendly, and welcoming, and their various dishes have been hits. My favorites have been their Szechuan spicy tofu, Beef Broccoli, and their beef fried rice. They have one of the better tasting Hot and Sour soups in the area, and their steamed dumplings are tasty, filled with a ground pork mixture, and if it's not pork, it's still tasty!

Most of our orders are take out, but they do offer free delivery. Getting into and out of the parking lot can be tricky, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall. Honestly, it looks like they use the dining room as their living room. Its very cute. Very quaint.

The waitress is named Kitty. She is sweet as sin. She's not terribly fast but she is terribly nice. She makes sweeps through  the dining room with a push cart, dropping off tea and soup in large batches.

We showed up right at the tail end of six tables all being seated at once. Plus two other tables sat down after us. Honestly, my first suspicion was that this meal would be a suckfest, it would take forever, and the service would be awful. I was pleasantly surprised.

We ordered some chow mein and this shrimp dish. Plus we got soup, egg rolls and tea. Kitty took turns through the dining room. First she brought everyone tea. Then came our soup. And finally the egg rolls. My girlfriend said the wonton soup was the best she had ever eaten. I commented that she says that every time she gets wonton soup. This soup was tasty, don't get me wrong. But it was nothing special. You got two chubby little wontons and some pieces of char siu. It was quite good for 85 cents. The egg rolls were pretty ordinary, too. They had decent sized shrimps in them.

For the entrees, the chow mein we got was delicious. The sauce was a simple brown sauce. There was ALOT of beef in it. The beef had a rich, beefy taste and wasn't tough. In addition to the beef, there was tons of celery in it. All in all, quite tasty. The portion wasn't very huge...but neither was the price.

The shrimp dish was pretty much in the same brown sauce. I forget the name of the dish but I think it was like Va Que Shrimp or something. The restaurant prides itself on Cantonese specialties. This was one of them. Its basically several fresh veggies in a brown sauce with several fried shrimp added at the end. Much like the chow mein, it was simple. It was a small portion but, again, the price was small, too.

This is one of the things I like the best about this place: the price! This place is super cheap! We ordered two entrees, soup, tea and egg rolls and it was $16! This is amazing. And you'd think the food would be gross or the service would be shit....but not here....

The portions are smaller because the price is smaller. This might make some people upset but to me this means two people can try three things or a family of four can try five or six things. The quality doesn't suffer, either.

The only complaints is that they neither had a high chair or a booster seat for our 2 year old. Also, they do not take credit.

If you don't mind the setting, and I don't...its cute, then this place is pretty rad. Good, cheap American Chinese food served by a super nice lady, can't get much better than that, can it?"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for several years,  horrible disappointment.   Chix with garlic sauce had no taste.  Egg rolls, wonton soup were not good.  All in all.....will not go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. 

I frequently have Silver Palace deliver food to me and I have dined in before. 

I love the food (especially the curry chicken) and the staff is genuinely friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. The staff is so welcoming and friendly. The hot tea is yummy and they are very generous with the rice, which pleases me. This is one of the few Chinese restaurants where the General Tso's chicken is labeled spicy and actually tastes spicy. It's good! I've also tried the curry chicken, which very much lives up to its name. I love that their dishes have plenty of sauce and the portions are quite large. I love coming to this restaurant. On another note, they have an adorable sink in their women's restroom.

eta: Eat the duck sauce. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Best Crab Rangoon! Haven't had a bad meal from there yet. Fast delivery."}
{"text":"Fair at best. Smallest buffet I have ever seen. Not enough buisness to keep food fresh or hot"}
{"text":"We love this place. The staff have become like friends to us. They're always so gracious and attentive and the food never seems to take too long. The spring rolls have shrimp in them but they're great- not greasy and packed with veggies. I usually go with the kung pao or garlic chicken and it is always way too much food. Sit-down dinner quality at cheap delivery prices."}
{"text":"We are from markham ontario, where authentic chinese food is a staple and easy to come by. Went with family of 7 for dinner. From all the great reviews, we expected a chinese menu but was not presented with one. Disappointed at this, a Chinese server greeted us very nicely and offered to make what we would normally eat. Stone pot tofu, steamed fish, yu choy with oyster sauce, and garlic onion. The result: Much better than we expected from a town with less Chinese restaurants than our hometown. This place tasted like home.
Had Good tea too.

Price: we ordered 4 large dishes , 3 large bowls of rice. 7 satiated bellies. Bill came out to about 65.

Bottom line: Excellent bang/buck for authentic Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"A great hole in the wall restaurant. I've been coming here with my friends for years since high school. The food is delicious and fairly priced. The owners are very friendly and welcoming. I have no idea what the previous reviewer is talking about because there is no buffet at Silver Palace."}
{"text":"We got takeout from here yesterday for the first time in a little while, and the food was as good as I remembered it. It's comparable to the Tong Garden in Brookline. My favorites are the General Tso's Chicken, the pan fried dumplings, and the beef fried rice. If you like Chinese food, this is a reasonable little place to try in the South Hills."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for as long as I can remember. Its a family-run type of place. I remember when one of the owners was newly married - then pregnant - then her son was running around the restaurant - and then he was server - then he did deliveries....  Its kind of nice to see a family business like this. Its not too common anymore!

The food is actually really good!! I love Chinese food and always try to go get chinese food from unique places and this place is on par with some of the best I've had in San Francisco and Chicago's China Town areas. 

The shrimp in lobster sauce is amazing. :) 

They have a private parking lot and are very easy to find, its an old converted brick house right on 88. Enjoy!"}
