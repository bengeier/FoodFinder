{"text":"Love love love this place!  Great new items, odd finds you cant get anywhere else! And he best awesome sushi bar with the best prices and fantastic sushi chefs! Everyone is so nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer and wine selection.  I love that you can buy a single bottle of beer - if you want to just try something out, you don't have to commit to a six-pack.  Great prepared foods section - I had a hard time choosing between a sandwich, soup, build-your-own salad, pizza, and sushi (just to name a few of your options.)  I opted for the sushi and was not disappointed.  Fresh fish made to order.  I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I usually come here to grab a quick lunch from the salad bar or deli. The deli area sometimes gets crowded and if numbers aren't taken it can get kind of hectic. I love their salads and soups but I do not love the employees working there. Multiple times I have encountered rude employees at the deli counter when ordering something as simple as an iced tea. I'm a friendly polite person so it throws me off when someone gives me attitude for ordering an iced tea with lemon.... That's all...."}
{"text":"There's a big sign saying Hand Crafted Coffees on a sandwich board over the Bakery/Coffee (and Teas) area.  Now, doesn't the genteel phrase \"hand crafted\" mean to you roasting awesome coffee in batches made to your personal specifications?  Isn't it a place for bean-savvy sophistication?  Or, at the very least they'll make your coffee the way you'd like to drink it?  Let me say that my \"Carl's Jnr\" coffee from Phoenix the previous day was better, cheaper and served by a happier, friendlier employee glad to see us in her store.  

I was not asked my choice of milk.  The very skinny and very tall female employee gave me two percent Shamrock milk.  I noticed it wasn't my usual so asked for skim.  Her response was to toss out the coffee from the paper cup and refill the same cup with coffee and skim milk.    

Were I not concerned for the environment, I might have asked her for a clean cup, too.  I don't want fattier milk and her chucking things around is certainly no Fine Food and \"hand-crafted\" experience.  It showed reflection of attitude to this customer's very simple request.

I was too afraid to speak for I thought I'd darken her day further and that she might end up screaming at me.  I have no idea what personal calamity she had experienced prior to me ordering my coffee but she looked angry, miserable and I must add has been unfriendly every other time I've purchased something at the bakery and tea/coffee department there.   

It's at least three different times that I've had a bland coffee at this purveyor of fine foods and several made with this female employee so I feel it's fair to suggest to Yelpers to go to the nearby \"Barnes & Noble.\"  You will have a happier day and most certainly a better coffee experience.  I'll add that I'm very surprised others who take coffee haven't complained about the staff.  The older woman who didn't serve me on this occasion looked unhappy as well.  I'd walked past the open staff room on the way to the restrooms.  There's a sign there stating \"Effort not Excuses\".  Perhaps this should be brought to the attention of this section's staff?  

I'll finish on a positive note in saying that other staff from other areas don't give out such negative vibes and actually offer to help you when you're walking past."}
{"text":"I just don't understand why its so overpriced, $8-$13 for a box of cookies, come on now."}
{"text":"I love this AJ's! The staff is always very nice ad they have an AWESOME sushi bar. The fish is always extremely fresh and their portions are plentiful. This is a great place to grab lunch if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I was in Gilbert for an interview last Monday, June 4th and after the interview, the other candidates and I decided to visit AJ's Fine Foods.  Wow! This was my first visit and I was quite impressed with the whole place!

Very clean, outside and inside.  The ambiance is quite relaxing. Perhaps it's because I love the sound of water (fountain)

Then as we walked in, wow!  I became more impressed with the selections of EVERYTHING.  I ended up just buying a chicken green chile tamale, which I absolutely enjoyed.  It was cold but the staff offered to warm it up for me  :)  That was great!

I just adored that place a lot.  Next time I'm there I'll be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"Oh how I LOVE taco Tuesday! Though the price is a little high, these are the best tacos I've ever had."}
{"text":"Similar to other bad experiences.  Didn't feel welcome in the store.  Made it as far as the bakery when baker-service-person came around, reached around us (with nary an \"excuse me) grabbed a cake and went into the back.  No \"hello\" no \"be right with you.\"  After feeling ignored for long enough we just left.  Can find what we need at plenty of other places in any event."}
{"text":"Great food, free samples, and extremely knowledgable and helpful staff."}
{"text":"One of the best stores for great tasting produce.  When I first moved here from CA, I couldn't find any produce that tasted this good until I found Aj's.  That was what kept me coming back.  Then I discovered their wine selection and then the veggie wraps!  Cashiers are polite and the manager is always there to help and is very pleasant.  This has become one of my favorite places to relax (outside with coffee) then go shopping in their interesting store."}
{"text":"Well, came in to try out the Reuben sandwich. The name itself sounds pretty good. It came to the point that I was a little disappointed. I wanted my sandwich hot and guess what I got? Warm sandwich. The corned beef and Swiss cheese was already prepped in their fridge. I was expecting fresh cut from the deli machine. The sauerkraut came from a small packet, not fresh. The guy probably only toasted the bread for a minute so it's not toasty. The corned beef was a little salty for my opinion. Definetely not getting that again. 
On the other side, you get a small side order of anything as long as $7.99 and below. I got the cucumber and tomatoes that was soaked on oil ( not sure what kind of oil) so it was kinda mushy. I didn't really liked it but I ate it coz I was hungry lol. 
I think the best part was the small dark chocolate that they give you for free. I love dark chocolate so that's a plus. 
Overall, was ok. That sandwich cost me $9 doesn't come with any drink. Oh well!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of AJ's although I admit I'm used to going to the ray rd location in Chandler. I regularly go for lunch for soup and salad. I've never once had a problem at that location. I've been to the Val Vista location twice now and both times I've had to wait for soup. I always call ahead to make sure they have a kind of soup I want. I came today for albondigas and arrived at 1145 am. They we're already out so I promptly let them know and walked around a little while then grabbed my salad. At 1215 I asked how much longer and was told 23 minutes, they hadn't started warming it. Are you kidding me??? Ive already waited 30 minutes. How are you not prepared to refill your soups at lunch? Especially when you know the albondigas goes quick. I guess if you want the soup you better be here by 11 or you can forget it. How extremely disappointing in such an upscale overpriced place. Stick to the AJs in Chandler because this location is totally incompetent.
UPDATE 1245 and they finally brought out the soup. It was enough for one serving. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Best ice tea in town! I go to this place daily :)"}
{"text":"Just swung by and I bought 2 desserts. The cannoli was wonderful but I can't say the same for the cream puff. the pastry part was okay but the filling...it tasted like cool whip. But You get what u pay for. It was 1.99."}
{"text":"Makes me feel less like I live in a food desert. Often guilt-free baked goods, amazing selection of coffees and teas...and one of the best sushi places in town!"}
{"text":"A few months ago, I would have given this store 5 stars but lately it's been more of a 2 star at best other than the quality of the meat department. 

I went in last week for some tuna and grabbed some langostino lobster. It's precooked like shrimp, I figured I would mix it in with a salad. When I got it home it smelled rancid - very bad. Just opening the package filled the room with the smell. Not something the meat department guy could have missed. He shouldn't have sold it to me at $20.00 an lb. 

The other thing I've noticed is it the attitude from the meat department. if I'm at Frys, I don't really expect immediate help but when you're paying $30.00 a pound for steak, you figure the two workers in front of you complaining about their hours would stop for a couple minutes to give you a hand rather than look up and keep talking. 

Hopefully it will turn back around as I've always appreciated the service and quality of this location."}
{"text":"I think I just gained 10 pounds by looking at the Bakery case. I told my five year old to be careful and not get her hand prints all over the glass but I think I was being just as bad. I'm kicking myself now for walking away with nothing, but I couldn't make up my mind. Everything looked so good and they have a great selection of different items.

I love this store. Today was probably the busiest I have seen it (lunch time on a Wednesday) but it was easy to get around. The deli could have used some more staff. I was going to get the pizza special but decided against it because we were waiting for too long.

They carry some great items and are reasonably priced, but if you are expecting Fry's type deals, you won't find it here. Yes, it's part of a chain (a local one at that), but not a big box, fluorescent lighted, SUPERmarket.

The only area I don't like is checkout. One cashier...on a Wednesday at lunch rush. She called for two other people to come help but they didn't show. Instead the Store Director hopped on register to help...always happy to see a manager jump in where needed."}
{"text":"This review is primarily for the Wine Cellar and corporate offices. 

The Cellar-Master is awful, arrogant, and condescending. I've been a long time customer of this and other AJ's throughout the valley, and have spent HUNDREDS, maybe even thousands of dollars on premium liquor at their stores. 

I've been on the hunt for a particularly hard-to-find liquor, even ensuring that my name was added to the running \"list\" for distribution (I was told I was #3 at one store, #2 at another). Long story short, I didn't get the bottle I was waiting for...even though both stores received well over 3 bottles each. Each time I visit the store or call in to check on the shipment, I'm treated like a child, and given an eye-roll and sigh for even asking. This is ridiculous. I'm trying to spend over $300 on booze and I get this kind of customer service?? Terrible.

I was offered no explaination as to why I was passed over on the lists, instead I was given a \"tough luck\" and \"maybe next year\" from the CellarMaster. I wrote a long winded complaint letter to corporate a week ago and still have heard nothing back. I've even left voicemails with the Managers but haven't received any call back. I honestly expected a prompt response with at least an apology, but after a week of no response I can't help but bring my frustrations to the public via Yelp. 

Please avoid the wine cellar at this AJ's as best you can, and save yourself the frustration of having to deal with an grumpy, self-righteous \"cellar master\"."}
{"text":"Good: The sushi is bomb! Haven't had a time where it wasn't good. And the prices are great! I haven't eaten at any other sushi place since coming here. Never thought that a grocery store would have good sushi, let alone edible sushi. The people here are very friendly, and I always get greeted within seconds of standing anywhere in the store. They carry some exotic meats in their meat department, the bakery always looks delicious, and I've always enjoyed their selection of cigars.

Bad: I have had only one bad experience here. I was going to buy a cigar and was asked to show my ID by one of the management when he brought it out of the case -- not a big deal, I look like I'm 15 even though I'm 24. Up until now I've never had to show my ID to anyone but the cashier before. I showed him my ID, which only seemed to upset him for some unknown reason, and then he immediately turned to my girlfriend (who is wearing a hoodie with the hood on) and says, \"He needs to show me his ID as well\" with a condescending tone. I told him it was my girlfriend and not a \"he\", and he just sort of shrugged it off without apologizing. After he was done hassling us we were able to check out. The cashier was a bit shocked as to how he could confuse my girlfriend for a dude and we laughed about it. 

Other: I called to place a complaint about that manager later when I got home and was told that he was always sort of a jerk and not to sweat it lol. The jerk manager hasn't been there in at least a year, so no worries for those of you wishing to buy restricted items, who happen to look 15, and have a girlfriend wearing a hoodie."}
{"text":"What a pity, great store but incredibly lousy customer service. 
We had an issue and the manager was called and was unbelievably rude.
I sent a comment and someone by the name of Bill H. defended her attitude as following company policy, a portion of his response below.

\"My manager was not trying to be \"quite rude\" but only following company policy and doing her job\". 

We also asked for some help in the wine area and wow this person chased us to Total Wine. They do have some helpful employees but unfortunately when you are led by these types of people it filters down. So I'm done with this place and will tell everyone my experience."}
{"text":"Bakery is the best! Haven't yet try their grilling station on the outside of the store although the smell is amazing! Store is really clean and friendly staffs is a plus. Price is a little higher than regular grocery store but the quality is so worth your money. Hit up their sale with no rewards card needed for the meat section especially I'm hooked on their Kobe burgers. It's a big and juicy half pound burger that full of flavors. Must try!

Did I mention their sushi? Super fresh fish you can taste it. Happy hours price is very reasonable. 

I don't believe this place has a shopping cart. A handful of things you grab can cost you about $50 easy."}
{"text":"Great sushi bar w/happy hour! The deli is fantastic (delish green chicken tamales + pizza) as is the bakery,too.  Huge spirits selection."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good grocery store, this isn't it. If you're looking for random import foods, like the real Hinze Baked Beans or a really good wine this is the place. After buying your wine and your tin of beans, head over to the bakery. This is a hands down must, because they have some of the tastiest treats on the earth. Just make sure you eat something before you go, otherwise you'll end up with about 129438495 calories in your cart."}
{"text":"love there home fragrances and candles there.nice variety and selection of groceries."}
{"text":"The service in the bakery is really good. Their pastries are delicious. I recommend preordering a cake there. I always get their berries n creme cake. The prices are decent and the display of their French Pastries looks spectacular. I also love their lemonades. They taste so good and it's a great deal. Less than 2 bucks gives me their large cup."}
{"text":"Their bakery is one of the best I have ever been too, especially for a market. The atmosphere at the store is wonderful and they have some of the best products and quality. The prices can be a bit higher but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"For those who are used to shopping at wal-mart for everything this is not your kind of place. This store serves two different kinds of people. Those with lots of money and those looking for hard to find items. I was feeling like trying something a little different so I went to this location hoping to find a few rare gems. 
Big huge thick brownies that look like they where stolen from a food network set ( did they kidnap Paula Dean?) along with a chocolate skyscraper they call a cake. They are one of the few places one can find heirloom tomatoes, and real andouille sausage. 

Plus if you get food stamps they take those to (don't act like you never used them before)! I recommend at least checking this place out if you are tired of the same old bargain bag, run of the meal selection of produce and meats. And while they do charge you an arm and a leg for things you can at least feel superior to most while you very slowly eat your $2.00 apple.    LOL"}
{"text":"AJ's has the best desserts anywhere! My husband loves pecan pie - I can usually take it or leave it, but AJs was Amazing. We also bought other desserts there before and they were great too. The best place for a special dessert. They also have a great selection of wine and other gourmet foods."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice places are great for lunch when I am out conducting my life on a schedule.  AJs is usually top notch.  I was a little late for standard lunch.  It was 2:30 in the afternoon and this could be the reason this is a 3 star rating.   

It seemed I was getting a great deal for this monstrous slice.  Sausage, Bell Peppers, Red Onion etc......and the pizza wasn't cut symmetrically, so I told the guy exactly which piece I wanted (HUGE).  My mouth started to water as he box it up for me.....Mmmm  

I was the 1st to a slice out of this pizza.  Everything was good except the crust.  The crust was not cooked all the way or it was a little soggy from setting a bit too long.  I am not sure which one.  The other ingredients and flavors were all great!  However, the crust is the foundation of pizza.   

I expect more from AJs, than a normal store, because I am usually paying more.  AJs crust had expired for me.  This was NOT a gourmet experience.  I reached so high for lunch and landed in a soft doughy mediocrity, that I can only offer 3 measly stars.  At least it is 3 stars though.  I am accepting partial responsibility for this one due to my timing.    

Still love the price and pizza, but perhaps I shouldn't eat lunch so late.  There are benefits to the wait during lunch rush, because everything is fresh...."}
{"text":"In my quest to find bottled soda to filled the void left by the closing of Pop the Soda Shoppe in Scottsdale, I decided to check out A.J.'s.  I've always been impressed by their meat selection.  You can't fault a place that sells crawfish, oysters, trout, and pretty much any other cut of meat you can think of.  

When I found the bottled sodas, I was in heaven.  They have a chilled section with single bottles, and a shelf with packs.  They don't have a gigantic selection, but considering it's not a soda shop, you can't fault them for just having one shelf devoted to bottled sodas.  They had Sonoran Root Beer, Moxie, Boylan's Creamy Red Birch, Dublin Dr. Pepper, Sioux City, Oogave, Thomas Kemper, Jones...the list goes on.  Needless to say, I spent $30 there that day.

This is no Wegman's by any means... But I don't think we can expect a Wegman's replacement short of an actual Wegman's opening in town."}
{"text":"Way over priced for what the quality they offer. Whole Foods is so much better for so many reasons. To make it worse, with the exception of the cashiers, the employees are not friendly. Dismal customer service. The store was pretty empty during the middle of the day on a Saturday. It is easy to see why"}
{"text":"Bashas owned AJ's Fine Foods caught cheating customers by mislabeling meats. I always supported Bashas since they were a locally owned company and I respected Mr Eddie Basha. I also frequented AJ's. No more for me. I will drive the extra distance to Whole Foods. Eddie Basha must be turning over in his grave, RIP. Here is the link to the article:

{"text":"While I have never shopped her for grocery's, I come in all the time for desert or lunch. All of their deserts are amazing. If you are looking for an interesting way to end a date, stop here and grab something from their European style bakery counter. They also have a really great salad bar for lunch where you can load up a salad to your liking (sold by the lb). The store is always clean and has a charming atmosphere."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about AJ's is the bakery. I can always find great treats for parties and gifts. The food is always fresh, the staff is always helpful. This location is never too busy."}
{"text":"It's as if Williams-Sonoma and Wegmans gave birth and named their baby AJ's.  We're from the east coast, and I miss my Wegmans dearly.... We've tried Albertsons, Frys, and Safeway, and none came close to Wegmans until I discovered AJ's.

It's a smaller grocery store, and they seem to focus on specialty, gourmet, and prepared foods more than anything else.  So I'm not going to go here for toilet paper in bulk or anything, but if I need to get last minute sides for dinner or something, or beer, the beer selection looked insane.... Never have I ever seen pineapple beer until I ventured into this glorious store.  Not sure if I'd actually want to drink pineapple beer for that matter, but if I change my mind I know where I can buy it!

And I don't think it's that much more expensive than other grocery stores.  The Shamrock milk cost the same as it did in the regular grocery, they just didn't have generic brands like the cheaper generic milk, and bulk and all that business.  Anyways, bought great humongous desserts from the bakery case, that were worth every bit of the $2.99 that they cost.  Awesome sushi, broccoli salad, and random groceries."}
{"text":"This place wishes it was Whole Foods or something. I get that you're trying to be an upscale market and all, with your marked up prices and such. Just don't try to pull that crap off with things you can find half price (ok, maybe an exaggeration) for the same exact product elsewhere. 

The store is large is there is a good selection, but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Meh. My husband and I started coming on the weekend for a pastry and a coffee... but the coffee is burnt/sucks about 50% of the time. Also, last time they had a girl working there with injuries on her hands and fingers and because of this she was too slow to pull the shots in time/foam the milk (this was done too long) and the result was burnt coffee. It was not her fault- in my opinion it was unfair of them to have her working coffee if this was the case, perhaps they should assign her to another area until her hand heals. Incompetent management I suppose. Overall, the workers at the bakery are not particularly friendly, not really a proper greeting or thank you or anything- and I would like to note it seems there are different people every time we go. Most of the desserts are pretty good but sometimes they don't seem that fresh... Also, the couple times we have ordered breakfast the chefs havent been friendly or particularly helpful either. They don't greet you or explain anything really. That is my major problem with this store. I never have a good feeling when I leave this place- I am always annoyed and angry. And that does not make me want to come back. To be honest, I really don't know how this place has any customers at times... I guess some people feel good over paying for items whilst being treated like plebs..."}
{"text":"I don't usually shop at AJ's unless I am looking for something very specific that I cannot find anywhere else. The item in the past has been canoli shells. I like to make home made canolis occassionally but I am never daring enough to make the shells. I can never find them anywhere other than AJ's. I would say that if you are looking for something special that the average grocery store doesnt have, try AJ's. They are a bit expensive though so I would go here as a last resort. Now normally, I would give this place only 3 stars, however, yesterday, I discovered their dessert counter. OMG, I was in heaven! I knew they had cakes and fruit tarts (which btw are outstanding although 30.00 apiece), however, they also have a vast array of mini gourmet desserts for when you have a major sweet craving and want something special to satisfy it. Im talking mini carrot cakes, mini fruit tarts (yes!!! I dont have to pay 30.00 whenever I want a tart from them), mini tiramisu's rounds, brownies, canoli's (WTF?) and even mini creme brulees! Additionally, they have home made chocolates which looked equally delicious. I opted for the tiramisu which was not only tantalizing but light, creamy, and honestly, one of the best Tiramisu's Ive had in awhile probably since the wine train in Napa. My best friend said that her praline chocolates were very good as well. I got a brownie for the hubby which is enormous and I will post an update once he tries it. What's even better is that the mini desserts are really reasonably priced so if you are looking for a dessert for someone to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, whatever, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"We live in Val Vista Lakes so sometimes we like to walk over here and browse. They have a great bakery, an outdoor grill to get fresh burgers and hotdogs and a cute little sushi bar inside. You can find some fun gourmet snacks here."}
{"text":"When visiting Mesa we used to regularly go to AJ's on Sunday morning for the outside brunch.  It the past the omelettes and customer service were outstanding but in the last couple of months or so the quality of the service and the food product has gone in the porcelain crapper.  They had some big guy \"cooking\" that had no customer service skills and even fewer skills as a \"cook\".  He was a real smart a** and didn't make the omelettes to our order on any occasion.  I know the job market is tight but AJ's can only be losing Sunday brunch business with a customer facing employee of this low caliber."}
{"text":"I am revising my rating to top notch!  Recently a very dear person to me relocated and I wanted a simple but very special card to give to them.  I went to four stores and nothing touched me.  Then with 15 minuted to spare I went to AJ'S.  I found the PERFECT card within 5 minutes.  It was the most expensive card I had ever bought, but  sssooo  worth it when I saw the look on the face of my friend!  Thank you AJ'S for the most perfect memory.

I am fairly new to the Gilbert area, having moved out here from Boston a little over a year ago.  found my way around and found AJ's.  I have always been a consumer of finer foods, especially during the Holidays, and this store more than exceeds my expectations.  Especially since they stock my favorite German wine.  Whenever I am preparing for a special dinner,  or occasion it AJ's for me.  I love the quality.  Their cakes cannot be beat.  I am the favorite of the office birthday celebrations."}
{"text":"I hate to give AJs such a low rating, but get real people. Prices are twice as high as Trader Joes and Sprouts. Unfortunately, the food is not twice as good. I was hoping to pick up something for dinner from the deli today, but the food did not look good and for the price I could get a nice take-out meal at a dozen local restaurants (which is what I ended up doing). 

Yes, they do carry some products that you don't find in some other stores, but that does not excuse the price gouging issue. Calling a store and its merchandise \"upscale\" doesn't make it so or justify these prices."}
{"text":"I love coming here to buy affordable yet delicious cakes! The food from all different cultures here are very cool to check out and the desserts always look amazing!!!"}
{"text":"If I had a higher salary, I would shop here. I love this store, however the only reason I come here is if I am looking for something you can't get at a large grocery chain like a Fry's Marketplace.

They have a great wine selection, fine imported cheeses and the pastry counter makes your mouth water. When they are having a sale on steak I always buy it here."}
{"text":"This is a high-end market.  You can get sushi-grade tuna, fine cuts of meat, various gourmet prepared foods, etc.  Plus their cafe is better than what you usually find in a grocery.  And they have a sushi bar.  And a really good soup bar.

You can find most items you would find in a normal grocery, but higher-end.  Better quality.

Pricey, but very good stuff."}
{"text":"This place kills me, as in, I am sooo upset they don't have one where I live in CA. In fact CA is disapointing in general, completley run down, not redeveloped and old and crappy!

Sorry just ranting. Anyhoo. Visiting here with my family for xmas vacation. My relatives live in the area and we stumbled upon this actually in the Desert Village shopping center at Pinnacle Peak.  So closer to my aunts house, we tracked this location on a different day and had lunch.

Again, where has this place been all of my life?? I just want to move to AZ just so I can shop here. This place is amazing! Their selection of food is outstanding and their food is great too.

They have a sushi bar, a wood fire oven for pizza's and pretty decent sandwiches. I didn't get to look around too much but from what I saw, it was sooo awesome.

We sat outside and ate our lunch in the patio/restaurant type place which was closed. We then walked around Dana Park, which I'm pretty sure where this is located, and had a nice time looking around.

Enclosing, I am writing a letter to California explaining my distaste in their lack of everything:

Dear California,

You suck. You can't possibly think you are considered \"the best state on the west coast\" which is such a misconception to the rest of the world. Since I have lived here, I have never experienced such a badly maintained living area in my life. You don't build, you don't grow, everything is so old and run down. It's so sad. I guess I'm stupid. Having experienced the \"real life\" where there is growth, and new business and new roads and new this and that, I am so ashamed that I live here. I have been all over California and still and completley suprised that it's so badly runned down. Even the nice areas, you consider nice, areas of L.A., San Francisco, Monterey, Carmel whatever. Nothing compares to the newness and expansion of other states such as AZ.

Sincerely,

Someone who grew up better than that

AJ's: don't expand to California they don't deserve it. I'm moving out."}
{"text":"I always have a good experience when I go to AJ's.  When it was time to get platters for a wedding open house, I just didn't consider anyplace else!  I called the catering director, and even though it was a busy season, he let me know when he would be available to help me order.  The plates were not only beautiful but the fruits and cheeses were the finest quality.  Guests were so pleased!  They cost a bit more than grocery or warehouse store fare, but they are so worth it!"}
{"text":"Always clean,  helpful staff who lend great opinions and options on a variety of products. Brands are limited to a few select ones and although they seem to be the higher quality or caliber than most they arent always the preferred favorites of some.  

Pricing is sometimes steep also but again this isnt food city its in a class all to its own.  

I highly recommend trying the cappuccino muffin it is nothing short of amazing."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. I am not coming back. Rude, uppity cashiers, no greeting, no room at endcaps to put cart so you can move groceries to ledgecuz too much crap and tables set up for impulse buys which caused me to drop a bottle which broke. NOT ONE PERSON ASKED IF I WAS OK or needed help, just scoffed and rolled eyes as I pucked glass out of my foot. No attempt to clean it for at least ten minutes. Just rudeness. From now on I'm buying my overpriced groceries and cheese at Whole Foods. Screw you guys. Then when I left you asked my white friend if she was ok. Have fun being a cashier. #6figuresandsinglenokids #disposableincome #shoppingwhilebrown"}
{"text":"There are so many good things to say about AJ's, it's hard to know where to start. Amazing meats and seafood. Great deli items. Great sushi bar. Knowledgeable staff. Fantastic produce. Gorgeous flowers. And the pastries... the list just goes on and on. 

There is usually a somalier on staff to help with wine selections to go with whatever cut of meat or seafood choice you've gone with. A good mix of everyday grocery items as well as specialty items. If you can find the marinated garlic, try it! It's so so good. Try the butternut lasagna if the deli has it. And the pastries... The pastries. Cheesecakes, mini red velvet cakes, Boston Cream Pies, cupcakes, croissants, bagels... All of the highest quality. You will never have a problem finding something sweet to curb that craving, except that you may have a problem narrowing the field. 

Note: not every AJ's has a sushi bar, so keep that in mind if you head to a different location with a hankering for fresh sushi. 

No matter what you're going in for, the friendly, helpful staff will help ensure you get exactly what you need."}
{"text":"Superior deli, akin to Eatzi's  in Dallas. Lots of fancy pre made foods, scads of high end dressings, spices and other food adornments. They even have a lavish little boutique area featuring fancy aprons, cook wear and compelling Doo dads.

Loves, Salami, cheeses, nuts and crackers its pricy, but it is Snotsdale!"}
{"text":"I had the best carnitas breakfast burrito that I've ever had in my life at this location.   I've been back to get it several times but they've never had them again.  Do yourself a favor, if you're here in the morning and you see that they have carnitas breakfast burritos, get one! (and then PM me and tell me they're there)"}
{"text":"#AJs Fine Foods is an excellent source for your vegan whole foods. I was shocked that it wasn't near as expensive as everyone said. On par with whole foods."}
{"text":"Came here and grabbed some dinner with my man. I had a cup of chili and he had a cup of cream of chicken. I loved my chili, great flavor and texture. Nice and chunky, full of meat beans and just enough spice to get your nose running. The cream of chicken did not fare as well, it was bland at best. To give you a good idea of how our 'fine dining' went down, the cream of chicken now sits cold and half eaten, while the chili cup is wiped clean.

The convenience was easily the primary reason we decided to go to AJs. We grabbed our grub and headed home. There was a lot to choose from, we'll most likely come back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"It's good, lots of specialty stuff. A little too hogtie toytie for me. I prefer Eddy's lesser store Food City, hahaha"}
{"text":"Welcome to the elite grocery shopping experience. But I'm not going to talk to you about that.

I'm talking 'bout breakfast. The tasty breakfast that is served on the store patio. To be honest, I'm not certain what other days the breakfast is served, but Sunday is my AJ's breakfast day at least once a month.

Darcie and I make a morning of it. Walk to AJ's, place our tastiness order, head inside to get some blackberry tea from the Deli or a 1/2 gallon of OJ, pay the amazing checker (they're all amazing), and grab a table on the patio.

\"Tastiness\" you ask? Well, indeed. 
Omelets made to order
Belgian Waffles with Fruit and Whipped Cream
Quiche
Homestyle potatoes
Mixed fruit
Biscuits and gravy
Bacon, Sausage, Bacon, Bacon, Bacon

Make yourself happy. See you Sunday."}
{"text":"Aj's is great. There are some wonderful treats, meats and more. The produce is good, but a bit overpriced. I recommend the farmer's market for your best produce. The only thing I will say about that, is that Aj's sometimes has harder to find items (think broccolini or purple carrots).

The store is always clean, but usually is freezing cold inside. The service counters are really my biggest gripe, because they don't use a number system. I was waiting at the bakery counter, and when they yelled \"next!\", some lady acted like she was next, and I really had no recourse as snowbird after snowbird told the counter that they were next. I don't really want to go elbows out and tell off an old lady! The sushi counter, meat and seafood, and hot deli counters are pretty much the same. But with all of the areas, their wares are always amazing.

The normal grocery items are priced higher than average. They also don't have much stuff for the serfs of the world. It's all fancy schmancy. 

The staff at checkout is always so nice. I enjoy a quick and personable cashier, and have never been disappointed in this area.

If you're looking for good quality products and something really great for dinner, look no further than AJ's Fine Foods. Just don't hurt anybody getting to the counter! I'm next!"}
{"text":"I think this is an excellent place to shop, top quality meats, wines but my girfriend went there to get some mussels and she said they were bad, the guy was picking out the bad ones, this surprised me because I thought this was the to go place for seafood but will have to go elsewhere for seafood, everything else is great!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I go almost daily. They are the friendliest group of people! The best food, the best service! I get all my papyrus cards there for any occasion, as well as treats for my kids, husband and myself. The \"Magic Bars\" are to die for!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to AJ's for a couple specific items! Their sushi bar, dessert counter, build a salad bar, produce, and they have a nice assortment of local and unique items in the center isles.

I'm not sure if people are aware of how delicious their fruit pies are! We LOVE the apple and strawberry Rhubarb pies! The fruit isn't mushy and the price point is great for the size and quality of the pies!  

Upscale grocery store"}
{"text":"REVIEW OF OUTSIDE GRILL:  If you haven't had a burger from their grill you're missing out!  the meat is fresh and delicious, they are cooked to order and comes with just about anything you want on them.  So you can get this huge burger plus 2 sides for $7.95....best price in the whole store.  They also have chicken, brats, dogs and steak, but so far we can't get past the delicious burgers.  We eat lunch here at least once a week and typically split the meal.....plenty for lunch!"}
{"text":"Love the bakery but the customer service sucks! Maybe people need to find another job they are better at...."}
{"text":"In the past few months, I have seen some new smiling, friendly faces manning the registers and restocking the produce. It is a welcomed change, as my last rating was so low because of the poor attitudes of the staff. The personnel that is still the same has become seemingly happier and more welcoming. Hopefully they have been reading customer feedback and realized life is too short to be miserable. Whatever works! Im happy to adjust my rating because they adjusted their outlooks on life(and the avocados are still the best in town)."}
{"text":"Just came in tonight to grab a nice dinner. The service was horrible! I asked if they had any Gluten free options for their dinners and they didn't know and seemed inconvenienced and actually huffed at us. Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Super helpful employees, finest quality, selection and always clean. Limited high end select brands. The display layouts are close to works of art. The meat and seafood section is worth a visit to see how the 1%'s eat. You can find items here that are hard to find on the internet. For example: Halloumi Cheese. The World's Best Grilling cheese and the checkout lady says \"This is very popular, we sell a lot of it.\" Try finding it on the internet and you will see how pleased I was to see not one, but 12 packages of it in the cheese section. I also went by the deli for some premium pastrami and the bread rack for a great smelling Brooklyn rye. My wife select an aged Feta. Guess what we are having tonight with our grilled Halloumi cheese. Wish you were here, it's going to be an evening to remember.   ."}
{"text":"Sad to say but don't bother ordering any type of catering item from AJ's for Christmas.  Even though their commercials say call and order. When you do actually call to order you are told they are not taking any more orders."}
{"text":"Great food and service here, best wine, beer and liquor selection, lots of great to- go food options, and plenty of awesome fresh produce and the meat and seafood counter is to die for.  Oh and they have some nice gifts too, for the out of towners."}
{"text":"I am a regular here.  The BBQ out on the front patio is great.  Come see Rick or Mike and I recommend the Kobe Burger it is 8 dollars with one side . It is fantastic and the service is great. You come try it and tell me it's not worth every penny you spent. 

Way to go Rick....."}
{"text":"We called ahead to see how late they were open. We were told the Bistro was open til 9pm. We had seen the $9.99 Cuban Sandwich of the Month. The photo looked so good we decided to give it a try. We arrived around 7pm and ordered our sandwich. The soda machine was shut down so we had to forgo a soda. We purchased the scrapings of broc cheese soup and some salad. $14.00 then we purchased an imported beer $1.99. 

Can we sue for bait and switch advertisements, we should be able to .. The photo shows layers of Ham , Pork and Salami. What we got was a sandwich with a paper thin piece of ham, another paper thin piece of pork, I mean so thin you can see through and 2 paper thin slices of salami a few pickle chips sprinkled on .  There was more bread than sandwich. 

We enjoyed the soup, the beer was excellent. We will not be returning for another sandwich Subway can do better. 

Disappointed"}
{"text":"We visited AJ's for the second time in 4 years this week. We only shop there when we need something special that the regular supermarkets don't carry. I was looking for Fusili and I found it right away. The store is clean and organized. They carry a wide variety of specialty foods, so we enjoy looking around. We were also quite impressed by the sushi bar and the selection of pre-packaged sushi. The bakery area was dangerous...Too many treats it is hard to make a decision! We would recommend AJ's to our friends."}
{"text":"Amazing dessert selection and freshly made sushi! I love the selection of items you can't find anywhere else. However, things like milk and cereal or any other everyday items are way overpriced. I'll still to larger chains for those, but AJ's is my go to for bringing something unique or special to the table. Love it!"}
{"text":"While my lunches, snacks and beverages are always delicious...I LOATHE dealing with their bakery staff. They are always rude and impatient. I work in the same complex and come in often, I smile and greet them comfortably because I see them about 3x a week...they never smile back and always look like I'm bothering them. I literally just had someone slam my straw on the counter, it's just an iced tea, sorry I asked! Last time I checked, you work at the bakery counter and have to deal with people on a daily basis. If you don't want to deal with customers don't work at a grocery store. Smile, just smile?! Sheesh!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty pricey, but you get what you pay for!  Everything seems to be top quality.  I really like their outside grill and their bakery is tough to beat.  VERY good food!  I just wouldn't really do my grocery shopping here."}
{"text":"Well, I must say, I love AJ's...sometimes apparently. 

Gosh, where to start...I went in and wanted a bagel with flavored cream cheeses, they didn't offer what I was looking for. I still bought a bagel  there, I just knew my better 2/3'rds was not going to be happy with the final product...so I paid, left and went to Panera. I also made myself a salad, the chicken was so old it was inedible...I went again today (Sunday and Monday in a row) The chicken was worse today. I am very serious when I say it tasted dead, DEAD. Absolutely putrid and 100% inedible. My first bite and I wanted to vomit, so scared since I didn't vomit from that one caveman ancient aged old lady bite of nasty crap that my body may have issues for days...FML. 

All I can say is there was not ONE employee at any check out lane, the salad bar needs serious attention and freshness as the greens were extremely wilted and the bakery food is so ancient I couldn't believe what I witnessed...absolutely putrid and disgraceful."}
{"text":"This place is a gem, because you can find things here that you just *CAN'T* find elsewhere. Now, that being said... there's a LOT of stuff here that you CAN find elsewhere, and I'd encourage you to do so. This isn't your one-stop-shop. Go to Fry's first, and get everything you need. But if you're preparing a special recipe and want to find something with an extra 'oomph', then you owe it to yourself to stop by here. Their USDA Prime meats are *AMAZING*. I'm not kidding. If you're a regular meat eater then you OWE it to yourself to treat yourself to the Prime meats at some point (for Choice and lower, you can get good cuts at other places). 

Sometimes, for recipes, you need fancy things, and this is the place to come for those things. COquilles Saint-Jacques recipe calling for fish stock? No problem- pop on down here, buy a box, and pour the leftover into an ice cube tray for your next recipe. Walk down the aisles and dream. In the words of Tom and Donna from Parks and Rec:

\"TREAT YOSELF!\""}
{"text":"I'm a value sorta guy...considering that, I should HATE this place on paper, but the quality, selection of items you won't find other places, and general vibe of the store are fantastic.  You will pay top dollar, but you get top notch stuff in return! Their baked goods are exquisite, their meats are the most gorgeous chunks of dead flesh you'll ever see, and then.. there's the Beer & Wine. Wow."}
{"text":"I know I can always find fresh, unique food here. I love how clean the store always is and the great selection of specialty items including seafood selection, meats, and vegetables. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the dessert case just isn't what it used to be. While they still have a good selection, the quality seems to have slipped and the prices have skyrocketed. Love everything else about the store though."}
{"text":"OK, this isn't the first time I've been in an AJ's but it's the first time I've been in THIS one. AJ's has the categories of foodstuffs that you'd find in a Safeway or Sprouts, but think of it as not as much to choose from in each category. The produce is very nicely laid out, and even includes locally-grown items. Meat and seafood is in the back in a fairly elaborate case--seafood, beef, chicken, pork, and various combinations like bacon-wrapped scallops and pecan-encrusted tilapia. 

There is a nice wine \"cellar\" and a deli area. There's even a small outdoor seating area for eating.

AJ's is nice on one hand because you can find one-of-a-kind items. One the other hand, my experience in here was almost enough to induce a panic attack if you don't like small spaces crowded with people. There also isn't very logical organization of items. 

So while it's nice for some things, I don't think I'll be shopping here every week."}
{"text":"I love AJ's! Great place to grab some lunch, tea, or maybe some flowers for your mom/girlfriend. I came here tonight because I had a terrible sweet tooth. Got some Baklava, 2 cookies (.75 cents each), and a caramel coffee cheese brownie. The cookies and baklava were great. The brownie was too sweet for me. If you're a huge sweet tooth then it's for you."}
{"text":"I've been coming here 3 times a week, for either coffee, fresh pastry, great selections of soups, and deli.   I love how you can order hot foods by the pound,and I get to sample fresh apple juice, or their fine cheeses    I also get tempted to taste their wines, while I'm on my break.  :) 
Their customer service is always helpful....I never give a place 5 stars, cause there's always room for some kind of improvement."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today - 

Everything is a bit pricey but the ambiance and quality are they key points here

Had the Turkey Sandwich lunch combo for $9
Lotta Turkey - Good not Great

I do have to say exploring Aj's is a lot more fun then going inside Safeway"}
{"text":"Do not miss their samples, their ham salad, their oregonzola, their 50 cent white macadamia or M&M cookies, huge floral section, their unsweetened flavored iced tea, or their flavored coconut water.  AJ's is a treat!  You are encouraged to sit out on the patio and chat or read."}
{"text":"Worst AJs in the valley.  Salad bar is always empty or the the items are frozen.   The hot food is always over cooked and dried out.   Not to mention they never have more than one cashier.   I drive 10 miles to the by Kyrene and Ray.  That is a what an AJs should be.  This isn't a one time thing, this store in Dana Park is horrible."}
{"text":"I love AJ's
I don't just LIKE AJ's... I LOVE AJ's...

I come here as often as possible to eat everything that they sell (even the dog food... okay not the dog food).

I don't live here which is frustrating because AJ's is really one of the only places I really love in Phoenix... this one in particular I think has the best selection and the most lovely store of the three or four I've been to.

Nothing here is ever bad
Everyone who works here clearly enjoys their chosen work
The selection of foods is incredible


It is really top notch and fantastic. I am really glad my company gives me a food per diem to spend, because I spend almost every cent of it here when I am in the vicinity!

Perfecto!"}
{"text":"I was hanging out at B&N and had a craving for sushi. Just so happens I was right next to this place. A wonderfully discovered jem. The sushi was just what I needed. I'll have to come back to go grocery shopping!"}
{"text":"Liked it sold more upscale stuff but good quality.  Something like Whole foods but a bit more expensive in some items.  And I agree with others the bakery is really nice."}
{"text":"I love AJs - I know that if I need some \"specialty\" type of item - they will have it.  I know that if I want to grab a yummy, delicious baked good - they will have it.  I know if I want to pick up some fabulous cut of meat - they will have it.  Do I shop there everyday?  Of course not - but I do make it there about once a month.

They also have a great kids program that meets once a month.  For Easter they had an egg hunt, complete with bunny, baskets with goodies in them ready for the kids and a gourmet treat for them when they were done with the hunt.  My kids came home with jelly belly beans, belgium chocolate bunnies, german chocolate & fruit creme filled eggs and hand made bunny & chick fruit gummies - all for the low, low cost of $0!  And the brunch on the patio is pretty tasty too! 

They are also AZ locally owned - that right there give them one step up in my book."}
{"text":"The outdoor bistro has some great cook to order food potato salad macaroni salad awesome. Best burger I've had in a long long time. Super friendly service nice clean area I will be back.The cook is very friendly. Great service. Thanks!"}
{"text":"this is mr h's birthday week and i went to aj's specifically to pick up two \"bundtlets\" from nothing bundt cakes. the budtlets are a single serving size.  i got him the pecan praline and for me white white chocolate. they are so yummy! 

aj's located in the intersection of val vista/baseline. in a nice shopping area called dana park village square.  in this same shopping center they have a variety of retail shopping options and some great casual restaurants like pei wei, CPK, five guys burgers, RA. 

back to aj's! the customer service is good and most of the employees are helpful, courteous.

the store as other yelpers stated is on the expensive side.  in addition to the treats, aj's also has fresh produce, meat, beautiful flowers, and gourmet items. they have a salad bar but that can become picked over during the lunch rush. lately they haven't been good about refilling it either.

overall: i will likely revisit aj's for my next special occasion sweet fix."}
{"text":"Still done with their Italian Kitchen - pizza is very inconsistent.

But, I've moved outside to their grill. Mmm, mmm, mmm! Grilled to order - and to perfection - burgers. Pulled pork and more. The grill master has been there some 13 years. He's friendly. He's fast. If his grill isn't already full, figure it'll take about 10-15 minutes for your burger.

Lettuce, onion and tomato presented in a zip lock bag. Pickles, peppers and more sitting there for the taking. Side orders from potato salad to corn and more available.

Exceptionally reasonable pricing - $5.50 for a cheeseburger. Sides add $2. Compare this to pricing at any of the other lunch options in Dana Park and it's a steal of a deal."}
{"text":"What happened to AJ's? There was nobody in the place shopping Saturday morning they've changed recipes they didn't have any of the things we buy and they didn't have anything that I tasted that I wanted to eat I usually get the sample go I want that what happened to this place is it only for snowbirds with money that come from out of town and the people that live here???? I can't believe it this is my go-to place when I couldn't think of what to eat I couldn't believe I was in there wondering what I was going to eat spent $30 which is about a third of what we normally spend and I still don't have anything to eat my kid did she likes carbs"}
{"text":"This is a very chic grocery store. Lots of veggies including rare mushrooms. Nice meat section with lots of selections. Wine collection, a sushi bar, sweet thing bar, and a great flower section."}
{"text":"It's a higher end grocery store that has the best sushi bar inside. I've always been treated well here and today I shared that welcomed feeling with my sons."}
{"text":"Wow - very impressed on our first visit to AJ's Fine Foods!

When entering the store you are amazed by the smell of food. To our left was a wonderful bakery with some wonderful assortments of cakes, pies, and desserts. As we continued to roam, we went by the deli, soup bar, salad bar, and many other fine foods. 

The store was clean and very friendly! Prices were higher than average stores, but you pay for what you get as they say!

We can not wait to come back and have lunch outside on the patio - serving BBQ!

Will definitely be coming back and knowing I will be taken care of."}
{"text":"This is a store that focuses on specialty items of superb quality. The selection of fresh produce, wines, and specialty items is good. There is a pretty complete bakery filled with yummy pastries, pies, and cookies. They have a meat counter with organic meats. The prices is are quite a bit higher than you'd pay at a grocery store, but the quality is much better."}
{"text":"This review is only for the bakery. Mmm the sugar cookie samples were good and I will be trying the fruit tart tonight!  The large fruit tart ($30) comes very highly recommended."}
{"text":"AJ's is unique amongst Food stores and not for the price sensitive customer. I enjoy buying beverages and floral products at AJ's and appreciate their wide selection of wines, organic juices and energy drinks. Their floral department is well stocked and will allow you to select a pre built bouquet along with several additional flower stems to have them rearrange into something unique and then priced as a new bouquet.  My favorite way to bring flowers home..."}
{"text":"I like AJ's because they always have my White Chocolate Ale. Other than that, I just slum it and go to a regular grocery store for everything else."}
{"text":"This review is for the cafe area . I have not been or shopped around in the entire store .
Came here with a girlfriend the other night and wanted a nice evening snack . 
First off , if you've never tried one of there goodies that are on display you MUST!
  So my recommendation is ordering there chai latte and the medium fruit tart ! At least that's what I did , NO regrets ! It hit the spot! The fruit tart was freshly made with an assortment of fresh fruits on the top of soft delicious creme which sat on top of a coveted coveted pie crust . To die for ! And my chai latte was much  above the average Starbucks chai . 
 Customer service was nice and efficient . Overall , a splendid experience ! I totally recommend getting an afternoon snack and sitting on one of their patio chairs . Thanks Ajs !"}
{"text":"Nice shopping area on Val Vista, west side of road, just south of the highway.  Normal selection in terms of food, but the beer, wine, and spirits were noticeably smaller in offerings compared to many of the central Phoenix AJ's locations.

Parking was good."}
{"text":"Does anyone know what time this overpriced Basha's opens?  No hours posted on their website.  That causes a loss of business stupid."}
{"text":"Extremely over priced!  Many hard to find items can be purchased at regular grocery stores these days. I kept getting sick from eating their soups only to find out that the bad produce that wasn't sold was given to the chef's along with the old meat to make the fresh soups everyday."}
{"text":"My sister-in-law had called and had on hold two bottles of butter scotch flavoring.  It was at customer service.  Upon entering the AJ, I did not find a customer service desk.  No sign that I could see.

So I went to cashier but she had 6 people in line, so I tried the dessert counters.  Lady behind counter said it up front.  so I went back up from and the same cashier still had a line, then I see a lady go and set down at the desk up from.  

When I ask if she was customer service, she says no, its that lady pointing to a group of people at the cashier area.  That was little help.

So after a deep breath, I explained that I was there to pick up something on hold.   I saw two bottles setting on the window sill.  It had my sister-in-law name on it so I was able to take and did not have to wait for that lady to come back.

Now I had to go to the cashier that had now has two people in line.

Should not be that hard?"}
{"text":"I love this place. One the best parts is the lunchtime bareque that they have every weekday. I've had everything from the burger to the steak and all of it was awesome."}
