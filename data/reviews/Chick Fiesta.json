{"text":"This is our go-to place! We always get the ribs, they're very very good! Tried the chicken platter dish - was alright. and the chicken wings are good too. Price is reasonable, portion sizes are good. Service is friendly.  Only reason didn't give it 5 stars because service is a bit on the slow side...but the great food makes up for that.  I defintely reccomend this place!"}
{"text":"My bf and I just had lunch here. He had been once before but it was my first time. The gentleman at the front remembered my bf and what he had ordered the last time which was helpful. We both ordered the half chicken. His with mild sauce and mine with hot. The chicken was perfectly grilled. The rice was deliciously seasoned with African spices. The salad was so fresh. All for a very reasonable price of 30$. We will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"if you want to have a nice lunch, dinner then you must visit Chick Fiesta, this place is nice and clean, food is always fresh and tasty. try the flame grill chicken, kebabs, T-bone or beef short ribs. i gave 5 stars because of freshness, taste, quality and portions are big. customer service is very friendly and greet and please all the time, highly recommended, for those who prefer Halal, this place is 100% halal, HMA certified."}
{"text":"I have never dined in. I always order from them on just-eat. Never takes too long to arrive. Food is always tasting great! Literally always the same order.. chicken sandwiches, fries, and grilled chicken."}
{"text":"We need a restaurant like this here in this area, very pleasant hostess who is also the lady in charge of delivering the meals which they do as well. Great food, hot too if you like it that way. Just hope they have a portable credit / debit machine for their deliveries soon. Very reasonably priced meals."}
{"text":"I had to immediately review this place. My husband and I just finished eating here for the first time and the food was delicious. We had asked for recommendations on what people get which is typically the peri chicken. We decided to get the walk in special which were told is about 8 pieces of chicken with potatoes and I also added a side caesar salad. My bill came to $27 with taxes and I am more than satisfied. Not only does the food taste like you're eating at home but you don't few guilty afterwards. It cannot get any better than this.   Bonus Tip: It's Halal :) They also do delivery on orders over 25 within 5km You can do pickup or dine in They have different options for level of \"spicyness\". We got mild and being someone who doesn't like spicy food it was perfect."}
{"text":"This place is just a little cheaper than Nandos only reason I come with just a little less quality than Nandos but horrible service every time they tell me 20 to 30 min wait which is okay when I call ahead but when you come to pick it up they tell you an extra 20 min because they gave your food away to someone else bc its one of there friends I seen it happen before so many times to others second time experiencing it myself"}
{"text":"Honestly- the walk in special for $19.99 with a large side is so worth it.  Their rice tastes a bit like afghan style (think baamiyan kebab). Their chicken grilled well almost like an improved Nando's and their option of sauces are great as well.  I think this franchise is doing really well and as long as they keep the prices competitive as it is. This location will be a success as well. Really enjoyed the food here.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We enjoy the chicken and friendly counter service. It is not a place for quick service but the quality of the food is worth the wait. Since it is Halal everyone in my circle can enjoy and no one is excluded. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location since they opened and the service/food is usually really good. I've had one or two bad experiences but not enough to put me off from this restaurant.  I'm a huge fan of the steak sandwich especially on Fridays where its the special and you can get a combo for around 10$. This place is very reasonable price wise for the portions you get. I am absolutely  in love with their peri peri sauce I just can't help eating endless amounts of fries with it it's just so good! Would highly recommend this chain."}
{"text":"I've been to this chain more times than I can count, but this was my first time at this location. The restaurant layout was very nice and extremely clean compared to other locations. The service was also wonderful. The music playing created a nice ambience as well.  As for the food, it was presented very well and made it look mouth watering from the get go. I ordered a steak sandwich with peri fries and it was amazing. The steak was cooked perfectly and wasn't too rubbery and the sandwich was spiced accordingly sometimes I find the sandwich is so spicy that it destroys your tastebuds for days to come. But not this time !   Overall I would recommend this restaurant to all especially those of you who love spicy foods and may be up for a challenge."}
{"text":"Came here today as I was craving for some flame-grilled chicken, and was so glad I did! The place was almost empty as we came around 2 PM on a Saturday.  Since this is my first time here, me and my BF decided to get their quarter chicken with one side combo ($6.99). I got my chicken with lemon peri flavor and my BF got his with suicide peri flavor.  We didn't wait that long for our food to come, maybe 5-8 minutes and I was surprised at how large the side is!! Overall the serving is pretty good for what you pay.  The lemon peri chicken is awesome, there is a hint of spiciness and it is a little bit spicier than the Lemon Herb sauce at Nando's. Chicken is fresh, tasty, and the side is pretty good too!  Their suicide sauce is good, very flavorful, if you can withstand a fair amount of heat!  We also decided to order 2 more pieces of fried chicken for $3.99. You have a choice of hot or mild. Be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes for this, as they make it fresh.. when the food finally came, we were impressed by the crispiness of the skin. I believe their fried chicken is better than their grilled chicken but both types are definitely a must-try. The fried chicken tastes really, really good.  I would come back to try other items in their menu as they have a lot of offerings. Service is friendly and the restaurant is clean.    Review 18 of 100"}
{"text":"Love the food! Especially the peri peri chicken sandwich.  Best part is you get to control your spice level which is awesome.  Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I came to Chick Fiesta expecting decent Portuguese chicken and left a tad disappointed. Personally I am a huge fan of Portuguese chicken and found that the quality of Chick Fiesta is not up to par as some other places. While I haven't tried too many Portuguese chicken places here in the GTA, I have had my fair share in Montreal, where I had absolutely phenomenal chicken.  I ordered the half-chicken meal which came with one side for $11.99 before taxes. That's a pretty good value compared to Nandos, which you can only get a quarter for the same price. I was expecting a complete half-chicken, not chicken pieces and this is one problem for me. While the flavoring of the chicken was good - good amount of spices and their piri-piri sauce is pretty decent as well, the chicken failed to impress me. It was just average, the chicken could have been more juicy and the lack of crispy skin or even skin in general led to the unsavouryness of it. That being said, the chicken was grilled pretty well. I was also pretty disappointed with their potatoes as well, and their combination with the lemon piri-piri sauce just didn't work at all.   It looks like the east end is devoid of any phenomenal chicken places, so my search continues for great Portuguese chicken. Looks like I'm off to Mississauga."}
{"text":"Good service and fresh food ... suicide sauce not so spicy but pain in butt for days .. spice in sauce has kick but you can still taste food ... their steak platter comes with 2 tbones for $19 .. place is clean"}
{"text":"Always complained how there weren't any Portugese Chicken places in Scarborough and then this place opened up. The flame grilled chicken is great. I've had their Peri sauces from lemon to hot and they're all good. The rice is also very good and is seasoned with what seems to be an African mixture of spices. They have a whole chicken special for $14.99."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The peri peri chicken they serve is always made to perfection! I always get the 'hot' level of spice for their chicken and its definitely spicy!  The walk in special for $20 for a whole chicken and large side is definitely a steal as well!"}
{"text":"Watch out Nando's, you got competition! I stumbled across this place in search of my next meal and am I glad that I I did!  This seems to be Scarboroughs answer to Nando's Portuguese chicken... Let me tell you, the flavors are out-of-this-world delicious! It's located in a little ghetto strip mall but don't let that fool you... This place is a must-try! For just over $7 I was left feeling extremely satisfied. I ordered two pieces of chicken with Peri Peri fries and was brave enough to try spicy level hot... my mouth was burning but my heart was smiling.  If you're looking for a fantastic and cheap place to eat I would highly recommend this place... Maybe try medium spice level unless you're up for a bit of a challenge  Overall strongly recommend, I'll definitely be back! 5/5"}
{"text":"Had late dinner here tonight:  12 pcs fried chicken, dark meat, with  1 regular side & 1 pop. $19.99  Whole grilled chicken with 1 large side. $19.99  Crunchy.  Juicy.  Halal.  Well-seasoned. Reasonably-priced. Cooked fresh/made-to-order."}
{"text":"Chicken here is better than Nandos, very flavory and tender! Corn is buttery and refreshing, they add lemon juice in it.  I tried the hot level and the waitress warned me it gonna be very spicy, but it turns out to be very good and not very salty. Next time I'll try the suicide spicy. Price is solid, will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and the food is good. I like their Peri rice.  The restaurant inside has seating and is bigger than your average Popeyes.   I posted the menu for you. You're welcome!!  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I got the mild half chicken with peri fries  Now usually I'd go for anything more lemon flavoured but I decided to go with mild. What I liked about this heat level is that it had lemon in it as well as spice. Warning: mild is spicy so I wouldn't order spicy, unless you can handle it that is.  The fries are my fave, as you can see I've checked in twice, I keep coming back!   The chicken is so juicy and tender, cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"The chicken was very flavourful. However a little on the spicier end. Even the mild sauce was quite spicy. The price is decent compared to Nandos.  Can't comment on service as we only did takeout."}
{"text":"Service 4/5 friendly and informative.   Price 4/5 $10 for 1 meal  Location 3/5 free parking. On a plaza  Food 4/5 they have their sauce   Will be back"}
{"text":"Juicy, delicious and flavorful grilled chicken. Hands down best Portuguese Grilled chicken in Toronto! Way better then Nandos. Honestly we haven't found anything that compares for the price and flavour!"}
{"text":"How did this place get 4 star rating? I believe it's the local family and friends. True Yelpers will rate this between a 1-2 at the max. Went there on a instinct while I was driving through Markham and saw some good reviews and hey it's chicken right? Anyhow the chicken ended being below quality, the grilling I liked... but no flavour at all. Nothing. So added more sauce and meh.the potatoes were a joke I tossed it. And rice was ok  . Definitely not going here for Portuguese chicken..."}
