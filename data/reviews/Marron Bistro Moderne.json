{"text":"No words. They should have sent a poet.  I came here for a work holiday party last night. We booked the entire restaurant and it was the perfect size. We were about 20 people, and there was a coat check and a little bar set up with room to stand around. The tables were arranged in a circle with an opening so the servers could go into the circle and provide the food.   The food was AMAZING. Apparently our work set it up so that the restaurant knew how many people were coming and our food sensitivities (dairy, nut and seed allergy, kosher and halal people, people that don't eat red meat... we're quite the bunch) and just set up a menu for us. The owner came out before the food was served and had a little speech \"We cook with a lot of fat, so if you're on a diet... you're in the wrong place.\" I knew this was a good sign.  It was tapas style, and we had :  Beet and endive salad (great balance of slightly bitter and sweet) Quinoa and tomato salad with pea shoots Sweet potato and something soup Potato and meat croquettes (so good!) Lamb sausage Mini burgers Chicken schnitzel (perfectly crispy and tender) Tandoori chicken Sea bass (light, buttery and perfectly cooked) Lamb chop (amazing) Slow cooked beef rib, which they put on a table in the middle and carved in front of us (amazing flavour and tender as hell) Roasted potatoes Roasted root vegetables Dessert that was: mini dark chocolate lava cake (LOVED), custard in a pastry, dairy-free ice cream with fresh fruit  Everything was either good or absolutely amazing. It was a marathon of food and wine. I was in absolute heaven. The atmosphere was cozy and the service was spot on. It couldn't have been a better experience.  Apparently, it's not uncommon for people to call a few days ahead and ask them to create a special menu for them. I have no idea what it cost, but I'm definitely going to be back."}
{"text":"Went back to Marron for dinner with my wife the other night.   As usual the menu has changed into more of a modern bistro Tapas menu.  The food was awesome and being a Wednesday night the second seating wasn't too busy. Here's what we had:  Smoked Duck - came on a bed of pear sauce/butter, pistachios and topped with some green and a smoked mini-Anjou pear. This dish is not very large but the flavours pop in your mouth!  Steak Tartar - this is not your ordinary steak tartar... with a blend of savoury and sweet flavours mixed into a melt in your mouth Taratar... You get three servings, I could have had a dozen it was so good.  Flatiron Steak Salad - who knew that salad could be so good.  Great produce, amazing tomatoes and a sliced cold flatiron steak cooked to perfection.  Ok, i'll have this one again too.  Great services, Great food, why wouldn't you go again!  I will!"}
