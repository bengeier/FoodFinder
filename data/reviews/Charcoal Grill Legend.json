{"text":"It's not as authentic as other places but good enough that it's my third time here.   A lot of BBQ items are fried first and then put on grill which gives that crusty feel, a lot of other places do the same I guess to save time which is definitely not a good way.

The most famous one is in Scarborough called Yang's BBQ, this place is definitely not on par with that as that one is way more authentic.  You can actually tell by the number of people, this place isn't busy anymore but Yang's BBQ has been busy for years.

It's an ok choice for you want Chinese BBQ in the Markham area, we sometimes drive down to Yang's BBQ but when we just want something quick we come here.

Lots of selections but mainly I've only tried their BBQ items.  Overall it's an 'OK', meaning will still come back but not something that I would be craving for it"}
{"text":"This charcoal place was highly recommended by a friend of my mine who is a chef, so I thought this place is worthwhile for a try.  I made the reservation before hand as it can be quite busy.  The decor, let's say is not on the classy and elegant spectrum.  It is more rustic, but I think it is still quite reasonably clean.  

I love lamb skewers and it must be the favourite food of mine out of any other food.  The lamb skewers with the authentic charcoal flavour were really nicely done with a slightly toasted cumin aroma.  They were really good, but I wish there was slightly more fat to make the meat slightly more moist and tender.  The sweer and sour pork was really crispy with a wonderful syrupy sauce, with tangy and sweet taste.

 The squid skewer, what must I say, I used too much force to try to extract it from the skewer, and its head jumped directly onto the floor rather than into my tummy.  What a shame.  Lol!  All the other skewers were really wonderfully done with he chicken heart was really good along.  The chicken cartilage was not bad.  With the sour and spicy thinly julienned potatoes, and couple of pitcher of beer to finish off the meal.  

I have been craving for good lamb skewers for a while, and this place did satisfied my craving.  The price was reasonable and I really appreciate thia great friend of ours to treat us expectedly.  It was a meal to remember.  If not for the decor not being what I expect, I would give this place a 5/5."}

{"text":"This was a newly opened restaurant in this very famous food plaza in markham. it is a bbq restaurant focused on northern chinese bbq food. We had went there for a lunch. First thing is when we entered we found that it was empty during lunch time, which is usually not a good sign, but we relented and figured they are new perhaps it would still be good. 

we tried several dishes, including a sesame cold noodle. which is a very popular dish that is served in many restaurants. The first problem is that the dish is too sweet. they added too much sugar to it, and on top for the price they charge it was very tiny, so you definitely are not getting a lot of bang for your buck. 

The next couple dishes we ordered was bbq beef/lamb/fish/mushrooms. these were all okay, the meat quality was fine, but again they added a lot more sugar then you usually do to the spices used for this type of bbq. the meat quality was decent, but definietly too sweet, and the price was more expensive then other bbq places. at 5.99 for a set, which is a lot more pricey then other places that charge 3.99 or less.  The mushroom was too sweet. and not a great dish to have  as it is supposed to be savory. 

Overall this restaurant did not meet our expectations and for the price and size and quality it is definitely not a place i would recommend to anyone. The sugar content is one of the biggest problem in the restaurant, since it is too much and is on for some reason seemingly every dish. 

The service at the restaurant was normal, nothing spectacular or bad."}
{"text":"7 Dollar pitchers. How do you get away with that?
Food is as dirty and greasy as dirty chinese food gets. Perfect 10/10
There's a TV where you can watch chinese singing competitions. No audio though 10/10 Nice"}
{"text":"This is a Chinese restaurant specializing on charcoal kebabs. The authentic cumin spice makes the kebabs very tasty. But the food is very pricey compared to other Asian restaurants in Markham. 

I ordered tofu, lamb, chicken, rib, potato and bread. The rib kebab was still rare inside. Also,  not many pork options are offered. (I was expecting streaky pork) The kebab menu is just lack of variety.  however there are other stuffs on the menu, such as noodles and entrees. 

They take credit and debit cards. But there will be an extra charge to credit cards."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here about once a week, sometimes more. The lamb skewers are delicious and so is the shredded potato. A pitcher of beer is $8, yes a pitcher! Dishes I would recommend ordering your first time there is the beef, lamb skewers and shredded potato dish, which is spicy (Szechwan peppers). The chicken skewers are also okay but not always consistent. However, I would definitely recommend this place to everyone, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My sister and her boyfriend were raving about this place and finally got me to come with them.

I'm just going to start off saying that I hated it. & don't get me wrong the food wasn't horrible - it was the cleanliness. 
It had the vibe of where you just want to bring your own utensils because everything felt extremely dirty.  
This was later supported by my boyfriend finding 2 hairs in separate dishes of food.  A tiny short hair on the little pancake thing and then a long long long long hair in our fried rice.  
The grilled items weren't bad: squid, chicken heart, beef, lamb, although the chicken was a little dry.  But after finding the 2nd hair - I just dropped my chopsticks. 

Long story short - I would rather pay more for the same food if it was in a cleaner environment."}
{"text":"Lunch Special?

The waitress did not even know that lunch special existed until I pointed to the posters on the windows. Should I be worry??

Braised Beef Soup Noodle ($6.99) was a good size but tasted bland and forgettable. Maybe I should stick with grilled items? The restaurant is named Grill Legend?

Just a really confusing experience. I got more confused when the waitress asked me if I wanted soy milk or soup. Then came back and said my order did not come with that....

Will I be back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Decent bbq skewer restaurant at decent prices :)

Nothing is too spicy. The lamb skewers are almost perfect for me (with low spice tolerance) priced at $4.99/ 4 skewers!
The white fish skewer is fresh and moist coated by a thin crisp flavorful skin ($4.99 / 3 skewers).
The lamb noodle soup broth is rich and delicious. 
The scallops were my favorite, utterly delicious, although a little pricey at $2.99 per scallop!
Not a fan of the chicken wings.

I'll definitely return to try other dishes on the menu, next time ill post a picture of their menu, its updated with many more dishes from the one currently available on yelp. ;)"}
{"text":"This is the Chinese style grill and northern Chinese style authentic dishes. The food taste as authentic as it gets. Have had tried all the Chinese grill in New York Chinatown/ flushing/ Edison, this is one the best for sure!"}
{"text":"Man, come here for their BBQ skewers. Though they're not as flavourful as some other better known Chinese BBQ restaurants, their skewers are extremely cheap for what it's worth. My friend and I assumed it was 3.99 for 2 pieces because that's generally the price for lamb skewers at other places so we made an order of 4, since we were very hungry. Turns out it was 3.99 for 4 pieces!! That's insane, that's basically $1 per piece. Which meant we received 16 pieces. Such a good price for lamb skewers. We obviously didn't finish them though, but worth if you're going with big groups. 

We also ordered the spicy boiled fish. It would've been amazing with rice given that it was too salty on its own, but with our millions of skewers, we did not have enough stomach for rice. I also ordered a side of BBQ chives which was unfortunately saltier than my haters on overwatch. But anyway, do not get their noodle soups; soup was ridiculously bland and noodles soggy af. 

Service was surprisingly good for how typical Chinese it was. Would definitely come back for more skewers!"}
