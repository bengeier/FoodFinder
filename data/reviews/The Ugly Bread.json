{"text":"The pho was too sweet compared to traditional pho. It is good enough to satisfy a pho craving in this area of town. Still need to try the banh mi and other menu items to see if it is any good. It's nice and clean inside with a chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Presently, The Ugly Bread is set up to order at the counter and then go sit down with your number. The pho was pretty good, but I was not able to just have Pho Tai. It is cooked with the meatballs in the broth. Just not a fan of meatballs. At the table, there was some confusion from the waiter about who got what. Being our first time, we weren't familiar with the bowls. However, the supersize didn't look much bigger than the regular size. Bowls of pho are more expensive than our regular Pineville and Charlotte Vietnamese places. Plates of vegetables (jalapeno, bean sprouts, basil) were giving to each person with pho, not to the table to share. That was a very nice touch. 

The guy who took our order, possibly the owner, said there would be a new menu and, I believe, ordering from the table in the near future.

Next time I plan to get the bun with shrimp and grilled pork, if possible. I also plan to get some of those great looking baked goods to go."}
{"text":"We went during grand opening weekend. Service was great, they had issues with taking orders, payment. We ordered the banh mi's. It is definitely overpriced compared to other vietnamese sandwich shop (Lee's Sandwich) in Noda. Bread was a bit hard and dry and not enough meat was added. Also it wasn't as seasoned as what I'm used too. Again, service was great but food was just alright."}
{"text":"Lovely little place! Spotlessly clean. Very fresh. Gracious and sweet service. Great experience ! Come to Southpark.....

Lots of vegetarian /vegan options"}
{"text":"I am a little new to Vietnamese food so it's hard for me to determine the authenticity.  However, the building has been renovated and is very clean with a nice atmosphere. I had an steak dish with vegetables and.  It was good and affordably priced.  The desert, carrot cake, was amazing.  I would defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Some of the best pho I've ever had.  Used to live in NYC and this was always one of my go-to meals at multiple different places.  This place, in my opinion, absolutely stacks up against the others I've been too and is a gem in Monroe.  Highly recommend you try.  Egg rolls and spring rolls are great, service is super friendly and they make their own bread and pastries.

as the kids say, legit af.

ETA: NOOOOOO!!!!  Pulled in the other day and they've closed!  So bummed!  :("}
{"text":"This place is both awesome and Incredibly confusing. They moved into an old Mexican restaurant and put quite a bit of time into the renovation. As a result, it is light and Airy and very clean when you walk in. The menu is not expensive, you can basically choose between a rice based dish, a noodle based dish, pho, or sandwiches. So far I've had the rice and noodle dishes and they were very good. The vegetables are extremely fresh and the noodles and rice were well-prepared and savory.

Here's the confusing part, it is also a REALLY good American Bakery. I have never had better carrot cake, and his macarons are as good as any I've had all over the country. This is a dichotomy because Monroe is not well known for its fresh and Innovative food or bakeries.

In a few months he's been open, it's clear he is modifying his menu and has added a few vegetarian options that weren't there on my original visit. I suspect that Trend will continue as he gets a better feel for what people are looking for. I should also mention he offers smoothies and Shakes, which I may be wrong but I don't think so, is the only place in Monroe to offer those at this time.

I am giving this 5 stars because it is currently my favorite restaurant in Monroe , simply because  the food is fresh, the service is good,  and they are clearly trying  to offer something you can't find anywhere else in Monroe. If you are not a fan of the same old chain restaurants or deep fat fried everything, I would suggest you give the ugly bread a try because I think you will enjoy it immensely."}
{"text":"Was surprised when I showed up for dinner to find that the Ugly Bread  is no more.  PERMANENTLY CLOSED!"}
{"text":"This is a delightful Vietnamese and Thai noodle house. I had the chicken pho. Nice large portion. I will definitely be back. The sandwiches looked good too."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and helpful when ordering. Great food. Going back soon. Loved the spring rolls and pho. Wish there were more choices on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is beyond excellent! The food is fresh and very authentic. All the breads and pastries are made from scratch and are exceptional! The staff is welcoming and the atmosphere is nice inside. We had the Pho, spring rolls and deserts. All were exceptional!"}
{"text":"Went back for the pho and it was even better than the banh mi. Now I've gotta go back for the new spicy pork belly!"}
{"text":"We were in Monroe and decided to have lunch at a local restaurant. The reviews for Ugly bread looked good and we had not had Vietnamese for a while. 

It was delicious! We ordered the Spicy chicken Co'm and the Spicy Pork Co'm. It was a little warm but nothing the veggies in the plate couldn't handle. 

Dessert? Why, yes please. We had Macaroons and a crème brûlée cheesecake. Yum! 

I am so glad we took the chance on this little local place. Too bad we don't live closer, we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Enjoy the experience of eating some fresh food prepared daily and great change instead of the regular food chains.

The approach to baking with better ingredient vs. overly sweet cakes and other pastries.

A little place that makes us enjoy their foods enjoyed daily from their country .

Welcome to their kitchen table!"}
{"text":"I love that Monroe has this new and different food to bring to monroe. The food was super fresh and left me satisfied. The beef stir fry com was awesome and had a good flavor. The egg rolls are so out of this world that I had to buy more. Everyone should try it out. It's a clean and chic environment with the decor."}
{"text":"An amazing addition to Monroe. This restaurant is fantastic. It is casual, yet the decor is so fancy and unique. A great place to come for a date, with friends, or family. They are right off of Hwy 74 so pretty easy to get to and seem to have plenty of parking around the building. I thought the menu selection was kind of small but I think they cover the basics and they also have a chalkboard display of their daily specials. In addition, they offer an array of delicious desserts you would not usually expect at a Vietnamese restaurant (e.g. macaroons, cupcakes, chocolates, just to name a few). I had the stir-fry beef bun and was able to taste the beef pho. Both were fresh, visually pleasing, well-proportioned, and smelled amazing. I have to say, the pho was the best I have had and I will definitely be back to get my own bowl. The service was impeccable."}
{"text":"What a great find!  The staff was attentive and did a great job explaining the dishes.  I tried the beef bun and it was picture perfect in presentation and delicious!  Bonus, macarons in so many flavors.  The pistachio was sooo good.  Will try again the next time I am in Monroe."}
{"text":"My brother and I visited 8/11/17 for lunch. Neither of us had had Vietnamese food before but wanted to try it. We were glad we did. I had the House Special Bahn Mi which is the Vietnamese version of a submarine sandwich. It came with roast beef, ham and turkey on a fresh-baked sub roll. They make their own bread in the store; it is not ugly but it is very good as was the sandwich itself.
I also had egg rolls (2 for $4.95) which were crispy, fresh and delicious.
My brother had a huge bowl of Pho which is a soup consisting of a won-ton type flavorful broth, strips of beef, vegetables and rice noodles. He said it was excellent. That is what I am getting next time I go and I will definetly go again.
The restaurant has been completely redecorated with all new seating, tables, chairs and interior decorations - very nice looking and comfortable.
To sum up - a really good place to eat especially when you want to try something other than hamburgers, fries and a diet coke. Go ahead, try something besides the same stuff all the time."}
{"text":"Please post your holiday hours on yelp. My family and I checked yelp on Easter Sunday and nothing out of the norm was noted. We drove there and it was closed. You had a noted posted on the door but it was a wasted trip for us."}
{"text":"First time here today. Had the lemon grass chicken sandwich which was amazing. Flavors were just incredible. Wife had the pho soup with chicken and she was very happy as well. Very happy that Monroe has another good restaurant now. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Ugly Bread should be renamed to Manna from Heaven!
This restaurant is fabulous! I ordered various menu items to try across the spectrum. Everything was so good and so fresh it is worth coming to in a downpour as I did. The service is great and all I encountered there were very helpful and accommodating. Here's what I tried and would highly recommend:
Beef Pho - amazingly fresh and flavorful with all the freshest garnishments. The beef was superb.
Spring rolls - Huge, delicious and again, amazingly fresh.
Mango Smoothie with Boba - Fresh and homemade and absolutely delicious.
Macaron - Tried the cream cheese macaron and it is to die for. One of the best I have had from around the country. Better than Amelie's local chain in Charlotte area.
Creme Brulee Cheesecake - Fresh and delicious; not overpowering.
Chocolate cake - haven't yet tried but I expect nothing less than the stellar results of all the above.
I hope people in the area will give this lovely restaurant a try. Believe me you will be sold and return time and again.
I'm bringing my brother-in-law here when he's in town next week, I carried out this time, but will eat in with him.
I cannot say enough good about this wonderful new gem in Monroe. It's a foodie's delight. Could you open a site in Seattle? It would do super well there."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite items to order is the lemongrass chicken bahn mi and the sweet potato tots. Both are packed with flavor! The service there is also spectacular."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times already and the food is consistently great!! I get the shrimp fried rice and the stir-fry beef sandwich!! I've tried the tres leches cake, 3 colors dessert, macroons, and key lime pie. All were delicious!! It's clean, reasonably priced, and the decor is beautiful!! All the employees are soooo nice...they greet you at the door and make you feel like family!! I recommend this restaurant to all!!"}
{"text":"This place was way overpriced for sandwiches. And so so food. Don't get a cup of water because it costs $2.80."}
{"text":"Hardest part was finding the door to enter the restaurant. 

When facing the build it's on the left in the middle. 
Kids loved the blue light and pergola!

Food 
House bun- always good 
Spicy grilled pork with rice- awesome
Spring rolls- good
Vietnamese Ice coffee- uhhh delicious 
Chicken with rice- kids shared 
Pho house- good 
Macaroon- very enjoyable 
Tres leches- good 

Great food, but the service was slow for us being the only people there. However, my party was not the most pleasant to wait on either."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4 times since the opening and every time has been excellent. The food is so fresh and authentic. I just moved from L.A and have tried a lot of Pho, who knew that I'd find my favorite Pho in Monroe, NC. The spring rolls are amazing and the Pork Bahn Mi is great. The Vietnamese coffee is also fantastic. I'm so happy The Ugly Bread has opened and has exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"love the pho and there drinks very friendly employees have been there twice but will def go more often"}
{"text":"Delicious..veggie pho and house special bahn mi both wonderful. Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Great new Vietnamese restaurant off Hwy 74. Friendly and attentive employees. The food was great! My husband and I both had the pho and we enjoyed their macarons for dessert. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here, I've been watching the renovation waiting for them to open. The vibe is great, a cool Asian/euro fusion bistro type setting. The pho is great, rivals the best in Charlotte without a question. The pastry case is gorgeous and we ordered a chocolate cake to go because there was no way we could eat an entire bowl of pho plus dessert. Can't wait to come back for a Banh Mi later this week."}
{"text":"If you are getting take out, leave a little tip anyway. I've attached a photo that shows how nicely and carefully they packaged my order, two beef soups, three egg rolls, and an order of spring rolls. 

Only pho place in Monroe, but still very good. I feel blessed to have them here."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem! Monroe is so lucky to have this new addition to the area. 
We had the pork bún and the beef phó and they were both incredible. I'm a long time fan of Vietnamese and have had my fair share of both dishes in my time and this is some of the best I've had. 
Also had the spring rolls and they were INCREDIBLE. So fresh and tasty. 
I love the addition of the in house baked goods. We had the blackberry and lemon macarons. *swoon* so tasty! 
We will definitely be back again and again. Wishing this place the best of luck!"}
{"text":"We visited my sister and her family. My brother-in-law took us here for dinner. By the name, you can't tell that you are going to a Vietnames restaurant. My husband and I were totally surprised. The restaurant was very nice and in a nice location and it has a bakery with macroons. I love the decorations inside. My husband, sister and brother-in-law ordered the beef pho. The kids and I ordered the com beef and chicken dishes. My sister purchased 4 macarons to take home

Pros: The food was good with good portion size. My husband was happy with his beef pho. The service was excellent. Our waiter was always checking in on us. The chef also came out to greet us. The prices was comparable to all the Vietnamese restaurants I've been to.

Cons: none

Recommendation: Oh yes if you are looking for good Vietnamese food in Monroe."}
{"text":"Very nicely renovated and looks great inside. Service was great. Husband really enjoyed the pho. Egg rolls were fantastic. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is our second visit to this place. We are visiting from out of town. The service is very friendly and quick. My husband had the special spicy chicken bahn mi with fries. I had the super size beef pho. Together we shared the pork egg rolls. The egg rolls were AMAZING!! Best egg rolls we have had in any restaurant! My husband devoured his sandwich. States it was very delicious! My soup was a never ending bowl of a perfect blend of noodles and meat!!! I am a huge pho snob and this is by far my favorite place to get my home country soup!!!"}
{"text":"We tried this last night ... A hidden gem great food and the lady behind the bar was very helpful to explain the menu. Lemongrass Chicken was AWESOME!! Also was the lemongrass tofu. Couple ideas to get over the akwardness of being new have your servers bring all the food at one time. I think don't make it look like a fast food make sure your servers bring flatware and request for water when you first sit down."}
