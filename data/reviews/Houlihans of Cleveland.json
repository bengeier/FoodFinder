{"text":"Enjoyed cocktails and dinner in patio. Only downside was slow service - appeared to be short staffed other than that enjoyable and great meals at our whole table"}
{"text":"Easter Buffet - what a find!  Priced fair. The kids raved about the shrimp bisque.    Everything including omelets to salmon to carving station roast beef and ham.  Waffles, dessert, bloody Mary bar.  We will be back next Easter and in between."}
{"text":"If you get food poisoning do you rate with 1 star or no stars?  I ordered the pot roast. It was fatty and disgusting. I nibbled at it anyway as i was hungry. Big mistake. I ended up with food poisoning that seemed like it would kill me. When I called to tell them and ask for apology they were indifferent and said tough luck. A drink on the patio might be ok but I would never eat any food there."}
{"text":"Are you fricking kidding me???  First you drop the Mac n Cheese?  Then you drop the Tilapia?  Now you drop the Panko Breaded Shrimp?  What's next? Water?  Or worse yet, the Chocolate Cappuccino Cake?  Who's making these decisions anyway??"}
