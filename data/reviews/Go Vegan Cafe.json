{"text":"Wow! Such good food, and tons of raw variety too. 

We walked in at around 4pm and since it's an odd time to go get lunch or dinner we were basically the only table. The owner or manager came and chatted with us, explained the menu, the variety items and such.

The food did not take long to arrive and when it did I jumped right into my plate. It was simply amazing. All fresh ingredients, sauces made in house, beautiful presentation and the taste of every single item was well beyond my expectations.

We tried a few desert bites as well. They have a nice selection of resources- books and products for the vegan lifestyle. There's also raw food preparation classes the first Saturday of every month for those like me that need a few more ideas when cooking at home. 

I loved everything and I really can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Loved the burger! Although I wish the place stayed open a little longer."}
{"text":"Went an ate here with my girlfriend and her best friend yesterday....and we all were impressed with the vibe of the place... the food was very very good.... definitely coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent, individual size but filling portions and tasty recipe. Would recommend. Very laid back."}
{"text":"I am not vegan, but before orthodox easter, every year I go \"vegan\" for 49 days. staff was super welcoming, I loved everything I had there. All my vegan craving were satisfied))"}
{"text":"Very consistent and reliable place to order from, in contrast to others in the Vegas area; they never mess up the orders, which is a problem we have encountered with a few other spots around that deliver. The food is of Excellent quality and very flavorful, the portion sizes are a good size so you get your money's worth. Also the menu is very diverse so you have plenty to choose from... I would highly recommend the jackfruit dishes and the burgers, although everything I have tried so far has been very good... the smoothies are good too."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. The menu is varied and with all of my favorite comfort foods. But... there were a couple of things that just couldn't be overlooked. I found the service to be perfectly fine so no complaints there. True, the ambiance leaves a lot to be desired, but I can overlook that if the food is amazing. But it wasn't quite amazing. The first huge indiscretion is that along with my tofu scramble I was served a ketchup that had honey in it. I'm only plant-based and not vegan so I was ok with that but this is unacceptable for a place that has vegan in its name, and many people would have rightfully been angry about this. Also, the tofu scramble and potatoes were unnecessarily oily. After I cleaned my plate (it was actually very good), there was a thick layer of oil all over my plate. I understand using a little oil but when you can taste it as a dominant flavor in a dish you've gone too far. The apple muffin, however, was delicious and perfect. I will come back soon because I'm guessing there are some real winners on the menu. I'll just ask if they can use a *lot* lighter of a hand with the oil next time."}
{"text":"I\"ve past this restaurant past 8 months, but finally stop now there's less construction blocking their entrance! Great service with no wait, great food, pleasant atmosphere! Love the Mex-Burger with sweet potatoe fries. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love the food! Had the Italian Burger with waffle fries.... Delicious! Had a excellent server named Misty who was very informative and happy. Her passion about the vegan lifestyle made our entire experience at Go Vegan wonderful. We will return when we come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Omg. I LOVE go vegan. This little gem inspires me to drag myself out of bed, put on leggings, drive across town and eat to my tummies content today it was the gf pancakes with mixed berries that called to me and I'm taking food to go. Thank you go vegan"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Same owners as Go Raw so you know they deliver! Great location and beautiful patio!!"}
{"text":"Calling all vegans if you feel like some good quality vegan food this is the place to go to, everything is organic and the variety would please a meat eater too"}
{"text":"Great food, had breakfast waffle and tofu omelet, everything tasted great.  Nice quiet atmosphere, good location. Want to come back and try the burgers."}
{"text":"Healthy sure,  but not too tasty. It is also very pricey. The older gentleman at the register is not very friendly and doesn't smile. He seems exhausted. It's a slow Sunday. Probably under staffed because no one has checked on me. This place doesn't make me want to \"go vegan.\" Not worth the money. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We got the Asian burger and build your own pizza. It was flavorful and delicious!!! Will definitely return. 

Negatives: would like pizza little more baked/toasted and the Mediterranean salad was bland. Most important they had NO A/C. It was uncomfortable to eat during the summer with no a/c. This was not good. Customers need to be cooled down to enjoy their good food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty, calming, nice restrooms and amazing food! Yuuum will come again"}
{"text":"Food is a bit pricey in my honest opinion. Staff is helpful explaining food options from the menu and various other food displays throughout the Cafe. The hosts at the Cafe can sometimes come across as too nosy and want to know a lot personal information from customers such as background and various other demographic inquiries raised when paying at the register. Nice experience overall but pretty expensive for the portions received."}
{"text":"Elegant , clean great service and great price.
The Kung Pao three is spiced just right. The food is plentiful. The ambience is peaceful.
I enjoy the experience each time."}
{"text":"When visiting Vegas this is an absolutely must! Food was amazing, service was great. Their menu is full of a ton of options depending on what your craving. They also have a section in their cafe that has books and learning tools about vegan diets. Definitely recommend this cafe!"}
{"text":"I really want to go back and try the food. But the smoothie we ordered while not being cheap was amazing and exactly what we were lookin for. I left happy."}
{"text":"Well hmmm!! The service was on par, the food tasted alright and the ambiance was tranquil. Hence the 3 stars!

However, I wish there was more lighting at night on the exterior so that we can see the restaurant from the road as it was hard to spot at night. The portions of our food were \"what I am not used to seeing at other vegan places.\" I had the classic burger with waffle fries. Normally when I go to vegan places the amount of fries I get is pretty generous. At this location I had maybe about 8-10 pieces of fries spread out on my plate which were small pieces a couple pieces were the size of a half dollar while the remaining 6-8 pieces were the size of a quarter. It was not packed on like I am used to at other vegan restaurants so when I received the food I was in a little shock. Not worth the price I paid for, for that meal. The dessert selections were alright.

I may be back to give this place a shot again!"}
{"text":"We came on a Monday for lunch and sad to see the restaurant was empty but happy for the speedy service. We ordered the Mexi burger with sweet potato fries. With its SoCal/Mex flavor was warm, fresh and spiced just right. The raw mediterranean burger with avocado fries was rich with full crispy veggies. The avocado fries were my least favorite but still done well. Go Vegan!!! Yay for Vegas for such a healthy vegan"}
{"text":"First time here and won't be my last.  Loved the veggie wrap I got to go. Fair prices and found out they deliver yay!!!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly, relaxed and helpful. My husband ordered the kimchi burger and liked it as well as the cheese fries which were delicious. I ordered the tamale plate but the rice and beans smelled and tasted rancid so I skipped over it and kept to the tamale which tasted like the kind you'd find in the freezer aisle of a market. The cheese pizzas we ordered were the Daiya cheese pizzas you could also get at the store, if you're lucky to find it. The only thing I really LOVED was the chocolate cake that had cherries in it which was delicious with the frosting on the cake. But everything is rather overpriced for tasting like freezer food. I am planning on going back but will probably only order their raw food and smoothies/juice as I'm sure it's got to be made in house."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the unfortunate circumstance of entering the stank and lifeless tomb, please be sure to not poke the zombie owner in search of your favorite fresh juice. Twice we had gone there to get juice. And twice we had encountered the very surly and customer-unfriendly owner of the establishment who looked as if he is just been awakened from a long and restless sleep. Please, understand that as a customer of this place, you are not allowed to have what you want. You will have to get what they give you instead. In case you wish to protest- the mean spirited owner we have dealt with twice - will shot down and refuse the service.
  I ordered the green juice. A young waiter took the order and charged the card. I asked if they had all the ingredients ( kale, celery, cucumber, parsley, spinach, collard greens). The waiter asked me for the menu back and looked at the ingredients. He acknowledged that they were out of collard greens. He offered to add extra kale instead. I insisted on substituting the missing product with parsley. He agreed and noted it on the order. As he started working on it- the juicer jammed due to not being properly cleaned. The owner came with a lug wrench, took apart the juicer, and cleaned it. After about 15-20 min the juicer was fixed. Then the owner decided to clean up the bar area. It took him another 7 min. In no time did they offer water or such. In fact, the old grouchy owner told us to go elsewhere cause he didn't feel comfortable with us watching him. When he did eventually start making juice, we discovered WHY he didn't want us watching him. He started to fill the juicer with celery sticks and kale, totally ignoring my request about extra parsley instead of missing herb. After we tried to stop him by reminding that we ordered extra parsley -  he immediately stopped, threw the remaining celery stick in the trash and replied ' how about I just give you the money back?!' To which we gladly said 'ok!' 
  Luckily, we escaped this dark and gloomy establishment. NEVER to return!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Just ordered take out from this place and was blown away.. Was in a bleh mood, not really hungry but Hubby wanted take out, so suggested trying out this place. The food (we ordered enchiladas, mex burger and kale salad) was so good, i got greedy and over ate! Looking  forward to trying it out again."}
{"text":"Food is very very good  Place is beautiful and family friendly, definitely our favorite spot"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place... But sadly I was mistaken. As soon as I walked in the girls working there started talking about me in Spanish. I'm light skinned so they assumed I wasn't Hispanic, but I understood every word... Especially the part where they called me fat and overweight. When I responded in Spanish the worker looked at me with a dumb face and said she didn't speak Spanish... I am never returning because I don't think it's okay to judge people, especially when I am trying being healthier.  (Side note: I am nowhere near being fat or overweight) The employers should be more respectful towards customers."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas with a couple of friends, and although it was a trip from the strip, this place was well worth it. The food was fresh, flavorful, and delicious! Every dish we tried, we liked.
The server was on point with her recommendations, everything she suggested to us, ended up being our favorites! We tried many things on the menu (the server doubted our ability to finish) and we nearly cleaned every plate. I will definitely go back the next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I felt the light and love as soon as I walked into this place. The way I'd describe it is like getting a hug from your mama :) I miss it already. I had the \"Classic\" tofu omelette (spinach, red bell pepper, scallions and cheese). Comes with an apple and orange slice, along with a side of breakfast potatoes which included sweet potatoes. OH EM GEE don't let me forget that muffin it came with too. Goodness that was good it had a fruit filling I think it might have been raspberry. I will definitely be coming back maybe every single day :D not kidding. The woman at the cash register told me that they have yoga classes upstairs and if you join you get a discount at the cafe. I will be looking into that ASAP. 

P.S. I sat across from a fellow who was eating there for the first time as well but also his first time eating vegan food. He enjoyed everything as much as I did. Vegan or not, I truly encourage giving this sweet cafe a visit."}
{"text":"The food we ordered was terrible. We got the chile rellano and the tamale plate, which was disgusting. It was dry and flavorless. The rice and beans seemed like something out of a box. Was not worth $60. The best part of the place was the clean bathrooms and nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Really bummed out as the menu looked delicious and there was a lot I wanted to try. The location, service, and the food itself was fine, but the portions I received for the price were awful. The large smoothie was the size of a grande Starbucks cup (that I paid $10 for) and my lentil loaf sandwich was small and came with maybe 4 fries. I don't eat much as I'm very small and petite (105lbs), but it in no way filled me up and I left to buy food somewhere else. Expect to spend $20+ per person and leave still feeling hungry. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My daughter and I walked in on Saturday prior to our scheduled float next door.  We were never greeted.  The place was not well lit and the food in the display cases all looked old, rather dry and unappealing.  The older gentleman working never spoke a word.  It was a little unsettling.  We left.  I do love Go Raw by the Lakes and have visited there numerous times.  I did not know they were connected and would not have guessed it by our visit to this Cafe.  We will continue frequenting the Lakes location only.  No desire to return to the Rainbow location, sorry :(."}
{"text":"One of our go-to vegan spots, food never disappoints and service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"There is a girl there with \"VEGAN\" tattooed across the front of her neck, If that's not dedication I don't know what is."}
{"text":"the vegan pancakes are worth  coming back to vegas alone. the menu is so diverse as well as the fresh juice and smoothie drink menu."}
{"text":"I passed this place many times. So...I picked up a menu while I waited for my partner who had an appointment across the street.  Being Mexican, I looked straight at the enchiladas. So, I ordered it and another dish for guy. The dish was fabulous. Although the enchiladas weren't authentic, I didn't expect them to be considering that the café is vegan. However, the jack fruit in the enchiladas had a texture that mimics meat. The guacamole was cold (as it should be) and down right delicious and fresh. The beans, which were peppered with some corn, were tasty.  To top it off, the meal was gluten free.  I will definitely be back.  Oh yeah, my German, meat-eating partner loved his sandwich too."}
{"text":"PROS:
+ House Salad
+ Eggplant Parm. GF Sandwich
+ Fresh Juices
+ Yummy Dessert Truffle Bites 
+ HUGE Violife Section (my fav thing about this place)
+ I've always had great service 
+ They have a rewards program
+ They have an entire raw menu

CONS: 
- I live in Green Valley so it's not super close (I usually go to Vegenation on Eastern)
- I think the inside is a little dated and needs a remodel. Would love to see the set up and design be a little more inviting and alive."}
{"text":"Delicious food, pretty garden seating and great service. Cold pressed coffee was really good and the pesto burrito was amazing. Nice to get away from the strip where vegan options are hard to find anyway. I'll be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The courtyard is very charming and chill. The salad bar is cool and they weigh it by the pound, similar to grocery store salad bar prices. Very good customer service as well."}
{"text":"I ordered a pesto tofu omelette.. I was a little hesitant about the pesto being too overpowering.. long behold it was the most delicious breakfast I've ever had! It was accompanied with some potatoes.. when looking at it you think that's not enough I need more. Nope totally perfect amount of food. Also came with a blueberry muffin which was delicious. Kept me full for hours. Thank you go vegan cafe for you compassionate and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, salad. Pretty fresh.  A positive experience."}
{"text":"I went twice, and I have been disappointed the both time. 

The place is pretty gloomy, and the salad bar does not see fresh and clean. The staff was not welcoming at all. I am actually surprise to read so many good reviews about this place.  

First time, I had the Superfood Smoothie made of Bananas blended with Cacao Powder & Nibs, Maca, Hemp Protein, & Goji powder. It was just ok. 

Second time, I had a sandwish Gluten free grilled whole grain bread filled w/ roasted veggies & melted cheese blend, served with sweet potatoes. It was barely good. The sandwish was tiny like a portion for kids and the sweet potatoes were not good at all. I could not finish the sweet potato, even though I was starving. I mean how can you mess with sweet potatoes?! SERIOUSLY! 

Anyway, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"After becoming ill from one of their burritos, and finding out the Health Department had (finally) payed a visit..I was curious to see the public records on this place. My previous experiences haven't been that bad, but they certainly weren't great. Firstly...go to the bathroom somewhere else because the facilities here are gross. The service here is hit or miss, some of the employees are nice but the Management is horrendous. I've witnessed them verbally abuse their staff and even food delivery services drivers, like Uber and Grub Hub. I had ordered the classic burrito and eaten it and felt a bit off. Within the next few hours I definitely didn't feel good, and shortly after that I know it was food poisoning, or at least bad food. I haven't eaten there since. I also witnessed Management insist that an employee at the juice bar, pick up a sliced apple that fell on the dirty floor mat and use it in a juice. Luckily the juicer explained, that was against health code, but she got in trouble for doing the right thing. This verbal exchange happened in front of me and other customers. I would have called the Health Dept. right there if it went in the blender! I looked up the public records. See the photos I attached. You can see they have a good amount of demerits, even close to a C rating at times. Based on the records I can tell they are not going to change and have no real intention to run their food establishment safely for its customers. I find this dishonest practice and complete lack of respect for the publics health and well being despicable! These Two Managers have NO BUSINESS running a business. Aside from that, the actual menu items are a complete waste of your money. Most the specialty items are store bought, taken out of the package and then heated, or not, and put on your plate. And then your paying 12$ and up. Literally, freshly cut waffles fries..means frozen from the bag and stuck in the oven, and served at near room temp. There is a small stand alone freezer, over by the tea and coffee bar, and you can find your tamales in there. Frozen and off the shelf. What's really sad is that they found a way to muck up produce. The salad bar isn't sanitary, and from sitting at the juice bar, I could tell, First In First Out, was not a phrase Management has heard of or practices. You think your safe eating raw, but fruits and veggies go bad; but they don't care. And thats what makes this the even worse! they don't care about their customers who want to spend their money on a quality VEGAN experience! Being talked down to and disrespected by the two supposed owners, says it all. Save your money, go to ANY OTHER vegan spot in town. Oh, and based on the fact that they hold their employees checks for 3 weeks after they are due is a huge sign of them being in the pooper financially. And I think the nasty old man who is mean to al the customers, lives there!"}
{"text":"The food tastes great but portions on many things are a bit small. I liked the food both times i visited but the others with me were less than impressed. Its nice to have vegan food with gluten free options in the SW area of town but i havent been back in a while."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito classic style is so good! I hope more people will come to enjoy thier cooking! The staff is always friendly & very knowledgeable of what they serve! Highly recommend you make it here if you want great Plant based food!!! GO VEGAN!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service. Owner is super sweet, and every time I'm in Vegas we have to stop to dine here. I love love love their cold pressed coffee with their house made cashew milk. I wish you open up a place in California"}
{"text":"Ok yay! I'm a fan.

I used to LOVE Go Raw and was super sad when they closed down and especially because they were not too far from our house.

Well we have given this place a try a few times and we are happy to say we love it!!!!!!

Raw items are my fav but hubs likes the cooked items so it's really the best of both worlds!!!!

Four star!"}
{"text":"We went to Go Vegan Cafe for their Veganuary breakfast special and it was the best breakfast I've had since going vegan! Pancakes have a perfect texture and a good set of topping options. The real winner is the omelette though. The peso omelette is TO DIE FOR.

They use a mix of Daiya and Culinary Co. cheese and it melts phenomenally!"}
{"text":"Don't let the faux Roman decor fool you--this is about as core tie-dye vegan combined with modern vegan  nice place.
 Easy parking and right on Rainbow with good service and menu. Also has books and things to go.
Evolving in the right direction and food in quality and taste is great."}
{"text":"So happy this is down the street from me! Vegan AND gluten free food! I got the pesto scramble and it was delicious, my kids got the grilled cheese and my hubby ordered the lentil loaf sandwich. Everything was exceptional and very filling. As with most fresh vegan food, it took a little while to prepare but was worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"Best vegan breakfast I've ever had! This food has brought me so much joy. Gluten free and vegan deliciousness! Great staff and atmosphere. The juices are healthy and yummy freshness. Feeling pure love and gratitude."}
{"text":"Not a place I'd typically wander in from the street but went on a tip from a co-worker and I loved it! I had a pesto veggie quesadilla Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They offer the best Vegan burgers I've ever had!!! The menu is also 99% gluten free which is amazing for me because I have celiac disease. I don't have to worry about cross contamination. I love that they offer tons of raw foods as well. The raw desserts are delicious. The chocolate truffles are a must have!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have been here about 4 times or so. I have tried the Raw \"cheese\" burger, raw Italian burger, house burrito, and the veggie collard green wrap. the raw \"cheese\" burger was my favorite. I was so amazed by how much flavor all of these dishes had, it was so delicious. I am in no way vegan, but what I love most about this place is that the food was so great and I felt so good after that I started to incorporate raw vegan dishes in my diet more and it is awesome. this restaurant showed me how tasty vegetables can be prepared. If it wasn't for the price I would probably eat here several times a week. I love the raw vegan section of the menu and I am hoping to try it all eventually."}
{"text":"I hate giving a review that is less than 4 stars. I want to love everything and make everyone happy, but alas... 
I came here on my lunch break today and was sat promptly and guided to a nice seat on the heated, enclosed patio. I ordered quickly (pesto tofu scramble burrito) as I had already decided what I wanted before I arrived. On a one hour lunch break, one must be efficient. I figured the food would be out quickly as the place wasn't very busy and what I ordered seemed pretty simple....25 minutes later when my food arrived I was contemplating throwing it in a to-go container so I could make it back to the office on time. 
The overall taste was very good but some of the potatoes were a bit undercooked for my taste. Although considering half of their menu is raw maybe this is their cooking style? The random orange and apple slice on the plate is also quite odd.
I had signed up a few weeks ago, on Facebook messenger, for a free truffle. But then they wouldn't allow me to use it without inputting my phone number and signing up for their dining membership. I did as I was told but felt a bit swindled in the moment, especially since I'm not sure I will be back. It might be in poor taste complaining about a free item but I was thinking the coupon was to simply get me in the door, not to force me to sign up. 
Next time, if I'm craving a vegan lunch, I'll just order for delivery."}
{"text":"I came to eat here about a week ago, and I came because I saw their Veganuary promotion. I ordered the breakfast, that comes with a side of pancakes, and a tofu scramble with vegan sausage and hash browns. I enjoyed the pancakes, but didn't like the rest of the food. I just didn't enjoy the taste, and so I asked if I could switch out my dish for something different. The server prompted the manager to come over, and I expressed to her the same thing. She said I could get something different, but would have to pay for it along with my dish at a 10% discount. Also, she didn't understand why I didn't like the food, and to me it felt like I had offended her by not liking the food. Which everyone has different taste preferences and that's okay. She seemed a bit upset, and it didn't seem right to me that I couldn't get something different and that the discount was so little since I didn't want to eat the food. Earlier before speaking to her about the food, she was very polite, but after it felt to me she was being rude. Personally I won't be returning to eat here since there are many other vegan restaurants I can go to. The lack of communication and customer service towards the end wasn't okay with me. Ultimately I explained all my concerns to the server, didn't eat my food any further which I did not want to eat, and when I went to pay she gave me 20% discount instead.
I haven't tried any other food here, and won't be. I felt the experience was just very uncomfortable, too much miscommunication and didn't enjoy the customer service on the end."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I am vegan myself however I came here with my dad who isn't vegan and he thought it was great! The menu has so many different options from burgers all the way to quesadillas, there's something for everyone. I ordered the raw veggie wrap and he got the eggplant sandwich. I also grabbed a few truffles from their dessert bar (it was so hard to choose from all of the options haha) Such a cute atmosphere and all of the employees were really nice and helpful :)"}
{"text":"From the moment we stepped into the cafe, we were surrounded by smiling faces and friendly company! The workers clearly loved their jobs and wanted to make our experience a positive one. They had awesome suggestions and easily served me the best raw vegan burrito ever 
My only complaint is towards myself for waiting a year to drive down the street to come visit this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and kind waitresses. I got the classic burger and added Guam and needless to say...simply amazing, love this place!"}
{"text":"You really never know what to expect with vegan/vegetarian restaurants so I came with an open mind.
We sat in the quiet garden/patio area which was great. The restaurants dining room itself was far from exciting so it was cool they had an alternative place to dine. Plants, a fountain, and high vaulted ceilings made for a quaint place to have brunch! 
Now to the menu...
To drink: I got the green zing and although it was tasty, it was centrifugally juiced versus cold pressed and this bummed me out a bit. It's not a BIG deal but it's worth mentioning.
Boyfriend got the pina cool-ada and liked it a lot. However, those two drinks alone cost me nearly $20 so I don't think I'll be getting any drinks next time. 
To eat: I got the pesto breakfast burrito and it was very very good. The \"eggs\" has great flavor and the pesto was spot on. Just wish for $11 and change this burrito had more bang for the buck. 
Boyfriend got the BBQ pulled jack sandwich and was very impressed. He eats meat and tries these places with skepticism but he thoroughly smashed this sandwich. The waffle fries though... They were so stingy. I guess they're weighed out but it was very disappointing.

Overall: 
Food= excellent
Drinks= good 
Portions= lacking
Service= excellent
Ambiance= outside:good as inside:lacking
Price=good"}
{"text":"It was my boyfriend and my first time here today. Went in around 10 and immediately got seated, water was brought to us, and server was super friendly and helpful! There were two employees out front, I'm assuming it was who manages the restaurant (a lady) and a server. Both of them were super friendly and welcoming! Ordered the Eggplant Parmesan and boyfriend got the Mexi Burger and some pancakes with mango, pineapple and coconut topping. Everything was so good, my Parmesan eggplant was DELICIOUS!!! I will definitely be back more often to try the rest of the menu! I love how much variety in food they have. Overall, it was a great experience and definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Love the waffles. Love the atmosphere. Everything is fresh and well made, gluten-free, vegan. Juices and smoothies are fantastic. A real pick me up."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious. The loaded nachos was amazing. Minor point I would have added a much meat to it. Spouse had the jack fruit enchiladas and the flavor was phenomenal and the beans and rice were perfection. His minor point is having a slightly larger serving considering he his a skinny thing. He also added a juice to his meal that he really enjoyed. Service is terrific.  Now to check out the dessert bar.  We will be back here again to dine."}
{"text":"So sad to give this place 2 stars. 

I will cut to the chase..We ordered a Mediterranean burger and had a couple spoons of mixed fruit from the salad bar. The Mediterranean burger patty was pretty flavorless and the texture was less than ideal. It was a mushy patty that fell apart at each bite. It had \"tabouleh\" and hummus on it as well. I saw both on the burger, but tasted neither. The burger was $16 and came with just a few cross cut fries. 

The fruit looked old and as though it had been sitting there for a few days. Side note, the salad bar is self service and is $9/pound..which in my opinion is pretty over priced. 

Overall, 1 star for food, 1 star for service. This place is pretty pricey for the tiny portions and less than mediocre food."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best vegan restaurants I've been to. Their salad bar is utterly delicious. If you are looking to be healthy, and want delicious food- fast- this is the answer.  If you are looking for uniquely spiced food, this is also the answer. 

That being said, this place is not as easy for first time vegan attempts. Their stuff is very healthy - they don't add salt or fat in regular restaurant methods. You'd better ask for help in choosing the plainer, more rich dishes."}
{"text":"This place is heaven for vegans and plant base eater!!!  And for those transition to became a full-timer plant eater check this place out.  Or even if you are not vegan check this place out.  Go Vegan Café environment is such a nice cafe to eat, work, socialize,  and just feeling presently satisfied.  All the workers are kind and love what they do!!!  There is nothing that beets a satisfying cafe.  I'll definitely be back for the food and man I love the fountain they have there.   This place is Zen As Fuck!!!"}
{"text":"As vegans, travel can be unpredictable at best. Vegas has been a most pleasant surprise! Go Vegan Cafe has such a delightful blend of ambience and exceptional food! The service has been spot on. Our server was attentive and personable. The food was SO good! Tried the Tropical smoothie on our servers recommendation and loved it. Breakfast burrito and raw green burrito are so worth the trip! Thanks again Go Vegan Cafe, we will surly be back!"}
{"text":"Go Vegan has been open for a while now and it's super close to our home and this was my first visit. 
I came in around 4:30 after the VegFest on 4/9. The place was pretty empty but that didn't matter to me. I had looked online at the menu and decided on the Asian burger with waffle fries. I got my food to go since I only live 5 minutes away by car. 
When I opened the to go box the food looked really good. The only negative upon first look was there were very few fries. The few fries in the box were crisp and delicious. The burger was SO GOOD...but the only negative I will give it was that the bun COMPLETELY fell apart on both the bottom and top from being just slightly wet from the condiments. Literally impossible to eat this burger with my hands, I had to grab a fork and knife to try and eat the rest."}
{"text":"As a vegan I must commend what they have done here. What they have done is taken familiar foods that we all know and love, made them vegan without losing any of its qualities of the familiar food. They have enhanced the flavors of the food that you are enjoying by keeping two important attributes, quality and love! The quality of this food can be put next to any 4 star restaurant on the strip! The love is comparable to what your mom puts into her cooking. 
I had the breakfast feast which came with your choice scramble, potatoes, pancakes and a choice of sausage or bacon. We also had the fiery dragon sushi and avocado fries (which aren't really fried). All were so delicious and perfectly proportioned. The fiery dragon is a must if you are curious about vegan sushi and quality and the breakfast feast is worth it if you want to get an idea of how much love is put into your food! I was very happy with my experience, the staff really were knowledgeable and came around frequently to check on you. Thanks again for the awesome service. The food was so good I forgot to take pictures!
Eat like me."}
{"text":"Amazing delicious food!Took my hun here after hearing from friends how good it was. 
For an appetizer  a e had the gulten free pancakes with mango and spicy nuts and seeds. Not fluffy pancakes, but none the less delicious and my favorite part swimming in syrup! 
 I had the Mexi Vegan Burger (not the raw one this time) and I thought it was beyond great! Great flavor and the sides of katsup, guac, and salsa were not needed to dress the burger up, but complemented it well.
She had the lentil loaf and it too was impressive.
Very filling and no left overs!"}
{"text":"It's really convenient vegan cafe , especially like the salad bar ! All the vegetables are always fresh and organic! 
Best babaganush I've ever had ! 
So happy finding my almost everyday meal place !!"}
{"text":"In the unlikely event that the reader has read any of my previous reviews, especially those who commit to a smaller population, a.k.a. vegans, vegetarians, etc... you would notice that I give a lot of credit to that level of passion and commitment. 
Same goes for Go Vegan Cafe, I found this place after a search on Yelp, specifically looking for a Vegan option while in LAS on business. It was quite exciting when this popped up in the search and  I drove 5 miles with great enthusiasm to enjoy a nice healthy lunch option.
The place did not disappoint. Warm, prompt service and many options to select from. I enjoyed a salad and washed it down with a healthy juice.
The only reason they fall short of the 5 stars, is because most of the menu is based on vegan substitutions of the usual suspects, Pizza, Burgers, Sandwiches, Burritos, Tostadas. IMHO, there is no need to try to replicate those items, you already got us, we are Vegan, we don't walk through the door because we want to have a burger, I think we have already transitioned to the bright side, and quite frankly, you will not turn a non vegan into began just because you serve them the Vegan alternative to their flesh eating ways. 
But then again... this is just my opinion, and I could be wrong."}
{"text":"I have tried to like this place because it is healthy. The biggest problem I have is the portion sizes for the price. I have read many reviews that mention the small portions and management just doesn't seem to care. The side of fries that comes with the menu items are ridiculously small. Like 8 fries. I buy organic sweet potatoes - they are not THAT expensive. Most of the menu items are just not enough food. You shouldn't leave a restaurant hungry. Why don't they care enough about their customers to even address their complaints? I don't usually bother reviewing restaurants at all but this just irks me."}
{"text":"We like dipping out toes into Vegan food every now and again, so decided to check this place out. We got a whole bunch of stuff to share, and most of it was good, if a little pricey. Highlight was the mexican bean burger which was so good, we got another one to go to have for dinner that evening!."}
{"text":"Trust me when I say this is going to be one of the best vegan restaurants you've ever been to. Actually, don't take my word for it- go and try this for yourself.

I met up with my sister for a weekend in Vegas. We decided to have brunch before her flight and we truly left the best for last with Go Vegan Cafe. This location is a bit off the beaten path, but there's only so much of the Strip I can take in one sitting. 

We arrived minutes after they opened and had the covered patio all to ourselves. (I believe I spotted air conditioning units, which is necessary in Vegas heat) Our server was warm and friendly and answered our questions? about the extensive menu and provided great suggestions for our newbie experience. We finalized our choices to: the omelet and raw collard greens wrap. We also added the breakfast sausage because the server told us it was house made. 

I've had a couple vegan omelets in the Boston area and, while they were both amazing, they resembled more of a crispy crepe than? an omelet. That was not the case here. With a fluffy, souffle-like texture, it was the closest thing to the real deal I've ever had. The oat-based sausages were equally amazing. (Double check with your server if you're gluten free) As a bonus, a little muffin came as an accompaniment to our omelet. So much bang for your buck with this dish! To my absolute delight, it ended up being a seasonal strawberry rhubarb and it was perfectly baked. It was a \"This is vegan!?\" moment, for sure. The collard wrap was refreshing to eat as we felt the desert air start to warm up. The crisp wrap and creamy filling was a satisfying combination.

After our meal, we walked over to the register by the front door and saw the workers stocking the salad bar, in case you are in need of a quick meal. Another FYI, they give you stevia with coffee. I'm? particular about coffee and think stevia leaves a bit of a metallic taste, but it didn't affect me since I carry around a travel size maple syrup in my purse. The coffee itself is cold-brewed, which means it's less acidic and easier on your tummy. Ever notice when milk looks curdled when you pour it into your coffee? That's a reaction to an acidic brew."}
{"text":"The food was alright. The service was kind, but unattentive, forgetful and uncommunicative. I ordered coffee, but didn't receive it until the end of my meal and it was not worth the wait. I've been to many vegan restaurants in Vegas, so I was excited to try this place out, but sadly it was a huge disappointment. I would not come back here again."}
{"text":"We arrived a little over an hour and a half before a scheduled float next door and intended on getting a light meal in before our float.  When we arrived the restaurant was empty.  It was 110+ degrees outside so it was a little warm, but not terrible inside the cafe.  They had all the lights off and ceiling fans running, it reminded me a little of eating at places outside the US where they don't rely on 24-7 AC.  

We sat down and looked over the menus for a few minutes, we ordered a green juice, raw pizza, and jackfruit tacos.  The juice arrived shortly, maybe 10 min?  The man who took our order was the one who made the juice.  A middle aged woman was also slowly pacing behind a counter watching  us, but aside from that they appeared to be the only staff in the front of the house. They were both kind of joyless and not at all welcoming.

 Another table of two arrived after my friend got her juice.  We were chatting and I noticed this table received their food order before ours even though they arrived about 20 minutes after we did.  We continue to chat and anticipate our food.  I checked the clock and noticed we had been waiting over 45 min for our food and only had about 15 min before our scheduled float.  I got up and inquired, and apparently the man forgot to put in our order.  I asked to just cancel the order and pay for the juice as we had to go.  He offered to have the food prepared for us after our float, and I declined as the point was to eat BEFORE the float.  He didn't seem to want to do that and said \"well they already started the food, it should only be about 5 more min\", well by then it would be time for us to be next door.  I insisted that we just get it to go then, and he still brought it out on plates.  I asked for the check and some boxes.  Pretty unpleasant.  The food was okay.  I enjoyed raw pizza that had hummus on it, but otherwise it wasn't anything special and certainly not worth waiting over an hour for.  (it's hummus spread on dehydrated nut crust and sprinkled with chopped tomato and arugula, it should have taken maybe 2 minutes to assemble at the most.  My friends jackfruit taco and rice and beans tasted microwaved and all elements were prepared ahead of time and simply assembled so there is no reason for the hour wait except the man forgot).  No apology or acknowledgement of inconvenience.  The raw pizza was about the size of 2 wasa crackers and cost $16.  Our total bill was about $45 with tax.  

Not recommended."}
{"text":"We don't live in Las Vegas, so we didn't know what to expect. We had breakfast burritos, tofu scrambles, waffles, coffee, and juice. All of it was beautifully done! Clean, tasty, healthy, and perfect sized portions. The ambiance is also nice as was the staff. We loved it!"}
{"text":"Had the breakfast burrito spinach style. It was more like a breakfast taco than a burrito, but it was very good. Very flavorful. The space itself was a little weird, really large with an awkward layout, but at least the food was good :). Glad to see more vegan places opening up."}
{"text":"Even if the raw vegan lifestyle isn't for you, the food here is fresh, fun, great tasting, and good for you! Plus it's the best kind of takeout ever, since you don't have to worry about it getting cold. ;)

There are \"raw\" and just vegan items available- the raw burgers (portabello on nut patty!) and collard wraps (mexican and italian-style!) are my favorites though, both served with avocado \"fries\". If you want a liquid lunch, they have a massive selection of smoothies and shakes, as well as fresh young coconuts.

Location is a bit odd: you cash out at the hostess stand rather than the back bakery counter or the large ground counter where the staff sit. There's a huge salad bar ($9/lb) in the middle of the dining room with a small supplement shop area to the right, and the \"small talk garden\" area to the back. There's just a lot going on and not much in the way of decor. I guess all their focus and energy are busy in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"These guys have a wide variety of comfort food and raw foods. My wife got the daily special a heaping plate of nachos which were completely vegan. They tasted better than real nachos. I got the acai granola smootie bowl. It was very tasty. Worthy of a five stars pending on going back and trying other things."}
{"text":"I met my friend here for lunch and it was absolutely perfect. I was pleasantly surprised at how big the menu was and appreciated the fresh salad bar. If you're alone- grab a vegan treat, maybe some of their homemade truffles, browse their little book store, and relax next to the beautiful calming fountain. I ended up having the kale salad and was very pleased with the flavor and portion size. Next time I think I'll try some of the banana pancakes!

During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting the owner who checked on our table to make sure we had a good experience- always a plus!"}
{"text":"We ate at the cafe last night And had the cheese fries and pesto pizza which we added sausage to. It was very delicious and flavorful. We are from Arizona and wanted were looking for a vegan restaurant in vegas. We just ordered from there again for lunch and it was so yummy!!! We got the tamales and the breakfast burrito with sausage and jalapeños. Again, everything was outstanding!!! I would highly recommend this cafe and will definitely come back next time I'm in vegas :)"}
{"text":"I ate there twice passing through Vegas, it was so worth it. They have a pretty wide variety of menu options from sandwiches, pizza, wraps, salads, etc., I most most impressed with the pancakes with bananas, pecans, and walnuts. They also have a cool little courtyard adjoining the main dining area where they have tables too. It's clear they care about the quality of food and the prices weren't bad at all. 

They also have a huge and very creative offering of juices and smoothies on a separate menu."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service and let's not forget the delicious food. Loved every bite of my burger that I didn't have time to take a picture."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is great, the food is healthy and delicious, prices are very reasonable and service is great. I will definitely come back here in any chance I get. Great place not only for vegans."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place after a workout at the nearby track. Did a quick Yelp search of the photos and it appeared the mixed berry pancakes were the route to go so that's what's I went with.

I really enjoyed them. If you have any problem with soggy, that could be an issue because they send the cakes out in a plate with a puddle of a light syrup in the bottom. It didn't really bother me though honestly. 

The Vegan thing isn't really for me as I eat a lot of protein. When they say vegan they mean vegan. Theres no hidden beef burger on the menu unfortunately. 

We sat in the greenhouse-like area outside of the main dining room. It was really nice ambiance with a cool fountain. Unique seating area. 

The problem with that was that we literally waited 15 minutes for service and the place wasn't very busy at all. After about 5 minutes we went inside to use the restroom and told the waiter we were outside and it still took 10 minutes or so for him to come out and grab our orders. 

So they lose a star for the subpar service but the food was tasty."}
{"text":"I have been to several vegetarians cafés and this one is my least favorite. The server was a very miserable looking old man that barely made any eye contact and didn't really suggest anything when asked. He said,\"just look at the menu.\" I ordered the classic burger with fries. The burger itself, I think was so undercooked.  I didn't know if it was supposed to be mushy or just whatever. The atmosphere was very sad and there wasn't that many choices to drink besides this newbies. I was never updated on what I needed or if I was OK, the food came out fast but like I said, I don't think that it was cooked all the way.I definitely will not be coming back to this place. On a side note none of the tables were clean and it appears that a lot of the menus were just laid out strewn about."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for the pool party scene and needed fuel after a long day in the sun.  Found Go Vegan Cafe online and so stoked we did.  Everything on the menu is plant based, if you're not a vegan or vegetarian don't be turned off by that fact.  I guarantee regardless of your diet you'll find something great to eat.

John was our server and he was very courteous and chill.  I had the breakfast burrito and it was amazing.  Fresh veggies, tasty sausage and fresh guac.  Awesome!

Check this place out. Reasonably priced and tons of options."}
{"text":"My vegan friend met me here for lunch today. Upon entering, I loved the calm vibe that surrounded us! Two seating locations (inside and covered \"outdoor\" area w a water fall thing). Our server was extremely nice and relaxed and willing to answer all of our questions. We perused the salad bar which looked AMAZING! It was serve yourself by the lb for $9!!! I DEEPLY regret not opting for this. It had salad fixings, hummus, potato salads and veggie galore! All so fresh. 

I decided on the traditional burger w sweet potato fries and a choco-cinn smoothie. My friend ordered the loaded nachos and another item I can't recall, but is pictured (tostadas?). 

Our food arrived fairly quickly and it looked really good! I am by no means a vegetarian or vegan, but I do love veggie burgers. This was not disappointing! It was full of black bean flavor, corn and spices. My only regret is not reading the description more closely because it had a lot of mustard on it!  But still delicious. The smoothie was great as well. Very banana-y tasting which my friend said most of their smoothies taste like. 

Check out is done up front. I had a bit of sticker shock as this place is not cheap by any means, unless you get a special or the salad bar. My burger and fries were $14 and regular smoothie was $7. I definitely want to return though to try some of their other items!!"}
{"text":"This is a little gem. I didn't even know it was close to my house. We went for breakfast and had the scrambled Mexicali. It was delicious and just the right amount of food to feel full."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! Healthy food and they have an awesome indoor patio with a fountain."}
{"text":"I have a friend that eats gluten free and vegetarian for health reasons  He's a good sport and will find something to eat anywhere, but I enjoy finding places that cater to his needs.  This was a great find.  

I had the Grilled Cheese sandwich and minestrone soup. It was excellent.  This was a gluten free and vegan sandwich and I enjoyed every bit of it.  The cheese tasted good and melted perfectly. Dave had the burger which he raved about.  He wanted to take home a pack of the buns just to eat. 

I have to say the service was excellent and friendly.  As I said, I ordered the minestrone soup and the broth was excellent.  I should tell you that I am a picky eater.  Among other things, I just don't do onions.  This soup was packed with onions and consequently, I left most of it uneaten.  I really felt bad when he didn't charge me for the soup.  But he was gracious about the situation. 

The atmosphere was a little bohemian and perfect for the meal.  It's clean and funky and a fun place to eat.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying other things.  The salad bar looks fantastic."}
{"text":"his was so amazing I have the Mediterranean platter the service was excellent the food was excellent I will be back again as much as I can but this is a great place to eat raw food or vegan food"}
{"text":"Very solid vegan joint. A lot of people in the other reviews seem to complain about the price but I don't think there is an issue. People don't seem to understand that they make EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH (which is not a quick or easy task). I feel that the prices are justifiable. They have a wide variety of items on the menu. The salad bar is great too. Service is always friendly and the staff have always been helpful. Easily my favorite vegan joint in town."}
{"text":"Good vibes from the second we walked in, great salad bar with alot of fresh choices, the cold brewed coffee is amazing and the food was even better!!! Thank goodness this place is close to home!"}
{"text":"Go vegan is my go to spot whenever I'm in need of a healthy, comforting, tasty vegan meal on the go! Or I literally crave the pesto tofu scramble! Locally owned my favorite vegan spot in town!"}
{"text":"Consistently awesome! If you are Vegan or Plant Based, this should be part of your staple when dining out!! 

Sorry correction!  Everyone should be eating this way!
Thanks guys for the great service and for your contributions to how we should all be eating!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on impulse ! Great atmosphere, server was so patient and knowledgeable and the food was delicious......."}
{"text":"I came here in November with my son, we're from California. I'm vegan and I have a lot of allergies (gluten, soy, sugar etc.) and struggle to find food at restaurants I can actually eat. Go Vegan Cafe offers a plethora of delicious options I was able to have, including dessert. I will be taking the 10 hour round trip drive just to come back here. If there's one vegan  restaurant to try, it's this one, so worth it!"}
{"text":"Ordered a house special but it was not good at all. Told the waiter who did nothing about it or even offer something different. If you don't make the effort to ensure customers are enjoying their food why are you a server? We were still charged for the dish because the owner told the server that that was their policy. Absolutely terrible customer service don't come here."}
{"text":"Best vegan meal that I've had since I've been vegan for 1 month and 1/2. The potatoes complimented the tofu scramble and the amount of \"cheese\" they put in the scramble made it all the better. Oh and that was the tropical smoothie mixed with greens that I couldn't even stop drinking to wait till my food came"}
{"text":"A very humbling moment happened today while having an early dinner at #GoVeganCafe... As I was going up to pay, (the very sweet) Lou told me I'm all set. It didn't register, so I was like huh? Lol, she said \"it's on us... Rod (the owner) has been trying to come visit your new business, but the only day he's around is on Mondays... & you're closed Monday's...\" That's love & respect right there. Comes to show there's still good people out there. We're still truly humbled  thank you again, @goraw.govegan! (Oh, this is the mexi pizza w jackfruit btw)"}
{"text":"It's Sunday morning and it's feeding time! I asked Hunnie Bunnie if she wanted to go out to eat this morning and she asked if we could come here! My good little Vegan! Of course I said Yes, I've Been wanting to try this place out as well. 

They have indoor and \"outdoor\" seating and they sell vegan products within as well.

We were seated at a booth and ordered:

Mexi Burger: Veggie patty w/roasted pasilla peppers, melted Daiya cheese, and slaw. (Also added the roasted jalapenos!) Side of Pico de gallo and guacamole. Side of spicy sweet potato fries, included. 

Classic grilled cheese sandwich w/potato salad, included: blend of Daiya cheeses. 

Hunnie Bunnie loved her potato salad and the grilled cheese was nice and cheesey for her! Thumbs up for sure! 

My burger was delicious as well! I cut it in half and tried to eat it with my hands but ended up eating with a fork and knife. It was a bit messy but tastey so who cares! And the roasted jalapeños added a nice kick to it. 

We both agree that fake \"meat\" isn't really the business and they have great options here that don't include soy \"chicken\" and whatever else... Lots of fresh ingredients. All raw options and cooked items on the menu.
We will definitely come here again! NOM NOM!"}
{"text":"Way to go-go vegan! You guys made a great attitude change to match your tasty menu. I love the scrambles here but rarely ate in due to the kinda unpleasant atmosphere. Today soft music, smiles, pleasant staff and still great food!"}
{"text":"Over the last couple weeks I have been exploring my vegan side and trying several restaurants that provide vegan options. The food here was excellent and creative. I picked the pulled BBQ jackfruit sandwich as I have had this sandwich before at a different restaurant. The spices added to this sandwich were very unique and bursting with flavor!! 

The restaurant itself has a very odd setup and a bit confusing if you walk in from the side/back? entrance. The restaurant has a smoothie bar, (with a very unfriendly man working it), a little health section \"grocery store\", and a salad bar that feels very out of place. 

Our server was extremely nice and you can't beat the price of healthy food. Good food that won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"Good,  clean food.  I frequent this place and like it a lot.  It's not a traditional restaurant experience,  but that's not what I go here for.  The food is delicious and surprisingly filling for the portions.  I usually call ahead for pickup and never wait long when I arrive.  Rod and Lou remember me and always make me feel appreciated as a customer.  House salad,  lentil sandwich,  and veggie cotti are my favorites.  Give it a try,  expand your horizons."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Many choices. It's the first restaurant I checked out that also serves raw vegan food. Try the try the loaded fries that they have.  I had a raw Burger sandwich."}
{"text":"I really, really love this place 

GMO-free power food. Their salad bar is AMAZING!! I've also had the spicy beet burger. OMG- yum! :)) 

Thank you Go Vegan!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! There is a build your own salad bar for $9.00/lb, market items and desserts and a full vegan + raw food + juice + smoothie menu. They cover all the bases. I got the lentil loaf and love juice. Then couldn't pass up a chocolate truffle for dessert...it was the perfect size to hit your sweet spot. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Their apple cinnamon pancakes are delish! This is my first time in Vegas. And we're new vegans! So I was excited to find this place online. I arrived before opening, and they let me in about five minutes early. I loved my pancakes so much that I ordered lunch to go. My server was an angel! I wish I could take this place home!"}
{"text":"I am a vegan and I want to love this place, but they make it impossible. It's definitely worth checking out, but to me the food is underwhelming and over priced."}
{"text":"This place is super fun!  Vegan and Raw options and such a great atmosphere I got some of there raw desserts delicious and the jackfruit Mexican pizza. Great ambiance and great for groups and a trustworthy vegan spot"}
{"text":"Good not great. I am not vegan but appreciate vegan cuisine The family and I came her for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The staff was very friendly And attentive. I loved the huge gluten free menu. The kids had the cinnamon apple waffle. I tried it and it was great sweet and candied with fresh fruit on top. I had the raw portobello mushroom sandwich. I was disappointed in it because it was way over salted. It had a good flavor with the pesto sauce on the heavy grain bread if I could get past the salt on the portobello marinate it would have been good. My son had a vegan burger the consistency of the meat substitute was really nice and felt like real burger meat the only negative is that it was salty as well.   They had a lot of interesting items on the menu like tamales and fresh pressed coffee plus lots of juices."}
{"text":"Solid vegan food- high quality ingredients. I tried the raw portobello wrap and raw spicy burger. The burger had great flavor and came with avocado 'fries'. They also have a small shop in the back to buy raw snacks and supplements. Not everything is made in house- like the desserts and rawtillas. They also have a small buffet if you want to grab a salad to go, but the a la carte items looked better."}
{"text":"Such great vegan comfort food! We ordered the loaded nachos and the breakfast special.  It was a lot of food!  Very satisfying and full of flavor.  The service was excellent, the place is very clean, and there was a good amount of people here eating.  They have lots of vegan desserts and breads here to buy as well as healthy living books and supplements.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to pick up an early first dinner and were so delighted with both the food and the service!  The house salad is not ordinary but has a bunch of different chopped veggies, sprouts, and a proprietary dressing that so perfectly merged and complimented the flavors we ate every bit of it!  Also had the BBQ Portobello sandwich with slaw and found it equally delicious. Our daughter had the Classic Cheese Pizza which again was not ordinary but had flavor augmenting spices that made me wish I'd ordered it for myself! Our other daughter had the Pesto Quesadilla and so loved it that I didn't manage to get a bite.  Loved the open airy dinning room with the big fountain.  I'd give this a 10 if I could. Viva Las Vegans!"}
{"text":"Adorable menu- great staff - can't wait to go back
We had the raw pizza and it was great.
What was a quick stop in has turned into a location we make a point of going to."}
{"text":"The elderly gentleman that doesn't speak much that a low star reviewer mentioned is still here, but he was pleasant. I'm not sure about the other complaints some people had since I didn't have the same issues on my visit, but otherwise, this place is worthy if you have diet restrictions or can't bear to eat food made from animals. 
We had the grilled cheese with tomatoes and the pesto pizza and a slice of carrot cake. They were smaller than average portions but overall sufficient for two people. The price is a little higher than traditional restaurants but that's expected for  non-animal and gluten free raw materials. The flavor for these meals was tasty and not bland and satisfying. The menu looks extensive so we will be back to try something else soon."}
{"text":"I did not think the buffet items were that fresh and tasty.  The indoor garden patio was pretty and great for a group.  There was an event that night, and the place seemed unprepared for orders, and service was very slow.  I might try their menu at another time, but having eaten at better vegan restaurants in town, I'm not in a hurry."}
{"text":"I know you don't know me, but you have to trust me on this one, if you're in Vegas you HAVE to come here (especially if you're vegan, but even if you're not you'll still love it). 

So we came here after a night of drinking looking for a baller breakfast and yeah, we found it. I got the mexicali tofu scramble with roasted jalapenos and the nachos. 

OH MY GOD.

These two things were AMAZING! The nachos tasted just like regular nachos, it's hard to believe they weren't loaded with actual cheese and meat. And as for the tofu scramble, one of the things I miss most after going vegan are eggs, but this tofu scramble proves that the chef here does tofu better than chickens do eggs. 

5 stars, easily. Go try this place!!"}
{"text":"They never disappoint. With a wide variety of choices and excellent service, I always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Delicious food, peaceful atmosphere, and wonderful service. We were served by A beautiful woman named Lou, lovely conversation. Left there enlightened and sated. Thank you so much Lou!!"}
{"text":"Awesome tasting Vegan food in a nice outdoor tranquil setting. The Vegan Mexican burger is a must try and all the organic juices are made fresh. Nice attentive staff that offer plenty of suggestions if you're not sure what to order.  This place will soon become a hit within the #Vegan community."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted a good vegan burger and fries and we saw some reviews that were pretty convincing so we tried Go Vegan Cafe. It's was delicious! I absolutely love that most of the menu is gluten-free.
I had the waffle cheese fries which were super crunchy and came with pico de gallo and guacamole on the side what more could I ask for? \"Is butter a carb? Whatever I'm getting cheese fries.\"
My boyfriend ordered the classic burger and the gluten free bun was amazing. I loved that the burger patty was visibly made of black beans but had a very subtle and inviting flavor unlike other over-seasoned ones I've had. 
Before we left we grabbed some gluten-free chocolate chip cookies, which were pretty pricey $6.48 for 4 small cookies, but delicious nonetheless. I'll definitely try it again."}
{"text":"My first time here at Go Vegan Cafe and the food was great. Enjoyed the atmosphere of the patio. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"My review is a little overdue (months) but I'm sure you'll read the more recent visitors' reviews. 

This is our first vegan restaurant to have a salad bar. It has a small corner dedicated to vegan snacks and vitamins like a mini grocery store. On a raised platform, there's a small display of desserts ranging from cookies to cakes.

The menu sounds appetizing. Their fresh juice drinks are absolutely fabulous. The burger did not have a hamburger/ciabatta bun (as pictured on menu) but a flat, hard, whole wheat English muffin-type bun. Extra crispy waffle fries were edible.

The female employee was nice. The older male employee checked up on our food and didn't smile. 

Large floor plan but it needs to be redesigned for a better flow...maybe someone should also redesign the menu. I felt the menu was catered more towards raw vegan than vegan. I'll come back to grab their refreshing drinks."}
{"text":"Someone kiss the chef for me! 

Well, the first vegan, gluten free, not raw dish that I have had here was 'The Loaf\" I got it with both sides and I am glad I did! 

The potatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly. I want to make them like that in my home!
The veggies were cooked and seasoned perfectly~ I love the variety and freshness. 
The Loaf very yum, and love the bbq sauce Major nom! 

I also had the Celery Soup of the day; it was light and perfect for after a colonic. I picked it up and couldn't put it back down. My body said \"Yes please, more please, thank you\" 

Love the Carrot cake- Dense and sweet, I can only eat a few bites at a time, but beautifully delicious! 

Easy Parking, Nice clean Restrooms and Plenty of seating."}
{"text":"One of my favorite vegan restaurants in Vegas. Love the salads, pulled pork sandwich, taco plate, and their Mediterranean platter. The dishes packs flavor, satisfying, and delicious. The staff are personable, knowledgable, and friendly. My husband and I keep coming back to this place because they serve quality foods that's not processed."}
{"text":"I recently started my 75% vegan diet, I say 75% because I still love sushi and hamburgers. I have driven by here many times but was turned off by the weird looking exterior, to me it resembles a office building or something else. But once inside I was impressed it has the vegan restaurant feel that I like with a cozy feel. It features daily pop up specials, a good sized salad bar and a veggie burger that could change my mind about eating hamburgers. I have only been here once but can't wait for my next visit. They post the daily specials on their FB page if you are interested."}
{"text":"I am not a Vegan by any stretch of the imagination, so my knowledge of this foodie world is lacking, with that being said, I found the food here to be very flavorful and filling. 

Walking-in it's very plain on the inside, looking like a half finished school cafeteria with a small grocery section selling vegan or vegetarian products. I sat down and realized I was the only person in here, which can be creepy. The menu is overwhelming, as there's a lot to choose from, to make matters worse, I wasn't really given any guidance on how to tackle it, so I went with the Lentil Loaf sandwich and the Roasted Veggie quesadilla. 

The Lentil Loaf was good, but a little on the dry side. It needed some type of sauce to moisten it up. The menu said it comes with BBQ sauce, but there was little to no sauce on this sammie. This was very filling and if you're looking for heavy meal, this is a good option. 

The Roasted Veggie Quesadilla had a lot more flavor, but it was greasy! Like needing to wash my hands after every bite, greasy. There was cheese on this, dairy free cheese, and to be honest, the difference wasn't ultra noticeable and I actually liked it. The roasted veggies still had a snap to them and a little heat that slowly escalated with every bite. Good stuff!

The design and the service here needs a huge upgrade, I only received one glass of water, which I had to ask for and was checked on only twice during the entire meal. Go Vegan needs to work on these things if they want to prosper in their not so great location."}
{"text":"I order the GF tacos which were super delicious. 
Tacos came with a side of guacamole, pico de gallo and rice & beans.
I loved the tacos with the  jackfruit \"meat\" which was very very tasty! 
Guacamole could have some more flavor to it as it was a little bland for me.
Rice and bean were good but there was lots of cumin which I am not really a fan of."}
{"text":"Go Vegan! This is a hippy paradise in a good way! They have lots of raw vegan menu items as well as a salad bar and juices. The also have a small area to the side for items for sale. I haven't looked too closely but I believe they have Violife cheeses, sustainable useful materials and more. 

I love that they have a rewards system on an app. You just check in on Fivestars and add up the points redeemable for menu items when you earn enough.

They have a variety of items on their menu and i love that they serve breakfast. If you are WFPB, this is a great restaurant for you."}
{"text":"I've been to their Go Raw location and they both do a good job. However, there are so many wonderful vegan options in Las Vegas now that it's a little harder to slide by with a great review. I do want to compliment the fact that everything tastes fresh and you can tell they take the extra time to make everything homemade. Also, unlike some other vegan restaurants you can tell that they have a mutual focus between taste and health. I got the BBQ pulled jack sandwich. The \"meat\" was delicious, and the sopapilla made it unique. Also, it's hard to find waffle fries anymore and they did a fantastic job with them: tasty and with a crunch. My husband got the Chile Relleno. I tried his and was glad that I decided on mine. It tasted fine, but again there are so many great vegan restaurants that you don't want just fine. I do want to go back and try another one of their smoothies. They have a Durian one that I am intrigued by."}
{"text":"if your raw -vegan and love high quality organic gourmet food, you will love this cafe . great selection of green food and smoothies."}
{"text":"Very good! Love the outside area! Makes me feel relaxed and comfortable.. I will definitely be returning to try more!"}
{"text":"First time at a vegan cafe.  First time having jack fruit too.  I tried the BBQ pulled \"jackfruit\" (like a pulled pork) sandwich.  They did a good job with it.  The truffle vegan chocolates are amazing.  Overall, great experience.  Very laid back and relaxing vibe."}
{"text":"Calm vibe, good smoothies, yummy fries. Comfy booth and plenty of parking. Service a little slow but overall a decent experience for the vegan, gluten free, or curious healthy eater!"}
{"text":"Used to be a fancy Italian restaurant, so they have some great decor.  The side room has a great fountain with high ceilings and an open-air feel.  Prices aren't a steal, but they aren't too bad and putting healthy fare into your body is worth a few extra bucks.  

The cold-brew coffee with coconut water is one of my favorites, as it's a unique/interesting combination.  I tend to order from the raw menu and am not in love with any particular item, but I'd say they're all just fine.  When I'm in the mood for comfort food, the vegan grilled cheese with tomatoes and sweet potato fries is amazing."}
{"text":"I ate here while vacationing in Las Vegas. The food is healthy and delicious. It is clean, inexpensive & the staff is very friendly. Eat here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was literally just driving and this place along with maybe 3 other stores were in the middle of no where lol naturally I had to stop and give it a shot.
They have a pretty neat little area with a water fountain that you can eat near and the water noises along with their set up back there is a really nice touch to the place.. kind of reminds me of my back yard in Hawaii.
I felt like having a plate with a bunch of different things thrown together so I ordered the nachos. It really probably was the best thing I could have ordered because it was oddly filling and pretty good. Vegan cheese has always been a fear of mine for whatever reason, I have this thing in my head about it not being good because of a past experience but that was not the problem here. 
The other dish was the enchilada which was presented really nice but I wasn't a fan, something was missing but honestly there's only one way to find out and that's me coming here again and making sure it wasn't just an off day for them. I will be back if not for different things on your menu but for the nachos!"}
{"text":"Checked out Go Vegan tonight for the 1st time. I really enjoyed the experience! I picked up my food this time,  but will back to dine in. I didn't  really how big the inside dining area is. Doesn't look it from the outside.

I ordered the Mexi Burger with the roasted jalapenos/waffle fries. And also picked up the enchiladas for the moms. 

Let me tell you,  as one in the transitioning stage of being plant based. The food was phenomenal! I had to remember I was eating a burger! It felt good to eat something and not  feel the bloated or get tired. I was completely satisfied! I look forward to returning and trying other items."}
{"text":"Great food, clean quaint place, good service. Lu was very nice and checked on my son and I to ensure all was well. The only downside is that it's so far from where I live. But I will def return. I ordered the Italian portobello burger and side house salad. My son ordered the sushi; generous portions and really yummy."}
{"text":"There are no words to describe my gratitude that there is a great place to take friends and not be poisoned. Many places are including vegan ,vegetarian  , gluten free items on there menus ! But the eating and having bad reactions are painful, time consuming , and expensive. I have only had great reactions Here! I could live on the coleslaw and green burrito!
Thanks
Hugs"}
{"text":"Hubby and I came for lunch 4/6/16..this was our 3rd visit and I think our last. We both had sandwiches that literally fell apart from too much wet ingredients.  I had eggplant parmigiana which was like a pile of mush. Hubby had a lentil sandwich which had way too much barbeque sauce Both our sandwiches came with sweet potato fries that were dry and hard ( gee, were they reheated left overs?)"}
{"text":"Loved this spot! So happy we stumbled on it before leaving Vegas! Our waitress Misty was super helpful and awesome to talk with. For starters we had a smoothie! Very good and perfectly blended. We ate the nachos/BBG jackfruit sandwich and it was mouthwatering delicious!!! We really enjoyed the amount of desserts but went with the Oreo cake which was AMAZING! Yum!!! We even took some treats to go for our plane ride home! The banana muffin and a brownie! Both so good. We will be back to visit."}
{"text":"We came here with some friends.  The place is dingy,  the AC did not seem to work at all, and it was just about empty when we went in, but maybe because the AC doesn't work :/
    Now the food, we ordered breakfast and I was pleasantly surprised.  Pancakes were great, my friends both got Tofu scrambles and they said were excellent, we shared a side of sausage and this was terrible.  

  The smoothies were good as well.  The water, not so good.  It tasted bad, we all independently thought this but didn't say it till the end of our meal.

Then there is the service, this is where it goes downhill to me.  I assume the owner is who served us; and he although maybe not trying to be rude; was.   A number of times we noticed he would ignore us when we called for him.  There was one other person that came in and he seemed like 2 parties was pushing him to his max of attention.  Then when we did ask for water to drink with our meal, we each noticed him roll his eyes.  

Between the heat in the room which left us sweating and the service, we had to give this place a 2 and will not go back.  It's ashamed because we would love to find a good vegan place."}
{"text":"So my co-worker and I decided to try this place out. Very laid back atmosphere and comfortable seating in the booth. The staff was really friendly and helpful. We started with the nachos for an appetizer. Definitely recommend it. Very tasty. I  had the Eggplant Parmigiano sandwich with a side of potato salad. First time having this item. It was delicious. Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The food was great! $13 for a black bean classic burger with sweet potato fries topped with daiya cheese. I really enjoyed my meal! The only downside is the clack of customer service. When I walked in, it didn't even seem like they were open for customers. The walls are bare, half of the restaurant isn't even lit and there's no counter or menus on the wall. You walk in and kind of guess where you're supposed to go. Anyways, the older guy with glasses gave me a menu and didn't say much to me after that. I had to get up and go to him to order (he was watching tv on his iPad). He literally said \"what do you want to order?\"  I gave him my order and he did not say another word to me until he brought my food out. This was extremely awkward since I was the only one in there. A couple walked in while I was waiting. He didn't greet them at all. They took a glance at the salad bar and walked out-2 potential customers missing out on a really delicious meal! Maybe they're just not worried about engaging new customers with good service or even a \"Hi, welcome to my new restaurant !\" For a new restaurant, I guess I just expected more attention to a new customer. Great yummy, organic, vegan food! Sub-par customer service."}
{"text":"health food sells. cost $$ but keep in mind cheaper food is not as healthy so treat your health to this. food is delicious not heavy. tried a new organic drink kombucha like yogurt it has cultures - good for digestion. wanted more from the menu but takes self control if you wanna get on the right track. the selections are almost like a fusion but take a wiser choice of food types. 
restaurant offers salad buffet also. there is a shelving section for vegan organic products from supplements to books.
booth seating and garden relaxing tables are available. 
staff is pleasant. order with a smile :-)"}
{"text":"Amazing place with awesome staff! The desserts are amazing. Also had the veggie pizza. It was amazing. The cheese was melted and honey and so tasty. Awesome place for eating out and healthy! Would recommend"}
{"text":"This place is incredible!! Delicious vegan comfort food and a very healthy store with books too. I absolutely love that most of their menu is gluten free. 

I had the Mexi-Cali scramble- YUM! The cheesy tofu was divine. And potatoes were perfectly seasoned and herbed. The GF muffin is the most delicious treat. With a side of Green Zing fresh juice. Tons of greens, kale, apple, lemon and ginger.

I was recommended here by my friends and I'm super glad I came. It was my last supper before heading back to California and it was the perfect touch to my trip. Now I have a new fave in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Always passed this cafe on the way home and wanted to try it out! After a long wait at the DMV i decided to give this place a shot. The one that attracted me most was their eggplant parmigiano. I saw loaded pictures and review about it. 

I came in and i fell in love with its atmosphere. The outside fountain was soothing to hear while looking their menu. I see myself coming here to do work or study. The people who work were very welcoming and friendly. The lady made sure i was comfortable and helped me on picking out what to get. Originally came here for the eggplant sandwich but i was also drawn to their enchilada dish! Her and a few workers also recommended the dessert area. Did i got up and checked it out? I sure did. Got me some truffles! 

Ended up with the eggplant parmigiano and i must say it was great. My order wasn't as loaded as the ones i've seen in pictures. My eggplant wasn't fully baked which was sort of how to chew. It was okay though. Overall it filled me up. The waffle cut fries were seasoned to the point, i wanted more. 
Then again, i had to refuse because i had truffles waiting for me."}
{"text":"I hate giving low reviews, but I have to because this place is a mess.
1.) we waited 45 mins for our food, no update.. no apology.. nothing. This place was dead btw, not busy at all...My mom had to go inside ( because we sat outside) and ask a waitress to please fill her glass with water because she came and filled mine and my boyfriends water but walked away from my mom when she put her glass up asking for water... 
2.) my mom can't eat onions, they don't sit right with her so she asked for no onions on her BBQ sandwich and when we finally 45 mins later received the food, there was pickled onion on it AND onion in the mixture with the mushrooms. ( which we didn't know about the onions  being in the mix as well if it had just been the pickled onions on top we could have just picked it off and be fine with it. ) She sent it back asking to take it off of the bill  and didn't bother re ordering since it took so long for our original order. 
3.) THIS is the most angering part of our experience here. We told the woman up front about what happened with my moms order and here's her response \" oh. Well if you would have said you had an allergy we would have not put onions on it.\"
To which I replied \" if a customer asks for an item to not be on her plate it shouldn't be there we shouldn't have to say it's an allergy.\" Her response made me very angry because to me it sounded like if you don't have an allergy and request your food that you're paying for a certain way, we won't do it. There's more than just allergy reasons to not have an ingredient in the food you're paying for to not be on the plate. 
She was dismissive and tried to pass blame on my mom for them messing up the order. 
4.) the food was not worth this hassle. 

Not good. Never will be back. No thanks."}
{"text":"This is my favorite vegan breakfast/lunch spot in town. The atmosphere is cozy. I like the indoor patio area. The real reason I keep coming back is for the vegan food and coffee!

The scrambles are the best I've had. The eggs are such a good texture and flavor. Plus, a delicious muffin and roasted potatoes are included. I also enjoy the burgers and salads. 

My only con is the price... expect to spend $20 here for lunch with an entree and drink. 

Also, there is no outdoor patio to bring your four legged friend. 

Overall, a great find!"}
{"text":"Got the portobello wrap and husband got mexi burger. The portobello wrap has a lot of flavor just needed more veggies the mexi veggie burger my husband had I think it's a great idea with the chile that they used for chile relleno, but the party was kind of mushy it needed to be cooked more and I expected the avocado fries to be crunchy like I've tried them in other places they were just dipped in bread crumbs or something and only 4."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for the eggplant sandwich. Vegan and GF! Really good food. I can't wait to come back for pizza"}
{"text":"I just finished eating my Mediterranean salad and it was amazing! After a long weekend of picking at Thanksgiving leftovers, it feels good to eat something green! The dressing was amazing, simple but tart in the best way. I also really loved the little cracker things they put on top, they were very yummy.  I will definitely be back, I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere out by the fountain. 
Our server was friendly. Food came out fast. I had the quesadilla and it was good. The \"cheese\" was a bit too rich for my liking but the tomatoes helped tone it down a bit. 
We will return & tell friends :)"}
{"text":"Finally, after passing by this place a million times on my way home from work, I stopped by. I checked the menu. Soooo many different choices. All of them sound so delicious!! I wasn't too hungry, but to give it a try I ordered waffle cut sweet potato fries. The flavor was veeerry good. Although, the fries were a but too chewy for my liking. I also ordered a tropical (coconut/mango) tostada. It sounded super delicious, but unfortunately at the time; they didn't have coconut butter. So I was unable to try it. 


I shall be back!! Ahaha"}
{"text":"** THIS IS ACTUALLY A 2 STAR REVIEW. IM A BUSINESS OWNER AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF REVIEWS AND REPUTATION. SO IM LEAVING THIS REVIEW SO THE OWNERS WILL GET IT TOGETHER**

I hate leaving bad reviews but I just paid $14 for a small smoothie and a half cup of soup? The employee was nice but that's kinda overkill. Smoothie was good and soup was decent but it was literally broth and nothing else inside. Also while I was there a customer came in and asked one of the workers for a smoothie that will give her energy and his reply was read the ingredients. If you're serving healthy food workers should be somewhat knowledgeable especially if your paying these kind of prices. I waited almost 10 mins for a cup of soup that just needed to be poured and handed to me and the place was dead

The 2 stars are for the nice server and the smoothie was good."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. A bit away from the strip so you're definitely riding in a car to get there-totally worth it though. My sisters and I loved it. My meat eating sister said her burger was a little mushy so maybe ask them to make it crispy if you order one. I got the Spanish breakfast burrito and it was fantastic. My sister loves the sushi, my little sister LOVED the vegan pizza (and she's tried a lot of vegan pizza and is never satisfied), and my other sister (I know there's a lot of us) got the enchilada and devoured it. They also had dessert options which were so freaking good: I had the carrot cake, one had the raspberry chocolate, and the other had Oreo (which she said was little dry) and the strawberry shortcake cake which was the best out of all. 
Highly recommend for former vegans! The only complaint was the server we had: she seemed not \"all there\" and would make super intense eye contact and was very \"high\" sounding."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? The staff is incredible. Kind as can be. The menu is extensive and there is yet to be an item I don't like. The atmosphere is incredible. 

It's a perfect place for parties, family outings, or a quick bite at the salad bar."}
{"text":"I came here for an order of avocado fries, and even though it was a small order and they were served cold, I did enjoy them. They also some delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen this place is my new favorite restaurant on planet earth. After Go  Raw, now Go Vegan with vegan pizza that tastes amazing. Stop by and be amazed! My girlfriend and I are just speechless in pleasure at the salads, the pizza and the quesadilla. Yummy!"}
{"text":"impressed with this place for sure! there are so many unique food options to choose from. it's exciting! lol. their food is delicious!! and the atmosphere is pleasing as well. i'll be back! (:"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! The tofu scramble is hands down the best I've ever had. The pancakes and waffles were scrumptious and the grilled cheese with spicy sweet potato fries was delicious. My kids and I went here three times during a recent trip to Vegas for dance. Really loved the salad bar and dessert bar too. We even brought our non-vegan friends and they loved it too. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was great and the menu is delightful! However the lentil loaf was dry and not a lot of flavor, the side veggies were great! I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries which they only give 8 crisscut fries total. I definitely will give it another try cause as I stated the menu is really inviting. My first experience wasn't great."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times- the first visit I ordered the raw Mediterranean wrap - the half portion- and it was really good although I was still kind of hungry- my husband ordered a pancake which he thought was ok. We went a second time and he ordered a pizza which he thought was ok and I ordered the lentil loaf sandwich which I thought was good but again - the portion was on the small side. I really want my husband to like this place for health reasons so I talked him into coming again even though he wasn't thrilled about it - he does love the sweet potato fries- I ordered the half Mediterranean wrap again - I wanted to order the whole wrap bc I thought the half might not be quite enough but it's hard to bring myself to pay the $14 for the full size order ($8 for half) -it's casual dining after all- I received the wrap and it was even smaller than the first time- I mean really small - it was basically 2raw collard greens with a few sprouts and a tablespoon of hummus thrown in with a couple of diced cucumbers and tomatoes - literally a couple. I was still pretty hungry after that and ended up ordering another menu item - $8 for \"cheese\" fries- again small portion - so I spent $16 for my food and it felt like a kids meal. I talked my husband into ordering the lentil loaf sandwich $10 -bc I liked it and wanted him to like this place - again he thought it was just ok and said he was still hungry. I don't mind paying what we did to eat - but paying what we did and leaving hungry kind of sucks  I think the food is good and the people are nice kind of - the lady with the dreads is very nice but the portions are just off.  My husband says we aren't going back - I tried"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here to have lunch, we had the cheese fries, asian burger and some samples from the salad bar. The staff was great and friendly. The food tasted great. My only complaint is that I wish they would give you more fries with your meal, we barely got any :("}
{"text":"Go Vegan Cafe is absolutely disgusting. Wow. Right upon sitting down the table was dirty with crumbs. Everything is bland, unflavorful, and has a weird after taste. We ordered the enchiladas, the classic burger, and the eggplant parmesan sandwich. The whole environment is unclean and just gross. The enchiladas were terrible, the jackfruit had no flavour and there was a certain taste that was just so unpleasant. The classic burger was not a firm burger and the corn and black beans were not appealing. The fries were bland as well. The only good thing was the eggplant parmesan, but it was so so small. Maybe the waffles or pancakes would've been decent. The environment was just a no. Go to Vegenation downtown if you want good vegan food, if you want shitty ass bland overpriced food come here. Cook your own vegan food at home! This place sucks!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Recently opened my food horizon to the Vegan side of things and I must say from what I've had here it is quite delicious, the Raw Burgers on the Rawtilla's are great, Ive had the Raw Mediterranean Burger which is my Favorite also ive had the Portobello, it too is good however I wish it would have had more thicker Shrooms to really give it that Mushroom taste you would want out of a Portobello Burger, The avocado fry's that are dusted in that seasoning with the hummus is a perfect side. I look forward to trying more from their menu however im kinda stuck on the Raw side of things at the moment so the Burgers are the only thing ive had here.. Service can be a little slow however why be in such a rush, PURA VIDA!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I love Go Raw, but my 5yo is impartial, GoVegan is super yummy for both our palates! And gluten free goodness!

And the sky-lighted dining area with statue fountain and live plants is a beautiful way to enjoy our meal!"}
{"text":"I had to try this place, The service was good, the decors was 1960-70. A little bit of everything everywhere,  from books to juice bar, fridge and self serve buffet in the middle, supplement on the shelves  and seats to eat. I was surprised how this place was dark and  so not welcoming. After seating, the service was good. I order the classic burger, who came in a very timely manner in a plastic plate with very cheap silverware. The burger was tasteless and very fulfilling.. the outside veranda was full of dusty plastic plants.... this place need a new owner with a different vision. Vegan is not what is used to be and can be so much better. Price of my burger was $15.35"}
{"text":"I give two stars because of a woman who is manager is very rude and she lied us or she did not know ingredients of the bakery products. She told us that cakes and sweet breads DO NOT have sugar which is not right. Icing on the cake is loaded with sugar but the layers are sweetened with coconut sugar. This attitute is dangerous for her clients health. I also think that some items in the salad bar were not fresh. I liked very much my eggplant sandwich and baked fries."}
{"text":"So so happy to have found this place in Vegas. I have celiac so am highly sensitive to gluten and feel anxious going to new restaurants that may cross contaminate but this place made me feel so comfortable.

All Vegan, everything is gluten free except for one item that they get from an outside source and has seitan in it. 

I got a coconut and raw burger and it was incredible. I will be back every day that I am staying in vegas!

Highly recommend for anyone with gluten sensitivity or who is vegan."}
{"text":"Go Vegan Cafe has the greatest pancakes (and everything else for that matter). I took my girlfriend here, who is vegan, and I found the best tasting pancakes and waffles that I've ever consumed (vegan and non-vegan).

I wish that they oped a location in Los Angeles or Palm Springs so that we stuff our faces with amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"First time checking this place out yesterday's and.... Delicious vegan food, large menu on raw and hot options and the atmosphere and staff are amazing! Definitely taking all my people here. Thanks for the awesome service and eats!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE and someday I'll live closer and visit regularly. 

My dad and fiancé are not vegan, but both enjoy the food regardless.

My dad and I went here for lunch and had a very relaxing time with delicious food. We ordered the following:

Yummy \"Grilled Cheese & Tomato\" with delectable \"Sweet & Spicy Fries\"
Excellent \"Eggplant Parmigiano\" with Mouth watering \"Coleslaw\"
Best Ever \"Cold-pressed Coffee & Coconut Water over Ice\"

During another visit, I ordered a decadent Double Layer jelly filled Chocolate Cake to bring home for my guy and it's to die for! 

In fact, today we're currently awaiting delivery of that cake, Chile Relleno, Enchiladas & Cheese Fries. I'm certain the food will be the highlight of our day and it's been a great day! 

Restaurant Details:
I love the garden area with the fountain. It's sometimes difficult to hear out there from the echo of the water fountain, but I still love it. Inside is pleasant and inviting too. The ambiance is so peaceful that it's somewhat romantic. The place is spacious with a quaint feel. There's a salad bar full of fresh, wonderful looking produce, a bakery counter with enticing sweets and a juice bar.  

Service Details:
They never rush you. In fact, they invite you to make yourself at home which brings a sense of relief from the madness of the day. Everyone I encountered was friendly, caring and attentive to requests. 

I also attended an awesome Raw Food Workshop here and look forward to attending more! Check out govegan.cafe for details. 

Browsing the books for sale and discovering other things in the market section that I never knew existed was cool.

I think this would be a great place to do some studying, research, reading, writing, etc. 

Oh...as for the wait at the Café, I was busy dealing with a situation on the phone while we waited for our meal, so it didn't seem like it took long at all. 

And, the food we ordered today was delivered by onlinerestaurants.com. The driver was delightful and the grub was absolutely delicious!

Thanks for reading! Hope to see you there sometime!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite vegan restaurant in Las Vegas. Not only do they have AMAZING vegan food, half of their menu is RAW and they are really good for allergies. The service is a little long but that is because their food is so fresh. They also have a salad bar which has more than just salads. They have multiple dessert options as well. They are conveniently located so this is my GO-TO spot for meetups with my friends. You feel like you are at home with the service! There is not anything on the menu that disappointed me! 

WOOHOO #govegan"}
{"text":"My honey treated me to this lovely place today. It's owned and run by the same fine folks as go raw cafe and they really set the standard for good for u goodness.  Loved the fact that it's vegan comfort food, wow wow wow!!! 

Ordered lentil loaf, mexi burger and gluten free pancakes with spicy mango nut mix on top. Damn good!! 

Mexi burger comes with roasted peppers, slaw and daiya cheese on a gluten free bun..so excellent. Came with  side of  guac, ketchup and pico... Incredible. Lentil loaf did not disappoint either. Very hearty, savory and yummy yummy. Comes with pan fried potato awesomeness. No left overs from this food adventure, that's how yummy it was.

Didn't love the gf pancakes, they were a bit on the mushy side, but I think u can only do so much with vegan AND gluten free. Taste-wise, they were a win, just not in love with the texture..  Either way, meal was amazing. A Vegan, vegetarian or carnivore could fall in love with this spot, so give it a try. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"So HAPPY to find this place!!  First time since going Vegan I have been able to have pancakes. It was defiantly worth the wait!!!  So, yes I had Mixed berry Pancakes with added bananas and nuts YUM!!  My husband has the Mexi-Burger it looked Fabulous. He Loved his as well. Then to top it off we had cheese waffle fries with guac and poco de gallo. Again not to disappoint!!  Meet Lu the owner SUPER SWEET!!  Service is Excellent. Believe me we will be back again and again. Now if only the had a brunch with Mimosas!! . Please check it out friendly casual and great food DONE!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Great service and great food.  I don't mind driving to come here.  Never disappoints..highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today it was SO good! Had the raw feast...plan on going back again and again! So glad I stumbled upon this awesome place! The pic doesn't show how damn delicious it was! Haha!"}
{"text":"My wife must eat Gluten free and I am a carnivore, so we need to find somewhere it is great tasting as well as healthy:  The Vegan Café is defiantly in this category.  

We tried the breakfast and both had a Tofu scramble.  Mine a Mexicali with pinto beans, vegan cheese and very fresh guacamole.  Hers was the Spanish with roasted veggies and she added roasted Jalapenos.  Both were excellent and filled us all day:  I'd match these scrambles against any regular egg dishes anytime.   The veggies were fresh and crisp as well as varied and abundant (I think that's enough adjectives for now...)

I recommend asking for the homemade Jalapeno hot sauce.   It is for those who love it hot.   I wanted to take the container home.

We came back specifically to try the dinner menu of enchiladas and BBQ jackfruit sandwich.      The enchilada was very good with fresh Guacamole and a good tortilla.   

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the jackfruit sandwich unless you like enjoy your BBQ bland.   I missed the spicy kick of a good sauce.  Additionally the gluten free roll was chewy.   In their defense I've found very few gluten free bread products that are good.   It's hard to pull off as whatever gluten is, it is delicious.    

Please give this place a try as they are hurting with the road construction being done in the area.   We will be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! The woman who helped me was very accommodating and explained to me what their desserts consisted of. I ordered the BBQ pulled jack sandwich and it was everything I expected and more. As a vegetarian, this was a life saver! I'll be coming back, if not for the exact same thing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here minimum once a week (thankfully it's down the street too). We love love love their food, never had a bad meal here in all honesty. I appreciate that there is raw and cooked options, as I go back and forth between the two. Their customer service is also awesome, always very welcoming whether we dine in or take out (they know our favorites now too). Best fully vegan place in town with high quality ingredients! Don't forget to try the Oreo truffle too."}
{"text":"The service is Horrible, it's the Same owners as \"Raw\",in Henderson,the guy with the ponytail first served us 3yrs back at Raw, he has absolutely No Personality. He just wants to be Somewhere Else. We walk in, waited for him to seat us, he just looks at you like a Zombie ,says nothing but stares, finally I asked him if we should seat ourselves,he nods yes, he's like right out of a Vincent Price Horror Movie ( Silent Film) we sit and he just stands around, finally I go back up to him ask for a menue,he points to them,than after 5 minutes I call out That we're ready to order, he comes & takes the order, He asked if we wanted water,we said YES. He Never Brought the Water, after Another 20 minutes, A Spanish girl brought out food, she was friendly, BUT SPOKE NO BASIC ENGLISH, Was Confused with the Food Order, tried asking her for water, I Finally asked in ITALIAN, and she got it.THE ZOMBIE JUST STROLLED AROUND AIMLESSLY doing unimportant things,like moving a chair, looking at the buffet, as if it was going to Talk, instead of checking on customers, especially since He was the Only One who spoke English, He Never Once Checked on us, Never Asked if we wanted Desserts or Anything, We had to walk up front and ask for the bill, we wanted to leave, we would of liked desserts and a drink, We were Never Asked. We were in the waterfall room,one other couple in the front room with the zombie, The place was Empty, the customer service should of been better, Poor Service, The Food was a little oily,tasty,good. WE Felt like we where in the way of the Zombies house cleaning,although he only moved a chair closer to a table. That was so important in an Empty Resturant.Servings are small,it's good,but we left a little hungry. Would of liked to order more, But No Service. Friendly Spanish girl, but she can't speak  Basic English, she can't communicate,The ZOMBIE has no personality, speaks English, BUT DOESNT TALK and Obviously is in the Wrong Business. Place is Empty 4 a reason for a DINNER ON A SATURDAY NIGHT. Should not be. No one catering to customers. We left a little hungry, would of liked to Order more, But NO SERVICE !!  NO TIP ! HOWS THAT 4 YOUR KARMA !!  NO TIP !"}
{"text":"I paid $18 for a whatever burger and a skimpy amount of fries.... I heard such good things about this place and I'm pretty upset about the cost vs what's given. Won't be returning. I'll stick to my go to vegan spots from now on."}
{"text":"Awesome healthy vegan food. They seem to focus on less soy products, more veggies. Perfect for a light lunch. And if you eat in, they have a pleasant atrium complete with a large water fountain."}
{"text":"Go Vegan Cafe is one of my go-to's especially when I'm eating all raw vegan.  Their raw burgers and raw wraps are absolutely delicious and flavorful.  Definitely a local favorite."}
{"text":"Been grabbing a Shake or juice after my yoga and today I really enjoyed the super food Shake!! Amazing! They offer a discount to vegas hot yoga students- I totally forgot to mention it this morning, so don't forget if you go!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here during our visit to Vegas. We loved their pancakes and fresh juices. We also tried their tofu scramble and sausages. All their food is full of flavor and great portions. If you're looking for a healthy food choice, great price, delicious food and positive environment then I suggest you go to this place. We will definitely be back on our next visit. 

Oh and did I mention they have a points system to receive free items. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a simple house salad 35 min later still no salad and the place was completely dead, these Vegans give Vegans a bad name. I asked for a refund and walked out"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on our way out of Vegas and we're really impressed with the extensive menus! There was a full page of cooked vegan, a full page of raw vegan as well as a full salad bar & small grocery type store with baked goods & a few specialty vegan products. 

I ordered a breakfast burrito. I can't remember what my husband had ordered, but we we're both impressed with the quality, taste & value for money spent. 

There aren't a ton of vegan options on the strip, especially if you haven't won big at the casino (they are very expensive). I highly recommend travelling for food, there are some real gems just a short Uber ride away!"}
{"text":"AWESOME place for a healthy and tasty meal! And you can sign up for a reward program which is quite generous. A discount or a small free dish every 3 or so meals. Love this place. 
Keep up the good work Go Vegan Cafe"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed some of the dishes here, except the veggie burger.  Very lacking in flavor and texture.  The juice bar is decent, but the lady that took my order was lacking in customer service."}
{"text":"What a great find. I had some vegan family in town so we went on a hunt for vegan restaurants. The staff was very friendly and helpful in suggesting menu items. We had a pizza, burger, salad, and smoothies. Not being vegan myself, I tasted everything and was surprisingly satisfied with everything."}
{"text":"All I have to say to you... is tofu scramble. And breakfast burrito. These are so amazing it's unreal. Except it is real. This is hands down one of the best vegan spots I have ever been to. Juices, raw menu, burgers, breakfast. I love it!! So much variety on the menu."}
{"text":"All I can say is yum! 
Very clean and the food smells great
Everyone is so nice. Always my 1st stop after I fly into town. 
The salad bar is fantastic! So fresh and huge.
Be careful they do not have good signage for night time, don't pass it by..."}
{"text":"First time I've eaten at a Vegan restaurant, and I've got to admit I was very impressed by the overall quality. The food tasted healthy and fresh while still full of flavor.

I've been looking to eat less meat and dairy for health reasons, and we were nearby so decided to give it a try. I've had a few vegan dishes that surprised me lately, so this place seamed like something I really wanted to try. Both my wife and I were very happy with the outcome.

Just an FYI before I talk about the food we ordered, this place has a full menu of cooked vegan items and raw vegan items. I understand some vegans don't want to eat anything cooked (I don't get that one at all, but to each their own) so this place has plenty of options in that area to. My wife and I stuck to cooked food though. They also have full selection of fresh juices and smoothies.

I ordered the Spanish southwest scramble, which uses tofu and vegan cheese to emulate an egg scramble. It came with breakfast potatoes and a vegan chocolate muffin. My wife got the grilled veggie sandwich, which comes with a side (my wife chose potato salad.

We sat in the patio area, which is still indoors but is beautiful and has a nice fountain in it. The staff was extremely pleasant and our server offered recommendations, and later even told us a bit about how the food is prepared.

The food came out and it was honestly some of the best plating I have ever seen outside of a fine dining establishment. The use of greens and the different colors from the plates and veggies just made everything pop out. I recommend checking the pictures for this place.

The scramble was incredible, and I would defy anyone to think this wasn't an egg dish. The breakfast potatoes were very good, and the muffin was good to, though much denser than a normal muffin. The veggie sandwich and potato salad were also very good. Both the scramble and sandwich used vegan cheese and you really couldn't tell it wasn't dairy.

I only have one real complaint and that is the portion sizes for the price. The building that Go Vegan Café is full of health related places (yoga, herbal supplements, etc.) and the portions are probably very healthy for you in terms of calories. Us Americans are used to big meals, and I'm OK with the smaller size provided (heck, I would be far better off eating smaller portions),  but I can't help but think the prices should be just a tad lower. My wife's sandwich was made with bread smaller than your typical loaf you'd get at a grocery store, and it wasn't exactly loaded with veggies. My omelet was also small and they portion of breakfast potations was the smallest potato side I have probably ever had with a meal. I wonder if they just charge more because this is in a ritzier part of town where people are used to paying more, or if they charge more because the vegan food is so labor intensive to prepare. I hope the latter.

Speaking of prices, their juice and smoothie menu seemed really overpriced. It scared me away from trying anything on it, but based on their food I would think their fresh drinks are very good.

I don't want anyone to think I'm being overly negative about the prices here, as I'm not trying to be. This place was very, very good. I actually wish it was closer to where I live, as I am on the other side of town, and I would be stopping here regularly if it wasn't such a drive. I am planning on going here again if I end up on that side of town again soon.

This is a great place for a light and healthy meal. Its a perfect spot for breakfast or lunch, and don't let the Vegan thing scare you away. Even devout carnivores would enjoy a meal here."}
{"text":"The lady working here seemed completely unsympathetic when I told her my car just broke down and it's so hot outside.  I don't know why she treated me so poorly.  Her cold heart most certainly doesn't want to make me go back there.  She left a poor first impression with me.  Her juices weren't even very good.  She uses the wrong high speed juicer.  She needs the Norwalk juicer because most of the juices are going straight to the trash can with her high speed juicer and your getting mostly water.  You can tell because if you leave her juice on the table for a minute it separates and you get water at the bottom.  Norwalk juicer doesn't do that.  You get the full nutrition with the right juicer.  She is using the wrong type of juicer.

The lady working there was very rude with no people skills.  It wouldn't have even mattered if they made the juice properly.  Her bad attitude and poor demeanor would have still made it hard for the juice to go down"}
{"text":"Great spot! 
I am not a vegan yet I very much enjoy this place. 
The freshly opens young Thai coconuts are delicious and their raw menu is awesome. The mexi-wrap is my favorite.  
Much recommended"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Super nice staff and very fast! Food could't be more delicious! I would like to find a place like this everywhere! Fully recomendable! Vegans heaven!"}
{"text":"Really amazing for a house salad! The only reason it didn't get 5  is because it's a salad and all I want are nachos (which I think they actually have so that's a must-try). Staff was extremely friendly. Looking forward to my return."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I was under the impression that it was just a juice bar with a raw menu, which typically I find boring. Now, there's nothing wrong with raw veganism, but I do like my comfort food when I eat out.

First of all, the food here is absolutely delicious! And it's not \"just a juice bar\" at all--the menu is HUGE! Not only was my meal super comforting, but it was healthy. We ate a ton and still felt amazing afterwards.

Everything was so fresh and and the flavors were very satisfying. Eating outside in the covered courtyard with the fountain and all the plants was peaceful and relaxing. Pretty sure I almost fell asleep--in a good way.

Very happy with Go Vegan Cafe. My boyfriend said this was the best tofu scramble he's ever had. I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely best place in Vegas to go for living raw food , vary cause vary down to earth, I had a great since of peace walking in and out of there Establishm"}
{"text":"My family recently switched to a plant based diet, and after a little research by my husband we decided to try this place based on the reviews. 

*Pros- My BBQ jack fruit with coleslaw on sopes and the hubby's MexiCali burger were both delicious. We also enjoyed sitting out in their enclosed patio area. 

*Cons- The service was pretty lackluster and it took forever till someone actually came out to bring even some water ( we were acknowledged when first walking in). While it looks plentiful in the photo the side of fries they give you is super small, at least my serving was. That however wasn't the big blunder but the fact that my waffle fries tasted like day old reheated fries and they weren't even hot. Just room temperature like they'd sat out forever. I brought this to the attention of our waitress and she was kind of dumbstruck. Her reply was a \" Oh umm, okay. Sorry\". Just that and nothing else, no comp on our bill or offer of fresher fries. My toddler was with us and like most her age loves fries. She wouldn't even eat them, so that's telling you something. 

Overall I'm willing to go back and try again but maybe try something else and ordering to go."}
{"text":"AMAZING.

Keep in mind that I am not Vegan... I do eat healthy but so a non Vegan this food is amazing. You get what paid for.. Prices are very reasonable and it feels so relaxing at this place. If you do decide to go you must try there Vegan Meatloaf.  Sounds weird at first for non Vegans but trust me give it a try."}
{"text":"I got the loaf gluten free with vegetables and potatoes, and it was pretty good. My daughter got the pancakes topped with apple, and it was very good. We will definitely be going again. There are so many things to n the menu, I cannot wait to try more."}
{"text":"I read the reviews ahead of time and knew there would be a wait. That being said, it was not too bad. The food was amazing!! I had the Mexi burger and my wife had the Pulled Jack BBQ sandwich! A great blend of flavor in every bite!! We'll be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I had the Mexicali omelette, and it was amazing! Everything is vegan, and there are a lot of gluten-free options, too. I also had a ginger shot that was equally as amazing. Nothing sugar-coated about this place (pardon the pun), just good food for a fair price."}
{"text":"The nicest servers , and really good quality food! Definitely  worth the drive off the strip !"}
{"text":"Our family is not vegan but we are gluten free and the Go Vegan Cafe is the perfect fit for our family. 
2 of our group had the apple cinnamon waffles. They were cooked perfectly and did not have the usual chemical taste that GF waffles have. They were very flavorful. 
1 person (10 year old) has a \"burger\" and fries. For a vegan burger it was very good. I am sure it would have been even better had the child wanted it loaded instead of plain and dry. The fries were few but very delicious! He said they were better than fast food fries. 
My husband and I ordered from the raw menu. They were both very good. I had the jicama fries with my meal. There were 4 slices and it was served with hummus and it was as I expected. My Mediterranean meal was delightful with the beet burger."}
{"text":"We just started vegan eating... came here today for lunch. I know the owner, Lou, who is fantastic. We ordered comfort food- hamburger and a pulled jackfruit sandwich. The food was very fresh and delicious. The sides were just as good. I asked Lou a lot of questions and she was so gracious ... gave me some good ideas for cooking at home too. We'll definitely be back and will bring friends who aren't vegan... I know they'll be impressed!"}
{"text":"Placed an order through Yelp for pick up. I go there and they say the lady at the register said she sees no order, even though our order was already ready and right next to her register. The guy then came out and said that was our order and he was extremely rude. The food did not taste good. Ordered mexi and mediterranean burger, both tasted gross. The guac was extremely sour."}
{"text":"I adore this place. Amazing menu, quality ingredients and really friendly service. Love the atmosphere and decor here too. Coming from San Diego where vegan restaurants are so processed and unoriginal this was a great change. Please open one in SD!! Got the omelette and waffles and both were amazing"}
{"text":"There are definitely not enough vegan/raw restaurants in Las Vegas so I really do appreciate this place & its sister property, Go Raw Cafe. The food is pretty decent, and the shakes are yummy. Their vegan iced mocha is by far one of my favorite mochas ever! Their customer service isn't always on point...sometimes it takes a while for them to notice you standing at the counter. The cafe's setup also needs some work. You are supposed to order at one counter and then walk across to restaurant to another counter to pay. Just a little awkward. Their prices are a little more on the expensive side for a cafe, but that's to be expected at health conscious eateries. Overall, Go Vegan Cafe is a good place to catch a bite if you are in the mood for something healthy. 

UPDATE: I just gave their jackfruit tacos & eggplant parm a try. They were sooooo good that I needed to give them the extra star. I still think the setup needs work, but with food like that, who cares?!?"}
{"text":"So I accidentally stumbled across this gem and you can best believe my next stop won't be an accident lol. 
Go Vegan Cafe has so many options that I literally started salivating while looking over the menu, they have everything from freshly made and super healthy smoothies to superbly made sandwhiches, tacos, quesadillas, and much much more. 

First the customer service was exceptional, the staff seemed very relaxed and friendly. As I waited for my meal to be ready I was offered a sample of their \"kookier and kreme \" smoothie and it was absolutely delicious!! I didn't order it because I didn't bring much money with me (I will next time though). 

I walked around this place and there is plenty of seating on the inside, then I saw the outdoor portion. It contained a magnificent water fall structure with greenery, beautiful pieces of art on the walls and the temperature felt great as it was well ventilated. I sat out here and I was impressed by how relaxing it was despite it being 105 degrees outside. You would t know it by sitting in this area. 

I ordered the Buffalo jack fruit sandwich, with a side of sweet potato waffle fries (you have a choice of a side). I wasn't impressed with this plate but I ate it anyway because I was very hungry. Also, this was my first time trying jack fruit so it wasn't a clever choice on my part as I didn't know what to expect. I also ordered the classic quesadilla and it was delicious!!! 

I plan to go back and order more food because they have so much variety I feel like I did myself a disservice not bringing more money to spend there lol next time I'll bring enough to order at least half the menu 

From the famous words of the Terminator....\"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"Was looking for a vegan place on this side of town and found Go Vegan Cafe. Great ambiance inside and they have a large salad bar. We sat on the outside section covered by a canopy and a water fountain in the middle of it. 
We ordered he bbq jackfruit  sandwich and the classic breakfast burrito along with the greenhouse juice. The portions are really small for the price you pay. I understand it's a vegan gluten free cafe so it comes at a price but I've been to multiple vegan cafes in LA who offer similar items with similar prices with much bigger portions. The bbq sandwich was okay. We make these at home so it didn't taste like anything special. The classic breakfast burrito was pretty good tho. Tortilla seemed fresh. It was just way too small though. 
The greenhouse juice is pretty good. I would add some raw honey or agave to it. But It is an alkaline drink so it is best in its pure state. 
3.5 stars overall. 5 stars for service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch here. My raw mediterranean burger with nut patty was yummy and super filling! I don't think the fries were worth the extra $ since you only get a few, I'd probably skip those next time. Our food took about 30 minutes to come out, but thankfully we weren't in a hurry. I will visit again for sure, maybe do the salad bar and fresh juice or smoothie, and enjoy the courtyard if the weather is nice! Love finding vegan places in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Although I did enjoy the scenery the food was Horrible. I am vegan wife is vegetarian and my son eats whatever he gets his hands on lol. Ordered tacos for myself my wife ordered pizza and my son had a tofu scramble. My son usually eats enough for 2 grown men but he didn't take more than 2 bites of the food. I tasted it myself because I was curious and I had to spit it out. Mind you, I haven't had to spit food out in years. Wifey's pizza had no flavor and she scrapped the cheese off the top and just ate the bread. How can u go wrong with pizza. Oh yea and the waiter forgot to put in my order of tacos so never tasted those... disappointed and still hungry."}
{"text":"The food here is beyond delicious!! All of the highest quality-organic-gluten free to cater to the most discriminating palate or special diet needs.  Awesome location for a girls day or date night. Next to Vegas hot and the float tanks. You can have cooked food or raw as well as juices smoothies and baked goods. Yum yum!!"}
{"text":"I feel like trial and error got me to review this place with a more well informed opinion. I've tried a couple sandwiches here including the pulled pork and the eggplant parm ones. They're so yummy (esp the parm) but tiny! I found myself wanting more and leaving still hungry. Then I tried the raw burgers. They are definitely different if you aren't used to raw vegan food, which I wasn't when I first tried it, but now I always find myself coming back for the raw portobello burger with the nut patty. It's so filling and you feel so good after eating it! Your body processes the raw food so much better and you find yourself feeling healthy af for the rest of the day! Maybe that's just me but this is now one of my go to spots for vegan food. Also they have a really awesome patio that's so relaxing. Definitely try this place if you're more experienced in the vegan community"}
{"text":"Amazing, yum yummy yum. Eat here you won't regret it. Love the old Go Raw Cafe? Then come here for sure! Raw and vegan treats!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. The food is BOMB AF and on top of that the service is fantastic. The waitress was so nice she even recommended a few other vegan places in the Las Vegas area to go before heading back home to DC. 10/10 would recommend to anyone vegan or not."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! My husband and I were passing through town, and got takeout from here, as we like to try vegan/raw vegan restaurants wherever we travel. We ordered a raw veggie burger, raw tostada, and raw pizza, and all were super delicious."}
{"text":"Great service, food was just ok in my opinion. There are better vegan places in this area... I will come back to try some other stuff, maybe I just didn't enjoy what I ordered as much... They have a really cute outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Wow. I can't believe I didn't like this place the first go round. I'm absolutely amazed with the food, atmosphere, and overall vibe of this place. I think the first time I ate here I ordered off the raw menu without knowing. Its not that the food was \"bad\", but if your eating raw food and you don't know it you can be a little thrown off. Today I ordered the classic breakfast burrito and it did not dissapoint. Delish I must say! The texture was so darn good. I deffinetly did not miss meat at all. Boyfriend got the Berry pancackes. Those we're the highlight of the brunch. So yummy. We sat out in the garden which has crazy good vibes. Check this place out: )"}
{"text":"I stopped by to check this out per recommendation of a new friend who's vegan/veg. It's always nice to go to a place where I know that there are things my son can eat. It's a rather large place, with a register in the very front, a long salad bar (think Whole Foods) in the middle, some tables and big, comfy booths. There's also a small dessert case and some books, snacks and supplements for purchase. All vegan.

Before stopping in, I checked out the menu so I was pretty sure of what we wanted- just a snack to share and a smoothie. We ordered the Cheese Fries and a large Berry Good smoothie. The portion was small. Extremely small, for $8. As was the $8 smoothie. I would have hated to see what the actual small smoothie size looked like.

We got 2 or 3 normal sized waffle fries and the rest were like the remnants in the bottom of the bag, which only took up 1/3 of a small salad plate. They weren't crispy. At all. In fact, and I even hate to say it, but they were soggy. The vegan cheese was melted (as much as it can be). It was like they put them in a microwave. I buy the Alexia waffle fries and the same vegan cheeses they have, and use them on a daily basis, so I know what's up.. My son, who's the fry king, didn't even want to eat them. That might not really mean anything to you, but that speaks volumes to me. He's legit a fry critic. If they are actually good, he'll wolf them down. But he doesn't like soggy fries. Sorry. The pico and guac were meh. It seemed like there wasn't anything on the plate that was made in house. But there were micro greens decorating the plate.

The smoothie was good. It's hard to mess up a smoothie though. But for $8, I can't believe at how small it was. I'm going to give them another shot because I do really want to like it and it's somewhere that can accommodate all of our families food allergies/intolerances."}
{"text":"Love this place ! It's right down the street from me so I come here a lot . The staff is always so nice and their food is always delicious ..... they also have a very relaxing outside area, which I could sit in for hours ... Go vegan cafe is a must try !"}
{"text":"High vibrational food. Aesthetically pleasing venue. This Cafe is keeping Las Vegas health conscious. I hope to see more of these places appear around the city. Raw burgers"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at GO VEGAN CAFE and it was awesome. I am from Southern California, vegan Mecca, and this place is up there with best. If you are a pretentious turd the quaint/cute atmosphere may not be up to your shitty standards but if not it is great. Staff is friendly and helpful, food is great, and there are vegan/gluten free desserts."}

{"text":"Place wasn't that great I ordered a grilled cheese and waffle fries with some brownies and it came out to 16 bucks. The grilled cheese was so small and they only gave me like 5 waffle fries. The brownies were okay. I got more bang for my buck at the bronze cafe. I got a big filling pita sandwhich with a side salad a Rice Krispies treat (vegan) and pita bread with hummus and a drink for only 22 bucks!"}
{"text":"I am Vegan and my bf is an Omni, we both LOVED this place! We happen to be on that side of town and I've been wanting to try Go Vegan Cafe. It was amazing! The staff is very friendly, helpful, and attentive. We ordered the BBQ Jackfruit sandwich, Chile Relleno, and two 
 pieces of chocolate cake! All of the food was delicious! The cake was chocolate filled with raspberry sauce, it was very decadent! I definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great food. I've been here several times now. Enjoyed the food! Cant's wait to go back and try the pancakes"}
{"text":"I'm still new at exploring vegan places, so I was really happy I could try this establishment with Tigra, my vegan muse and Happy Cow expert. 
We decided to order family style and ordered the following items:
Fruity Pancakes, The Loaf (Lentil Loaf), Tofu Scramble, Fried Avocados, and Sausage Links. 
Once we placed the order, I decided to also order a coffee drink. Our waitress was so sweet and offered to customize my drink with fresh coconut water, suggesting to include it in a blended beverage because I could not decide on what I wanted, I was struggling between a blended Mocha vs. Iced Coffee over Coconut Water.  The waitress said they could just add Coconut Water to my blended beverage, it'd be a little unconventional but they could do it. i was really happy with this suggestion but then one of the owners came up to our table discouraging my custom order. \"Why do you want coconut water in your blended drink\", he asked me rudely. I was a little puzzled, I just wanted to try something new, but didn't want to make a big deal out of it so I changed my order and I  simply ordered Iced Coffee over Coconut Water. The beverage was delicious, but I was put off by the fact that the owner had to come out and have a conversation with me. 
Our waitress also returned to say that they could not accommodate cooking 1 pancake. We had asked earlier since we were tasting a lot of different foods if this was OK, but again, one of the owners remained inflexible and basically said it's all or nothing. We begrudgingly ordered the full order of pancakes. 
Finally, the food itself arrived. It's no surprise that a lot of the items were hit or miss. The Fruity Pancakes were delicious and the Tofu Scramble, i couldn't even tell they weren't real eggs. I liked the Lentil Loaf, even though it was walking the line of moist and dry. The sauce tasted great on it. 
The bad? The sausage links were mealy and fell apart into pieces and the fried avocado wasn't even fried, just rolled around in a lot of spices. We finally confronted the other owner about our experience, and she was really understanding. Based on the food and how understanding the other owner was, I would still give this place 4 stars, they did a great job with the entrees, but with the other owner having that conversation with me, I must give it 3 stars. I've never had someone discourage me or my party from a custom order to the point where they have to personally talk to us about it...Hopefully, if you come here you will just have a positive experience with the food."}
{"text":"Strange environment.   A bit over priced and the lady with the dregs (white women) seems as if she is always medicated, very much lost in space. 
I went there 1 or 2 times and it was just not a good place for veganism, a lot of strange energy."}
{"text":"Mediterranean sampler- all was tasty. Falafel was a bit too fried, baba ganoush was not as creamy as I like. 

Raw mediterranean burger was great on raw seeds breads. 

Side of fries with cheese was awesome!

Eggplant parmasean burger was delicious! 

Greek wrap was amazing! Raw everything. So tasty! The blend of food choices was on point. 

It is on the pricey side so not sure if Ill return but the food was overall good!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. This place! I came in super hungry and so was a little impatient; but their quick service and delicious food took the edge off. I was a party of two for breakfast on a weekend late morning. 

Once I was fed, I noticed how clean and relaxing the space is. Great music. The servers are chill and the one at my table was kind and had a great presence. 

She suggested a coffee drink and it was everything she promised and more - with cashew milk. 

We had two tofu scrambles. They were beautifully prepared and presented and the portions were generous. Each one come with a muffin. Pretty sure it is gluten free. 

Finished with three nibs from behind their display case. Highly recommend. 

I go to workout classes in this building and live down the street - I will definitely be coming back to try the salad bar and other menu options. Thank you guys!!

My only criticism is on the pricing. I wish it were a little more affordable - but in their defense, everything is delicious and high quality."}
{"text":"Chris was such a good server!!!! We loved our food and the house salad and peach smoothie were certified bangers. 

Thank you for having such a large vegan menu  There is so much to choose from that it's hard to choose. 

Love the salad bar and huge selection of books, protein bars, etc and the prices aren't too bad from the off-menu things you can buy."}
{"text":"Great Vegan restaurant in the southwest area of the valley. I was impressed with how many different options they had on their menu paired with a create your own salad bar. Definitely one of the highlights is that fact that you can dine in the \"Garden\" which is a cozy patio filled with plants, art and a beautiful fountain."}
{"text":"Someone once said \"No one chooses to go to Denny's, they just end up there.\"  I somehow ended up at a restaurant serving raw vegan.  Hey!  They don't have to cook any of it!  This should come out quick! haaaaa

When I used to live in NYC, there was a semi well known \"Juice Bar\" on St Mark's for a while that was a front for selling illegal things.  Walking into this pretty empty space totally reminded me of that.  Aside from the salad bar in the center of the relatively big room, one would be hard pressed to tell if the restaurant was coming or going.  There was a sushi display case at the rear counter from probably like 4 businesses ago and a bar on the right that looked like it hadn't seen a patron in years.  With its basement type ambiance, Go Vegan Café is clearly a takeout type eatery.  I doubt a person that lives this type of lifestyle cares about any of that since a lack of vegan options in the neighborhood would totally supersede atmosphere.

The \"Raw Portobello Burger\" with its nut patty (made with almonds, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, ginger, & carrots) was better than expected.  The creaminess of the almond \"cheese\" and avocado made for a more than passable garden sandwich.  The onion rawtilla bun wasn't flimsy at all and held everything together nicely.  The \"fries\" were simply 3 slices of breaded avocado hmmmm. My wife liked her \"Veggie Wrap\" which was basically a reshaped salad as collard greens were used as the tortilla.  The house slaw that came with her dish with its unique dressing was the tastiest thing we had.  

Two dishes and veggie juice came out to $37, yet both of us were still hungry later.  Wanting to stay consistent with the whole raw evening, I ate a couple of bananas later on.  There's really no rush for me to return, but if I find myself on one of those beefx5 kind of weeks, this would be a good way to change up the eating cycle."}
{"text":"The classic vegan omelet was so good. Especially for Individuals who are new to the vegan life of eating definitely was awesome."}
{"text":"Best Salad Bar I've ever seen or tasted !! Most beautiful too !! I couldn't believe how much care was taken !! Everything we've had here was delicious .. veggies n \"Cheez\" sammich with fries .. nachos ... great stuff & also such a beautiful location !!"}
{"text":"One of the finest dining experiences I've had in a long time:  very friendly and knowledgeable wait staff; high quality ingredients; TRULY vegan (they really know what that means); and a great atmosphere and ambiance.  Also quite affordable when you take into account the quality and taste.  This place is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere deserves all 5 stars. The food deserves 4 stars (its good but I've tried better). The personnel is funny. My friend ordered durian smoothly one day and wanted to come back in a few days to get it again. She ordered the same smoothly and she was not given as mush as she was given the day before so she asked why. The guy said this is how it supposed to be and he doesn't have anymore. My friend went to the restroom and I stayed there watching the guy getting the smoothly leftovers out of the blender and putting it in a cup. I went to him and asked if I could buy it (the amount seemed just right for me) and he said \"no, it's for me\" and literally ran away drinking the smoothly quite unique experience lol"}
{"text":"Food was delioucious. Being from Los Angeles it's hard to find a good vegan restaurant anywhere else. This place is awesome. The dessert is so good."}
{"text":"Large menu full of very tasty sounding dishes. And, very few of them have soy in them, which is good for me (as I am allergic to soy) as well as people in general who are looking for something other than soy-based meat-substitute dishes that strike me more as gimmicks than serious dishes.

I had the spicy raw burger nut patty. Full of flavor, and filling--emphasis on filling; I came in pretty hungry and left completely filled up. The balance on the dish is also tremendous--no single flavor is overwhelming. The bun is a bit tough, so I ended up eating it separately; it's filled enough that picking it up and biting it is a bit inconvenient. 

They also have some desserts that look good, but I was too full to try one. The service was friendly and the person who took my order explained several dishes.

I'd definitely recommend it, to both herbivores and omnivores."}
{"text":"The nacho cheese tasted very lemony to me, but they have a great menu. I will be back. The pesto quesadilla was very good. My boyfriend said he would go vegan too if he could eat here everyday lol"}
{"text":"Heaven for vegans! And not just vegan food, they offer raw food as well and lots of fresh squeeze juices! It's pricey but good for your body so you're paying for quality. You can earn points and get free drinks, also vegas hot student gets 5% off! You must try Vegan Raw desserts they have it's soo goood!!!"}
{"text":"This place was sooo good! Vegan options without soy. I had the nachos and my husband had the burrito. I was very impressed and the staff was super nice ;)"}
{"text":"Yikes.   This is my first one star review.   I never like to do this and it's actually pretty hard to do because the employees here are very nice and welcoming. 

The reason for the low rating is based solely on the food.   My boyfriend said that if this was his first attempt at eating vegan he'd never ever try it again.

Nothing tastes good.   The only thing we found edible was the burger patty.   We started with the Mediterranean plate.   The hummus was dry and tasted like tuna.   The baba ganoush tasted horrific.   The falafel was dry and flavorless.  I ordered the jackfruit bbq sandwich.   The sopa was hard and dry and there was so much liquid that it squirted all over my hands, face, and shirt.  

All the plates came with pea shoots and an apple and orange slice.  There's no need for this.   The expensive plates should have something of substance like more of the meal we ordered.   My bfs burger came with like 10 fries.   The thing that actually made me mad about the fries was they it says they are baked but it's clear they are purchased and were fried previously. 

We also didn't like the fact that the cooks had to come out to the salad bar to get veggies and supplies to cook in the back.   This seems off to me and I did not like that.

This was definitely the worst vegan restaurant I've ever been too.   Definitely the worst restaurant I've been to in some time."}
{"text":"A nice place to enjoy raw and vegan food with friends and family. The menu had a wide variety of raw and vegan juices, meals and desserts, and the waiting staff was kind and welcoming. There's even a section for vegan and raw books. Conveniently next to True Rest Float Spa, a yoga studio and a beauty salon so you can do a whole day body pampering day and evening without leaving the area."}
{"text":"Thank you Lou for a wonderful meal! I love today's special of sweet potato nachos, they blew me away! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"For my first time, I tried to get a good variety of items from the raw and cooked menu, as well as a coffee. 

Pros: Tasty food.

Cons: Pretty pricey & they didn't fill the plate with as much food as I anticipated to get. I was still hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but just okay. Pretty bland, and service took a while. 
I ordered the classic breakfast burrito with sausage. It was probably the best thing we ordered. It comes close to a regular breakfast burrito in my opinion. We also got the classic burger, which was just okay. We got a side of waffle fries, in the box it comes with only a couple waffle fries, which was disappointing. Also, the burger had a lot of mustard, so unless you're a mustard fan, I would tell them to go easy. The third thing we ordered was a small batch of plain pancakes. The order came with three decent sized pancakes that were made fresh but completely flavorless, aside from a subtle hint of cinnamon. The syrup was a molasses or something of the sort. Would come back, but not somewhere I'd eat on the regular."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! We both had the Mexi Burger. The flavors were amazing! Ambiance was relaxing and peaceful. Crowds in and out throughout our time there. Fabulous staff. We also tried the oreo dessert and the strawberry cake. Both were very good and did not disappoint. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss I think on some items but worth the visit! I love the pizzas here and their cheesy things- like cheese fries and grilled cheese. But the more exotic things like jackfruit BBQ was too spicy for me and the lentil loaf was not our favorite. I love the coconut water here it's fresh out of the coconut which is the only way I like it not like the pasteurized stuff out of the container! The vanilla blended coffee is delicious as well."}
{"text":"I hate doing this to any business and I know how hard it is to staff in Las Vegas but I had an AWFUL experience. I feel horrible for the woman working there, they were clearly understaffed and she was running around like crazy but I waited 40 minutes for an order that still didn't come and I had to leave as I had an appointment elsewhere. Looks like it could be a great place, that one waitress was busting her back but you need to have help. I walked out and another customer had to go also. I never walked out of anywhere before the food was even delivered."}
{"text":"IN LOVE!!! From walking in the door the mood was right, we were welcomed and advised to sit where we liked. We sat in the garden. Staff was patient, thorough and helpful. Food was delicious and filling! We tried the loaded nachos and the pesto quesadilla! RIDICULOUS. This place just became my new favorite!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service ever. Don't bother going unless you want to wait an hour for your food, and even then we had to ask how much longer"}
{"text":"i eat here several times a week, before i tried it i refused to eat a meal without meat...but i love it, tastes better than meat and makes me feel amazing instead of groggy tired and bloated"}
