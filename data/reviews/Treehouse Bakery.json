{"text":"I found this place one day running errands and i'm glad i did.  I'm always looking for vegan baked goodies. They offer a wide variety of different flavors of cupcakes. Their prices are very good as well.  I had a birthday cake made for my friend and it was a special request and the owner did a great job following my request.  They display local artist work too. Neighborhood not that great but worth the goodies. The. Staff is very friendly and has great customer service skills."}
{"text":"I am so excited this is here! The treats are so good that you must have a try. If you are not far away from this place, I will envy you this point, because you can eat everyday! Owners are nice here, sometimes gave me a discount, thanks very much."}
{"text":"Cakes and Cupcakes that are vegan and delicious!! The are awesome and have come through at the last minute for me twice now (I forgot to order till way late and the still were able to save the day)!!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! Everything I've had is wonderful! I especially love the butterscotch cupcakes and the pop tarts. The scones are perfect too. Don't bother telling your carnivorous friends that it's vegan, they will never know the difference. And a bonus-they have great coffee too."}
{"text":"Their vanilla cupcakes are the best!  I also ordered my daughter's birthday cake here and it turned out delicious and beautiful.  They added pink glitter dust on the cake so it looked so cute."}
{"text":"I live in the Pacific Northwest, which is rich with vegan options when it comes to sweets.  Of all of the places I've explored up here, I've never come close to finding treats as mouthwatering as the ones from Treehouse Bakery!  And this definitely isn't one of those \"i'm vegan, so i've just forgotten what a cupcake really tastes like\" kind of deals.  I've fed them to non-vegans who always remark at how moist and perfect they are.  Everything they make is amazing!  Cookies, cupcakes, muffins, cakes, you name it.  My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it.  The Cherry Almond cookies are to die for, and I think I actually have dreams about the red velvet with cream cheese frosting cupcakes."}
{"text":"This is one of the best and cutest bakeries I've ever been too.  Everything that I've eaten from here has been absolutely delicious.  From cookies, to cupcakes, to pop tarts, I just keep going back for more...and its all vegan!  They also have some nice local art up on the walls.  The owners are very nice and friendly, you will enjoy coming here each time..."}
{"text":"I was searching for a vegan bakery to make some cupcakes for my fianc√©'s birthday last week. I found this great place one week ago which was 1 day before the bday. I ordered 2 of 4 different flavors. I am not vegan but have not stopped wanting another cherry vanilla cupcake. When I arrived they were packaged perfectly and the lady even told me how to store them so that they don't dry out. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a bowl game last month.  Came here and bought them out!  I got so many flavors I didn't know what they were.  Chocolate, peanut butter, raspberry...  wish I wrote down what was what.  Dried fruit scones as well  with very good flavor, but a bit purple from the blueberries :)  Whatever was left over when I got home is now in my freezer.  

Whatever flavor, they are moist and flavorful. I brought some into workand NO ONE could tell they were vegan. They even asked me if I was no longer vegan!

TIP: If you search on GoogleMaps, it shows the location as a house. The bakery is NOT the house, it is in the storefront to the left of the house, on the left of the liquor store.

Just wish we had a 100% vegan bakery here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today for some special vegan birthday treats. I got the lemon lavender cupcake, the chocolate cookie with sprinkles, and the brownie. I LOVED everything. The lemon lavender cupcake was one of the best cupcakes I've ever had and the brownie was SO soft and chocolaty. 100% going to go back!"}
{"text":"Love and go here often! Get there early in the day as inventory can be pretty limited later in the day."}
{"text":"WOOWOO!!!! This is the best!!! I have had health problems for three years and can't have gluten, dairy, eggs. I have not been able to find good desserts until now. My friend bought me a vegan, gluten free mocha chocolate cake. It was delicious! I ordered cupcakes which I will pick up at the public market."}
{"text":"Whenever I find a rockin vegan spot in the state of AZ, I take the time to get off my high horse and write a review. Mind you it's the beginning of the year and like everyone else I'm on the don't eat anything cleanse, mostly sweets.  Whilst driving minding my own business this little gem caught my eye and has been on my list for quite sometime. I decided to stop in and sure glad I did, the girls were super sweet. The sweets looked so delish and a little true to be real, so unreal I had to double check that I was in a vegan bake shop. I grabbed a brownie that didn't make it that far, it was light, moist, chocolatey and just a bit of crispy on the edges. All the great things that make up the perfect Tuesday treat. I definitely will be back if it's not for a afternoon pick-up, it will be definitely for my birthday cake."}
{"text":"I love Treehouse. Everything I have ever gotten there has been awesome. The women who run it are really friendly.
I am vegan and was so excited when I saw that a new vegan bakery in town. I have never been disappointed. I used to bake everything at home, but have pretty much given it up. It is not overpriced, as some vegan places can be. 

I love it here."}
{"text":"Best Vegan bakery in Phoenix! The staff is so kind and friendly to talk to. They are even willing to offer gluten free options if you call and ahead and give them some notice. Definitely my favorite sweet spot in Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!! I go to babycakes and other vegan bakeries in California and Treehouse Bakery is soooo much better than all of those. They have a wide variety of flavors and my fiance (who is not a vegan) even loves their stuff. They are even way better than non vegan cupcakes!! 

My favorite is the red velvet cupcake!! I HIGHLY recommend you try it!!!!"}
{"text":"I just went to their new shop downtown. I'm so glad it's only a block away from my work! 

I bought an oreo cupcake for myself and a french toast cupcake for my intern. We both thought they were AMAZING! The cookies look great too, and I can't wait to try the pie and coffee happy hour on Wednesdays!

Thank you treehouse bakery! I will be back."}
{"text":"I had them make my son's birthday cake. It turned out amazing. They are very friendly. I sampled a brownie and some cookies when I picked it up and they were some of the best I've had. Great business. I will have them make all of our cakes from now on."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim to feed my daughters sweet tooth.  She had the cookies and cream- even a day old, it was wonderful and moist!  I had the pear cardamom and it was a perfect combination of sweet and spicy!!"}
{"text":"I came upon Treehouse Bakery while looking for vegan baked good options in Phoenix back in August of 2010. Particularly I was looking for a place that could provide me with the convenience of ordering a custom good for a very special occasion.

I was able to communicate via email and setup my order, pickup date (9/28/10) and time - with an option to pay in advance or at pickup - without any issues or hassles. I ended up ordering a dozen carrot cake cupcakes (with vegan cream cheese frosting) and a dozen cranberry nut oatmeal cookies. 

The presentation of the cupcakes were great, and while I didn't get a chance to partake in them, I heard from my friend (he was the birthday boy and vegan) that they were absolutely delicious. 

I took home the cookies for myself and my husband. While my husband did not enjoy them as much as I did (he is not particular to the taste of flax or egg based substitutes), I was very thrilled with the texture and taste of the cookie. While they were a bit on the drier side when it comes to oatmeal cookies, the cookie was overall scrumptious, had a tasteful number of nuts and berries, and was both sweet and salty. 

I highly recommend that you try Treehouse Bakery! 

You can contact them via email - by phone or through their etsy website. They are also on facebook (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Phoenix-AZ/Treehouse-Bakery/101662863212327)  and I believe they are now offering orders for Holiday Pies!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had our wedding cake made at Treehouse Bakery.  We were very happy with the cake, the service, and the overall experience at Treehouse.  We visited the first time for a tasting and the experience was excellent.  We were able to taste four separate flavors that we were interested in since they were made into cupcakes for us.  The hardest part of the whole cake process was deciding on the flavor since they were all amazing.  The staff took the time to answer all of our questions and ensure we left with everything we wanted on our cake.  The price of the cake was also very reasonable.  When we went to pick it up for the wedding, it looked identical to what we both had in mind.  We loved the cake and so did our guests.  the best part...IT WAS VEGAN!!!!!  Love this place.  Highly, highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Bakery is conveniently located to my office. I head over whenever I need a some sweets in my life. Variety of items, I love the Gluten free macaroons... (I'm not gluten free) they're just so tasty! They've also been very accommodating for last minute orders. Staff is very friendly and always make really good suggestions.

I do have one recommendation ....The teas are very tasty but they should invest in bigger cups, at least for the iced drinks."}
{"text":"We bought more cupcakes from this baker at the Phoenix Farmer's Market. This time I purchased the Red Velvet Cupcake and it came with a moist crumb and flecks of real vanilla bean in the frosting. My boyfriend and I both loved these and they were a special treat for his Birthday."}
{"text":"I was craving vegan brownies, but couldn't seem to find any and then I found this place on Yelp!  

I grabbed a brownie and ate it while I was there, but before I left I got a couple of cookies and a blueberry scone. 

The scone I had for breakfast the next morning with my coffee and it was amazing!  Unfortunately, I don't live near this place, but I strongly considered driving another hour just to get there to get a whole bag of them."}
{"text":"I ordered my son's birthday cake here, it was amazing and he like it very much, the chocolate and cupcake are vegan,so it is more healthy.

Service here is also excellent ,I love this place ,I'll coming back I think."}
{"text":"Just started working in the area and I was super excited to find a vegan option so close! Quite possibly the BEST, softest sugar cookie my mouth has been blessed with. Can't wait to justify getting cookies every day before work."}
{"text":"Delicious deserts. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. It's rare when ask someone about products and is told in the most interesting and mouth watering way. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"it's so great to have a 100% vegan bakery in Phoenix! Everything I have tried here has been absolutely delicious and mouth-watering. I will return again and again!"}
{"text":"I ordered a vegan cake for a 40th Wedding anniversary. It was stunning! I will order from Treehouse Bakery again.
The cupcakes are also delicious. The cake part is moist and flavorful. The icing is not overly sweet. 
Lovely little gem this bakery is!"}
{"text":"Being a vegan, I have wanted to try Treehouse for some time and I had heard great things from those who had. I was in town one day and chose to make the drive. There is plenty of parking and it was easy to find. Prices are very reasonable, comparable or better than another of my favorite locations for vegan delights. They lost one star from me only due to minimal selection. I thing there were little more than a dozen options in the case. It being a small place, I can understand that. I chose 2 different flavors of scone and away I went. They were softer than I usually expect from a scone but good. The woman behind the counter was friendly and helpful. When I asked about a particular flavor that had been recommended to me, she indicated that availability changed a lot, even throughout the day, but that I was welcome to call in requests. The inside of the story is nothing fancy and not exactly inviting enough for one to want hang out for awhile, but my guess is most people are there for pick up anyway. I would go again and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"YAY VEGAN BAKERY!!
YAY customer service!!
Delicious and soft peanut butter/chocolate scone and pop tart!
Parking lot :)
YES returning. Obvi.

-The inside was small and there aren't many goods on display but unless you're trying to feed America from this bakery who the heck cares?? Support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"It was later in the afternoon, so no much of a selection to look at...a handful of assorted cookies, and brownies. That's it. I was disappointed as I specifically drove there based on Yelp reviews. I bought a brownie..and it was definitely good, but not extraordinary. I regretted not purchasing desert at The Coronado. I might try again, but for me, a stand alone bakery needs to always have a nice selection to offer.  Maybe it's supposed to be more of a \"custom order\" place..I might not have picked up on that."}
{"text":"This place does not look like much from the outside, let's be honest. Or from the inside, for that matter. In fact, if I didn't go there with someone that knew it was vegan, I wouldn't have been able to figure it out at first glance.....BUT, that being said...THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! 

The ladies working were genuine and funny. The cupcakes were so reasonably priced (i.e. amazingly cheap for vegan goods) that I ordered two and a \"poptart\". The french toast cupcake was just the right amount of sweet and had a distinct flavor. It didn't just taste like any other cupcake. My husband had the carrot cupcake a few hours later and loved the \"cream cheese\" frosting and walnuts. The portrait is still sitting in my fridge, but seriously, go here. 

It's amazing."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall didn't have much inside and had few choices. I was hoping for some fresh bread but all I saw was sweets. 

Behind the glass counter top were cupcakes so I decided to get one of everything they had (chocolate, chocolate chip, churro, grapefruit, mixed berry, red velvet and vanilla). I wish they had more variety.

The day old cupcakes were $1.25 and fresh were $2.50.
 
All the cupcakes were good, but not great. The flavors were simple and tasty but they were not as fluffy and cakie as I would have liked. Now that I've read reviews on yelp I've learned they are vegan! I had no clue when I ordered them. Considering the limitations of ingredients I think they did a good job but they are not as good as normal cupcakes."}
{"text":"Love love love Treehouse!! This is the only place I go and trust for my vegan delights :) you have to stop by and don't be alarmed by the term vegan because I have even my non-vegan friends hooked!"}
{"text":"We've ordered cupcakes from Treehouse on two occassions.  We've had lemon blueberry, vanilla, chocolate, and churro.  All were wonderful.  The mini cupcakes are the perfect bite.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decided to check it out. 4 stars for being a vegan spot. -1 for lack of gluten fee options. Brownies were pretty damn good. Selection was small. Would have gotten a cupcake but some had glitter and that scared me. If they do well enough they should open in a busier location and increase selection."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to this bakery today to try out some cupcakes. When we got there they had no cupcakes left because a customer that came in before us bought all the cupcakes that were available. Very unhappy with this! I would think for a smaller bakery that they would have larger orders to be placed in advance so that the rest of their customers can enjoy cup cakes throughout the day. To make one customer happy they decided to turn away future customers that wanted to try out a cupcake. Not a smart thing to do for a small business. We ended up having to take our cupcake needs somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had the brownie, super delicious! I also ordered the chocolate chip cookie it was good just not my favorite cookie even before I went vegan. The lady was super friendly and informative. Definitely will be back for treats."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the service. I showed up at noon on a weekday and the sign outside said closed. I called really quickly and they apologized for not turning around the sign and that they were open. I then came in, but not before this rude lady walked in front of me even though I was there first. She was then waited on FIRST and ordered all of the cupcakes. Literally all of the chocolate and vanilla. They didn't even apologize or offer me a discount or anything. I was only offered the old cupcakes from yesterday. Won't be returning. Big orders should have to be called in and reserved. I live over an hour away and was shafted."}
{"text":"I ordered chocolate chip cookies for a vegan friend's birthday. We set up a time and location to meet. I was there super early. Tick tock the clock kept ticking until I was almost late for class, so I left, pretty irritated.
 
I get a few blocks down and my phone rings - \"did you forget to pick up your cookies?\" 

Turns out she had forgotten to tell me to meet her *behind* the building which is where the entrance to the kitchen of the restaurant she bakes out of, is. So I was waiting out front, she was waiting in back, and we completely missed each other. Ah. So I drove like a madwoman back to get my cookies. You definitely dont want to be late to class when youre in nursing school.

They were nicely packaged, & I believe I paid cash. I hustled back to my car and made it to class with seconds to spare. My friend said she liked the cookies. I did try one and I thought they were just okay. Kind of the salty crispy variety of chocolate chip cookie rather than the soft chewy sweet decadent type. 

BUT I got to class on time, had a vegan present in hand for my vegan friend, AND said friend claimed to like them. No word on whether she actually did or not. But overall, mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Have alread posted a review but had to add that a friend at work ordered vegan chocolate cupcakes for my birthday and they were sooooooo delicious!! All my nonvegan coworkers LOVED them."}
{"text":"I'm about as far from vegan as you can get, but their cupcakes are delicious ... Service can be a bit leisurely, but be patient ... It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing iced toddy coffee!!! killer cupcakes! And they re vegan? I didn't know this until they were in my belly!"}
{"text":"First, I do not drop 5-star reviews unless I am blown away. One of my biggest peeves about Yelp is the low bar some people have for giving a PERFECT score after a only a visit or two. Small, friendly, good value -- day old cupcakes are cheap -- and vegan. I have bought whole pies, all kinds of cupcakes, tarts, all delicious. After becoming vegan I had to say goodbye to Barbs, but now I can satisfy my sweet tooth without the cruelty baggage. It takes real self control to not visit every day."}
{"text":"I needed some cookies made without eggs... My niece is allergic... So I ordered some sugar cookies with the frosting on the side, So she could decorate them at home... They were amazing! We also picked up a few other items and everything was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend treehouse bakery and I am looking forward to going back :-)"}
{"text":"I ordered cupcakes and a mini cake for my very small 'BBQ at home wedding reception' and they were AMAZING!!! 

Delivered on time, tasted amazing, looked amazing... LOVED them !!!! 

HAPPY customer (as I am allergic to milk & eggs) 
I can get yummy cupcakes that are VEGAN from a local small business (even better) !! 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We are so very happy we hired Treehouse Bakery to make our wedding cake! It turned out so beautifully- exactly as envisioned with our inspiration photos! And it tasted DELICIOUS. None of our guests knew that it was vegan. I have a dairy allergy and debated getting a separate small cake to cut for us- but after the tasting, we decided to use them for the entire cake and sheet cake and we were blown away by the amazing flavors they offer. We went with a 2 tiered/4 layered cake- one with cookies n cream cake, the other with chocolate cake- both with vanilla frosting. The execution was flawless- and I am excited to eat their desserts again!"}
{"text":"Second time coming in and both times were pleasant. Their employees are genuine and friendly. All down to earth with good vibes. My favorite pastry so far is the French Toast cupcake. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"The cupcakes can be hit-or-miss, but the custom cake I ordered was an absolute delight.  I got the cookies and cream cake as a special order for a birthday and it was delicious!  The second smallest size lasted us days and many large servings.  I will definitely be returning if I ever have more custom cake or cupcake orders."}
{"text":"You have to visit this bakery.  The sisters that own it are super friendly and make delicious treats.  Everyone that I have sent in there agrees with me. They made a root beer float cupcake that was so amazing. They are truly a part of the local community featuring local artists on their walls.

Do yourself a favor and make the trip, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, but this is my favorite spot for chocolate-chocolate cupcakes in the Valley. Rather than the dense, fudgy frosting you may find at places like OllieCake/Urban Cookies (which is fine--to each her own!), their chocolate frosting is more of a fluffy-creamy icing, which is way more up my alley. Their chocolate cake is moist and delicious as well.

Treehouse Bakery typically has special cupcake flavors too--I picked up a \"spicy hot chocolate\" one yesterday which was chocolate cake topped with a spicy cinnamon vanilla frosting. I've also seen cookies & scones but haven't tried them. The staff has also been very friendly every time I've stopped in, so I definitely recommend checking this out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Treehouse always has yummy cupcakes that are just the right size.  It's my chocolate fix rescue more often than not:)"}
{"text":"We were killing some time before attending an event downtown and happened upon this cute little shop.  They have a case of yummy goodies that beg to be eaten.  It's cute and clean inside and the staff were extremely friendly.  They do not have a huge selection but I don't find that to be a turn-off because it ups the chances that what you see is fresh.  I hope they stick around!"}
{"text":"It's a small and quaint shop which is extremely easy to find. Although it's a bit pricey they have discounted cupcakes as well that need to be sold that day and they were just as good as the ones not discounted. I purchased a lemon as well as a coconut cupcake which were both divine. 

Since they self-titled themselves as a \"bakery\" they should have a wider selection of sweets instead of mainly cupcakes. But regardless the cupcakes are scrumptious and no one will be able to tell they're vegan. ;)"}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to admit that I have lived within walking distance to this fine establishment for two years without knowing it existed. Better late than never I suppose. Super friendly and helpful staff, good selection of treats, plenty of parking too (which is a major plus in Phoenix), and most importantly the cupcakes I got were amazing. Took them back to my office and had some co-workers munch on them, no one assumed they were vegan which I think is a pretty solid commendation. Looking forward to trying some of the other options!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Corianne has been popular at the farmer's market for a long time and it's nice to see that support enable her to open up a brick and mortar location.  I especially love her creativity and willingness to use native and local ingredients.

Take a look at the reviews and see how far people are willing to drive for these goodies.  That says it all!"}
{"text":"Cupcakes so good you wouldn't know they were vegan. The owner was really nice too!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan but might get my baked items from this place from now until forever! Staff is super friendly and goes the extra mile. Recently bought a cake for my friend's 30th birthday who has a dairy allergy and was craving chocolate. The cake was the best I have had in years!!! It was so beautiful with rosettes and they even added edible glitter making it super magical. My go to from now on, this place is now one of my favorites in the valley. Keep it up ladies, you rock!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars with definite 5 star potential. The storefront is in an unassuming neighborhood, close to the state capitol. As a relatively new vegan, I am always excited to find vegan or vegan-friendly bakeries. The interior of the bakery is small, with a few tables, and I was initially disappointed by the limited number of baked goods in the display cases. However, I was on a mission and I forged ahead, selecting a triple ginger cookie, sugar cookie, strawberry \"pop tart,\" and a \"vintage,\" i.e. day-old, vanilla cupcake. All 4 were delicious and tasted like \"real,\" not vegan, baked goods. (How sad it is that most people will say this to express their delight with vegan pastries!) The strawberry pop tart's filling was lovely, not too sweet and not too tart and I especially liked the cupcake's frosting - amazing. 

Service was friendly and welcoming. Parking is to the right of the shop. I will come here again to sample some different goodies and eat some more of that frosting!"}
{"text":"First time here, and it was amazing! Came here just for the scones, and ended up buying two of each. All were delicious! The girls were very helpful, and prompt. Literally 5-10 minutes looking around, boxing my order and pay! Many other desserts, and other related foods here.

Must come, if your looking for a fresh bakery!"}
{"text":"Wanted a treat with my kids after going to the Science Center. Looked up near by bakeries and based on the reviews, thought I would give this place a try. I am so glad we did. 

I tried the Coconut Cupcake, my one son tried the Chocolate Cupcake, my daughter tried the Salted Caramel Cupcake, and my other son got the one he wanted, the Cookies n Cream Cupcake. We all loved them!!!

I tried a bite of everyone's and I also liked each of them. The chocolate one was nice and moist. The salted caramel was a good mix of flavors. I loved to coconut flavor in mine. 

I am sure I will be back to try the other items. The cookies and brownies looked tasty!!

Next time. :)"}
{"text":"Nothing new to report in terms of how awesome their everyday goodies are.  The cupcakes, scones, cookies, and pies are all still as ridiculously awesome as they were the first time I came here.  I'm actually writing to commend the ladies at Treehouse for coming through with an AMAZING cake.  A co-worker of mine has been battling breast cancer for months and the cancer is now finally in remission.  So much so that she was finally able to come back into work.  I had just two days before she came back to the office and wanted to get her something delicious so I called Treehouse with some ideas.  Admittedly I'm an idiot when it comes to cake designs so I largely trusted the gals at Treehouse to use their own creativity to help me out.  After we had a quick conversation we came up with a chocolate, peanut butter, and churro cake with cinnamon frosting.  The gals even came up with the idea of putting a fondant pink breast cancer ribbon as the center piece.  When I came by to pick it up two days later, I was thrilled with how beautiful it looked.  My co-worker cried twice.  Once when she saw it for the first time and another time when she had her first bite of it.  She was absolutely blown away with how delicious it was.  And yes folks, its 100% vegan (and both me and my co-worker are steadfast carnivores).  The women at Treehouse know exactly what they're doing and they came through with flying colors in the clutch.   Thank you Treehouse.  You absolutely made my co-workers return to the office a beautiful milestone."}
{"text":"Love this place! We ordered a birthday cake this week and it came out perfect! There were close to 100 flavors to choose from, and went the French toast cake+maple frosting. Holy Jesus Mary and Joseph it's amazing. I think the small can easily serve 8-10 with leftovers. The girls are a delight to work with as well, this is our place for special orders!"}
{"text":"Some people would say vegan desserts can't be moist or delicious, especially non vegans. Treehouse has defied this stereotype, hands down!!!! We tried multiple flavor combinations for our cake tasting ( lemon/ lavender, pear/ cardamom, strawberry/ basil, and the classic red velvet). I have to tell you all these flavor combinations were unique and absolutely delicious!!! What I loved most that none of the cakes or frostings were too sweet and each complimented the cake perfectly. 
The lemon was our favorite and ultimately the one we went with for our day. I will say that typically I am not a fan of red velvet, but this was the most moist and delicious red velvet cake I have ever tasted. I thank all the amazing staff and look forward to working with you on our big day!!"}
{"text":"Tried the funfetti sprinkle cake and it was delicious. The icing was just right and had a great flavor. Non vegans would never know the difference. This was my first visit, but I am looking forward to trying some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Vegan or not, you have to try the baked goods at Treehouse. They are delicious! I work in the area, so I decided to stop by a few days back and pick up a full flight of cookies (one of each they had), a poptart, a Twix-ish cupcake, and Blackberry Lemon cupcake. Every. Single. Thing. Was. AWESOME. Especially the poptart. I don't know how Treehouse makes vegan desserts taste as good (and in some cases better) than the non-vegan variety, but I am happy their wizardry exists in the neighborhood I work in. This is definitely my go-to spot for baked treats from now on. No matter your dietary preferences, you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place today and I am super pleased! I tried their brownie, poptart, and coconut macaroon and they were all perfectly delicious! I can't believe these treats are vegan!! Love love love and I can't wait to go back to try their other tasty delights!"}
{"text":"Easy to find and parking was simple.  The best part of the experience was the ladies working behind the counter.  They were helpful and friendly.  This is a very small bakery with a very small bakery selection.  We tried a berry donut, a cinnamon roll and a chocolate cupcake.  The cinnamon roll was okay, we didn't care for the donut but the cupcake was delicious.  The poptarts were much smaller than I was thinking so we didn't get one and the flavor of scones available didn't sound good so we skipped ordering that also."}
{"text":"I love this place :) It's delicious.. I love their freshly made scones, cinnamon rolls and their delicious coffee.. I love the staff here :) I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This bakery is a wonderful little place to satisfy a sweet tooth on any given day. They have all kinds of different cupcakes, treats, and non-alcoholic beverages. I bought the gluten free coconut macaroons, which was just the right texture and sweetness. 

All of their bakeries are vegan, and people looking for gluten free options can find cupcakes on Tuesdays. You can also call ahead for larger or special orders- the ladies are very understanding and helpful. 

There is a parking lot next to the bakery, but I personally found it a bit difficult to get to it because the bakery is located in downtown and it was hard to navigate with the traffic (to be fair, I'll also a bit direction illiterate, so you might not have trouble at all with parking). 

I would recommend this place for anyone that is seeking a good place for desserts, for satisfying their crave, buying a batch for coworkers early in the morning, or preparing for large parties such as birthdays. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"My go to bakery! Everything is so delicious, especially the brownies and really all the cakes and cupcakes. I had a berry fruit bar today and it was out of this world! Their sugar cookie is not sweet enough though, but great texture. A bonus is that this bakery is all vegan! I drive all the way out from Gilbert to go here and it is well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Cute little all vegan caf√©. Got the scone which was vey flavorsome for $4. We also got a small pop tart (for a $1.5 not worth it, legit bite size). I think they are pricey for what they offer. That being said the worker was very nice. They have a small indoor seating area. Did not see a bathroom. Free parking lot."}
{"text":"Wow what a cool find a small time bakery that does mainly special orders but has an ever changing array of sweets you can walk in and enjoy!

I tried their banana Choctaw scone, peanut butter & jelly with straw berry frosting cup cake and peanut butter chocolate.

Wow wow wow! The PB&J was so good!!!! I got coffee and enjoyed the scone and shared my pastries with my better half :)

Highly recommend this place everything is vegan which was new to me but everything tasted super good and the owners are incredibly friendly.

Check this place out !!"}
{"text":"I cannot recommend enough this amazing bakery.  After looking at a few other options for my vegan cake order for my wedding I had decided on using Treehouse because the flavors were so wonderful.  That was almost 3 years ago.  Fast forward to April, 2017 and my best friend was looking for a birthday cake for me.  She had been told that they keep cakes on hand for people who need them and unfortunately that was incorrect.  However, as she was on the phone at the last minute with the owner they were able to come up with a perfect flavor combination that my best friend was trying to secure for me.
Not only did they go above and beyond (when another local bakery took 3 days to even get back to her and tell her that they couldn't do a special order *cough* The Coronado *cough*) but they helped to make my birthday perfect with the most amazing cupcakes.  It was a special flavor that she was attempting to recreate and they did perfectly.  The cupcakes tasted amazing and I couldn't be happier with this bakery.  They will definitely be who I turn to for my special vegan baked treats."}
{"text":"Cute vegan bakery. The bakery goods was /is delicious. The scones were not sweet and quite a nice size. I also bought  cupcakes: chocolate , strawberry and vanilla, delicious even though the icing was a bit sweet for me. 
Overall, worth the trip for a vegan treat. The owner was engaging and very hospitable . Phoenix you have a great vegan bakery here."}
{"text":"I walked in, saw no one. 5 sec later a girl walked out the back. Of course she had to pause in amazement when she saw me, because I am an african/black women. Making it super awkward. She was overall nice but I couldn't help but feel that she was rushing me and could not wait for me to leave. I asked her if she had milk and she said no. After a silent pause of me staring at her wondering why she was lying she then listed 3-4 different types of milk she had. Then she went in the back to prepare it, now I am afraid to drink it. Her demeanor was not welcoming. I hate when white people do that pause, like they are trying to process the fact that you are not white. 
Anyways the food tasted like gassy medicine. But the quality was okay. I am still contemplating on drinking the milk..."}
{"text":"We came out of our way to try the bakery. We arrived at 5:15pm. The door was open but once we got inside a women looked puzzled and told us it was closed. We had even called before going and the voice mail said it was open until 6pm. The women cleaning said it was summer hours and they actually closed at 4pm. Even the hours on the front of the building said 6pm. Hours are not updated on the website either. Beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped by Treehouse Bakery last Saturday, while I was running around, and I'm so incredibly glad I did! 

Everything here is vegan and/or gluten free, and before you turn your nose up at vegan/gluten free baked goods, you need to try the stuff here! I picked up half a dozen cupcakes and a couple of brownies, and everything was a hit! In the shop they had cookies, brownies, cupcakes, coconut macaroons, and cakes.

I snagged a coconut cupcake for myself, and it was soft and moist and not super dense. The frosting was amazing! The individual who got the brownies said they were pretty fantastic. I also got strawberry lime cupcakes, vanilla cupcakes and chocolate cupcakes. None of them lasted very long. Every time I mentioned they were vegan, I got the same response, \"No way! Seriously?\" My partner, who is generally not a fan of anything vegetarian or vegan, ate 3 cupcakes on her own, even AFTER I told her they were vegan! 

Since I have a kid with an egg allergy, it's always tough finding things like cakes and cupcakes for birthdays and such, but now that I know how good Treehouse is I think I know where we'll be going in the future!"}
{"text":"The wedding cake was not only delicious but gorgeous as well!  These ladies are amazing!"}
{"text":"Treehouse is my favorite bakery in Phoenix! The staff that works there is very friendly, and the desserts are so delicious! Not to mention it is all vegan and the ingredients are very high quality. The cupcakes do NOT taste like food coloring and bleached flour, they taste super wholesome and natural and of course, made with love! The frosting is fantastic!!!!!!! I have never had such yummy frosting before! They make so many favors using their original frosting base and innovative cupcake flavors, it's never a boring trip to stop by Treehouse and see what's new!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I got a vanilla cupcake which was awesome! The store was cute and prices were reasonable. I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"So excited that Treehouse has now opened a store front! Now I can indulge in my cupcake urges almost instantaneously! I also love the decor in this place and the neon sign kicks up the coolness a notch for me."}
{"text":"I am so lucky that Treehouse is within walking distance to my home!! No matter the vegan slant on their yummy baked goods (I'm not a vegan), their cupcakes are fabulous! Somehow they've mastered a \"healthier\" cupcake. The coffee is fabulous and the staff is always helpful and smiling!"}
{"text":"Vanilla cupcake with vanilla frosting. Moist, good, not too sweet. Stock was low on a Sunday 10 minutes before closing but service was awesome. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Still as good as it was a year ago!!! Ordered brownies to take back home to Seattle and freeze! Also tried a margarita cupcake and a lemon cupcake...DELICIOUS!!! 

Non vegans would have no idea that those cupcakes and brownies are vegan!"}
{"text":"The best drip coffee I have ever had in Phoenix - I actually drink it black no sugar. I normally don't bother with drip coffee out - because I love my fresh ground Cartel coffee slowly filtered through my melitta at home too much.

Delightful pastries - which I can almost never say about egg and dairy free confections.

Alice in Wonderland stuff. Without the enhancements Lewis Carroll had."}
{"text":"The best scones I have ever had - vegan or not! Delicious cookies, mouthwatering cupcakes and great coffee! Just fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful pastries and reasonably priced. The atmosphere could use some work. Needs a new paint job and some new pasty counters. Otherwise a great alternative shop for vegans."}
{"text":"Delicious Vegan treats downtown. These are some of the best cupcakes I've had (vegan or not) ever. I picked up a dozen cupcakes for a family party, no wait at all. everybody loved them - especially the kids"}
{"text":"Me & my wife are new vegans trying everything we can get our hands on. Today we landed at this amazing bakery.  We tried a brownie, cupcake & a variety of cookies. I am so impressed with what we got. The staff was very friendly, we love supporting small businesses. We will be back and tell everyone about it."}
{"text":"I ordered my daughter's 1st birthday cake from here. Yes, that's a VERY IMPORTANT cake! I went off the reviews and wow, I'm glad that I did!

Location is downtown Phoenix in an older neighborhood that is getting revitalized. 

Customer service is outstanding and the cake was gorgeous. It was decadent,  beautiful and a hit at the party. The cupcakes were so moist and delicious. There wasn't one left after the party. 

The owners are great! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! We tried many kinds of cupcakes, scones, cookies- everything was some of the best I've ever had. The staff is really friendly as well and remembered us even though we'd only been there once before. I would go out of my way to come back here again! The drinks- tea and coffee, are also exceptionally good and everything is also really reasonably priced. Wish I could give 100 stars instead of 5!"}
{"text":"Raw vegan cheesecake anyone? Had the gals here make a raw vegan blueberry cheesecake for my birthday. It was delectably rich and amazingly good. Who knew cashews could taste so amazing?!!

They've now made birthday cakes four times for us (this was the first raw one) and I highly recommend them for vegan birthday cakes! Delicious!

And their daily selections just keeps getting better...pop tarts and scones along with the cupcakes, cookies, and brownies. Tuesdays they have gluten-free cupcakes (altho' they have GF macaroons every day). They've also had a few mini-pies lately too! Check facebook for their selection of the day!

(Oh, they've just installed a bike rack outside) (And they display art from local artists, changes every month or so.)"}
{"text":"I LOVE their gluten free cupcakes! SO yummy!"}
{"text":"I moved down the street recently and have been coming here a lot. Not only are the cupcakes delicious but the ladies are very friendly. I am not vegan but I come here a few times a week because it is so close and yummy. I even think I like their baked goods more than most non-vegan baked goods!"}
{"text":"Treehouse Bakery is the best all-around vegan bakery in the greater Phoenix area. I've been buying vegan cupcakes from Treehouse since before they even had a storefront. They are great for a quick sugar high, event cakes or even cookie boxes for clients. Despite being a chocolate lover, I like their simple vanilla cupcake the best. It doesn't try too hard, it is just a delicious, moist little cake with the perfect amount of frosting. The pop tarts are probably my next favorite item, followed by the brownies, the Meyer lemon cookies, the sprinkle cookies, the scones and then everything else. I've never had anything bad here. It's always a hard choice so I buy too much! But another plus is that the costs are reasonable, especially compared to other vegan bakeries. I love bringing a tray full of their treats to meetings, and then seeing the reaction when I tell people gobbling them down that they're 100% vegan.

The services is also great - friendly and efficient. And they are excellent business members of the vegan community in Phoenix. For example, they hosted struggling vegan Mexican food chefs for Sunday brunch events until they could get their truck back on the street (and still frequently hold brunch events in the parking lot)."}
{"text":"I was absolutely thrilled with the custom vulva cupcakes I ordered from Treehouse Bakery!! Amanda, the artist, thoughtfully created every vulva cupcake to be unique and beautiful! I asked her to create vulvas representing a range of diverse colors, so all ethnicities were represented, and she did just that!  They were a huge hit with my sex therapist colleagues from AASECT.org!  Not only did they look fabulous, they tasted delicious too!! Thank you so much for doing such an exceptional job!! I highly recommend Treehouse!! Thank You!"}
{"text":"I love their banana bread cake! I will be using them again. They were very helpful and patient with me."}
{"text":"Absolutely DE-LISH!!!!   I was throwing a bridal shower for my vegan cousin-in-law, and luckily found this wonderful bakery.  I sampled the cupcakes a few weeks before the event and fell in love with these great cupcakes.  My fave - and the HIT of the shower - were the Boston Cream cupcakes.  I will definitely be back.  The owners are wonderfully kind and deserve support of the community.  I have told, and will continue to tell, everyone I know about this place."}
{"text":"I feel bad leaving this review, but it is the truth.  I ordered 120 cupcakes for a baby shower, and while they looked very cute and the service I got was really great, the cupcakes were not good in taste.  I think vegans are just self promoting with all of these great reviews.  The truth is that these cupcakes taste like frosted muffins.  And everyone I talked to agreed with that.  The \"cake\" and the \"frosting\" are both very dense (although the frosting is still pretty darn good.)  The cake is not especially good and is not worth $2.50 each (when buying in bulk.)  I used to be a vegan and cooked all sorts of cupcakes from the book \"vegan cupcakes take over the world\" that were delicious!  And this bakery can't even compete with my homemade vegan cupcakes.  I just expected more.  I only tried 4 flavors so maybe they were the wrong ones.... but I doubt it."}
{"text":"Good treats, nice staff and responsive owners. Yummy all up in my tummy especially when the owner looks like a Bunny, for real. Any who, thanks."}
{"text":"Everything we've had has always been delicious.  Vegan desserts at it's best.  The cakes are moist and full of flavor and the icing I can probably eat by the tub full.  I'm so happy we found this bakery.

The selections are limited, but that's because they really focus on quality, rather than quantity.  We have been lucky every time we go.  The salted caramel cupcake is my favorite, normally I find this combo salty but here the caramel was perfectly salted and I wanted to eat more.  The kids loved the other cupcakes and brownie and one time I got to have an apple pie.  LUCKY!    They also offer coffee, but haven't had that yet."}
{"text":"I needed a birthday cake for my mother, who has some dietary restrictions. Usually you can find a place that is vegan OR gluten-free, but not both. I found Treehouse on Google and was so happy to find that you could request certain flavors be gluten-free as well as vegan and they had lemon lavender, which was right up my mum's alley. I called and ordered the cake and Amanda helped me come up with the crossword design I wanted after looking at cakes they had on their website. I came in to pick up the cake and it was perfect! We didn't need a large cake so they couldn't fit \"sixtieth\" on the cake but made it work for the size of the cake I ordered. We cut the cake at dinner and it tasted SO good - not only did my mother love it, but my boyfriend, brother and I did as well and we do not normally go vegan/GF. I was so happy to find something she could eat that tasted so delicious. The girls were so nice and helpful when I came in to pick up the cake and I also got a couple vegan pumpkin cupcakes, which were so good. Thank you Treehouse for helping make my mum's birthday that much better with your delicious cake!"}
{"text":"I bought some of their goodies at the Phoenix Public Market.  I got a cinnamon roll, red velvet cupcake, and chocolate chip cookie.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  No one would be able to tell they are made without eggs or milk.  

The packaging was super cute too.  The cinnamon roll came in a mini pink baker's box.  The cupcake had it's own special box too, with a cute smiling cupcake stamped on the front.

The pricing was very fair for fresh baked goods too.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here. This place is amazing. The staff, owners, are so sweet. They will make anything for you and put aside and make certain sweets they know you would love!  They actually get excited to have you try their new flavors !! They are also open to hearing and then baking any of your ideas for their famous scones or cupcakes!  Even though this is \" Vegan \" trust me when I say, it beats any bakery out there!!!  I wasn't Vegan my whole life, and had I came to this place without being Vegan, I still would be a regular ! Our daughter is 10 and isnt vegan and this is her favorite place to go to on the weekends !!! Try it one time, and you are hooked ! I hope this place prospers and sticks around for a long time ."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in it smelled amazing. Right away I was greeted with a hello and a smile. I decided to order one of each cupcake they had as well as some homemade pop tarts. I have to tell you although the selection was small they were very good. It was very hot in my car due to the great Arizona heat so a few of the frosting tops began to melt before I got them home, but even then they all tasted great. My favorite had to be the pop tarts, then the chocolate and Churro cupcakes a close second and third. Cute little shop."}
{"text":"When we get to be in Phoenix (which isn't often) we do everything in our power to hit up this bakery 
The staff is wonderful, the treats are devine and we never leave empty handed!
Thank you girls for always providing the very best vegan delights to the masses!!!"}
{"text":"Still a local favorite of ours! Last October we had the pleasure of having Treehouse Bakery provide us with a beautiful wedding cake. We chose to have the flavor be pink champagne, my favorite of theirs! I wanted a super simple, plain white buttercream cake, and they made my dreams come true! Thanks Treehouse!"}
{"text":"A must for a vegan who wants some sweets or even if your not vegan the cupcakes and everything else I tried are just great."}
{"text":"I like cupcakes. I like them... a lot. Ok... I love cupcakes. 

They say the first step to dealing with an addiction is to admit you have one. I don't have an addiction to cupcakes. (I'm in the denial phase). 

I just moved to Phoenix from Florida. It took 3 days to drive here. I arrived Tuesday, and the rest of the week has been unpacking and organizing. 

I was out and about today and saw Treehouse Bakery come up in the Nearby Feed on the Yelp app. All I saw was, 5 star - Bakery - Picture of cupcakes. After the long week I've had, all I could think was that this was the place I needed to be... STAT.

I ordered a 6 pack from the very friendly young ladies that were running the bakery. I got home a little while later and couldn't wait for that feeling of euphoric cupcake bliss. I snatched one of the little baked treats from the box and took a bite. 

After that bite I just kind of stood there in my kitchen for a minute... confused. I didn't like the cupcake, at all. Maybe I got a bad one. I put that one down and picked up another. Took a bite. The same feeling of dissatisfaction ran through me. 

WHY?! Why have the cupcake God's forsaken me!? This is all I could think. 
I have had some great cupcakes in my day. I dare say I have had one of the best cupcakes in the Southeast. So is this 5 star cupcake the best the Southwest has to offer?

Frustrated, I went on my computer and pulled up Yelp. What the f*ck is going on here? After sitting there and reading the reviews for Treehouse Bakery, the issue I was having with the cupcakes became quite apparent...

The cupcakes are VEGAN!

I feel slightly foolish. I was so ready to slap down a 2 star review. I'm upping it to 3 star since the staff was sweet, the presentation of the cupcakes was nice, and I really had no business eating these cupcakes since I have no idea how a vegan cupcake should taste.

 I respect the vegan lifestyle, but these cupcakes are not for me."}
{"text":"Ordered a birthday cake for my son. He absolutely loved it. My guest were blown away with how good the cake was and it was vegan they couldn't believe it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and friendly owner!  My wife is a vegan and this is the only place I trust to make her birthday cake.  The owner is really invested in making food that everyone will enjoy.  Salted caramel cupcakes are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love love love this sweet spot,  such a wonderful business for the Grand Avenue Area.... The vegan brownies and pop tarts are EVERYTHING!!"}
{"text":"Yay, Treehouse finally has a home!  I've been stalking them at the markets for months and was super excited to learn that they were going to have a store front.  

I had a large order of cupcakes for an event and the owner was very helpful with picking out flavors, colors, and exactly how many to order (We even kept the fact that they were vegan a secret as to not sway anyone's opinions before tasting).  No one could tell the difference and all were gobbled up!!"}
{"text":"I just love this little neighborhood gem!

I've purchased cupcakes, cookies, cakes, and even a pie from Treehouse Bakery. Mostly recently it was a birthday cake for my Grams' 95th - she and my family were just thrilled because it was so cute, so personalized, and so yummy!

They do a great job at reasonable prices. Plus, it's good to support a local business. I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"These were good cupcakes.  Not \"good for a vegan cupcake,\" just good! I tried the SALTED CARAMEL and the BANANA. My boyfriend had the FRENCH TOAST. I liked the BANANA best (4 stars). Strong banana flavor and a nice balance with the vanilla frosting. It was slightly over-baked and needed a bit more moistness going on, but still very scrumptious. The SALTED CARAMEL (3 stars) I also enjoyed. However, they way over did it with the sugar/sweetness. It was hard to enjoy the last couple bites because the sugar was off the charts high. I don't think the \"salted\" part came into the equation enough. I still enjoyed the favors, and the middle had a syrupy center which was delightful! My boyfriend enjoyed the FRENCH TOAST cupcake (4 stars). But, again, overly-sweet. He could not finish it. I tasted a bite and agreed they need to tone it down. It makes it hard to get the \"French toast-y\" flavor when it's too sweet. I'd definitely try these again and would recommend it to friends! I'd make this a 3.5 star review but the ladies were very sweet and friendly! Cupcakes are on the pricier side at 2.50 a piece."}
{"text":"I needed a vegan bakery to make my sons first birthday smash cake and cupcakes and I was referred to Treehouse. First off I was beyond excited to find an all vegan bakery that had so many options and all types of stuff! They did an amazing job with his smash cake and everyone absolutely loved the cupcakes at his birthday! Everyone who works here is so awesome and friendly. Definitely my go to bakery in town for any even or just for some delicious sweets!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was not impressed, walked in on a Sunday, wasn't greeted by anyone, didn't even know if they were open, no selection to choose from. No thanks."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cakes are beautiful and taste delicious! Staff is friendly and are very detail orientated! Reasonably priced too. We love this place. Ordered 2 cakes so far and we'll definitely be back for our next one :)"}
{"text":"This bakery is beautiful... She is truly a gifted baker!!! I have tough requirements -- gluten-free AND vegan!

My husband ordered cupcakes from here for my birthday this year, and they were moist and practically melted in my mouth. I loved the red velvet but definitely fell in passionate love with the regular chocolate cupcakes. It was my birthday, so I quickly shoved 4 down my gullet. What? Calories do not count on your birth anniversary, I'm a dietetic student. It's true.

As I fell into a taste trance, I quickly realized that the cupcakes I had been getting at Nami are sad and pathetic... and overpriced. I noticed at Treehouse, day-old goods are reduced in price. This is never the case at nami. It all tastes overly refrigerated and sometimes tofu-like. I don't know about you, but I dislike tasting tofu in my frosting.

I have a bit of a princess-like palate, but I have a right to be as picky as anyone else. Truly, if you need gluten-free or vegan cupcakes, these are better than any cupcake I have had, vegan, gluten-free, or otherwise."}
{"text":"Yum! I just tried the day-old raspberry swirl cupcake (only $1.25 as opposed to $2.50 for the day-old, still perfectly delicious and fresh cupcakes) and the strawberry chocolate chip scone - both DELISH."}
{"text":"I wanted to write a review, but wanted to wait until our first anniversary. 
I have heard that a good wedding cake will still be good after the first year. 
I have had friends that had wedding cakes sealed and after a year said it tasted horrible.
Our wedding cake wasn't only beautiful and delicious, but we ate it on our first anniversary and it tasted as fresh as it was when delivered!!
I will always recommend this place and will have my loyalty if I ever need baked goods. Thank you for making both days special!"}
{"text":"It sure is tough to be vegan and get good pastries! My sister surprised me for my bridal shower and brought a dozen mixed cupcakes from Treehouse. I was hooked! 

Today I dove into a 9\" double layer chocolate-chocolate cake that Treehouse made for my wife's birthday. The cake was perfect and delicious - it truly could've passed for a 'regular' cake. 

My transaction with Treehouse was delightful from start to finish. Placing the order was easy - they require 1/2 down, but that's no big deal. They have a cool location with easy access and easy hours. Plus, the girls are cool. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just an update! 
Still love this place. I need to visit more often. 
But, they did make my daughters very first birthday cake!!!!! It was so yummy and she absolutely loved it. 
I didn't want a sugar filled cake for my daughter as I don't think a 1 year old needs to eat that much sugar. They listened to all my concerns and made such an amazing, customized, delicious cake for her! 
Completely satisfied customers of Treehouse Bakery and their delicious treats!!"}
{"text":"Located on Grand Ave in the Arts & Small Business District, Treehouse has taken an old storefront and converted it into their own little bakery.  This area of Phoenix has a worn out old-time feel that is really making it's way through revitalization, which is something I love to see.

We were welcomed with an abundance of tasty treats to choose from.  Not only do they have your basic vanilla or chocolate cupcakes, but they always have treats with their own special twist. Margarita, rocky road, chocolate chip, churro, or strawberry champagne cupcakes anyone? The list really is never ending.  In addition, they also have freshly baked cookies, coffee cake, donuts, homemade pop tarts, and cinnamon rolls.  ALL VEGAN! (P.S. They have gluten-free options too!)

Honestly, it was so hard to choose that I went with several options....and none disappointed.

Something I've come to expect and accept is that when you find vegan delicacies chances are you'll be paying a premium.  That's not the case with Treehouse.  I was able to get everything I ordered for the price I've paid for one baked good at another one of my favorite vegan locations in Phoenix.  Not bashing, just keeping it real."}
{"text":"I visit here too often. Everything is good. Saturday cinnamon roll is the BEST...no...the brownies are the best...see I really can't decide. Cookies are really good both peanut butter and chocolate chip. Ladies are very sweet and helpful. The only thing I ever tried that I didn't absolutely love was the mini apple pies but every thing else please try. Its not super cheap but worth it vegan and some gluten free items. I will keep going it's part of my life."}
{"text":"About 6 kinds of cookies, 5 cupcakes, brownies scones too. Woman on phone for directions and lady who served me were very nice. Big parking lot too."}
{"text":"One day back in Jan. 2015 my husband brought me home a Pumpkin Cupcake from Tree House.  That was it - I became hooked. Ive gone on my own a few times since and brought some cupcakes to my step kids. They loved them and had no idea they were vegan cupcakes until only after. I think it really did not matter to them at all only cuz they said \" Those was the best ever \". The staff there are so friendly and nice. I am hooked on this place. Really enjoy the staff and really enjoy this place. In fact I mentioned for my bday next year he can just order my bday cake here. Tree House Bakery is AWESOME ...."}
{"text":"Have not been disappointed by this stylish vegan bakery. Everything I've had: scones, pie, cookies, pop tarts, and cupcakes have all been excellent. My all time favorite has to be the French toast cupcakes. The rich creams and doughs have completely changed my perspective as to what is possible in vegan cooking. The prices are also very reasonable here, and the selection always changes up. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pass by here a few times a week, but today I finally stopped in. I got a peach pop tart, which was sooooo good! Also got an apple spice scone. It was good, but the pop tart was better. They have a lot of variety, and the employees were super nice and friendly. 
Definitely coming here again and trying the rest of their pastries."}
{"text":"Amazing. Ordered a smash cake for my son. The design was exactly what I wanted and it tasted fabulous also. Thank you treehouse bakery!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, but the cupcakes personally were too dry for me. I expected more freshness, based on the positive feedback of this bakery. Price was reasonable, but will have to try something else on my next visit. More selection would make this place a little better."}
{"text":"I ordered a Deadpool birthday cake from them at the end of last month. We picked it up on the 4th of July and I hid it from my boyfriend (it was for his b-day!) for over 24 hours. The cake was cute! I got it french toast flavored, and it was incredibly moist and absolutely delicious. Even his family (who are not vegan) enjoyed it. It is a week later, and we're still eating it and it's still yummy!!! Thank you for making me the perfect vegan cake. It was a huge hit with my boyfriend. Definitely worth every cent!"}
{"text":"Awesome vegan treats here!
(I especially love the carrot-cake cup cakes)

It's pretty cool how they showcase artwork by local artists too.

They just made me two carrot cake birthday cakes and EVERYONE I turned them on to LOVED them! 

Even my friends who have never tried anything like it thought they were fantastic!

Words cannot describe how delish they were!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find out that there was a vegan bakery in town! Upon pulling up to the parking lot, I began to question my decision. The inside selection was minimal, but I was able to custom order a peanut butter cake w/ chocolate frosting for my girlfriend's birthday. They were also willing to draw on a beautiful mandala design on said cake. Initially, I wasn't sure about the size of the 6in cake, but we got a good 12 pieces out of it. Cake was definitely dense, but moist. The icing also offset the denseness a bit. I feel that Phoenix has a smaller community of local vegan, so I'm pleased that Treehouse Bakery exists. With friendly and accommodating staff and deliciousness all around, I'll definitely be back and recommending to friends."}
{"text":"First time here and it was wonderful! It's a curse and a blessing that it is so far away or else I would be there every day!"}
{"text":"Thank you ladies for making the cutest mini cupcakes! I appreciate so much your willingness to bake the batch special for me the same day! So tasty, it was definitely a hit at the party!"}
{"text":"While Treehouse has super tasty desserts, they have inconsistent service. Sometimes they close when they feel like it and the manager is never available and does not return phone calls. They did my graduation cake in 2015 and while it tasted great, they were hours late and I couldn't help but feel like they forgot to decorate my cake and just threw some fondant on there in the final hours. If you can overlook the service, you're in for a treat, but if you truly value customer service you may want to head elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am hooked on Treehouse Bakery! A few co-workers introduced me to this quaint, little bakery that is easily accessible. The inside is adorable and proudly displays local art and other Mom & Pop shops. 
Do not be discouraged by the vegan focus here people! The cupcakes are wonderful and filled with love. The owners are very friendly and proud of their product. As they should be: talk about delicious! My favorites: churro, banana foster and a latte-flavored indulgence. 
Try this place!! You'll come back again and again!"}
{"text":"So delicious! I love the salted caramel cupcake! To die for!!!!!!!! I love that it's ALL vegan!! I feel like it's all made just for me! Hehehe!! :)"}
{"text":"There's only one bakery I'd trust with my birthday cake! Coconut cake with Vanilla icing - delicious and easily the best cake I've had in my life. I've also gone other times for various desserts and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Flavors are a-m-a-z-i-n-g! Better than most non-vegan bakeries! The coffee is very good, too."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I'm NOT a vegan.I'm the exact opposite actually, if it was born, I eat it. :) BUT, one of my coworkers is a vegan and I dropped by this little shop hoping to get her a cupcake..

1. The shop itself is adorable. I love the painting they've done and it's all very clean and minimalist while still being charming. 

2. The service was very warm and friendly. Not the typical vegan hipster elitist type you find often in DoPho. 

3. I got my coworker a red velvet cupcake, and because they're my favorite I got myself one too, just to try out. Because they're vegan I didn't expect to be wowed at all.. I was so wrong! The cupcake was delicious. Very flavorful and pretty true to form for a traditional red velvet cupcake. My coworker hasn't had hers yet, but I'm sure she'll love it. 

All in all this place gets 5 stars because of the adorable atmosphere, friendly service, and most importantly; they've mastered a vegan cupcake that tastes delicious instead of disgusting!

Kudos Treehouse Bakery!"}
{"text":"If you say you are open till 6 and you close at 415 w someone mopping inside who ignores multiple people coming up to the locked door confused...then you just suck"}
{"text":"Word can not explain how thankful I am to Treehouse Bakery for making my moms birthday one to remember as she embarks on her journey in veganism. Not only did Treehouse Bakery provide excellent customer service to me by explaining their product and the process throughly but the finished cake looked and tasted absolutely amazing! I am very grateful and I'll be looking to them for future events. Thank you soooooo much Treehouse Team!"}
{"text":"Just found out to my sad disappointment after a conversation with the owners of Treehouse Bakery, that they are not vegan...not even vegetarian. And because I rate businesses not only on the quality of the food/product, but also on customer service, company philosophies and ethics, I changed my review to one star."}
{"text":"I love this bakery! I was so excited to find a cheap bakery. They have a lot of different pastries. Also, the employees are very nice and helpful. I order a cake, and it was delicious and very filling. Even my non-vegan friends did not know that the cake was vegan. I certainly recommend this bakery."}
{"text":"Wow.. Just went to a gathering for a birthday and had a truly amazing vegan chocolate cake created by TreeHouse. Moist and fluffy with great chocolate flavor. Icing was chocolate and tasty too."}
{"text":"We visited for the 1st time today and absolutely loved the cupcakes and brownie we purchased. We purchased a dozen cupcakes to try different flavors(vanilla, chocolate, peanut butter, mint chocolate, and an almond flavor).

We've eaten at many places over the years that sell vegan desserts throughout the country and we both agreed the cupcakes were the best we've ever had. We could tell high quality ingredients are used and of course the recipe's result in a fantastic tasting cupcake. The brownie was also amazing, taste and texture wise.

Staff was very friendly and helpful. 

Put this one on your list.....highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Got 18 cupcakes for my birthday party and the person I spoke with was super helpful and friendly! She explained to me my options and worked with me to get my order just right. When I had a family member pick up the cupcakes the day of the party he was running about an hour late and, even though the bakery had already closed for the day the owner stayed late just so we would be able to have our cupcakes -excellent customer service! 

I quite enjoyed the lemon cupcakes! Couldn't believe that they were vegan but they are! The only reason I knocked off a star was because some of my guests said the cupcakes were a little dry but overall I was very pleased with Treehouse Bakery and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My gosh do they know how to make a killer vegan cupcake!! They are so moist and the best cupcakes I've ever had. My fianc√© even loved them and we craved them the whole trip and he hates every vegan dessert that we've tried. Every one has to try this place weather your vegan or not, be aware though, you will become addicted!"}
{"text":"Ok so, I'm not a crazy dessert person, but I love food. However when approached with tasty treats only to find out that they were Vegan, lets just say I was a bit skeptical. I mean I'm not Vegan, I'm not going to pretend that I understand Vegans either, I like meat and stuff that taste good. This of course is all coming from the random thought that everything Vegan is yuck. Trying Treehouse was like getting slapped in the face as a kid, being told not to make fun of the ginger, because well.. he can't help it. In other words all of my misconception of Vegans eating this gross alien food went straight out of the window. I mean damn you people actually do have taste buds. I've actually come to the conclusion that I like Treehouse's vegan peanut butter cookies better than regular ones. Not to mention the non-cheesecake, this one was a mountain for me let me tell you. Thinking gross gross gross, how can you have no dairy in CHEESECAKE!? Well as my other eye opening taste-bud-tacular experience, the non-cheesecake hit a home run by the first bite, second, third.... damn it I ate the whole thing. Anywho you get my point. As a non Vegan, meat eating, cheese loving, son of a bitch, I fully recommend you try Treehouse bakery, because damn that shit is good!"}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for vegan pastries/desserts and stumbled upon Treehouse Bakery on Yelp. I jumped in my car with hopes of finding some delicious treats there. The employee that greeted me was very nice. She was bringing out fresh brownies and scones. I decided to go with a scone, I believe it was cashew almond or vanilla cashew. Whatever it was, it was damn good! It was my favourite of all the things I got. I also got a vanilla latte \"vintage\" (aka day old) cupcake, coconut cupcake, a man cookie, and a triple ginger cookie. The triple ginger cookie was right up there with the scone! The other items were good too, but they just weren't as good.

It's a good thing I don't live really close, because I would be there all the time. I will occasionally make the trip to get some goodies. I even took one of their cute, little buttons."}
{"text":"This review is a couple weeks late but 1st chance I've had. Where do I start(?).... ugh! I was sad that I had to choose only 1 thing because everything looked amazing & smelled so good! After long thought I chose the blueberry lemon scone. It was AMAZING!, full of flavor, nice bite the outside of a super soft inside. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Treehouse is half an hour from my house. I can get vegan pie, cupcakes, cookies, and pretty much everything else Treehouse offers, from places considerably less than half an hour from my house. The thing is, I no longer want vegan pie, cupcakes, cookies, or pretty much anything else from anywhere except Treehouse.

After walking in to find candy-striped pink walls, shiny white tables decorated with pink flowers in glass vases, and white counter tops with glass casing home to all sorts of baked goods, my hopes were high. Who doesn't love Earth Balance and good design coexisting harmoniously? 

First we tried a day-old s'mores cupcake, which is half the price of a regular cake and 90% as good. The cake was rich and chocolatey, just like the frosting. There wasn't much of a graham crust on the bottom, though, so it was more like a double chocolate cupcake. Not that I'm complaining. The only thing that didn't taste fresh was the marshmallow on top, but it was still a total steal for $1.25. 

But, what's better than a good deal? Answer: when a store owner says, \"Would you guys mind being guinea pigs?\" and motions to a fresh batch of thumbprint cookies. Wait.... FREE COOKIES? No, we don't mind at all, kind lady. We each tried a buttery, chewy cookie with a berry in the center who's name escapes me, but is apparently related to the ground cherry. 'Twas mighty tasty.

We took a Chai cupcake to-go, which was spicy, moist, and topped with the best frosting ever. It's probably best that I don't know what it's made from, and just assume it's unicorn tears. We also had the chocolate chip cookie, which was perfectly crammed with chocolate chips, chewy, hollow, and slightly cinnamon-y. I don't think it needed the cinnamon, but maybe that's because I just had a Chai cupcake. 

Next on my to-eat list is a fresh-baked pie, during pie happy hour on Wednesdays, of course. Overall, my thoughts on Treehouse Bakery can be summed up concisely: YES."}
{"text":"100% vegan bakery with cheap vegan sweeties? Oh yeah! Cupcakes, cookies & cookie bars, brownies, scones, pop tarts, cinnamon rolls, etc., served up in rotating flavors, which are normally posted daily (with the exception of Mondays) on their Facebook page. 

My favorite flavors so far have been the Apple Pie cupcake (Is it an apple pie, or a cupcake? It's the lovechild of both!), the raspberry lemon (icing is to die for!), and... the... SALTED CARAMEL! One bite of that salted caramel had me losing my religion sideways.  Sinfully scrumptious!  The cupcakes are moist, sweet, yummy, and only $2+ change.  Order multiple cupcakes and they come in a nice box that keeps them in safe travels until you arrive at your destination. IF the cupcakes make it that long.

Being the cupcake fiend that I am, I rarely venture into other territories, but I did try a pecan bar once and it was very good.

They sell any left-overs for 1/2 price the next day, and yes, they are still fresh the following day. 

Whole cakes are available for pre-order and the round cakes seem reasonably priced, but the sheet cakes are expense. Pricing available on their website.

Love the bakery. Love the employees (I wish I knew her name, but she has an awesome personality and she keeps me in stitches whenever I come.); they are always extremely helpful and accommodating. Excellent customer service every time.  The worst part about this place is that I don't live next door!"}
{"text":"The ladies at Treehouse bakery knows how to make great tasting treats. Vegan aside, the churro cupcake is one of the best cupcakes I've had. Based on previous vegan cupcakes or baked goods, there is no comparison to Treehouse. One wouldn't know the items were vegan if they tried it. The prices are awesome, too, for any bakery. I've enjoyed every single item I've tried so far. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I had 2 Treehouse Bakery cupcakes at  birthday party and let me tell ya how DELICIOUS they were!  I was immediately in love with the vanilla cupcake, so I basically stole the other one and packed it away to take home- ha!  What a party guest I am huh?  I was told they were vegan and I was looking forward to trying them.  I was super impressed, I think I liked these better than non vegan cupcakes.  the icing was the perfect mixture of sweetness, I hate anything too sweet and artificial tasting- and quite honestly, the frosting makes up at least 50% of a cupcake so I was more than satisfied.  Way to go, Treehouse!"}
{"text":"I love Treehouse baked goodies! Her lemon cupcakes are exceptional and I've never had a cookie of hers I did not adore. I drive miles and miles to get to the Phoenix Public Market just for her cupcakes!  I also appreciate that she participates in many charity vegan bake sales around town. Love that it is run by a generous person who is also an excellent vegan baker!"}
{"text":"Writing a review because some of the negative ones had me laughing my ass off. For the people so bothered by the fact that the owners are not \"vegan or even vegetarian,\" let it go! That hardly qualifies as \"unethical.\" It's not like the awesome sister act behind Treehouse is using the equipment in their kitchen to make their treacherous carnivorous meals or they are eating BLTs as crumbled bacon falls into the cake batter. And as for the complaints about the price, $2.50 is beyond reasonable. As someone who has visited every bakery in central Phoenix at one time or another, their prices for the quality and the presentation are absolutely fair. And if you think their cupcakes can't match up to your own wonderful vegan baking skills, then you should...I don't know...go bake yourself!! And taking your review down a notch because you didn't realize they were vegan and you don't eat vegan, well I think that's more on you than them.

Now, on to what matters: the product itself. Treehouse Bakery has an awesome range of flavors and they made me fall in love with their churro cake. Two years ago, I ordered one for my birthday and they decorated it to fit my request to a tee. Angry Asian Girl cake, YES!! They bend over backwards to fulfill customers' orders and believe me, they have had some doozy of requests. They are more than qualified to run a bakery, vegan or not.

Cori and Amanda are also just genuinely awesome individuals who care about the community. They have helped me out more than once when I needed cupcakes for an event. If you become even a semi-regular, they make you feel like an old friend. The Grand Avenue and Phoenix in general should feel lucky that Treehouse is there and hope that it stays around for the next gajillion years."}
{"text":"This was a yelp find for us.  We were looking for scones and the reviews spoke formtself. The product was really good and reasonably priced.  It looks very ma and pa type of business.  The display was tiny with only a few products.   But that doesn't really matter as long as the product was as good as it was. Was a little sketchy neighborhood but again, the product was worth it."}
{"text":"They did my graduation cake and the compliments were endless! It was a three tier cake and the flavors were chocolate, vanilla and carrot cake. Honestly I am not a cake person and wasn't planning on eating any until it was basically forced down my throat and it was instant love. The flavors were so delicious and unlike anything I have ever had before. Not only that, but the cake as beautiful! I didn't want to cut into it because it looked so pretty. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Cute little hole in the wall that I passed 3x before finally figuring out it was right there in front of me! Came in on a Sunday with a mission to get my mouth full of sweets. Was hoping for a larger selection of goodies as I read all the different flavors in the reviews. I got the pop tarts, S'mores, Pistachio, Chocolate Chip and Pumpkin. Moist goodness with enough sweetness in the icing. Favorite one was Pistachio next to the Chocolate Chip. Would definitely go back now that I know where this place is. Hope they expand as it has potential."}
{"text":"My daughter hasn't reacted to dairy well from day one so when her 1st Birthday came around I wanted to find a place that could make a dairy free cake. During my search I feared I was going to have to pay $30/$40 for a cake that my daughter wouldn't really enjoy and just smash around. After reading reviews on Yelp about Treehouse I thought I would give them a try. I went down and sampled one of their cupcakes..and wow they exceeded my expectations of a Vegan cupcake. My daughter liked them too. I decided right there to order the cake. I was about to pay and then the owner chimes in and asks if I really wanna do a double layered cake since it was just going to be smashed. She figured she'd save me the money by doing a single layered cake. I mean really??!! There are not a lot of business owners out there that would do or say that. My cake ended up only being $10.15!!!!! I picked it up today and it was beautiful. The perfect smash cake for my princess. 

I gave place 5 stars because not only is their customer service absolutely refreshing..but the presentation of their product as well as the taste."}
{"text":"Their brownies are just awesome and the cookies are good too. I only wish they had more gluten free options.. they make one flavor of cupcakes on Tuesday, which they call \"gluten free day\". I was expecting more than just one option. Since they are just as good as the non-gluten free ones, those who don't have an intolerance would still enjoy them. While if you're celiac or want to stay away from wheat, there is a very little selection you can choose from. 
Other than that, almost everything tastes delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with their amazing cupcakes! I am not a vegan or vegetarian and in my opinion these vegan cupcakes are some of the best cupcakes I've ever had."}
{"text":"These girls make the most amazing cupcakes! Nevermind they are vegan, they are incredible! The frosting is impossibly light and delicate and oh so perfect! The French Toast GF vegan cupcake I ordered today was better than the full gluten cupcakes... which is hard to do. I think it may be the best cupcake I've ever eaten. I can't wait to order more! So far the vanilla cupcake and the French Toast are my favorite flavors. I'm dying to try the red velvet and churro flavors. I ordered the cupcakes today for a surprise farewell party and they were such a big hit. Everyone was in heaven. They were perfect:) Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great little place to stop by for a quick coffee and something sweet. I love the brownies most of all. I've noticed many people coming in to pick up large orders of baked goods for parties and stuff."}
{"text":"Her baked goods were awesome I love the cookies the brownies were pretty great my kids love them wish they were closer to my house but the food is good"}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful oasis of vegan yummy goodness!  Yay for having such a great place for vegans to satisfy their sweet teeth!!  I wish there were a few more gluten free options, but it is good to know that on Tuesdays they have more options, so I'll get there when I can on that day."}
{"text":"They really awesome uniques flavors. I never thought vegan pasteries could taste so good. I got a green tea passion fruit which was awesome! The people are super friendly and nice. They have free pins and stickers for kids and those who want them!"}
{"text":"Treehouse made my vegan birthday cake and I fell in love. Now I try to travel to their location every few weeks to try their goodies! Their cupcakes and moist, delicious and fresh! Their cookies and poptarts are to die for as well! I am in love with treehouse vegan goodies and crave them when my sweet tooth starts acting up! Also, many non-vegans ate my birthday cake and they loved it as well!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious! I honestly can't even tell that they're vegan-- their cupcakes, poptarts, brownies, cookies, everything I've tried just tastes amazing. And I've eaten a lot (a LOT) of non-vegan baked goods in my life. They also seem like lovely people and i love their cute happy cupcake logo :)"}
