{"text":"Ken Stewarts East Bank  Most amazing dinner ever!  Dinner for 4, Friday night and everyone was Loving their dinner and experience.  I had the East Bank Mixed Grill.  Filet, ahi tuna and shrimp, all delicious and well presented.  Our Server, Nicole, was possibly the best server we ever met, she was knowledgable, polite and friendly!  She helped make our experience thoroughly enjoyable."}
{"text":"The happy hour is second to none. The oysters are to die for, so good other bars in the area call their oysters \"blue point oysters\""}
{"text":"Lobster mashed potatoes are amazing, quick and excellent service. Classic cream-brulee is delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday evening. The blackened swordfish was excellent, just the right amount of spice. Followed with a key lime tart that was delicious. Very good experience, we will go again."}
{"text":"I'd go into detail about all the things that are so great at this restaurant but you'd be reading hours. I'll restrain myself and keep it to four main compliments: 1. This is a fantastic place to be seen, and the view outside from the tables by the front wall is pretty wonderful too, especially at night. 2. The service is impeccable here. In my experience, they really take their time to make conversation and recommendations. 3. While you'll want to be on your best behavior, it's hard to remain sober with such an exhaustive wine and liquor selection. 4. All of their food is delicious and impressively fresh, but no matter what you order, I'm telling you now that you want the lobster mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Dining here tonight was a great experience!! Lisa was our server. She was friendly efficient and professional!! Even the gentlemen that server the water were friendly and observant to our needs. Thank you to the staff at Blue Point for a great experience. Food was fantastic!! Love the tomato bisque."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant from food to the scenery. We had the oysters and mussels for an appetizer. We shared a lobster bisque which was AMAZING! Then the grouper and surf and turf for our main course. Dessert was a key lime tart. Everything was amazing and I would recommend the food we had that evening. Extremely nice waiter and staff were very attentive. Be warned, it is an expensive place to eat, our bill was just over $200 for both of us including tip. Highly recommend Blue Point Grill."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for our wedding anniversary.   We wanted a nice quiet, upscale seafood restaurant.  I made arrangements with PJ and was assured that the atmosphere would be in line with my needs. He was very right.  This was a very nice restaurant. The clientele was mostly upscale and the atmosphere was perfect. It was clear from the beginning that PJ was very proud of the place... We chose a booth and had an absolutely incredible night.   I ordered the grouper and she the \"My Blue Point Heaven\".   Both were perfect.  In the end, we both loved the restaurant, the wait staff, and PJ.    I would definitely come back to this place, and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Great spot. Very consistent and has been a staple in Cleveland for years. Good wine list too and plenty of food options for everyone's taste."}
{"text":"This is one of the most overrated and overpriced restaurants in Cleveland. I think people go there simply because it seems classy and draws people in. The seafood is not good. The service has been terrible every time I've been there. Their lunch portions are a joke and the food is generally flavorless no matter what time of the day you go. I NEVER send food or drinks back but I actually had to tell the waiter to take my crown and ginger ale back after having my girlfriend and friend taste it and agreeing they actually forgot the whiskey. We had the seafood tower for an appetizer which was pretty good as it should be for $110. For and entree I ordered the \"My Blue Point Heaven\" which was a lobster tail, shrimp, and scallops with their \"famous\" lobster mashed potatoes. I would put it a notch above Red Lobster, no joke. I would not go back nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"As a whole, our meal was underwhelming in its average-ness. The oyster sampler was very nice, but every other course was disappointing. The pork belly appetizer had an apple relish, which was more of an overly sweet puree. It reduced the dish to one, dull note. The tuna entr√©e was undone from the start by a poor sear; a level of execution you might expect from a more middling restaurant.   Service was excellent though.   But the food experience was perhaps the definition of meh. The food scene in Cleveland shouldn't be underestimated. There are a lot of really good places to eat, but last night made us miss New York."}
{"text":"Wow! Packed place for a Wednesday night. If you are looking for an elegant, good seafood place, this is it! Wine choices is so much, food presentation is great, your taste buds will go wild and will complement the sight, smell and taste sensation. Thank you Cleveland for Blue Point!"}
{"text":"Tremendous experience here. Went for new years eve and the place was packed but we were seated as soon as we arrived, even though we were 15 minutes early for our reservation. Our coats were also promptly taken and valet was quick and easy. The lobster bisque was amazing and both dinners were very good (we had snapper special and salmon). Waitstaff was friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Wonderful service, fresh seafood & meats, beautiful & elegant atmosphere --- a highlight of our visit to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour on Friday.  Plan was to sample, have a few drinks and visit.    First round was some raw selections.  The oysters were the best I have ever eaten.  Scrimp were good, crab claws were too much work for me.   Second round was walleye sandwich.  Fish was good, bun was really good but the \"slaw\" that was on top had a very miss matched cut of ingredients on it.  Fries were very crispy which is critical for me!  Third round was the bacon cheese burger.  To my surprise it was really good.  Cooked perfectly.    Bartender was great. She kept dishes and glasses picked up.   She came by enough but never got in the way of our conversation.  My only surprise was $8.50 for a well drink during happy hour caught me off guard when the bill arrived.  I understand it is downtown.    It was a perfect evening great food and company."}
{"text":"I was a speaker for a program. I can't speak highly enough how great the food and service was. Steak cooked perfectly Pittsburg style and the lobster perfect. If that wasn't enough my take home dessert \"something somore\" was simply unbelievable. I know good food and am a tough critic. This place is wonderful and will be a place to go next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was here recently for a business dinner and found the service and food to be outstanding.  We had a group of 8, and the service was attentive from the minute we arrived until we left.  One of the individuals that was in our group likes to switch things up and order things that aren't necessarily on the menu.  The staff met every request without flinching and we were quite pleased.  I started with the lobster bisque, and it was outstanding.  You will not be disappointed if you like lobster bisque.  I had the 'My Blue Point Heaven', which consists of scallops, shrimp and a petite lobster tail, paired with lobster mashed potatoes and green beans.  I substituted asparagus for the beans since I'm not a big bean fan.  The portions we nice, and the portion of lobster mashed potatoes were particularly generous.    I took one bite of the scallops, and I was in heaven.  Scallops are one of my favorites, and these were hands down the best I've ever had in my life.  Prepared perfectly - simply amazing.  The shrimp and lobster were also excellent, and I really liked the lobster mashed potatoes also.  Highly recommended if you are a seafood fan."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Every time i come here my meal is excellent.  BEST calamari i have ever had.  Go all out and get the surf and turf."}
{"text":"Never in my life did I think I'd be able to get such good seafood in Cleveland. I was looking for a special place to have dinner with my boyfriend, a friend and my parents after my senior recital and Blue Point Grille delivered big time! Our table was ready right away, my gin and tonic was delicious and strong, and our waiter was charismatic and took very good care of us. I ordered the prix fixe menu with the nag's head grouper, crab topped filets, and the chocolate bombe for dessert. We also ordered a round of oysters on the half shell and some lobster mashed potatoes for the table. My boyfriend got the yellowtail with sweet potato bacon puree and grilled zucchini which was the special, my mom got the scallops and my dad got the grilled swordfish. Everyone was very happy with their orders! Highlights were definitely the oysters and the yellowtail.   Based on the seafood alone, I would be more than happy to give them 5 stars, but there were a few things that brought it down to 4. For one, my filet came with really flavorless green beans and some mashed potatoes that paled in comparison to the lobster mash, which was disappointing compared to the sides that other people got. But maybe that was just my fault for ordering the prix fixe menu.   I would absolutely return here if I wanted to get seafood again. Reasonable prices, awesome food, and great service."}
{"text":"I love this place. The seafood is great, they serve really filling portions and sides. The atmosphere is great. I have never been disappointed here. Order anything, from soups to entrees, let the sun shine on you through the big windows, and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I phoned in the reservation, making sure to explain that this was our anniversary & was supposed to be special.  We sipped some well-poured drinks in the bar & waited for a table, all the while eyeballing the dining room under the chandeliers.  Here is the beginning of the NOT So Great part.  We were shown a table directly behind our stools at the bar, in the bar section! Okay, you could see outside with the Terminal Tower lit, but you also had the waitstaff hanging in the corner by their stand.  Not to mention, piped in rock music!  Okay, home of rock and roll & all that, but in a place like this? Also noticed that for a place with a dress code, people had on jeans, flannel shirts and one guy was wearing his ball cap on his head.  That tainted my night. The food was very good, but with some unusual twists.  The hubby's salmon was not as good as his own he cooks at home, and the key lime pie was a bit pretentious, as it was overpowered and hidden by the glob of meringue on top.  Having lived in FL for some years, we both laughed and had a suspicion about eating it.  It was tasty, but was overkill.  But the oddest thing was this:  we were presented with a little creme brulee for our anniversary by our waiter (who was very good).  How nice, we thought, a little thoughtful gesture (especially since you essentially sat us in the bar).  But lo and behold, they actually billed us for it on our ticket!  I kid you not!  Tacky, tacky. Nice to try once, but with so many other great locales to check out, we think we will move on."}
{"text":"First time having Walleye!  My meal and the server were wonderful.  I enjoyed my  customized dinner of walleye, crab risotto and asparagus.  A little more seasoning on the fish would have made it a 5 star experience.  I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here. Our group all enjoyed their meals. We had the seared ahi tuna, sirloin and copper river salmon. We also had oysters which were delicious. Service was great!"}
{"text":"My Texan brother and his West Virginia colleague were in town and I was tasked with finding a dinner restaurant.  I needed a \"something for everyone\" type of restaurant for the guys since I didn't know the colleague and his food preferences at all.  I hadn't been to Blue Point for about 6 years and didn't know if it was still as good as I remembered.  Mission accomplished - everyone was more than happy with their meals.  De-lish cornmeal coated calamari appetizer, my crab legs were very good and the guys both had yellow tuna with each happy with their selection.  The only thing I would not recommend was the 5 part chocolate dessert platter-thing.  Nothing special.  The  only problem of the night was as we were leaving I was handed my car keys from the valet as my car was parked directly outside the door.  As we said our goodbyes, two policewomen ticketed my car.  As I explained to them that I was literally just walking out the door and the valet had left the car there, I had to pound on BP door (as the restaurant was now closed) to find the valet or restaurant \"official\" to confirm to the ladies in blue that in was the valet who left the car.  Apparently this has been a problem before and the valet service has been warned by the police.  All I cared about was that the ticket was invalidated and it was (at least the officers said it was?!).  All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"A rainy cold Spring day serving on jury duty in Cleveland begged for a nice lunch out.  Blue Pointe Grill, it was Sharp interior.  Off-putting look from the three Hosts as i walked in NOT wearing business attire. Server was friendly and quick. Lunch Trio is kindly-priced for a more upscale joint, and was just the right amount of food. Lobster Minestrone was yummy and comforting on this cold day. Didn't dig how mayonnaisey the dressing was on the Wedge salad.  Seared Trout slider with miso dressing was pretty darn good ... but oh!  I could've eater a soup bowl full of the miso dressing! Dipping the complimentary bread in it was better than dessert - and believe me, I love dessert!  Easily the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"I went to Blue Point for the second time during Restaurant Week and enjoyed it.  Prix Fixes restaurant week menu: http://www.downtowncleveland.com/media/82851/blue_point_grille_2013.pdf  I chose the Iceberg Salad, Salmon and Key Lime Pie. Everything was great.  The salad was the perfect size starter so I wasn't full but was enough to tide me over to the main course.  A side note, the bread is AWESOME...I think I ate a whole loaf.  The salmon was delicious, the glaze and sweet potato when so well with the salmon.  I didn't really like the brussel sprouts, they were pretty bland.  The key lime pie was also tasty.  The Boyfriend got the seafood chowder, seared scallops and key lime pie.  He loved everything.  We ate here last winter off the standard menu and loved it.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Probably the only good restaurant in Cleveland. I spent 3 weeks in the city and probably had some of the worst dining experiences of my life. The Blue Point Grille made up for it though. The seafood was excellent (despite the fact that Cleveland's on a lake). The atmosphere was just right and the wait staff were very professional ."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of the restaurant, great for special occasions. The food was nicely presented, and the service was timely and very friendly. I do have to say that you pay for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The place seems like a local hot spot, but I wasn't terribly impressed with it. One of our dishes came out with the fish overcooked the first time, so they made another one. In the mean time my dish was getting cold. The fish itself was fine (when done appropriately) but the sides were rather salty but otherwise uninteresting. At the prices they are charging, it's really not acceptable. The server was responsive when the fish was wrong but a bit pretentious otherwise. The entire restaurant feels like it takes itself too seriously and, worse yet, that they have a right to because of the history of the place. It isn't that good."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever eaten and I've eaten quite a few. The meal was incredible the atmosphere was great and the service was wonderful. I can't say enough good things. The lobster Bisque was on special and it was just to die for. Great price too."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my hubby. Ambience was nice. Hostess was friendly however the waiter was frazzled. The surf and turf was delicious!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best restaurant experiences' we've had anywhere...everything was excellent from the Salmon & Scallops to the Lobster Bisque...also the server ( Joanne ) did an exceptional job!"}
{"text":"My family of out of towners had a thoroughly enjoyable experience here. It is pretty hard for a restaurant to get full marks from my family of picky eaters but this place managed it. So, the food was excellent and well presented. I like the fact that the dining room is bright and airy with the tables not crammed together like it can be sometimes. Plus the serving staff were really on the ball and professional. We had a great time and I am only sorry it will be a while before we get another chance to go back."}
{"text":"Can't expect less than perfection here.  I enjoyed my lobster trio and the cold seafood tower -- who wouldn't.  The atmosphere was good, and the staff were great.  I will come back and try some other things next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The food was EXCELLENT, we haven't had service this good since being at Nola's in New Orleans. A great pick for our 27 year anniversary,  we'll definitely return."}
{"text":"After so many hyped-up recommendations from friends and family to dine at Blue Point, my husband and I returned from our dinner slightly disappointed. Actually, friends and family were a little surprised that we had not yet visited Blue Point, especially knowing that we enjoy trying new restaurants - to the point where we often begin planning our trips with the restaurants we plan on dining at while visiting that city. It may have been the hyped up recommendations that perhaps set our expectations too high.  Location: What can I say - Blue Point has it made with their location.   Service: Service was great. Our server was extremely friendly, taking a few moments to provide small talk in between visiting her other tables and trying to make appropriate recommendations for us based on what she thought we'd enjoy. Kudos to her - unfortunately, can't remember her name at the moment. Also, the valet was attentive and prompt.  Atmosphere: My husband and I typically enjoy laid-back restaurants with courteous service, a great wine list and well-prepared food. As soon as we walked into Blue Point, the first thing we commented on was the noise level. Although we weren't dining there to celebrate Valentines Day (visited February 13), we were anticipating a somewhat quiet dining experience. If you are visiting Blue Point for this experience, don't. It's partly the loft-like structure of the building that resulted in the poor acoustics. And, sitting upstairs may have lent to the extreme noise, as all chatter seemed to gravitate toward our table. At one point our server had to ask us to repeat our order because it was so loud. Now, there appeared to be a group of after-work diners - all busily texting away on their Blackberrys - behind us, so that may have been part of the noise issue. The ambiance seemed to be one of \"the place to be seen\", which isn't an ambiance my husband and I go out of our way to partake. The decor was nice and cohesive, though.  Food: Tasty, but for the price and ambiance the restaurant was trying to portray, under whelmed. This was a clear example of where \"less is more\" would've done the trick for Blue Point. We ordered the calamari appetizer after an enthusiastic recommendation from our very friendly server. What arrived at our table was just shy of being a family-style portion you'd expect to receive at Buca de Beppo. And, the bold flavors of the calamari - although pleasant for the first few bites - quickly became overwhelming and the spiciness just lingered in your mouth, not allowing for any flavor of the tender calamari to shine through. I will give credit as they sprinkled some toasted cashews into the mix, which added a nice texture amidst the somewhat soggy breading. When our server returned, she seemed surprised with the surplus and said she'd bring a box. We kindly declined as it's rare calamari is ever good-tasting heated up. Our entrees arrived shortly after and there was the momentary \"ahhh, filet and lobster\", quickly followed by \"wow, that's a lot of food\". I'm big on presentation, and that's one thing Blue Point was lacking. Rather than an elegant plating of a petite filet, lobster tail and sides, my large dinner plate was filled brim to brim with a mound of mashed potatoes, which served as a perch for the lobster tail. The filet was resting by the lobster tail, and surrounded by green beans. While I can't fault Blue Point for giving you great value for your money, I couldn't help but feel like I was getting a heaping plate as if I were at a seafood bake in New England - just shy of receiving the half corn on the cob!   We'd likely return, if accompanied with good company. Food was good - not top-notch for the prices - and nothing to complain in terms of service. But, based on some reviews I've read that boast that Blue Point is \"the best (seafood) restaurant in town\", I'm still a little puzzled by those claims. If you're looking for top-notch seafood, for the same - if not lower - prices as Blue Point, make sure to dine at The Club at Hillbrook in Chagrin Falls. Sure, you don't get the convenient downtown location, but I'd be quite surprised if you don't enjoy the food and the beautiful scenery."}
{"text":"I forgot to write a review on this place! I can't be too accurate because it has been several months since we ate there, but I just have to say something!   We loved the food and came away with happy-fullbellies and a food induced high."}
{"text":"Happy Hour only. You can't beat this, really. The prices and variety and QUALITY of food they offer is outstanding. Salmon Caesar was incredible. Salmon was perfectly cooked and a huge portion for only $9. Lobster Risotto was inspired...off night maybe bc it tasted more of alcohol than savory (sherry didn't cook off perhaps), but regardless I know this is a great dish with large peices of lobster.   I also had the Blue Point Oysters and Jonah Crab Claws. Both were delicious and a steal at $1 and $1.50.   Service was great, bartenders were amazingly attentive despite a large party coming through.   I will definitely come back, and you should too!"}
{"text":"I went here with my son for dinner on a Saturday night. It was busy and we didn't have a reservation, but luckily we were able to get a high top table. The service was excellent! The waitress was prompt and friendly. My son ordered the Oyster appetizer and loved it. For dinner, he had the lobster tail. He said it was delicious. I had the Crabcake entree. The crabcakes were on top of a honey dijon sauce. They were probably the best crab cakes I have ever had -full of crabmeat and very tasty! I had a glass of the Villa Moscato. It was light and sweet, so good! I recommend this restaurant, but be prepared to pay a lot. It was about $100 before the tip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Cleveland restaurants. Great lunch spot if you work downtown or are looking to do business lunch. The scallops are delicious and the prices seem pretty reasonable. Happy hour is also excellent!!"}
{"text":"We ate at blue point before a concert at quicken arena. Loved it! Great menu, service, location and food. My husband had the filet Oscar and I had the grouper on the recommendation of our server. Both were fantastic as was the service. I would definitely recommend this place and wish there was one closer to us."}
{"text":"Service beyond reproach in a white table cloth yet casual lunch atmosphere. I could tell these guys were not rookies at food preparation and service. My salmon was cooked to delicate perfection, the risotto was al dente and silky as it should be and my salad seriously hit the spot. I'd return and recommend it to anyone, anytime. Why not 5 stars? I think I may give to many 5 stars because I seem to chose the right places more often than not, but it deserves 4.5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"The food was good. I don't have any specific complaints about it other than not being sure if it is worth dropping $200 considering you also have to pay for parking. Pier W in Lakewood is more worth the $ because you get a lakeside view and can order oysters by the dozen.   My chief complaint is more social. My husband had been working at a project at NASA all day, and I did not have much time to meet him there after he said he'd like to go to dinner. It was a Friday, meaning that he did not need to dress up to go to work. Since I had to leave in a split I was not dressed up either. We arrive to find a half-filled restaurant. The hostess looked us up and down, saw that we were the only folks dressed casually, and said she had no booths or low tables because she was booked, and we would have to sit at a hightop in the back (looked like the only one). I believe that what happened here was that she made an erroneous class judgement based on attire. The restaurant was only half-filled by the time we left as well. The table was about 18 inches wide, and this was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I had the salmon with red rice which was delicious. The salmon was cooked to perfection. The meal was really upstaged by dessert however. We ordered the flourless chocolate cake...oh. my. Word. I will be back just for that cake!!! The service was great, he was very attentive and knowledgeable.  We sat on the 2nd floor balcony which had a nice view and the restaurant as a whole had a very comfortable feel even though it was a little more upscale."}
{"text":"Our second visit. Sunday night and busy. Prompt seating. Very nice service. Good wine list. Seared ahi tuna was good but cold and more like sushi. Salmon, asparagus and potatoes were smothered in butter sauce."}
{"text":"NOT ALL THAT ......... Went here for my 29th anniversary was not please. Customer service was good we only had to wait about five min to be seated.I ordered grouper with lobester mash potatoes it was just OK I have tasted better @ RL. Husband ordered the steak it was sent back because it was not done. Waitress  brought it back out it was over done which was hard and dry. The decor was OK . I am giving it 3 stars because of customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great seafood and wine list. Make sure to save room for some creme br√ªl√©e and a espresso."}
{"text":"After much debate / walking around the Warehouse District in Cleveland I decided to give the Blue Point a shot. Initial interaction with the hostess was cold. Yes, I'm solo. Yes, you hate your job. Yes, I would like a booth. And... no, you are not awesome.  So I meander through the not so welcoming greeting and settle in. Right off the bat I tried the warm bread with the honey butter... brilliant!   At this point my mouth was getting excited! What's next?! How about some Seafood Chowder? Certainly! The catch was, though the presentation was solid, the chowder was rather bland. I've had better from Campbell's (and with Campbell's I got an Andy Warhol art work as well!). Advantage Campbell's. (Unfortunately the Velvet Underground was not on the radio)  Next was the main course, Grouper, as recommended by my very affable server (he called me \"Friend\" from the get so obviously we were friends... from the get). As with the chowder, the presentation fit the ambiance but the taste did not. Initial bite, I could taste a hint of lemon juice... interest. So I continued. The fish was un-memorably blah though the exterior had a decent crunch. As I trudged forth, it became beyond evident that either this fish lived in the Great Salt Lake... OR... the only seasoning they had in the back was salt. It was over powering, couple that with a bit of salt spinach, salt based lobster mashed potatoes and a dash of vermouth cream and you have an overpriced salt lick. With the main course costing $33 I felt obligated to finish it. It was a pain.   Eating should not be a pain. For that reason, the max rating I am allowed to provide is 2 Stars (you can thank the bread for those stars)."}
{"text":"Came for an anniversary dinner with high expectations. All in all, these expectations were met and exceeded. The physical appearance of the location was very appealing and inviting from the beginning. We were quickly seated where we were met by phenomenal service from the entire staff throughout the night. The waitress provided great recommendations and made sure we had top-quality service. The food was nothing short of expectation as well. Highly recommend the Nags Head Grouper, an item that has remained unchanged on their simple, but intriguing menu for almost two decades. After our main entree, we were give a complimentary dessert in honor of the anniversary. Will definitely return, and recommend to others."}
{"text":"If you are lover of seafood, this place is for you ! If you are the vegan or vegetarian in your group, you are in trouble! Having said that, we dined here a couple of weeks ago and were very impressed with the ambiance, decor and service. Impeccable is the word that comes to mind. Our group had the scampi and mushroom appetizers and both were delicious - the sauce with the scampi was incredible. Dinner entrees ordered were the seafood platter which came with lobster and scampi- Incredibly delicious ! The scamp entree was a good sized one and the sauce and base added a wonderful fusion of flavors that will keep bringing us back for more.  My only hiccup - the amount of butter used in the dishes. It left me with a greasy taste in my mouth. Butter adds the sparkle to any dish - but too much turns the delight into a feeling of unease.  All in all, a great dining experience at an excellent establishment."}
{"text":"I was at the bar, some guy complained he didn't like the walleye and wanted something else - the bar staff was more than gracious and switched it out with nothing but apologies. He was quite satisfied with his new dish - the salmon. Not sure about the wait staff but the bar staff is legit and pros for sure.   One thing to consider is the oyster rock. I'm from upstate New York and grew up on traditional oysters Rockefeller. Something happened in the 2000's where general oyster Rockefeller turned into this wussy spinach bacon creamy baked crap. This place brings back the original (and correct) way to prepare them - herbs and breadcrumbs. If yer an old schooler - you will appreciate the rare and respectful nod. Kudos!  4 stars because.....while the muscles are awesome ...... whoooa take it easy with the salt there buddy!! I'll be puckering for days! Salt overload!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I were really excited to dine here. It was our first time in Cleveland. Menu looked great. Yelp reviews were excellent.  Food was pretty good. Appetizer was my favorite.  The reason why I gave only one star is because twice the manager walked around asking people how their food was. Each time he passed our table and spoke so obviously to only the tables around us. Why did he happen to miss us both times and get to all the other tables? I am not sure why- but we are in 2012. I'm sure you know better than that.   How disappointing Blue Point Grill and Cleveland.  Easy to say I've been treated way better anywhere else. And I've been to the classiest restaurants in NYC and Philadlephia (among other cities). I'm not sure I'll be making my way back to Cleveland, let alone this place you call a restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was great. I had shrimp and scallops and my wife had swordfish and red grits, both were very good, cappuccino after our dinner was very good as well."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant in a vibrant location.  Fish is excellent.  Salad plus entree = $35 - $40 per person."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour! If you like oysters, shrimp, salmon cesear salad or a classic cheeseburger(yes a seafood place with a good burger) this is the spot for you! Sometimes it is hard to get a seat at the bar since Blue Point only does happy hour in the bar - but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent swordfish steak!  Atmosphere is classy and comfortable. Wait staff was good. All at our table enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"This place is overrated.  Food is under-seasoned, tasteless and gloppy.  Our waiter told us some of their dishes have been on the menu for 15 years - that may be the problem."}
{"text":"This meal was one of the highlights of our stay in Cleveland. Our server, Kim, was attentive, personable and so very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. The atmosphere was wonderful and the seafood was pure perfection. Don't miss out on the chocolate flourless cake for dessert! The four of us could honestly say that the meal met every expectation and was as good as any we have had in other first class cities."}
{"text":"my husband was in town for only the night so i flew in to stay with him we asked the hotel for a recommendation. they recommeded blue point but we couldnt get a reservation. so we decided to drive around downtown clevelanf and just find a spot. we walked first into Blue point and actually got a seat at the nar.   i had a dirty martini and it was excellent ....just the right amount of dirty. the server brought out  fresh  bread and it was warm and fluffy.  we ordered the smaller tower and the sea food was great. the smoked mussels were thw best i had and the giamt crab legs came cut amd ready to gi and ice cold. i had never had crab legs that werent warm...but after ha ing yhem ice cold this is my new favorite way!   i had the filet oscor and it was great with the potatos. the hubby had the scallops with zuchinni and they tasted sweet like candy.    for dessert we gad the truffle with vanilla icecream. the truffle was super rich and hit the spot.  tgia place was overall amazing and im glad we got in  i now want my hubby to have more trips to cleaveland. i would ne on thw next plane out and ready for dinner! its not a cheap place but well worth thw food!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to celebrate my finance's promotion! The service was amazing. Our waiter explained the menu, made recommendations, and then just let us kind of explore. Wine was great, appetizer (scallops) were delicious, and my meal was probably the best one I've ever had! I like this place too because the portions are on point. I'm so tired of restaurants giving  you double what they should. This place is worth the extra $$"}
{"text":"My review is for happy hour only. Awesome prices for an upscale experience. Loved the martinis and the walleye sandwich with fries was delicious. They could do a better job not burning the bread of the lobster roll but I really liked everything else. We shared the mussels and they are a most!! The bread the serve is really good in both flavor and texture. I really recommend this happy hour."}
{"text":"This review is hard to write for me because I have wanted to try this place for so long and finally got the chance and I really was not happy with my own choice for an entree. I ordered the Lobster Bolognese and I know what you're thinking, \"why would you order that at a higher end seafood place?\" Well, I have ordered lobster pasta dishes at many high end restaurants and they have been fabulous! This lobster though, was so ground up that it took away from Lobster even being a high end item to order. Again, I know it's my fault for ordering it but I was very let down.   On the upswing. My fiance's dish was fantastic! He ordered the grouper which is the first thing on the entree list and that dish delivered! I wish I had ordered that!   Quick note: Make sure you make reservations for the weekend this place is packed until closing time."}
{"text":"Delicious was delicious! The lobster soup... Amazing! Highly recommended. Great food great service."}
{"text":"Incredible is the word I would use.  Everything about our visit was first class.  The entire staff was great, from the host that seated us, the service staff and our waitress.  We all enjoy seafood so this was our place.  The lobster Bolognese, Ahi tuna and even the walleye were fantastic.  When we have visitors in from other cities, they always ask about finding a great place to eat.  Blue Point Grill is at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Cleveland is developing a reputation for excellent dining and deservedly so. The Blue Point Grille should be considered one of the better places to eat in Cleveland. The only other seafood place I am aware of is Pier W, which was old and tired when I used to live in Cleveland (it could have changed of course). Blue Point Grille is much more current and interesting.  First, the interior of this place is gorgeous. they have used the character of an old building to create a chic, yet warm environment. Even on a cold, snowy evening, the Blue Point Grille's tall windows looked stunning as we gazed out into Public Square.   The food was very good. I had swordfish that was quite tasty and the rest of my party seemed to be enjoying their entrees as well. The lobster bisque was delicious.   A lot of reviewers seem to think this place is pricey, maybe it is for Cleveland, but not compared to Los Angeles (where I live now). I thought it was generally what you would expect to pay for good food."}
{"text":"We've been dining at Blue Point Grille for over a decade.  While on occasion we have issues with the cookery of the fish, the stellar meals far outweigh the duds.  Great place to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Had the grouper and tuna app. Just ok is the only way to describe it. Service was excellent but the bill about knocked me off my chair."}
{"text":"Food = ? (did not eat) Price = 4 Experience = 4  This is a super nice building and interior... classy but relaxed."}
{"text":"My go-to for upscale dinner in Cleveland downtown proper. Happy hour food and drink prices are LOW for the quality which is HIGH."}
{"text":"I have gone to blue pointe grill twice now and both times it was a great experience. Our server Dave is so friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu and gives great recommendations. We had him both times we went there and both times he was awesome. We had the paradise martinis... pear flavored and to die for. Our entrees were top notch both times. Tonight I had the special... a 12 oz bison steak. How many times can you get a quality bison steak?? It's a bit pricey but well worth it. Definitely a great place to spend a nice occasion on and ask for Dave! You won't regret!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience.  I had the crab cake and the szechuan green beans and both were delicious. The crab cake is served with honey mustard and a house slaw that made it the best-tasting, non-traditional crab cake I've ever had.  Mom had the grouper and said it was great.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Every time I go past this place it's packed--whether it's lunchtime or dinner time."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 8 for my birthday and was not impressed at all.  First, the good: service was great. The waiter was attentive and we were seated at the time of our reservation.  As for food: Stick to the lobster bisque and oysters, avoid any entree. 6/8 people in our party did not like their meal AT ALL, the other two said it was \"ok\".  After waiting almost an hour to be served, all three people that got \"Blue Pointe Heaven\" were not happy. One was sent back entirely, but it had been so late she didn't want anything else, and two were so hungry by the time the meals came out they picked their way through overcooked seafood and terrible mashed lobster less potatoes, which I still swear were instant. I got the commodore and was underwhelmed by the filet, overcooked lobster, and devoured the one thing that wasn't ruined: the asparagus.  Everything else was just mediocre at best, not even remotely worth the price. The manager apologized, did take money off the bill, however the meal was already beyond ruined. Clearly, the meals sat too long, and the preparation was nothing special, I've had better seafood and steak at chain restaurants. We definitely won't be back. Having one bad meal in a party of 8 wouldn't be devastating, but when the majority of the table describes their $40-70 meal as \"ok\" it's unacceptable."}
{"text":"Favorite Seafood place in Cleveland and a must try is the blue point heaven dish.. Also great happy hour and GREAT service."}
{"text":"One of the finest restaurants in the downtown area. If you are a seafood fan then this is the place to go. They have plenty of non-seafood entrees to choose from but seafood is the real reason to come here.  I'd recommend the Hawaiian Ahi Tuna. Expertly prepared. Really can't go wrong with anything on the menu in my opinion.   Drinks are well priced and tasty. Do yourself a favor and get a French 75 to kick off the dinner and finish off with your choice of scotch.  My real only gripe is that the service is hit or miss. Your server doesn't make or break this restaurant but it can make it seem like your more of a customer than a guest."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  There were 3 of us and all of our food was perfect.  We had the lobster bisque, grouper, salmon, scallops and wine.  Everything tasted wonderful.  Our waiter was also very helpful with our choices.  Would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with customers on a rainy Thursday evening in April.  The food here is great for seafood lovers. We started with an oyster sampler with 4 different delicious oysters well prepared and a nice mignonette in addition to the cocktail sauce.  The smoked mussels were a bit odd at first because they were served cold and none of us had ever eaten them cold.  However, they grew on us and we all agreed we would order them again.  Fun to try...  The lobster bisque is one of the best I've had.  Our entrees - a tuna special that was great, but the star of the dish was the smoked cauliflower pur√©e, the snapper special, and the nag's head grouper which was worth coming back for.  Also had a nice, reasonable wine selection.  The Rombauer Chardonnay was excellent.  Would definitely return when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I will never be returning due to the way I was treated. It was my first time in Cleveland so I thought I would give the place a try. The food was mediocre at best, but what ruined the experience for me was the waiter. He added bacon to my sandwich which I had told him I could not eat bc I am Muslim. He then left and came back with the same exact sandwich, with just the bacon taken out. Cross contamination is a big issue and I am surprised he didn't even bother to act like he made me a new sandwich. I ended up paying $13 for a sandwich that I did not even touch."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner before going out for New Years Eve celebration's and I have to say I was not impressed. The ambiance of the place was upscale but there where people in jeans and that ruined it for me. I think the food is pretty good but I have had better at this price point. We where a party of 8 so we tried a wide variety of the menu and no one was blown away by anything."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! I am a concierge at a major downtown hotel, and I send my guests here all of the time. Having been in the city for awhile, Blue Point still stands out to me as one of Cleveland's finest eateries. Everything is so fresh and delicious, and you can tell they hold both their food and their service to high standards. The lobster bisque is amazing, and I would highly recommend getting your steak done \"Oscar Style.\" The service is also excellent. They do a very good job of anticipating the needs of their guests and exceeding expectations. Blue Point has my stamp of approval, and I look forward to continuing to send my guests here.   Best Regards, Sam Hartman"}
{"text":"Enjoyed BPG during Cleveland Restaurant week.   My group stuck to the prefix menu, which is what lead me to choosing BPG over many other restaurants that night!   App was their famous Nags Head grouper over lobster mash, and that dish will make fish lover out of anyone!  Ordered off menu next for the Local Beets salad, it was delicious, the dressing perfect blend of sweet and tangy, may be a bit overpriced at 9, had similar elsewhere for 6 or 7.  Dinner was jumbo shrimp and scallops over mash with green beans. I really was having trouble deciding btwn this, the filet Oscar style, and the preztel crust walleye.   Went with my choice based on high raves from the table next to us, she did mention the green beans were barely cooked.  She was right on all counts, wonderful seafood, too crunchy green beans.  Dessert was choc. Bomb with raspberry coulis and vanilla ice crm, sort of boring old thing, but tasted as expected, the other prefix offering was raspberry cheesecake.    Where's the creme br√ªl√©e?    We were seated first floor, which would be a nice table except somehow when the doors open diners are blasted with cold air.  Overall, great place, I'd go back for regular menu to try more seafood and fish, they obviously have those mastered."}
{"text":"The ambiance was exactly what we needed, up-scale, vibrant, romantic, and not at all \"stuffy\".  So many options for pescatarians, a lot of seafood dishes have some sort of pork in it.  The scallops were to die for, perfectly seated, on a creamy cauliflower pur√©e.  My husband had the blackened swordfish and loved it.  This is 4 stars because our server was a bit odd and fake friendly, it was uncomfortable.  Everything else was perfect!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner when on vocation in Cleveland. The staff were super friendly and the atmosphere was great!  The oysters were freaking incredible! The lobster bisque soup was even better! All the food was great in general, can't complain about that.   The reason the place lost 2 stars was the fact that we liked the place so much, we returned 2 nights later and were provided a totally different experience with a different waiter. He wasn't as nice, was an older fellow who just seemed annoyed more than anything, and kept making comments about the table sitting next to us. Food was just as good; the service on the second night was definitely lacking. Had that been our first time I wouldn't have returned again."}
{"text":"I love Bluepoint and frequently visit for oysters, we went for early Valentines Day Dinner the couples menu was a great deal with great menu choices to choose from the lobster bisque was creamy and delicious the oyster sampler is always a must the lobster tail was seasoned just right no need for butter at all. This place is always my favourite and was pleasantly surprised at the valentines value."}
{"text":"The food was great our waiter was very helpful.  Had a very nice meal"}
{"text":"Seared tuna was excellent! Sides were fresh and delicious. If it wasn't for the service I would've given this 5 stars!! They put me in the corner (I was dining solo) which was actually kind of nice, unfortunately they also forgot they sat me in that corner. Slow on refills and when I asked for the check I waited for more than 10 minutes for the server to come back without my check and then ask if I just wanted him to run the card and bring the itemized receipt.  There were only 4 parties in the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"Took my mother hear for her birthday and loved it, such great service and food. Easily one of the best restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The food is good, well presented and the menu has some exciting options and interesting flavor combinations. For the quality of food, I think the price is quite high, however, you don't come here for just the food. The wait staff are all very friendly and professional, the location excellent, the atmosphere is very special, and the decor is very elegant.   I would come here for a night out for a special occasion, but it definitely wouldn't be on the list for regular rotation."}
{"text":"Came for my fianc√©'s birthday dinner. First - get the  grouper it was amazing! I had crab cakes which I thought were just ok. I also thought the lobster potatoes could have more lobster, but regardless they were still tasty.  They have \"blue point\" oysters which are supposed to be special. We did not end up getting that kind but the (cheaper) oysters we got worked out just fine.  They brought him a special dessert bc it was his birthday and did not charge us which was really nice. We made our reservation online which was simple and easy!"}
{"text":"Went here on NYE and it is always one of my favorites. Nice upscale decor, professional and attentive service without being overbearing. Menu is pricy, but not not the most expensive in town. Specialize in Seafood but also some fantastic steaks.   On NYE two of us split a lobster bisque and chop salad. Both of which were fantastic. We then shared the Chilled Mega Seafood Tower. This consisted of two whole lobsters, king crab legs and Jonah claws, amazing smoked mussels, oysters, shrimp and lobster/crab salad. It was a ton of food, all delicious and we had to work to a finish it.  Washed down with a Great Lakes Christmas Ale and a most delightful Muscato.   Another fantastic Blue Point experience! Check it out for various restaurant weeks. They usually have one of the better 3 course deals.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite restaurants downtown. The service is always a class above the rest and you really do feel taken care of while you're here.   My favorites are the fresh oysters, shrimp cocktail and crab claws (especially if you're coming here for happy hour!) I also love the lobster risotto and grilled salmon caesar. They also have rotating specials which do not disappoint. Try it out if you're downtown and looking for great seafood."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!  From the service to the food!!!! My husband and I went last weekend!   Best dinner we had in a long time.   But this really exceeded our expectations!!!  Oysters, lobster bisque, Hawaiian big eye tuna, the heaven dish, wine and the blueberry key lime pie!!! All to die for!!!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars- I came here for lunch with the co-workers to celebrate a birthday.  It was a very good lunch experience, especially for other restaurants around that area.   The bread and butter is nothing too amazing, but the bread is warmed to juse the right temperature where the butter just lightly melts all over the bread. The butter is also very fragrant and just enhances the smell of the bread. The soups were heavy- both the seafood chowder and the lobster bisque.  Of course, they are cream based, but a cup of either can pretty much be your lunch.    I had their signature grouper, which was light and very tasty, but still satisfying. The sauce was a little heavy and rich, but when you get it on the side- the fish is still very delicious.  The fish is flaky and moist with the skin very so crisp from the frying / grilling. The lobster mashed potatoes were a bit plain; just chunks of losbter in the creamy mashed potatoes- still good, but not the best mashed potatoes.   The decor is a bit cheesy with the seafaring / nautical ship theme- navy and gold, but still very comfortable casual elegance.  The service was good and the waiters did a fairly good job of keeping the glasses of sodas and lemonades full (it was lunch time so no need for alcohol yet) and checking on the table in a timely fashion.   I can't wait for the next lunch to try the trio and maybe even a little dessert!"}
{"text":"Quite impressive that they're able to pull off such incredible seafood right here in the Great Lakes.  Every dish is classic, yet carefully prepared with the freshest seafood.  Most the dishes are traditional, but there are a few inventive sides like the lobster-mashed potatoes.  If you like lobster, I recommend the Lobster Bolognese."}
{"text":"Husband brought me for lunch and it was very nice.  Got the seafood sampler and the smoked mussels were delicious. The oysters were great with their cocktail sauce. ..the shrimp were nothing special..honestly very bland and chewy. The Caesar salad was great, the anchovies were a great compliment.  We will try this place again for dinner.  $110 for lunch for two... the staff and experience is well worth the money."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here Saturday night with friends to celebrate a birthday and we were nothing short of amazed. We've been here before and were impressed but this time Blue Point took it to another level. We ordered a very reasonably priced bottle of Veuve to start the night off before our appetizers. I chose to start with the oyster sampler which featured 2 pairs each of west and east coast oysters. They came with a house made cocktail sauce and mignonette which complimented the briny goodness of each. My wife went with the arugula salad which she enjoyed. I admit, I was torn, I wanted and ordered the lobster tail only to change at the last minute to the Nag's Head grouper and I was happy I did. It was cooked perfectly and accompanied by lobster mash and braised spinach in a lemon butter sauce. It was phenomenal. My wife ordered the crab cakes which were all crab and no filler. You don't find crab cakes like that around here. We were very pleased as was everyone with their apps and entrees. The service was excellent, exactly what you would expect in an establishment of this caliber. We can't wait to celebrate again. Well done Blue Point."}
{"text":"I had a pretty unmemorable lunch here; the only thing worth mentioning is the chicken eggroll appetizer.  It was very unique and definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The Tower appetizer is not to be missed. So much fun. Our group of 7 ordered an additional dozen and half oysters. The calamari was also excellent The grouper with lobster mashers was over the top good. Every fish entree was delivered with beautiful presentation, wonderful service and tasted amazing We also had a vegetarian in the group who was pleasantly surprised  Definitely recommend for service, ,food quality and atmosphere"}
{"text":"This review is only on the Happy Hour menu (4 - 10 PM Sundays, 3 - 6:30 PM Monday to Friday)   I had this on my list for a while and finally got to try this place out on a spontaneous whim. For someone who loves seafood, the $1 oysters made this place very attractive. We obviously had not planned on dining here since we walked in clearly underdressed after coming from Edgewater Park. (Probably best to dress up a little). The staff was friendly and was able to seat us in the bar area for the Happy Hour Menu. The menu itself is simple, with a few choices of seafood, some cooked dishes, and a few drinks. We had to try almost everything so we got the lobster risotto ($6), oysters ($1 each), crab claws ($1.50) and shrimp cocktail (ONE jumbo shrimp for $2). The lobster risotto came out first and was surprisingly delicious! I was expecting something that only had an essence of lobster, but the risotto had a good amount of lobster pieces. It wasn't too dense and was a great start to the rest of the dinner. We scarfed down the oysters, crab claws, and shrimp so fast it was almost embarrassing. We ordered more oysters not long after our food was served haha. The shrimp was less than impressive - you got one jumbo shrimp with the shrimp cocktail sauce. I would have rather gotten two oysters for that. The crab claw was tasty as well, and took a little longer to eat after cracking them open. The oysters came with two sauces, which I can't recall at the moment. They bring slices of lemon and I just ate the oysters with that since they really did not need anything else.   I'd be interested in coming back for the regular menu, for a special occasion since it is pricey. But, I will definitely be back for the happy hour menu - those $1 oysters and lobster risotto."}
{"text":"5 stars but they messed up the reservation. There was an entire bar of people standing around (no sitting room) waiting for tables for which they made RESERVATIONS. Pretty tempted to mention the Seinfeld episode haha...   It is their fault. They accept too many reservations.   But the food and service...  Wow. Our server Ray was fantastic. I would recommend requesting his service. Welcome to Cleveland Ray! And chef...  Your food is incredible."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Cleveland for happy hour!  $1 Blue Point oysters $2 HUGE shrimp cocktail $5 martinis...I mean it can't be beat.  Not to mention my go to grilled salmon Caesar salad that is delicious and only $7 at happy hour.  Make sure to stop by 3-6:30 mon-fri or all day Sunday!!!  Almost forgot the lobster risotto...so creamy and chunks of lobster!  Yum"}
{"text":"Nice and a classy place for a good fine dining experience. Enjoyed the fabulous selection of wines and food selections .The service is excellent and everyone is very nice. Would highly recommend this place.  Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"Food was great, went here the weekend before V day, they had a $100 full course deal and we took it, definitely not disappointed, good eating!"}
{"text":"Not sure how anybody could give this place 3 or even 4 stars.  I have been going here for years and am never, ever disappoints.  Stopped in this evening after checking out our new Public Square.  We were just going to have apps., but my partner decided on the salmon dinner.  I stayed with the apps, but had 2,  the shrimp cocktail and pork belly.  Everything was amazing.  We ate at the bar and our bartender was fantastic, and knowledgeable about any and all of our food and drink questions..   Wonderful food, a beautiful space, excellent service and not overpriced.  We are lucky to have Blue Point in our city."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I'm spoiled when it comes to seafood, favouring visits to Seattle and Japan/HK to get my fixes.  That said, Blue Pointe is in the top tier in Cleveland when it comes to western style seafoods.  I'd love more oyster choices, and perhaps a bit more in terms of fish selection as well.  But the decor, service and seasoning is spot on."}
{"text":"passing through town just randomly hit up this spot for dinner.  it was fantastic.    I got the seafood chowder to start and it was a 4 out of 5 stars, very good.  got two main courses to try: 1.  NAG'S HEAD GROUPER ~ Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Chive Velout√©, Braised Baby Spinach.  it was very good, i would recommend it to anyone who loves grouper.   2.  GRILLED SWORDFISH ~ Peas, Caramelized Vidalias, Gnocchi, Smoked Tomato Vinaigrette.  this was absolutely phenomenal.  best swordfish i have ever hand and it's not even close.  they served it grilled and a little blackened.    i was pretty shocked how good the fish was.  maybe i caught the Chef on a good day.  maybe i happen to get some fresh fish and sit down at just the right time.  i don't know what it was or possibly this place is just really good and i should stop questioning it.  i just didn't think i would eat this well in terms of seafood in the middle of cleveland."}
{"text":"Blue Point was on point. Sounds stupid? Too bad it's accurate. It has great curb appeal, and the decor inside isn't typically my style, but it's fitting. Sat at the booth nearest the server side of the kitchen and I had nearly 20 minutes to myself (she was late.) In that time, the server checked on me enough but without being annoying. I think this balance is likely impossible to achieve given the different ranges of personalities. It clearly takes some intuition and this guy had it.   When my date arrived, we conversed for some time before looking over the menu. I never felt rushed or pressured to get the orders together. She got the scallops and I got the swordfish with the cauliflower puree, greens, and squash. The swordfish was amazing. For those of you that have prepared swordfish before, it tends to be quite irritating. It generally does not have the fat content you're looking for considering it's weight and can easily turn into an arid desert. This was not the case with my swordfish. It was perfectly cooked and quite juicy and delightful. The pairing with the cauliflower puree and greens were a welcome addition, and the combination worked nearly as well as the swordfish alone.  Unfortunately, it was not my night to order the better dinner. The scallops were ridiculously delicious. My date was kind enough to offer me a sampling of her dish, and the scallops simply blew my mind. I have not enjoyed scallops like that for a while and these were as buttery and decadent as I remembered having while living on the coast. Again, scallops tend to be a \"cooker's food\" because if you wait just a smidge too long, the scallops turn to rubber. Perfectly done, and whatever selection of micro greens accompanying them were well placed peppery notes that only enhanced the dish.  Considering the following review, I have to go five stars. I simply would have never believed there is seafood like this in Cleveland. You get what you pay for; something less and less common these days."}
{"text":"Absolute perfection from start to finish.   First, good food starts with good service, and I think we got the best server in the greater Cleveland area. He had genuine answers to all our questions (genuine in that he knew based on experience with a food or drink item rather than repeating what he'd been told to say about it). We took nearly all his suggestions - drinks, appetizers, specials - and were quite happy with the results. Plus, um, he was hot. Yeah, I said it.   We were celebrating, so we went all out: sampler appetizer, entrees all around, four different sides, and dessert. The sampler appetizer (calamari, crab cakes, and dumplings) was enormous - four hungry, happy ladies barely made a dent. As for entrees, I had the Filet Oscar (Filet Mignon and lump crab meat), and it was flawless. I heaped on lobster mashed potatoes and mushroom gnocchi and wished for a larger stomach.   Finally, I don't think you can go to Blue Point without commenting on the beauty of the space itself. Part wide open, part cozy; brass chandeliers and exposed beams. We had a table on the main part of the floor. Through the large windows, I got to watch the sky change to dusk behind Tower City Center as the meal progressed. Like I said earlier, perfection."}
{"text":"Really great service, food and location. Stopped in on Mother's Day without a reservation and they had us seated and took care of us without making us feel like we inconvenienced them whatsoever and even the valets were first class and helped the ladies out of the car, etc. highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE their Happy Hour. Great for dinner too, but their Happy Hour is one of the best around. The Salmon Caesar Salad and Lobster Risotto are great, and the muscles were good too.   I've never had a bad meal here, or bad service. Very accommodating and wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out.  Had a few drinks at the bar and did some people watching.  I am looking forward to going back to eat.  The menu looked awesome!  Love the seafood options."}
{"text":"Here for happy hour.  $8 for half dozen Blue point.  Exceptional wine selection.  Oysters very fresh.  Satisfied."}
{"text":"First visit.  Coming  back ASAP.  Overly impressed with food,  service and meal.  Please excuse me as I sample Creme Brule with salt caramel chocolate ice cream.   See ya in the obituaries,  smiling."}
{"text":"Ambience is classy and comfy. Service is also good. The servers know their food. Curry Chicken Spring Roll (Day's Special) - Very Good Grilled Shrimp - Good Grilled Grouper - Very Good Herbed Walleye - Good Creme Brule - Very Good Chocolate Cake - Good. Not very sweet but very chocolaty."}
{"text":"Pull up to the valet and get a nice welcome, then the door opened for you and the hostess has a big smile and also says hello. Our table was being cleaned so we walked into the bar for a cocktail. Dirty martini up with a couple bleu cheese stuffed olives. The hostess came to the bar and said the table was ready. We got a high energy welcome from Joe, he was very nice and went over specials and we asked for his opinion on a few things. The place isn't to big, very nice and everything was good. They have a big Oyster selection so I couldn't resist. Chaser salad to start and surf and turf for dinner. It was prepared perfectly. We had a great time and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"This upscale establishment conveniently located at the corner of West 6th and St Claire has an outstanding selection of seafood dishes, but the portions could be a bit larger, at least for my appetite. Aside from that, the service was alert and attentive and the food quality was fantastic. I had thr seared ahi tuna and a glass of San Gioenovese, which paired rather well. I will definitley return to try another selection!"}
{"text":"AWESOME!  I hardly EVER give five stars because I rate on atmosphere, service and the food and it is very difficult to find a place that lives up to or exceeds my expectations.  My husband and I were both ecstatic on having found somewhere where we could sit and have a nice meal without screaming kids and/or loud, inconsiderate people.  Our waiter was great and the food was excellent.  It seems like they actually cared that we were happy with our food.  If we ever get back this way, I would not hesitate to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I joined 3 friends for an early dinner at Blue Point Grille on Jan. 23, 2016.  The comfortable seating arrangements (tables not too close to each other) allowed for plenty of space for all diners.  The server was really good at her job, making us feel really comfortable and explaining questions we had about entrees.  Each of us had an appetizer and all were very fresh and enjoyable. The bread is served crispy on the outside and nice and warm and soft on the inside.  It's made by Breadsmith, a Lakewood, OH local bakery.  Lots of honey-butter was served with our bread, and it was not too sweet--just right.  I had a 12 oz. strip steak which was not done quite enough for my taste, so it was quickly taken away to be cooked a bit more.  I was immediately provided with 3 large shrimp with cocktail sauce served on a bed of crushed ice so I had something to eat (at no cost to me) while my friends ate their entrees.  This simple yet thoughtful gesture (providing me something to nibble on while I waited for my steak to be cooked a bit more) was a first-class touch.  My steak came back quickly, cooked a bit more and perfect for my tastes.  (I would much rather send a steak back to be cooked a bit more than to get it overdone.) The asparagus and roasted, small Klondike rose potatoes that accompanied my steak were excellent.  The demi-glaze that came with my steak was the best I've had.  Overall, my experience was pretty wonderful."}
{"text":"amazing food and service at blue point. We felt like seafood and looked up this place on Yelp. With the many positive reviews we decided to try it. Although a bit pricey the food was well presented and prepared. I had the shrimp and scallops and my friend had the blue point heaven....both outstanding meals. We were full so didn't have desert. This place is pretty nice and proper attire is required.  For less pricier drinks head across the street to bar Louie for a night cap."}
{"text":"Not a 5 star restaurant except for our waitress. First off, dress your best (suits, pants, dresses) or expect to get some dirty looks & fake services from those standing at the front desk. It was our 10 years anniversary. And, we were in town to have a good time, attend an outdoor concert, & to possibly see fireworks. We dressed appropriately for that occasion, but did not expect the restaurant would have a sign that says \"proper acquire required.\" The interpretation of that sign can be numerous according to each individual anyways. In our defense, they did not state any of this on their website. I called earlier & made reservation since it is our anniversary. The 5 stars online is what made us stop by.. We pride ourselves in being humble & down to earth even though we do have the means to flaunt it, but we don't. The looks & bickering that we got when entering that restaurant.. the fake greeting was beyond obvious.. I am sick to my stomach to think that people are that judgmental & materialistic on first impressions. Don't judge a book by it's cover, because you have NO IDEA who they really are.. 2nd of all- food. We ordered appetizers (calamari, crab cakes, salads), entrees (filets, salmons, some other fish, & lobsters), desserts: (Creme Brulees, Chocolate Quartets(came with chocolate torte, cheesecake, chocolate souffl√©s, expresso cake, served with vanilla ice cream))- all were \"ok\" or simply not good. For about the same price range- Flemings Steakhouse would've been a way better choice or Cheesecake Factory! This place is nowhere near those levels for food, quality, or atmosphere! Highly overrated & completely disappointed. The only positive thing I can say is- the seafood: the salmon & crab meat (cake) did tasted \"fresh.\""}
{"text":"One of the very best meals I have ever had on Friday night. Scallops for appetizer, Lobster Bisque soup and roasted Grouper with lobster mashed potatoes and spinach. Every bite was so delicious. Our waiter, Dave was terrific too. Suzanne and I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Loved it. It's in an old building and I like the brick walls. We had oysters as an appetizer and I had the Ahi Tuna as an entree. Great service, food and an excellent wine list."}
{"text":"It was a good restaurant, good service. The scallops were the best plate out of the appetizers and the tuna tartar as well, but it didn't blow my mind. We tried the crab cakes and they didn't do it for me.... The lobster bisq however was amazing (a little high in salt) ..... What I do recommend is when going in groups you should order the mega raw platter.... It brought a lot of crab legs and oysters and lobster and clams..... I thought it was a great deal....   I tried the lobster mash and even though some people liked it I thought it lacked flavor....   Desserts wise we tried the crime br√ªl√©e, that was really good (even though it was cold inside as they usually serve it in the states) the s'mores was alright...   Overall it was a nice restaurant but the food didn't really blow me away"}
{"text":"I'm delighted to have tried this place.  I'm more of a carnivore but felt I needed to get some seafood and Blue Point hit the spot.  Prices for the dishes are at the higher end but still quite reasonable.  I had the Caesar salad which was very good but I'll ask them to omit the black olives next time.  Attractive presentation, too.  My main dish was the blackened swordfish and it hit the spot. The space is open and bright and not at all noisy.  Definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"We were seated right away, we had a reservation. The wait staff was fantastic; they kept our water filled at all times. The scallops as an appetizer were delicious as was the lobster bisque. I had the salmon on the simple menu. It was a bit dry from the grill, and the roasted potatoes were boring. The pound cake was dry and the rhubarb compote looked and tasted disgusting."}
{"text":"Solid seafood restaurant! Came for lunch, and the food and service were pretty good. We got an order of the mussels for the table, and those were awesome! Also, the free bread is very good as well and is perfect for sopping up all of that good mussel broth. I got the filet Oscar, which was tasty, however what they describe as lump crab on the menu is more like little itty bits of crab- I expected a little higher quality crab for a restaurant dedicated to seafood. Also, a couple of people in our group got the lunch express special where you pick a soup, fish, and salad I think? The soups (clam chowder and lobster bisque) were on point, but the portions of fish and salad were tiny!! Definitely not equivalent in portion size to the other entrees on the menu. Overall, decent dining experience!  On another note, I have been here for happy hour as well which is awesome!! I'd definitely return for happy hour- not sure about a full on meal though."}
{"text":"I am sooo tired of people giving Blue Point good recommendations and treating it like its the best thing since sliced bread.  It's a real waste of money.  If you want to have a real night on the town, you are better off going to XO, Crop, Lola, or one of the restaurants in Tremont/Ohio City.  I've only been there two or three times but I never got a single dish that I'd rate as great or exceptional.  Given their exceptional prices, I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"Blue Point Grille was everything I read about. The food was amazing! I had the Walleye and my husband had the Oscar filet. Both meals were soo good! The fish was breaded lightly to perfection. The lobster sauce over the filet mignon was delicious. Now let's  talk about service. Our server was Dave. He was so accommodating. We decided to go with all his recommendations and were not disappointed! Dave made the experience 5 star! Really Blue Point Grille is my all time favorite seafood restaurant! Thanks Dave!"}
{"text":"Good food.. But a little on the pricey side. I had salmon which was around $25. Normal price I guess and my fianc√© had the same. What threw us off was the 2 crab cakes that were so small and that was $16. (Appetizer) Save for a special occasion:) good food though! Lots of seafood options. Customer service was great."}
{"text":"I've been to Blue Point for dinner and lunch many times, but never for Happy Hour.  Let's just say, this was my first time, but certainly not my last. First of all, I LOVE an upscale Happy Hour, the idea of great food and drink at a discount, sign me up!  Blue Point did not disappoint.  first of all, Happy Hour starts at 3:00pm....oh yeah!  I arrived, seated myself at the bar and was immediately greeted by bartender, Halle.  She could not have been nicer and more attentive, my water glass was never empty and dishes were removed, as soon as I finished the meal.  I proceeded to order the lobster risotto and chilled crab claws, along with the Blue Point Cosmo cocktail.  The crab claws arrived first, huge claws, perfectly chilled atop crushed iced, accompanied by a seasoned mayo dipping sauce....yummy!  The risotto arrived a short time later, warm, creamy and delicious, nice portion too!  To complete the experience, Halle brought over a hot towel w/lemon for handwiping.  I'll absolutely return....soon!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for work/dinner meetings. The atmosphere is wonderful. The food is genuinely great, to say the least. I am not a seafood lover, so I had a steak. It melts in your mouth like butter. The sides were quite delicious as well. I look forward to going there again."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner on Saturday at 7.30 we had great seating in the upper dinning area.Our waiter was perfect our drinks were refilled at the right time never a empty glass .We had oysters and scallops for a appetizer beet salad and for main course lobster with lobster mashed potatoes the dinner and wait staff were perfect .Food was hot and done proper waiter was attentive and well informed.It was a perfect dinning experience .We look forward to a return trip."}
{"text":"Great views, good food. I really didn't think this place was worth 5 stars, yet for me that is a rare find these days. First the location is great, downtown within walking distance to a lot of great places. The place is noisy and the tables packed together, making it a little difficult to get to your table or have a conversation. The oysters, were oysters and the Calamari was prepared the same as every where else. I tried the Pecan Encrusted Walleye with Brussel Sprouts. I liked the Brussel Sprouts, the fish was mushy.   Nice place, but no big deal"}
{"text":"Many of my friends recommended this restaurant to me as one of the best in Cleveland and I wanted to try it out. I made a reservation for dinner and the great service started immediately as we walked in. The staff offered to take coats and we were quickly seated in a spacious booth with wonderful ambiance all around.   After our waitress greeted us she began to go over the wine list and gave us recommendations of her favorite. She also asked if we were in any time constraint or had a show to attend to make sure she could get us there in time. She mentioned that she heard we were celebrating an anniversary (which was true) and wished us a happy one. This was a small, but thoughtful touch. Throughout the night there were many small touches that made a very positive impact on our experience. We received many awesome recommendations from our waitress, our wine glasses were always full, as were our water glasses, and crumbs were even scraped from the table once we finished eating so we could enjoy our wine. I ordered a prime sirloin steak which was amazing and too much to finish. It was cooked perfectly just as I ordered. You also receive bread to snack on before the meal comes.   At the end of dinner we were given a complimentary dessert in honor of our anniversary. I would definitely recommend this restaurant, especially for special events. You will be in great hands of the staff and they will make sure to take care of you and ensure a great experience."}
{"text":"I am SO loyal to Pier W that it pains me to say that Blue Point gives it a run for its money, but I need to give credit where credit is earned & deserved. The inside is so elegant with huge white pillars, exposed brick and massive gold chandeliers. I was in awe at the ambiance and so ecstatic to find that  food matched the beautiful interior!! I ordered the salmon entree and my fiance ordered the crab cakes. Both were cooked to perfection, packed with the perfect amount of flavor/ freshness and so succulent. I love seafood and I am so excited to say I have found another go to spot for it even closer to m apartment than Pier W."}
{"text":"In Cleveland, there can't possibly be a better place for Oysters or seafood. Head for the bar during happy hour and not only do you get an amazing bargain like blue point oysters for a buck to start, but the bartenders are amazing and make you feel at home. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Awesome oysters. Slow service but friendly. Go here!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group. Amazing fish entrees and nicely sized portions. Upscale atmosphere and dining; the higher price point was well-earned through the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"Very expensive but worth the pleasure! Cocktails are expertly prepared by knowing Mixologists!  Started with a dozen oysters on the half shell, topped with horseradish and cocktail sauce...followed by a sip of vodka each.  The Price Fixe Menu is wonderful for big eaters...my man enjoyed his Lobster Bisque...said it was the best he has ever eaten! Look how pretty too. The Scallops...could have had a couple more, but perfectly prepared and finished with the Key Lime Pie tart!  I enjoyed the sweet Pecan Crusted Walleye (Cleveland caught) and the Bacon-Sweet Potato Brussel Sprout hash.  Have you ever experienced your tongue dancing with flavors? Mine did!  This is a cool spot to people watch and be seen! But bring your credit card..I don't usually carry $200+ cash... ok if you don't drink, you should be cool!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. The waiters were very nice and helpful. Try the bluepointe haven probably the best dish there. Not the cheapest place but not the most expensive. Enjoy the great service and food"}
{"text":"Dirty bathroom, food sat under heat lamp, service was attentive and crab risotto was decent."}
{"text":"I've been here twice- both for nicer occasions when family was in town. I would say that this is the perfect place for that type of event- nicer, not rowdy, great food, and pricey. I got the grouper fish both times and it was consistently great. The waiters are knowledgable and were helpful with wine pairings. They give you this warm bread before your meal that is really delicious. This isn't the kind of place that I'd stop at on my way home from work, but it's a safe go to if you want to take someone somewhere nice and classy."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for our two year anniversary. Drinks to start - she got one of their signature cocktails and I got an old-fashioned. She liked hers and mine was very well made. Lamb spring rolls for an appetizer - a little tart, but we enjoyed them. She got the shrimp + scallops + potatoes - she loved every bite. I got the lobster bolognese - I could eat this for days and never get sick of it. Great atmosphere and our waitress was attentive."}
{"text":"We were reluctant to eat seafood in Cleveland but our concerns were put to rest after the first course. We started with the shrimp cocktail which is presented uniquely in that the sauce and the horse radish are separate enabling patrons to choose the \"heat factor\". The waitress described the lobster bisque as liquid gold, and she was right. It was savory despite being lighter than most.   I had the filet oscar with Brussels sprouts.  Everything was prepared as requested. The sprouts were delicious despite not being overly greasy (which is common for that dish). You can't go wrong with Blue Point Grill."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check this place out, even though a couple friends of ours said it was overrated.   The seafood we got was actually very good, in fact the scallop appetizer were possibly the best I've ever had.  I would have loved to get more than 3 quarter sized pieces for the 19 dollars I spent.  At least make it 4 so we can split the meal properly.  I should have stuck with seafood but I got sucked into one of their \"daily specials\" some 10 day dry aged delmonico ultra 5000 steak ( I've got no idea the man rambled on for 20 minutes describing it)  To try and be realistic, imagine getting an $80 steak at  a restaurant, and it tastes worse than what you can make at home, hell even worse than a longhorns steak.  It was ordered medium rare, it came medium well, and had such a bad burn on the outer side it was like a hockey puck.  My wife's filet was very tough as well.  That was $65.  My point is when you spend $200+ for 2 at a restaurant, the food needs to be spectacular.  It was far from.  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time with two other guests celebrating my mom's birthday! Grouper, Filet, Lobster Bisque and Calamari were perfectly done!"}
{"text":"Overall, nice place, but could use some updating on the interior. Went there for Father's Day, and the service was friendly and on top of everything. We ordered the calamari (good) and I ordered the Shrimp and Scallops, which was pretty good, but a somewhat small portion, but good nonetheless. Definitely a nice/pricey seafood spot in downtown Cleveland, would recommend."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque was amazing.  The entrees were delicious.  The staff was awesome! We will be going back"}
{"text":"Evening started off great. Super waitresss, loved my wine and my husband was given extra olives for his martini.  My bass was phenomenal and my husband was enjoying his steak served Oscar style until  a bug crawled out of his crab meat.  It was so nasty.    The waitress took our dishes away as soon as we got her attention.  The manager came over to tell us how embarrassed he was.  They offered to make us new meals, which we refused.  How could we eat anything from that kitchen.  The manager told us that they would take care of our meal, but did not offer us any other compensation.  It was just so disappointed and dirty.'"}
{"text":"We went out for our Anniversary and our waiter Sean was very good and helpful. I have to say tho the two women at the front desk were very smug and had no purpose but to give off a I don't give a damn about you look on their faces. They didn't greet us warmly or when leaving, just gave us a dirty look. After spending the amount of money that we spent I think we deserved a good evening and a smile.  Not too much to ask, especially in the service industry!!!"}
{"text":"Love it.  Yum.  Dinner,  lunch,  happy hour.  Wish I could remember my bartenders name.  I asked for the manager when I left and said this is the kind of person anyone wants working in their restaurant.  He was kind,  fun and really really knowledgeable.  Wish I had written my review sooner so I could mention him by name"}
{"text":"Great place to impress. A little pricey, but the oysters are amazing. Have to love it! Gotta have it! Need some more... Will be back! This place is seafood at its finest!!!"}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced.  While the service is decent it is far from exceptional.  The same goes for the food.  The shrimp were rubbery, and the filet mignon was certifiably gummy.  Though the lobster and crab cake were fairly good; I don't think it would be hard to find these at a similar quality level for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Tonight we tried Blue Point Grille and let's just say it was better than expect. Slightly upscale, gracious staff and wonderful food. Ordered from the summer fixed prix menu and got a bargain."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I have never been disappointed. I think of this place as a Cleveland gem. If your not from the area and want a classy dinner you must go here."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed dinning at the Blue Point Grille.  As someone from New England, good quality seafood is hard to find.  The Blue Point Grille came pretty close."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now for happy hour, which is from 4-6, and the food is awesome!  Great prices and friendly, helpful bar tenders.  The host staff is extremely snooty and will look at you like you're a piece of trash walking in, or just not acknowledge you at all, but other than that, it's a great experience.  I will keep coming back for happy hour.  :)"}
{"text":"I went to Blue Point Grille a while back before seeing \"Wicked\" when it was in town. I definitely recommend making a reservation because it's usually full, especially on the weekends.   We sat upstairs which I enjoyed because you're able to look down and see the entire restaurant. Our service was great and our water glasses were never empty.   I started with the Caesar Salad which I thought was great, especially because they added a twist and put kalamata olives on top. For my entree, I had the scallops.  I believe that the truffle brown butter really made the scallops shine in this dish. It was paired with some other vegetables that accented the scallops well.   If you have a special occasion coming up or have a reason for a great dining experience, i'd recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Blue Point Grille is a great seafood place in Cleveland! It's on the expensive end, but it's definitely worth it. The atmosphere is very classy and the food is of the highest quality. Would definitely return if I had the chance!!"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful, and the wait staff really knew what they were talking about.  I've had numerous dishes at BPG, and my favorite by far was the salmon.  My least favorite was the steak, it was completely over cooked, and was dry, but I guess that is what I get for ordering a steak at a seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"We visited Blue Point Grille on Saturday, September 19th. We made reservations for 7:30. We got there a little early so we could sit at the bar and have a drink. The bar tender was fantastic and made a great dirty martini.   We were seated just as we ordered our second martini. Or server Kim was outstanding. She made great recommendations and stopped us from over ordering apps. We started with the Lobster Bisque and 8 Blue Point Oysters. Kim recommended we split the soup. It was unbelievable. Thick, rich, and the lobster was tender and tasty. The oysters were so tender. The were perfect!!   For our entrees, we ordered the Filet Oscar and Blue Point Heaven (I think that was the name). The filet was cooked perfectly medium and the crab was delicious. The Blue Point Heaven included a lobster tail, scallops and shrimp. All were cooked perfect and delicious. For sides, we got the lemon and crab risotto (YUM) and lobster mashed potato (a little disappointing - the were cold which Kim tried to fix very quick by bringing out another plate - the were only slightly warm).        The atmosphere was great. We were pretty close to the table next to us but it wasn't too bad. All in all a great dining experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Standard menu, exceptional service and quality. We made a last minute reservation for my husband and our two toddlers. It was a special occasion for us and we asked for a view of Terminal Tower. They sat us in the best spot in the house. The service was exceptional as was the food. There was nothing creative or inventive, just high-quality food from what you would expect from Blue Point. Our *toddlers* got free dessert for being \"More clean and well-behaved than most of the adults here.\""}
{"text":"We came here after spending the day at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum and I have to admit that it was really good. The seafood chower, Scallops, Salmon, and steak were really damn good. Wasn't sure what to expect from the Cleavland eating scene but it was a nice surprise that it was a pleasent one. We topped off this great meal with a slice of Key Lime Pie and the Torte. YUMMMMY! We plan on visiting this restaurant again whenever we are on town next."}
{"text":"Brace yourselves, a lot going on here. On the day before Valentine's Day, I took my gf out to Blue Pointe Grill for her birthday to enjoy the happy hour as she loves shellfish. We arrived, sat at the front of the bar and wasn't even acknowledged by the bartender. We put in an order after flagging her down and she gave us this look like we just did something wrong. I mean c'mon, it was my gf's birthday.  The food arrived (as pictured) which we enjoyed however the bartender never followed up after the food was delivered by someone from the kitchen. She literally asked the 3 other couples at the bar if they needed anything, but skipped us. She never even asked us once if we needed anything (more water, drinks, food, napkins, etc.), and acted as if she overlooked us somehow (again we were at the front of the bar) when we had to flag her down for the bill. Her rudeness and disregard ruined this entire experience for me and my gf.... but that wasn't even the worse of it!  About 13 hours later, on Valentine's Day, my gf started violently throwing up and spent the following 3 days in bed with a high fever and food poisoning. Poor girl couldn't eat or drink water for a couple days. Even after the vomiting subsided, she still has massive heartburn and just today started feeling healthy enough to start catching up on everything that this made her fall behind on."}
{"text":"I was part of a large group dinner at Blue Point Grille, and I think the restaurant delivered on its goal of being \"Cleveland's premier seafood restaurant.\"    For a starter, the large Chilled Seafood Tower is a sight to behold featuring two whole lobster and a bountiful scattering of cocktail shrimp, oysters, mussels, and crab legs.  The lobster and the crab legs come cut and divided for easy sharing (though still put together on the tower for presentation purposes).  As an appetizer course this seemed much more than enough to cover eight people--it probably could work for a group of 10 or even 12.  My only complaint among the items included in the tower were the oysters, which, at least for that night, were on the small side.  For a soup, the Seafood Chowder was decent, utilizing fresh ingredients.  In two spoonfuls I had problems with what appeared to be part of a fish bone or a crab part, so be on the lookout.  I would probably opt for one of the other soups or salads on a future visit.  The Lake Superior Trout for an entree was excellent--served on a bed of truffle gnocchi, shrimp, and shitake mushrooms.  The fish was good on its own, but the gnocchi added a lot to the dish in a place where usually some variation of rice would be found.  And while the gnocchi added substance, the shrimp accentuated the taste of the trout.  I thought this was a really well put together entree and, in addition to the pure spectacle and indulgence of the seafood tower, was my main reason for the four star rating.  Service is polite and about what one would expect from a nicer downtown restaurant.  I do recommend trying to get a table near the big windows in the front to enjoy the view of West 6th and downtown.  The bar also features a number of really good signature cocktails--it's a great spot even if you are just looking to grab some drinks."}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with Blue Point! From the moment you walk in the door until the second you leave, IMPECCABLE guest service. The waiters know the menu inside & out, including the extensive wine list & you will never have an empty glass. I'm a huge fan of the crab cakes & the grouper here & almost never switch it up...maybe next time! ;) lol My boyfriend loves the lobster & the presentation on some of these dishes (like the lobster) is impressive! This has to be the best seafood restaurant in Cleveland hands down. If you're looking for an incredible dinner this is the place to come."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Food is fresh and outstanding. The Time out of Mind specialty drink was good."}
{"text":"Went for oysters, right?  So wrong, the oysters were the smallest we have ever seen. The lobster and heaven dinner was excellent as well as the lobster mashers.  Don't fall walking out as you leave. I fell flat on my knees since the step is just too close to the door. The valets saw me fall and came to my rescue and said it happens all the time. Fix this or someone will sue you."}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch. We all ordered off of the Spa menu (450 calories or less). It was very fresh and healthy.  We ordered: Ahi Tuna - perfect Salmon Sea Bass  They came with rice and steamed broccoli. For around $20.  We also ordered the tomato bisque and someone got lobster bisque - TO DIE FOR!!  They were very accommodating about gluten allergies as well :)"}
{"text":"First of all, 5/5 for service. Nick embodied every characteristic that a server should have. He was extremely knowledgable about the menu, friendly, prompt, and gave plenty of recommendations. We otherwise wouldn't have known the difference between east and west coast oysters! I would recommend sampling the oyster platters and/or trying the weekly wild caught oyster offerings. They are unique to this venue and were a treat! This restaurant prides its menu on seafood selection and each and every dish that we ordered, was fresh, flavorful and unique. I selected the halibut with orange reduction and rice pilaf, which was incredibly smooth in texture and flawlessly white in color. I enjoyed every aspect of our meals. Parking across the street in the parking would be your best bet, when dining here. The valet lot is very small, and is normally filled to capacity."}
{"text":"Is it fair to give a place 5 stars just for their happy hour? Because I just did.  I haven't had a real meal here but that's okay because their HH might as well be.    First off, its almost every day so its hard to miss (Mon-Fri 3-6:30, and Sunday 5-9). Everything on their bar menu is half off, and everything I've had has been great.  That would include the mushroom gnocchi, beer battered walleye, salmon ceasar, and lobster&shrimp roll.  The best was the walleye. The ambiance is nice and the bar is actually nice and spacious to sit down at to eat.  Great spot to stop by after work with a couple friends and wind down the day with a good meal and few drinks."}
{"text":"The last time I went to the Blue Point Grille was over ten years ago. My impression was high prices and ok food. I finally made a return visit since I was looking for good seafood in downtown Cleveland. The dining area is classy and a bit trendy. It is not very accessible for people with limited mobility. The menu is diverse with both seafood and other entrees. We had a group of seven and ordered the raw bar tower. A bit pricey would be more appropriate for four. Many restaurants have iceberg salads that are a meal alone. Ironically, for an iceberg salad called titanic, the salad is an appropriate dinner side salad. The beet salad is large and excellent. The variety of seafood we sampled was fresh and well prepared. Portion sizes led to some food going home with us. They have a three course dinner special which is a good deal if you like the entrees. You will likely be taking the dessert home. The bar selections and after dinner drinks are extensive. The serve absinthe table side in the classic manner. Service was attentive and timely. There are many good restaurants in Cleveland that may not feature seafood, but certainly offer equally good or superior quality seafood entrees for the same or lower price."}
{"text":"I've lived in Cleveland for a long time and Blue Point has been on my list of places to try for a long time.  Why did I wait so long?  We had a wonderful time.  Four of us went to celebrate a birthday and everything was perfect.  Make it easy on yourself and book a reservation online.  We walked in and immediately went to our table.  Our server was fantastic, not too stuffy and not too casual.  Our drinks were tasty and delivered without delay.  We started off with a few appetizers:  tuna wontons and mussels.  Everyone agreed they had wonderful flavor.  For the main course, we couldn't resist My Blue Heaven, a trio of lobster, scallops, and shrimp.  Scrumptious!  They definitely know how to do seafood here.  Somehow after all of this we managed the chocolate sampler.  I'm so glad we did, because it was out of this world.  Overall, we had a wonderfully relaxed evening of conversation and delicious seafood!"}
{"text":"We went to the Blue Point thinking that it would be a great start to our traditional visit to the Cleveland Orchestra's Christmas concert.  I was pretty disappointed in the food.  Two of us had steak and two had seafood.  The food came out cold (ok, cool), the steak was WAY too salty (which, of course, made me a little salty given what we paid) and the lobster was tough (who has to cut lobster?).  The service was pretty good and the ambiance was nice, but considering I paid more for that meal than any I've ever bought, I'd say it was far from a good value!! I guess that next year, it's back to Pier W!"}
{"text":"Service was great, all staff was very attentive. I ordered one of the specials- surf and turf, which was a filet and shrimp. Both were cooked well but were underwhelming considering it is a steak and seafood place. They do have amazing Brussels sprouts"}
{"text":"So I came here for their Restaurant Week dinner menu, which turned out to be a pretty good meal!  I ordered the Nag's head grouper as my appetizer, which was served over their Lobster mashed potatoes.  The fish was tender and juicy, and the mashed potatoes were rich and buttery.  Overall a fantastic starter.  My entree was the Crab topped filets.  To be honest, I was a bit disappointed, as I had ordered this entree mainly to avoid eating a repeat of either mashed potatoes or fish (the other two entrees offered had either mashed potatoes or fish in them).  However, the filets still came with a bed of mashed potatoes.  It was a bit of potato overload for me.  On the other hand, the filets themselves were cooked medium rare, as I liked, and were quite tender.  My dessert was the chocolate bomb, a round chocolate cake with a molten center served with vanilla ice cream.  Tasty, although not something I would consider the highlight of the meal.  The service was quite good;  our waitress was as hospitable as could be and even asked us to eat our bread while it was still warm!  The environment may not be quite as trendy as other restaurants in the area, but it had large windows with a nice view of the Warehouse District.  So I'd say I had an enjoyable meal during restaurant week, well worth the $30 price tag."}
{"text":"This place has an elegant atmosphere especially if you get to sit on the second floor.  They have valet parking for 8$.  I really enjoyed the salmon though I did send it back to be cooked through a bit more, but the accompanying risotto with citrus/lemon flavors was delicious.  Their bread and butter are also memorable.  The creme br√ªl√©e was small and rich, but good.  Nice place for when you want to celebrate an occasion."}
{"text":"I never had a bad meal here. The food is top notch. The flourless torte is awesome for desert. I have had the grouper, seasonal salmon, seasonal lobster tail, and grouper sandwich. Everything is great. Prices are very high so expect to spend a good amount but that is expected as this is known for high class dining. There are not a lot of good seafood restaurants in Cleveland area but this is the best."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland over the weekend, my fish-a-tarian Boss was speaking at Playhouse Square on Friday night. We found ourselves downtown and looking for a pace to eat with several people in our party that was open late. This restaurant was highly recommended by the staff at the theater. I made a reservation for 10:30pm, knowing that they close their kitchen at 11.  During the show, my Boss decided to go over the limit of the show, and we ran right up to 10:15pm. The audience was delighted, but I was eyeballing my watch with concern. I knew that after show, people would want to come back and say hello. My ex-waitress heart sank as the night wore on.  I rang the restaurant and said: EEK! Will you honor our reservation even though we are going to get there at about 10:55pm? They did!  Huge praises to the staff, the chefs, the kitchen team and the pretty blonde hostess/waitress (sorry, I didn't catch her name.)  We had beautiful oysters, fresh gnocchi and perfectly done spinach/mushrooms. The crab cakes were glorious. (& I  am from Maryland, so I'm a bitchy judge of crab cake)  My glass of Willamette Valley wine was the perfect end of the night.  Two of our party got desserts, but I din't try them.   They didn't rush us, although I was aware to get all orders in immediately.  I know they all had their own date night to head off to as well!  My only sadness is that I should have tipped more than 20% for their accommodation, so I was happy to see that Boss threw down a little more cash as we were leaving. Whoever is in charge of this staff, my sincere gratitude to you for a job well done.  We went to sleep dreaming of Blue Point oysters..."}
{"text":"my family and i went here for my birthday last weekend and this is one of the first places in cleveland that i really enjoyed. i moved here from kansas city, which seems to have way better dining as far as im concerned. but blue point grille was absolutely amazing. really nice building, nice atmosphere, it's upscale but not overwhelmingly so. we started out the mussels, i didn't eat much of them because i got the lobster bisque (which was the best i've EVER had), but from what i did taste of the mussels, I was underwhelmed, they were good but not great, also the texture was a bit slimeier than what mussels should be. but i won't complain because i only had 2. my mom got the group and so did my dad and i got the filet oscar. everyone really liked their dish, i tasted the grouper and it was really good, it had a very buttery taste to it, but it was still light and not fishy at all. my filet was perfect and the crabmeat was the real deal, lump crab, not the miniscule claw meat. overall everyone loved their meals and we left happy, i definitely recommend this place to anyone who is seeking out some seafood and nice dining experience. the service was also on point, very little waiting time between drinks, apps, and entrees; our waiter was very assertive and proactive. i will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks on Friday night 730 Great service by Lisa and good cocktails They do have a specialty cocktails menu Started with the smaller seafood tower which was plenty for three and could have handled four.lobster bisque , tomato bisque both very good but the tomato had blue cheese which I needed to pick out just because Ii do not like. Had the steak Oscar cooked perfectly, friends had scallops. Everything fresh seasoned correctly and delicious 3 people cocktails a couple glasses of wine $240 + tip"}
{"text":"Blue point is definitely my favorite higher end restaurants to eat at downtown. My boyfriend took me there on our anniversary, it was my first time being there and it definitely lived up to my expectations. They gave us one of the best tables in the front corner by the windows which made for a nice view while we ate. Our server was very fast and knowledgable, and super nice. The food was OMG. Probably the best seafood I have ever eaten. We left very satisfied with the overall experience. Everything was just perfect."}
{"text":"I was in town for my birthday and I had my birthday dinner here and had an amazing time! Jason was our server and he was very pleasant and took great care of us! He informed us of the dinner of the night and gave us great recommendations on wine! The food service was fast we didn't wait for long and the meal was to perfection! I'll definitely be recommending this establishment to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"BluePoint was a very nice up-scale find in Cleveland. We were looking for a good hearty meal after a day at the Browns Game. While this was a little fancier than we were looking for, the menu was fantastic, and the seafood did not disappoint.  My pan-seared grouper was light and complimented with asparagus and potatoes. We ordered the oyster sampler and smoked muscles (VERY good) for appetizers and they were delicious. Great food, ok-service (a little slow for a Sunday night), and nice ambiance. I recommend getting a reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"We stopped here for drinks and appetizers before heading over to dinner at another local establishment.   We hung out at the bar, and everyone was able to get in a cocktail or two in the 30-45 minutes we were there. We also tried their oysters, which came with all the fun toppings so you could do yours up with the acid and spice level to your liking. The oysters were fresh and delicious!   Good service, and fresh oysters - not bad for a first stop! Would love to come back here for a full dinner."}
{"text":"I can't rave about this place enough - From the incredible happy hour menu to the BEST bartender in Cleveland, Halle B. Knows me by name and has my drink of choice ready and waiting when I take my seat at her ALWAYS busy (but well-managed) bar. Following the most recent Brown's game we made our way there for a post-game meal...it did not disappoint. The oysters were large and beautifully presented, and both myself and my boyfriend's meals were amazing. This place does not get old and having an amazing staff makes it that much better. Thank you Halle and BPG!!!!"}
{"text":"So, what happened?! I raved about this place to members of my team who hadn't had the fortune of visiting what I perceived to be a really great seafood restaurant when I first ate at BPG. I failed to consider the fact that my original party and I arrived at the restaurant just as it was preparing for the dinner crowd, which may have been the reason the food tasted fresh!  Major fail the second time around:  1) We had to wait for seating for close to 20 minutes even though (a) we had a reservation and (b) the table we were eventually seated at had been empty during our entire wait. The hostesses weren't terribly rude, but they weren't especially hospitable either. 2) Our main course took FOREVER to arrive. This point could be a 50/50 mix of being tired from a long day of meetings, but the comments by my colleagues confirms that I wasn't the only one who felt that our main course took a considerable amount of time following the appetizers to arrive.  3) I ordered the shrimp and scallops dish with asparagus and lobster mashed potatoes (again), but this time EVERYTHING except the asparagus was OVERCOOKED!!!! I was truly disgusted and honestly wanted to send the plate back, but I was also out with work colleagues and to act a fool in public is just not my style. Besides, I never really trust sending a plate back to the kitchen.   The shining light the second time around: Our primary server and the server who poured wine for one of my colleagues. They were courteous, smiling and pleasant.   Oh well, I'm really starting to wonder where the great restaurants are in Cleveland. I know they exist, I'm just hopeful I come across one on my next trip here."}
{"text":"Like this restaurant, classy, busy, great service. The menu is not as extensive as some restaurants but everything we have tried there (one lunch visit and today dinner) has been really good. Today I had a simple salad - good and very fresh, followed by saut√©ed rainbow trout with creamy mashed potatoes and green beans - all prepared perfectly. The entree was $19, definitely reasonable. Had a nice glass of Chardonnay for $7. The bread that come with the meal was fresh, warm and very tasty (hints of Parmesan). All in all, very good!! And then there was the chocolate quintet desert. OMG - delicious and way too much for 2 people but we made a valiant effort!!!"}
{"text":"Reservations needed, I'll start with the appetizers, crab cake was delicious, it's just one and it's small so don't plan on sharing. I had the scallops for my main course and honestly they couldn't have been better prepared, melted in your mouth. In our group for New Year's Eve three people got desert and all raved about it, the cheesecake was mini so again don't bother ordering it and asking for two spoons."}
{"text":"I am sorry that I cannot even give this place two stars. I was entirely disappointed and aggravated for at the quality of food I received for the price I paid.   Started with an appetizer of fresh oysters. Actually pretty delicious.   I ordered the swordfish with veggies. The swordfish came out very dry and the veggies tasted like they were out of a frozen bag and had been microwaved.  My girlfriend ordered the filet (medium well) with mash potatoes. The steak came out rare, an easy fix, but come on. The mash potatoes were very sticky and reminded me of the kind you make out of flakes from a box.   None of the food had any real flavor. The highlight of the night was between the bread and oysters. I walked out about a  $100 poorer and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Cleveland.  $1 oysters, $2 shrimp and $5 Martinis."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch/early dinner before the Yankees v Indians game.  A beautiful corner loft space with exposed brick. Very nice.  The bread was fresh and warm, always a good sign.  We shared the Steamed Mussels in White Wine, Garlic and Tomato as an appetizer. Excellent flavor and freshness.  I had the house specialty, Nags Head Grouper with Lobster Mashed Potatoes and Spinach. Again, excellent flavor and freshness.  My date had the Grilled Salmon with Jasmine Rice and Asparagus. No complaints.  If we're ever back in Cleveland again, we will be sure to dine here again."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for our 1st year Anniversary dinner. Amazing!!! Our server was outstanding, the food was awesome! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I spend one week out of 6 in Cleveland and the food scene is amazing . But all things go considered , the Blue Point is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland .  I always sit at the bar .. The Happy Hour bar menu is what initially attracted me a few years back but the scene at the bar is always fun . Halle who works the bar is so amazing and efficient it is energizing just to watch her watch over the entire bar and make each \"regular\" feel like we're the most important in the restaurant . I'm in hospitality service and it's a very rare person who can accomplish that but Halle does . It is also a window to the new Cleveland . I meet people from all over the U.S. and from other countries and there's always conversation amongst the patrons . I never go to Cleveland without a stop at Blue Point . I wish I could give it 6 stars ."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch, they are quick and efficient with great service. The lobster bisque is awesome and you won't be disappointed. Great atmosphere and in the middle of the Warehouse District which makes it convenient if you are spending time downtown."}
{"text":"2nd visit here.  Food quality was good but the pricing structure for the portion size is a bit crazy. Then, to ask people to pay $75.00 for crab legs is just insane.  Will I return?  Not sure"}
{"text":"The food is great! The service is great! The atmosphere is great!  We came here on New Year's Eve and had a wonderful time. For New Year's Eve, the prices were not bad!! We decided to sit in the lounge area instead of the main restaurant, which turned out to be a great choice. It's darker, quieter, and warmer.  We split the calamari which was very good and I had the chicken. I don't know why I went to a fish place and ordered chicken.. It was good! But I should have stuck to fish!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and can't figure out what the hype is. I live walking distance from this place and it's always full with patrons and I do not understand why. I don't think the food is that great. It's not awful, I've just had better steak and seafood at different places in Cleveland. The wait staff is good, ambiance is not bad, but with so many other amazing food options in Cleveland, I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Blue Point Grille - a must visit place when you come to Cleveland. They had a strong variety of oysters, all deliciously served. My waitress was very good, hospitable, and gave me great advice on what to get on the menu. Wish all my visits to new cities came with such a positive experience!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend on a weekday, so this review may not reflect the restaurant operating on peak performance for a night shift where I feel this restaurant could shine.  I was a bit annoyed when I walked in as even with a reservation, I was seated with another table right next to me (and quite close) even though there were only 3 tables in the restaurant during my early reservation.   Service was fine, though a bit mechanical, and the food selection is exactly what you'd expect at most seafood restaurants. Between the oyster appetizer, shrimp & scallops (my friend's entree), and my gulf of maine salmon, the food was fine but again, not extremely inventive.  Bottom line, I feel Blue Point Grille is a good place for business meetings when you want to ensure you'll have well prepared standard seafood fare at moderate prices in a decent location. Overall though, it can feel like a sterile environment with the restaurant missing the key elements and attention to detail that will make a restaurant a favorite and standby for me."}
{"text":"We started with the oyster sampler, with a mix yourself cocktail sauce and a mignonette. I enjoyed my oysters plain but my companion had trouble flagging someone down to get a lemon wedge.  Also ordered the duck confit hush puppies, they were underwhelming, and a little undercooked.  I ordered the grilled swordfish, with acorn squash puree, broccoli rabe and mushrooms.  The swordfish was a little salty, but cooked perfectly. The broccoli and mushrooms were also excellent. The acorn squash was a little sweet for me, maybe it was suppose to offset the salty fish?  My friend ordered from the special menu I believe Alaskan Halibut. He said it was good, but the fillet was undersized.  He also ordered lobster mashed potatoes, I tried them they were ok, but I'm never really a fan so don't take that as a strike against them."}
{"text":"We came to Blue Point to celebrate the anniversary of my parents. To begin, Blue Point is a great place for a celebration. It has a sophisticated ambiance. If you can, get a table on the right side of the restaurant - it has an open concept, high ceilings, cozy tables and a chic vibe. The left side is OK, but the booth heavy seating dilutes the pretty atmosphere a bit.  If you're looking for a great glass of wine here, you're in business. Blue Point has a wine list that is basically a novel (so many pages). The seafood here doesn't disappoint, either. We splurged and Mom and I had the My Blue Point Heaven, a combo of lobster tail, shrimp, scallops, lobster mashers, green beans. The scallops were perfection...big and juicy and divinely satisfying. My Dad enjoyed had the Grilled Swordfish, which is served with french red rice, swiss chard, pineapple salsa and chimichurri. We loved our meals all-around! I doubt you could order something bad here, as every dish that came out of the kitchen looked fresh, delicious and colorful.  You can always count on Blue Point for an elegant dinner. The staff here is a well-oiled machine. They are attentive, friendly and truly represent what a refined dining experience should look like. You can tell the management cares deeply about what they do! We will be back to Blue Point."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience. We had the tuna tartare, crab cake and salad for appetizer, everything was absolutely the freshest and delicious. We then split the seafood tower and it was fantastic! Crab legs, blue pointe oysters, crab claws and shrimp, smoked mussels and dipping sauce. Joe was our waiter and he was very helpful and friendly without being obtrusive. Would absolutely, totally return."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed by the food here...and I was sick with a stuffy nose.  My friend and I split their salmon with blue crab risotto and their sea bass with truffle gnocchi.  The salmon came out perfectly and was devoured pretty quickly.  The sea bass was served differently from other restaurants -- the skin/bone of the tail was still on so there was a pretty good crisp to it.  The gnocchi had a good amount of truffle oil in it and I would recommend it to anyone that loves their truffle oil.  I'm originally from a coast so I'm used to fresh seafood and I can definitely say that Blue Point is going to be one of my go-to seafood restaurants in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Was not at all impressed. I found the food to be very bland and unremarkable.  Inside looks all jazzy and stuff but for fresh fish in a friendly, laid-back environment, I cannot recommend Mitchell's Fish Market in Eton enough."}
{"text":"My first time in Cleveland and a friend refers me here.  I'm not big on seafood, but I've been wanting to try crab cakes so I gave it a chance.  ABSOLUTELY delicious. Flavorful and beautifully displayed.  My waiter was awesome.  Very patient and helpful.  I will definitely be back whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"I think our waiter must have had a bad day because he failed to notice that our drink glasses were empty.  Then, when we asked him for refills on our wines and our water, he grumbled.  It was perplexing because I thought they wanted their customers to spend more money?  They have a very solid selection of wines by the glass.  It isn't often that your find a Gamay by the glass but they had it, plus other interesting selections.  The crab cakes were very nicely done with lots of crab meat and not so much filler.  My colleague ordered the lobster bisque.  She let me taste it and it was truly amazing.  It had lots of lobster chunks. My seared tuna was also excellent.  Rare on the inside and seared on the outside.  I would have given them 5 stars if it hadn't been for the disappointing service."}
{"text":"Great service; amazing food. I had the scallops and my boyfriend had the 1 lb lobster special.  My only compliant is that we called 24 hours in advance and had to take a 530 reservation vs a 630."}
{"text":"Last night was an enjoyable night with my girlfriend at this restaurant! The Kumamoto oysters from the Oyster Sampler was our favorite oysters!!!! We also had crab cakes for an appetizer!!! Parking across the street is only $8.50 or you can valet for $10. The swordfish entree was delicious and so was my lobster pasta!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a holiday dinner with my family. The service was excellent, and the food was fantastic. My dad is a really picky eater and he loved it! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, impeccable service, what else could you ask for?  I loved my experience at Blue Point Grille.  I ordered the Nag's head grouper, which was cooked perfectly.  The lobster mashed potatoes that came with it were rich and creamy and even had chunks of lobster in it.  My girlfriend ordered the salmon, which was delicious and came with the BEST RISOTTO THAT I'VE EVER TASTED!  Our waiter was very nice and even put my lobster mashed potatoes on a separate plate from my grouper so my (lobster-allergic) girlfriend could have a few bites of my grouper :)"}
{"text":"I'm stunned to see anyone give a less than spectacular review. This is one of the best restaurants in downtown Cleveland. They feature the freshest seafood, prepared to perfection. I even brought my dad here, who hates the mere thought of seafood, and he thoroughly enjoyed his meal - so obviously their land animal offerings are great as well. I started with shrimp coctail, which is basic, but was great. Then I had a salad, which was one of the daily specials, and it was one of the best salad I've ever had. For my main entree I ordered the lobster bolognese (i had tried a friends leftovers of this which is why i had been dying to come here in the first place), which is pasta in a delicious creamy tomato based sauce laden with pieces of lobster. They also have a very nice beer and wine selection. In summary, this place is killer!"}
{"text":"Alright,  we like this place, clean nice, seafood, bathrooms are neat!  But what I have a prolum with, is every year we go they tell us to come in November, for seafood crab fest.  Hostesses and management tell us different!   Waiters wait staff, what have you, tell us different!  That is the only downfall, drinks food service is pretty good!  I did get the \" my blue heaven\"  wasn't what I expected,  served with this party chip, kinda like a huge potatoe chip, stail as heck!  Also my wife Odors a dinner every time, amazing!   Lobster bisque a must!  Please get this, if ya don't eat bread, like us, it's still amazing,  when I ate bread it was a must to dip my bread in it, well really I still do, but sparingly!   Drinks are great always very neat, an right on!  Blue point is a must if your are in Cleveland have a seafood bug, and even i it's Sunday!"}
{"text":"Completely forgot to take pictures bc the food was absolutely amazing! You definitely pay for what you get. I got the blackened salmon with the Maryland crab Oscar which comes with potatoes and green beans. I didn't have to add salt/pepper to anything. The salmon was cooked to perfection! My husband had the prime sirloin and added the Maine lobster tail. His sides were the mashed potatoes and spinach with wild mushrooms. His steak was cooked very well! Oh and the margaritas are fantastic! Will definitely be back soon  11/10"}
{"text":"There is a reason this restaurant has the terrific reputation as being Cleveland's best.  The food is excellent, as was the service by Laura.  Prices are fair."}
{"text":"The food is really good, especially the oysters.  It's pretty expensive, but you get what you pay for.  Parking is a non issue, there's plenty across the street and they provide valet service."}
{"text":"Sunday night dinner for two and we couldn't have enjoyed it more.   Waiter was great (Mark) and the manager even stopped by to see how things were.  Started with the oyster sampler.   We love oysters and there were 8 nice oysters of four different kinds.   Unlike some samplers,  you could really tell the difference between each type (brininess, meatiness, shape, etc.)  My wife has the lobster tail and I had the tuna.   Both were excellent,  although there was a little too much salt in the cauliflower puree that bedded the tuna.     Bread / butter was even good with some sort of nice honey infused butter.  And even better - could have possibly the fastest bartender in the midwest.   Ordered a drink and it showed up 30 seconds later.   Nice job!  Definitely recommend for an upscale night out and we would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Upscale excellent seafood.  We had our reservation cancelled the first time we tried to go due to an issue with the grill hood.  They graciously offered some gift cards and we went back on our next visit to Cleveland.   The restaurant is what you would expect for the prices.  High end, good wine list, well stocked high-end bar and great ambiance and great service by Kevin who provided very good recommendations for the oysters, wine, entrees and was just a great waiter.  Based on our meal I can highly recommend the raw oysters and shrimp cocktail for starters and the Ahi Tuna, Lobster Bolognese, and the Crab Cake - although I'm sure everything is very good and fresh.  Ask your waiter -ours was superb."}
{"text":"After walking around the Wharehouse District, a couple of coworkers and I decided to stop in and have dinner after looking at the menu. It's had the typical seafood fare, lobster, scallops, shrimp, crab, etc. As well as some items that I didn't expect, monkfish (one if the nights specials) swordfish, and walleye.  The decor was nice and not too stuffy. The service was good. Our waiter was very prompt and helpful and making menu recommendations. I went with the Saut√©ed Shrimp and Scallops. The three scallops were nicely cooked. They weren't rubbery, and they were nice and big without fat on them. The four shrimp were also nicely cooked. The butter sauce was just enough and added some flavor to the whipped mash potatoes.  It was nice to experience a decent seafood restaurant in the Midwest.  This would be an excellent place for a business dinner or date night."}
{"text":"I've had better...worth giving a shot...the seafood tower was pretty good"}
{"text":"It would be hard to give this place anything less than 5 stars.   Food was excellent ...not sure it can get any better.  For starter, I indulged myself in a mixed green salad with white balsamic dressing.   Probably the most simple, but best salad I ever had.  They also provided freshly homemade/baked bread with a sweet butter (loved it)!  For my entree, I had the fillet oscar...fillet was cooked to my liking topped with a crab that had the perfect balance of sweet and flavor.  I closed the evening with a key lime pie topped with a caramelized coconut custard that was to die for.  Its expensive, but still a great value.  If you ever in Cleveland,  this is a must go!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing resturant.  All we can say is WOW!  We loved it so much we came back 2 nights in a row.  Even though we are from out of town, they treated us like family. The first night I had the Salmon with Crab Risotto and broccolini we give it 5 Stars.  The server, Ken, was friendly, attentive and great suggestions for local activities.  The second night was just as amazing I ordered the Swordfish.  Jackie K. was our server and she was very professional, fun, and friendly. She went out of her way to make our night special! We highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My Norwegian mother-in-law is a born lover of seafood, so my husband and I chose this place for treating her to her annual Christmas-present dinner. We always splurge on her, and this trip was no different. We had cocktails, a nice bottle of wine, digestifs... oh, and a whole lot of sea creatures somewhere in between. Those creatures included the myriad shellfish involved in the seafood tower, two different fish entrees, and my shrimp and scallop dinner over lobster mashed potatoes. Everything was fresh and prepared well. Service was well-paced and friendly. I really like the space. It's been years since we'd been, but we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Took my family to celebrate my wife's 60th birthday.  It had been a very long time since our last visit and we had a fantastic experience.  We had a large party (9) and were seated immediately in the upstairs dining area.  Nick, our waiter, greeted us promptly and gave us some time to settle on drink orders.  After cocktails, had some appetizer's and  the Raw Bar Tower, which had a variety of shrimp, mussels, crab legs and claws etc.  Very good.  The reviews from our table were excellent.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the dinner and service.  Nick did a good job pacing the apps, salads and dinner.  Very comfortable pace, did not seemed rushed, but did not wait either.    Could not have been more pleased."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT. I literally can't say enough good things about Blue Point. Wonderful valet, greeted and seated promptly, our waiter (Nick) was on point and excellent, our meals were AMAAAAAZING, the ambience is wonderful upstairs (intimate). Such a wonderful experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not sure how as a seafood lover from Cleveland I have just now ventured into this classy joint, but I am damn glad I did!  After indulging in some cocktails, raw oysters and ridiculously good calamari at the bar one evening, I was left wanting more and returned for lunch here the following day.  (**Note the fried calamari here was top 5 ever. I prefer my calamari grilled/sauteed of late, but the squid here is crusted in cornmeal, tossed with peppers and sits in some creamy sauce. 5 stars**)  For lunch, I had a tomato bisque with bleu cheese (different and good) and their house specialty, the Nag's Head grouper with lobster mashed potatoes and spinach but requested it blackened.  It arrived seasoned to perfection, fresh, perfectly cooked and divine.  Also, I was impressed that the little chunks of lobster in the mashed potatoes actually had flavor that came through! Awesome.  Will return for dinner the next time in Cleveland to dig further into the menu and try the filet oscar or some lobster.  I have had great dining experiences at Delmonico Steakhouse in Independence, Ohio and apparently this place is owned by the same people. Love it!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful place! Great feel and vibe to it as well. Ate at the bar and had the walleye sandwich. The French fries that come with the sandwich are absolutely excellent - among the best in a long time for me - they are fresh cut. The walleye sandwich was very good . Wouldn't say it was excellent but definitely worthy of 4 stars. One annoying factor was that it came with a jalapeno tartar sauce. This was not mentioned on the menu or by the bartender when I ordered the sandwich . I absolutely HATE when restaurants do not disclose that an item is either spicy, hot or has some other ingredient in it that a customer may not care for. Somehow this new breed of chefs has determined what we should like and they figure that we will eat what they prepare and how they prepare it without exception. Wrong! Be careful if you do come and don't be afraid to ask questions about the menu."}
{"text":"Blue Point is officially my new favorite upscale restaurant downtown. We had the best service all the way through! Ginormous wine list and amazing seafood. We had one of the seafood towers to start and I was shocked at how fresh it all was! The lobster mash is AMAZE.  The only thing I wouldn't order again is the Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars - I have to say, the food here is better than I expected.  Its not really unique and they don't stray much from the path of a seafood restaurant, but the execution is pretty solid.  I got the salmon, and it was cooked perfectly.  I enjoy eating the skin, but many places don't cook it properly...not this place.  It was delicious and probably the most memorable thing about the meal.  Its a bit cramped inside,  and the noise level was a bit high for this type of restaurant.  Also, the service was a bit slow.  So, all in all, a good experience, but I am not sure I can say definitively that I will be back."}
{"text":"I went here once for a business outing. Bring your sports jacket. You can't just Phil Collins it in here.  We kinda screwed this place over. When we made reservations for 30 people, we assumed we wouldn't be driving by 100 restaurants, so we lost half of our group to other places...also we were about 20 minutes late because we underestimated how long it would take to round up businessmen who'd just spent 6 hours on a bus.  They were rightfully annoyed and the hostess thought we were freaks, but they handled it with grace and the food was really good.   I had the Winter Flounder and it was perfect. It was bedded on some uber-haute Jerusalem something-or-other--I wish I would have listened closer. Whatever it was, it had the consistency of a ground-up bike tire, but it tasted so good. I think it was supposed to have that consistency. Fish was good too, nicely seared and flaky.  Also, I think I saw LeBron's cousin there. That dude was like 6'38\" and had on a headband like he just got off the court.  I don't really have anything negative to say about it. I wish I did because I LOVE shitting on places, but these people got it down.  I would have given them 4-stars because they didn't really go ABOVE AND BEYOND, but they were patient with a bunch of tired old assholes, so c'est la vie. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very nice place and good food.  A white table cloth kind of place.  Oysters were great."}
{"text":"a fine tuned machine best seafood in cleveland keeps humming along  I keep waiting for the mediocrity I would expect from a big restaurant/local chain, but...  I have to say, Blue Point Grille delivers.  Consistently good food, very solid service and the place has a very well maintained appearance.  Once again, I went there last night and was beyond pleasantly surprised.  Honestly, I was wowed.  So many places you go to with expectations, and they just fall a bit short.  Not here.  Appetizers of house smoked mussels were outstanding.  The shrimp cocktail could have used a 5th shrimp on it, but they were fresh, large and firm. Fresh horseradish in the cocktail sauce was a nice touch too.  Entrees for us included one more appetizer of the ubiquitous tuna tartare. Fresh, not neon in color, and served with guacamole-like topping, it was flawless.  The salmon entree was off the charts great, and the special sea bass was also excellent.   Special props to the hosts/hostesses for taking such fine care of a 3 top walk-in during primetime on a busy Friday night.  And let's not forget that they have one of the finest happy hours in the warehouse district.  On Sundays as well.  Bravo Blue Point!  Carry on..."}
{"text":"Went there for our anniversary.   The service and ambiance  was outstanding.  My wife got the Maine Salmon and she enjoyed it.  I got the dry aged bone-in ribeye special.  It was a little pricey at 68 bucks and had more fat in it than I would have expected.  The taste was very good though.  The mushroom appetizer and the cream brule were top notch."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my husband and two friends.  Entrees were Faroh Island salmon, scallops, scallops and shrimp, and lobster.  All were very much enjoyed! The seafood was very fresh, perfectly prepared, and accompanied by tender crisp veggies and nicely mashed potatoes.  Yum!   We were seated a few minutes before our reservation time.  The servers were friendly, attentive, but not invasive.  Altogether a very pleasant evening.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We started dinner with Martinis which were excellent. The lamb meatball appetizer was a bit disappointing, but the tomato basil soup and lobster bisque soup were outstanding. I had the grouper with the lobster mashed potatoes which was great.  My wife had the salmon and loved the butternut squash risotto.  Service was excellent.   Would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the roasted chicken with lobster ravioli (amazing!!) and asparagus. The dessert was awesome! They brought a dessert sampler which was great! The panna cotta, cheese cake, key lime pie, flourless chocolate cake, and many more were so good!   I could tell service was great however our server was having an off night."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour. The oysters seemed like they had been shucked quite a while ahead. Texture wise they were quite dry.  The mussels were overcooked and the lobster risotto, while cooked perfectly, was a victim of heavy handed seasoning.  The service was slightly below average. Drinks weren't anything worth telling my friends about.  I don't think I'd recommend this place to anyone at this point."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and a had a great time! All our guests enjoyed their drinks (a mix of specialty cocktails and wine) and food. We did not order the seafood tiered tray, but saw it going around the restaurant, and it looked amazing.. coming from someone who despises seafood. I ordered a steak that came with cut potatoes and Brussels sprouts with bacon in them. It was delicious! It was also a rather large portion, so I had leftovers to take home. It is a bit pricy, but good for special occasions. Note their dress code too, make sure you are not wearing denim and dressed appropriately."}
{"text":"Mark was our waiter. We had a group of 9. He did very well explaining the specials and menus. Great service. The food was excellent. The lobster bisque was amazing. For dinner I got the Grouper. Perfectly cooked. Cocktails were delicious and strong. Can't wait I come back and try something else. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and wine, and I was thrilled this was on the company nickel (because it was a bit pricey).    Excellent seafood, great wine, attentive service.  The crowd was \"metro\" / business, and the atmosphere was just right for what we needed."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant downtown. Great for lunch, happy hour (best food specials in downtown), or dinner. Classy, upscale environment minus the large bill pushing and uncomfortable pretentiousness. If you haven't been, you need to go STAT!"}
{"text":"We came here 2x last week with a few buddies for dinner first time was good because I only ordered cook stuff. But the second time I ordered 8 raw oysters and steak for dinner. After 5th oysters, I got a really bad one. It was just disgusting! Like tasting garbage in your mouth. I almost threw up. I spat it out, went to the bathroom to wash my mouth and came back to report it to them. Eventually the manager came and he said he would take it off for me and made a bad joked about how they couldn't taste it before they serve it.  Apparently since they serve 80,000 oyster a year, it is bound to happen.  So basically, they took the oyster back, never brought me back another linen napkin. They said they would take the oysters off my bill. (Technically half the oysters off my bill since I didn't even eat the other half) Based on their actions, I felt like I paid way too much money for this garbage service. I didn't even want my streak anymore but they wouldn't let me cancel it. For a high end restaurant, I expected much better service. If I was them I wouldve comp the whole dinner? for one person since it \"rarely happens\" However that wasn't the end. I ended up with food poisoning later and had a really rough couple of days."}
{"text":"I just went to Blue Point for my Birthday dinner with some friends and everything was perfect!  The staff was so accommodating and everyone was very nice.  The drinks were excellent and I loved the Rombauer Sauv Blanc! My husband ordered the Blue Point oysters and he said they were the best he's had in a long time.  Every person loved their food; the Salmon was melt in your mouth and the Grouper was also excellent.  I can't wait until my next experience at Blue Point. Perfect place for a date night or celebration.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this restaurant.  I was only in Cleveland for two nights and was wishing for more time to return here.  Great look, service and incredible food.  I had the Grouper and it couldn't have been better.  Do not miss this place!!"}
{"text":"I am from out of town now ( I used to live here) When I think about fish in Cleveland my first reaction is \"Who caught the Crappie we are eating\".  so I am always excited when I find a good fish restaurant.  Had dinner a few years ago and had a good experience.  Came back last week.  Took a client to lunch and was not disappointed.  The service was great.  We had the Nagshead grouper and shrimp scallops.  Both were very tasty and I am always looking for restaurants to mix up some kind of special mashed potatoes.  The Lobster mash was excellent."}
{"text":"Can we just talk about happy hour for a minute?  Not only does Blue Point have weekday happy specials, but they offer their amazing happy hour menu Sunday from 4:00 to close!!!  Great service, amazing food and drink, and a really fantastic atmosphere.  The bar area, is super cozy too- hello great winter warm-up spot!!!  This place doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service by Sam, very attentive, attention to details, and will definitely comeback when in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"We came here from out-of-town to celebrate my daughter's graduation. We chose the Blue Point because it looked reasonably elegant and could accommodate a group of 12. We ordered appetizers, entrees, wine, dessert and coffee so had a chance to sample a lot of the menu. Appetizers were the most successful. Nice variety of choices and the oysters and calamari were fresh. Entrees were not impressive, with the exception of the pike, which was local, tasty and nicely presented. Other fish (snapper, grouper, salmon) seemed slightly over cooked and were accompanied by either overly complicated or lackluster flavor combinations. The fish didn't shine. Wine list was extensive, but none of the ones recommended were memorable. Desserts were the typical choices and tasted fine. Service was terrific and seamless. I couldn't help noticing that the clientele was mostly an over-60 crowd, so maybe that explains the less-than-exhilarating food and decor. We had a nice time, but if I lived in Cleveland, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing music, amazing waiter Nick, amazing drinks, amazing food and all with an amazing date! Make sure to get here quick very popular on holidays!! We sat upstairs and had an amazing view! I absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous. Staff and food way above par. Excellent happy hour with large variety of cheap eats like a grilled salmon Caesar salad entree for only $12. My favorite meal that keeps me coming back is the grouper served over lobster mashed potatoes and a vermouth cream. Extensive wine list also"}
{"text":"This is my mother's absolute favorite place to eat so I've been a few times, and while she is a lover of European seafood and fanciness and doting, nigh-overbearing wait staff, I am a bit put off by all three. It's definitely a bit stuffy in there, and I think it might be the only restaurant I've been in that has a sign out front about \"proper attire.\" The decor is very clean, very fancy, and pretty old-fashioned. I would complain about the silliness of being stuck in the 18th century, but hey, it's basically the only traditional fancypants restaurant in Cleveland proper, so it's a nice change of pace.  Let's get down to brass tacks. The food is pretty darn good. They know how to cook a steak, they know how to sear some tuna, and they know how to cook veggies and season food. It's hard to order anything and be disappointed. Their lobster mashed potatoes are absolutely to die for, and as an Irishman with a crippling addiction to mashers, I can say that with confidence. Everything is prepared with a light touch, nothing overdressed. If there's one place in Cleveland to go for precise, expert cooking and consistency, Blue Point is probably that place.  The flip side to this consistency is that they don't bring a lot of fresh ideas to the menu. Blue Point is the kind of place to go for solid, mostly traditional fare. Nothing will blow your socks off with its novelty, I can promise you that.  The price certainly matches the food-- no surprises here, obviously, but it's definitely on the higher end. For most of us, it's a special-occasion kind of place to eat. It's not to the point of being silly, like certain super-fancy restaurants that charge a ton just because they can (Morton's comes to mind... eurgh).  Go there on a weekend night for the added bonus of people-watching the crazy drunks stumbling around West 6th out the floor-to-ceiling windows!  Bottom line: damn good food, high prices but not sky-high, awesome service, and the fanciest pants that downtown Cleveland has to put on. Definitely recommended if you're looking for a nice night out in the 216!"}
{"text":"Blue Point Grille just redeemed Cleveland for me. I was sad and worried at first but if this restaurant is here, hope is alive. It's labeled as \"dressy\" here but I called ahead and was told they are \"casual.\" The sign on the door says \"proper attire required\" and my jeans were proper enough. Everything from the bread to the wine to the salad to the scallops was delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood restaurant downtown. I first went a few years ago for downtown Restaurant Week. I went last week for lunch. I got shrimp simply prepared with rice and broccoli. The portion size was great for lunch and I felt really good about the decision since it was healthy. The ambiance was great and it is a good place to meet colleagues for lunch."}
{"text":"If you're into it, try the oyster bar- they have a great selection!  The prices are actually surprising very reasonable for a fine dining experience.  My husband had the Grouper and I had the Blue Point Heaven- very good!  Will be returning for the oyster bar again!"}
{"text":"This is one of few fancy and upscale dining restaurant's which I came across in downtown (warehouse district).The place is very well laid out with formal and booth dining on one side & casual/bar seating on the other side.  Upon entering the establishment I was quickly greeted and walked over to lunch seating. They menu is not that exhaustive but had quite a lot of interesting seafood items. I went with \"Fast\" lunch menu which comes with a soup & salad with entree.($17)  Choose tomato soup with blackened salmon fish(blackened was done on my request). The soup though a small portion was delicious. Salmon was good but the portion was very small. Salad was well seasoned, service was good and on par."}
{"text":"I tried out Blue Point Grille during Cleveland Restaurant Week. The space is large and nicely appointed, with airy, high ceilings and a lot of character. The staff was very friendly.   On to the food: I had the seafood chowder, scallops, and the flourless chocolate torte. The seafood chowder had great, generous chunks of seafood, the scallops were delicious, and by the time I got to the torte I was already stuffed. Oh, probably because the bread was tasty and addictive. The torte was also very good. All around good food, though even better at restaurant week prices. I'm not sure I'd go for normal dinner entree prices. It looks like the menu has some options, though, with starters, soups, and salads that are very reasonable. A good place for a nice seafood dinner!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland and thought I'd try the Blue Point Grille.  The atmosphere was nice.  Upscale with a touch of exposed brick. I had the Lobster Bisque, Filet Oscar, and the Key Lime Tart. Everything was fantastic!  The staff and the service are amazing!  I'll be back when when I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We planned our New Year's dinner about a week in advance at Blue Point.  We treated my in-laws to dinner and the food was excellent.  We started off with some drinks, which were light and refreshing. I had a Bellini drink that was delicious and fruity with guava. The ladies had champagne and my FIL had red wine.   We ordered duck dumplings and oysters as appetizers, but I hate oysters, so I didn't even eat one. The dumplings were served over an arugula salad and were delicious.   The wife and I both ordered a bowl of lobster bisque, which was just dreamy. The chunks of lobster in it were heavenly.  Our waiter was very friendly and he was in a good mood because he was smiling and half laughing as he described the daily specials. He kept our cups full and brought us drinks quickly. This was a big improvement since my last visit.  For dinner, I ordered salmon and my wife ordered lobster.  A while later, our food was served and it looked amazing. It tasted even better. Blue Point really knows how to cook seafood. I haven't had better fish anywhere. I loved every bite of my meal, including the sides.  The bill was around $250, which was actually less than I expected for four of us. The taste and service were excellent.  We had a really good night at Blue Point and I am looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"Food was very good, met our expectations and the service was excellent. The server checked to see if we had plans after dinner which we did and she kept the pace appropriately fast without being pushy."}
{"text":"I love Blue Point. How could you not? It's classy, beautiful, and a special place for a nice occasion.   Or, you could do what we did, and just go for drinks and dessert. We sat at the bar, where the bartender was so kind and friendly. We ordered the chocolate sampler, with white chocolate ice cream, flourless cake, chocolate mousse and a peanut butter bar, and a couple glasses of wine. It was the perfect end to a long week. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the things I could write about this restaurant. I ate here a while ago while on a date. Everything I ate was true and utter perfection. Our waiter, Nick (I believe?) was a dream. He anticipated all of our needs and was incredibly kind and patient with us when we didn't know what to order. He checked in periodically and is absolutely a great asset to Blue Point Grille. I had the \"Surf and Turf\" featuring a steak and lobster tail. They served with real, warm butter and didn't mind that I wanted double vegetable instead of the veg-carb side that they typically do. Wine was fresh and crisp. I believe I had a Riesling. All in all, the dining experience was lovely even when the date was rather lackluster.  Definitely will go back again... sans date. :P"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour. Great prices! Seating is at the bar only. Was not too busy when we went; plenty of room, and no wait time.   Loved the mimosa drink thingy that I ordered from the happy hour menu. Bf also enjoyed his Three Philosopher beer. Ordered 1 oyster (can't comment too much on as I guess I am not an oyster person like I thought I would be, lol) - just tasted like oyster. Ordered mussels, which were very very good. Wish they gave me a spoon for the sauce - I loved the sauce, and was using mussel shells to try to scoop up as much as I could. Loved the bread slices that came with the mussels. Would come back just for that. Bf ordered a burger - good, nothing special to note. I got the lobster and crab roll, which I guess I had higher expectations for. Wish it had more flavor... but maybe that's what they're supposed to taste like?   Bottom line: good price for happy hour; get the mussels!"}
{"text":"Blue Point Grille has excellent seafood; certainly the best I've had in Cleveland and comparable with anything you'll find on the East Coast.  I had the Calamari, the My Blue (Point) Heaven (Shrimp, Scallops, small Lobster Tail), and a Chocolate Lava Cake.  The seafood was fresh, expertly prepared, and so, so tasty.  They also have a wonderful wine selection, and we partook in a Groth Cabernet.  All in all it was a great meal, made even better by the fact that I went to the Cavs game afterwards and they won in a nail-biter."}
{"text":"As others have stated, the proper attire required sign out front is a little much especially since their blue point oysters were apparently either miss handled or not kept at the proper temperature. I had a field of greens salad and half dozen blue points and was incredibly ill just short of the point of going to the hospital. I could overlook their snootiness if they would try harder to not serve food that could kill the patrons."}
{"text":"The food here was good, not amazing, just your standard steakhouse fare. We had the calamari to start which was really good. Then for mains we got the salmon plate and filet mignon.  The restaurant had an up-scale vibe to it and an okay ambience overall.  Overall, nothing to write home about, just a nice local steakhouse with good food. If you're looking for a spectacular night out, this would not be the place to go."}
{"text":"Blue Point really does not do anything for me.  I feel like maybe I experienced it on an off night. Maybe we got unlucky with wait staff? I'm really undecided about whether I'd go there again. That's not something I experience often in my dining outings - and I don't like it.  From start to finish our dining experience left us wanting more.  We were left waiting an excessive time (on a very slow night) to place drink orders.  The same happened again for our food.  The food was good.  Above average - but did not stand out in any way (and it should for that price tag!)"}
{"text":"Blue Point and Fish Shack (owned by Kate's Fish at the West Side Market) are my favorite places to eat seafood in Cleveland. Fish Shack is definitely a better value. Blue Point should be reserved for special occasions or for their lunch or happy hour offerings. I took my old man here for a Christmas dinner a couple weeks back and it was one of the best meals in recent memory. He ordered the flounder special and I went with the grouper. Both were prepared excellently and the sides were delicious. We decided to go for the gusto and had dessert. I had a s'mores type dessert and he had some kind of caramel thing. Both were great ways to finish off the perfect holiday meal between a father and son."}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week, and was thrilled to see that the items on their prix fixe menu were on the regular menu too. Major plus there.  The seafood chowder was fantastic, with large chunks of fish, and other seafood. Much better than many other chowders I've had, even in New England. I think that was my favorite.  I definitely would recommend going there. (Restaurant week/with specials or not.)   As for the wait staff, fantastic service. Our glasses were refilled like magic, food came just at the right time, and our waitress was very helpful with drink suggestions."}
{"text":"Would have given it a 5 but the manager was just being annoying walking back and forth looking at my plate and everyone else's. If there was a problem with my food or anyone else I'm sure we would've said something. Uncomfortable being watched while eating. Anyways the food was great but service was annoying! Don't know if I would go back!"}
{"text":"If your a seafood lover than this is the place for you! I'm not, so obviously I wasn't as big of a fan of the food choices. My parents love seafood though and they thought this place was awesome! It's in the heart of the Warehouse district and has a very very good reputation in Cleveland! The inside is decorated so nicely and it is very inviting. The walls are a deep blue and the ceilings have huge chandeliers! I highly recommend coming here for a nice meal."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of happy hour at BP. There are $1 oysters, a really good burger and many other reasonably priced options. BP does happy hour all day Sunday, but at the actual bar only. There were no bar seats available at 6:30p on Sunday though so I sat in the dining room for the first time.   The server we had was exactly what I would want and perfectly covered being both nice and attentive.   A good appetizer was the oyster sampler. While priced at more than $1 each, there were four different oyster types that came with the dish which the server identified as she served the dish. While simple, and only served with butter, the bread offered was good too. It was warm first of all, with a crusty top and soft center.   It happened to be restaurant week so I was able to take part in that. I enjoyed the salmon entr√©e which was served with fluffy Charleston gold rice mixed with baby shrimp. My favorite, broccolini, was also present. The Commodore is a great value entr√©e combo. It comes with a 10 ounce filet mignon and a jumbo lobster tail, mashed potatoes, asparagus. The lobster was a bit undercooked in places.   For desserts, Mitchell's ice cream was available, including a flavor our server said was initially made exclusively for BP. The other desserts we were told were all made in house. The raspberry sorbet was as good as it gets. Creamy and rich in flavor and a big serving. The key lime tart had a graham cracker crust and was paired with a blueberry jam that went really together.   I'll still probably frequent happy hour more than the actual dining room, but it was nice to try it out as well."}
{"text":"I thought you couldn't get great seafood in Cleveland. I mean good raw oysters and lobster. You're going to have to pay for it but it's really good. I was spoiled when I went to New England a couple of years ago and then to Portland OR last year, so this was a really nice surprise. I'll have to come back for the oyster happy hour deal."}
{"text":"Always a fantastic experience , especially of you are craving raw bar or a seafood tower. Oysters are great and the mignonette is so good! Also, the nag's head grouper is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Happy hour offered in bar only. You may need to ask bartender as they do not have signs or advertisements but do have a small happy hour menu with excellent options, including walleye sandwich w homemade ketchup, lobster rolls, $5 drinks. Generous portions. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Excellent seafood restaurant. The service was friendly and knowledgeable and the scallops were amazing."}
{"text":"Great restaurant if you are with steak or seafood lovers. I had the filet and scallops, and both were delish! Great wine menu. My husband had the surf and turf and he said it was fantastic. Dessert menu is amazing. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week and had a great night.  Our server was fantastic at making recommendations (both on and off the restaurant week menu) based on our tastes, and also made great wine pairing recommendations based on my personal palate.  The food was great.  It's so easy to ruin scallops, but when you get it right, it can be sublime.  And that was my experience with my entree.  Can't remember what my bf had, but it came with a lobster mashed potato that is evidently super popular.  Not sure why I wasn't really blown away... I liked the parsnip puree on my plate better.  But my meal was fantastic!  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"While visiting the Cleveland Clinic, we found Blue Point on a web-search. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of service, ease of valet parking, and quick seating. I had the blackened swordfish and a wedge salad. Everything for our table came out perfectly cooked and tasted great."}
{"text":"Loved dinner here. Easily made a reservation online and were impressed with the dining room decor and gracious service. Bar area looked hip and an enormous list of oysters is prominently displayed. Watched towers of seafood go by and longed for the days when I had an expense account (LOL)! The nags head grouper with lobster mashed potatoes was fabulous and their wedge is one of the best ever. My husband loved the cracked crab appetizer and lobster bolognese. Good wine list. Valet available. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow- what a phenomenal restaurant!  I had a truly remarkable dinner with my family at Blue Point Grille this week.  Each course was better than the other.  The chef is extremely gifted!  Our server, Nick, also added to our experience with his great service!  The restaurant is decorated beautifully as well.  We started with three appetizers: the Duck Confit Dumplings, the Ahi Tuna Tartare with sweet potato chips and the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail.  All three were amazing, but the dumplings were my favorite.  They were very unique!  The crispy dumplings tasted so good dipped in the pineapple chutney.  For my entree, I went with NIck's recommendation: the Nag's Head Grouper.  Nick related that the Grouper dish has been on Blue Point's menu since it opened.  It was easy to see why!  The Grouper came with a side of lobster mashed potatoes and garlic braised spinach.  The fish was in a vermouth cream sauce- delicious!  The entire dish was flawless.  The ingredients were fresh and high quality.  The lobster mashed potatoes tasted more like fresh lobster than your typical recipe.  I was beyond impressed!  I also tried a bite of my mom and dad's entrees.  My dad got the Lobster Risotto- which was only $10.00!  It was great!  My mom ordered the Pecan Crusted Walleye in a bourbon glaze.  It was to divine!  For dessert, we split the Chocolate Quartet and the Key Lime Pie.  I would definitely recommend both!  I will absolutely make a stop at Blue Point the next time I am in Cleveland.  Everything we tried was wonderful- I am eager to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"Everything looked perfect on the plate---crab cake, slaw, roasted potato chunks on honey mustard sauce.  I took my first bite of the crab.  Too strange.  Something's wrong.  A second bite, then I took a closer look at the cake, breaking it apart with my fork.  Yes.  It looked like HAIR.  And yes---IT FELT JUST LIKE HAIR in my mouth.   Not a single piece, dice or chunk---just a matted mass of fine threads.  Probably made from the least desirable, lowest grade on the market---intended for restaurant use, but solely for flavoring broths, then discarded---not meant to be eaten.  But Blue Point shapes it into individual servings, then offers it on their menu as JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE.     My first one, but maybe my last---from ANY restaurant---because of the lingering yech factor.  It was also my first visit here---and unquestionably my last.  Because I expected the results of at least MOST dishes tried, to be a notch or two above average---not below---for restaurants of this acclaimed caliber, I can't imagine wanting to try anything else from their menu.  There might be some great exceptions here, but after their HAIRBALL CAKE---and other misses---we'll never know, since we won't be returning.  *** In all interactions with server C-----, I was       my normally polite, friendly, non-intimida-       ting self.   BREAD   2 stars Unremarkable flavor, with a thick golden-brown crust, which had already softened.  (Maybe a day or two old, plastic wrap just removed.).  I was starving, and would have stuffed myself if at least 4 stars.   Most untouched.   NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER   3.5 stars Surprisingly thin consistency---like soup.  Sprinkling of tiny carrot and potato cubes.  Teeny green bits---probably celery, parsley, other herbs.  Pretty---like confetti.  Their take on a refined style?  Maybe.  Or a cost-cutting move to stretch BP dollars.  Very nicely-flavored, but more of milk, some cream, and seasonings. No discernible clam pieces and very weak clam flavor---like a light peppery vegetable cream soup.     RAW OYSTERS   5 stars Expected.  No prep, except shucking.    NAG'S HEAD GROUPER   4.5 stars Pan-seared Black---their House Specialty.  Well-prepared.  Meager amounts of tasty braised spinach and flavorful Vermouth cream sauce.  LOBSTER MASHED POTATOES   2 stars Had potential---if it had butter and cream additions instead of just BROTH !?   The potato's naturally dry mealiness begs for fats to flavor it and smooth it out.  If there was any, maybe a whopping quarter gram.  Very small lumps throughout.  Could have been lobster.  Maybe potato.  Maybe both.  Good lobster flavor, but unpleasant grainy texture.  JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE    minus 10 stars Nearly flavorless, too.  But not the slaw!  Nasty...intense...inedible.  I never described it that way to C----, but asked what that distinct flavor might be.  He was agreeable, trying to help, but none of the ingredients (I'm familiar with all he mentioned) could account for the peculiar taste.        \"I've tried a number of dishes, but I've never had a crab cake---this is my first time....is this stringy consistency typical?...do other restaurants serve it like this, too?\"  Uncomfortable, he nodded slightly, and took a deep breath.  He was also likely thinking, \"Oh, boy, here it comes.\"  (I'm SURE I wasn't the only one who ever asked about that crab.)  I continued, just above a whisper,    \"From all I've read and pictures I've seen, crab cakes have pieces in it.\"   \"Yes...uh...but we like to concentrate on presentation.\"  Honest...almost verbatim.  Okaaay...  NOW, everything was coming into focus.  If there's little flavor and feels like you're rolling a wad of dog groomer clippings around in your mouth, it's good enough to serve.  Got it.  Taste...texture...irrelevant.  What really matters is how everything LOOKS when served.    \"I'm sorry, but I don't understand....the menu said JUMBO LUMP crab meat.  That's what THIS is?\"    Becoming flustered, maybe irritated, \"Well... if we did THAT...it would fall apart (holding his hands in the shape of a ring)...you know?\"  2-3 seconds of silence.  I was speechless.  What sounded absurd was, in fact, the way they choose to prepare food here.  My suspicions were confirmed.  Appetizing appearance with unskilled, unappetizing results.  \"Can I get you something else?\"     I smiled, \"No thank you.\"  I was finished playing BLUE POINTLESS---this dizzying menu word game.  By then I'd lost my appetite, and was getting a grasp on all I'd heard.  Maybe it was because I'm naturally pleasant and non-confrontational,  is precisely why he never offered to take the crab off the check.  Now---too late---I regret never insisting he do just that.        CREME BRULEE    minus 2 stars Sampled husband's.  Not even close.  I've made authentic.  Very pale yellow creme brulee has a distinctly unique, light silky texture.  Theirs is more banana-yellow heavy pudding consistency, close to egg custard."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Party of four. Reservations for 7:30 pm on a Saturday.   Order bottled beer. Taps on the draft must not get used much and they served two different drafts flat and an inch under the rim like they came from old lines. Not sure how the bartender failed to notice after the pour.   Ran out of the special sea bass, notified me over half hour after I ordered. I understand this happens but we were far from last seating.   The two appetizers we ordered never served. I asked about them 45 minutes after ordering and server said sorry she could rush them in but we didn't want them right on top of our entrees so we passed.   Manager stopped by and asked how things were. I told him about the special running out and the appetizers being forgotten. He said our server had birdied him and he apologized and offered us dessert and after dinner drinks to make up for it which was nice.   My meal came. Same preparation as the bass special but with halibut. Fish was decent. East Asian preparation was disappointing: sauce had nice flavor but vegetables overcooked and soggy. The whitefish at my local Chinese restaurant is much better and less than half the cost.   Comped dessert was key lime. It was mediocre. Whiskey was good.   My wife liked her meal. The place looks cool with nice big windows but for well over $50 a person even with the comped dessert and drinks  the experience was disappointing.  One cool feature:  I'm almost certain this is the same restaurant space Tom Berlinger calls his ex-wife in movie Major League."}
{"text":"Having decided to incorporate more fish in my diet, we selected this place for dinner on Thursday evening.  Because we had just enjoyed the charcuterie platter at D'Vine on the same block, we were modest in our ordering.  I had a Caesar salad and the Walleye; my wife had the lobster mashed potatoes.  What can I say...LOBSTER!  Incredible.  My walleye was delicious...tender, not tough.  flaky and fragrant, not musky or overpowering.  All in all, a great evening and solid food!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful food experience at this upscale restaurant in Cleveland. Delicious menu-extensive oyster selection, variety of grilled items and also chef's signature preparations were tasty. Attentive staff, manager, P.J. was very accommodating as well as Melissa our server had full knowledge of the preparation of items on menu. Will definitely recommend this place to our friends on the East coast when they come to visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite happy hour place in Cleveland and to make it even happier it's happy hour all day on Sunday. By the name you can guess it's a seafood joint, and appeared like a classy joint for classy broads. Bartender and waiters were fun with goo suggestions. Seafood was balls out fresh, oysters were clean without sand. Also had a salmon Caesar salad and the salmon was perfect moist and tender!  Also had crab legs which resembled dungeness but was called something else (sorry brain fart right now). Prices were very reasonable. I used to like to do 65 cent oysters on Wednesdays at a place just across the street but this place has ruined it and now I can't go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Obviously one of the great dinning experiences in Cleveland, but I wanted to add that they have a great happy hour as most places in Cleveland do."}
