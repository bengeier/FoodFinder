{"text":"First of all the place before this was awful for food and service. Thank goodness they're gone. This place is nice and new. Family run and genuinely trying to do their best.  One night evven though they were about to close they still opened for us and fed us very well.  We have been many times and will definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and i eat here often it is a great place to have dinner  the food is amazing.
The portions are not huge (fine dinning) but my mouth Waters every time i think about eating there.
I love the shrimp with spinach and lemon sauce ! 
Not very cheap but worth it if you have a special occasion !"}
{"text":"This place took over Theresa's. It's family owned and very good. The menu is varied from pizzas and pastas to fish and meat. The service is attentive and friendly. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Food was so so. Service was terrible... 

They took away the dishes and wines twice without asking me when I didn't finish... can u believe that? When u are eating and talking with ur friend, some one took away ur plate in front of u... My friend wants to share his wine with me and they took it away too...

They give us the bill right after we said we don't want any dessert... we ordered 2 appetizers and 2 main course... when we finish, the waiter come s over and ask if we wanna dessert menu, we said no. Then he gives the bill in next minute without our request... Half of the tables are empty. There's no body waiting for seats... we are quiet and nice customers... 

Anyway, we still leave tips. But this is the first and last time been there."}
{"text":"Decent service but what I ate was really NOT fresh. We left $100 for the two of us. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Ristorante Don Vincenzo this past Saturday night (Mar.11) and was greatly impressed by the food and service.  Our waiter was funny and engaging and made our special night great.  The Steak was delicious and my wife's pasta was extremely tasty (Shrimp and Tagnatelli). Highly recommend this restaurant.  It's a small and quaint restaurant that is \"Perfecto\""}
{"text":"WORST restaurant we've ever been too. All of our steaks came raw and the service was awful. Very unorganized seeing as they don't use computers to keep track of the orders. The servers were extremely rude and didn't show any sympathy for us after a bunch of us had sent the steaks back for being raw. When the bills came it was a disaster and very stressful. I would never go back nor would I ever suggest eating at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food, superb service, immaculate facility. Atmosphere is really welcoming. I highly recommend it. I will be back time and time again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Our first time dining at this restaurant.  The pastas were good but the service was horrible.  Will not come back."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant that is always fresh and tasty! Owners are amazing and always going out of their way for their customers. My mother and I come here regularly and always enjoy our dinners! Very lovely restaurant right or dufferin!"}
{"text":"Great local Italian Restaurant. Great food with great prices 
Excellent selection with fresh ingredients. 
I enjoyed the antipasto, fennel salad to start. 
Mixed grill for my main and the Tiramisu to wrap it up. 

Match it with a bottle of wine we had an amazing night."}
{"text":"Two star as we ordered our food and waited almost an hour. I ordered seafood pasta. The calamari where tough and the clans where under cooked. I sent it back and they were nice enough not to charge me. Too bad as u had been at this location when under previous management and the food was excellent. Won't go back."}
{"text":"wow where do I start?  the waiter looked angry and ready to fight if you asked for anything.  Had bruschetta brought to the table and it looked good, but had a weird after taste.  Ordered the Carbonara and that was a mistake.  This place used to have such amazing carbonara.  The plate of pasta I got was soupy.  There were a few bits of (what looked like and was hoping) pancetta were were chewy at best.  The pasta was swimming in this out-of-the-box cheese sauce (which is wrong by the way.  The sauce is supposed to be brought together with a cracked egg and cheese, maybe with a touch of pasta water to loosen it up a bit).  There were no onions in it as the menu had identified it would and the pasta was overcooked.  It tasted like the KRAFT DINNER WHITE CHEDDAR version, except that KD would probably not have been so soupy.  The carbonara was wonderfully priced at $20.  The most I've ever pay for KD.  For a fine-dining restaurant, this place missed it huge!  Not to mention it took nearly an hour to get my entree.  Never again.  No thanks.  Good luck."}
{"text":"Teresa's is a small, family-owned Italian restaurant. We went here once for dinner and although the service was slow, the food was very good. We started with a caesar salad, followed by the Teresa's pasta and a sauce-less pizza. The pasta was a little heavy on the cream, but that's what makes it taste so good. Their pizzas are named after the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and I believe the sauce-less pizza was the Donatello. It was also delicious. The food even tastes great for leftovers the next day. The decor is fancy and there is very little noise, so this is a good place to bring a date."}
