{"text":"The food here is amazing, me and my man were trying out the different Caribbean food restaurants and this is most definitely hands down the best place out of all the places we ate at. We love getting either the lunch/dinner curry, fried or jerk chicken always amazing they never fail. The proportion is very generous at such a fair price! This place is amazing."}
{"text":"All around good food made by authentic people. Reason for the three stars, if you aren't their culture, they will up charge you based on your appearance. They should treat everyone the same so they keep coming back. Simple."}
{"text":"If your on the go and craving Caribbean food this location won't disappoint for either  breakfast or lunch. The peanut porridge is full of potent flavour, and the curry and fry chicken is scrumptious."}
{"text":"One of several mom and pop shop jerk in the area, but this place offers up chicken cooked from a drum.  Instead of roasted in an oven like most places, you get an authentic BBQ taste that's makes every ting all ire.    Chicken is most, and decently flavourful.  The place could use a bit of touch up and clean up, but food wise, definitely a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Very cold day today made me not want to go out to buy lunch so I resulted to Skip the Dishes.  I have not had very good experiences in the past with Skip the Dishes but The New Caribbean Queen stood out to me.  My order was prepared and delivered on time.  I ordered the jerk chicken dinner.  The portion was fair the chicken was cooked well with just the right amount jerk sauce.  Spicy but not over spicy.  Just the perfect amount.  The rice and peas were fresh and super tasty.  I will definitely be trying this place again."}
{"text":"The food tun up! Oh em gee the food tun UP! So ... I ordered through Skip the Dishes.  My order:  - mackerel with fry dumpling, came with a free porridge $5.99 (the breakfast special) - large ackee and salt fish $9.99 and; - medium peanut and carrot porridge $5  Because I ordered over a certain amount the delivery was free.   About the food: Price: I got 2 meals and 2 porridge for the same price I would get 1 meal and 1 porridge from Sunrise.  Portion: the amount of food I got for the price? Wooowwww, I'm impressed. It's so much food! Taste: the food tun UP UP UP (it tastes good!)!!!    I'm really pleased with what I got and have breakfast for tomorrow too."}
{"text":"I hear a lot of people talking about how good the food is at this restaurant, so I decided to try it for myself and I couldn't believe how horrible the food tasted. You get a large portion for a very, very, very cheap price and I think that is what makes people keep dinning at this restaurant because it is definately not the food or the customer service there. I wouldn't feed my dog a pudding or anything for that matter at this restaurant. I think people need to consider what they are putting into their bellies and stop hyping up a restaurant because it is cheap. Cheap is not always good, who sells large portions of food for $5.99, you would have to be Robin Hood, using your own wealth to supply demands from the poor communities at that price. You can't even by chicken at the supermarket for that price let alone sell it at a restaurant for $5.99. This makes me a skeptic, I must be honest, I don't think that the meat is actually what they say it is. This wouldn't be the first time that a restaurant got called out for selling pigeon meat while telling its customers that is chicken so I think that someone should have a health inspector confirm that the meat is authentically chicken. It is really a horrible place to dine if you value your health. I give it ZERO STARS but on this site it would have to be a 1 for my post to get posted."}
