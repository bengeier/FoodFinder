{"text":"Ramella's is fabulous. It's the ONLY pizza you should ever eat in Kent, as it absolutely blows away the competition. You're seriously wasting your money elsewhere. A lot of places with a big variety of toppings use low quality stuff to make up for it. Not Ramella's. Everything is fresh and delicious gourmet level food. Nowhere else in the area can you get stuff like kalamata olives, gouda, caramelized onions or roasted garlic on a pizza.  You order boneless wings from Ramella's, you don't get weird breaded poultry tumors like at the chains. You get CHAR-GRILLED SLICED CHICKEN BREAST. Unbelievable! Something to know about Ramella's, they use provolone as their base cheese instead of mozz (they don't even HAVE mozz) and they only offer one type of crust. But it's hand-tossed magic, and you wouldn't want anything else. Whatever you do, get their Garlic Jalapeno sauce on the side. It's probably the best thing they make and they ought to be bottling it."}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza! Great ingredients, crust is delicious. Agree that garlic jalape√±o dip is a must try!"}
{"text":"Don't answer the phone during business hours. The online ordering system doesn't work and it's impossible to get a hold of anyone."}
{"text":"I created my yelp account after using it for years just so I could write a review for this place. This place is amazing! If you're looking for a pizza that has different toppings than your typical pepperoni, sausage, green peppers this is the place to get! The buffalo pizza may be the best pizza I've ever had. It also pays to like their Facebook page because almost every day or so they post a new deal. Thank you Ramellas for making a broke college kid even more broke because I cant order pizza from anywhere else after having this."}
{"text":"First...and probably last. Was excited for something different, and didn't mind paying a little more $ for something good. Ordered a 12\" BBQ grilled chicken & bacon pizza.  But once I opened the box at home, found a 9.5\" (cut into 8 slices, like the 12\" was supposed to be) AND ZERO BBQ GRILLED CHICKEN. Paid $12.99 for a disappointment."}
{"text":"They're closed for good for over a year already which is most likely why no one answers the phone over there."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Aly on this and balance out my other review. It can be great at times or terrible. Good luck guessing!"}
{"text":"Unique place, something different from ordinary pizza. Best pizza I've ever had! Plus they deliver"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. When it's a hit it's easily the best pizza in kent but I've had some incorrect orders, or undercooked dough as well, even then though it's still pretty good. Wednesdays is BOGO pizza - easily the best day to but. They're special pizzas are usually very good as well."}
{"text":"Best delivery option in Kent hands down. Their mobile app is really convenient, too. It actually works better than Hungry Howie's."}
{"text":"Thank you, fellow yelpers! I tried this place because of you, and it was DELICIOUS. I was in the mood for something a little more sophisticated, and after seeing their long list of special toppings, including sun-dried tomato, and sauces, including Alfredo and pesto, I thought I'd yelp them. The reviews confirmed that this place was worth checking out, and it was worth it! I also ordered a side of cinnamon twists, which reminded me of elephant ears from the fair. Bonus! I highly recommend this cute little place!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and even the garlic cheese bread is fantastic.  They both have a unique taste to them and the marinara is superb.  A must try!"}
{"text":"For a few months now I've been trying to find a really good pizza place. I'm not talking about a good \"chain\" either, because I wanted a small mom and pop type place. The toppings. Phenomenal. The cheese. Flavorful and chewy and unique. The sauce was tasty and I just wish there was more of it. It was only a 15 minute wait for pickup and the service was quick and friendly. I may have found my place. I just wish it was closer to where I live. Next time you're in Kent you should try it."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, great variety of offerings! Best in Kent!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Kent. Really nice that they do free delivery. I'd give five stars if the service was better."}
{"text":"Very tasty! The price can be high, but it is good quality. Not at all like super greasy college town pizza. I like all the options for building your own pizza."}
{"text":"There's much better pizza out there.  This place uses good cheese but there's just not much else going on for it.  The zarolli I got was still raw dough in the middle, so beware if you order that.  yuck :("}
