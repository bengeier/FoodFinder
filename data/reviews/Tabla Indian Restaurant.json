{"text":"Recently tried this restaurant for lunch.  The Lamb Korma was spot on with just the right amount of spiciness!  YUM!  Repeat customer here!!"}
{"text":"I have been there and like the food. Tried Biryani and Paneer dish they were really good. My kids loved idli,vadas over there. Service also was very good welcome change under the new management. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Fresh and authentic.  Portion size for appetizers was larger than I expected.  Service was warm and casual, not fancy.    The team appears to be working very hard to bring authentic Indian cooking to our city.  I'd go back and try a few different dishes soon!  A much needed added to the Indian restaurant scene in Charlotte."}
{"text":"So good!  We just relocated from LA and are on the constant search for new and wonderful restaurants.  This place was amazing.  Better than several Indian restaurants we were accustomed to dining at in LA and very happy to have come across this gem."}
{"text":"New name but same great food.  Love coming to Tabla, it has never disappointed.  I moved to Charlotte from Southern California and this place is leaps and bounds above any Indian food I had in the west coast.  You can never go wrong with the Chicken Tikka Masala, or any of the biryani."}
{"text":"Great new Indian restaurant in charlotte y'all. I drive past this place all the time, it's easy to miss. I noticed it and one day stopped in. The service is phenomenal and the food was good. I'll have a more detailed review on my second visit."}
{"text":"I've eaten Indian Food for over 30 years and have always found it tasty and vibrant. But the main problem I've found is that most restaurants put out the same 20 or so greatest hits. Not Tabla. They bring a whole different perspective to the table. There food is tasty and savory. Not too spicy and very colorful. I got the Chicken Tiranga which is a mix of 3 different types. Butter Chicken , Chicken Tikka and Tandori Chicken. All served over a bed of onions, peppers and cabbage. This dish is very colorful and they represent the 3 colors of the Indian Flag. . I also ordered two staple items. Mango Lassi and Garlic Naan. The wait staff was excellent and attentive without hovering. I invited my brother to come up to visit and we will be back in two weeks."}
{"text":"Best goat biryani I've had that's not my moms. I don't think I can give this place higher praise. Will be back."}
{"text":"We have tried this restaurant couple of times and it has been great. The appetizer choices are very good The Family pack options for biryanis is an awesome deal."}
{"text":"Abundant vegetarian options on the lunch buffet, full of flavor, and delightfully spicy."}
{"text":"Being close to home we have tried this place a couple of times and have been quiet happy about it. The appetizers and biryanis have been good. Really like the variety of options they have in the biryani apart from the standard fun biryani. The service has been pretty good as well! Hope they will continue to maintain the quality."}
{"text":"This place is  good. Like, really good. We had the goat biryani that was delicious. In fact, I think biryani is what they are known for... So you probably can't go wrong with any of them.  The samosa Chaat was yummy as well.  Beyond the delicious food, the service was amazing. The servers are very kind, informative and attentive.  I will definitely be back.  PS. They also do lunch buffets"}
