{"text":"Been here for a couple of events.  Don`t care much for the atmosphere, I agree with those who say it`s very pretentious.  People seem to stick in their own groups with minimal mingling.  I hate how they have the TV`s on the walls so everyone can watch you dancing.  The food is nothing special and the service is so-so."}
{"text":"WOW - for the way it's written up you definitely don't have that experience.  The staff is mediocre and the experience overall was lack luster.  I started with the Tokyo Tataki - It was overflowing with soy sauce (so very salty) and over cooked for a seared Tuna.    I ordered the Cheddar Bacon Burger.... it was like a hocky puck.  It was dry and lacking flavour.  I sent it back ad they look it off the bill.    One of my guests had the mac and cheese - that was definitely a disappointment for all.  Reading the description then looking at the plate.... two completely different things.  Drink were \"okay\" though my ginger ale leaned towards flat.  All in all, given the location - go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been to West twice. The first time, it wasn't that bad. Probably mediocre at best. The second time was awful and confusing.   My first experience there was with a few friends for dinner and drinks. The service was extremely slow and we didn't see the waitress until 20 mins after we sat down. After our food was given to us, we never saw the waitress again until she gave us our bill. She looked like she didn't want to be there. I ordered the chicken caesar salad. It was okay, to be honest, I think Moxies or Boston Pizza have a better one. I can't remember what my friends had but I know two of them tracked another waiter down to send their meals back because they were cold. The layout is pretty cool in West and their drinks are pretty good, other than that, it was too loud, the service sucked and the food was mediocre.   The second time I was there for a friends birthday. I arrived a couple hours later than she did, and I was excited to party the night away. When I got to the front of the line, I was shocked that the bouncer denied me. I asked why he wouldn't let me in. No answer and no I wasn't drunk, underage or using a fake ID. I was very annoyed, but kept my cool. My friends that were inside already vowed to never go back. I tried contacting West on their Twitter account but they never got back to me which was very annoying.   I won't be back at West anytime soon and I will never encourage people to go there."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch, dinner, various tweet-ups and the like, and the service here has been excellent each and every time I've visited.  The food is so reasonably priced; many dishes can be had for between $8-15 and it all tastes great!  My favourites are the Lamb Burger (alas, only available for one day per week as a daily special, and only for lunch) and the Passionfruit Tart is something to *kill* over (but alas, it too is limited, this time as a summer seasonal special, but the apple pie that has replaced it is great too).  In fact, the desserts served here are so good and so cheap, that I once visited solely for dessert; no main course or even drinks.  There are worse ways to spend $6 or $8, in my opinion, and did I mention I'd be willing to kill for some of that delicious Passionfruit Tart?  One of their big draws is the rooftop patio, and while it wasn't able to open this year, I'm anxiously waiting to try it out as soon as it is open, probably next year when the weather warms up.  The decor and atmosphere is very sophisticated, but the dress code is casual, which is something I appreciate a lot.  One time me and my friends were looking for a place to eat on a Saturday evening after a day of taking photographs downtown, and we were all raving about WEST.  There were some in our group who had never been, so we decided to go there, but one of our friends was dressed in simple t-shirt and jeans; we were afraid he'd get kicked out based on how the staff and other patrons were usually dressed the other times we've visited in the late evenings.  But they had absolutely no problem with how we were dressed and it was business as usual, which I think was awesome.  Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"Are you looking for a place to seem pretenious? Then you've found your latest stomping grounds! The people who go to West generally are going to be 'seen', not to enjoy their company.  West has two seperate menus for lunch and dinner, but unfortunately, the best food is served at lunch only. The menu that you get to peruse regardless of what time it is, has both the lunch and dinner options. So don't get your heart set on anything, as you might find out its for lunch only!  The only saving grace for this restaurant/bar is the cocktails. I highly recommend the watermelon lemonade bevy. Or if you need a little snack, the caesar is perfect as it is served with a jumbo shrimp!"}
{"text":"Very poor quality of food with big price tags. Definitively place not worth to go to. And extremely slow service...we had to wait for each drink or water 10 or 15 minutes. What a waste of time and money. I can't believe that they are till on the market, once you've been there once you won't go anymore. Sooooo many better places in Calgary so don't let decor to fool you."}
{"text":"West makes me want to vomit.  Literally this place is horrible. The service and managment is disgusting. Not professional at all. The bouncers think there hot shit! I had a guest list 2 times and never my name was on the list., first time i made resv. they said it was fully booked at 6, 7,8,9,10:00 for restaurant. I get there at 6:45 is empty lots of empty tables and they charged me at the door $15. I was not impressed at all. They always mess up with my groups orders..I dont recommend this place to anyone, its expensive for nothing. theres alot of hotter places like 1410 rooftop patio, 80th and ivy, and classic jacks who will treat u with alot more respect. Pretty safe to say I won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great times, meh food.  West is a like a person with multiple personalities. If you happen to get the right combination, it can be amazing and interesting. If you happen to arrive at the wrong time, it can be something else.   West has a great patio, when it is warm and sunny, it is the closest you can get to bliss this side of a white sand beach.   First, the positives: 1) Lunch/after work with a good friends on a warm day - Join the legions of office workers who have found a way to soak up the elusive Calgary sunlight & warmth while downtown  2) Late on a Friday/Saturday night when the beautiful people are out and \"peacocking\" around - some of the drinks are nice (watermelon lemonade) and the mix of booths and open air dance floor can make for a great night  Now the unhappy combinations: 1) If you are looking for a good meal - Sadly West's cuisine does not match its amazing scenery. Having had multiple meals here, I cant get over the fact that the food is trying way too hard to be cool without the flavor to back it up. I get the sneaking suspicion that they have an Earl's style production line in the kitchen and a similar level of culinary skill. Sadly, the food is more complicated and creative making for a rough combination.     2) When the crowds are dead or full of posers - The crowds are very hit or miss, some days make you think you have entered an episode of Jersey Shore, other days you can meet a great group of friendly and fun people.   All in all, the split personalities will continue to divide opinions about West. Having said that, it seems almost part of the mystique because you never know which personality you will meet.  5/30"}
{"text":"Do not waste your $500 on reserving an area. Its a huge rip off. It does not include anything and staff is completely unprofessional and disorganized. We booked the private area on the roof top patio. And our guest list was not honored. Guest had issues or rejected at the door. Security would not help keep randoms  from crashing our party and the bartenders were shady and scamming extra tips off our orders. We had to bring our own cake and decorations. Brutal brutal brutal!! This place has taken a nose dive into a trailer park compared to the classy establishment it once was."}
{"text":"During the summer, West only seats on their rooftop patio (weather permitting of course). So considering how hard getting a patio seat at any other restaurant, I think this is a huge bonus.  I went to the 3rd floor on Scotia to get into West, and the hostess simply pointed to the stairs in the middle of the restaurant and said \"Patio\". K. Thanks . . .  When I made it to what I assumed was the patio, I kind of felt uneasy. It seemed abandoned up there with unfinished construction; they could at least have someone there to reassure you that you're going in the right direction (and not get attacked!)  I could see my group as I made it to the seating area so I headed over. Our waitress was quick to take our order (3 of us including me got the lobster mac and cheese, one the linguine and another the West Burger). Since we had a later lunch, it was less busy and so our food came pretty much right away and we all dug in. All of us who got pasta loved our food, our friend who got the burger came to realize his burger was still pink after a few bites - YUCK! Our waitress resolved this promptly with a new order and the manager even came by to apologize and said the burger meal would be taken off our bill - NICE!  Besides the burger incident, the food experience was great and so was our service. I'd be up for some lobster mac and cheese again."}
{"text":"I ventured here one Friday for an early lunch with a friend. She told me you'd normally need a reservation but we might have a chance at getting in as it was before 11:30. She was right!  The staff were all very professional and attentive. I was surprised actually how professional they were based on their age and \"look\". The recommended a couple of menu items and let us know the feature of the day.  I had one of their prime rib burgers. I'm a sucker for a good burger and this delivered. I added mushrooms and aged cheddar-so good. The burger is huge though so a) be hungry and b) its a little hard to eat neatly. The salad I ordered with it was ok ay(Caesar-real bacon) but the lettuce was too big to be bite sized. I thought perhaps they expected me to cut the lettuce but if that's the case, don't put the salad in a bowl.  My friend had the steak sandwich. She ate every last bite and said it was delicious. I was impressed by the presentation.  I found the prices reasonable based on how nice the decor of the restaurant was and the \"look\" they are going for there. I'd try it again.  One little item of note-they don't deliver the payment machine to your table and they don't take debit. They do have an ATM in site but come on-add debit and get portable terminals."}
{"text":"With a desire to continue trying as many rooftop patios before the summer washes away, I found myself with a group of friends at West. I was very impressed with the size and clean, simple look of this 15,000 sq ft patio. Even getting to the patio via stair case and long winding corridor with no roof was kind of interesting. I didn't order any food, but to be honest it didn't look like anything out of the ordinary of the jazzed-up pub staples. I just had the house organic brew, but really enjoyed the atmosphere up there. Nice place to people watch as well!"}
{"text":"When West opened a couple of months ago it was the talk of the town.  It was a perfect example of a restaurant that owed much of its successful opening to social media. They also teased opening Calgary's largest rooftop patio for The Calgary Stampede.....months later, it still has not opened.  And now with the days already getting colder, many people excited about the patio will likely have to wait until next summer.  Luckily West doesn't need to have a giant patio opened to be successful.   I really think it can just rely on its menu and great customer service.  Last time I ate there, I had the Butter chicken quesadillas and it was absolutely mouth-watering.  And once the kitchen closes, you can head upstairs and dance the night away.  Unfortunately the restaurant is located in the middle of a mall, which means instead of over-looking the city, you end up dancing outside of a Starbucks and a pharmacy.  In an interior designers nightmare, they've covered the huge windows with curtains to keep up the illusion of being at a really cool bar.  It doesn't always work.  I'm also happy to give a five-star rating for just the bathrooms alone.  I love them.  So clean, roomy and most importantly private.  Nothing more annoying than a sketchy bar bathroom."}
{"text":"I took customers to West for a business lunch.  Upon entering the restaurant, the first thing that I noticed  was....OMG it's HOT in here.  I am usually the person who is freezing so it is very rare that I am warm enough to even notice but it was boiling.  We had a table near the kitchen so it was even worse than other areas.  I also found the room quite loud so at times it was very hard to hear.  We started with the tempura prawns.  The batter wasn't like normal tempura as it had panko in it.  The prawns were tasty but unremarkable.  I found the coating quite hard and crunchy.  I prefer normal tempura.  My customers had the halibut & the crabcake and steak.  They said that both dishes were very good.  The halibut looked amazing.  If I  return to West, I will definitely try it.   I got the \"seared ahi tuna\".  I guess I missed the part after \"seared\" that said panko crusted.  To me seared in no way means fried but when my fish arrived it had a hard crunchy/fried exterior.  The fish was such a thick cut that it was completely cold in the middle.  I am used to rare tuna but normally it is at least warmed through.  Overall it tasted pretty good but I couldn't get over the weirdness.  Overall I would say that West is okay and worth another visit but it isn't somewhere that I would go out of my way to recommend to others."}
{"text":"West is decent for a night out...ONLY in the summer on the patio.  Otherwise stay away.  Food there is marketed and priced as high end fusion but is mediocre at best.  Service is very lousy.  The staff (especially the bouncers) are just plain rude and unpleasant.  Like most night clubs it's a pain dealing with line ups and the usual douchebaggery that comes along with the night club scene....but west takes it to a whole new level.  I parked in bow valley parkade and walked to the entrance from the plus 15...the bouncer promptly told me and my friend to walk all the way downstairs to the Stephen avenue entrance to get a stamp from the bouncers down there.  So we walked all the way down get a stamp..and then come all the way back up again and were finally let into the bar.  Of course it was summer time, so we wanted to go upstairs to the patio for drinks.  Once we arrived to the stairs to go to go to the patio we were told they were over capacity...and we had to wait.  Meanwhile \"VIP\"s were going up there by the dozen.  An HOUR later we finally get to go up.  At which time I gave the bartender by credit card for a tab for 9 dollar drinks....which I was billed for 8 weeks later...WTF?!?!?.    BTW if you are a smoker forget about it,  you have to go all the way down to street level,  and which point they won't let you back in without waiting in line.  Anyways the patio itself it gorgeous and the music was good.  However, the people running the place are amateur...at best. They are trying to make it like a Vegas club or something, but there is a problem WE AREN'T IN VEGAS  Get it together guys"}
{"text":"Last weekend a group of us went out for a night on the town. In the course of dancing the night away, we made a pit-stop at West.  West reminds me of a smaller version of Circa in Toronto.  It's got multiple floors, multiple bars, and beautiful decor. The crystal chandeliers beckoned my name...  Although we only stopped in for drinks and dancing and I therefore cannot comment on the food, I can say that the service was good. Non-alcoholic beverages were free at the beginning of the night and later on, they were only $3. Alcoholic beverages were priced similarly to other night clubs in town.  My one HUGE beef with West however is the size of the dance floor. It couldn't possibly be more teeny if it tried. And of course, EVERYONE wanted in on it, so slam about 100 bodies together on the tiniest dance floor you can imagine and what do you get? A night of dancing where no one has enough room to dance.  Needless to say, I was NOT impressed.  The decor is beautiful, but you can only look at it for so long before you want to hit the dance floor. And if this is the case, West most definitely isn't the place to go when you're lookin' to let loose and bust a move."}
{"text":"I dont understand why people are bashing on West. I have been there twice, and have enjoyed myself both times. The last time I was there, which was the past weekend, was a more thorough experience, as I stayed there for dinner AND the partying afterward.   Dinner was great. I had the wasabi-crusted ahi tuna, and it was delicious. Portion size was perfect, and the tuna itself was seared rare (read: raw). The whole plate was delicious. The martini I had on the size was also well-made and the prices were reasonable too. And service was friendly. My friend and I were actually being pretty annoying, as we were starving when we got there, and thus kept asking how long it was going to be till the food arrived. But the waitress was very sweet and took it all in good stride.  After dinner, we went upstairs to the bar/club area. It definitely is not a scruffy place. Expect to see everyone dressed up to the nines, and thus be prepared to dress up yourself. This is a good thing, in my opinion. We have enough places in Calgary where we can show up in jeans and sneakers. We need a few places like West in this city where we can show up in dressy clothes and not feel ridiculous. The dance floor got more and more packed and the night progressed. Music was alright, and the bartenders were quick and on the ball.  Most important thing to note about West though: No pretentiousness. From the time I stepped into the restaurant till the very end in the club area, I was met by friendly people. I was not once given the snooty shoulder, or subjected to any sort of pretentiousness. Not from the staff, and not from the customers. (I have had my fair share of snooty irritating behaviour in many Montreal clubs, and I can tell you what a thorough dealbreaker it is.) No such behaviour at West. Patrons were there for a genuinely good time, and staff was only too happy to comply.   Also note that this place gets a 5 stars not because it is the best resto-club I have ever been to (definitely not), but because it is perhaps the nicest resto-club in CALGARY that I have been to.   I will be back, and I will recommend this place to people looking for a fancier night out in this city."}
{"text":"Had never been here before, went here to go to the farewell party of an irrationally sweet and exuberant girl I had just met. After navigating several flights of stairs, followed by a concrete maze, we arrived at the rooftop patio. The view of downtown Calgary here is gorgeous.  After spending the whole ride there fretting that I wouldn't know anyone, turns out, a staff member knew who I was! Awesome. Service was quick and our waitress was friendly. The only comment I have I guess, is at the end of the night, she sort of half tossed/dropped the bill in the middle of the table and I was the only one that noticed. Five minutes later I hear, \"Oh! The bill is right here? When did it get here? How come it's not separated?\"   Also, I and some other people got a rather... biological show from a patron that I really could have done without. For all time. Although, that's not West's fault."}
{"text":"*Restaurant:  West expands onto three floors (plus 15 level, plus 30 level, and the rooftop). The decor is sophisticated with beautiful chandeliers, comfy booths, and warm hues. They also have several private rooms for larger parties. On a nice day, I highly recommend you sit outside on their rooftop patio where you get a great view of Stephen Ave and the surrounding skyscrapers.  My impression of the food menu is that there is nothing special about it - selection and prices comparable to the Metropolitan Grill with a few unique flavour combinations I haven't seen before. The rest of the menu is a little bit of everything such as soups, salads, sandwiches/burgers ($15-$20) , chicken ($21), ribs ($24), steaks ($21-$35), and seafood (Tuna, halibut, salmon) for ~$26+. From what I've observed, they change their menu items each season.   *Lounge/Nightclub:  The entire restaurant turns into a lounge/nightclub on the weekends. The crowd is a lot older, around 25+ and if you're a lady, expect to have at least one guy hit on you, stare at you creepily, or grind up on you.   When the patio is open, expect to wait in long lineups (Tip: Arrive 9PM or earlier for dinner to guarantee entry). There is one line to get into West, another to pay for cover, then one to get the rooftop. The bouncer will take your name and give you a number which will show up on screens. Make sure you pay attention to your number and if you go as a large group, ensure everyone is there at the same time. In the meantime you can hang out on the plus 30 level where you can sit down at one of their booths and have a drink or hit up the tiny dance floor. The music on Saturdays is top 40's, hip hop, and top songs from the past.    The rooftop definitely has a better vibe. Everyone is more laidback and the air is refreshing. There are 3 bars, all of which gets really crowded, VIP booths on the side, and a fairly large dance floor.  Beware... the drinks are overpriced and heavily watered down."}
{"text":"This review is for their \"night life\"   God what a waste of time. I've tried this place twice for the \"club experience\" and it's a complete waste of time and energy.   During the summer I wanted to take my cousin to a trendy place in Calgary - something comparable to Montreal. I knew well enough then that we better get there early - tried making dinner reservations for 8pm on a Saturday on the patio - not possible. Anyways, made it upstairs, it was really disappointing - absolutely no service. What was a bigger let down was the fact that their patio bar does not serve the same drinks as at the other bars in the institution - this was completely unheard of for me. Also, on a popular Saturday night I think it's a very poor reflection of the management/operations of this restaurant to not have all the recipe ingredients for your \"infamous\" cocktails. They were lacking ingredients for more than 3 different drinks.   I later tried ging here one time to enjoy the nightlife on the patio - it's very much like being a farm animal and being herded through a gate. When I go out to party I have to objectives, 1) dance 2) replenish at the bar. Both which were not possible. Knowing how pretentious and busy this place can be, I came in around 10pm - i'm sorry I do not have the patience to wait 40 mins to dance or buy drinks at a bar. I'll take my $$ elsewhere.   All in all, I think there's several other places in the city you can dress up for to go dancing and drinking. O - the crowd is so hit and miss here. Usually a miss for me - but that's always up to personal preference."}
{"text":"Dear West, Thank you for putting the axe to the 'audigier' , if you could work on the douchey pointed aligator shoes now... But dont worry, your milkshake is bringing all the hotties to the yard!  Pros: The office crowd, love your class and your money! Im glad your older and have jobs! The size! Bigger is better! The staff, you got a ton of them! The music.  Cons: Why so many rooms.. what am I missing? The dance floor (its a bit small) The guy who farted and took off... your nasty!  Basically if you like the 30 somethings this is your place... big enough for a social drink or a crazy dance party night."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, always in a large group - both business colleagues and family - and I have never been disappointed. I have booked a private room as well. Every time I received excellent service and the food was great. Fun drinks as well! Reservations are definitely recommended - especially for lunch!"}
{"text":"I had been to this place twice with friends. It was a good place for food and drinks. And this place turns into a night club around 12 midnight and not a great place as a night club.Choice of food is limited for Vegans. If you are going for appetizers and drinks then this is a good place."}
{"text":"the patio is really nice especially on a nice day. its huge. and right in the center of the city. awesome. the food is just ok. you get 1 lb of wings.... but thats like 8-9 wings. we ordered the siracha flavor. i thought it would be spicier. a little disappointed. and their \"truffle parmesan\" sauce had no hint of truffle! tempera prawns were yummie, but why are they so skinny? prawns are supposed to be big. and these were sticks.... prawns and shrimp are very different. false advertisement. it was supposed to be breaded in rice krispies which i thought sounded really interesting. while it was good, it just tasted like panko breading to me. the dipping sauce had a nice kick to it though. lobster mac and cheese was good but i wish it had larger chunks of lobster. i love gruyere cheese and with the bread crumbs on top, it added the perfect bit of texture the dish needed. overall, food was ok. nothing spectacular. and service started off really bad, but she got better half way through. portions are a lot smaller than america so i finished off an appetizer and entree myself. (i eat a lot). decent wine selection by the bottle, but not many options by the glass. they did have local beers though. overall, worth the trip if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to try West Restaurant and Bar.  it's located in the 2nd floor of Scotia Centre, across from Starbuck's.    The restaurant was bustling and very noisy during the lunch hour.  If you're thinking of having a nice quiet lunch hour, this is not the place to be.   Reservation is a must!  Foodwise - I like the BUTTER CHICKEN QUESADILLA consists of garam masala roasted chicken, red pepper, minted yogurt, and caramelized onions.  I had the organic greens.  So delicious!  I really liked it the asian fusion dish.  My friend ordered the SAKE SOY SALMON citrus poached salmon tenderloin, buttery garden vegetables.  The presentation was neat - it came out in a bamboo steamer basket.  She liked her meal.  Will I come back?  Sure but I wish I could sit in a quieter spot."}
{"text":"Service: 3.5/5 Food Quality: 5/5 Kitchen Speed: 3/5 Decor: 4/5 Value: 4/5  Perhaps I'm not the target audience for this restaurant.  This is poser central.  If you got your $400 jeans on and you want to be seen, this is as good a spot as any.  As for me, I was trying to have a business lunch and the client chose this place.  Food was well prepared and presented but was pretty slow for a downtown lunch crowd.  We waited 35 minutes for the dishes to arrive after ordering and they got my order wrong. Then they tried to fix it and got it wrong a second time. *Sigh*.  The decor is your standard wood trim, aluminum, black leather, and girls in tight skirts setup.  Probably a much better time if you're there with friends but only average for our business meet up.  Prices were pretty reasonable for downtown dining, that was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, if only for their rooftop patio. This place is a dream come true in every aspect except for service. My friend and I came here for a drink after work and it took us over 25 minutes to get drinks (a beer and a glass of wine) and the patio was by no means full. We ordered a quick appetizer and that also took an extended period of time. The food we did order was a cheese fondue and my-oh-my it was marvelous. Like I said the food, drinks, location and view were perfect, I'd give them 5 stars... but the service gets 1 star. If the bar is backed up or the food is taking a while at least come over and mention it to us. Instead our server disappeared, and we weren't the only table that noticed. The table beside us literally had to wave her down to get her attention. I'm willing to give West another shot, please don't disappoint me West!"}
{"text":"There's more to West than meet's the eye. From lunch to dinner, meeting space to club space, West has a variety of different spaces that can be transformed to meet just about any need.   The food at West is pretty tasty, and as Angela M discovered, West puts brie in its mashed potatoes. Its a divinely delicious addition. What's even better than the food though, is the watermelon lemonade. This drink is left to marinate for 24 hours with a sprig of rosemary before it's served. And it's worth every hour. I can't wait to drink it out on the rooftop patio next summer (crossing my fingers that it'll finally be open).  Tip: If you want to get into the club, go for dinner first. You get to try out those mashed potatoes for yourself and you avoid the lineup being that you're already inside."}
{"text":"I went with several friends to this restaurant for a friend's birthday celebration on a Wed noon.  Very nice restaurant but quite noisy since we sat in the middle area.  I had the Wed special - tempura halibut with panko prawns with fries.  Another friend also had this one and we found the halibut very smooth and tender - just right and also enjoyed the prawns with our meal.  Very good and will definitely come back to this selection again when I have a fish and chip craving. Our server was very friendly and even though it was busy , we had great service !   I will come back here again !"}
{"text":"This place is a \"meh\" for me. I usually yelp about how wonderful places are, but the front end staff are stuck up to say the least. And I'm not talking about getting up to the patio at 10pm at night when the line up is all the way down 8th ave. I went there for dinner and the hostess almost didn't even want to seat us at 6pm on the rooftop. She was hesitant and not very friendly at all. In fact all 3 of them weren't very inviting. When we finally got up there, our waitress was great. The food is ok, I've had better... but the atmosphere and being on that patio is actually what saves the experience. The hostesses are supposed to be the first face you see, hopefully they were all just having bad days and it's not a consistent thing at West."}
{"text":"This is definitely a good environment to party in when you have a crowd.  The food was decent, although it could be better.  I had the lamb burger which wasn't as fulfilling as I hoped.  I've been told to try the steak as that is one of the favorites of customers.  In the end, the waitress was too busy to get me my bill even after asking her twice.  For some they could just walk away without paying and nobody would notice, but I wouldn't feel right doing that so I paid.  I think this is something the restaurant could work on, and that is keeping track of customers' payment."}
{"text":"So I recently went to West for the first time on a nice sunny afternoon with a few girlfriends. We went with intentions of enjoying the sun on the patio.  I must first say that the patio is very nice indeed! It gets lots of sun and has walls up that block out the wind. There is plenty of comfortable seating as well as ample heat lamps and umbrellas if needed.   My complaint with West though is its pretentiousness. It gives off a very cold vibe and has a way of making a person feel somewhat insecure. Also it seems to be confused as to if it wants to be classy or trashy cause its a mixture of both. The de core and menu are on the classy side and they seem to attract a lot of the buisness crowd. Yet there were many trashy things going on at the same time . A lot of the servers were wearing bikini tops and some of them were even bouncing around in a kiddie pool bouncing a beach ball back and forth. There was also a male staff member wearing only swim trunks and water wings running around spraying vodka into peoples mouths with a water gun.....Nothing wrong with any of that but if you want to be that type of bar then be that type of bar. Don't pretend to have class.  However I must add that all of their slushy drinks on the menu were absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I've been to WEST on two occassions, both for completely different reasons.  1.  DINNER Went with my man for their Valentine's Day dinner.  They were very organized and had great service.  It was a special menu so not what you'd normally see from them.  I had a delicious lobster ravioli.   We had a large corner booth table, and we had a really nice time.  2. REWIND Fridays It is very difficult to find a place that will play \"retro\" music, aka music that is actually good to dance to.  It is extremely frustrating when something is marketed as RETRO and every ten songs you  might get an actual retro song, mixed in with garbage crap I could hear on the radio.  I asked the DJ to play more retro, and got a disgusted look and was completely ignored.     Quite unfortunate because I really enjoyed the vibe at WEST, the different rooms are beautiful and enchanting, and the layout is well done.   I will never go there for a night out because quite honestly they lie when they say REWIND Friday."}
