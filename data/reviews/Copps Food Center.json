{"text":"feel weird about rating a grocery store, but, couldn't resist! copps is awesome! as an illinoisian, didn't know what i was missing! fresh salad bar open during all hours as far as i can tell - many a lunch and dinner had here! so much to choose from! welcome alternative to fast food lunches during the workday! and awesome nuts/dried foot help-yourself selection! i'm usually a woodman's gal, but this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"It's my own fault for continuing to frequent this grocery store.  Rarely are there any baskets for shoppers to use.  Their is no mobile service so we can call home for last minute items.  The prepared food counter looks horrendous.  I wouldn't feed my pets with that food, during the dinner hour no less.  And when I asked a manager about the cracked, dried, nasty corn, she responded that the food is changed out daily.  Seriously??  And they are frequently out of things they normally carry.  If I go in for five items, I will on average walk out with three.  It's the closest store by a few miles for my neighborhood.  I wish a decent grocery chain would just buoy them out already.  They're TERRIBLE.  In fact, yesterday we just walked out without buying anything and then went and spent $60 at Hy Vee because they actually stock their shelves."}
{"text":"I do a lot of shopping at Copps because 1) it's close and 2) I usually frequent Copps as a change of pace from the smaller markets and co-ops.

As far as large chain grocery stores go, Copps has a wide selection in pretty much every food category, including a coffee stand, bakery, butcher, salad bar, and deli (whose workers are the most surly you've probably ever encountered). There's a selection of organic foods that is decent for a chain grocery, a good cheese aisle, and a well-stocked liquor section. 

Copps has weekly sales from time to time, often on its own line of products, but prices in general tend to be middle of the road or higher for your usual goods. Be sure to get a Copps card (its free) to take advantage of the sales.

If you have a chance, I've noticed the Copps on University on the westside is *much* more posh and has a better selection and display of its items, particularly the service counters (deli, bakery, etc.). Having visited this Shopko location after encountering the westside Copps made things look a little bit drearier..."}
{"text":"This Copps salad bar used to be the best cheap lunch on this side of town.  Since that guy Ryan left the deli, though, the quality has really slipped. 

Today the salad bar had shriveled broccoli slaw, black spots in the shredded carrots and black cauliflower.  The prepared salads looked dried out like they might even not be safe to eat.

Salad bar needs to be fresh - the is the basic and only requirement for a salad bar.  F- for Copps. I called to report it to the store assistant manager Chris who only grumbled that he had only just got to work and didn't know anything about it.  Well,  yah, that's why I'm reporting it to you...

With a new Hy-Vee right across the street and Metcalfe's open over in the Shopko plaza, I will never buy a fresh salad at this Copps again."}
{"text":"THANK GOD! I am sick of co-ops. One shop for everything food. I like plastic bags and large carbon footprints. I'm not going to martyr myself and pay more for a smaller selection for some pinko environmentalist agenda."}
{"text":"This place is alright. I stop here on my way to work to grab a couple of apples and a snack or two. Still kind of looks the same even though they have changed their name. I don't really see a significant change like I have the other Pick'n Save stores I've visited. The store is pretty old and it's nothing really exciting or fancy. This store is probably one of my least favorite ones."}
{"text":"It's a Copps. They generally have higher prices than I'd like, and I find their image-signs in the frozen food completely counter-intuitive, but it's clean, the food is decently fresh, and if we're in the area we'll stop in for a thing or two, but we won't go out of our way to go here. We'd much rather go to HyVee.

The service is so-so. No one outstandingly friendly, and no one outstandingly rude."}
{"text":"We have been shopping at this location since we moved into the neighborhood this past year. Copp's (the past year or two) has really gone down hill. We normally do our big shopping at Woodman's because it's cheaper. We'd go to this Copp's more but 1, the prices are higher MUCH higher than almost any place in Madison.

 Also they have a horrible time having things in stock. A lot of shelves are barely stocked (during the week even) and the signs in the frozen area are dumb, having lame pictures isn't helping me find products.  

If they updated a few things, had more things in stock and even regular items in stock I'd give a better rating. Also the parking lot is pretty dim/dark. Makes me feel unsafe."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot but Hy-vee opened up and now I shop between the two. Copps is cheaper but lately, the service has been less than average for me. I've found the wrong sale prices listed on my receipts, item prices not located in the correct places, and not getting the sale price if you don't have the store card or aren't asked for it at checkout. You have to have your game on when shopping here. 

If you live in the area, circulars and coupon booklets are usually mailed out. There are definitely good deals if you clip coupons but for some, you have buy certain quantities to get the sale price. I don't remember having to do so in the past so make sure you read the fine print. 

My favorite things to buy are the fried chicken (usually on sale for $6 for 8 pcs) and the not-really-but-good-enough-tiramisu slices of cake. The prices have gone up for tiramisu slices but not the german chocolate and carrot cake slices. The salad bar is pretty good too. The produce is decent but leaning towards being higher priced, but cheaper than Hyvee. You'll need to keep an eye on sales. 

The dairy section is freezing so I always have to remember to bring a jacket or avoid that area. They've remodeled and added a specialty cheese/meats and liquor area. 

Wednesdays and Saturdays are double coupons days. They'll double coupons up to the value of $1.00. So if you have a $1.25 coupon, they'll only double it to $2 not $2.50."}
{"text":"This store is going to close on or around May 15th, 2017. Hurry on over and scoop up some deals. Most items are 25% off. The salad bar and fish counter have shut down. The bakery is mostly closed, but there are many other good deals to be had. Candy bars are 50% off. Chips and pizza, milk were still full price today. Hopefully the discounts will increase as the closing date gets closer. I got a lot of food today for $80.00."}
{"text":"This store is fine and had a nice selection, but the fact that I can't use my phone to call about \"do we need this\" questions is unacceptable in this day & age.  Not even wifi so I could text.  

It's on an odd location with nothing but a soon to be closed shopko by it, but it's convenient to drop in on the way from the east side to the north side."}
{"text":"Lots of harsh reviews but I'm a local and I depend heavily on this store and I like it.  They always have really good deals some of the things I get a lot of: e.g. peanut butter, canned tomatoes.  It's not the greatest place to buy a green bell pepper, but I'm still happy going there."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill and will probably close like Shopko next store in the near future. Today all I needed was a head of cabbage, simple in and out right? NO! There were no cabbages to be seen under the tab for them, just a few loose leaves. I went to customer service and after waiting for the manager to quite bagging groceries and come to the service desk he announced over the speaker system for a produce person. I waited in vane for the person and actually went through the secret door to the back to look for him. Found no cabbages or the produce person. I then left the store and went to Woodman's, which I should have done first. The produce section is the worst of the store. Always low quality stuff and the shelfs  not stocked. Next, they put stuff on the canned goods shelves too hight for short people. Many times I have helped people reach stuff they wanted. There is never anyone around the store to ask except vendors, who are no help. The meat quality is good as is the bakery. Its just the crummy feel of the store and lack of any service that gives a bad impression. I do like the self check out area with four stations so you can get out of there without having to deal with that obnoxious female bagger with the name starting with M. The liquor store is nice as well. All in all I will drive the extra two miles or so and go to Woodman's and avoid the hassle."}
{"text":"Best place on the East side to get non-alcoholic beer, AFAIK, always in stock & they keep it cold in the cooler. The check-out people keep things moving & the store is clean. I like the store-brand organic dry goods / canned goods, an the bulk section is ok. The organic produce on the other hand is terrible. I have never seen so much moldy junk, or more beat-up looking fruit."}
{"text":"This review is for the hot food area. I would give 1 star but the 2 stars is for their effort. I had THE WORST meal of my life from the hot food area. Seriously. No joke. First off, the food was OLD. I had put together a number of things to satisfy my family. I got some onion rings (were chewy and COLD. Suppose to be crunchy), mozzo sticks (COLD not melted whatsoever just a hard block of cheese surrounded by breading), chicken strips (COLD), hot wings(COLD, hard, and old) , mac n cheese(COLD) Now mind you, I went shortly before they close up the hot food area which is at 7pm. As a paying customer, I expect everything to be satisfactory at ANY time the hot food is available. If you're food is dried out, cold, chewy by 7pm, you need to reevaluate how you do things man!! Or shut it down! Its just not good business. For the hot wings, I was told, you might as well buy the cold bucket and heat them up. What?? No. I came to get hot food because my family is hungry now and we want to eat it now. That is the purpose of buying hot food. There were no potatoe wedges. The woman said she could make some but it would take 15 mins. Cool. I had to grab a couple other things anyway. I come back 10 mins later, and she says someone already called and ordered wedges so she had no more. So why didn't she  just tell me that to begin with? I guess giving priorty to people over the phone is how they roll. Versus the person standing in front of you ready to pay. I used to work in customer service and was always told to put the customer in front of you before phone calls. I will never buy from the hot food area again. I come here occasionally to grab things I need which I probably won't do either. Unless I have to. I'm close to the University ave location too so I'll give them a try. Its usually fairly empty which is nice. It used to be much more busy before Hyvee moved in. I would think with Hyvee across the street and Woodmans not far, they would be on top of their game. Also, CHECK DATES on everything you buy. I've bought expired things from them before. Only time it was bad was when I bought 2 cartons of orange juice on sale. They still had a couple weeks left but smelled spoiled and tasted spoiled."}
{"text":"Slow, sloppy, careless customer service is what will prevent me from coming back, but the limited produce and exorbitant prices don't help their case, either. The atmosphere is even depressing--stark, over-bright. Thank God Hy-Vee moved in across the street."}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up some sale-priced chicken breasts but there were none to be found. The butcher said they burned through 12 cases over the weekend and he would have some restocked in one hour. I told him I was in need of chicken ASAP to make homemade chicken noodle soup for my sick little guy. He offered to mark down a package of boneless, skinless chicken breasts to $.99/lb for me. How awesome is that? Great service!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, Shopko Drive Copps, but I'm just not that into you. Something about this location just seems off. It's set up bizarrely, it's always dead, and it's the last holdout in an abandoned strip mall. 

I've been here a few times and it still hasn't grown on me. My latest trip sealed the deal. I needed a few things before throwing a party and was able to get everything I needed despite having to walk in a few circles because I still haven't gotten the set-up cemented in my head. There were only a couple lanes open for checkout, plus the self-check kiosks. We opted for the self-check, and it took so long. So, so long. Part of the problem was that not one, but two machines broke down in the process. The woman in charge of the area had to shuffle people over to the regular checkouts, which took an enormous amount of time. This was in part due to her actually shuffling - instead of shoes she opted for socks. Not okay. Yes, they were cute Packers knee-highs, but you still need real shoes, ma'am. 

When I finally got up the kiosk, the touch screen and scale were both wonky - it took me nearly twice as long to check out as usual because it kept not recognizing my items or what payment method I'd selected. 

I'm glad there's a store available in this area for neighborhood residents, but I will probably start going out of my way if I have to in order to have a better shopping experience."}
{"text":"I've experienced better at other Copp's locations and look forward to not patronizing this one due to the surly service received at the Customer Service counter regarding a raincheck. Folks complain of the Park St location and it's not aesthically pleasing but the service doesn't faulter. 

However, Lori - cashier is a 5 star lady with great service, best diposition and knows/values/appreciates the use of coupons and providign the bag discount. 

The seafood department lady - 4 stars especially once she learned of my 1st visit ever and told other co-workers. I went here out of convenince once because we were nearby at a practice but came back because everything was nice. 

The meat dept guy with the glasses - 4 stars. I appreciate people that take pride and respect in their work and he does. Random conversation about sausage but who cares - he took the time to ask me if I needed any help. Unfortunately, the customer service counter help ruined me on going back to this place. 

Plus, one shopper (and the seafood lady) returned my wallet to me as I left it on top of the season display in front of the seafood display case. 

While last night trip: a customer took it upon herself to waste time to passively agressively give me a \"parking ticket\" as she felt my vehicle wasn't nice enough to cross the line then write a note telling me \"I wasn't in a hurry. You couldn't fix this?\" 


Le Sign *** I can't wait to review good ole' Madison."}
{"text":"I feel like this is one of the older Copps, judging by the faded red on the shopping carts. It still has everything though.

For me, what sets this location apart from the one on Junction Rd is that this location has Lifeway kefir! I kept looking for it at the other location and couldn't find it.

I think the seafood selection here is pretty small though."}
{"text":"Over-priced but handy. Produce so-so. Hard to navigate. No bargain."}
{"text":"Agreed with others - good produce and clean store but your money goes much further at woodmans which is only 5 minutes away."}
