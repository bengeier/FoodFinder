{"text":"Great spot for brunch in the summer. There's a large patio area, and the windows are completely open for those shadier inside seats.   Menu is exactly what you'd expect for a breakfast/brunch spot - omelette, club sandwiches, egg Benedict & French toast.  Food was good, but nothing amazing or unique.   As lots of people have mentioned, the waiters don't check on you or refill your coffee unless you keep asking. However, I think this place has a super casual vibe and the low prices will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"I've been hesitant to post a review because I don't want to jinx it:  I really really like KOS.   A couple of weeks ago a friend invited us to meet him there for brunch.  [An aside: When we arrived, a gentleman with very loud opinions about everything was expressing them to the room at large. Then he cranked up his music player and put it on the table behind him, closer to us. The server handled the situation very professionally. She got him to turn down the volume and eat his meal quickly and peacefully.  It did not seem that she knew him, but she took care of things very smoothly.  Impressive!] We started with coffees which were refilled many times throughout the meal, something which I really appreciate and do not take for granted. Our friend had the omelet while we shared the Vegetarian Eggspress as well as  a bowl of fresh fruit with cottage cheese. The vegetarian breakfast comes with 3 eggs, toast, greens, rosti-style potatoes and your choice of sides. We chose the sauteed spinach, mushrooms and onions. The fruit bowl was loaded with kiwis, strawberries, melon, banana and blueberries.  Sooo good, and both were perfect for sharing. We went back a week ago just to have the Veggie Eggspress and bowl of fruit, and again the service was attentive and the food really yummy. Good food, good service, great value:  I like it."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience here waiting 50 minutes for my food, getting gross brown lettuce in my breakfast, and waitstaff who seemed really unforgiving and stupid.   Don't go here, there's many other options nearby."}
{"text":"My family and I went for dinner.  Avoid this place during dinner at all cost.  I ordered their \"pulled pork and carrot and cabbage chulut.\" This was one of their priciest items at 7.95. What I got was burnt pulled pork on a hamburger sandwich with lettuce. I protested to the waitress. She was very understanding. I asked her where is the carrot and cabbage chulut? She brought me sourkraut in a small dish. In the end I did not eat it and ended it giving it to my dog. The waitress was nice but the food was gross. My husband ordered the hamburger and he said it was too salty and caused him gas. One of the worst experiences ever. I gave it one star because the waitress was good."}
{"text":"Food is average to crap. I didn't eat mine and they comped it so I gave it an extra two stars for trying ..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for ambiance, this is not the place for you. But if you're looking for inexpensive greasy spoon fare, that is consistently good, stop on by. The interior of this place is lacking in pretty much everything. From the mismatched tables/ quasi booths to the single colour that seems to define the place, KOS doesn't have much of a \"feel\" to it. The patio, however is large, mostly shady and surprisingly quiet.   Service in general is good (although I have witnessed a waitress get into a fight so severe, one of the owners had to hold her back from attacking the incredibly rude customer) and they get pick up orders ready very quickly. Grilled cheese here is wonder bread with processed cheese (but sometimes, isn't that nice?) and BLTs are loaded with tons of meat. The chicken Caesar salad is a staple amongst my coworkers, which is surprisingly decent and a large has an entire chicken breast in it. French Toast with fresh fruit is a great deal - 3 slices (not halves, but actually pieces of bread) loaded with banana, strawberry, kiwi, blueberries, pineapple and melon. If you're looking for some comfort diner food, you're not going to go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The entire meal was delicious. And the waitress is SO nice. Defs coming back."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot for brunch with my friends & haven't been in a while. I recently went back and order steak and eggs. The eggs were disgusting and after telling the waitress, she said she could not give me a discount because she would have to pay out of her own pocket...it was just weird. If you like sketchy places to eat, this is the place."}
{"text":"Had brunch here over the weekend on the patio. Loved their pancakes. Our server was attentive and super quick. My boyfriend really enjoyed the $3 beers."}
{"text":"Dropped into KOS this afternoon.  I had a livingsocial coupon that was good anytime.  The owner apparently does not honor their commitments.  Was told that they will not take it on the weekends.  I travel during the week and was looking forward to trying the place but voted with my feet and left.  Dislike."}
{"text":"Had a regular breakfast, bacon, eggs, home fries and toast. It was delicious, especially the fried mashed potatoes. Also had a strawberry pancake that was so good. The waitress was really nice. Nice location too. Big windows."}
{"text":"Went in this afternoon hungry and was very disappointed. Greasy spoon is not hard to do simple and well, I ordered can't talk eating a three egg breakfast with pancakes. The toast was cold, butter didn't even melt on it.  The eggs I ordered easy over and they were cooked right through, and the pancakes were tough (!) which means precooked, cooled down, and microwaved. Oh and the waitress was fairly inattentive not checking for coffee or water refills.  If you need a good freshly done breakfast this place is not it."}
{"text":"Relocated from College and Bathurst, this greasy spoon is a welcome addition to Kensington Market, especially in the summer with its huge patio.   I order a Greek salad and french fries every time I go there."}
{"text":"1.5* I went to KOS after reading all the god reviews on Yelp, but I was very disappointed.  Going there for brunch on a Friday afternoon, I opted for the egg and bacon sandwich with fries as my side.  The fries were good, albeit one or two seemed raw. But the sandwich was terrible.  The bread was dry, and the eggs didn't taste all that good. The bacon was second rate, and it was somehow fused with the eggs.  The place was very empty, with roughly two other tables besides myself, yet service was a little slow.  Price wise it is pretty reasonable, but it's not enough to get me back to try other things..."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this little hip joint on Bellevue Avenue. Not to be confused with the other sketchy Kos diner somewhere on Bathurst with a fish tank that serves rotten frozen strawberries in their pancakes.   It's cheap, the service is great and it's in a cute little space right in the heart of the Kensington Market. I had a cheese omlette and they were so liberal with the cheese that I had to pull out chunks of it at a point to save me from od-ing. My friend who has an appetite of champions got the Can't Talk, Eating special and she let me sample some of her french toast. To say the least I had some and went straight to heaven.   On good days you can seat yourself on the patio and enjoy their milkshakes which looked amazing.   All in all, most excellent. Going there at the next possible opportunity."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard greasy spoon brunch place.  I had the Eggspress brunch which consisted of three eggs, pea meal bacon.  It was pretty tasty but nothing really stood out for me.  I still prefer Cora's."}
{"text":"Super laid back with a diner feel and menu - nothing fancy. Breakfast was cheap, tasty, and came out super quick! It's nice that they have the option of beans, fried tomatoes, or spinach and mushrooms for veggies. As a big supporter of all-day breakfast, I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just came for brunch. Served up a tasty Greek omelette ($8.95). Came with toast and homefries. The homefries were surprisingly tasty, made with fried onions and a little mashed. Different and better than your usual diced potatoes affair. You can also get the standard 3 eggs, toast, potato and meat for $6.   It's nice to find an unpretentious brunch spot with an unpretentious price."}
{"text":"What a terrible and disgusting restaurant! It was very dirty and the food was tasteless and oily. It took them 40 minutes to bring our salad and our food! They had only one person in the kitchen in busy afternoon. However, one the waitresses called Rachel was so nice and caring.  Please save your money and do not eat here!"}
{"text":"The worst burger that I've ever had : chicken burger patty from no frills and no name frozen fries.  My friends ordered breakfast and an 8 year old could do better at home, unsupervised.. This was the worst restaurant experience I've had in Toronto. It was a rip off.  Fool me once, fine. Never again.  Don't go there"}
{"text":"This was my fourth visit, and it's been consistently good. The ambiance leaves a bit to be desired, and the tables are kind of tight, but the food is good and plentiful here at KOS.  I had the \"Veggie Eggspress\" which was \"3 eggs any style with choice of: grilled tomato, baked beans, salad or saut√© spinach with mushrooms and onions\". The waitress recommended the spinach, and it was excellent. Not overdone and tasty.  The regular \"Eggspress\" (which is basically their breakfast special at 5.95), contains \"3 eggs any style with choice of: bacon, ham, sausage, peameal bacon or hot Italian sausage\". Both are served with home fries, fresh fruits (cantaloupe, orange and grapes) and toast.  The home fries are excellent, and include onions - which may seem like an obvious ingredient, but is sadly missing in most diners in this town. Coffee is extra.  One friend had the above with the sausage and highly recommended it. My other friends had the Huevos Rancheros, one regular and one vegetarian. They both liked them a lot.  The menu also contains a number of \"fancier\" options* which raises it a step above the average greasy spoon. All it needs is a Restaurant Makeover.  *like Eggs Bennie, Eggs Florentine and Eggs Salmonnie."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago while visiting Toronto from LA... And I have to say it was a nice environment being outside on a really nice summer day. After we sat down, it must've taken about 10 minutes for someone to actually get to us but luckily we were in no rush, otherwise we would've been a little irritated. Our server (can't remember her name) was a little interesting but was friendly and recommended a few items to us. We received our meals and I enjoyed every bit of it. The pancakes were very good as well. I would come back here again if I find myself in Toronto. Make sure you find close parking because there is a 2 hour limit on those streets surrounding the place. If you decide to walk around the \"hip\" neighborhood make sure you give yourself enough time to sit down at the restaurant because the parking enforcement is no joke there from what I heard.   Anyways, will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I lived downtown for just over 2 years and this was our spot. We actually had our first breakfast together here when we first met and it quickly became our go to place. The staff is just wonderful, so friendly and fun! And the food is amazing! Fair prices and hearty portions of delicious home-cooked food. I have trouble eating in restaurants due to stomach issues but this place has never affected me negatively! A breakfast from here would fill me up until dinner, just fabulous! This is the only thing I miss about living downtown and we try to go back any chance we get :)"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of restaurants that are consistent enough to bring people back and responsible enough to get and keep their liquour licenses. Given the location of KOS, with nothing around that compares, I am a fan and hope they keep going and going. The interior reminds me of a quaint spot in cottage country with a menu to match. Nothing out of the ordinary, but their omelets deliver and their home fries are perfect. The patio had a lineup on the first long weekend of the patio season. With its grandiose shade tree canopy above and being in a residential neighbourhood, with plenty of people watching potential, their patio is one of my all time favourites."}
{"text":"God, I love this place. I'm actually surprised (and a bit embarrassed) I haven't reviewed it before. Put frankly, it's breakfast sex for your mouth.  Went this morning and got their Spinach Omelette just loaded up with leafy green spinach and a perfect middle layer of feta cheese. My friend got the Eggs Salmonie and absolutely loved it (I've had them, as well as the florentine, and they are both change-your-perspectives amazing).  The service is always kind and I usually mark this place as the last place to go before a friend leaves town, as it's such a great and positive experience.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"KOS, when applied to the service, should stand for \"kind of shit\". To begin, my water cup smelled like fish (my brunch companions can attest to this fact as well), which was a bit nauseating. I'm not sure if our waitress was just having a bad morning or simply wasn't suited to the service industry, but she was a bit of a mess. She forgot my drink, and got a bit sassy when I asked her to cancel it since everyone else had gotten their drinks and our food was already out. She had to come back to the table to check on drink orders for other people in our party because she \"couldn't read her own handwriting\". We repeatedly asked for pepper and hot sauce and she forgot every single time, so I eventually just got up and walked across the restaurant to grab them off another table. The wrong food was sent to our table initially, and when she brought out the right food, she kept up the sass by insisting that another breakfast companion should take one of the dishes because she had ordered it (spoiler: she hadn't ordered it). When it was finally time to get our checks, she said she was going to figure out our checks from memory (at this point, it clearly wasn't going to go smoothly), and proceeded to bring them out two at a time, with 5 minutes minimum between each trip (there were 7 of us, so this took quite a while). There were additional charges on my bill that shouldn't have been there, but at least she removed them when I asked about it. The food was decent and the prices were reasonable, so I left a couple stars."}
{"text":"Great little spot in the west end of Kensington Market. The best part of this cozy restaurant/bar is the massive patio. It houses probably in the vicinity of 35-30 people, and runs along Nassau, a quieter road off of Bathurst.   The food here is solid as well, burgers nachos and all day breakfast! My only quam is that they don't serve J√§germeister :("}
{"text":"Breakfast/brunch was decent. Nice sized portions. Nothing worth raving about, but decent.The watermelon as a garnish was a nice touch. My main gripe is about the lack of cold bevvies in the morning. No iced coffee. No milkshakes (not served at 12:30pm on a Saturday is seems), no unsweetened ice tea, only the canned nestea variety. Too bad. On a hot patio a nice drink would have been appreciated. $3.50 for a fresh squeezed OJ which is half ice.  Breakfast and juice came to about $15 with tax and tip"}
{"text":"Called today to order a lunch for pickup as I work in the market but only get a short 30 minute lunch and like to spare myself waiting while they prepare my meal. I have done this many, many times before and several times in the past two weeks. When I called today to place my regular order I was informed they no longer take phone orders because of \"dining and dashing\". I asked how long this was in place, and she told me for at least three weeks. This is obviously a blatant lie as I have done so several times in the last three weeks. And secondly, not sure how I would go about dining and dashing from a pickup order as I can't eat the food until I pay. I'm not going to waste my time running over to their restaurant and waiting half my lunch for them to prepare my food. KOS needs to reconsider their customer service and \"policies\" if they want to utilize their fellow market businesses. Their food is mediocre at best and was mainly used out of convenience. I'll spend my dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about this place - the service is so bad that it's almost like being on a comedy set. You can't honestly believe that they could be that ridiculously incompetent. But as soon as you kind of accept that fact and don't let it get to you, the food is decent for fairly cheap, the location is good, and the clientele is sweet. But the service - I mean, it'll bring tears to your eyes. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Wonderful and friendly service. My mother and I had mentioned we were in a hurry and they did their best to accommodate us which was very nice.   We ordered breakfast and it was very yummy. The potatoes weren't all that great for homefries. I like mine crispy but it was still good. The bacon was excellent as well .   All in all 4/5 due to the potatoes."}
{"text":"Serviceable brunch and booze place in Kensington. Surprised I've never rated it, considering I've been coming here for 5 years on and off. I used to live down the street and this was the go to place for greasy breakfast after a late night.   Was here recently for beer. Service was friendly but inattentive and the patio was quiet. Was nice to be able to get a seat (unlike Ronnies down the road)"}
{"text":"Kensington area is full of culture and has great small, affordable restaurants, KOS being one of them. I have come here twice already and have no complaints about the food or customer service. I ordered the eggs benedict the first time I came to KOS and it was awesome. This time I grabbed the chicken souvlaki and enjoyed it aswell. What I like about this place is that they fill up your plate so your getting your moneys worth. Most of my friends like to recover here from a long night out and just enjoy some good ol' breakfast. One thing I recommend is that they wipe down their tables and chairs more properly since the table feels sticky. Also, this restaurant could use a face lift, it feels like your eating in someones garage. As long as they keep up the great food and customer service the ambience doesn't bother me too much. Will come back here soon :)"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place!!! I've eaten here twice now, and after trying a new place around the corner (Tasty Corner- Never Eat There) this place was a lifesaver. The food is great, the servers are nice, and the price is reasonable. Only reason it's not a 5 is because there's nothing that makes it really stand out, but it's still a really solid place to eat. :)"}
{"text":"i went with a friend for food and drinks after work on the 'pedestrian sunday'.. we sat on the patio since it was so nice out. my friend had a couple of beers which were about $4 each including tax.. so not bad..   i had a vodka and cranberry i think it was about the same price.. then i had their club sandwich and the waitress was great letting me switch to regular bacon.. i had salad instead of fries.. it was about $7-8 and it was a good portion and decent quality food.   another friend joined us for a bit and all the staff were great checking in on us and clearing the table. i would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent prices. The food is good. I like a dish named sincronizadas; a yummy sort of quesadilla!"}
{"text":"This is an okay place. It's good because there's a large patio, though they really pack it in tight. The drinks are average priced, the service, too. It's a very average but reliable place to go for some drinks on a patio. Standard pub fare at standard pub prices."}
{"text":"we wanted to sit on a patio with few friends after the PS Kensington festivities finished. this one was one of the few places with semi packed patios where we could find a table for all of us.  we mostly ordered only drinks. Sangria pitcher is $25 and the sangria is yummy!  but the best is the staff! they were super friendly and weren't getting annoyed at either our loudness or our constant switching between patios and indoor sitting (first we didn't see the table outside, then we went back in when it became colder)"}
{"text":"Excellent place for having beers! Excellent waitresses.  Ask for Anita! She will treat you so nice!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised by how good this place was. The eggs and home fries were pretty standard, nothing crazy special but good nonetheless. I thought the French toast was amazing though. I usually find the pancake/french toast option at restaurants is usually lacking but it was delicious!! Especially eaten in conjunction with the sausages. The patio was really nice as well, although the birds are VERY confident so if you don't like them very close I would suggest sitting inside. The coffee was okay but the service was good. :)"}
{"text":"KOS is an enjoyable and homie experience. With a reasonable price, it's decent value for the quantity and quality of food. However, it's nothing extraordinary and nothing stands out on the menu. The french toast is a winner and the other breakfast items are standard.  Admittedly, the space is cute and the service is great. So nothing is wrong but nothing is special either. If you're looking for a good breakfast with good value, come by Kos. You'll go there and realize it's charm for yourself."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Toronto.  After a thoroughly disappointing breakfast at Aunties and Uncles nearby the day before, we tried KOS the next morning.  Yelp reviewers got this one right.  Eggs cooked to perfection and best strawberry pancakes ever.  The food came out timely and hot.  Portions are large and prices very reasonable.  Our waitress Nana was personable and attentive. She even helped us to plan our day of sightseeing.    KOS is a charming little restaurant in the eclectic Kenningston Market neighborhood."}
{"text":"I went to have breakfast at KOS Restaurant about 2weeks ago, as I hadn't been there in quite a while. As with previous visits, both food and service were fine, so I am a bit surprised about some negative comments about service in other reviews. The restaurant is located just on the western edge of Kensington Market, has a large outdoor patio with umbrellas and bright red furniture, and a small bar that separates 2 bright rooms inside. The waitress was very attentive, and the food came fairly quickly.  I ordered the Veggie Eggspress, which is the usual eggs-homefries-toast breakfast, but I had it with baked beans and salad instead of any meat. The other options are bacon, ham, sausage, mushroom or grilled tomato; so something for everyone. Everything was fine, especially the baked beans. The homefries come with onions, which I don't care for, but they are easy to pick out so no complaint. The coffee was hot and re-filled regularly, and was included in my meal since it was before 12noon. I had Huevos Rancheros for the first time on my previous visit, and it was nice and spicy and very filling. They also serve pancakes and waffles, salads, sandwiches and burgers, and some pub-style dishes like chicken fingers or nachos.  Overall, a nice place to get a decent breakfast on a quiet Monday morning. My total bill was only $8 because the coffee was included, but many other choices could be had for about $10-12. I would certainly return for breakfast, and maybe drop in to see what the evening setting is like also."}
{"text":"This is a good place for breakfast/brunch. There's nothing fancy on the menu... if you want fancy brunch I recommend By the Way Cafe in the Annex, or Coquine near Yonge & Eg... these guys have simple foods done pretty well served by friendly folks at a reasonable price.    As well their burgers are pretty good, as is the kebabs. If you go in summer there's also a good sized patio!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is the only thing keeping my review above 1 star. Today my party of 3 had some of the worst service we have ever had at a restaurant.   It took about 30 minutes and multiple inquiries about when we could order until another waitress told us that our original waitress was really busy and that she would take over for her. It was frustrating to see other tables that arrived later than us receive their food before we were even allowed to order but it got worse from here.  It took more than an hour to get our food. Our frantic replacement waitress apologized over and over, offering to pay for our drinks out of pocket. What we really wanted was for KOS to pay for them but when asked if a manager would be able to grant us that, we were told that there was no manager present and no way to be reimbursed for our 2 hour wait other than taking our waitresses salary.  You may not have the same experience at KOS but it is worth noting that if you do there is no one present to take responsibility for it. We paid our full bills, tipped the apologetic waitress, and left with no intention of ever returning."}
{"text":"I like this place for breakfast on the weekend.  The prices (aside from the \"Can't talk Eating\" breakfast mentioned by Roy) are average.  They also serve fresh squeezed OJ which is a breakfast must have for me.  The main advantage that this place has over other weekend brunch joints is that you can actually go there and have a meal without a 20 minute lineup.  You will be elbow to elbow with hipsters talking about politics though so suck it up.  Incidentally, there is a guy that lives next door that makes a daily trip to the store in his bathrobe, slippers and dangling cigarette.  Extra points if you spot him."}
{"text":"In inexpensive, cheerful breakfast place in Kensington Market, only marred by the smokers who surrounded me. Oh well.  The food was delicious and I appreciated the side of fruit to complement the eggs and bacon!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and it has one of the best patios! It's huge, but it's so nice to lounge about on a sunny summery day.   I had gone here for brunch occasions and would come here again. Roughly around $10 for a plate and it's good.   KOS wouldn't exactly be the first place I would go to in Kensington though. Nothing really pops out too much to me, but I would stop by every now and then if I'm craving a traditional breakfast/brunch.   The servers are friendly and it's a nice place to check out (especially the patio!!)!"}
{"text":"KOS is one of my frequent cafes. Everything on their menu is probably good, have yet to get something I didn't like. It is a really big space, surprisingly big, and they wisely separate a laptop/work side from a laptop-free side. The line is usually out the door, which is technically a good sign, but can make for a longer wait as the staff isn't always the most attentive. But the food is worth the wait, and the coffee (their own roast) is exceptional! My one actual issue is the $10 credit card minimum, but oh well"}
{"text":"This place is a good option for standard brunch food in Kensington. It has a nice patio for enjoying the summer weather. They changed the menu recently however, so I was a bit less satisfied this time around than the many times before. They don't offer entree salads anymore...."}
{"text":"Friendliest breakfast in town. Best for hungover tea and a good book. The patio is beautiful as are the lovely waitresses  It's not fancy but it's family"}
{"text":"Small out of the way place located on the fringes of Kensington Market. Didn't really know what to expect as it has a mix of ethnic and North American foods on its menu (sometimes a sign of a jack of all trades but master of none) but the food here is surprisingly good. I got the fish and chips which is their Friday special and it was perfectly battered and came smith a small salad and cole slaw plus their own custom variety of cole slaw, all for $10-12. Fries were golden and delicious as they should be, wait time was minimal. Pints were cold and they had a good variety for a place that doesn't deal with the volume of a Fionn McCools. Total for the meal was about $14-15. Very reasonable.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Good prices, good service and consistent food. I'm not a foodie by any means but I make a point of stopping by once a month because they serve with a smile even when rammed. My thing is Sunday brunch, so maybe you want to go after their 12 noon rush. And yes their patio is a bonus, but the modest, or simple, clean interior is quite perfect for me. As for the food, well I especially like the spicy Italian sausage as a substitute for bacon ;) Ok, it's not too spicy but just enough."}
{"text":"Breakfast food was decent but the service wasn't the best. You should never have to ask multiple times for something. Also there's no reason the bacon should come out when you're half way done with your food. Wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Small & cute cafe. Breakfast was very good. Outdoor seating was a definite plus. Freshly squeezed OJ definitely overpriced. Waitress was nice, but never came back to check on us nor refill our coffees. We asked another waitress for coffee, but she ignored our request yet brought coffee to her own tables. Also had to track her down for our check. Customer service needs a little work, but overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential to be  5 star restaurant but I think that there if something that is preventing it from being all it can be.  First, it took forever for our food to come out, and once it did it was only half of our entree; it took 10 minutes for our pancakes to come out to find that they were undone (mushy on the inside). Our waitress asked if I wanted to have some more prepared but I declined; I didn't want to wait for another 10 minutes on pancakes!  Home fries were superb!! It was the only thing that prevented me from leaving totally unhappy. Luckily I was able to get full on my saut√©ed spinach, homefries, eggs and toast.   Although the restaurant was pretty empty (only my party of 6, and two more party's of 2) there was only one front of house person doing all the work. Perhaps only one person was cooking in the back as well which accounted for the slow food and rushed pancakes that were undone."}
{"text":"What ever you do, don't get the \"Can't Talk Eating Breakfast\" item. At $10.95, it's $5 more than the special. The difference? You get 2 slices of french toast.  Yes, 2 slices of French Toast for an extra $5....  Average food. But somehow paying $16 for breakfast (inc. tax & tip) seems a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place isn't fancy, but it doesn't claim to be.  Service is friendly enough, and the outdoor seating is fantastic.  Located in a great spot, the quiet end of Kensington Market, so I likes it!"}
{"text":"Good big patio which is good for groups. Breakfast all day. Reasonable prices. Good portions and tasty food. Pretty solid place to go. Maybe not a place you take the parents to when they are visiting from out of town. But a place to go hang out with a large group of friends definitely.  I had the fish n chips which were good. I just wish there was two pieces of fish or a two piece option. Other than that no complaints!"}
{"text":"It's a university bar and all day breakfast place. you can get a full breakfast eggs, bacon, sausage, toast and salad for $8.   Ask your server for recommendations and they're honest about what's good and not on the menu.    This is our regular breakfast place, for it's simplicity and cheap prices. And they have a huge patio!"}
{"text":"Surprised this place only had a three star rating. Was in Toronto for four days and came for breakfast here twice. The food was excellent especially Huevos con Chorizo. Great outdoor patio spot for the warm weather. I'll be visiting again my next time in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food was great as usual, however the was below standards.  I have been eating here for years and usually get great service, not so much today.  I had to ask for pancakes that were not provided with the rest of meal and to make matters worse my friends and I were asked to leave after only being there for just over an hour.  The excuse given was that is was brunch and they needed the space I guess the empty tables around us were unavailable for some reason that we could not fathom.  If KOS is now putting time limits on the length of time a guest can stay in their establishment then is should apply to everyone.  They didn't ask the guy at the next table with his laptop leave and he was there before us."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. Surprisingly we didn't have to wait despite it being a busy day. Most people were sitting on the patio. It is also a kid friendly place. There were quite a few families sitting on the patio. Service was somewhat slow possibly because it was also quite busy.   The best part is that they serve alcohol and have pretty good cocktails/margaritas. I had the Bellini and my friend had a Caesar. We were both happy with our drinks. Both had decent alcohol content to them. I'm giving it an extra star for having alcohol and no line ups on a busy sunny Saturday.   The food wasn't exceptional but was quite tasty. I had the salmonnie which came with two eggs and smoked salmon. I especially liked the hollandaise sauce, which was quite creamy and the tangy taste was just right.   I would return but maybe I will try their omelettes and pancakes next time though."}
{"text":"Kos is the perfect breakfast place to treat a hangover.   The prices are right, the menu has a good selection (breakfasts and delicious burgers - my personal fav is the Tex Mex Burger with salsa and sour cream), and decent service. They also have a list of breakfast cocktails, which honestly, aren't that great, so I wouldn't recommend them (I can make an orange juice and vodka at home - and they all pretty much taste just like that).   Sure, it might not be the classiest place (I've sat at a table with a fried egg underneath it) but greasy-spoons don't generally scream \"class\" anyway!   Also - on sunny days, definitely worth going to sit on the patio!!  After a night of partying, Kos is my go-to in the morning!"}
{"text":"The place is nice and they have a big patio. However the food portions are pretty dmall and sub par."}
{"text":"Best Service anytime. The best place to have a good meal with fair price in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"The experience of eating at KOS is fine, but if you get an egg mcmuffin and go to a walk-in clinic you'll spend less and get a check-up out if it.  Update! KOS has a nice wooden patio and a new interior that is much more pleasant. They serve Amber beer for $12 a pitcher. It's drinkable if you put salt and/or Tabasco, which gives to whole thing a nice severe bladder infection theme....Not totally abandoning my original sentiment. Really nice waitress this time though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Kensington market. I had a very delicious vegetarian sandwich for $6. Grilled eggplants and bell peppers with cheese. I had a Philly cheese steak in past, and it was pretty decent for $7.  In the evenings they serve pitchers of Amber Larger or Amsterdam blonde for only $10. They also make margarita, sangria, and tequila sunrise."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm not giving them a 1 star is because they brought the food warm. I ordered avocado Benedict and chocolate chip pancakes. The poached eggs in the Benedict tasted sour as if they weren't fresh. The avocado definitely had a weird color. The pancakes have a raw egg taste. It's very obvious they use super cheap ingredients for literally everything. Would definitely not recommend, no matter what."}
{"text":"we ate at the kos everyday for breakfast.  the eggpress is great 3 eggs, choice of meat,toast,homefries and salad for 6.99 cant be beat it was great. my wife also has their sandwiches which she said was very good.  not fancy just good food and a good beer selection with outdoor dining.  the waitresses were very nice and did a great job even when busy"}
{"text":"An amazing restaurant where many locals go to eat. I actually ran into my tour guide dinning with his friends. It's on the edge of Kensington Market. Right in the middle of everything! A few blocks from Toronto Western Hospital. I came here with a classmate before a presentation we had the hospital.  They have outside seating. The prices are amazing. They serve \"Traditional\" Canadian breakfast. Service is fast! They also serve lunch!"}
{"text":"In touch with the ground  I'm on the hunt I'm after food  Scent and a sound. I'm lost and I'm found  And I'm hungry like the wolf.*  After running the Yonge St 10K in a blistering 47 minutes, I was ready to eat some food.   I met my Canadian friend at Aunties and Uncles, only to be told there was an hour wait.  Due to my stomach growling like the aforementioned wolf, we needed a plan B.  Plan B was to be Maggies, but that didn't work so onto Plan C.  According to Yelp, there was a place called the Bellevue that sounded good, but got there and it looked abandoned...newspapers all over the windows.  So Plan D was right across the street.  KOS Restaurant!  Got a seat right away.  Waitress was nice but forgetful.  Took a long time to drinks and coffee.  Food was good.  I had choco chip pancakes (real maple syrup would have been nice rather than the \"pancake syrup\" stuff in the plastic container) but they were good.  My buddy had eggs, toast and bacon and some type of ham which he said they call something else in Canada.  It looked good and he enjoyed it.  Cocktails were weak.  Prices were reasonable, so I can't complain.  Solid food, friendly service.  Hey it satisfied my hunger so I was no longer like the wolf.  It's A-OK in my book.      ----------------------------------------------- * my apologies to Duran Duran  http://youtu.be/oOg5VxrRTi0"}
