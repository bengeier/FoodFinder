{"text":"Was driving by this place on a sunny weekday afternon and out of the corner of my eye saw STUDIO...it looked pretty cool, so I made an illegal turn and parked out front.  I get pretty excited to see cool places pop up in Mimico, and this place has a good feel about it.   Original art on the walls, laid back sleek couch hang out spots, tables to have a coffee and a pastry.  Totally so unlike typical slum mimico venues, this place was airlifted from someplace way cooler and dropped on Lake Shore Blvd. West.  Fantastic espresso machine and an artsy rive gauche cafe vibe.  Advertising live music on a board outside.  Immediately knew I was coming back.  

Made it on Friday night, couple of bands were playing:  a forgettable folksy duo with a romantic backstory, and  Denielle and her Daddies - double bass, sax, guitar, drums.  Did Edith Piaf and some unusual covers quite brilliantly.  Husband liked the Edith Piaf  I did too, but I really loved Anthropologie ... the band was tight --- impressive to see this level of talent in a small venue.  

 We weren't planning on eating but thought we'd try a dessert, but wasn't meant to be. The place would have sold tons more food and drinks if a waiter  was available to move about and check on tables. Unfortunately, the waiter was also the  cook (Carol is her name) and we couldn't get her attention.  Had to walk up to the bar twice and try to get someone to mix us cocktails.  I was drinking a martini off their menu called the Salvador Dali which was pretty good, but guy behind the bar didn't know what it was (it was off their menu) so clearly Carol was also the bartender.   When it came time to do the bills Carol was clearly torn because her math was suffering if the next table was representative. 

This restaurant/cafe/music spot loses a star on service and one other major irritant.  The open kitchen.  The extract fan is insufficient for the job of extracting a commercial kitchens fumes, which were billowing out overhead. The smell at times was overpowering.  Either they need to get a commercial fan, or they need to close in that kitchen area or relocate it to the basement.  

I'm giving it 4* because I think this is the coolest thing to happen to Mimico since the skating path."}
{"text":"went here on a groupon for  two 3 course steak dinners. It is an artsy jazz bar. Not really set up for steak dinners. Our waitress was also the chef. The host who may have been the owner seemed friendly. The salad was very sparse. The steak was tasty. Might go back for jazz and a drink maybe some wings but not for a steak dinner."}
{"text":"The Gallery Studio Cafe is a new-ish venue in the West end.  We came to check out a friend's band during the Tuesday night jazz jam.

Food menu was available from their open air kitchen but we had already eaten.  Would have liked to order a drink though but wasn't noticed by the waitress who also doubled as the chef.  Saw a few people get up and order drinks directly at bar from the manager.

The Cafe's proximity to Humber College attracts students from the jazz program during the open jam so if you're into seeing new music talent, this is a good place.  Paintings and photography from local artists line the walls of the Cafe.  It's nice to see that the arts community is being supported here.

An interesting venue in an area not really known for culture or music."}
