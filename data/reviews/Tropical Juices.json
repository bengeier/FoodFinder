{"text":"The smoothie I got was ok. I got the unicornio. Lacked flavor. Plus the service took forever. The juices look good though. This place has a very weird ambiance also, very quiet with unhappy employees that never smile"}
{"text":"Yelp users, hear me! This new local business needs our support. They've certainly earned a great review on this most recent visit. Family owned and operated, this  business is just weeks old. They've certainly let their creative genius flow with fresh paint job and Caribbean style layout. Salads and tropical smoothies will not disappoint. Enjoy your vacation! ;)"}
{"text":"Waited outside for 10+ minutes, decided to leave at 850am; doors are locked and place is empty. Nearly an hour after they're supposed to open according to their hours of operation sign on THEIR door, and posted on google maps and yelp. Really wanted to try this place due to the great reviews! Open to changing my review once I actually get to try it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best juice bars in town! I will be a regular customer and once you visit this place you will never go to Jamba Juice again!"}
{"text":"5 minutes ago I was wishing for a great juice bar I could grab an acai bowl for brunch. Ive been eating toouch fast food lately on my busy schedule and was craving something healthy and cold on this hot day.   I could think of anything so I decided to go Hawaiian and stop into Ono's.  When I pulled up, it was obvious the juice gods were sending me a message. Right next door is this new fabulous establishment with swinging chairs, picnic tables, fresh fruit smoothies and bowls with local honey.  Pomegranate salad and Hawaiian Tortas to boot!  I found my new staple"}
{"text":"I feel like the place had potential but I waited a very long time for just a salad and when they gave it to me they just handed me a bowl..no bag or utensils or a napkin. Then I got it back to work and started to eat it and bit down hard into an unpitted cherry and found that there were several in the salad that were not even listed in the ingredients."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this place and will have to say this  will be my new to go juice bar plus they got plenty of other good food/snacks.  It's a nice cozy place very welcoming environment and very relaxing. I ordered the pomegranate salad and a green juice both were very delicious and fresh just what I was looking for."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I wanted something fresh and natural and ended up here. Someone said that service takes a while, which is true but what else can you expect when someone is making juice/smoothie from scratch with natural fruit? The salad I had was delicious and the juice was amazing as well. I can't wait to go back and try all the flavors of juices and smoothies, YUM!!"}
