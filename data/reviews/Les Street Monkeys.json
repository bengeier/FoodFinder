{"text":"I was really hyped about that place when I first heard about it. Went on a sunday evening with friends to give it a try: place is well decorated, nice vibe. In my opinion they have too many employees doing nothing except standing there talking to each other, checking their phone and even giving each other shoulder massages (sigh)

    The food: if you're really hungry or eat a lot expect to spend at least 40-50$ a person because the portions are incredibly small. We had eggrolls, papaya salad, beef and chicken skewers and fish amok.
 I notice that we had only 3 eggrolls instead of 4 i don't know why, ( i saw pictures of people having 4) but thats not my case. They were good for 2$ each egg rolls, nothing famous. 
Skewers 9$ for the plate, so 3$ each skewers; they taste good a bit dry overdone on the beef ones, the chicken tasted better, but still nothing famous. Papaya salad was a nice portion and tasty well balanced, they let you decide how spicy you want it. 
Fish amok was by far the best meal to me. Coconut creamy flavours, thin fried taro chips, it was a nice portion. I could eat 3 of those if they weren't 14$ the plate.

Overall: Disappointed, I don't think I'm going back if they stay the same. I feel like most people who went for the first time share the same opinion or else the place would be more crowded. 
It's also the kind of place where they act very friendly and all only with people they know  ( i saw free drinks given at the table next to us). 

This place is still promising but if they don't change a thing about their menu and the way they treat every customers,they won't come back unless they're friends. 
The concept of the restaurant is very original and could be the top place of Montreal everynight, but there's something wrong with the way they handle the restaurant business. Time will tell in a year or two if they still on the map.

{"text":"It is absolutely fabulous in all respects- great food and drinks, fun decor, wonderful service and a super vibe all around. I have travelled throughout Asia, including Cambodia. I love everything on the menu at Street Monkeys  especially, the shrimp ceviche and the trout with tomato salsa. They also serve the best fried banana desert I have ever eaten. At most places the dough is thick but here it is light, barely there. The bonus is that they are close to the Lasalle Metro station so no need for a car."}
{"text":"C'est bon mais les portions sont tellement petites même pour des tapas considérant le prix. Tout arrivait en 3 portions donc en étant deux on partageait le petit dernier morceau. Ça donne l'impression qu'on a mangé deux portions mais non.  Ça semble être la nouvelle formule des restaurants: les tapas en petit nombre impair. 

Les cocktails sont excellents et sont exotiques. Tout était excellent à part le prix par rapport à la portion servie."}
{"text":"Et bien j'étais super excitée d'essayer ce nouveau spot dans Verdun. Malheureusement pas de places sans réservation. Donc ça deja ce sont des points en moins. Je me suis dit que j'allais commander à emporte. Non mais quelle déception! La taille des plats à emporter est juste microscule!!! C'est bon cela dit mais j'aime manger à ma faim et là, je crois que c'était plutôt des dégustations style tapas. Alors, le prix aussi, et oui alors la pas cool du tout! C'était assez dispandieux. Je suis un peu têtue alors j'y retournerai pour une expérience en salle mais globalement pour le moment je ne donnerai pas plus de 3 étoiles."}
{"text":"Great food, great vibe. 
Love the wasabi shrimp ceviche. 
Beef Laab is great too. 
You must get the fried papaya salad."}
{"text":"It's a disappointment when stars come off when Restaurants  can't accommodate clients during \"busy hours\". We came here around 6:30 pm, group of 5. Our waiter was great but the \"your drinks are coming\" got old quickly. I had to cancel my second drink because there was only one bartender for a full house. On top of that, we had to order from another server because we couldn't flag down the waiter.Although, service was made up by offering a dessert on the house (I am glad they did). 

However, it's pretty simple supply= demand. Get another bartender!"}
{"text":"Very nice, unique place, great cocktails, staff is very cool and good, fun time here. Food is amazing."}
{"text":"A hot spot to celebrate a special friend's birthday! Small but very cool restaurant. Not much of decoration but few neon lights makes this place funky.

Middle of the week; it was busy and happening here, but sadly there was one waitress taking everyone's orders. Therefore, the service was bit long. Since we had a fantastic group to enjoy this event; we didn't feel that much the long wait.

In nutshell, 12 people ordered their own dishes and every single person enjoyed each dish very much. I had a cocktail after very long time; I took litchi Gentleman; my drink showed up on fire. It was a party... we all got excited just watching my drink's fire to go down slowly. It was wonderful drink, not too sweet and not too strong. Perfect... just for me!
I had the fried papaya salad, slightly spicy, and it was my favorite dish! It was so good, I could have ordered more. Then I had grilled calamari and mee siam (fried vermicelli with vegetables). Both were absolutely delicious. Then for desert I had fried banana; it was a bit different than what I ever had. It was softer texture and the whip cream was more creamier. 

It was a wonderful restaurant: everything was delight. Definitely, we will be going back."}
{"text":"Now this is something new for verdun !!

There is so many things to try:

Trout pan-fried in clarified butter, shrimp ceviche, mee siam (a thin rice vermicelli dish) in a spiced soybean and crabmeat sauce, grilled eggplant and papaya salads, and 'mom's imperial rolls' -- a mix of ground pork, onion, taro, salt, sugar and Cambodian kampot pepper.

The inside has amazing elements of alleyways, from its mural that runs the length of the restaurant to the strings of neon and exposed filament bulb lighting above the bar."}
{"text":"Food is good, environment is good. However, it is a little overpriced. Also, I kinda feel like it is a copy of satay brother... My opinion is that satay brother is better overall for their food, much more variety compared to street monkeys.

I've been there twice, and honestly don't think I'll be back for a third time. The first time, they forgot one of our order. Second time, we ordered one beer, and they charged us 2 instead."}
{"text":"Went there recently amongst friends and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience including the decor, menu, service(A1 for explanations & suggestions) and the friends experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a few weeks and finally, on our third attempt at a reservation we got a table at 7PM on a Wednesday. 
I have to say... this place is wonderful! The staff is very inviting and answer any questions you have about the food, even giving us a chance to talk to the chef. He even let us know the methods to some of the recipes! 
I had two drinks, the Mary Khmao and the Je Kampote. The first was a very strong and came with a piece of calamari as a garnish, which was really cool. It was a little strong for me so I let my boyfriend have it and ordered the Je Kampote which was very refreshing and different... would order again. I found the drinks a little expensive but delicious nonetheless. 
The food was phenomenal. My favourites were the fried papaya salad, a special of the day and the wasabi shrimp ceviche. If you can't handle spice, don't order it! The spring rolls and eggplant salad were amazing, as well as the red curry fish. The only one we weren't fond of was the beef dish with fermented fish sauce.
The service was amazing and very accommodating. Thumbs up for our waitress, we didn't get her name but she made the experience that much better. 
Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a long time. The flavours in the food were something I've never had. Their poor stew was incredible, stuffed chicken wings, fried vermexelli salad was beyond belief. Everything we we had was amazing if you like Thai and Vietnamese this place is for you. Not to mention the staff were super friendly and really seemed like they wanted to make sure you enjoyed your time. I could swear they each owned a stake since they clearly cared so much. Cool ambiance and great music and the food came out fast and hot. Make a reso since they were packed even on a -30 night."}
{"text":"I love everything at this Montreal-Canadian Cambodian Thai restaurant! The location is off the grid in an up-and-coming neighbourhood. The decor is set with a trendy vibe. There is a long bar and several tables for dining. Make reservations if you can it does get pretty busy. We started off with some cocktails and ordered everything from the menu appetisers and entrees. The portions are quite small so be sure to order enough for your group. And definitely ask for the side of sticky rice. If you are feeling adventurous and want something spicy in your life give street monkey a try!"}
{"text":"Needing a change from French Canadian food during our trip we decided to have our final dinner at Les Street Monkeys. It was a bit uneven but overall enjoyable. The papaya salad was spicy but not very flavorful. Both the chicken and beef skewers were very good. The grilled squid was bland but came with a delicious sauce. My friends loved the lamb dishes. I loved the amok, the sauce was especially good. The stuffed chicken wings were fun but a bit dry. I didn't care for the sliced beef, done tataki style. 

The place is chill and the staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Takes reservations: No
Good for groups: Yes


We showed up on a Saturday night and told straight up \"No\" when we asked for a table of four. We even asked if we could wait and still told no because a group of 30 was coming. Unfortunately we left even though there was clearly room at the bar. Whoever was at the front of the restaurant on July 22nd at 8:45pm does not know how to handle receiving customers, she asked us if we wanted to make a reservation on another day, we declined."}
{"text":"I had high expectations going in, and was not disappointed! Great cocktails, fast service and the food was amazing! Notably the cod with red curry, lemongrass chicken skewers and fried papaya salad! We sat in front of the kitchen, and given what we saw, I would try everything on the menu! Reasonable prices and good music as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to get a group tasting menu and sample almost evrything on the menu, which was fabulous from start to finish. Lots of spicy dishes, interesting combinations, and unique offerings. Cocktails were also good, though i would avoid the strangely smoky tasting margarita in the future. Definitely a place to go back to again and again. Excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner. It's a tapas style restaurant so the menu is fairly limited. The restaurant isn't too big, dim lights with some neon lighted decor and very loud music. It's an open concept so you can watch your food being cooked at the bar. 

The food was absolutely delicious!! Very few restaurants know how to season a fish well and here it was amazing!! I had the fish over salsa. I also ordered the fried papaya salad which was just as good! Honestly we were all salivating. I asked for spicy and my mouth was on fire! I also ordered their ginger mocktail, really good! However I wouldn't order it with a spicy meal lol As for dessert I had sesame doughnut which I didn't like as much. My friends had a banana dessert which I preferred. 

I found the music too loud which made it hard to converse with the people around the table. The restaurant was packed and it seemed like there was only 1 waitress taking the orders. 

I have some food allergies which I informed them of. What I really appreciated is they took that into serious consideration. I was the last person to receive my salad. When asked the waitress why, she said the cooks wanted to make the other salads first, clean the dishes and then make mines. 

I would definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is a club meets a cocktail bar meets a tappa restaurant. I can see it going from a place to have an intimate relaxed dinner to a bustling energetic bar depending on the clientele of the night. We were here on a Friday late night for dinner and found it mostly empty. There were several tables quietly enjoying their dinner and drinks, so we grabbed a table and did so also.

The food are in tasting portions, meant to be shared at the table. Everyone gets maybe a bite-or-two and the dish will be gone. For example, the sausage stuffed chicken wings ($10) comes with only three wings and some pickled veggies on the side. But they are well seasoned, perfectly cooked and shows a lot of thought and preparation. The rest of the dishes are in the same vein. Small dishes, pricey for the portion, but well executed. I think we ordered around 7-8 dishes for 4 people and we were not hungry but definitely not feeling full by the end of the night. 

Extra star for making a great unique cocktail that packs a punch! Check the drinks menu for specials."}
{"text":"This spot has been in my radar for a while seeing that I always enjoy tapas style restaurants that offer  you the chance to sample many dishes. I organized a Meetup dinner for a group of 12 where we'd get a fixed menu at a fixed price and chef's choice on the items. From the moment I called in for the reservation, the staff was exceptionally accommodating and polite, ensuring me this would be a great experience, and it indeed it was! 

We were served an abundance of food, 11 total, to share amongst our group and not one dish wasn't a complete pleasure! We sampled the ceviche, eggplant salad, papaya salad, imperial rolls, marinated beef, chicken skewers, mushroom dip, Thai sausage, curried fish, fried vermicelli, and lamb chop; everything was plain outstanding! All the dishes were well prepared and nicely seasoned; heavy on lemongrass, fish sauce, chilli and basil, representative of Cambodian street food as our waitress who happened to be Cambodian assured us, the dishes were just plain delicious! 

I also got to taste some of their cocktails, including the Pimm's Juice and Tota Margarita. The Pimm's cocktail was light and palatable. The margarita, with crushed grasshopper and red worm, was interesting but I found it too smoky for my taste. 

The service, from start to finish, was great; our dishes, served over three servings, came out of the kitchen at the same time and the staff took time to explain our dishes, much to the delight of the group. 

The venue, with its graffiti wall, light wood tables and black chairs, including the long bar with ample seating and open kitchen, was slick, modern with an industrial vibe. Although we've heard the venue can get loud, we were all able to carry a conversation even though seated under a speaker, and the place was full on a Friday night. 

I highly recommend this spot for its amazing and tasty food, great service and awesome vibe. Definitely going back asap!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere! Very flavourful dishes, watch out for the shrimp ceviche it's got that really intense wasabi kick. We also ordered the stuffed chicken wings, Mee Siam vermicelli salad, Beef Laab. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"As a Verdunois born and raised, it is such a pleasure to see a restaurant such as Les Street Monkeys open on Wellington. The perfect place to go and to share dishes and discover Cambodian cuisine. 

It should be noted that the restaurant does accept reservations and in fact recommends them, as it gets quite busy.

DECOR:
The restaurant replaces an graffiti-ridden empty space on the edge of the commercial part of Wellington with a mix of urban street elements, industrial decor and clean elements. A long wooden bar runs along the somewhat narrow space from the entrance through the bar to the open kitchen. A pipe and lightbulb chandelier and light strips integrated to the ceiling and a decently sized front window give the space a good amount of light, and  illuminate the mural that runs along the wall across from the bar. The atmosphere is lively as there are no empty seats in this restaurant; the music is at a reasonable level. 

SERVICE:
The service at the restaurant was excellent, with a small hang up in service (which is to be expected in any new restaurant) was quickly corrected. The dishes we ordered were brought out at a good pace. 

DRINKS:
We ordered 2 drinks, their twist on a Moscow Mule called \"Je Kampote\", and \"Le Vieux Verdun\", a cognac cocktail based on an Old Fashioned. Both were well-made, delicious and of generous size. Though their signature cocktails are probably what most people will go for, they have a decent wine and beer offering, as well as a fully-stocked bar.

FOOD:
On recommendation of our waitress, we got 5 dishes to share for 2 people: the papaya salad, the pan-seared trout with tomato salsa, the wasabi shrimp ceviche, sachko tuk prahok (rare beef slices in a fermented fish sauce) and grilled squid. All the dishes were excellent, well-balanced, with the strong flavours of fish sauce, lime, garlic and lemongrass perfectly balanced. The stand-out dish was by far the pan-seated trout, which was one of the most flavourful pieces of fish I've ever had. For dessert, we shared the dessert of the day (only dessert option), warm sticky rice in a coconut lemongrass sauce, with toasted coconut flakes and mango. 

OVERALL: at 95$ +tip for 2 people with 2 drinks and dessert, this restaurant is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Amazing new spot in a neighbourhood that definitely needs it. Nice decor, friendly staff and very efficient service.

Cool small plate menu, so you can taste a bit of everything (trust me you'll want to). The food is incredible, the flavours are intricate and just so delicious. We tried 4 dishes, none of them disappointed and it was the perfect amount of food for 2 people. Ceviche and amok were particularly phenomenal. Cocktails are also very tasty.

Nothing bad to say, I'll most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with my aunt Sunday night. We shared a few plates and sat at the bar.

The portions are small and it's pricy for what you get. Some plates were a hit and others were a miss.

We had the fried imperial rolls with pork and taro which were good. My favourite dish was the beef skewers. I also enjoyed the chicken wings stuffed with Thai sausages. We also had the fish amok. It was thin slices of battered cod in a red Thai curry sauce. It was tasty but very small. I wish the plate had been bigger. My least favorite dish was the papaya salad. Usually we like to eat papaya salad but this one had way too much fish sauce and tasted as if there were pieces of dried fish in it. We both couldn't eat it. It was such a waste. 

The drinks were interesting. I started with the Je Compote. It is made up of gin, sake, ginger, lime and Thai basil. The ginger was very overpowering  but I didn't mind it. If you don't like ginger don't order it. I also had the Mary Khmao which is their version of a Bloody Caesar . It contains Belvedere vodka, fish sauce, homemade squid ink, Worcestershire, hot sauce, tomato juice and Clamato and rimmed with steal spice. 

I think this place has potential if they make their portions bigger and if they fix their papaya salad to make it less fishy. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Premièrement, c'est un des meilleurs resto à verdun, j'ai habiter pendant 6 ans. L'ambiance est très festif, ce que j'adore. Je ne me rappelle pu qu'est que souper mais c'était excellent. 9/10"}
{"text":"I want to say this place is awful so it doesn't get to popular but it is the total opposite..... great tasting food and maybe some of the best service around these days!
Starting with the food, must try the trout and the shrimp.... excellent! The service is way beyond good, everybody, even if they aren't your server ,waits on you including the chef/ owner.
The atmosphere is new, young, can be a little loud but worth it ,as the food is excellent and very reasonably priced . Put this together with servers who are proud of their restaurant and happy when a customer is happy ( a rarity these days in the Montreal resto scene of pretentious chefs) this is a must try place and has become our favourite."}
{"text":"Small restaurant in Verdun, staff is really nice, the menu is a bit small but the prices are right.
Tried the Second Base and Berry Goood (Cocktails). Both were very good and the second base had a nice presentation.
The papaya salad was flavorful, but next time I will order it extra spicy. The chicken drums were good, a bit sweet, but I would have preferred them to be a bit more crunchy. The mee siam was underwhelming. A bit too sweet and I didn't like the texture. The wasabi shrimps were really good, even though the wasabi really hits you. 
We also had the sticky rice with mango, I believe it is a must!
When you go, don't forget to look at their daily specials!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! My belly is thanking you. Loved everything from the fried papaya salad to the lamb shop! Will come back again soon :)"}
{"text":"Came here while visiting Verdun. LOVED it! The vibe was chill and fun and the food was so delicious. 
We ordered about 5 things to share, but of course cannot remember anything... but I remember the shrimp dish was very yummy and the cocktails were awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow. Now, this was a treat.

Arriving at Les Street Monkeys on a quiet-ish Sunday evening in Verdun, I was pleased to find a tastefully-designed and sizeable space and a decent amount of people dining, but not so many that we needed a reservation. Throughout the course of the evening, we sampled the majority of the menu and were thoroughly impressed with presentation, taste, and in general, the uniqueness of the plates.

The only dishes that were lost on me were the papaya salad (I'll be honest and say I'm thoroughly spoiled by living so close to Satay Bros and their famous papaya salad) and the fried chicken. While the fried chicken was still pretty delicious, the seasoning was a little too much of a punch to the face for my sensitive white girl sensibilities. Other folks at the table were pretty jazzed with it, however.

Above all, I have to say the service was absolutely top-notch. Our server was attentive, gregarious and seemingly an all-around good guy. He made for the kind of dining experience where I felt bad he wasn't sitting down for dinner with us."}
