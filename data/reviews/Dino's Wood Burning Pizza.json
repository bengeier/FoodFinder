{"text":"Dino is a great guy and his pizza is fantastic. Check it out!"}
{"text":"First time and probably...definitely last! Ordered delivery and had high expectations! Lacked flavour, sauce and ingredients! Next time I'll aim for lower expectations when ordering my next pie!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a traditional Italian family style pizza place then Dino's is for you. Best pizza that I've had in the west end.

There are at least 30-40 different types of pizza orders. The extra large for less than $30 (taxes in), is enough for 4 people and they let you do half and half, The taste is fantastic! The crust is thin and the ingredients high quality.

The place is a bit small, and a bit dated, but that only adds to the charm. Some famous people have dined here and their signed pictures are on the walls. 

Dino the owner is very customer oriented."}
{"text":"Nice pizza. Only complaints are place is too small. Prices are too high as well. Almost 30$ for large with tips n taxes"}
{"text":"We tried it on the level of the reviews and were not disappointed. ..the pizza was excellent. We had the meat lovers and my daughter had the calzone. The service was great and the food ...super quick to the table.  Small but wonderful and i will return next time i am in the city."}
{"text":"We always order for delivery and the pizza is amazing, so I can only imagine having it fresh out of the oven.  Love the pides too, first place I've ever had them and man are they good."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza in the city. The crust is perfect. The cheese is perfect. The sauce is perfect. And the service is friendly and attentive. Even the washrooms are worth complimenting - spotless. Worth a trip no matter what part of town is home."}
{"text":"If you like wood burning oven pizza (who doesn't), and quality ingredients, this is a great spot.  We dined in and, while not the most upscale place, the pizza is very very good.  I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I went to Dino's expecting a great pizza based on reviews. What I got was a large pizza that tasted like burnt dough. I guess the woman that made it was not sure how to handle a wood fire oven. These ovens are not made for rookies so I'm assuming that was the reason I ended up with what I got. Also don't get the wings they were small in size and just not very good."}
{"text":"The pizza is AMAZING! I had a vegitarian pizza the other day and it was geat quality and service is great. They deliver too. I would much rather this than pizza pizza any day."}
{"text":"A must try. Caesar salad is fabulous and the pizza is Italian authentic. Everything tasted fresh. If I lived in the area Dino's would be our go to pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto.
As a 81 year old world traveller I came by  Dino's  Wood Burning Pizza on the Queensway.
Dino has 29 Traditional & Gourmet Pizza to enjoy, which are made with the freshest, highest quality ingredients, home made dough & sauces, with no preservatives.
A great pizzas with a Italian passion every time."}
{"text":"I always passed by this joint every time I do a Costco run at The Queensway.  Decided to check it out as I was in the mood for some pizza.

Walked in, and immediately saw the beautiful wood oven.

I ordered a medium half & half of Hawaiana and Canadese to share with my wife. Service was fantastic, and pizza came out quickly.

This has got to be the best pizza I have ever had. The crust was super thin, and full of the wood burning fragrant. Toppings are so tasty, and fresh. They served it with garlic infused olive oil, and fresh basil.  We devoured the pizza in minutes.

Even Milla Jovovich visited this pizza joint when she was in town!  You've got to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Far and away the best pizza in Toronto. Pides are phenomenal. The crust is perfect, and the toppings fresh and delicious. 

Salads are super tasty. 

I recommend the sujuk pide. 

Well worth the extra cost"}
{"text":"Mixed review. We ordered two medium pizzas for delivery. The arugula/prosciutto pizza and the quattro stagioni. First off, their crust is a 4.5 - some of the best pizza crust in the city, even the burnt bits.

Unfortunately, the stagioni had so many anchovies on it that it was a salty fish pizza. Most of it went in the garbage. The arugula/prosciutto pizza was tasty. However, even though the website showed that you could get basil for free, we didn't ask for it but both pizzas were covered in it. Usually not a bad thing but by the time the pizzas arrived the basil was a brown sweaty mess. 

I'm happy to pay a high price for a great pizza but $47 (including tip) for two mediums, one of which ended up in the garbage, is poor value."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto.

First, pizza is subjective. And due to the proliferation of, subjectively, garbage like Pizza Pizza and Dominos, people subject themselves to a lot of cardboard and cheese-like goo.

Dino's is the opposite of that. The thin crust pizzas are wood-fired and have all the delicious, crispy black bits that comes with it. While the crusts are thin, they're still chewy and not at all crumbly. The toppings are generous, with lots of real cheese. 

The menu is interesting and you can have lots of flavors. Even a traditional pizza like a new york pepperoni is full of flavor. But I'd recommend the quatro stagioni for a delicious flavor blast.

Seriously, eat here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Really good za

Just doesn't fill me up. 

I've called here for delivery dozens of times and I guess they are so busy they can't even pick up the phone"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say, but our last few experiences with Dino's have been disappointing. 
We have been ordering from him usually once per week for a few years now.

Every week, we painstakingly have to spell out our street name, describe that it's a house, etc.    They make good pizza, and they're busy, but that means that there's tons of background noise, sometimes we get put on hold multiple times while they answer other calls, etc.  It would be great if they had a slightly better/more efficient system for ordering...  Or at least a list of regulars' addresses?

Anyway, our 2nd most recent order was completely mixed up.  We ordered half just cheese and half just pepperoni (a very common order for us now that we have a toddler eating with us).   And they ALWAYS get it right, except this most recent time... the entire thing had pepperoni, and 1/2 had the addition of mushrooms!?   Weird mix-up.

Then, the most recent time I ordered was a Wednesday at 5:40 pm.  I usually find the weekdays you can get a pizza within 40 minutes (Fridays are definitely an exception, you'll have to wait over an hour if you order near 6 pm).  Anyway, on this particular Wednesday, I started to question where the pizza was around 6:25 pm, 6:30.... I like to have my toddler eating by 6:30 pm as she's usually getting ready for bed shortly after 7 pm.  Finally at about 6:40 pm (ONE HOUR later) I called, and Dino said oh yeah, I'll put yours in the oven now...  It's only 5 minutes after I put it in.

I was beside myself.... in a full hour, a plain cheese pizza had not yet made it in the oven????   Sure enough, it arrived within about 20 minutes of that phone call, but my toddler was way over tired and well past wanting pizza by that time.   I was completely disappointed and amazed that such a regular customer would be treated that way.  

At $40+ for just a pizza and a salad, I expect a bit more from them.

They make GREAT pizza, and I love that it's not a chain, it's local, and it's wood-fired.   But please Dino, don't let it slip!!"}
{"text":"Terrible and a total rip off pizza was awful and I am Italian.
Do yourself a favour and never order from here. FBI pizza much better"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pie for take out and the food was excellent.  Thin crust and was nicely covered with Cheese and a tasty sauce.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I was walking down the queensway, on my way to Burger King tonight.  Line up was out the door with a bunch of drunk high school kids. Walked out frustrated and hungry.  Saw Dino's pizza adjacent from me. Walked in. Grabbed a menu. And decided to roll the dice and place a order. Ordered a large gourmet veggie supreme. Amazing pricing at. $22 all in. Sat down in the restaurant. And in 15 minutes I was out the door.  Got home. Sat down,  opened the pizza box. And the fresh steam arouma warmed my kitchen as me and 2 others observed this masterpiece. Looked amazing. Smelt amazing. Me and 2 others attacked this pizza like seagulls at Ontario place. The crust had a campfire taste. Amazing.... The toppings weren't manufactured at a warehouse miles away. They were picture perfect . Amazing.... Cheese and sauce tasted homemade !! The overall package..  I am so satisfied. Even ended up scraping the lost toppings out of the box. Highly recommend Dino's pizza to satisfy your hunger. I will definitely be returning. Thank you Dino's for this amazing experience."}
{"text":"This is a really nice thin crust pizza place. The pizza gets a slight char due to the brick oven which makes it crispy."}
{"text":"Really good za!

My family is new to the area and were meaning to try Dino's since we moved in. It's walking distance from our house and read some great reviews.  Pizza is our favourite food, so we were excited to try the place out. 

Ordered a large half pepperoni, mushroom, bacon and half pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper. 

The crust was thin and crispy, the sauce was nice and they give you basil for free!!!

Large was recommended but was barely enough, next time we will get an XL. 

Word of warning - with the wife on a hot August evening and they do not have air conditioning. If you can bring it home to eat, I'd probably do that

Support your local businesses! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Quality thin crust pizza heavy in flavour, if a bit undercooked. It's a diner atmosphere with restaurant prices. Had the Americano pie"}
{"text":"Oven cooked, best pizzas!! The place is small and the service, what you'd expect from a tiny local eatery (not in a positive way) but the food, great!! You also have the option of fresh basil on top."}
{"text":"Modest interior but the pizza is incredible. They are also very accommodating and modified my pizza as I'm vegetarian to a Hawaiian sub mushrooms a seed onions. The pizza was one of the best I've had here in Toronto."}
{"text":"Well, best pizza in Toronto is a massive stretch.  Got a \"deal\" on delivery which included a medium pizza, some wings, garlic bread with cheese 2 pops.  Now I guess the pizza was okay though it was not really hot, like Luke warm at best, it was a fairly thin crust which is nice if it is not as soggy, wierd that it was soggy as the edge was chared to a beautiful black.  Hot Italian sausage should Taste like something.  I would say it was a VERY small medium.  The wings were tasty, the garlic flat bread as well, the highlight of the meal though was the Canada dry ginger ale!  Mmm fifty dollar ginger ale, that's how much the combo \"deal\" was, for fifty dollars, well I expect more from pizza, even if it is the best pizza in Toronto."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think you would be able to find any really good eats out of the vast array of run down shops and restaurants that line the Queensway.  But amongst all that here lies Dino's pizza, a little pizza shop that you could (and probably have) passed by without thinking twice about eating there.

You wouldn't ever think the most deliciously crispy, thin crusted, genuinely wood-fired, and rustic pizzas are churned out here, topped with the freshest of ingredients, oils and spices. 

Dino's seem to have their pizzas down to an art, the orders keep coming in and Dino is there with his colleague making pizza after pizza, for delivery, pickup and a handful of patrons grabbing a bite inside the restaurant.  It's a no-frills type of place that you'd expect to serve up sub-par food but they don't.  Fire wood is piled under the large round oven waiting their turn to enter the oven fire.  There's something really rustic and flavourful about using a wood-fired oven that gives the pizza a unique flavour.

I tried the Pizza Italiano, Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Spicy Italian Sausage, Mushrooms & Red Peppers; we opted for artichoke hearts instead of red peppers.  It was a fantanstic pizza, one you would expect to find at a nice sit-down itallian restaurant like Terroni, Cibo or Buca.  The pepperoni and Italian sausage were flavourful, yet not over processed or fatty tasting, the crust ever so thin yet crispy, covered in the perfect amount of fresh cheese.  The herbs they sprinkle on top add the last aromatic finishing touch.

I would highly recommend a trip to Dino's if you're in the area (and even if you're not!) it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Dino's the man!  Still working and still passionate about making delicious pizzas and pides. It was difficult to drive my Margherita pizza home to the wife in one piece.  The smell of wood oven baked dough and fresh basil (always FREE!) was intoxicating. We probably waited a little too long before we ate it, but it was still a great dinner. Ordered one large ($18 + HST) and we had leftovers. Will definitely be back to sample more."}
{"text":"If you've ever driven along the Queensway, you'll know that there is no shortage of pizza joints, in fact, I would say there is a surplus. To be frank the last time I saw this many consecutive pizza places was in Montreal, on St. Catherine and those were separated only by strip clubs. 

Dino's is a run by a Turkish guy and he would appear to be pretty famous given the amount of newspaper clippings he has framed of himself around the shop. 

I would say that if I had to pick a reason for visiting this place above all others it would be a) he was one of the only ones who have a traditional stone oven, and b) I got his flyer in the mail a dozen times. 

Overall, the pizza was OK - good quality toppings, good dough/crust and a decent sauce. All the basics done right - hence the 4 stars, but the centre of the pizza was very oily and was falling apart. Perhaps it had to do with the combination of toppings we went for... but taste was 120% awesome. 

Would I go back? Sure the price was right. BUT there are many pizza places on Queensway and Daddy needs to spread his love around before he comes back! 

Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"This is a great find as it gives one an option instead of being stuck in traffic from the dreaded drive back from Costco. I am a fan  of Pide and enjoy it whenever I can. I went for the sujuck pide and DC ordered the spinach and cheese version. This was a scorcher of a day and sadly no AC in this place. We decided to sit out (not a good idea for the first 15-20 min as the sun was hitting us straight) They have a decent selection of soft drinks which helped cool down. This is fresh baked pizza so took its time. First the dough is decent and sujuck thankfully is not the mild version which most other people have started to use. Nice chewy crust so two for two there.
Priced reasonably I would pick it over mediocre pizza offerings nearby any day. They also had kebabs etc. so there is something else on offer for the non pizza luvers as well."}
{"text":"5 star pizza, seriously good!

Really generous salads albeit not as gourmet as the pizza.

Down to earth environment, felt like Italy again!"}
{"text":"Pizza is some the best you can get. Although they will deliver, try to eat in.  The ambiance is dull and pretty basic but the pizza is worth it.  The sauce and toppings are fresh and comes with a splash of olive oil. Very Neapolitan.
Where it really stands out is the crust and why you should eat in.  The steam from a hot pizza in the box makes the crust soggy. If you eat in it comes out hot and toasty from the wood fired oven. It is a great thin crust and has lots of flavor. Convenient if you order out, know you lose a lot by doing so.  Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great pizza...  Shame you have to buy a whole pizza...  Not many options if you want to pop in for lunch."}
{"text":"I have been living about 10 mins away from this place for the last 3 years and not once did I stumble upon it. When I found it on yelp, needless to say I was very excited to go.

My girlfriend and I ordered an extra large pizza Americana (#4 on the menu - tomato sauce, cheese, mushrooms, pepperoni, and sausage). The waitress that took our order was very courteous and welcoming. We waited no longer than 5-10 mins, and upon paying, our order was ready for the drive home. 

Menu - the menu is fairly simple; pizzas and pidas making up most of it. Enough food choices to keep you coming back and trying different pizzas, but not too many to confuse you when trying to order.

Price - valuing a real wood-oven pizza, it's not hard to justify paying a bit of a premium over your regular Pizza Pizza pizza. At approximately $25 + tax and enough for two people that can eat like champs, our extra large pizza was adequately priced. 

Ambiance - our short wait at the pizzeria gave us a chance to sit down at a table and observe. This is definitely not a place for a romantic dinner, but it a class above your regular pizzeria chain.

Food - the pizza was very good. I felt like the sauce was a bit lacking and the dough should've been crispier. The ingredients are fresh and sparingly topped, with just enough toppings to perfectly balance out all the flavours. 

This is a place that I would recommend to any pizza lover. 9/10 overall score."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza joint - staff is friendly and laid back. I was super surprised to see them actual throwing wood into their stove right in the open (you never see that!!). It was pretty cool.

Pizza was great - comparable to Milano's pizza. One of the only 2 pizza joints I'll actually go to in Etobicoke. Bought this pizza for my parents and they couldn't stop raving about it."}
{"text":"I have had this pizza several times and sometimes I love it and sometimes I don't - when the ingredients are fresh and there is a lot of cheese, it's delicious but I have also had it where the crust was stale and pepperoni tasted off.  I would have it again but I don't always love it."}
{"text":"5/5. I am Italian and this is by far the best pizza in the city! Always fresh, quality ingredients, and authentic. Dino is always warm and kind to us. 

I only support local businesses and have stopped eating out at bs chain places that are just garbage, and rip you off on quality."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Saturday after reading so many great reviews. The place itself is very small. Can probably seat max 15 people at one time with some outdoor seating (like 3 tables). As we walked in the server/cashier was very helpful when asking questions on what to get. We opted in for the special number 1 which was a medium 3 topping pizza, one pound of wings, garlic bread, ceaser salad and 2 pops for 38.99. I thought that price was very fair for what you get.

We decided to eat in and enjoy the neighbourhood a little. In the summer time it does get very hot because you have the wood burning oven on and no ac.. the wait time for the meal was expected.. but they start serving you course after course. We started with the ceaser salad. It was huge. Came with bacon and fresh toasted bread (sub as croutons) then the garlic bread came and that was cheesy and delicious. Next our oven baked wings... 1 pound may not seem like much at a regular wing place for some people but this place gives you a good smokey charcoal flavour with lots of wings! We ordered the honey garlic as the server had suggested and my fiance (who only has spicy wings) thought it was amazing! Our pizza came last and it came with fresh basil on top. We ordered the Italiano which came with pepperoni, Italian sausage, red peppers and cheese. The pizza was thin and tasty with the cheese being perfect!!! It's not the type of cheese you would get at like pizza pizza, instead it's cheese that when you pull the apart the string of the cheese can go for miles. It was amazing.

Will definitely come back and maybe even make this a regular pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Called this place for a delivery. I recently moved into the neighbourhood and would always walk past this place with my dog. I stepped in last time and asked for a slice. They told me they don't sell slices just pizzas. So now after I've ordered... I ordered a deluxe  gourmet pizza with garlic bread and cheese. The pizza isn't bad. I think it's overpriced for the quality. I didn't feel this was very gourmet either. The garlic bread barely had any garlic. Overall i give it a 2.5 stars. They can improve. But next time I'll just walk one block to pizza Nova. At least the delivery was fast but it wasn't more then a 2km drive anyway"}
{"text":"Amazing hospitality and delicious pide. Feel and taste the freshness of the ingredients on a thin and crunchy crust. Will definitely try some of their pizzas soon."}
{"text":"Tried pepperoni pide nice taste garlic different.
Wings were not as good as in past little bit greasy even with wood burning oven
I ordered before 5 pm so delivery prompt, sometimes slow when busy
I would like to dine 8 next time"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! We ordered the #2 special to go. Came with pizza, wings, Caesar salad, garlic bread, and pop. My husband said the chicken wing meat just fell off the bone, very tender. Pizza was great and I always say if you can eat the pizza cold the next day and it still tastes good, it's good pizza!"}
{"text":"So far, this is the best tasting pizza in the area and maybe most of downtown Toronto. The pizza is classic thin crust, and while the dough is fine, it can be a little soggy most times. Stand out feature of this pizza is the mozzarella cheese used. You can taste the quality cheese here and they don't skimp on the amount. Recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza place. Every time I come here I am not let down by how delicious the pizza is, and all the staff is super nice."}
{"text":"what you see is what you get with this place.  it is consistent--consistently mediocre.  the highlights:

pros:
*they have calzones
*wood burning oven
*they deliver

cons:
*pizzas are overpriced
*plain cheese pizza is same price as a 3 topping pizza
*calzones don't come with enough sauce (2 oz.)
*fee for paying with credit card
*fee for delivery"}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant! The best pizza and the best friendly service. 

We ordered their Hawaiian pizza and Cesar salad (the croutons are amazing) every time we go. Our picky toddler has no problems filling his belly at Dino's. 

Pricing is very reasonable too. 

Thanks Dino's! We always look forward to going."}
{"text":"One of the the better if not the best  pizza I've had in Toronto. They hook you up with tons of toppings and great taste.

I always prefer thing crust because you can really taste the toppings. We had an extra large which was huge and really filling. We went for lunch during the week and the place was really quiet. Service was great also"}
{"text":"Old school staff, pick up made quickly, friendly. 
A little pricey, but not too high I wouldn't return again."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza , had the margherita pizza was yummy and flavourful! Service was good and the patio was nice with the patio umbrellas shading us from the sun"}
{"text":"Service is always great! Food is always great! The pizza is cooked in the wood brining dome oven so it's authentic and delicious. Sometimes the garlic bread gets toasted too much though... Salads are a good portion. Wings are ok, you can probably make them at home. The only thing is that there isn't too much space in the restaurant so we usually get take out! Parking is also hard to get (just a few spots right in front, which are usually occupied, try the side streets).

Don't forget to ask for the fresh basil!
Price value is reasonable."}
{"text":"Great little neighbourhood gem. Stopped by after reading reviews and had Greek salad and pizza. The salad was delicious and  unique when it comes to Greek salad. Apparently they use pomegranate juice in their dressing. Thin crust pizza was fresh and tasty. Servings were generous. Could easily have fed another couple of people."}
{"text":"Stopped by Dino's 30 minutes before closing on Canada Day. I called earlier to make sure they were opened, but was a little worried about getting my order in.

Thankfully, the staff (including the owner) were extremely friendly and welcomed us to dine-in. Ordered, I believe, the \"Italiano\" pizza and some chicken wings and I was a really big fan of both. 

Pizza is beautiful in all its forms, however, thin crust pizza is my absolute favourite. With this said, the pizza at Dino's was definitely to my liking - thin and light, but not lacking in the flavour department. Best of all, it was topped with fresh basil (none of the pre chopped, dry, supermarket kind). The chicken wings were also great - smoky in flavour and perfectly sauced.

Looking forward to going back and trying their other offerings!"}
{"text":"Crispy thin crusts. Less salty than some. Interesting ingredients . You can taste the anise in the Italian sausage. Friendly staff. Open wood burning oven is wonderful on cold winter nights. They also deliver."}
{"text":"Had number 20 today and it was good.  Tons of toppings.  Sausage was good but very strong flavour.  On the whole still great pizza spot.  Not cheap but tasty.  Very friendly staff too..."}
{"text":"It was a good tasting pizza but with fresh ingredients but do not expect it to be like an Italian Pizza, is more like a Middle East pizza. 
The  ingredients that they use are just average, (not the best cheese) especially if you are thinking about Neapolitan kind of Pizza. if you feel like eating just to calm your appetite than you will be ok.
For the same price you can eat in places like Gusto 101, pizzería Libretto and many more"}
{"text":"The pizza here is delicious and I've tried some of their other menu items (salad and wings) and they were great too. The reason I'm only giving them 3 stars is because the people who work there are always rude and it's way too small/busy to eat in there. 

The woman who works the cash/takes phone calls has never smiled once in the many times we've gone there. We are never greeted by anyone when we walk in. I've seen the owner socialize with some of his customers (probably regulars) but he wasn't any kinder to me the last time I was there. Since I'm pregnant and on maternity leave, I went during the day to pick up a pizza when no one was there. I sat down and waited. A lady walked in with her 2 kids and the owner made me get up and move (again, I'm pregnant) even though the woman had an option of sitting ANYWHERE and she even insisted I stay seated. I was only taking up one seat so I have no idea what that was about. We found a better pizza place nearby anyway where the staff don't have poles up their butts."}
{"text":"Stopped in here then night before I got married. We were just looking for a basic pizza after a long day of running around but were surprised with a really delicious pizza! 

The pizza tastes super fresh, quality ingredients and is made with love. Prices are slightly higher than the chains but they make up for it with quality. 

Will definitely be returning for another pizza soon."}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews about Dino's, I decided to get a pie to go. I ordered a medium Famosa and have to say it is one of the best pizza's I have tasted in Toronto. Thin crust was perfect and the center was not wet a flimsy. I think that when the pizza comes right out the oven and its very hot, the thin center may cave in. However on take-out, where the pizza has a bit of time to cool down, it was perfect.

Love pizza where you still have a bit of residue flour on the bottom, a couple of burnt bubbles and and even topping coverage from center to edge. Dino's pizza scored very high in all areas. Because of the thin crust, a medium pizza could satisfy one hungry person.

The price is a little higher than the chains but the taste is so much better! The interior is small but comfortable enough to eat in. Located on the North side of the Queensway just West of Royal York."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try spot for eat in or take-out.  The crust on the pizza is spectacular - thin, crispy and delicate inside.  I am getting hungry just thinking about it.  The pides are to die for, especially when combined with the garlic butter sauce and a touch of fresh basil.  Stop in, say hi to Dino and try a wood burning pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza and service was excellent. Dino and his staff are very nice. The crust was excellent. Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Ordered an extra large capriciosa for take out with a dipping sauce.  The cost came to 31$ with tax.

The pizza is large enough to fill four hungry people without any problems.  

Part of the crust was slightly burned, but still edible.  The rest of the pizza was very delicous.  The crust was thin and you could notice it was not filled with fat.  The ingredients were not over packed but defiently did not leave the pizza bear. 

Would definetly order over Pizza Pizza any day."}
{"text":"Just a block away from Kaji, it seems as though there's a higher concentration of indie 'za joints in this part of Etobicoke, re:  Milano's, FBI, Il Paesano, etc.  Personally, this was the first one out of the list that I've been to!

Tip:  Paid, street parking, free after 6pm.  There's also parking on Loma Rd., the street just West of Dino's, and surrounding res, free after 6pm.

The restaurant itself is quite small.  Only a few tables + a coupla outside with umbrellas.  It's somewhat dated, looks like an old sub shop/roti joint.

What you will notice as soon as you walk in is the wood burning oven...which contrary to its name is make out of bricks/clay.  Again, I'm not sure that the other pizza places around can boast about having one as I haven't been to the others.

The 2 girls working there were really nice and welcoming.  The smallest 12\" contains 6 pieces (~$15) while 15\" has 8 pieces (~$20), obviously price depends on the kind of ingredients.  I'm soo GLAD that this place has an actual pizza menu, as opposed to those places that charge a basic price + $/ingredients that you choose.  

The pizza itself took about 15-20mins to roll out.  You have the option of having fresh (& free!) basil leaves put on and there are a coupla herbed oils/chilli flakes available.  Pizza + ingredients were very fresh!

Recommended, would go back without any hesitation!"}
{"text":"Had a pizza delivered the other night. Man on the phone was very friendly and they even delivered up to Runnymede/Annette! The pizza was delicious, real wood fired pizza. Reminded me of the closest thing to  my regular pizza joint in NYC, which I've been searching for for years. Hoping that my subsequent pizzas will 'deliver' the same results."}
{"text":"One of our new favorite pizza places that we recently discovered! We especially love the New York pizza and Gyro Pide!! Absolutely delicious and highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"'Pide' - I thought it was a typo for pizza pie. 
Pide is a special kind of pizza wirh garlic butter in the crust! Blendimg.the delicious flavour of garlic bread with your favourite pizza together!
You gotta try this...i found it amazingly sized for a personal Pizza. Bring your appetito. Two can share one if you light eaters.
First time but definitely coming back for more. All the Staff are friendly and accommodating too! Funny how the best places are like that!
5 out of 5 from me!!"}
{"text":"I had a hankering for some pide recently and didn't want to trek out east to pizza pide.... after a quick google search I found that Dino's had some!  We ordered the beef pide and the egg pide and we were not disappointed!  They have a bit more of an Italian spin on pide, which is different from what I've had in Turkey and in the east of Toronto- they seem to add fresh basil and garlic butter to their pide which is delicious, but not what I was expecting!  I will look forward to trying the others...!"}
{"text":"This restaurant fell short for me. It was mediocre at best, I was expecting so much more but unfortunately the taste just wasn't there. I got the pizza a pollo and there was nothing special about it. It tasted like a frozen pizza...and it wasn't even hot nor was the cheese melted through. Much ado about nothing. That was my first and last time eating here."}
{"text":"Absolute fire pizza and wings. Italiano was great, but the meat lovers was some of the best pizza I've ever had. 
There isn't a lot of seating, so I'd suggest going during off hours or being prepared to wait/pickup."}
