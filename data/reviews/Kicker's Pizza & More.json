{"text":"The original name used to be Muntean's. The new owners kept the original buffalo wings recipe. I think they're the best around. The blue cheese dip is  also from the original owner, and is soooo addictive! It's made from scratch. Their prices can be a little high tho. Best bet is to get their wings on Wednesday, when they're on special. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. They use giant pepperoni on their pizzas. And the crust isn't that factory style crust hand made."}
{"text":"If you can deal with their horrible customer service long enough to complete your order, you will enjoy some very delicious food."}
{"text":"Where do I even Begin? I had called Kickers and the woman who picked up was not friendly, I had told her I was at a hotel and she is asking me for my room telephone number, I felt like I was being interrogated for buying food, so instead my fiance called back and placed the order, He wanted a Philly burger meal not Philly steak also I had asked for a fanta to be replaced not 2 fantas , I called back to try and explain this and this woman's head was so far up her ass trying to justify the order complete weirdo and unprofessional the food was disgusting and I do not recommend anyone to eat here. This rating doesn't even deserve a rating instead of a big fat 0. We ended up throwing the food in the garbage. The only person who was pleasant was the driver."}
{"text":"Ordered 50 wings for the Superbowl last night.  The wings usually are good but it has been awhile since I've ordered from them. So I pick the order up get home and the wings wasn't like I've had them before won't order from them ever again. Today the boss reached out and confirmed one off the Fryer's was off some degrees, gave me another order or wings and it's just like old times. I'll be ordering those BBQ wings again."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from Kicker's for a company event that ran Monday-Wednesday. Monday, our order arrived on time. The food was not very good, but since we had preordered, we did not want to cancel our order for the next two days. Tuesday, the delivery driver got lost twice, and ended up arriving late. Once the food was delivered Tuesday, I called to adjust our order for Wednesday, since we were going to have a few less attendees than planned. The woman that answered the phone, rudely told me to call back after 1 o'clock, when their lunch rush was over. After 1 o'clock, I called back, and cancelled our order, and placed the order elsewhere. I will not be bringing my personal, or company business back to Kicker's."}
{"text":"Sad to say not my favorite pizza. I love supporting local family owned business, so of all the pizza places area, we chose Kickers. I have never been here before  but had decent reviews.  We got a veggie pizza and a pepperoni double. The pepperoni pizza was fairly decent however I really didn't care for the sauce. I am more a veggie type pizza person so I was really looking forward to the veggie pizza. I must say I was really disappointed in this one. The cross was soggy probably from the finally chopped vegetables. I normally like my veggies with a little bit of size. We got onion, green pepper, tomato, and jalape√±o on this one. All theveggies were finally chopped which probably created more moisture that went into the pizza crust. The sauce was a little sweet for me but I guess it was OK. We also got some hot wings, a dozen mild and a dozen hot. They were a little small in size however were cooked crispy and had good flavor. I most likely will not return the kickers due to the fact of not liking the pizza.to end on a positive note, this establishment is closed on Sundays which is a rarity these days so I applaud them in their efforts."}
{"text":"Kicker's Pizza is a Brook Park treasure!! The wings are amazing and the chicken philly is quite possibly the perfect sandwich. The homemade blue cheese should be sold in stores, too. The pizza is made from scratch - no frozen crusts or canned sauce. It's the real deal. Try the wing pizza or the BLT Pizza for something unique."}
