{"text":"I moved out of the area a while ago but yesterday the food memory of their amazing hangover cure, the Bacon Cheeseburger, came floating into my brain....    I probably wouldn't have gone in had it not been recommended by a friend.  From the street it's dark and smallish, but opens up at the back.  It's appropriately outdated - it IS a diner after all - and the type of place that gives you a bottle of Everfresh juice with a glass and straw.    Back to the burger:  It's big, simple and delicious.   Golden brown chunky fries and a Caesar round out the experience nicely.  I'm seriously considering making the trek up soon.  And by soon, I mean tonight."}
{"text":"This is our go to greasy spoon when we want something a little 'nicer' than average :) Consistently delicious food."}
{"text":"We went for Saturday breakfast. Great value. Sausages, 1 egg, toast, potatoes, and coffee for $5.55 is hard to beat. Service was fast a friendly. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, excellent food, friendly staff and SO clean!  Best breakfast in East York by far."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for brunch with my husband. Haven't been there in a few years and decided to try it out again. We were both disappointed when we walked in and seen the same miserable server was still working there. Tall woman with glasses that never smiles and makes you feel like you're inconveniencing her. Our food was alright. It was hot but nothing special. The home fries were just sliced potatoes that were a little hard to cut through and very few of. When we went to pay with debit they said cash only and that the debit would be there on Monday. Would've been nice if we were told that prior to ordering so I didn't have to stand there while my husband ran to 7-11 to use the ATM. I would've just ate somewhere else as I wanted to leave once I seen the server anyways."}
{"text":"typical greasy spoon.  very inconsistent. menu is pretty big so chances are the hot turkey sandwich meat was roasted last week.  soups are all premade. breakfast special is 5.99 with 3 \" meats\" so don't expect too much. ownership has changed several times in the past 5-6 years and this I think has had an effect on food . I keep saying I'll never go back , but seem to return for a quick fix that gets me thru the day."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend, for brunch on February 15th. I was very disappointed. I had received a good review from a friend, but I was not impressed. The food was good, but the billing was not clear. The menu said that extra peameal bacon was only $4.49 extra but when the bill arrived we were charged $10.99. PLUS $2.00 for an \"open food charge\". When we asked what that meant, we were brushed off, and the waitress said \"Yeah, I know it's really expensive I don't wanna take all your money\". Excuse me?! If you didn't want to \"take all our money\" then why did you charge us that? It was very confusing and unclear. The food was great, but the waitress was very confusing, and didn't check on us mid meal so I sat most of our meal without water. I tried to flag her down but she was too concerned about the door alarm not functioning properly. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers of my life. Definitely coming back again. Super tasty and cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Back in the day when Peter Peter Pumpkin water was running the show was when this place was any good.  Although, Peter would be counting his bills behind the counter freaking out when he wasn't making enough of money."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch. $37. Eggs Bene and hot turkey sandwich.     I wanted to love it. But just couldn't  1. Ask for eggs poached soft arrived hard.   2. Asked for well done potatoes.  Under cooked.   3.  Hot Turkey dry with a concoction of frozen vegg saut√©ed in butter/margarine over salted.  Cold mash and cold gravy.    4.  Food 3/10.  5. Waitress did her job not overly friendly but efficient  FYI.  Hot turkey is served with 2 slices of bread and peas always.    FYI #2.  Eggs Bene is always served with oozing yolks unless requested otherwise.   FYI #3.  Wasn't busy 2 tables.  How do u get this sooo wrong.   Coke in bottle was good. And tea was good too !  Won't be back"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Hard to find anything wrong with this place.  We all had good, standard breakfasts served by an attentive waitress who looks like she's been there a while.  The weak link was the standard, boring \"Wonder\" brown toast.  If most diner coffee is a 5/10, this was a 6.  The stand-out was the chunky, real home fries, fried with love on the griddle.*  *not frozen \"tots\", not deep fried, not fried to a mush.  Chunky and recognizable as potatoes.  Nice!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I'm a huge fan of Donlands' breakfasts. Fast service - food was served 5 minutes after I ordered it, and it was fresh. I really like their western sandwiches there."}
{"text":"Really the only place I go for breakfast. The servers are exceptionally pleasant and have been there for a long time so their menu suggestions are always helpful. The food is really good quality at a super cheap price, and the menu offers a wide variety of dining options but breakfast is what Donlands is most famous for. You can't go wrong with one of their breakfast combos. They serve breakfast all day too, super bonus. I love the look of the place! Wish more restaurants had an authentic old school vibe. My family and I are regulars at this diner. Definitely try it out if you're a morning foodie!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this place regularly . We love this place. Great service. Lovely food and just an over all great atmosphere. They have done some renovations , so the current pictures online don't do it any justice. They have a nice big picture of Marilyn Monroe who I'm a sucker for and other cute vintagey things."}
{"text":"3.5 greasy spoons of goodness.  If you don't live in the east end, nor have any friends here, then you can stop reading now 'cause it's good, but not good enough to make the trek.  The staff saved our collective lives on New Years Day as we were all out of Clamato and a little \"tired\" to be dealing with eggs and appliances.   The food was perfectly greasy spoon: greasy, cheap, plentiful and with real breakfast potatoes and not some frozen crap or left over fries from some other person's plate or whatever else some awful places have served me in the past.   The service was great, especially considering our state and the amount of equally hangry and hangry-over customers waiting for salvation.  It's way off the beaten path, but soooo worth it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I visited Donlands with a small group last week for breakfast.  The diner itself looks new and is very clean.  The portions were quite generous and our sever was very friendly.  The food was ok.  The potatoes that came with the meals were undercooked and could have been seasoned a little better.  The poutine gravy could have also used a little more flavour.  But overall it was a pleasant place to eat and there is potential for this place to be something special in the neighborhood.  I'd go back to try some of the other things on the menu given the chance."}
{"text":"Amazing food with a old school vibe!   Love having breakfast here after a night of partying!"}
{"text":"The Donlands Restaurant (affectionately known as the diner by the locals) was good ole home cooking. The service was very slow (and a bit cranky) and the milkshake I was brought was actually only a nestle quik strawberry mix (let's just say not so good)."}
{"text":"This is an old fashion diner, and it's been in the neighborhood for over 20 years. Everything is cooked to order, so the fries are always warm and crisp.  Their breakfasts and burgers are particularly popular, but they make a great Salisbury and Parmigiana too.  I highly recommend their Western and the veal sandwich.  I am definitely a fan of this place.  I come here all the time because it's close to one of my offices for work.   It's like Cheers, Where Everybody Knows Your Name. One of the waitresses has been there for 22 years, and she remembers all the regulars and what they like to eat. I've seen one regular who has never even placed an order, he sits down and of she goes to get his favourite food."}
{"text":"Great place that gives you BIG portions.  I have been here a few times for breakie and I can never finish it lol from the photos it looks like I have to try dinner here soon."}
{"text":"Used to be great, daughter and I had many hockey morning breakfasts there. Newly renovated, they've raised the prices - significantly - and the food quality, at least on my first try, was way down from before.   Had the all-day breakfast, basic bacon, eggs, hashbrowns, toast. Coffee now extra $2.   Bacon was pre-cooked and re-grilled. Hashbrowns likewise, except they were neither re-grilled (cold in middle, not crispy), and way over cooked. The eggs were fresh.   Unfortunate that a hipster-esque retro-reno (bad enough on its own) led them to think they could raise the prices. Maybe if the food remained top notch this would fly. I liked the quaintness and authenticity of the old place, a good cleaning, painting and some refurb of the furniture would have been a better investment IMO.   Will try again, maybe they're just getting up to speed, and deserve a second chance."}
{"text":"We've been coming to the resturant for years. Now that it's under new management it is even better then it was years ago! The food is fresh and delicious, especially the hot hamburger dinner.. delicious!! And their breakfast is to die for. Most importantly the place is spotless.. it glitters! I love Sharon the waitress she knows everyone's order and takes the time to chat with each and every customer. I love the family feel to this amazing resturant. Do yourself a favour and go have a fresh delicious meal at this place. We travel from Markham to eat our favourite meal here.. mmm hot hamburger!"}
{"text":"Been dropping in to the Donlands on and off for years Wouldn't say it's exceptional but i would say it's consistent and offers some good choices from a varied menu. Pretty well anything you chose at this diner will hit the spot. The owners are always pleasant and the service is always top notch. This retro diner doesn't pretend to be retro since it's been that way since the 60s. Now that they scored a new Coke machine and added 80s Cokes in glass bottles it just adds to the charm.  I had the lamb dinner that came with soup and desert, coffee for about $15 added a Coke and walked out stuffed and satisfied for less than $20 The lamb melted in your mouth, the homemade chicken noodle soup warmed you up and the Coconut cream pie left me a happy camper.  If you want feel good home food this is the place for you"}
{"text":"I'm only able to review the breakfast because that's all I ever order. One of the best greasy spoon restaurants in Toronto. The decor is from the 70s. Friendly service. The back bacon is perfect. Lots of butter on the toast. Can't complain about the home fries (large chunks). Not a bad cuppa coffee. If you want an old school diner experience for breakfast, this place is hard to beat."}
{"text":"1st visit today. Not impressed! Reno looks great, cozy & diner like on the inside but I don't know what it looked like prior.  Waitress somewhat friendly, had to send my meal back twice & finally didn't get to eat We'll try it again as its close. We'll give it another try"}
{"text":"I love these family owned greasy spoons. Egg Salad Sandwich and Fries. Toasted Westerns. OMG I am in my car going there now."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with it, just a goo old fashion diner.  Popular amongst musicians who record in the area and other residence, it's cheap comfort food.    Burgers, sandwiches, omelets, spaghetti, all day breakfasts, entrees like corned beef."}
{"text":"First (and probably last) time there. Read the reviews, was impressed with the 4 stars. Service is friendly enough, but the food, yikes. Had breakfast/brunch and it was terrible. Potatoes were really stale, like they had been sitting around for hours and then reheated. Bacon, sausages and eggs all tasted like they had been fried in old oil. I really wanted it to be good - I really did, as it's at a super convenient location. But unfortunately just a whole lotta nope."}
