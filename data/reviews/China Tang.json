{"text":"The manager pulled us aside in a private room and had a chefs menu prepared for us. Everything was spectacular and the food was amazing. Our waitress Jessica, was classy and had perfect service. I am so glad I came to truly experience how great this restaurant truly is. Every dish was prepared fresh and I highly encourage when in Vegas, go to China Tang!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Food served cold.
Not impressed with the quality, pepper steak had too much gristle and vegetarian fried rice was oily.
We were sat in a table with people walking within 3 feet of me . Some event exited and there was5000 people walking past my table.
Bad experience unfortunately . And for a high end Asian place I expect a lot more.
3 stars only because the service was pleasing...."}
{"text":"First: Our server Jessica was AMAZING! She was SO knowledgeable about the food, cocktails and very extensive wine list. She is the only reason I didn't give only 4 stars and that would have been only because the price which was high. LOVED the  unusual and delicious signature drinks- especially the Ms. Chin I believe it was called- A delicious unusual concoction of pear sorbet, a little champagne and lychee vodka amoung other delicious ingredients. Our food (especially the signature dishes sweet and sour soup and beef wagu fried rice) was outstanding! We are in Vegas often and understand most unique restaurants fall under the category of very pricey. I think the only reason they don't have a higher rating is people come expecting to have a normal Chinese food restaurant experience and that is not what this offers. They had a live Chinese singer that was fabulous and the vibe was much more engaging  and lively than your typical Chinese food restaurant. If you can't get a table the bar is a super fun place to hang with the full menu... The bartenders also were a wealth of knowledge and interest."}
{"text":"Came to dinner with my wife and sat at the lounge . They have a live singer in the main dining area , so it can get a little noisy . We asked the server to turn it down and he accommodated . This place has tons of seafood dishes and special dishes , but we were just trying to have a simple quiet meal . Our server Alex made some great recommendations , my favorite dish was the seabass hot pot. It's a must try . May come back later this year with thr company as they have nightly live singer and noodle pulling exhibitions I'm told . Overall great meal, great service . Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Restaurant is beautiful, ambience is wonderful and waitstaff is attentive. However, price is super duper high and meals DO NOT come with rice. You have to order separately and a dish of fried rice is $22.  Not a place to come on a whim."}
{"text":"We had just arrived to our hotel (MGM) and wanted a good meal but most places are closed until 5.  We decided to give this place a try as the advertisements left my mouth watering. You are instantly taken care of by multiple people when you walk in.  Even though it seems very upscale they make you feel very comfortable.  The server goes over in detail the menu and how it's served.  He leaves the menu with you so you can add more Dim Sum if you would like.  My daughter is very picky and just wanted noodles and broth and they asked the chef if he would do it and of course he did.  My husband ordered a noodle dish, which was delicious and I had started with two different Dim Sums.  I ended up going back for two more that our server had recommended.   All of which were delicious!  We probably spent more than what we anticipated for lunch but I actually go to Vegas for the food not for the gambling.  I would definitely come back to this place again!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????45?????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This place is amazing with great service I will definitely come back every time I visit Vegas"}
{"text":"Waaaaaaaaay over priced. Tiny portions. Good food and really amazing staff, but we were both still hungry after our ridiculously small overpriced dinners. We walked across the food court and ordered another meal for 1/10th the price and about as good. Walked away feeling ripped off. Never going back."}
{"text":"China Tang is a fantastic Chinese restaurant located in the MGM Grand that opened in late January 2018. From the 1st delicious bite of our appetizers, to the friendly staff focused on excellence, to the outstanding main dishes, it was a pleasure dining here. This restaurant is upscale and has a couple other locations in Hong Kong (the chef is from there). 

The food is a taste explosion of Cantonese deliciousness (with some Schezuan & traditional flavor influences). They have lobster and crab dishes which will run you a pretty penny; and also serve roast duck with a wait time of 45 mins-an hour to prepare. The Jasmine tea is also fantastic. We were pleasantly surprised at how awesome the food is here and were impressed by the friendly efficient staff. We'll definitely be back to try the lobster next time! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Soooooo, 5 stars for pretty much everything but the price.  Without the drinks, our dinner would have still come out to $100 which for Chinese food is a weeeeee-bit pricey.  Having said that, the food was super fresh and super delicious.  My kung pao shrimp wasn't at all spicy which I thought was kind of weird but they used big-o prawns.  It wasn't overly salty like a lot of Chinese food places but I've never been to a \"fancy\" Chinese restaurant before so I don't have much to compare it to.  If you do come here, get their bbq pork.  Of all the bbq porks I've ever had - being Chinese, I've had many - this is one of the best.  Thick, juicy slices.  You'll love it.  So yeah, 2 dishes and an appetizer is kind of out there for price but the ambiance is intimate and the live music is great.  If you want to splurge, this is a great place."}
{"text":"So, I want to give this place 3.5 stars, but I can't, so we're stuck at 3. :)
Essentially, I'm from LA and we have a lot of amazing Chinese food for half the price it is here. I get it. It's Vegas. But damn. lol

That said, the food we ordered was good. Soup dumplings were the perfect amount of warm soup and meat. Siu mai, although small, was flavorful. Sweet and sour soup was very good, but be warned that the $15 price is for a single cup serving. Sichuan pepper chicken--really tasty, but the chicken is fried (which I wasn't expecting) and buried in the sichuan peppers that it's cooked in, which adds a lot of flavor, but also a lot of dry spice.  Topped it off with the veggie noodles, which were tasty, but nothing super special.

We ordered a bottle of wine and it came out on a cart with a bunch of crazy looking decanters.  And the wine was also v tasty. I believe we ordered a pinot...

Overall, food was good, but not the most amazing I've ever had.  If you're visiting Vegas and haven't had some good Chinese food due to where you live, this wouldn't be a terrible place to try (and to spend lots of $$$$)."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have ever had. The dim sum, appetizers, entrees, and desserts were fantastic. Add in the fantastic service and it is a great experience."}
{"text":"We decided to have a little \"staycation\" night on the strip.  We started out at China Tang, which just opened inside MGM.  We sat in the lounge area to people watch, great ambiance and the rest of the restaurant looked super pretty.  Highlights were the BBQ pork appetizer, kung pao prawns, and fabulous wine and cocktail selections.  They also had a live singer which added a cool vibe.  Would totally go again to get a full dinner and try the peking duck."}
{"text":"China Tang is a beautiful fine dining restaurant. The food was deliciously flavorful and the sauces superb. The servers and bartenders are very knowledgeable and attentive. The cocktails are complex and beautifully fragrant. Add to your list!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal at China Tang! We ordered a spicy clay pot of grouper for two and it did not disappoint. Be sure to ask for Anson, he is a terrific server that made excellent recommendations and made our meal special."}
{"text":"I would give them a zero star if I could. They wouldn't let us in unless one of our friends removed his fedora, which is worn for religious purpose. We did inform the hostess of his religion and why he need to cover his head. They are ignorant and would discriminate against their guest. We were at the steakhouse the night before (which is way classier and way much expensive) and they didn't have a problem with the hat."}
{"text":"Very pricey even compare to Aria Chinese restaurant or Bellagio Chinese restaurant!
Food is good but not that great to pay $$$$$ for it!
I usually order lobster at any of the Chinese restaurant.But this restaurant charge 3 times more than any Chinese restaurant on the trip!And probably 10 times more than Chinatown Chinese restaurant!
So if you want to be rip off for nice ambiance Chinese restaurant,you got China Tang lol"}
{"text":"Such great flavor in every bite!  It's takes time to get your food since they make everything from scratch...but worth the wait (and price)."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst chinese food we have ever eaten. We ordered veg noodles at first they added meat and we sent it back. looks like they microwaved some preackaged noodles and brought them to us. Part of them were cold and sticky. 
Goto the food court and eat the food instead of wasting money in this place. My only star is for the waiter, he was nice and courteous."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed. Our party of 4 left HUNGRY. This establishment is very pricey.  Portions are tasty but very small. Everything is ala carte.  Rice does not come with the meals and the least expensive rice is $22.00. No soup or tea with the meal either. The food was good and the wait help nice. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant at 6:00pm. With our bill At $300 including tip we not only left hungry but feeling very ripped off."}
{"text":"Bleh.
The only thing I could think of is that they kept my water glass full.
It was really disappointing that my husband spend the amount of money for such a small amount of food. Hell, we could of gotten more food from McDonalds or Taco Bell for less. Our tummies were not remotely full by the conclusion of the meal. 
So words of advice, do not eat here!"}
{"text":"Poor service and basics not covered here, food decent but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Food not as good as expected comparing to the price. Environment and service are good though. However, we waited 30 minutes to get our dishes, need some patience on that."}
{"text":"Both the food and the service were excellent China Tang. We really loved the snacks and how the waitress was very patient with our order, definitely will come next time if we're in town."}
{"text":"Great service staff. Nice ambiance.  Food is generally good with a few misses (char siu was not so good).  Wayy overpriced menu.  This place straddles casual and fine dining, but is priced at fine dining.  May want to rethink"}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food I have ever had! Horrible, salty food.  We had to send back three dishes.  We asked to pay for what we ordered (chicken dumplings-appetizers, and I've had better) and they overcharged my credit card by $58.00.  After a dispute with the manager, I also had to call American Express.  Dishonest and over priced."}
{"text":"Do not eat here.  I spent over 130 dollars on meals that barely amounted to appetizers.  My wife and I left hungry and ripped off.  We could have gotten three actual meals for what we paid.  Thanks for being a damper on our honeymoon, China Tang.  McDonald's would have at least satisfied our hunger and only cost us 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Returned for dinner because lunch was so delicious. Our hometown doesn't have any good Chinese, much less GREAT Chinese food. We enjoyed the signature dishes and planned to try new stuff for dinner but ended up ordering a bunch of our same lunch items - though the new dishes we tried were also excellent. Live singer was a neat touch. Beware many items require preorder because of how long they take to cook!"}
{"text":"Ate here with friends recently and thought it was absolutely fantastic all around. The staff, the food, the drinks were all amazing. Some of the best service in Vegas from my experience, great ambiance and all round experience. Highly recommended if in Vegas, a must try! I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I was craving my comfort food, dim sum, so I thought I'd try this place based on reviews. Unfortunately although service was excellent, I'd say the high price was not justified by the mediocre food. Xiao Long Bao was pretty tasteless and Siu Mai had a very odd texture. $12 for a pot of tea? 
The braised noodles with shredded pork was just boring with spicy hoisin sauce. 
I grew up in Hawaii and frequented San Francisco's, two great Chinese food places and this place just didn't come even close. 
Save your money."}
{"text":"Went to China Tang for Dinner. One of the most expensive Chinese restaurant I have the opportunity to try. Food quality was excellent and the live music added good ambiance. Sui mai and dragon dumplings was very flavorful. BBQ pork (char siu) was one of the best char sui I've had. The beef spare rib was very tender and the gravy sauce was well balanced. The lemon chicken was not my favorite. The waiter warned that there is a thick crust of almond on the chicken (which I didn't mind). The lemon sauce, however, was not what I expected. I was hoping to be something like sweet and sour but it was more on the sour side. House fried rice was good but nothing extraordinary.
Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit but it's super pricy! Must get is definitely their cha sui and Shao mai. Everything it's just okkkk.. the wagu beef fried rice is nothing amazing, it's actually a little bland and flavorless.."}
{"text":"Everything is so expensive but they give tiny portions. All the food is very bland. Only good thing is the service."}
{"text":"Food ok. Way overpriced. Worst service I've ever had in Vegas. Left hungry, portions tiny."}
{"text":"If you want yo throws away your money, like we do in Vegas.  This is the place to eat.  I don't even want to explain the details of my experience but hit the food court instead."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience at China Tang. I had a reservation so there was no wait for seating. The service was excellent as was the food. The ambiance was great, especially with the live music.

Do not go to China Tang is you are expecting PF Chang's style. PF's is not legit Chinese food, China Tang is!

Also, a special thank you to Michael Yi, the GM, for taking the time to check in with us and talking about the story behind China Tang. I did not realize that the flagship property is in China. 

China Tang is easily one of my new favorites in Vegas."}
{"text":"First off I have to state that I never eat cuisine like this so I was way out on a limb walking into the restaurant. Those fears were immediately put to rest when David, our waiter, came to the table. The first thing that stood out to me was that he used my last name as an introduction and immediately I was impressed. Made an old school connection in new school Vegas. 
     David explained everything on the menu expertly and with detail unparalleled in most places I eat.  I won't even try to name the dishes we ate because I will never accurately describe them. But take my word for it, they were delicious and well worth the delay we had getting them. 
     Yes, there was a delay getting our food. It happens and both the manager and David were very attentive and gracious about the issue. And the restaurant picked up a dessert for both of us so the matter was resolved on the spot without complaint. And the desserts suggested by David wee spot on, so that was a bonus. 
     I don't normally take the time to review on this platform, but this place stood out and I can't recommend them enough if you are in Vegas. Thanks so much China Tang."}
{"text":"We had dinner at China Tang a few nights ago. We didn't have reservations but we were sat at a table quickly. The service here is amazing. They know how to take care of customers. The food was good but very pricey. Everything seemed fresh and had great flavor. My noodle dish was $26 and my husband's rice dish was $28. We both thought that was a lot for fried rice."}
{"text":"We loved it.  This was such a wonderful experience.  The service was impeccable and exactly what we needed.  I believe our server was named David and he had the best descriptions to offer of everything from drinks, to appetizers, to entrees.  He really made me want to order everything he described...and I nearly did.

We started with Dim Sum.  I'm not an aficionado, but this seemed legit.  Our server explained some of the proper ways to eat each one to gain the full experience.  Our children loved them.  Each of our entrees was perfect as well.  We tried the lemon chicken, fried rice, and three cup chicken all served family-style.  We also ordered some of the crispy vegetables which I would recommend to augment any meal.  They perfectly cooked and the mushrooms were a real treat.

My perception of the meal was that it was all authentic.  If it wasn't, I don't want to know it.  We will return to China Tang."}
{"text":"I was craving dan dan noodles and I thought they had dan dan noodles on their menu but they don't have this option anymore on their menu. I got the braised noodles instead. I think it's weird and inconvenient that they don't do phone orders. If you want to do a to go order you have to go to the bar and order it in person and wait for it which is the silliest thing I've heard. I had to wait 20 minutes for the food instead of just calling ahead and just picking it up. The server was friendly and nice. The food was not worth the money. It was overpriced and they gave me the smallest amount of food. There wasn't much pork on the noodles and I was very disappointed. The amount of spice was good though. I definitely think they have a lot of improvements to make. The Grand Wok that was open before in the mgm was better."}
{"text":"Let's start with a great service, host, server and bartender.
We tried the fried sea bass, beef with fired garlic, fried rice, and beef dumpling. The best out of all was the sea bass, highly recommended. A little pricy for the small plates, at least $40 per person. But I think worth it"}
{"text":"Staying at MGM wanted some Chinese takeout.  There is a Chinese place in the food court, but it didn't look spectacular.  Saw China Tang and figured to myself, hey that has to be better so went for some takeout.  TERRIBLE value.  The taste for $38 for 1 entree wasn't much above the food court place that had 3 entrees for $11.99.  Here is a photo and the key card to show the size comparison of how much food I received.  Originally I had a 1 star, I changed to 3 stars.  Thanks for Yvette for being concerned and offering an amicable solution.  I will try China Tang again and look forward to a better experience."}
{"text":"This place probably has the best Peking duck in the west coast (Sorry Meizhou Dongpo and Duck house in LA). While they carved their duck table side, they served it in three different cuts (skin only, skin with fat and meat, and meat only) Our server explained in details in regards to how each cut should pair with which condiments including their handmade dough wrap in the bamboo basket. Their preparation, attention to details and presentation of this dish is one of the best outside of Asia. Upon finishing the dish, our server brought us a \"white nugget\" on a plate and he poured hot water into it and it \"pop\" into a finger towel! Very thoughtful service and I hope this restaurant will continue these practices and use their cuisine to lead and elevate the Cantonese cuisine in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"A must try if you're near the MGM and looking for some delicious Chinese food.  They have an expansive lunch menu and they are willing to serve you dim sum for dinner as well.  The crispy duck takes about an hour to prepare once you place your order, but it's so worth the wait.  Friendly staff, Yvette and her team will make sure your dining experience is memorable for sure."}
{"text":"Couldn't quite give it a four unfortunately (maybe 3.5).  It is kind of snooty to begin with, which I don't get.  There were plenty of open tables but we waited over 30 minutes to be seated.  We sat at the bar while we waited and the bartenders were nice but the drinks were just so-so (and expensive).  Once seated we ordered a few appetizers for our table and some more drinks.  The waiter was pretty attentive but everything seemed to take a while.  Appetizers were okay, nothing remarkable.  Dinner also was good but nothing remarkable.  The cost was outrageous.  I would not recommend this place when there are so many other really good places to go."}
{"text":"Went Friday night party of 5. Decor and service was a 4. The food and price was a 1 Star.  Spring rolls and Dim Sum were good the most disappointing part of our dinner was the main entrees. Very small dishes with high prices, the black pepper beef was heavy in fat we only ate half the dish. A friend ordered the noodle and shrimp dish as she does not eat meat. Her meal came out 15 mins after ours as we were told there was only one working wok !  By the time her meal came out all of our food was stone cold. Our bill was over $300 we had 6 dishes and 4 drinks. The entrees are very small and since our food was cold we left half as it was no longer edible. Unfortunately we left hungry and ended up at In N Out. Was so excited to try this new restaurant and left unhappy."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and service high end. The dumplings were amazing as was the vegetable spring rolls. The noodles with shrimp very tasty as well. Great decorations and great food. We will come back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful room excellent service disappointing food at huge price. 
Fried rice at 28$ ?
Not my kind of Chinese unfortunately. 
Very good drinks and wonderful 
Outgoing friendly staff."}
{"text":"We came for the noodles at lunch and came back the same night for dinner. Everything was excellent and the staff is incredible. If you like authentic Chinese cuisine do not miss it."}
{"text":"I am of Cantonese ancestry and grew up in Vancouver BC where Cantonese food is very good. As such, i consider i have pretty high standards when it comes to Chinese food.
My husband and 12 yo daughter ate here one evening before a show. We had an appetizer, 2 entrees (both specials, both seafood dishes), a vegetable dish and house made egg tarts for dessert. The food was incredibly flavorful without being salty and the egg tarts were fluffy, flaky and the custard was silky. The wine pairing suggestion was perfect.
The service was outstanding and they were mindful of our time.
The price was that of a high end restaurant, so don't expect your typical American Chinese diner prices. When it comes to fine dining, you can expect the quality and service to match the price point."}
{"text":"Terrible food, brutally bad service, and somehow even worse management. The worst dining experience I've had in Vegas in years. Ended up at the freaking food court afterward. I'd write a more detailed review, but it's not worth it. It won't last long. Avoid this place at all costs. It sucks."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with family n amazing authentic Chinese food.  The dim sum was fresh and perfect.  The noodles, truffle wagu fried rice and soup were the best we ever had.  We stay at MGM 3-5 times a year and this restaurant will be a MUST for all of us.  Jessica our waitress was sweet, friendly and very knowledgeable of the diverse menu.   So attentive!  Fresh squeezed watermelon juice was so refreshing.  Club soda, watermelon, lime n vodka makes for an exceptional drink."}
{"text":"I was disappointed.. I really wasn't sure what to order on the menu the server was not helpful and did not explain what I was getting.. we went there for a special evening .. a big birthday celebration. We ended up just guessing/ ordering and we ended up with a small plate of shredded chicken ( appetizer) and a plate of broccoli steamed also small .. this was the main dish.. a glass of wine and a beer ended up being over a hundred dollars and I was still hungry .. and this food was just boring..we stayed at this hotel and found much better food elsewhere"}
{"text":"I am very impressed with this location. I remember three years ago, it was also a Chinese Resturant. This place has done a major make-over and the place is very nice and well decorated with nice furniture and artwork. 

I was immediately greeted when we walk to the entrance and was told the day before was their Grand Opening- Congratulations. 

I was drawn to the location because the aroma was just too captivating stealing me away from the Resturant just right across the way. The ambiance just seemed so similar to an experience I had in Hong Kong - a very memorable be positive experience! 

I wished I had taken pictures of our first dish. It was the Peking Duck- prepared in such a pristine way, that our mouth watered as our palates couldn't wait for the first morsel to be devoured. Wow...

Dish after dish came out and nothing less than excellence hit our table. I could go on and on about this place, but I would recommend you try it our for yourself. Foodies, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner at the bar! Service was impeccable! The cold spinach with sesame sauce was perfectly chilled the sauce was nutty and creamy perfection! The roast pork appetizer was just as remarkable, a glazed slice of pig heaven! Might have to put it on repeat for my last night in Vegas"}
{"text":"So impressed with this restaurant. Wasn't sure if it would live up to the hype but it didn't disappoint. We sat with a group of 10 and ordered a bunch of dim sum, appetizers, and signature drinks and they were all so yummy! The cocktails are very creative and the food is the most authentic I have seen in Vegas. It wasn't Americanized as many places tend to do. This is a winner. The singer and noodle pulling are both great added bonuses."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for what you get.

Lowlights:
- Dim Sum was good but small.  $15 for 4 tiny pieces of Shrimp Dumpling and Siu Mai - it's typically $6 an order at good dim sum restaurants in the SF bay area
- Entrees also small and didn't wow us at over $30 a dish
- Simmered Rice Vermicelli Soup Noodle served with packaged udon that was still clumped together
- Brought out wrong vegetable orders 
- Waitress asked us if we wanted a dish that they made in mistake when putting in our order (not complimentary)

Restaurant was also empty when we went and I have a feeling it's going to stay that way."}
{"text":"Great service, gorgeous room/ambiance with the live singer and the duck is a must! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yalll... with all these Asian people working here and how they got Chinese music and the set up and all I would think their dim sum is on point but I was wrong y'all!! 4 TINY pieces of xiao long bao for $11-13??? Bruhhh.... save yourself the trip and
Go to China town or somewhere off the strip. Our waiter messed up our order as well. They brought out an extra order and took forever on another order."}
{"text":"The food was not bad even if the portions were tiny. The service however was horrible. They had one very talkative waiter that appeared to be the principal waiter due to his fluent English...and than they had an auxiliary personnel which was crowding our table. Every 2 minutes someone was coming to the table. I kid you not! It was very weird. They were abusive. As soon as one waiter brought over a tiny bowl of rice another waiter came to the table to take it away. I took the abuse the first 10 times but on the 11th time I just screamed at one woman to give us some rest and space. Perhaps they acted that way because we did not order an alcoholic drink. Therefore  they were mad at us trying to rush us out. It was pretty nasty! The atmosphere was based on SELL, SELL and again SELL policy. It felt as if we have entered some used car salesman shop from China. They were very aggressive. We come to a restaurant to relax and enjoy the food. What kind of enjoyment can you get in that abusive atmosphere? It is acceptable to demonstrate interest by asking how we were doing but they could not care less. In fact, they were openly hostile because we did not meet their financial expectation. I saw how the waitress I screamed at to give us peace demonstratively was passing on my irritation with the place to another waiter. As soon as she finished telling him he rushed over to our table to pick up the wine glasses. The fact that we were eating did not concern him.  Can you imagine going to a restaurant to be mistreated while still paying them a pretty penny? Would never recommend that place! It is unfortunate that a reputable hotel like the MGM Grand would rent its space out to such establishment. What was the management of the MGM Grand thinking when it brought the China Tang restaurant in? They probably solicit the good reviews from their friends. Considering a good number of negative reviews they should take it in consideration but I am sure they would reply to me in the same standard manner they have responded to other negative reviews."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience at this restaurant. The design and ambiance was classy and relaxing. The food was amazing. I had the Xiao Long Bao and fried rice. Our waiter Rashad was excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant. You forget that you're in a hotel in Vegas; it's just a really nice restaurant."}
{"text":"A fantastic addition to this MGM property. We had lunch here and everything we had was very good. We had many of the dim sum items as well as the crispy sea bass , the Kung Pao chicken and the Curry noodles with shrimp. As I stated, everything was very good but the stand outs to me were the Barbecue pork, the pork Bao, Crab wontons and the crispy sea bass. What China Tang really excelled in was service. We were taken care of by David, who was attentive and helpful without hovering and being overbearing. We were also attended to by the Sommelier Drea who China Tang was smart to steal away from the Caesars properties. I highly recommend utilizing her if you need assistance with wine choices. I went off the outdated information on a website so did not know that we had the option to order the 2 special dishes they are known for, the \"Hammer\" Chicken and the Roasted Duck at lunch but next time will definitely try those two dishes
All said it was an extremely enjoyable lunch, thanks in large part to Drea and David"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Las Vegas!!! And better than 99% of Chinese restaurants in LA!!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star... DO NOT GO! Bad food & even worst service, broccoli came out cold & service was so shitty they actually gave us the wrong bill & they were not even busy for a Sat night, should have been our 1st hint."}
{"text":"Pros: Food is decent, service is good, live music is cool

Cons: management is unethical. Went with a large group and they tried to swindle us by attempting to triple the price of the meal after we already agreed on a menu and price. Also portion sizes are tiny for the price.

If you want to get ripped off come here. Otherwise, tons of other good restaurants on the strip to choose from.


UPDATE: management has reached out to my group and apologized for what happened. The assistant manager that tried to rip us off has left the restaurant, and they have promised to turn it around. I was satisfied with how they handled our complaints and am updating this review to reflect that. Look forward to eating here next time I'm in Vegas and see the improvements they've made"}
