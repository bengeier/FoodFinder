{"text":"Awesome place. Since being under new management this place has really upped their game. Full bar and grill now with a up beat friendly staff. Black light racing every night is awesome and the new bar staff is super impressive! One down fall though, an update on the inside of the bar area is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Intended to buy one go kart race, was told I could get a second race for 50% off, given the time the two races were suppose to run (in the next 45 minutes) I made the purchase. It took over an hour to run the first race. During the next race before mine a wheel breaks off the kart. They begin shutting down before I can run my second race. It was suppose to start at 10:57pm, it is now 12:30am. I'm then told by the manager that I am basically SOL and I can't get a refund. Asking who I contact to file a complaint the clerk tells me I go on Google and write a review, which makes this ironic but still unappreciated. Overall horrendous customer service and the idea I can be sold a service that isn't fulfilled on and that I'm SOL is outrageous. Will never be back. There's enough go kart places in the valley."}
{"text":"Oh my where do I start the customer service was just downright horrible we were told and hour wait and we were fine with that but then it turned into 2 hour wait then when we tried to get a refund they almost wouldn't do it. No apologie from the owner nothing. Just shocked with how we were treated."}
{"text":"Although staff is friendly and helpful they are struggling here, unorganized and run by young adults. We came in at 4pm and were told to come back at 6:15pm to race. It's now 7:15pm and we still haven't raced. They are out of sleeves for the helmets. Note helmet visors are all scratched up, obstructs a clear view. Also, there is no way of knowing when your race is.....   A suggestion would be to have a 15 minute waiting period area where we have to be to avoid delays. Also to place a race schedule on the wall screen.   If there wasn't the long delay in waiting more stars would have been given."}
{"text":"If you consider your weekend time valuable then this is the place to avoid. Arrived at approximately 4:00 p.m. on 8/3/2014 Sunday afternoon and purchased 3 races for our two (2) 18 year old children. Cashier could not print out ticket and provided hand written ticket for races 47, 49 and 50. First race they were able to get in was race 53 one (1) hour later. What a fiasco after that, Each of the next races they were supposed to be in they were denied because the cashier could not provide information about the hand written ticket he provided and the races were full. 3 + hours later they were able to get into their last paid race. Prior to race they were told because of the long day they had they would throw in two or three races. In the last race one of their cars would not operate and they were given a replacement car on the last lap of the race. After the race was over the staff said they would provide one (1) race to the childs whose car did not operate. Additionally the place offers $5,00 RC rentals for cart racers. They were unable to honor this deal. They stated the RC cars had been ran too hard during the day and no more rentals were being offered, Very unorganized and unhelpful personnel. I am also in the customer service sector and provide my customers a better explanation then \"I just started my shift and I don't know whats going on up front, but I CAN NOT get you into the next race a previously promised."}
{"text":"Terribly disorganized. Youth and adults use same karts, with youth throttled slower.  Smaller youths will need pedal extenders and struggle with arm strength to make sharp turns.  Cannot redeem RC car vouchers after 1:00p.  Advertised free WiFi,  but did not have it."}
{"text":"Best cart place in town. Old school feel. Great customer service and plenty of other things to see and do."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Did not honor groupon. Rude about it. Don't come here. Long wait too. Been to several other go kart places that have a far better experience."}
{"text":"They are very unorganized and do not provide correct information. We went a week ahead to this place to get all the info regarding karting and they told us there was a birthday party at 1pm so we would need to come in at 10am to get any karting in. Saturday comes and we show up at 10am and they say they have a party and cant book any races and to come back at noon (total opposite of what the other girl said). We come back at 12:30 and book the races and were told its a 1hr wait, 2 hrs later we try to get an update and the people running the track cant give a clear answer as to when it will be our turn. Its is now 4:45pm and we are finally done and I never plan on coming here again."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else. We were told that it would be 20-30 minutes for a race. Then we were told it would be 5 or 6 races. Poorly run place. It's a shame that there isn't a better outdoor track that is actually run effectively. Would give it zero stars if it was an option."}
{"text":"This place was great! Went there for my birthday, and the service was excellent! Tristan, the track attendant, was very helpful and friendly. I will definitely be back, and will recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"What do you do with a former K-Mart building that has been closed and vacant for several years? Apparently you put in an indoor go-cart racing track, RC car racing, and a complete hobby shop catering to RC car enthusiasts.  I was pleased to see that this is here now and I will probably be taking my kids back at some point. Now you'll want to save up some money because it's initial layout of $25 per kid for safety training and the first race, but who goes to only race one time? Additional races are anywhere from $10-12 for kids and adults but its a fun experience and definitely would be a great place to visit when summer temperatures are hot!  Oh, and I'm not going to get into RC car racing, but watching it is fun. There are at least three tracks, including a big dirt track inside, and you can watch from above so you get a complete overview. I'm not sure how much the birthday party packages are, but its probably worth checking out if you have kids."}
{"text":"Bad experience. The go karts don't run well. The staff is very unpleasant. They cuss and yell at customers (including children)  if they accidentally bump into the wall or another go kart. This place should be shut down."}
{"text":"My first time here, total lack of information about what to do, we were told it would be a hour wait, I didn't have a problem with that, after two hours of waiting, I asked for a refund and was told I could get some vouchers for another time, not acceptable, demanded a refund and got it, not even a \"sorry for your inconvenience\" ... Totally rude and no customer service at all. I will never come back here again. A total disappointment."}
{"text":"For the second time now, I've brought my son here only to find out that they are not open. I bought a Living Social deal that was valid Saturday from 10am - 1pm... Nothing online says they're closed, the store hours on the door say they should be open, but nope, just a bunch of black plastic in the window. We'll go try K1..."}
{"text":"Wow this place is run horribly. Wish I looked up this place before going. There is a reason this has a 1.5 star rating. Run by people who have NO CLUE what they are doing. Waited 2hrs before my 1st race and there was barely anyone there. Long time in between races. You can tell no one here cares and is just wanting to collect their $6hr at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Had a great time. Carts were really fast and the races seemed really long. The staff was nice. It seems a bit unorganized at time but we were just killing sometime and didn't mind. Had a fun relaxing time drifting and getting beat in the race by my wife. Still fun thought."}
{"text":"Can't figure out why some people don't like this place. Staff was very attentive and pleasant to deal with. Track and cars were in good shape. Give this place a chance, there's a lot to do here."}
{"text":"Front staff people were inexperienced and incredibly slow. We used a Groupon and apparently this throws a wrench in the computer system. Fun track overall. Decent for a quick afternoon excursion."}
{"text":"Pure chaos.   Front counter staff struggled with the computer systems that did not allow more than one transaction at a time. Families with multiple people racing have to be processed individually.   People seem to be selected for races at the whim of the track attendants. Kids races run in the same carts, but at a slower speed.    Condiments at \"Your Behind BBQ\" are stored in room temp water that was likely ice at some point earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Bad experience. Did the groupon for the haunted house and go karting. Haunted house = great. Would recommend. Short but worth it! However, I wish it was in a different location. The staff here are less than accommodating, the computer kept freezing when I tried to put in my information. Spent 20 minutes RIGHT in front of the staff trying to get the computer to work and not one staff member asked if we needed help. Next, our race was scheduled (without asking) for FIVE minutes before the haunted house so that had to get changed. Then (again without asking) our race time was scheduled for ten minutes after the house - STILL not enough time so once that was over we had to get the race time changed AGAIN. Once we finally were in the go kart was a good 15 minutes before we actually get started because one kart was malfunctioning.  Finally, the karts in themselves really just suck. The steering is horrid and mine kept randomly slowing down to practically stopped even when the pedal was floored. Had it not been for the haunted house, I would've been livid spending my money here. RARELY do I take the time to leave a Yelp review but I had to on this. Don't waste your money until management does some major changes."}
{"text":"My brother and I took our kids and nieces and nephews (11 in total) here on a recent Saturday night and we had a great time.  The staff was very friendly and they worked hard to get us on the track as soon as possible. The cars were plenty fast, and they took much skill to maneuver for the fastest time.  We all raced twice and had a lot of fun.  I would love to return."}
{"text":"The kart racing area is pretty generic.  Just a plain warehouse.  My kids love the rc race track.  Its huge!  The guys that run Hobbytown are super helpful & we have had tons of help with our kids rc cars from there.  They have an area on the 2nd story where you can look out over the track while you are racing.  They also have tons of space to work on your vehicles with plugs, chairs, etc."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place isn't more crowded. We went here for the Jack and Jill Haunted Hill and it was great. We went to the bar afterwards. The drinks were reasonably priced and there was a DJ on the stage. Seems like a nice place to chill."}
{"text":"Purchased 2 adult and 1 child (5-13) voucher online for 2 kart races and 1 RC each, via Living Social. We show up at 1pm on a Sunday (voucher says Sunday-Thursday with no time stipulations).  We proceed to fine out that the child must be 54\", now I don't know about you, but I don't know many 5 or 6 year olds that are that tall. I asked if he could at least run the RC cars, and we were informed that Sunday was a \"race\" day and we couldn't even do those. Nowhere in the details or fine print did it reference any race days. We turned around and walked right out with our 6 year old in tears.   This whole thing was a prime example of bait and switch and I will be sending a refund request to Living Social and filing a complaint. Businesses like this won't be around long, and rightfully so."}
{"text":"I took my son for his birthday. I loved how attentive the staff was  to the boys. They gave them good tips to improve their scores, and ensured they were segregated from faster drivers. Thank you very much for ensuring they had a great experience."}
{"text":"This place absolutely SUCKS. They have 11 carts total. Most are broken and they are operating 5 carts at a time. Very disorganized. Bought 2 races and have been waiting 2 hrs as of right now. Wasting our afternoon here! Go some place else or don't waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 2.5 stars if I could, but not quite 3 stars.  As everyone mentioned before me the staff consist of mostly teenage kids who have poor customer service and lack of organization.  We were misinformed by the front desk about pricing, and track related questions....The girl would rather answer questions with I don't know instead of asking someone who did know...The track martials have no order for which the races occur....basically if you wait the entire time by the gate you get to race....otherwise you missed the race....No PA system. The carts drove fairly well for being homemade, but they were very uncomfortable...Hard plastic shell that digs into your thighs...no neck support from the helmet or frame of the go kart.  My kart had restraints that were seriously frayed and looked about ready to give.  The barriers were bolted to the ground, and also ran through fixed metal poles....I feel sorry for anyone who runs into them at 45 mph....no give!!  Saw a kids visor completely detach and fly about 10 feet after colliding with a wall. Safety and organization are two things you won't find at Phoenix Indoor Karting....They are relatively new....Hopefully they take this review as constructive criticism and make the adjustments needed....It does have potential to be better."}
{"text":"I race at this place on their RC Track, and it is awesome!  Lots of cool people work here.  I'm a little bummed that there are so many negative reviews for the Kart side of things.  They are new to Kart racing, and my guess is, that by now, they've worked out all the kinks and it is as much fun to race Karts, as RC Cars now."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Hobby Town and we excited to see their new location! Love the staff at Hobby Town, and love the new track, and set up! We can hang out all day, race, watch, and race again.  Really enjoyed the helpful staff at Phx Indoor Karting. We have raced here twice, and although it is less frills than similar businesses on the east side of town, my boys had a blast on the course."}
{"text":"Came in as a family of 4 for 2 races which is equivalent to $111.93 (we had a coupon and one of us is a child). Fairly normal prices since I have been to 3 other indoor kart races in the valley. I went on a race with my child, than one with the older people in our party. They grouped us with 4 other people who were very aggressive and kept bumping me. One hit me so hard I have bruises all over my clavicles and damaged the kart in the amount of $700 (as per one of the gentleman, presumably the owner?). After only 2 laps and a damaged-beyond-driving kart they pulled me and allowed everyone else to complete the race. The same gentleman/owner brought me a soda so I could have something cold to put on my neck and asked if I was ok. After the race was complete my husband asked if we could be reimbursed for the race because I didn't get to drive for very long. He remarked that the damage was $700 and I should know how to brake!  I then told him I was hit from behind on the right. A simple 2 for 1 coupon (which my husband got from a company trip here) would have been sufficient. I'm not sure how long this company will be in business with such terrible customer service."}
{"text":"The Staff was great, the cart, not so much.    If you're interested in a competitive race it would be difficult as their is no consistency in the carts.    This place has a chance but the carts have to be put to the front of the list."}
{"text":"Worse place with bad manager he is not professional at all bad customer service at the front desk.. They hire young kids that don't know how to talk to customers ... It's not worth half star even I had no choice to add a star because I need to write this review... I'm knew at yelp and I don't know how to skip the stars...  Now it's 3 pm when we walked into this place with my two daughters.. 9 and 7 and a drunk young make came and start harassing us I asked for the manager and he came acting worse than the drunk guy.. Please people with kids watch for this place and be careful..if any one knows the owner of this place Plz post the number here because they won't give it to me"}
{"text":"Hey owners...  1. Do a little rehab on the cars. They are all beat to death. 2. Answer your phones during business hours. Not just send every call to VM.  This place is kinda ghetto. The location, the equipment, the facility... all of it."}
