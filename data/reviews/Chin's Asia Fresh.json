{"text":"The food was alright, the service was alright, the portion size was generous, the prices was alright. 3 stars for a decent place to grab food if you're in a hurry, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Wow.  Chin's is getting some pretty lousy reviews.    I happen to like it a lot here, and after about three years, it's the only place on state street that I consistently enjoy eating at.  I only order the terayki udon noodles.  I just think the place is great.  Fast food noodle bowls, consistent quality, pretty clean and fresh, tasty, and pretty darn cheap at 6 dollars for a very filling portion.  Sure, it's a little bland, but not nearly as bland as I'd expect.  Besides, I douse everything in mustard and chili sauce."}
{"text":"I have been searching for great asian noodles near my office for weeks and I think I've finally found my go to! I ordered the Firecracker Noodles which are thick udon noodles in a spicy chili sauce. There was plenty of sauce which is fantastic and the carrots are cut in thin, round slices. It was spicy and delicious and so so gooooooood!"}
{"text":"I wasn't that impressed. I was slightly buzzed and starving and didn't feel satisfied after my meal. I ordered two pot stickers and an order of chicken with vegetables with white rice and paid $10. The pot stickers were slightly cooler than room temp and tasted like packaged microwaved items. The stir fry had barely any chicken and too much cabbage (I think it was cabbage). The burnt taste throughout wasn't appreciate either. I'd give the service a 4/10. She seemed pretty unfriendly and almost bothered we were taking her time up to take our order and ring us out. For the price and quality/taste I doubt I'll be back again. New to the area and way too much competition/places to try in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"For what it is, a fast food Americanized Oriental restaurant, it's not overly bad, as long as you don't order shrimp.  Service: I've never had a problem here. While not always the most outgoing service, they are friendly. My order is always ready in a decent amount of time. I've never dined in, so I won't comment on atmosphere.  Their menu and nutritional info is easily accessed on line.   For the most part, I've had OK experiences with the food selections. I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special.   However, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking.   I pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite. I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies, but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous, that didn't go well. So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch.   Lesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs.  **** I thought eventually I'd go back, but I haven't been since then. We had some of their food catered in for work, it was overcooked, rubbery, and chewy. yeah, next time I'll get my own lunch."}
{"text":"I had the pad Thai with tofu. I barely ate any. Not very tasty. Waste of money. Service was good. Food was quick. Atmosphere is fine. Likely won't come back given the choice."}
{"text":"We love Asia Fresh. bourbon chicken with veg fried rice-perfect. Take away done quickly. service great. Great price."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular places.  It's pretty unique and eclectic (as another reviewer said) but everything is still recognizable.  Their appetizers and salads are very good.  Their quasi-make your own stir fries are the reason to come here.  They are awesome!!!  You select which meat you want, the type of rice, and the sauce.  All their sauces are fantastic.  The Peking sauce is the best.  It's no longer on the menu but if you ask, they'll use it.  You then get your meat stir fried with a selection veggies and the sauce.  Rice on the side.  The meat is clean and lean and the veggies are fresh.  I've never had a bad stir fry.  Their noodle dishes are very good also.  The kids dishes (except the mac 'n cheese) are fantastic and they're big enough to be an adult lunch.  The mac 'n cheese doesn't belong in an asian place and isn't that great.  Cons: Stay away from their \"classic\" dishes.  They are just not that good.  Their regular fried rice as well as their ten-ingredient fried rice (which one of my friends swears by) are both bland and very, very lame.  We tried to find the ten ingredients and couldn't even if we counted the rice.  The other dishes, like sesame chicken, are OK but nothing spectacular.  Soups are also blah.  Another Con:  If you come here often enough (like I do because I love this place), you know which veggies go with which entree.  You can order items specially made.  I usually order no peppers because I'm mildly allergic to them.  Your chances of getting the item your way are about 30% if it's quiet and 10% during the lunch rush.  Very annoying.  The veggies are all cut big, though, so it's fairly easy to pick out unwanted things.    Pros:  Besides everything else I already mentioned...friendly people, quick service considering they make it to order, clean restaurant, really nice atmosphere, and...wait for it...FRESH fortune cookies.  If you order a kids meal, you get a chocolate dipped fortune cookie."}
{"text":"Come for lunch while window/regular shopping on State St.  Crossing the street from Art Gecko to grab a bite as I didn't feel like cooking at home I get an order of spring rolls, chicken teriyaki and a juice.  It's Simple. It's Amer-\"asian\" food.  We all know it's not authentic.  You're not crossing the Great Wall after battle for a great meal.  It's a good filling meal when you've been walking around for a couple hours and want to sit inside (upstairs when available/open) and chow down with a great view of State St."}
{"text":"I don't mind a place that serves Americanized Chinese food, but Chin's Asia Fresh scares me. The awning is pretentious enough as is with the Chinese characters and I'll forgive the awful pun catchphrase, but I won't forgive the food.  I'm going in there and I order brocolli with chicken and I get overcooked rice with this brown sauce that tastes like someone poured 10 cups of sugar. The brocolli is either raw or just severely undercooked. Now, I understand that Americanized Chinese food has the whole ketchup and sugar thing going on, but seriously, that place had a sauce that had the consistency of and tasted like maple syrup. On top of that, the food was overpriced -- $7 for a bowl of food with portions smaller than a coke can. A severe rip off!  I really don't understand the appeal of this place, but whatever floats anyone's boat. If you're seriously digging the whole Americanized Chinese food thing, you're better off heading to Asian Kitchen or A8 instead; at least the food is properly cooked and the prices are more reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today for lunch. Food is delicious-- what you would expect as far as quantity and quality for a fast casual Asian place. My noodles were actually really good-- creamy sauce and not greasy like a lot of Asian noodles are.   But as much as I liked the food, this place needs a serious remodel. Everything is shabby and kind of sad. Floors are dingy, tabletops peeling, walls are dirty and banged up. Just really tired looking.   Their soda machine was also really dirty. I used to work in food service and we had to wipe down the soda machine every night at closing. This one looks like it hasn't been cleaned in-- no exaggeration-- months.   I will eat here again, but I will get takeout and a bottled drink, nothing from the fountain."}
{"text":"We come here a lot and the food is never consistent. Sometimes it's really salty. Other times it's too spicy or not spicy enough. There must be several different cooks because the sauce is never the same either. We still like the adventure of what we may get today. Stop for quick bite on the way home. If you tried it and didn't like it you may want to try again, you may be surprised at how much better or different the next time may be.   The servers here are friendly enough but some times they difficult to read. Place is not always clean but it's clean enough. I don't like the fact that some of the tables are falling apart but there is always customers here so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"This place is similar to Noodles & Co. but far worse and they only serve asian dishes and bland ones at that.  My food wasn't bad per se but it wasn't that good either.  The bbq chicken vietnamese spring rolls were practically tasteless and my stir fry was just as boring.  Service was nice enough though."}
{"text":"Chins definitely give you your money's worth.  I ordered a pad Thai, spring rolls, and cream cheese puffs for under 15 dollars.  They give you enough pad Thai for 2 meals, and for 6 dollars that's definitely worth it.  I didn't think it was super authentic, but everything was tasty. I normally don't order anything like cream cheese puffs because there's never enough filling, but chins did a good job of providing enough filling and not too much of the outside part.  The spring rolls were really filling but fell apart really easily."}
{"text":"We have been searching for a good Chinese restaurant that won't break the bank. We found it! Chin's is amazing! 3 of us went out to eat and all got a different dish and upgraded to the vegetable rice. Add 3 drinks and 6 cream cheese wontons and our bill was $33. The food was spectacular!"}
{"text":"I know it's American Chinese food, so I am prepared for what I'm going to have. I ordered sweet and sour chicken, this is the worst Chinese food I ever have during my 4 year stay in US. Panda is doing better then this. No sweet, no sour. It's beyond my words. Good luck, guys."}
{"text":"Seems to have gone downhill -- I was there in 2010 and had a decent cashew chicken, but this last time was bad. The rice was blander than minute rice I make at home (and I'm very bad at making rice!). Service was rough and slow for the product. The chicken was OK but no better than cafeteria or Asian restaurants that don't claim to be \"fresh\". Very disappointing, the concept could be an Eastern version of Noodles and Company."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to get a mix between sit down and fast food type of chinese food! They take your order and then make your food fresh and you have it in no time. I've had their version of general tso's chicken and both times it was great. The chicken is crispy and just perfect the way they do it. I've also had their spring roles here as well and they are amazing too. Looking forward to coming here more and trying more of the menu! I love that they also give you a big cup for water!"}
{"text":"I love Chins! Their sesame chicken in the best. Their service is great, never long lines, clean, and the food comes out fast! Only downside is it is a bit on the higher price side for fast food but you get a lot and I usually bring half home. Chins is my favorite Asian restaurant on the west side."}
{"text":"I always get the lemon chicken and it's delicious! Nice light batter and very crispy with a good amount of sauce. The potstickers are also very good."}
{"text":"Sometimes I come here and am impressed, and other times I am not. Last night was one of those times that I was not impressed with my meal. Maybe it was the fact that we came in at 830pm - half an hour before they close - to grab dinner to go. We both ordered the lemon chicken, which was ready in less than 5 minutes. I am all about speedy service, however, with being THAT quick, I thought either the chicken wouldn't be cooked completely OR it was already made and then just re-heated. It was FOR SURE stuck in a microwave and served. Chewy, dry and minimal flavor. The gentleman who took our order seemed slightly annoyed that we were there. I suppose I get that, being so close to closing time? Either way, not great customer service. Most likely will not return."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken.  It didn't taste like pad thai... I think it was missing the tamarind juice that gives it its tanginess.  The chicken tasted like it was previously cooked or just not good quality chicken.  The noodles were just drenched in soy sauce or something like it.  Fresh veggies were, however, the only thing pleasant about the big bowl of noodles."}
{"text":"8 years ago this place would've gotten 5stars and then some, but oh how the mighty have fallen.  Gone are the pretty boxes, the fresh interior, the ever-refreshing menu, the custom-printed hilarious fortune cookies. And here to stay are boring take-out boxes, a worn restaurant with a many-times-amended menu, and no more fun cookies.  I still love Chin's. Nearly every time I've come back to the US in the past few years I've made a point of getting some 10 Ingredient Fried Rice and Cream Cheese Puffs for lunch one day. But it all used to be a lot better. Still. It's tasty and the people there are always nice. Chin up, Chin's!"}
{"text":"Much like it's former State Street counterpart, this place used to be awesome. The food is still good, but it's not so fast anymore and the ingredients seem to be a bit skimpy. My 10 Ingredient Fried Rice had about 4 shrimp. Lame. Still - it's all delicious. But I never used to have to wait 15 minutes and it all-around used to be shinier."}
{"text":"The one on state street closed.  I was very disappointed.  If you like peanut sauces or pad thai, the Thai Peanut Lo Mien, add chicken, is awesome. I eat this all the time.  I have tried my friends lemon chicken which was also very good."}
{"text":"I don't where to start. First off, this is a chinese fusion fast food place so any comments that said it is not authentic chinese is accurate but irrelevant. I had the stif fry dish of tofu and vegetable with Shanghai sesame sauce with brown rice. I said with and not over because that is how it was served. The portion was generous & the vege was definitely fresh. So fresh, the carrots were still hard. The pea pods were done right, still has a crunch and no \"green\" taste to it. The sauce has 2 chiils next to it but it is hardly spicy. More sweet than spicy. So in terms of freshness, I say Chin's Asia Fresh lived up to its name.   In terms of how good the dish is, there are lots to improve.   1) The tofu used is probably the wrong type. I would have used a softer tofu and flash fried to burn the outside. Keeping the tofu soft will complement the crunchy vege better.  2) the carrots could have been sliced long like the rest of the vege instead of just round discs. If could also be better it was cooked a rat longer or parboiled before frying.  3) ideal vege for the tofu would be black mushrooms or black fungus in place of the carrots and keep everything else.  4) the sauce is not sticking or coating the vegetables and so a thickener would be great.  5) I would serve the stir fry over the rice instead of on the side to make tge presentation nicer."}
{"text":"This was one of the only Chinese, or faux-chinese, restaurants I found in Madison where I could have a great meal and afterwards not feel like the MSG was going to end me. The food is definitely fresh, or far, far fresher than most other Chinese places - yummy buffet, anyone?  I understand why other reviewers would dislike it. It's Americanized, and they don't pretend to be otherwise - get over it!  This place is great for students. The portions are solid, though going daily would be difficult on the wallet.   I LOVE the sesame chicken, though it's a bit spicy for my tastes.  I want it to come to Chicago so badly, but the competition might stave it for now."}
{"text":"My go to take out place. Always consistent. Always good. I recommend the Mongolian beef stir fry and spring rolls."}
{"text":"I like that I can add items to a base entree to make it my own.  I love the Thai peanut lo mein.  the noodles were easy to eat (they were cut shorter)."}
{"text":"I'm giving Chin's the A-OK rating because it is just that.  It wasn't great, and it wasn't terrible.  I had some kind of tofu vegetable noodle dish though I can't remember exactly which one.  The noodles I had were well flavored with a good consistency.  The vegetables were OK.  A-OK?  Not entirely, as some of them I found downright inedible.  I don't know if they weren't cooked long enough or if it was simply a part of the of the vegetable that shouldn't be consumed.  Like a tough, fibrous stalk.  They violated my rule about food, which is that if I can't chew it I don't eat it.  On the other hand it was pretty cheap and pretty fast.  Sure it could have been better, but at that price point it's hard to be outraged."}
{"text":"After going to the Chin's on State St. I was pretty sure I'd never go to Chin's again. But this location is close to my work and a coworker invited me. Perhaps I am also weak?  Anyway I was pleasantly surprised to find that, for whatever reason, the food here seemed much better. It could maybe be argued that the noodles are a little heavy on the sauce, but everything else seemed fine. The tofu and veggies are well prepared and chewable (not the case on State St!) and really that's all I need.  In addition the staff is always pleasant and the food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"Not so freshly made!  We asked if they could do just a veggie asian wrap and said no rudely then told us  that no it impossible as it comes with chicken only so I asked well can't we just get the lettuce and stir fried veggies that's all we want he said I'll ask the cook yelled back at cook and she said no ??? Fresh chin not so fresh !!!! So we left never going back first and last!"}
{"text":"Really solid Chinese food.  Have had Generals chicken and Orange chicken and both were very good.  Always clean and consistent. Wish they had a true Crab Rangoon then it would be perfect."}
{"text":"The food here is quite good actually. Not 5 star restaurant quality but for the price and service, it's decent. The staff was friendly and I didn't wait long in line. The teriyaki chicken and cream puffs are my favorites and even though the chocolate covered fortune cookie was meant for little kids, I still have the balls to ask for one lol. Overall, not a bad choice at all.  Oh and I'll say it straight off the bat, this place is not authentic asian food. But for what it is (which is pan asian fast food), it did not disappoint me."}
{"text":"This is a classic and I honestly hope it continues to thrive. Their flavors are unique and refreshing, nothing like typical Chinese food. Their sesame chicken with white rice is the best, and I love the tangy sweet taste of their cream cheese puffs. It's been very sad to see the number of Chin's dwindle, and I go to this one every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The employees are always so pleasant and helpful! Excellent food, very clean establishment. It's hard not to leave with a smile on your face!"}
{"text":"Husband and I love this place and have never been let down! Food is always delicious, tastes fresh, and is served hot-never disappoints! The employees have always been nice and polite, so no complaints there either. Our favorite go-to in Madison!"}
{"text":"I need to be gluten free. I really wanted to like this place since they can make GF Asian cuisine. Sadly, I've always gotten sick when giving them a chance. I suggest staying away if you need to be g free."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Best Asian food around. Great atmosphere and the customer service is top notch. A must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"On my first time, I asked for the Ten Ingredient Fried Rice. The food was so dried and tasted like burned food. I gave a second chance and went for a second visit. This time I asked for Sweet and Sour chicken to go. It is supposed to have carrots and pineapples, but I just got ONE little teeny-tiny piece of each. When I arrived at home, the sweet and sour souce had dried. So I just ate a dried chicken with rice."}
{"text":"Yelped this place while in Madison for business.  Ordered the chicken Szechuan stir fry and the 3 wing (Hunan) app.    Now let me preface this review with the fact that I am from flushing queens and that means I know Chinese food!  The food here was surprisingly fresh  the veggies were crisp and tasty. They didnt drown the food in sauce and The rice was good too. I didn't expect the food to be as good as it was because I didn't think a franchise could deliver good tasting Chinese cuisine. They did a good job.  I have definitely had better stir fry  but this spot came through with a good dish. I would go back if I find myself in this hood again. I'd recommend to give it a try"}
{"text":"Good place to stop when you're really hungry.  More food than its next door neighbor chipotle for the same price.  Friendly staff and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"We tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away. On their menu it says $15 minimum. We called to place the order and we were told today it's a $75 minimum. We found that insane so never ordered."}
{"text":"I like Chin's.  It's fresh-tasting with good, veggie-filled vegetarian options in a city where good Chinese food is hard to find.  It's also a pretty comfy place to meet friends for a cheap lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Gross. I thought this place was semi-decent years ago. Decided to try it again. Agree with other reviewer, 'charbroiling' adds flavor and then you can \"enjoy\" that flavor over and over again all afternoon. Ick!  I was mid-meal when I looked up to closer examine the soy sauce bottle I was using. It was caked with what appeared to be years of crud both around the spout and the cap. I think they fill but never wipe or sanitize the bottles. Many of the dining room tables have peeling tops. If you serve good food in a clean place, you should be able to afford the occasional replacement table or repair.   I brought the bottle to the manager's attention upon leaving and he looked at me like I was a lunatic and could not see the scunge on the bottle.  Gross gross gross!"}
{"text":"Eclectic (but down-to-earth), Upbeat, Friendly, Inexpensive, Near-healthy (see menu), Kid-friendly, Fast, Clean, Variety.  What more could one ask for?"}
{"text":"I think the Chin's story is of the franchise that couldn't remain consistent in it's food prep.  Hubs and I used to live at the Chin's on State St.  LIVED there our entire undergrad years due to our hole in the wall efficiency apt. being directly across the street from Chin's, and the fact that they served healthy, fresh, fast food with rice.  This was probably the only place doing that back then.  The chicken and veggie teriyaki was always my default, as the Szechuan chicken was for hubs -  mine was chock full with crisp pea pods, carrots, red and green cabbage, scallion, and light teriyaki sauce.  We also loved the Thai peanut lo mein.  We were always happy it was actually spicy and the sauce used to coat the noodles was just genuinely good.    We moved to Milwaukee after our rendezvous with the campus life and during our first weeks getting to know the city we saw there was a Chin's on Oakland Ave and got excited.  Yet eating there was like an entirely different experience.  The food was horrible!! The noodles were overcooked, the peanut sauce used in the peanut lo mein was like an entirely different recipe - the Szechuan was not spiced well at all and my teriyaki no longer had the delicate flavor and the crisp vegetables I so appreciated.  We tried again just to make sure, and it was the same story.  We had conversations walking out of there questioning if Chin's changed it's recipes.  A couple months later they closed down. I think a Five Guys now takes it's place on Oakland.    Not long afterward the State St. location went the same way.  Some karaoke spot stands there now and in my bitterness at seeing Chin's go I've refused to check out what they have to offer in it's place.    Fast forward five years and somehow we'd found ourselves back on campus for varying reasons, with an ache for Chin's as soon as we touched foot on good ol' State.  Finding out there was still a Chin's in Madison was a spectacular find for us.  Having eaten at this location in Middleton now multiple times in the past couple years I can safely say I remain a fan.    People here have a lot of complaints and I'm feeling quite protective.  This is my spot! This place is not \"gross,\" it's not dirty, the service has always been absolutely fine, and I'm not reducing stars for them being who they are: NOT AUTHENTIC!    I appreciate Chin's as I appreciate Noodles N' Company and Chipotle.  It's fast casual food that won't bust your gut if you're into the healthier side of things and look for those options at restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm confused why anyone would choose to go here.   To be clear, my expectations were that it would be an all Asian version of Noodles & Co.  Cheap, decent, fresh food.   Cheap - yep Decent - no Fresh - maybe at one point I ordered the Thai curry noodles.  Not impressed.  I've never tasted something that claimed to be curry with so little flavor.  My vegetables were obviously charred and they still sent me the dish.  Yuck.  My boyfriend ordered the teriyaki udon, and the noodles were too skinny to be udon with the same flavor issues.  Not even the chili garlic sauce did much to it.   Chin's - good concept, but a waste of money even at $6."}
{"text":"So much food for the price!!! I visit Chins for lunch periodically and have always had a great experience. Food comes out fresh and hot, and the dining area is clean and nicely decorated. Parking can be a hassle but it's like that for every business in that strip. I once had some chicken that was way too crispy( over fried) but the replaced it with a fresh plate and I was very satisfied. Thanks Chins for having a nice staff as well! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"pad thai = chow mein, the chicken dishes are bland.  If you're going to get something get the stir fries."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to Sweet and Sour Chicken. I was very disappointed. It was terrible. It came so dry that I had to ask for more sauce and the chicken was dry and tough. Very little taste and low quality ingredients. I will not return."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Quick to bring out but found it not hot and conflicting flavors on one dish and zero on the other. Save your calories for another place..."}
{"text":"Stopped at Chin's with my sister-in-law while in town for her wedding. We were out running errands, and wanted to pick up a quick lunch to bring back to the house. Stopped in Chin's which is a fast casual restaurant, and we were in and out in probably 15 minutes.  There's a menu on the wall, or you can pick up a paper menu to see the different items. Unfortunately, they didn't have a gluten free menu, but I went on line to find out the dishes and sauces that were gluten free.  I had the chicken and vegetable stir fry with coconut curry sauce. Yum! We took it to go, but buy did it hit the spot. It was affordable too! Probably not as cheap as your favorite college Chinese spot, but it's certainly a good quality for the price!'  I did ask them to spice my dish up since it was only one heat sign, but she said it was already spicy. I didn't think that the dish was spicy at all, but tasty!"}
{"text":"I was in the area.  I was about to go to Pho Nam but decided to try Chins.   My first impression was that this was a lot like Noodles and company with a Chinese decor.  It fell short in ambiance and flavor for me. I ordered the Thai Noodles. Thai Noodles: wide Asian noodles with bok choy, red onions, pea pods, and water chestnuts in coconut curry with Thai seasonings, garnished with lime, red pepper, and sprouts. I didn't feel like this had a lot of flavor.  It was barely coconut curry and actually had a flavor that was different from anything I have ever had before.   The vegetable were fresh and the portion was good. My overall experience was so so but I still ended up having a good time because I was able to witness an exchange between some people that was something like a scene out of the movie Slacker by Linklater.   What happened is a person came in and recognized an old classmate.  They were friendly and greeted the other person with a hearty, \"Hey! How have you been.\"  The other person didn't recognize them.  He introduced himself and then they knew who he was but they were completely distant and uninterested.  It was awkward.  A true cringe moment.  Some people can be so cold and insensitive.  It went on for about 5 minutes and really made my stop there interesting.  There were a lot of people here from what it looked like they were on lunch from nearby businesses."}
{"text":"Solid asian food.  Not super fancy. Most entrees are around 7.50-8 dollars you will be full after they give you lots of food.  Very nice employees too"}
{"text":"The food was decent.  But yet again, the staff managed to screw my order up and ended up charging me more then what I should of payed for."}
{"text":"Okay, sorry guys..but I was NOT impressed. Just happened to be in the neighborhood...so I decided to go to Chin's because I could sit outside. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the fried rice. The meat in the wraps was sub-standard and reminded me of dog food. The sauce was pretty much the only good part. The fried rice was described to have veggies and shrimp and crab...when it came out, it was so obviously KRAB. Ugh. I won't be wasting my money again."}
{"text":"There is only one reason to bother coming to Chin's: the cream cheese puffs.  If you get anything else, you're wasting your money. I'm not saying this because \"It's not authentic Asian!\"--I'm saying this because the flavors are generally bland, the food is generally overcooked (or has been every time I've been here), and the food tastes real bland and repetitive after the third bite.  Otherwise, as others have mentioned, you can get better American-Chinese elsewhere and for cheaper. But if you want the real-deal kind of Asian food, Fugu is the one. Normally, I wouldn't suggest going to other places, but Chin's is such a rip-off compared to other places.  However, I will say this: Chin's has a very neat ambiance and the setting itself is much nicer than any of the other Asian food places on or near State St."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time ... Ordered sesame chicken which apparently is very spicy though the cashier (after first delivering the wrong food) never mentioned it.  I went up to tell them I wasn't happy that my mouth was burning because it was so spicy and he said okay that will be $7.50 for another order without the sauce.  I stated that he should tell people that it is spicy and he said \"I thought you read the sign.\"  I decided it was time to leave ... I wasn't paying for a meal twice and getting attitude from this guy. Terrible customer service!!"}
{"text":"Good Asian food at an unbeatable price! Their Chicken Pad Thai is second to none, with heaping portions and great glass noodles. My fiance ordered the Sichuan Chicken Stir Fry and couldn't find a single thing she didn't like about it! Service was quick and friendly. Definitely making this place a regular visit"}
{"text":"In my twenties I enjoyed Chin's for its super cheap prices and convenient locations to my homes on campus and the west side. In the early twenty-teens quality started to suffer, so I stopped going. On a recent trip to the west side I needed a quick and cheap meal and decided to give them another spin.   I opted for my go-to order: the Smiling Lotus Plate off the kids menu. What used to be a takeout container packed full of rice and a full chicken breast is now a small scoop and maybe half a piece of chicken. The cream cheese puffs are as they were, but they've done away with the chocolate-dipped fortune cookie and now give styrofoam coffee cups instead of a regular soda cup. The price has gone up a bit to $4.75 + tax from $4.   The food itself was fine, not a bad deal for $5, and a reasonable amount of food for a kid. However, the days of their SLP being a great steal for an adult are over, so for me it's merely a-ok to meh. The quality of my meal doesn't inspire me to pony up for the cost of getting a full entree and a side of puffs off the regular menu."}
{"text":"Reuirements for a lunch spot aren't complex or unreasonable, yet Chin's doesn't do well... Soda machine is mostly water every few visits, \"ready in 5 minutes\" really means \"ready in 15 minutes\", food quality is great only 10% of visits with mostly \"meh\" and sometimes downright terrible... Essentially, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"My husband and I went out here on our date night. Walking through the door we instantly thought Noodles and Co. due to the menu layout on the wall. It being our first time here we made it through the typical awkward stage of processing the scene to figure out how to order and the drink situation.(they have a soda fountain that is hard to see to the left)   My husband was very satisfied with the place but I'm still a little reserved. I got the stirfry which was okay. I think the crunchy vegetables were the best. The stir fry sauce was a little bland for my liking. As usual my husband shared with me a piece of his sesame chicken and I instantly got jealous. I wanted his plate. LOL For two people w drinks two appetizers (2 spring rolls, 3 cream cheese puffs) plus each upgrading to 10 ingredient fried rice $1.75 it to $27 and change. We had a living social coupon for $20 my husband still wants to come back but if I do I'm ordering off the classic menu as he did. Live and learn I guess. :) A plus, they have an outside patio."}
{"text":"A fast-casual spin-off of a Minnesota-based, fast-food Chinese-American chain that likewise serves nothing special, Chin's gets one star for being the only Asian-American place I know of in Dane County that serves fried cream cheese wontons without crabmeat. I require a side dish of epinephrine if I eat crab, so I appreciate this omission. Now that I have established that I go here just for the cream cheese puffs, it should be clear that I'm far from an expert on Asian food. So take the rest of my review with a grain of salt; there should be plenty to spare in your entree.   I used to think this place was ok -- it still has plenty of variety, a very friendly staff, good chili-garlic sauce, decent potstickers, above-average lettuce wraps, no grisly or fatty pieces of meat -- but lately the preparation has been sloppy and the presentation just as bad. I suspect the quality of the ingredients has come down a notch.   After cream cheese wontons, Pad Thai is one of my favorite Asian entrees. My last order looked like Goldilocks's porridge in the \"Three Little Bears\" Golden Book I had as a kid. Dull gray, soupy, greasy, salty and watery, yet somehow sticky. The chopped peanuts added no crunch at all, which is too bad because other than the chicken pieces I picked through the mess to find, I was hoping to find something else edible. Epic fail on this entree.   On my next visit, I ordered the Firecracker noodles with chicken, as a side to my beloved wontons. Slight improvement from last time but still salty as the Dead Sea and enough grease to de-squeak every door hinge on the west side. The bag was so heavy I skipped my biceps workout for a week. The red peppers had no life left. Again, I hunted and pecked for the chicken, which is consistently decent-quality, well-prepared white meat. My wife's veggie fried rice would have been ok -- they ease up on the salt and Valvoline for this entree -- but the vegetables were overcooked and charred in places. Fresh veggies should present as a bright spectrum of colors -- orange from the carrots, bright green from the scallions, broccoli and pea pods, yellow from the corncobettes. Instead, however, they were the same brown color as the fried rice.   My last fortune cookie said I'll probably return to Chin's. It's on the way home from work, the food comes out fast and I can't resist those damn cream cheese wontons. Maybe I'll throw in some potstickers or wraps and call it dinner."}
{"text":"Asian fare is all about the sauces and the fresh veggies and meat in my opinion. Chin's fails in all three areas. I guess I learned my first Midwest lesson: when in Wisconsin, eat as the Wisconsinites do!!!"}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before stopping in. Greeted by tall Asian looking kid in a White \"Beast Mode\" T-Shirt with backwards baseball cap. Not very friendly to start. When asked if I could get a \"cold\" bottled drink (instead of the warm bottles at the cashier's stand) he seemed annoyed and said he had to go all the way in back to get it. No one was behind me so not sure of his intentions to let me know he was inconvenienced.  While waiting for my order noticed 3 visibly dirty tables in an empty dining room. T-Shirt kid went through the dining room after bringing my food to me and walked past each dirty table as least once. 30 mins later tables still dirty but now there are 5 sets of patrons eating in the dining area. How embarrassing.  I now notice that the uniform that everyone else is wearing appears to be a black shirt with khakis.  Not very consistent with service or procedures. At least the food was hot when it was brought out. That keeps this from being a 1 star review.  Sorry but this is a perfect example of a manager who doesn't care what's happening in the restaurant and has no control.  Doesn't matter if the food is good, if your restaurant is filthy and the service sucks, I'm sure there are other issues waiting to happen. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with the first Chin's review - I like this place quite a bit.  In fact, whenever I'm back in Madison I usually find myself at Chin's for lunch.  I almost always order the spicy-sweet Sesame Chicken with brown rice and their cream cheese wontons.  I've had other dishes as well, though - all their stir-frys are really tasty.  It's cheap, it's quick (an order & pay at the counter & they bring it to you kind of place), it's good.  Bonus for the building housing the restaurant - an old warehouse-type space with exposed brick and a great upstairs seating section looking out over all the eclectic people wandering down State Street."}
{"text":"Ashley V said it best \"why would anyone choose to go here?\" I am still traveling, and the indignities of the Midwest continue. I didn't think it was cheap. I knew I was not going to get real Chinese food, I knew I was coming in to get a pseudo version of Americanized Chinese food. My first indication that I was not in Peking, was the Hispanic girl struggling to understand my English ordering and the POS system which was also in English. Damn oppressive society.  Anyway, I really should not disparage global initiative the restaurant is embracing. We are all going to be working for Indian companies, as Obama went specifically to India to procure 15 million jobs to alleviate the unemployment crisis in this country. I welcome TATA motors and their cardboard framed cars. I digress.....  Rosa, or whatever her name was, with the help of her friend, Miguel (probably not his name, and he was clearly only working there because it was too cold for his primary profession, that being a jockey) managed to screw up my order twice, overcharged me twice and never apologized. Almost thought I was in Los Angeles again.  The cream cheese puffs were soggy, greasy and about as far from \"puffy\" as one could get. The chicken was white, but it was also fatty and grisly. The Thai spring rolls were not bad flavor but they too were greasy and not very crispy. The fried rice was disgusting, just a greasy mush of dirty looking rice, mushrooms and egg. Finally, the pot stickers, ah the pot stickers, they should have stuck to the pot. The filling was some processed mash of something, while the outside was supposed to have been lightly pan fried, let's emphasize the word \"lightly.\"  This is not very good Asian food. I would suggest that there must be a better choice in Madison. I am sure there are Asians in Madison. I have not seen them, but somewhere in this land must lay a pocket of Asians. There is a university, with a math and an engineering department . There has to be Asians somewhere, I would suggest to find them, and ask them where to eat. I am sure Chin's would not be on their list."}
{"text":"Even though Chin's was relatively inexpensive and decent, I wouldn't go there for good Chinese food. It was the 'noodles and company' of Chinese, very Americanized. It is a good place for college kids, like myself, to go and eat, hang out, but definitely not the best i've ever had."}
{"text":"Remember that Seinfeld episode where Elaine is on a frozen yogurt kick because she thinks that it's really healthy but when her pants get too tight has Kramer run a calorie analysis on it only to discover that there are way more calories in it than she thought? I wish I knew Kramer so he could do the same for the Thai curry noodles I just ate from Chins. The website says there are 251 calories in this thing, but there's no way that's true. Is it? It tasted like at least 550 calories. Maybe I misread the nutritional statement. After all, at one point in my life I was eating at Taco Bell every week believing the bean burrito had 180 calories only to discover many months later that it was really 180 grams and like 400 calories.  But whatever, who cares. It was pretty decent regardless of the # of calories. The veggies were fresh and crisp and though the two little peppers next to it on the menu board made me believe it was going to be spicier than it was, it was fine; about what you'd expect from a fast casual fusion restaurant. The Thai spring roll though, that was disgusting (and 194 calories if you care)."}
{"text":"Fast food Chinese is generally not that exciting, but I must say this place really was quite impressive. Very fresh tasting ingredients with a lot of good flavors, all served hot and with a smile. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I love how fast this place is. It's great  restaurant for people with toddlers. It's so yummy. Love their lemon chicken and pot stickers"}
{"text":"Only thing less disappointing then the food is the staff.   Ordered Chin Wings, Hot & Sour soup and Sesame Chicken to go.. What I get in return is Chin Wings with the wrong stir fry sauce, a cup of hot & sour and lemon chicken.  They charged me for what I ordered, yet they still refused a refund me or to replace my food.. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"We did takeout from here and both thought our dinners were awesome.  We ordered:   - Chicken wings with Sesame Szechuan sauce (you can get them with any stir fry sauce choice) - Hot and sour soup - Thai spring rolls - Sesame chicken - Sweet and sour chicken.   Then we got stuck in rush hour/post blizzard traffic and had a 40 minute commute home.  We were both impressed how well the food held up after that amount of time! The flavor of the wings was good, but they were obviously no longer hot.  Next time we will try those when we dine in.   Everything else had lots of heat and flavor.  The hot and sour soup looked different than any other I have eaten, but it was still good and plenty hot.  I did not detect much sour in it, my only small complaint.  We both felt we had more than enough food for $23, and the quality was great.  We will definitely go back.  I am actually a little shocked at all the bad reviews on this place after our dining experience.  Not sure if they have improved things or we just hit it on a good night.  Service was fast, friendly and accurate...no complaints there."}
{"text":"Great quality-I had the hot & sour soup and it was delicious, with quality ingredients.  My friend had the generals chicken and the same applies-they didn't use dark meat for the chicken and it was lightly breaded.  Will come back for sure."}
