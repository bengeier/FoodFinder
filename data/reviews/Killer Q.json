{"text":"BBQ sundae??  Yes,  please!  Imagine succulent BBQ layered with tasty baked beans,  cole slaw,  a tangy BBQ ranch sauce.  Ask to \"make it killer\"  and that adds pickled onions and peppers.  Guess what?  It's not imaginary,  it's for reals. So delicious.  Portable too.  Find this food truck!"}
{"text":"Finally, Killer Q has a truck!  We have enjoyed their catering many times.  Such delicious barbecue!  You have to try the butter pecan sauce and the Tarheel tamale.   YUM!"}
{"text":"I work at Triple C Brewery and Killer Q was our food truck last Saturday. I had the chicken BBQ Sundae and OMG it was AMAZING!! This thing had everything you could ever want for a BBQ meal in one cup! Beams, check. Slaw (white, my fav), check. Mac n cheese (soo good), check. BBQ (obviously), check. And to top it off, he even puts a tropics umbrella in it!! Really impressed & I hope Killer Q comes back to Triple C EVERY day I work!!"}
