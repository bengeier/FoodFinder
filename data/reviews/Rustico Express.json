{"text":"Very good chicken wraps pastas really good lunch I always come in after the lunch hour and service is fine. I wish it was open later or for dinner take out."}
{"text":"I love to go there and grab a sandwich to go! Service is not super quick (especially on a weekday lunch time period), but the food is good and pricing decent for an industrial park place. The cuttleta sandwich is my preferred choice!"}
{"text":"I've come to Rustico Express a few times as its location is quite convinient for me to grab breakfast/lunch on the go before heading back home (I get to work from home sometimes).  Had a variety of breakfasts and lunch and it's solid. I really like their BLT sandwich.  If you work in the area, dropping by is a must.  Service is friendly and fast. Price is just right."}
{"text":"Good food, prepared fresh, good for quick bite, breakfast or lunch. Wide selection of sandwiches, breakfast menu and weekly lunch menu, the stuff are welcoming and prices are affordable. Its more a bistro / cafe type. Definitely recommend it."}
