{"text":"I would like to enjoy this restaurant because it is within walking distance of my house. But after trying it at least a dozen times over the past few years I have finally had enough.  My wife and I can't remember a single visit that one of our dinners was not cold/warm or we had poor service (and that starts at the top).  My suggestion is to go to choplins just 1/2 mile away or Dresslers in birkdale off exit 25 (3 miles away).    My other suggestion to Altons is put some effort into cooking new dishes and get your plates out of the kitchen onto your customers table instead of setting under lamps!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had an amazing meal for restaurant week. The service and food was excellent. The restaurant smelled wonderful from the moment we got out of the car. The service was excellent and the food was delightful. We had the lobster bisque, peninsula nachos, Caesar salads, bottle of wine, surf-n-turf, lamb, oreo ice cream, and apple cobbler. The food was fresh and tasty. We highly recommend Altons to everyone. The manager was even walking around, checking on tables, and delivering food. We were pleasantly surprised at how awesome our evening was."}
{"text":"Really love this place! My husband says its the best burger around the lake. They also have some very unique and tasty cocktails. I like to go there and sit at the bar area."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night, it was OK, but for the price you can do a lot better.  Both steaks were cooked incorrectly, the seasoning was good, twice baked potato was good, wine prices are decent."}
{"text":"Have lived in LKN for 3 years and been pretty much everywhere. This is our \"go to\" restaurant. For a weeknight sitting in the bar or friends in town visiting on the weekends.  Had all on menu and everything is great. Favorites are prime rib stuffed mushrooms, lobster Bisque, and must have French Dip- (shaved prime rib) YUM!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant where I have had such inconsistent service and food quality. My overall rating is 2 stars as I have averaged my two visits.   VISIT #1:  4 STARS My first visit was great. It was very early on a Saturday night, we strolled in with no reservation, and basically had the place to ourselves. I had the burger, he had the ribs, and we shared the chicken tenders to start. The decor was lovely and upscale, the server was fast, the bill came and we were happy to pay it. Great overall experience.    VISIT #2:   0 STARS Went back for Charlotte Restaurant Week Jan 2014. NIGHTMARE! We made reservations for the Saturday night way in advance and even showed up a little early. We had another couple coming in from out of town and thought it would be a nice place to go with them. NOPE. The place was slammed with people waiting out the door. I think the whole town of Cornelius was there. Our reservation was for 8pm. We got seated at 9:30pm. Not good. And we were seated in this no atmosphere overflow room in the back with two huge groups next to us. He was like \"where are we? Is this still Alton's Kitchen?\"  No server for miles, finally ordered at 10pm. Our guests are now pissed off and this restaurant is ruining our evening. When the dinner finally arrives at almost 11pm, the food is not hot and just mediocre (he got the ribs again and wasn't impressed). The others in our party wanted to order another drink so they could have it with their dinner. NO SERVER FOR MILES AGAIN. So they just sat there, waiting for the server to come as their dinner got cold. She arrived when the rest of us finished dinner and got them a drink so they could eat. It was really uncomfortable and we haven't seen them since. I was embarrassed to have taken them there. Is it my fault for going during Restaurant Week craziness and expecting a decent meal? Or is it Alton's Kitchen's fault for overbooking their restaurant, going over capacity, and not having enough staff? My questions may never be answered, but one this is for sure- I'm never going back and will never recommend this place.    TO ALTON'S KITCHEN: Charlotte Restaurant Week Summer edition is next month. Let this be a lesson on how not to do it. Do not make it a repeat of January and lose more customers."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! Great service, great food and a very homey feel. Everything from the stuffed mushrooms and steaks to the cocktails were delicious! We will definitely be making this a regular place for dinner and date nights"}
{"text":"So I'll start off with saying that being from Texas we drink with our brunch. If we are going out to brunch we are having cocktails that being said my initial impression of Alton's was disappointing because that's what I went expecting. However that was quickly rectified when I discovered you cannot get any alcohol before noon on Sundays. The overall opinion of the food was great. We did hit a few bumps along the way but hey I am willing to forgive just about anything for good food.   The other half got the Prime Rib Hash and I myself got the Braised Lamb. I am sad to say that they do not serve breakfast pastries with your brunch. Could it be another Texas thing I wonder?? Anyway moving on, KP's p.r.h. was delicious and tasty.  When it came out was steaming hot and very aromatic mine however was cold, the egg was hot however the hash cold and I don't mean a little cool I mean cold as in been in the fridge cold... KP said this was due to the fact that I scarred our server when I discovered that I couldn't get a Mimosa. As a very good manager does she stopped by and checked to make sure the food was up to our standards. KP informed her mine was cold and it was sent back (not going to lie I was nervous. Being from the kitchen I know how frustrating it is to have a dish sent back.) However the second was amazing!! The grits had not only great flavor but texture as well. Salt was not an item I required which by the way says volumes. My egg perfectly cook and the hollandaise nice and creamy.   So looking past not getting my Mimosa, the breakfast pastries and my original cold dish (I think I agree with Kendall the kitchen was paying me back for the Mimosa) cause lets face it those are definitely things I can live without it was an overall good dining experience, and I do recommend dining there. We will have to try dinner next."}
{"text":"Tried this one based on the Charlotte Queens Feast and we will definitely be going back. Cocktails were very interesting, always looking for a new twist and they have it. We had the traditional steak and shrimp type meal but they also have salads and sandwiches, brunch. Dessert was the bomb! White chocolate bread pudding. My husband loved the prime rib stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Uninspired! Very average. Staff very perfunctory. Eat here soon before it is gone. Ha!"}
{"text":"We love Alton's and practically live there we eat there at least once a week and the service is always great and friendly! Whenever we go the food is always amazing and we love the bar. There are TVs around the bar with Games on, and just the place overall is so nice, it's neat, and is very fancy. We love Alton's and I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Awesome first dinner at Alton's. Stuffed mushrooms and Prime rib excellent. A slow night but service was outstanding and wait staff attentive. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent. We used a Groupon, which was great value, but even without it, the value would have been excellent. Attentive but not disruptive service. Delicious food - sirloin medallions (daily special) and lamb shank. Really very flavorful and just excellent. Would highly recommend and would definitely return. Probably one of the top three meals I've ever had in NC."}
{"text":"I come here about once a month for brunch. I love the beer chaser that is served with the Bloody Charleston. Top notch chicken and waffles and awesome eggs Benedict combinations.  If you're super hungry, start with the Chips and 3 Dips appetizer."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Alton's! It is my favorite restaurant in the Lake Norman area. Although I've been quite a few times, I'll just review when I was here for a Thursday evening last week with a friend. We ordered a bottle of their house wine to share (pinot grigio - very good for $18!!) and I ordered the trout with succotash. I am not a huge fish person, but I order fish every single time I come here! The trout was seasoned perfectly, and the succotash just tasted so fresh and delicious - not mushy or drowning in butter! My friend had the lobster roll, which she's gotten multiple times as well and she always raves about it. I love everything about this place, including the wonderful service! (Quick note: my husband and I came a couple of weeks ago, and they were doing a mock 'restaurant week' to get ready for the real thing, and it was fabulous - WELL worth the $30. The appetizers were huge, and I ordered the sea bass as I almost always do because it's perfect every time! Their key lime pie cheesecake is also one of the best I've ever had!)"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Great Food!  This is the kind of place where every member of the staff makes it their personal mission to make sure you are well taken care of, it feels more like you are dining among good friends than at a restaurant.  We used a groupon, which gave us $50 to spend on food and alcohol that we only paid $25 for.  We told them this from the start but there was never a hint of reduced service or skimping that you sometimes get when using such a steep discount.  As for the food, well it has been a long time since I left a restaurant and felt \"fully satisfied\".  I had the ribs and my wife had the fish of the day.  My wife had a raspberry martini and we split the oreo cheesecake for dessert.    The Ribs:  These were perfect!  Both the glaze and the cooking and the pairing with coleslaw and fries.    The Fish:  Again, perfect, this looked like the kind of dish you could see on a TV show.  My wife left very happy.  The Martini:  I tried it, and it tasted great.  The most impressive part of it however is that about halfway through dinner my wife had half of it still left.  Without prompting our waitress Holly came over and poured the remainder into a fresh chilled martini glass!  The Oreo Cheesecake:  This was a fantastic end to the meal!  A lot of places that serve an \"oreo cheesecake\" basically give you cheesecake with a crushed oreo crust.  This was much better!  The entire cheesecake was crafted to give you that fantastic oreo cream and chocolate with every bite."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant for several years off & on. Every time I've been here I haven't been treated well. The service is so poor & the owner goes around & talks to others about why they won't leave tips. I have spoken to many people in the lkn area about this restaurant. They've all said the food is great but the service is awful. Poor management,  poor experience. It all starts from the top. The owner proclaims to have great service & great waiters & ive never seen that while I've been eating here. The owner doesn't decide what a great experience is ...the patron does. I've just decided I will not be returning. I won't be telling anyone I know to ever go here. They don't give a damn about their clients as is obvious due to the lack of service. I'm passing this along to the people I know in the area. If you want to be treated like you don't matter ...go here!"}
{"text":"We found this place accidentally twice now. Two of the best meals of my life. If you don't eat here you are a terrible person."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and great service, but food was just ok.  I come from a long line of foodies, so maybe I'm just being difficult, but after reading all of the reviews, I was a little disappointed.  I would recommend it for cocktails and apps though."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Alton's. We live in South Carolina and were in the area looking at boats and found Alton's by accident. First, I will say that the location is appealing--the plaza feels upscale and trendy. Second, they need better signage so you know where the front door is located. Either we parked in the back (but the GPS brought us to what should be the front) or it's just weird. It took us a while to find a door and we ended up in the bar. Once we finally were seated, Maureen took great care of us and made excellent suggestions. It was early, and we learned their apps were six dollars until 6:30, so we decided to make a meal of those rather than order entrees. We sat on the patio--it was beautiful and relaxing. The lobster bisque was incredible--the small scoop of mashed potato they put in the center sounded strange at first, but the texture was amazing and the combination a winner. We also had the stuffed mushrooms. Oh. My. God. Okay, they were beyond amazing--the first time we've had mushrooms that weren't filled with breadcrumbs or mushy or dripping in oil. They were large, tender, and the filling absolutely delicious. The only drawback was the shrimp cocktail--it took forever (Maureen brought them last), which would have been okay since it was an early evening and we had nowhere else to be, but they were kind of mediocre and tough. The dipping sauce (mayo with maybe something added in? I don't know, but it was delicious) made up for it. The only other drawback was another table adjacent to us was left uncleared the entire time we were there. It obviously wasn't Maureen's table (we saw another server taking care of it when we arrived), but you'd think a manager would have come out and cleaned it up if that server's shift had ended. There were napkins and children's cups blowing on the patio. We will definitely be back. Service was excellent, and we are looking forward to trying other items on the menu! Be sure to order the mushrooms and the bisque!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy sitting the the bar area for a light dinner. Lovely fireplace. Highly recommend kale salad + grilled shrimp!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! Service was timely and waitress really knew about menu and was very helpful. Everything from starters to entree were delicious and cooked exactly right! Nice ambience too!"}
{"text":"Thank you Lexie for wonderful service! We enjoyed the Queens feast! The stuffed mushrooms could have been my entree, large portion and delicious! As first timers we found the parking  easy, the food spectacular and the service top notch. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food Really yummy.  They have a very nice selection, you can find something just right no matter what mood you're in.   Prime Rib Stuffed Mushroom appetizer was delicious, very hot & cheesy, felt like it came straight from the oven to our table - very nice start.  My wife had the Beef Tenderloin Flatbread, it was okay but be careful if you are not a fan of capers.  I had the Shaved Prime Rib French Dip - definitely served Rare (perfect for me!) and the dip was super.  The waitress offered to bring ketchup for the fries - I said yes but YOU DON'T NEED IT.  It feels funny to talk about fries but these were Fantastic- hot, salty, cut reaally skinny.  Don't know what they cooked them in -olive oil maybe?  I'm not great at identifying tastes like that,  but I can say for sure these tasted fabulous.  We skipped dessert but next time I'm saving room.  Recommended Only been here once, could definitely have the Prime Rib French Dip again.  Did I mention the fries?   Service Super!  It was a busy Friday night, we had reservations but it was almost 8 so probably didn't need them.  Our waitress had a very good pace of checking on us at the right times.  I asked her a couple of questions, which she answered with questions of her own - i.e., she was very good at helping you find what you wanted.  She gave us a great wine recommendation.  They also left a bottle of water on the table so we could refill our own glasses, which I liked so much I wonder why everyone doesn't do it.    Environment My wife & I wanted a nice dinner and some time to relax and chat.  Friday night was much louder than I expected, maybe it was just that we were seated between a large party and the bar area.  But at least it was lively and upbeat.  The space has an open feeling, like a cool upfitted industrial buidling, great chandeliers added an elegant touch.  Dim not dark.  Very clean, you get the feeling that all employees care and are paying attention.  Value Very good.  Bottom Line Alton's Kitchen needs to be on your go-to list.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Can't begin to tell you how AMAZING our entire experience was at Alton's.  The moment we walked in, the atmosphere said \"warm,\" \"clubbish\" and \"comfortable.\"  Our Bartender \"Vail\" was outstanding, serving us some of the best drinks we've had in memory.  I tried their Dragonberry caiparinia - sweet and spectacular.  Followed it with a Mojito - equally stellar.  We started with Fried Asparagus and rib-stuffed mushroom appetizers, both of which were very good.  As for entrées, where have you ever seen a 48oz prime rib???  We opted to split the 24oz PR as suggested by some folks we had just met at the bar, who come there often (and rightly so!)  My wife loves the end cut, I prefer mine medium-rare.  The chef was able to satisfy both of us, which is no small feat!  Probably the best Prime Rib we've ever had - succulent, flavorful, served bone-in and flawlessly seasoned.  The mashed potatoes, although only \"warm,\" were still excellent, and the kale side salad was superb.  We topped it off with the Oreo Ice Cream Cake dessert (again, recommended by our barmates) and it was to-die-for.  Throughout our time there we struck up conversations with both Vail and our new \"friends\" which made it seem like we were regulars.  DEFINITELY the place to go when you're in this area, simply a great experience, and one we'll be talking about for a long time!"}
{"text":"This was one of our favorites; loved the early bird specials. They no longer have them and don't offer a senior menu.  The food is always good, but large portions."}
{"text":"Called and asked about gluten free menu and they said no problem, wrong or they don't understand the question. Limited choices and not sure they really get the issue. The steak was not that good and the three pieces and asparagus just didn't make it. More of a bar than a restaurant though a nice setting."}
{"text":"We had a voucher for $30 so we decided to use it.  The building is beautiful and the room set up was very nice as well!  I love that they put water on the table for you.  The wait staff was very attentive.  We started with prime rib stuffed mushrooms and shrimp.  They were both wonderful, the mushrooms were unlike any I have ever had!  They were delicious.  The shrimp came with plenty for the whole table.   We all wanted the prime rib sandwich that they are famous for, but they did not have it that night.  We had orders if pork chops and trout.  The trout sauce was delicious and the fish was also good.  The pork chops were way too big, undercooked and salty.  The green rice is very good!  Due to all of the snafus with our table we were comped desserts.  OMG the desserts were to die for.  The apple dessert was soooooo good!  I could have had 10 bowls.  The new coconut vanilla pie was light and good, but didn't have ton of flavor.  The oreo dessert was also good.  Over all it was great dining.  The prices were very reasonable.  The berry mixed drink was amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and good food...  Recently went with a group of 20 people we had the back room all to ourselves.."}
{"text":"As a native New Englander, I can honestly say this lobster bisque is the best I've ever had. The Hawaiian Poke is outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there for the first time.  I got the cheeseburger and it was really good.  The bun was soft and a little sweet.  They cooked it the way I wanted it.  The fries were very tasty."}
{"text":"Consistently a great experience. Staff, food and atmosphere. It is a go to favorite for two or a group!"}
{"text":"The bartender makes this place feel like Cheers! Food just okay. The lighting (lack of) is so dark that I couldn't even tell if the place was clean. Wondered if that was by design??? If a bartender could bring me back, I would go."}
{"text":"I will begin by saying the Lobster Bisque was wonderful and if you want a side salad, the portion is very generous. I did not finish mine so I would have enough room for the main course. My husband had a NY Strip, I had the Lamb Shank which was gigantic. Unfortunately, the meat was dry and my mashed potatoes were on the cold side. Our wine glasses were hot and the service wasn't great. It was ok all and all. Desert menu wasn't great and we passed. We won't be back for dinner but maybe for a cocktail some time."}
{"text":"We had salmon and tuna which was really good and their kale salad yummy...however the prime rib which was pricey should have been top notch tasted like leftovers from the weekend( we were there on Monday) and reaheated. Dry! Otherwise srervice good and wine selection is ok."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday afternoon for dinner with my folks and my dog. We sat outside on the patio since we had the dog with us. Service was fantastic and very attentive. They even brought out a bowl of water for the dog. Menu is not huge but has a variety of entrees plus salads and sandwiches. Had the kale Caesar which was very tasty- wish they had a vegetarian option too. Nice location in shop area by Harris Teeter. Dress was business casual- lots of after work happy hour goers. I would come again."}
{"text":"This building almost seems cursed from the failed restauarants last 10 years. I heard good things so after going back 3 more times I am a believer that these owners truly know what they are doing. The servers were confident and knowledgeable of a menu I suspected to see more in L.A. / NYC not LKN. A great selection of wine and the atmosphere from the dining room to the bar is open, comfortable and really pleasant. curse broken"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim. Lucky us, Sunday and Monday is half price bottle night!  No wait and looks like by the time we arrived around 7, the afterwork LKN crowd were slowly leaving the bar. We were seated in the dining area on the main floor but being it was so super nice outside, we could have sat on their patio. After reviewing the menu, I almost decided on getting nothing but appetizers. The choices were minimal but great selections. Our waitress lacked a little personality but the food and experience were the goal for the night. I could have picked the salmon special or even a steak but decided to go off-course for my first visit. Opted for the pork chop - which came out the size of a brick but cooked and seasoned to perfection. Mashed potatoes, broccolini and string squashed sides were equally as satisfying. Nothing let us down. The crab cake was typical for a non-seafood restaurant. The 'icing on the cake' is their north cove salad, with candy pecans, craisins, goat cheese crumbles.... And more topped with champagne vinaigrette. I will be back!"}
{"text":"It's good, don't get me wrong, but it really just doesn't compare to some of the other upscale restaurants in the area, such as 131 main. This is a good comparison because both have small menus and pride themselves on all of their ingredients being fresh.   I've been to Alton's a fair amount of times. We didn't opt for an appetizer tonight, but some of the dips looked good. I got the ribs with a twice baked potato. The ribs were good, coleslaw subpar, but the twice baked potato was one of the best I've ever had. Not sure what was different about this potato but it was cooked well and the inside was creamy and delicious. I usually opt for the ribs here. It's a full rack and they're tasty.   The service was good as our waitress knew the menu well and was attentive. We finished with the Oreo ice cream dessert, which is always on the menu and is good. It's similar to an Oreo ice cream sandwich. We also got the strawberry shortcake, which was the dessert special and this was not good. The \"cake\" was far too salty. It was hard to eat.   Altons is one of the nicer options in the Cornelius area, but hasn't quite made its way into the upper echelon of upscale restaurants in the Lake Norman area. 131 main and Epic Chophouse are some tastier options."}
{"text":"My dining partner and I went to Alton's tonight for the first and last time. It was the last night of a $30 Groupon offer and I was looking forward to a nice meal.  I had read the negative reviews, some of which were written seven months ago, so I hoped that they had straighten out any problems they had dealing with their own Groupon offer.  We drove over 25 mile to get their so we left early in hopes of avoiding northbound weekend traffic. I had read and understood that I could not combine my Groupon purchase with any of their special offers; so when we arrived by chance in time for their early dining special I told the waiter that we would have separate checks to which he replied that it would not be a problem. I added that I would be using a Groupon for me to which he literally high fived me since I had gotten there on the last night before it expired.   The very nice waiter took our drink orders and left us with the menus.  I had studied the menu online and knew that it would be NO problem for me to spend well over $30 by myself, but who likes to dine alone so I invited a guest to join me. I expressed to my dining partner that their was no reason he HAD to order from the \"specials\" menu, but he expressed that it was exactly what he was in the mood for since it included an appetizer and dessert. When the waiter returned with our drinks he told us that we could not order the special if we were using the Groupon. I reminded him that we were getting separate checks and that I would NOT be ordering the special.  I told him that I had read about a similar problem with a previous customer of theirs and that is why I told them up front that we would be having separate checks.  I was going to order warm bread at $2, the Ahi Appetizer at $11, the filet at $25, and cobbler for dessert at $6 plus a beverage well over the $30 Groupon purchase not to mention my dining partner's meal and drinks.  He said that we could not sit at the same table, but that he would check with the manager.  I was shocked at the absurd idea of two people having to sit at two separate tables in order to enjoy a night out which was initiated by their own Groupon offering. Another man arrived who said we were trying to nickel and dime them and that they were loosing money on every Groupon dinner.  I offered to pay for the few sips we had of our beverages and left with a sour taste in my mouth never to return again!"}
{"text":"This is the best lake area restaurant hands  down.  Brian and Jess are outstanding bar staff."}
{"text":"I have been to Altons 5 or 6 times and I must say that this is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. The menu is small but done extremely well. Each time I go I try to get a different item. Everything I've tried has been perfect.  The lamb shank, filet and scallops are the top 3 things I've tried. However the ribs are amazing also.  I've never been there when a huge crowd has been present which is surprising but one of the things I also love about this place. The Sunday brunch is a very busy time, and it is also wonderful.  I highly recommend you try this restaurant. It can get pricey however I've always felt that it's worth the money."}
{"text":"Gotta try this place again. Went for appetizers and drinks. This was a nice quiet hidden gem. This location is bad and would never know it was there. I would recommend this place and have heard good things about dinner there. Nice bar and very happy with the friendly service."}
{"text":"We came here for Queens Feast, Charlotte's restaurant week. The restaurant was very nice and the staff was very friendly.   The food was great! The fillet was almost perfect. It was a little salty, but good. The mash potatoes were very think and creamy. And the asparagus was ever so tender. For desert I got the bread pudding which was perfect in every way!  I recommend the place for a nice romantic for business meal!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I had the nightly special (shrimp and angel hair pasta with fresh spinach and pine nuts in a lemon sauce). This dish was spectacular.  My husband had the ribeye steak with the twice baked potato. He said it was the best ribeye he'd ever had and the twice baked potato was fabulous.  Some reviewers said steaks were too salty but this was not the case for us. My husband often thinks things are too salty but this was not the case here. Great atmosphere. I only give 4 stars because the service was slow and the server was a bit hurried because they were busy. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went the weekend after Valentine's day.  And let me tell you alton's did not disappoint. Our waitress Emily was AMAZING!!! Since it was our first time eating here we weren't  sure what to get and she recommend everthing from appetizers, main course, and even drinks. We had the lobster bisque, loaded fries, and the stuffed mushrooms for appetizers; all were great for main course my husband had the steak skewers with mashed potatoes and I had the ribs and mashed potatoes. And wow the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. And for dessert we both had the bread pudding. Again they did not disappoint. For drinks I had a cucumber ginger drink that again Emily suggested it was by far the most refreshing, enjoyable drink I've ever had. We will definitely come back to Alton's Kitchen and hopefully will get him early again as a waitress she was great."}
{"text":"I'm a semi-regular customer and drive from Charlotte, so it requires some effort. On my last trip the artichokes were tough. Could not eat them. Food is generally good. Atmosphere is okay. But what bothered me most about the last trip we overheard what I assume to be a manager embarrassing a new staff member. It was uncalled for and very unprofessional."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed the restaurant for years .  The atmosphere is great and the service and food are even better. Try the Pittsburgh salad you won't regret it !"}
{"text":"We stopped in Altons for Saturday brunch. It was a beautiful day, so we sat out on their gorgeous private patio. Upon glancing over the brunch menu, my first impressions were that they love their pecans - pecan French toast, waffles, pecan pumpkin dessert. While these all sound delicious, sadly I'm allergic to nuts. Tragic. They have plenty of other options though! They have a variety of benedicts, burgers, flatbreads, chicken and waffles, and shrimp and grits. I was missing the typical omelet selection for brunch, though.   I went with the salmon Benedict. It was fantastic, and different from other smoked salmon benedicts I've had because it was almost like a salmon salad. There may have been a wee bit too much hollandaise sauce for my liking, but I really enjoyed the dish, capers and all! I also got the breakfast potatoes alongside, which were also fantastic. They come with parmesan cheese on them! My hubby went with the pecan French toast, but we were able to get it without pecans. Again, a little different from your typical French toast! It comes baked in a ramekin, and every bite is delicious. You'll even find white chocolate chips in there! It's very reminiscent of a sweet bread pudding.   Also, cocktails. They have a pretty great special with a $5 brunch cocktail list. We went with Bloody Mary's, which come with bacon, celery, and a mini Miller High Life. Something different. The service was great, everyone we encountered was friendly. We will definitely be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Good food, Horrible Service: Had a reservation for 7pm, they had us go to the bar while we waited for our table took almost 5 minutes of standing at the bar before getting greeted. Drinks were poured 10 minutes later as our table became available. Once we were sat the server came up to us and the first words of his mouth were \"are y'all ready to order\"? No greeting, no name, no outline of the menu, nothing. He never even brought us water throughout our whole meal. We ordered wine after he slammed the house wine for being poor quality. When he brought the bottle of wine, he poured my female dates wine first. Finally asked his name and he told us it was Keenan. No smiles, nothing. Just an absolute horrible customer service experience. The food tasted good or else this would be a one star review. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This was my first Multiple Sclerosis function I attended since moving to the Charlotte area and boy was I pleasantly surprised when it was held at Alton's Kitchen & Cocktails. The food was delicious I had the Baked Salmon with a side of Red mashed potatoes. The waiters were very helpful considering I have a disability and everything was assessable for me, I will be back again for the Bread Pudding which was magnificent for dessert. !!! Two Thumbs Up!!!"}
{"text":"I think I've tried everything here hahaha Amazing atmosphere, fantastic food and spectacular service!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood gem with some solid menu options and a few that could use a little TLC.   Overall, the food was good, the portions were healthy, and the ambiance was wonderful. I'd come here with friends for a special lunch or dinner, or plan an office holiday party in their private upstairs area. The servers are attentive. The sweet tea is delicious. The parking is easy!   The dip sampler appetizer was awesome, though the chips were a little too salty for my taste. The creole shrimp entree tasted so good -- the flavors were spot on! Next time I think I'd order something else for my meal, because the crab & shrimp Louie salad was a little blah. The white chocolate bread pudding was very good -- but huge! (Share your dessert with a friend unless you have a separate dessert stomach like I do ... even then your second stomach might not be able to conquer the delicious dessert mountain.)"}
{"text":"Like Rob, I was unaware of Alton's until they popped up on this year's (2012) Queens Feast.  First observations:   The place is pretty spacious & as Rob also pointed out, the tables aren't cramped together. The bar has its own separate area & isn't crowded in with diners.  However, are hi-top tables in the bar area.  There's an upstairs dining area.  One thing I didn't like was how dim the lighting was. I know they're trying to go for an intimate vibe, but I would have liked a little more light, personally.  Wait staff is dressed in nice white button down shirts, but have blue jeans on with black skirt aprons.  Bottled water (literally) comes pre-chilled in a glass bottle with a beer bottle type cap.  Warm earth tone colors throughout the restaurant.  Appetizers:  I had the stuffed mushrooms caps with cheese, prime rib & horseradish. So yummy & HOT - as in the plate was like 500 degrees!  But these 10 or so mushrooms caps were delicious. My boyfriend had the shrimp cocktail, which came with 4 large shrimp, tarter sauce & cocktail sauce.  Both sauces tasted homemade.  Salads:  He had the romaine wedge, which is basically just a large romaine lettuce piece with toppings.  I had the house salad, which was full of yumminess - tomatoes, croutons, real bacon, cucumbers & cheese.  My salad was fresh & tasty.  Entrees:  I had the prime rib & garlic mashed potatoes. Here's where my stomach was almost begging for mercy!  The steak was HUGE & there was a pile of Idaho goodness on the plate.  The steak was cooked to my medium well order & seasoned perfectly. Needless to say, I could not eat all of it.  The au jus sauce was delicious, as was the horseradish sauce.  Shawn had the filet medallions, which had crab meat on top & the same mashed potatoes I did.  Delightful!  Dessert:  We both had the apple cobbler with vanilla bean ice cream.  Thank goodness this were served in a small dessert dish!  The cobbler was amazing. And here's an interesting twist: there were pecans in it! What a nice surprise...it did add a little extra something to the cobbler.  Service was excellent. We sat down & immediately someone came over & got our drink orders.  Next up was our waitress...she was very attentive, came around & checked on us only a few times (perfect in my book) & came & took away plates in a timely manner.  From the looks of it, their bar menu is extensive - hence the name, \"Alton's Kitchen and Cocktails\".  Charlotte folks: it is worth the short drive to Cornelius to dine here!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Had friends in from Western New York so we took them there for drinks and dinner. The food was fantastic and the wine selection was decent, however they could use some more beer choices. The owner came to the table to say hello which is a great touch. I highly recommend you go there for dinner, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to brunch this past Sunday with Family!  The food was amazing and the service was on point! Simone, our server was fast friendly and very accommodating! (Even for my picky cousin)  Jessi the manager came over and made sure that everything was going ok and was very friendly!  Ben the bartender was very accommodating and took care of me and my cousins very well! In my case the prime rib hash was tender and very flavorful! All in all we had a great time and a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I had great lunch at Alton's this weekend. The restaurant is large and open. We were greeted  by a friendly hostess and sat at a large round table. I liked this better than your typical rectangle because you could see everyone in the party. I had the tuna poke for my meal. It was served chilled with warm chips. The tuna was fresh and was cut well. The avocado was ripe but not too mushy. The sauce was tasty as well. I sampled the french dip. It was one of the best french dips I have tried. The meat was tender and flavorful. For dessert we shared the white chocolate bread pudding. It was served hot from the oven. I was moist and had a yummy crunchy topping. I also tried their oreo dessert which was tasty as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I just tried this place for the first time. The restaurant itself is beautiful, but it was a nice evening so we chose to dine in their outdoor patio area, which is very nice. Our food was very good, and I especially love their coleslaw.  The service was excellent. We decided that the next time we have out of town guests, this is where we will bring them for dinner. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Used my living social deal to enjoy a great Sunday brunch at Alton's.  I was hoping to get in and out so I could get home in time for football and the quick service here didn't disappoint.  I'm sure it helped that I already knew what I wanted for a  change:-). My son had the chicken and waffles which would have been perfect if the chicken tenders had less batter and more seasoning, but the waffle was very good.  My shrimp and grits were very different as far as shrimp and grits go...not bad but different...the sauce was sweet and creamy with shrimp, sausage, corn, and asparagus with a grilled toast that was my favorite part of the meal.  I still don't know if the so called grits were actually grits but didn't look or taste like any I've ever had.....not bad overall.."}
{"text":"My ribeye was cooked to perfection ... very tender & juicy cut - loved it.  I loved the twice baked potato as well.  The Godiva Latte Martini is a star here.   The salmon was amazing as well ... nice grill marks and not overcooked - very creamy.  Our waiter, Jeffery, was checking on us about every three minutes ... dropping refills without being asked.  The manager checked on us several times too."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with great potential.  Wait staff is very good and presentation of the food was excellent.  Unfortunately our steaks were undercooked, salad dressing was bland, and the lobster bisque was just OK.  But I must say that we loved the atmosphere and the wait staff.  We'll definitely give it another try!"}
{"text":"Just celebrated easter with my family at Alton's kitchen. This was our first time here and we were pleasantly surprised by both the decor and ambiance as well as the actual food.   There are 2 very cute outside eating areas that I can envision myself bringing a friend for a couple cocktails to enjoy this summer!    When you walk in it is industrial ceilings meets brink wall meets chandeliers. Love it!  It's the right amount of interesting and sophistication without being pretentious.   We all ordered the easter brunch buffet and 5 out of 6 of us LOVED everything that touched our lips. The other person thought everything was over seasoned. I will agree that everything is heavily seasoned so if you prefer food simply seasoned you might have also been disappointed. But on the down side no one asked us if everything was ok. If they had I might have suggested my grandmother order from the menu. We did have a waiter who promptly refilled our drinks and removed plates but didn't check in to see how things were or if we needed anything.  He stopped by once after filling our initial drink order probably 30 minutes into the meal and then with the check.   The only reason I am giving this 4 out of 5 stars is because the food on the buffet was room temp at best.  I'm not talking 1 or 2 things. I'm talking everything except the mashed potatoes which were piping hot as they should be. In my wildest dreams I wouldn't have thought any restaurant could earn a 4 serving cold food but that's how good it was.   Had we arrived 45 min later our experience would have been drastically different because the replacement dishes that some of us went back for seconds for were ALL over cooked and dried out. For example the prime rib on our first pass was medium, super tender and the au Jus was superb. The next prime rib to come out was so over cooked the meat was grey.   I will go back in hope the second round of food was a fluke and certainly will say something if I find the food cold again."}
{"text":"was there a few months ago. the salt was over the top.  The lobster (or was it crab?) bisque was so salty it hurt my tongue.  the other courses were too salty as well.  I do like my salt but not like this.  I didn't want to send the main course back, we were with friends and having a nice night.  not anxious to return for such high pricing and low satisfaction,  Dining room was way too dark as well"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The husband and I celebrated our 13th anniversary here tonight while checking out the area on a weekend trip.  The food was great...so great I didn't even snap any pics to post because I could t wait to dig in.  We had the stuffed mushrooms, which were super delicious.  I had the lamb, which was so moist it fell off the bone.  The husband had the filet and was also super pleased.  Dessert was the best part...the white chocolate bread pudding was to die for.  OMG, I can still taste it...so fabulous.  Very pleased overall and will definitely return if ever back in town."}
{"text":"Solid food.  Its great to have another restaurant like this in the Lake Norman area.  The dinner deal that was mentioned in another review is available until 7 I think.  My wife took advantage of the deal and had the half chicken half rack of ribs with a side of fries, and started the meal with the included salad.  The salad was fresh and the homemade champaign vinaigrette tasty.  The ribs were tender, easily came off the bone.  Chicken was leg and thigh, juicy with a generous amount of barbecue sauce.  The only mildly disappointing part of the 3 course $15 meal was the dessert.  I guess I just expected more than Breyers vanilla.  I ordered the french dip for dinner which was lean and a perfect medium rare.  I had twice baked potatoes as my side that were cheesy and crisp at the top.  I look forward to going back, and I would even say that its worth the trip from Charlotte for anyone contemplating it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots! We have been back several times. The food is amazing!!!!!!!!! Best dishes are the Ribs and the Creole Shrimp BBQ! I really cant even list the best cause I have never had a bad thing here. the atmosphere is great I love the fireplace and I love that the staff wear oxford polo's this is a must visit! I was just there last night for my anniversary and we noticed that there are \"kitchen beers\" on the menu we learned that you can buy the staff beers which we did to thank them for another job well done. The fresh OJ is my fav and they carry my favorite wines, Butter and Meomi! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about Alton's from neighbors and friends. Today, on one of my busiest days of my work life (end of my fiscal year). I decided to go out and have a little steak and and a cocktail. The bartender was nice and friendly and quickly got me a drink. Ordered food, and then was made aware of a man totally berating a woman four or five seats down. Not quietly, but obnoxious New Yorker style. I work in NYC and DC, so I am used to that demeanor- but for christ sake get a table outside or away from everyone. Food came, steak was dry, fries overcooked and appetizer pop-up's were horrible. Asked for the check, asked the bartender why he didn't say anything to the obnoxious man and he let me know that he was a big bar owner in NODA as he defended him. The food sucked, the atmosphere was one step away from Jerry Springer - won't go back to Altons or their higher priced sister location 31. Maybe I am spoiled eating in finer establishments in NYC or DC and just set the bar to high for Charlotte and the Metro area."}
{"text":"We had cocktails while attending an event, which were great. We will come back for food because it looked great."}
{"text":"Took my husband and I a while to finally find this place. Worst location evaaar. No wonder this spot has a high turn around. It's almost like finding a needle in a haystack. Service and atmosphere was great. I ordered their filet special with the Gorgonzola & Bleu cheese sauce with the twice baked potato. AMAZING. I'm small and petite so the portion was PERFECT. I even had a little bit for a doggy bag. My husband ordered the prime rib (medium rare) but came out rare. That's why I'm giving it a 4 star."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the food quality, innovative menu and service at Alton's.  This space is gigantic. If you are looking for a place to host an event they seem very well equipped to host several at once.  They have an Oreo ice cream dessert with hot fudge and it is well worth the indulgence. If you are in the area and want big city food at the lake, Alton's is your best bet."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very nice lunch. The $5 cocktails are very tasty.  The fresh salads are huge and you can easily split them with a friend. I sat at the bar and it was very nice with speedy service. This is a lovely restaurant and I will definitely return with more of my friends."}
{"text":"Looking for a meal on a lazy Monday night. My wife and started the same old discussion. What are we having for dinner? We got in the car not knowing exactly where we are going.  We decided to try a new place Alton's.  We were there early so the place wasn't very busy. We were seated immediately and our drink order was taken. The menu has a very nice variety so it is easy to find something to order. My wife ordered pop overs $4 that she says were very good. She also ordered a entree size salad. The salad had crab meat- shrimp-avocado-hard boiled egg- tomato-greens and dressing $17. She really enjoyed it, it was right up her alley. I ordered a NY Strip steak that came with French fries $25. The steak was edible but I wouldn't have called it a NY Strip. It was a steak about 1/3\" thick and sliced. The shoes string French fries were frozen fries, I believe coated in corn starch to make them crispy. I hate that type of fry. All natural restaurant cut potatoes are much better. The steak dinner as I said was edible but I felt ripped off at $25. I think $16.98 would have made me feel better. The place itself is very nice. The bar menu was extensive. The service was excellent. I won't say don't try it. I'm going back to try it again. I won't order fries or the NY Strip."}
{"text":"After hearing nothing but good things about this restaurant my husband and I dined there last night. We ordered the special which was rib eye steak and twice baked potatoes.  The meat was rough and not cooked as ordered, potatoes were burnt. Burnt was the only flavor!  I will say the lobster bisque soup was good and so was Emily our waitress.  Sorry to say our first trip was also our last."}
{"text":"Awesome Food and great atmosphere! We go here all the time! Try the swordfish it's incredible delicious"}
{"text":"Great Upscale Dining in the Lake Norman Area  Alton's has been a fixture in the Lake Norman Area since around 2010.  It's a upscale restaurant but was the first in the State to offer an outside area where you could dine with your dog and they would also provide for the animal.  At least they have a sense of humor and respect for the customers.  Very much like another Cornelius landmark 131 Main.  Menu has an emphasis of fresh and flavorful.  I've tried a number of items on the menu but keep coming back to the Prime Rib cooked medium rare.  Always perfect, always flavorful and always cooked just the way I like it.  Bone In Pork Chops are great also  My wife on the otherhand, generally goes for the Pittsburgh which is a salad topped with grilled beef tenderloin and as you can guess from the name, topped with fries.  Seems like only a year but probably a bit longer than that, they added a Sunday Brunch.  This is one of our favorites and was a favorite of my late Sister-in-Law.  The Chicken and Waffles were great and she enjoyed the Eggs Benedict.  Service is always good and last week was no exception. In all of our visits, I can only think of one occassion where service was less than stellar but management did respond to our concerns and we never had another problem.  Atmosphere is dark wood with tinted windows so the lighting is a bit low. It occupies the space previously occupied by a much larger Italian restaurant and rather than fill up all of the space, they chose to spread out so that no patron feels squeezed and has their own space.  I like that."}
{"text":"Top notch food. Now I only had two appetizers but, they were off the charts. Excellent Poke, and I've had homemade poke from many Hawaiians. This version was amazing. Now the atmosphere, quite pretentious but, not shocking for this area of town. Drink specials, really are non existent unless you want a Sangria for $5. I would say that any sangria isn't worth $5 as I can either make my own or purchase a pretty decent bottle of the stuff for just as cheap so , not really much of a deal. They categorize this as a day drink. not sure what other drinks fall into this category but this is really the only deal. Now the half off apps, now thats a freaking deal. I had the prime rib stuffed mushrooms and the Poke. AMAZING.  I would go again and again for this deal!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Alton's tonight to celebrate three birthdays. VERY DISAPPOINTED to say the least. Steaks were horrible!!!! The potatoes served with their special filet medallions were barely warm.  I had lobster bisque.....first time i ever had a lump of mashed potatoes served with this. Usually, you get a lump of lobster!! Most restaurants offer a dessert for the birthday folks but not this place! As I said, our first trip and our LAST!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely unorganized! Waited over 30 minutes with a reservation before having to talk to a manager to get seated. Then they were out of over 5 entrees and took an hour to get our food. They barely offered any compensation and all just seemed very flustered. Very disappointed for such a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a nice place, no doubt about it. Overall I enjoyed Alton's and will go back...nice menu, good wine selection, very upscale...however...  Three stars for two reasons...a mis-prepared meal and a waiter who started off solid but faded quickly. He offered to bring a sample of a wine I inquired about, but then never followed through.  After our food arrived our waiter was nowhere to be found. It was lost on others in our party but not me...I pay attention to that stuff and he was MIA the entire remainder of the meal.   Food was good for everyone except one whose meal wasn't cooked correctly (underdone). Manager stepped in and corrected it with a brisk response and pleasant attitude, so kudos for that (but no offer of a complimentary dessert or beverage which at this place would have been expected and an appropriate response as others waited to eat). At a place of this caliber that's a no-no.   So bottom line - I'll try it once more, but for these prices I'll ride herd more closely on waitstaff. If this is a recurring issue...there won't be a third visit."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, very large beautiful place. Very nice service. Lots on the menu to pick from, great drink menu as well. Everything was very good, very fresh. Portions are generous and prices are good. I had the fried asparagus wish the batter was a little crisper, but was good and look at the size of the portion, it's an appetizer!!! Huge. Popovers were yummy too, with honey butter, oh yeah!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Had the special: Swordfish on a bed of grits w/spinach! Delish!"}
{"text":"Today was my 2nd visit, the first visit was solidly three stars...this visit was a step above.  Lobster bisque....delicious.  It comes with a dollop of mashed potatoes...that was different, but yummy!  Even though I was there for brunch with the girls, I ended up getting lunch.  I was super jazzed to see a Pittsburgh salad on the menu.  For those of you who don't know, that's a salad with FRENCH FRIES on top.  Usually a steak salad.  Oh yeah, it's great..not healthy at all though. LOL.  Well the salad was good, but not what I was expecting.  As a former Pittsburgh-er I know what it should be.  Typically a creamy salad dressing with larger fries (not steak fries, but not shoe string) on top.  This salad had a tarragon vinaigrette dressing and blue cheese crumbles - oh and bacon.  The fries were mixed into the salad and were very much like Steak and Shake fries- super skinny.   The only thing semi warm on the salad was the steak.    So with all of that said.....I really enjoyed it once I got passed the 'what the hell' factor.  I'm a  fan - the service was good and well.  Check out Altons, if your GPS can get you there.  Both times it's taken me different ways, but luckily it's been daytime. I can see having issue at night if you are unfamiliar w/ that part of Cornelius."}
{"text":"Sunday night is typically not the best at many places but this place was a wonderful from food the service.  Ribeye top quality."}
{"text":"Customer service is lacking.  Called recently to make a reservation for eight people.  Instead of accommodating the reservation request I was told that the reservation could be held, however, they could not guarantee that we would all be seated at one table, even after I explained it was a holiday gathering with gift exchange.  So frustrating, how do they stay in business?  They have no clue what customer service involves."}
{"text":"Fathers' Day Dinner first time for us. Excellent food, service and atmosphere. Best prime rib that I have had lately. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I love this place for Sunday brunch. I can usually walk right in even with a group and be seated right away. The burger is pretty awesome (it's around $6 on Tuesdays), and the chicken and waffles are good too. I can't eat brunch here without ordering the Baked French Toast, it's a show stopper."}
{"text":"Came here during Restaurant Week for birthday dinner #2.  Alton's is tucked away in the corner of a shopping strip in front of Harris Teeter. We kind of had a hard time finding it and then figuring out which side was the front door.  The restaurant was really nice and seemed to have a lot of spaces for private events. They take reservations but you have to call the restaurant to make them. We were immediately seated once arriving and our waitress immediately came to our table once we were seated to get our drink orders.  I ordered from the RW menu and ordered the Lobster Bisque, the Surf and Turf and the Apple Crisp for dessert. The Lobster Bisque was hearty and full of flavor. I liked the small amount of whipped potatoes in the middle of the Bisque. The Surf and Turf was great, the lobster was seasoned and baked well done. The steak came on a kabob but was big pieces of beef. The asparagus were huge but sautéed just enough were they were not too soft but also not too crunchy. My favorite entrée of the meal was the apple crisp, I ate it before I could take a picture of it. The brown sugar, pecan crumble was amazing and the ice cream complemented the crisp really well."}
{"text":"Oyster sliders are awesome.  Fish tacos are great.  Short rib chili is super tender and delicious but not a huge size.  Awesome atmosphere with high ceilings, lots of dark woods, and the bar is separate from restaurant so not overly noisy."}
{"text":"Interesting seeing that this place is a 4 star restaurant. I came here blind, so without looking at any reviews, I came in thinking I was extremely under dressed. Oh well, you know how I do it.  So getting seated pretty quickly, as this place was pretty empty for the day that we were eating, everything seemed pretty copacetic. (I didn't know how to spell that word! Learning new things everyday...) The service was friendly, and people there were nice, oh, southern hospitality what do you expect?  Let's get straight to the food. I ordered the Seattle Style Salmon. Complete letdown. You must be wondering, why this place isn't a one star, well because of service and the \"okay\" lobster bisque. Okay, let's get to my reasoning.  Seattle Style Salmon. $22. [On the menu as the day review was released] And what you get is a huge plate, with less than a bowl of rice and a flat piece of salmon. When I say flat, I mean flat. I know the picture doesn't really highlight how outrageous it was, because I had to do some photo magic to make it look better than it was. So yes, small piece of salmon and some rice. The rest of the plate was empty.   The first thought: \"Damn, that's a big plate\" followed by \"I think they used the wrong plate\" and ending \"$22 though?\" After coming to this restaurant, I just shake my head in sadness, because good Chinese food is $13-15 and that's too \"expensive\", except it can feed 2-3 people. Where in comparison, you can spend $22 on a small thin piece of salmon that's lightly flavored with some rice and nod in approval.  All I'm saying is maybe this restaurant deserves 4 stars, but for that entree, um, no thanks. Hey, maybe this place is a lunch place, as the reviews would suggest that this place is packed. Not going to lie, some of their other dishes look pretty tasty.   If I were to come back, I would try the ribs out. Or their Lobster Roll. Who knows, maybe next time they'll get a 4 star review from me, but this meal no way."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch on Mother's Day and the food & service were good, especially in light of the crowd. I suspect they're even better on a less hectic occasion. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time. We sat in the bar area and service was good. Great menu, food was very good too. Love the decor and my wife appreciated that not all TVs had sports, something for all to watch  Will try again soon and review again. FYI make a res on the weekend"}
{"text":"Just had a great meal at Alton's. My first time here. The shrimp creole was awesome. Great flavor.  White chocolate bread pudding was delicious. Service was terrific and the ambience was great - casually elegant but not stuffy.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"SLOW. SLOW. SLOW.  1 1/2 hours for salad, steak and dessert.  food good.  potatoes a little sticky.  bread pudding good, but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was in this plaza and looking for lunch! I noticed a ton of chains when I was driving in but was hoping for something a bit different. Luckily the Yelp app let me know that this place was literally right around the corner from where I was! It was a Saturday early afternoon and at first glance they looked closed but they were open and ready for business. There was only two other tables occupied in the whole place. I think the Saturday brunch thing is new for them so they are probably still trying to build up awareness for it.  They had a pretty good array of breakfast items and I ended up going with the veggie Benedict. It was really tasty with avocado, tomato, asparagus (only two stalks), poached egg, with a bernaise sauce. Which tasted so similar to hollandaise I don't think many people could even tell the difference. My friend got the lobster roll with a side salad and really enjoyed it.  Our waitress was friendly and always around when we needed her. If I am in this area again I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times since I moved to Davison a year ago.  They usually serve decent food . My last visit I ordered steak and eggs for brunch ,  It was very disappointing . For some weird reason they could not make eggs scrambled soft! The lady in charge actually came to my table and told me the hard pancake like egg blanket was the softest that they could do . They did remake my eggs , and it was a plain omelet . I had higher regard and expectations before this incident for Altons. Now I know not to bother with their brunch. What chef could not make soft scrambled eggs?! Any grocery store clerk in New York knows , lol"}
{"text":"Tonight we have to give only one star. We were celebrating a birthday and my wife ordered the swordfish. The meals arrived and my wife's first bite was into a ROTTEN piece of fish. Unfortunately she swallowed some of it. They took her meal away and a manager comes by and says, \"We're sorry you didn't like your meal.\" Didn't Like her meal?!!! We corrected her and told her the fish was BAD. They offered to fix something else but my wife's appetite was ruined. She couldn't eat at all. The waitress said they took her meal off the bill. No kidding!!!  The bad fish was one thing. The handling of the problem was the kicker. The manager trying to \"spin\" that my wife didn't \"like\" her food was so unprofessional.  What happened here is easily avoidable by first smelling the fish before preparing it. I have worked in the food service space for 40 years, and almost never saw a cook smell fish first. They pull it out of the cooler instead, and assume it's fresh. This is wrong.   All said, they ruined my wife's evening and the birthday.  One star folks. That's all you deserve."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the area and when we saw that Alton's was a part of Charlottes Restaurant week we decided to give it a try. And wow... we walked away with the best experience. We had reservations and were seated right away. Our waitress Maureen was polite, prompt and very helpful! We ordered the prime rib stuffed mushrooms which were unreal they were so delicious. For entrees we both ordered the surf and turf which was the best lobster and filet mignon I have ever had. It was tender and juicy the lobster wasn't rubbery it was cooked perfectly and the filet just melted in your mouth. For dessert we ordered the Oreo cookie ice cream sandwich and the apple cobbler which was the perfect way to top off an amazing meal! Overall the experience was 5 star! We will be back :)."}
{"text":"Purchased this as a Groupon and was not disappointed. Enjoyed an early dinner of the North Cove Salad and husband had the cheeseburger. Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. Shall I say it again? Excellent! The Champagne Vinaigrette Salad Dressing was the perfect compliment. And the cheesburger? Well, hubby said it's the best he ever had - even better fries. Don't forget to order the Mr T's Cocktail - you won't be sorry. Had to stop on the way home and buy a bottle of Firefly Sweet Tea Vodka! (Attentive Wait Staff - Ask for Sean)"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary. It was highly recommended by a few people we knew, so we decided to give it a try.   The atmosphere is nice, it's dimly lit with beautiful chandeliers throughout. The staff were friendly and the food came fairly quickly.  I ordered the lobster bisque as an appetizer and it was pretty good. I ordered the 12oz filet mignon $29 for my entree. The two pieces of meat that I received was no way a filet mignon. They were each about the size and width of a deck of cards. When I ordered, I thought I was getting 1 big slice of filet, but was very disappointed when I got these two little skinny pieces of meat. They were so thin, that it was more like top sirloin rather than a filet mignon. The filet mignons I purchase at the butcher are from 2 1/2 to 3\" thick and super tender.   It was our anniversary and I didn't want to make a big deal out of it so I just ate what I could of the overly cooked meat and went on to enjoy the rest of our anniversary.   Needless to say, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat at night. Large menu and cocktail list. The apps are awesome. Decent prices. Good Atmosphere. Nice bar with fireplace."}
{"text":"Our first time, we got the tuna poke for an appetizer which was very good. I got the Pittsburgh salad & my husband got the lamb shank. I didn't realize the salad came drenched in salad dressing, I assumed it came on the side. It was good except for the dressing (and there isn't anything Pittsburgh about Cesar dressing-it was way light on the fries compared to a true Pittsburgh salad but that was a good thing) my husband enjoyed his dinner but said  it was mild, he prefers his lamb with a stronger flavor. The place was beautiful & huge, that's why it's never full."}
{"text":"The food is spectacularly delicious. The Kale Caesar is phenomenal.  The presentation on the romaine Caesar is divine. The roasted chicken is flavorful and generous. The Shrimp and Grits are heavenly. They were out of the strawberry shortcake and Apple Walnut cobbler. Disappointing, with an early seating at 6:30 and an half empty restaurant. That's the reason for only four stars. FYI...the bread pudding is rich.   So bring your appetite but be patient."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place! Initially we thought it was closed, because when we walked in it was completely empty! It's a huge restaurant and it's very nice and elegant. The hostess Etem greeted us and promptly offered us a table. Moments later our server Etem arrived and took our orders. The bartender Etem served up a delicious Sangria which is 5$ on Monday's. Their lunch menu is perfect offering a wide variety of options from salads to flatbreads to ribs!    We ordered the Grilled Pork Chops and the Steak & Frites which were BOTH delicious! The chops were cooked perfectly! Juicy and tender, as was the Steak. The food runner Etem assured that our food arrived nice and hot!   I hope Etem is compensated generously for his multitasking abilities and professionalism. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I had an amazing experience at Alton's.  Our server, Keenan, was exceptional and attentive.  He made our experience wonderful and eventful in additional to the delicious food!  We will absolutely fine here again, and we hear they have an amazing brunch!  Excited for that!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten in Alton's twice.  It is very close to my house and it is in a restaurant that has turned over many times.  The interior is TIRED.  They tried to make it look new, but, it is the same basic design from \"Charleston Chops\" with some new paint.   The reason this review gets two stars instead of one is because of the cocktails.  They are good.  The food is just OK.  It is really not great.  The tuna app, (which we think made us sick) was just scary.  The ribs were OK, the \"New Orleans\"style shrimp dish was served over the most sticky white rice I have ever had.  It was bad.  I was sad when I ate here the second time and it was worse than the first.  Save your time and money and go to 131 Main.  These guys did not do a good job opening a restaurant that even compares.  I am a stay at home Mom and a foodie and I know good food.  This is not good food."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and other than their Queens feast menu, there is really nothing on their regular menu that is all that great. They do have an excellent raspberry lemonade martini!"}
{"text":"I attended a Girl's Night here a little while ago during restaurant week. The food and setting was lovely, but unfortunately later that night I couldn't keep it down. I'm always a little apprehensive to go back to places once I've had that experience, but given the other Yelp reviews, I may need to try again. For now, it's off my \"must-do\" list."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise . Loud but the food was very good. Lobster bisque was very rich and solid-- a dollop of mashed potatoes sounded weird but cut into the richness of the soup and made it just right. The swordfish was cooked to perfection and the prime rib was tender and expertly prepared. The strawberry shortcake was yummy too--loved it all !"}
{"text":"I have had many good meals at this restaurant over the past nearly two years.  It is ashame that someone would post a review like HBN did which has nothing to do with the food but simply with the fact that HBN was trying to get away with something.  When you buy a Groupon you know there are restrictions and should be aware of them.  I have purchased many Groupons and know what I can and cannot get with it.  Of course, the only other restaurant review by HBN also was a negative so maybe that means something."}
{"text":"We chose Altons last night because they were participating in Queen City Feast.  It was delicious.   Three of us ordered Filet Mignon.  They were all cooked perfectly.  The mashed potatoes and asparagus was delicious and perfect portions.    One order of Prime Rib.  She said it was the best she's ever had.  One ordered surf and turf.   She loved hers tooo.    The appetizers, shrimp cocktail and prime rib stuffed mushrooms were spot on.    We can't wait to go back.    Ask for a server named Reagan.   She was fabulous !!   A note too about the atmosphere:     Great atmosphere, spacious seating.   We didn't feel rushed either !!"}
{"text":"It was a rainy day and already felt like I should've turned back but we were excited about the menu. Came in and although no one was by the entrance a waitress far back saw us and then came back around to greet us. We decided on a table and sat down. They had a half price bottle of wine special tonight so that was good.  Diana was excellent. She took care of my mis order and spoke to the manager on my behalf. I would def come back."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch, I ordered chicken and waffles. Food took a long time to come out to the table. Waffle was cold (sigh). Perhaps it would've tasted better if it was warmer. Anyway bf ordered the braised lamb - it was scrumdiliumcious! highly recommend it. The cheese grits are also the bomb! Will go back again and hopefully be served warmer food. Stay tuned....."}
{"text":"Just in case you have a hard time finding the place, the parking lot can be kind of hard to find via GPS at night. Alton's Kitchen was very nice looking inside and the food was great. I made the mistake and ordered my steak wrong. Without missing a beat the server quickly fixed it and apologized (even though I told them it wasn't their fault). Overall I enjoyed my visit and if you are looking for someplace nice Alton's Kitchen is a great choice."}
{"text":"Decent, upscale neighborhood restaurant near Lake Norman serves up good fish tacos, salads and other entrees in a pleasant suburban shopping center. The ambiance is ideal for either a business lunch or a casual dinner -- elegant and classy without being too uptight. I can't say I'd make a special trip here from South Charlotte to eat, but whenever I'm back in Cornelius, it'll be on my list."}
{"text":"Another restaurant I was so looking forward to trying!! Decided to make a reservation for restaurant week- $35 for the queen's feast meal. Thursday night- looks packed from the outside!! We walk in - it's very warm inside. I understand it's hot out- but I did want to cool off a little!! So I get past the heat and notice half of the tables are empty- the bar is packed!! Hmm. So I order, filet and mashed potatoes. The food was served in a way I would expect from a hotel convention. It was served in a very hurried manner- and then a cold steak!! No!!! But what really got me- the mashed potatoes were partially instant. The distinct taste of instant mashed. Yuck!!! Our server was sweet- poor thing probably over heated!  I am so sad to say this is another fail---"}
{"text":"Decided to try Alton's after hearing so many positive reviews. Went for hubby's birthday celebration  We had the pleasure of trying the delicious Kale Caesar salad and Prime Rib Stuffed Mushrooms for appetizer. Lucky for us the Shrimp and Grits entree was being offered mid week! We were told by our waitress this is not the norm and they usually only offer this dish on Sundays. Can I just say I have never been a fan of Shrimp and Grits because most versions are fishy tasting. Wow this is by far the best take on the dish I have ever tried, delicious! Just wish the portion size was a little bigger because it is so good you need some for leftovers! We also ordered the Salmon with Green rice, another delicious meal. The salmon was perfectly prepared medium and the rice infused with cilantro corn and tomatoes just yummy! Topped everything off of course with the delectable  white chocolate bread pudding. Hints of cinnamon vanilla subtle white chocolate tones topped with glazed pecans, OH MY GOODNESS!"}
{"text":"Been going to Altons over 131 for over a year now. Sunday & Monday half price wine and really good brunch. The app specials everyday are awesome. Wish we lived closer but I77 keeps us land locked in mooresville most days"}
{"text":"The Sunday Brunch was disappointing! I've had the chicken and waffles in the past was very good. It was not good today. Th chicken was not crispy it was soggy. They sent it back and replaced with another order of soggy chicken. The waffle was under cooked. The manager seemed to be bothered when she brought out the replacement chicken. On a previous visit my friends salad greens were wilted. Not as good as they used to be!"}
{"text":"Came here during queens feast and got 3 course meal for $35. Good food. Appetizers meh I got the prime rib stuffed mushrooms. Steak was great and desert of white chocolate bread pudding very small portion. Service was great in the beginning but our waiter became distant & hard to find towards the end.  Martinis are okay-$10! Got the employees only - basically a margarita in a martini glass."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start with this place - there are so many things about it I appreciate and really enjoy.  For starters, there is always a nightly special that is tough to beat.  I think it's usually around $14 or $15, and you get a beef, chicken, and fish option, served with a side salad or vegetable and a scoop of ice cream for dessert.  Sounds pretty simple, until you order it, and realize it's a big enough portion to feed you for dinner with leftovers for the next day.   If you want to be the only thing 'special' at the table, and choose to order off the full menu, there's no shortage of options.  Although the wait staff touts the prime rib, I've found it to be just ok.  What seems to stand out the most are the fish dishes.  I always order some kind of beef or pork entree, but my wife always orders fish, and just about every time, hers is slightly better than mine.  Make no mistake though, mine is excellent as well, but good ole' Alton knows how to cook some fish it seems.  But you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  If you can save room for dessert, go for the Key Lime Cheesecake.  You won't want to even chew it... you'll just want to stick it in your cheek pouches and keep it there for hours so the taste doesn't go away. As for service, I've always found it to be excellent.  My wife recently went to Alton's with a friend of hers, and they had a negative service experience, which was a first.  After recognizing the mistake, Alton's staff went above and behind to make my wife and her friend happy again, including comping the meal and an additional bottle of wine.  On a different occasion, my wife left her wallet sitting on the table, and Alton himself called us to coordinate the pickup.  I honestly don't know how he balances taking care of customers personally while also maintaining such a top notch restaurant."}
{"text":"I used a Groupon to test this Resturant experience, Alton has great atmosphere, but if you are seated upstairs, coming back down with heels or a full stomach might be a task.  I menu is a bit pricey and most items are à la carte.  Service is great, but you pockets might be empty when you leave...enjoy"}
{"text":"I've had a few meetings at Alton's and have enjoyed dinner at the casual bar area.  I like that the menu has a great mix of items for dinner.  I can go get a steak if I'm feeling fancy or a steak sandwich when I want a less fussy steak.  Ha.  They definitely have better wine picks than beer picks, but I tend to be pretty picky about my beers (and my wines).  Great mixed drinks too!  I wasn't crazy about the fish tacos but everything else I've had there has been on point.  The white chocolate bread pudding is highly recommended.  Yummy!  All in all, a very nice place to have a drink with a few friends at the bar area or patio but also a great \"nicer dinner\" type spot."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good! Service very much needs to be improved. We waited over 20 min just to get out check! Probably won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! Lobster bisque is awesome. Prime rib stuffed mushrooms with wonderful horseradish sauce was great. White chocolate banana pudding was out of this world. Great service! Absolutely zero complaints."}
{"text":"Awesome spot, big place so you don't have to wait long to get seated, if there is a wait at all. Always get the ribeye and twice baked potato, it's killer! I always forget about it because it's tucked away!"}
{"text":"Incredible menu, beautiful bar, gracious service, quality food!  Great chef/owners.  We love having our small company's holiday party on the mezzanine level which is cozy and gives a bird's eye view of the bar downstairs."}
{"text":"Alton's Kitchen and Cocktails seemed to have the best menu for Queens fest so I chose them to celebrate my parent's anniversary. The atmosphere was really nice and it wasn't noisy. They even had a couple other large parties. The food was delicious. I ordered the Lobster Bisque and the Filet Mignon. The mash potatoes in the bisque are an added treat. The Filet hands down was the most tender filet I have ever had. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Alton's is located in what was once Charleston Chops, and the building is updated, but still richly appointed.  It has, most notably, two flowing staircases at either end of the restaurant, which while beautiful, did become tiresome watching harried servers race up and down all night.  Maybe a dumbwaiter and a server or two just stationed upstairs?  When we were seated, a waiter immediately greeted us and brought us a carafe of water and took our drink orders.  They actually had \"sweet tea\" which I commend them for because many nicer restaurants only offer unsweetened tea.  The only comment I can make that may leave room for improvement is that the water could use some ice.  Our appetizers were delicious.  We ordered Lobster bisque, tuna poke and shrimp cocktail.  I had the shrimp cocktail, and it was truly one of the better ones.  They used Jumbo Shrimp, and they were perfectly poached, not too chewy.  They served it with two sauces, a typical cocktail sauce and a tartar sauce.  They were both tart and tangy, but I preferred the typical cocktail sauce.  Both my diners proclaimed their appetizers to be delicious.  Not an appetizer, per se, but my friend and I wanted to share it for our appetizer, so the restaurant kindly split it onto two plates for us:  the Crab and Shrimp Louie.  Tender seafood atop mesclun adorned with sliced avocado, tomatoes and topped with a homemade creamy and tangy 1000 Island dressing.  It was delicate, but very satisfying.  And very fresh.  For our entrees we all got something a little different.  Robert got the Slow-cooked Baby Back Ribs served with chili lime grilled corn and creamy cole slaw.  The spicy and smoky sauce on the tender ribs had a wonderful kick.  The corn was also wonderful, with a tang from the lime and a deep savoriness from the grilling.  Harry ordered a Crispy Chicken Salad.  It was loaded with fresh avocado, rich eggs, bacon and draped with a creamy thick homemade Ranch dressing.  Dick got the seared ahi tuna.  It was seared lightly and crusted with sesame seeds.    I got the grilled swordfish on cheese grits with lobster gravy.  Honestly, the fish was really firm and not my favorite texture, but that wasn't the chef's fault.  That is just the nature of the swordfish.  It had a nice chargrilled flavor.  What I LOVED was the cheesy, creamy grits that this fish rested on.  I'm not sure I've ever had better grits, even in Charleston.  The lobster gravy was lighter than you'd think, but still creamy and flavorful.  No chunks of lobster, though, which did disappoint me somewhat.  Laid across the top as a garnish were grilled asparagus spears, and they were wonderful, just cooked enough.  I made a meal off of the grits and asparagus.  Dessert was a bit of a fiasco.  We enjoyed homemade Oreo ice cream sandwiches and bread pudding.  The cookie sandwiches were delicious, topped with chocolate sauce and best eaten with a spoon instead of picking it up with your fingers.  My bread pudding was merely ok.  Nothing special, I'd opt for something different next time.  (taken from my review on my personal blog)"}
{"text":"So we went here for Christmas Eve dinner with family. We showed up on time for our reservation. We were told that their were multiple large parties so we had to wait. It was clear that there was a lot of confusion. We sat down an hour and fifteen minutes later and they all but ran out of food. The food we did get was of high quality, and the wait staff was very polite even though I am sure they were stressed out. The only thing they did for the \"long wait\" was give us 1 complimentary vanilla ice cream.  Poor management and a clear inability to handle what in reality would be an average night at the Palm or Mortons."}
{"text":"My husband and I chose Alton's Kitchen for his birthday dinner this year and we were not disappointed!  The location isn't terrible, but it isn't exactly easy to find.  The decor is nice, but  the lighting is poor the restaurant borderlines on dim/dark.  The wait staff is very friendly and kept our glasses full throughout the meal.  I had the roasted chicken and it is quite possibly the BEST chicken I have ever had!  The skin was coated in seasoning/herbs and the meat was moist.  As a side I had a twice baked potato which was to die for! The mashed potato insides were creamy and flavorful.  My husband had the yellow fin tuna and succotash which he said were both delicious.  For both of our meals and a glass of wine it was about $60, which is great considering the quality of  food.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place especially because of the high prices and high recommendations from friends.  But it was horrible.  Maybe they were having a bad night, it was a Friday night and not busy at all.  The spinach and artichoke dip was watery with what we believe was frozen spinach.  It was served with tortilla chips, sour cream, and salsa- not something you'd expect from an upscale dining restaurant.  I had the salmon which was drenched in so much sauce you couldn't taste much else.  The green rice it was served with had a nice flavor but came out cold.  My husband got the prime rib which he said was okay.  His mashed potatoes were also cold.  We decided to skip dessert in order to not continue wasting money on sub par food.  Such a disappointment and waste of money.  It was a great atmosphere and had potential, but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm settling back on three stars.  Alton's has updated their menu, and while they do some things well, there are several issues that we can't ignore.   The good - * Comfortable bar with ample seating, and a cozy fireplace during cooler weather. * Smoked trout and salmon - The trout is served as part of a dip trio, but you can also get a smaller portion of just the trout.  The smoked salmon is only served occasionally as an appetizer.  It's absolutely delicious, and we ask if it's available every time we go. * My husband has even several of their specials, including the crispy duck and BBQ platter.   * Their white chocolate bread pudding is topped with carmelized pecans, and is just divine.  The not as good - * The main dining room is very dark.  Hence, we prefer dining in the bar or outside. * In general, we're not impressed with their entrees.  Several of our entree favorites from the menu have been removed, like the shrimp pasta, scallops with cheddar grits (a Saturday staple), and fish tacos.  Items that are off our list are the salmon (too sweet), trout (a bit bland), and the lobster roll (too much filler and too greasy).   * Avoid the ranch dressing at all costs.  It's sweet and just plain awful. * Most of their martinis and specialty drinks are well-sized and amply filled.  The pear martini used to be my favorite, HOWEVER, during my last visit, it was so ridiculously sweet, I couldn't drink it.  While it was obvious I wasn't drinking it, my server ignored that elephant in the room, and I was out $11 for a crappy drink.  Never again.  Overall, I waffle on my love for Alton's, but I'm currently on a down cycle.  I might consider returning once they update their menu again, but not likely before."}
{"text":"Ventured over to altons yesterday for the second time ever- and we were surely pleased!! I had been craving a lobster roll after having a delicious one in charleston. Although I wouldn't say the lobster roll was the best one I've had, it filled the craving! I think this is something super hard to impress me with as I'm from the northeast and all, but it wasn't bad. As for the appetizer, our table shared a dippy egg flat bread that was absolutely amazing, and I heard the lobster bisque was delicious! My husband has a burger and said it was pretty delicious too. Th service was great but the food did take a good while for only being brunch and the downstairs of the restaurant only being 3/4 full. I will be back to try more!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for an early dinner before we caught a movie. The atmosphere seemed a little dark and eerie so I wasn't sure what to expect. After sorting through the menu I decided to try the Lamb Shanks. It just seemed fitting in the dungeon-esk setting in which we were dining. I also noticed the bread and honey butter... I love honey butter so I had to get some. It would have been nice if they would have cut the bread for us but instead we were forced to try and saw through this brick ourselves with minimal utensils (the honey butter was quite good though). The lambshank was decent, not the best ever, but good nonetheless. I really liked the mash potatoes that it was served with - kind of heavy - but that's to be expected.  All in all Alton's Kitchen is A-OK. There's definitely potential here but for the cost I doubt I'll be going back for a while."}
{"text":"Good Restaurant, Love the Kale Caesar!!! Great Cocktails too!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and very friendly waitress. The hostess could use some work on basic greeting like saY smile?  The food was amazing and creative and flavorful The french toast was more dessert like and left me shocked at how yummy it was....  The place can satisfy your hunger no mtter the time of day"}
{"text":"I always appreciate it when an owner or partner response to a review good or bad! And that's exactly what we have here: My first trip to Alton's was not so great, but Heather (Partner) emailed me a day after my review and asked me to come back so they could make it right!!! After a few weeks I was able to make it back in and I am so glad I did! The service and food were great - And I wanted to personally thank Jessi and the staff at Alton's for their efforts! Below was my original review:   Went in for lunch around 12:50 on a Friday and the place was mostly empty... That should have been a clue to turn around. But I was happy to have the bar to myself and be alone with my phone. I started with a margarita and it was very tasty (kudos +1 star).  I asked the bartender how was their burger, she said \"best one in town\" - ok, I love that kind of enthusiasm! So I ordered that with a side salad...  My lunch can and I noticed that the cheese was still cold and unmelted, but I thought the meat would do the job while I ate my salad. Unfortunately it was still cold several minutes later, so I asked the bartender about it. She mentioned that's the way it came so it doesn't melt away (or something like that...). So I waited some more to give it time and noticed that the tomatoes in my salad were not cleaned (ugh -1 star). Appetite turning the wrong direction, on to the burger than... Cheese still cold, I flipped the two halves together and the meat was flavorful but over cooked (-1 star). A few bits in my appetite completely escaped me and I pushed the plate away... After mentioning this to the waitress earlier it should have been a clue to take some portion off my check, but instead she asked if I wanted a box to take it for later...   Note to self: go for the margaritas..."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new restaurant with  my mom in town so we made the drive out to cornelius. Altons is a very nice restaurant  tucked  inside a shopping plaza. I made a reservation for 7:15 but we made it there quicker than expected but were seated 30 minutes early without a problem.   We had the steak stuffed mushrooms, pittsburgh salad and shrimp w/ angel hair pasta. Everything was delicious. To drink we had a big day and the lemonade with vodka. Our server was quick, responsive and did a great job checking on us without being intrusive.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with my husband tonight. I had the shrimp and crab salad. Oh, my, I surely enjoyed it. It had avocado, good sized shrimp, sweet crab meat and hard boiled eggs. My husband had a steak that he enjoyed. The restaurant was very clean. The waitress was very attentive and pleasant. There is a large bar area where you can also eat, besides the main dining area. We will be going back."}
{"text":"We tried Alton's for January Restaurant Week and picked Saturday, the 23rd, the day after the ice storm.  The restaurant called to confirm our reservations earlier that way and the host staff was prompt and personable.  That was the best service we got that night, unfortunately.  The walkway was pure ice.  The restaurant was nearly full, they had a great turnout in spite of the weather.  We were seated directly outside the wine \"cellar\" at the base of the stairs.  We were greeted promptly by our server and asked what we'd like to drink.  I asked for 1 more minute to peruse the drinks menu and she said ok.  And never returned.  I tried to catch her eye for the next 30 minutes but she seemed to be purposefully not looking at our table each time she walked by.  After 10 minutes someone brought us water, we thought it was a back waiter.  After an additional 20 minutes that same back waiter/front waiter came by and offered us a cocktail.  Finally.  (30 minutes for a drink???  Not good).  Another 10 minutes went by and she came back to see if we'd like to order.  If you're counting, it took 40 minutes for anyone to ask us if we'd like something to eat.  Once our food orders were placed the food came out quickly.  One of us ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was straightforward.  I ordered the Prime Rib Stuffed Mushrooms - three cheese & horseradish cream stuffing, $10 on the regular menu.  It's one of the reasons I chose this restaurant, I was intrigued.  The mushrooms were generously sized, it was a large enough appetizer to share, for sure.  The mushrooms were stuffed with prime rib and cheese.  I wanted to like it but it was a little too greasy and heavy for my tastes.  I should have realized that cheese, cream, beef and butter was going to be a little much.  My husband ordered the Homemade Lobster Bisque - dash of sherry and a unique whipped potato garnish, $6 on the regular menu.  It was delish.  For dinner I ordered Surf & Turf - cold water lobster tail, tenderloin of beef skewered and topped with Worcestershire-herb butter, I think it was $27 on the regular menu.  The first bite was yummy... all buttery and salty and beefy.  Then I tried the asparagus.  They were huge, the size of my thumb, I kind of prefer skinny asparagus.  The first bite was yummy... all buttery and salty and asparagus-y.   A bite of lobster followed and you'll get the point, it was all buttery and salty and...  Yeah.  Everything was swimming in butter and salt.  It tastes delicious the first time but it's a trick for your tongue.  You crave salt and you'll keep eating things that are heavily salted.  These nice filet mignon tenderloins and lobster tail and asparagus and mashed potatoes didn't need but a tiny dash of flavoring but they were swimming in it.  They deserved better  :/.  My husband ordered the Braised Colorado Lamb Shank - with Cabernet jus, $24 on the regular menu.  I asked him his thoughts and he liked it but didn't care for the large asparagus stalks or heavy butter.  Dessert was Warm Apple Cobbler for all four of us.    At the end of the day, Alton's has a great reputation, but it's not for us.  Our experience with a server ignoring us for over 30 minutes was enough to decide we likely wouldn't come back.  I got outstanding service last night from a smaller place for the same price and if I'm spending money, I don't want to sit ignored and cocktail-less."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful on the inside and it has a great ambience for a perfect date night. They were offering a three course holiday menu for $33/person so we were able to sample a lot! The lobster bisque and oyster Rockefeller were fantastic appetizers. I had the surf and turf: the lobster had great flavor but the filet skewer was a little charcoal on the ends and my husband had prime rib which was cooked perfectly. We also were able to have a dessert each and of course, dessert is always good!"}
{"text":"Been several times, great/unique food items. Solid wine list. Excellent large bar with fun drinks."}
{"text":"Ok I rarely post reviews but they are so consistent with all of the dishes...surf and turf, lobster bisque, cocktail shrimp and the white chocolate bread pudding, oh and the pear-martini... you have got to try Alton's Kitchen and Cocktails."}
{"text":"This place is really great, the food is absolutely fantastic, they have meat, fish, chicken dishes...salads, sandwich....you can order a bottle of wine....the portions are big and they also have a variety of appetizers....plates are around $15 to $30...so it's not cheap...but it's worth the $$$!"}
{"text":"The place was close but I have had better burgers elsewhere. The place is quite large and has a nice beer selection but I don't think we will be going back. Just expected more."}
{"text":"I just was not impressed with our brunch here unfortunately despite everything on the menu sounding so good.  Biggest disappointment were the popovers, a favorite of mine in general, and one of the main reasons our hosts took us here.  They arrived dry, hard, and bland, no light fluffy/airy goodness to be found.  The main courses fared a bit better, my husband's blt Benedict looked great and my chicken and waffles were a nice change of pace. The waffles didn't do much for the dish though. I mostly ate the fried chicken and honey mustard portion of the dish.  With so many restaurants in the area I don't think I'd make a huge effort to come back when visiting."}
{"text":"Best filet mignon I've ever received from a restaurant! Definitely will be going there again!"}
{"text":"For this Father's Day I decided to take my parents to Lazy 5 Ranch (see prior review for that), so logically we needed to fill our bellies prior to. Turned out trying to find a decent brunch spot was not easy in the north Mecklenuburg area. I have been to Alton's once before for brunch and glad to find out they were serving regular menu and not a highly priced brunch buffet option like everywhere else (think Red Rock).  The menu is well priced for the ambience. It is definitely better than just a breakfast spot, which was my other alternative. The place was not that busy considering it was a special day. Overall service was ok. Our waiter got assigned a big table next to ours and he didn't appear to be a multitasker. We asked for a minute to look over menu... I had to wave him dowm to place our order. Good thing we were not in a hurry.  The menu offers a little of everything. We ended up with a chicken and waffle, which was with fried chicken fingers, and came with 3 strips of bacon, it was tons of food for $10. Shrimp and grits ($13), the grits was a little thick instead of being creamy and the gravy had an odd taste of tartness. Finally a chicken club sandwich ($10) that had a big piece of chicken breast, name and bacon with a side salad. I had myself a mimosa, which I was happy to see it being served in a regular wine glass and not some tiny bity flute.  It was a lot of bang for the buck, and overall the food was decent. A solid option for a nice brunch up in Lake Norman."}
{"text":"My s/o and I came here on Saturday evening for restaurant week. So this review is strictly an experience during restaurant week!  This place is tucked away in the back of a little center, very quaint type of feeling. We had made a reservation of 1900 and was seated immediately by the host on the second floor. The setting is very classy, romantic, sporting high ceiling and chandeliers, candles at every table. This is perfect for a date or some sort of anniversary.   We first both got stuffed mushroom for our appetizer. It was savory, flavorful, and well seasoned. The cheese was sooo gooood. A little on the heavy side but what do you expect with those ingredients.   For entree I got the home smoked salmon and s/o got the braised colorado lamb shank. Both entrees came with a side of asparagus and mashed potato.  The smoked salmon had this honey sort of glaze, it was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. It literally melted in my mouth, it was so delicious! It was done perfectly, and I would consider ordering it again if there's a chance. The lamb shank was a bit different than I expected. I expect lamb to normally be a bit on the gritty side, however this was very tender. It lacked a bit of flavor and a bit too bland for my taste, but the portion was so big! I was super surprised.  For dessert we got the white chocolate bread pudding and the oreo cookie ice cream sandwich. The bread pudding was yummy, portion size was perfect, but a bit sweet. It had walnuts though so I had to pick them out, (allergies), just FYI for those with nut allergies. This was pointed out on the menu but we wanted to try both of the desserts out. The ice cream was delicious, but the syrup was too overwhelmingly sweet for me. Overall the dessert fell a bit flat for me.  While majority of the meal was enjoyable, a few things bothered me. Something about plating and plate size. I'm not sure why if the restaurant only has one sized plates but when my entree came out, the plate was obviously too huge for it. Also, the plating for the oreo ice cream was so off and there was like syrup spots toward the edge of the plate, I don't think it's difficult to clean that off with like a napkin...  A server (though it might have been a host), brought out someone else's dessert and set it on our table, when I corrected her, she removed it from our table but then brought it over to the correct table. personally, I would have liked if they had taken it back to the kitchen and got a new set for them. While we didn't touch it, you never know what someone else might have done to that plate, plus that's just good food service etiquette."}
{"text":"Update:  We came back here last night to celebrate our second anniversary. We really enjoyed the meal we had during Restaurant Week and we were now ready for the full experience. It definitely did not disappoint and only reaffirmed Alton's as our favorite place to go for a \"special\" dinner.  While the appetizers sounded tempting, we opted to get some salads instead. They are a pretty huge portion and definitely worth the price ($5 extra to add it to an entree.) The miss' got the wedge again and I tried the ceasar. It was up there with some of the best ceasar I've had. The dressing had that spicy kick to it that I simply adore in ceasar.   For dinner the miss' had the ahi tuna which was cooked perfectly rare. They served it with a nice slaw that really complimented the fish. I went for the ribeye, and man was that one of the best steaks I've had in years. It's a nice thick chunk of meat (most ribeye are thin and lame) with this extremely light brown sauce on top that is simply heaven in each bite. The steak came with a twice baked potato that I can't even begin to describe. It was potatoey and creamy and spicy all in one bite, and was a heck of a side.  For dessert we shared the key lime cheesecake. It's basically a cheesecake but infused with lime, and that citrus really takes away the heaviness of the cheesecake and makes it feel like you're eating a much lighter dessert than you actually are.  The salads were great, the meals were excellent and the dessert was simply amazing. Alton's really is one of the most tastetacular dining experiences you can have in the Lake Norman area."}
{"text":"I have been planning on trying this place for a while and finally  came by recently  for brunch . The place was nicely decorated and  cozy inside .  We tried an appetizer , which I believe was new to the menu of crab Fries . It was composed of shoe string fries , lump crab meat and thousands island dressing . It had a very interesting taste and really could be a entree as it's quite filling . Next up was my chicken and waffles , the chicken and waffles  both had good flavor , but they could have been crispier . The batter on the chicken  would sort of slide off . Overall I  would give them another try , maybe for dinner ."}
{"text":"So, over the years, I've reviewed Alton's three other times with a 4 star and two 5 stars and according to my app check-ins, have dined here at least eight times.  Then comes this...  We were looking for an early Friday evening dinner and decided that Alton's bar would be a perfect choice.  We arrived, were greeted promptly by the hostess and seated at one of the tables in the bar.  As we were seated, a server was checking on the table next to ours and gave us a nice welcome.  Then we sat, and sat, and sat, and sat and.... Well, you get the picture.  No menus, no waters, no nothing.  For the first 5 minutes there was only the bartender behind the half full bar and no other staff coming into the bar dining area.  Then came a flurry of at least 3 different servers checking on other tables, bringing out food, etc. with not one word spoken to us.  The final straw was the server who had welcomed us as were being seated checking on the same table where he had welcomed us and then turning around and leaving.  Leaving.... That's what we did as well.  Literally 10 minutes without one bit of attention paid by at least 4 staff members in the area at different times during that 10 minutes.  Unacceptable.  In case management wants to have a word with folks, the date was December 5 and we arrived about 5:45 PM."}
