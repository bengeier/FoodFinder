{"text":"I will never spend a single cent in this establishment because they use the extortioners \"Wheel Blockers\" - do not park and enter this establishment if you do not want your car booted and to be treated terribly by shady characters."}
{"text":"This is on my way home from work and had decent reviews so I decided to check it out for dessert since I have a huge sweet tooth. First time I got some cheesecake and some sort of chocolate cake. Nothing memorable. I like Rich chocolate cake and this was not such. I must go again I thought. Surely a bakery that is supposedly this popular must have good desserts. But no, second time I got a brownie and some carrot cake and was again disappointed. Still trying to convince myself this place had potential I tried it a third time and got a lemon meringue pie. Terrible. Lesson learned finally and I'm staying away from the desserts. I have heard the bread is delicious so please note this review only covers the desserts."}
{"text":"I love the variety of baked goods and pastries... the cookie I tried was delicious. However, not thr greatest coffee I have had, but I am picky with coffee ;-)"}
{"text":"I popped in on a whim to grab something for breakfast. The chocolate croissants (pain au chocolat as I know them) are of the best I've had in this country, Highly recommended.

Service was great too."}
{"text":"First time stepping foot in there, and I was greeted like family. Melissa, was so nice a sweet to my daughter when she couldnt decide what to get! We will be back."}
{"text":"Great little place with a nice vibe.  Very friendly staff.  Good place to hang while my wife was getting a facial across the street."}
{"text":"Popped in on Saturday morning. Staff friendly pastries delicious. Got a spinach feta scone and a chocolate croissant with chocolate along with coffee."}
{"text":"I like the idea of a more homemade, small shop that sells fresh bakery and coffee. However, I have to say that their bread and other bakery items are mediocre. I've had bagels, croissant, and some artisan breads from here and they are all HARD. Coffee is not as good as Starbucks....."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a bite yesterday when I really didn't have time for a sit down lunch.  Had a spinach feta scone that was very dry.  I won't be going back.  Employee was very pleasant, however, so I will give it two stars."}
{"text":"When you get tired of the crowds of Amalie's, check out Nova's Bakery.  Their pastries are delicious and their hot drinks are great.  They also have great fresh bread, a large wall of whole-bean coffee, and lots of interesting wine.  Plus it's 24/7 which is perfect for folks like me who work unconventional hours."}
{"text":"Raspberry turnovers are good. The loaves always mold quicker than bread I have bought at other bakeries."}
{"text":"THE worst brownie we have ever tasted in our lives. I brought it home and used it as a sponge to wash the dishes. The girl behind the counter seemed annoyed. \"I have to wait on a customer AGAIN?\" was her vibe. I thought Nova 's had a great reputation, which is why we stopped in at the Central Ave. location. Never again."}
{"text":"I just love this place. It is the perfect replacement for the Laurel Market. Southend definitely needed a spot like this -  coffee, open 24/7, wi-fi, friendly staff and fantastic baked goods, both sweet and savory."}
{"text":"Dangerously good and shockingly cheap. It felt like I ordered every item on the menu and walked out paying $15!!! The items are baked fresh everyday and the l;eft over breads are sold discounted the next day (french toast anyone??)! Best thing of all it's 24hrs!"}
{"text":"Brought home a selection of pastries. The whole family agrees-worst walnut brownie ever (Im still surprised at how bad it was) flavorless coconut cake, flavorless princess donut. Considering they are a bakery-yikes. Very disappointed. Maybe their coffee rocks?"}
{"text":"Wanting something sweet at the end of a fun filled night of drinking and saw Nova's Bakery on the way back to my friends place. My friends from Charlotte said it was hit or miss. Went with a brownie and the wife with with cheese cake. Both were very tasty and   even that they were about to close the guy working counter was is no rush to get us out the door. I also got a variety of scones for breakfast that were also very tasty."}
{"text":"We had a really odd experience last night when the girl at the register told us our card was declined as a joke. After allowing minutes to go by of us being a little panicked and trying to figure out what was going on with our card, she smiled and said \"Oh, it went through, I was just messing with you. I do this all the time, you should see people's faces. I used to work at McDonald's and do this all the time there, too.\" How inappropriate! What we got to eat last night was good, but not worth someone trying to embarrass/prank us."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of independent coffee shops and this place does not disappoint, it has a really nice vibe, definitely somewhere i would sit and read for a fee hours, great selection of desserts and fresh bread, something that's getting tough to find these days.

Please support local Business by coming here instead of the Einstein's next door."}
{"text":"I was craving something sweet when I came across Nova's. We got there 10 minutes before they were closing, and the lady behind the counter was super sweet. I got the chocolate cream pie (amazing) and baklava also amazing! What had me was the vanilla iced chai! Believe me when I say this was simply delicious and must say nothing compares to this!!"}
{"text":"NOVA'S BAKERY
First time I've ever been to a Serbian bakery. The baked goods include everything you can expect from a typical bakery, including cookies, croissants, bagels, cheesecakes, freshly-baked breads, etc. We bought the cranberry walnut loaf, which was excellent! Best of all, it's open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"New location of central ave favorite. Great glorious morning muffins loaded with apples, cranberries, carrots, etc. Tiramisu, Danishes, canolis, cheesecake, and more."}
{"text":"This was my sister and I first time visiting this bakery. I purchased Baklava and red velvet cake, she purchased baklava and carrot cake.  The cakes were NOT sweet at all, my sis asked if it was a no sugar/ sugar substitute bakery. We couldn't even tell it was iced with cream cheese, it was flavorless. If we were blindfolded we wouldn't have been able to identify the cake flavors. The baklava was ok, we have had better."}
{"text":"This review is only for the pecan sticky bun and the country sourdough bread loaf. I wasn't greatly impressed with either. The sourdough did have a nice sour flavor but was too dense and hard. The sticky bun was good for the few bites with the syrup on top, but the rest was bland and doughy with not enough filling. 

The guy behind the counter was very helpful and friendly. They have free wi-if and are open 24 hrs. Seemed like a nice place to hang out if you're so inclined."}
{"text":"Really bad service. Really bad baked goods.
The lady at the counter not only got a very simple order incorrect - but was incredibly rude, never even looked at us."}
{"text":"AMAZING tuxedo cake and breads. Family owned and operated. Half of the breads served in Charlotte restaurants are from Nova's! Wonderful bakery, with a laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am only giving four stars because they did not stuff the canolli enough. Could have easily been a 5 star.  So much empty space that could have been filled with creamy goodness. But a really really good canolli.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nova's is like that ex-boyfriend who treated you like crap on a regular basis, but you kept going back to him because he was, well, available. Well girl, pick yourself up by your bootstraps and forget him. You can do better. 

Oh wait, we're talking about a bakery. Right. I didn't give them a great review before, but it's gotten not only worse from a product standpoint and the bread/pastry products are terribly dry (seriously, they only have 3 decent food things - almond cake, paisano rolls and morning glory muffins) but primarily from a service standpoint. In case you didn't know, the bitchy boys are way more important than you and smugly will yell at you for several reasons, but especially if you try and help yourself to coffee beans. Hello? If you don't want self service, put it behind the counter or don't put out the bags! That's kind of a retailing basic.  The coffee is good, but not good enough to get the sh!tty treatment we get at Nova's. EVERY TIME.  Even hubs who works across the street agreed convenience is no longer enough to get him back. It's worth the drive to Dilworth Coffee, Central Coffee or Not Just Coffee. They're available, they're cuter and will treat you well."}
{"text":"Went in for a coffee but ended up getting the Glorious Morning muffin as well. It was the first good decision I made this morning to start a wonderful day! It was so moist and fresh I gobbled up the whole thing in no time. It also kept me full for a few hours, which is rare for me. I never write reviews for restaurants, but this muffin was so good I felt compelled to share. Definitely recommend Nova's bakery!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Nova's for coffee and bread for a while. Their coffee is beyond average good, but I have to give a shout out to their bread - just outstanding value! I just got the garlic focaccia a moment ago and tried a piece - everything about it was just on point! The garlic and rosemary was strong but not overwhelming; you can taste the olive oil through the moist texture but not feeling greasy at all... What can I say, a loaf just for a few dollars with absolute great quality. A solid five star bakery!"}
{"text":"Nova's Bakery is such a great neighborhood spot for a yummy cup of coffee and pastry. They have the best chai tea lattes in town! I also love their bagels and chocolate chip muffins. You can tell that everything is fresh. The staff is always super nice and helpful! 

I love coming with friends on the weekends and enjoying the outdoor seating- much better local alternative than Einsteins Bagels next door :)"}
{"text":"Can't attest to their pastries (yet), but without a doubt they have the best vanilla chai tea latte I've had in my life. It's super creamy and not too spicy. Get it with soy milk and it's even better. Wayyyyyyy better the SBX."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee- Mandy actually knows how to make a perfect dry cappuccino! And they have introduced me to a Dirty Chai Latte for those days I want tea but need espresso! The staff is super friendly and I can't say enough for their breads, scones and muffins. So glad this location opened-so convenient and a nice alternative to the chain coffee shops!"}
{"text":"The strawberry shortcake was absolutely perfect. Light, balanced, and delicious! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"All I had in my mind was a perfectly flaky croissant, but Nova's didn't exactly deliver.  The croissant was okay, but not necessarily flaky.

I also purchased a loaf of french bread but was a bit disappointed as well.

I like that this place is open 24 hours a day and that they have parking, but if I can, I think I'd choose Amelie's over Nova's."}
{"text":"I cannot speak on their baked goods or coffee but Nova's has the best bread in Charlotte hands down! I have tried many of their breads, paisano, french baguette, 8-grain, and whole-wheat. By far, the whole-wheat is my favorite. It is rare that you find a bakery that creates a whole-wheat bread that is really whole-wheat and contains no added sugar but Nova's has perfected the art of creating a crusty and hearty bread and I am always sad when I run out. Every time I go I try to buy two loaves so I can freeze one but I find if you don't go early enough Saturday/Sunday mornings than run out! But you can't stop a delicious bread from being bought...so I will learn to share :). Seriously, once you try their bread store-bought bread will taste like dirt. It cannot replicate the texture or taste of bakery baked bread. The staff is always friendly, I do wish though we could tip on the iPad while using a credit card on the days I do not have cash. You can always tell this place is loved by Charlotte residents as every morning I go there is a couple, or a family eating right in front and people constantly getting coffee and baked goods to go."}
{"text":"I suggest everyone sign up for shifts around the clock to go in and make purchases since they are one of the only places open 24/7 in Charlotte. Not that I'm a 2am regular or anything (haven't been that way since my early 20s), but I truly appreciate late night businesses and wish Charlotte had more around-the-clock options. 

My schedule is a bit backwards, I typically work late and so having the option of getting a fresh pastry to end the day is a treat! The main bakery is in Plaza Midwood off of Central. However, the items are made daily and sent to this second location. 

I'm definitely a cannoli snob and I can confidently say theirs is pretty yummy! They have one of the best carrot cakes by the slice...and let's not forget their \"Glorious\" muffins! They make it all fresh. 

They offer free WiFi and have select seating...mainly countertop looking out onto the street. 

It's definitely a nice addition to South End...be wild and act young, I dare you to make a purchase after midnight!"}
{"text":"Best chai latte in Charlotte. You can snag day old breads, muffins and scones for a killer deal or spring from fresh made. Can't miss red velvet cookies or cannoli.

Outstanding olive spreads as well and usually ample samples to wet your appetite. Hands down delicious scones. Services can back up during peak hours but support local business y'all. Also, at the regional farmers market on weekends. Get there early. They sell out."}
{"text":"They have some great chai lattes. Amazing taste. Their almond cake is to die for so rich and creamy. It was once a 24x7 open but I think they close by 10/1030 now. The barista keep changing quite often and so the taste of beverage differs at times. But tastes great most of the times. They have fresh bread and it's tastes great. You can also find their fresh bread in grocery store like Harris Teeter. Love the place."}
{"text":"I'm a coffee addict, but I've only ever gotten ice chai teas from here. They are hands down the best chai teas I have ever had. They are amazing! 

Tip- order the iced vanilla chai tea with soy  it will change your life or at least your view on chai tea for a minute...."}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful addition to the exciting Southend neighborhood! I have been here a handful of times at various times of the day. I am always greeting by a friendly staff who are smiling and happy. This bakery is open 24/7 which is awesome for those late night adventures.  There loafs of bread are always fabulous and very reasonably priced. The pumpkin spiced latte is out of this world!! Get it. I love hitting this place up on the weekend and sitting outside with a latte and scone just watching the people go by. If you have not been, definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love this bakery best in Charlotte. . I start every morning with a red eye made from Tanja. .. The worst thing I have ever gotten from novas was diabetes. Five stars for novas.."}
{"text":"I tried about 7 different flavors of cakes, and their cannoli. What I liked about all of them is that they are not super sweet. They are good!"}
{"text":"Coffee is good, Chai Latte's are awesome! I have tried a few different breakfast items and they were all great.  It seems that they are now settling in after being open for about a week.  They didn't have the espresso maker up and running right away and they were out of some of the different varieties of items.  However that all seems to have corrected itself in the last week.  Weither stopping in for breakfast or for coffee and dessert after dinner you will have plenty to choose from.  However please remember they are a coffee shop and bakery, I was in there the other day around lunch and there were quite a few people coming in looking for lunch type items which they do not carry.
Lastly and what makes this place is the girl that works behind the counter (wish I had gotten her name).  She has been in there everytime I have gone (4 times in the last week) and she is always happy and cheerful.  Greets everyone with a smile and is patient while you try to make the difficult selection of what you will try that day.  
Keep up the great work and I will keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"There are several locations of Nova bakery scattered throughout Charlotte. I stopped in for a sweet bite recently and decided to indulge in their walnut brownie. It was a chewy type of brownie. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"My friend and I are in town for the weekend and we wanted to grab coffee and dessert. We were lucky this place is open on New Years Day.  It has a very low-key, comforting vibe. They have a great selection of cakes and pastries. Both their iced and hot coffee are good. My friend had the baklava and enjoyed it. I had the red velvet cake (real cream cheese icing, appropriately moist). The staff who took our order was nice."}
{"text":"Over the years that \"Nova\" has been in town, I have cheered for her, the self-taught baker, and for her company to succeed. I lobbied Harris-Teeter to carry her baked goods, and they did for a while, but finally decided on the frozen dough La Brea franchise. At this point, the coffee is the run-away winner at Nova's. This is good, but it's not why locals would want to support a local bakery. Their sweet items are decent, but they don't offer real baguettes. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguette) The batards they do offer are sealed in a knotted plastic bag which is of course death for the texture and crust. Their ovens are not hot enough and are not steamed so the crust and rich, beautiful complex browning is completely missing; the batards come out white with a bit of tan color. The instructions indicate warming in a 375 degree for 2-3 minutes. Oh, well. It was to be a bakery after all, not a coffee shop, but whatever works is OK. It *is* a great place for coffee."}
{"text":"I stopped in after dinner with my husband for a treat and selected strawberry shortcake and an apple bread loaf to take home.  We shared the strawberry shortcake in the car before going home and it was very good. I have to say the apple bread tasted even better than it looked. Since both items we selected were good, we would return in the future to try something else."}
{"text":"We stopped here late one night on a whim. We were taking a walk around the neighborhood and noticed the bakery was still open. We stopped in to pick up a treat. As we were looking at the bakery case we noticed that there was a day old bin. I love the day old bin option! It's a great way for bakeries to get rid of product and a sweet way for customers to save some dough -- all puns intended. We picked out a bag of two cinnamon rolls for $2. 

We had to pay in cash because there is a credit card minimum. Not a fan of credit card minimums. 

The breads there looked good and a few of the other treats did too. 

It's a small shop, it felt old. I couldn't really see myself sitting there and eating a treat. It's more of a to go option. 

The cinnamon rolls were good - but not the best I've ever had. 

I'd like to go back and try some other baked goods. When I do, I'll review again."}
{"text":"We definitely need more 24 hour places in Charlotte, I'm gettin' tired of studying at Amelie's, for real. Nova's is just aiite to study at, mostly because of the coziness of the place. The cashiers are friendly and the location is super convenient for people on this side of the city. Their breads are delicious and the desserts I've tried aren't too shabby either. The prices here are decent and they have several coffee options. 

Yay baked goods!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the muffins! I got the muffin with raisins, carrots, pineapple and coconut and oh my gosh!!! Best muffin I've ever had! It was huge, but I could not stop eating it. Delicious flavor and great texture! Definitely coming back! I wish I could recreate this recipe at home."}
{"text":"I like this location as an easy stop on the way to work. Good coffee, great chai lattes. The muffins are huge and mostly good (especially Glorious Morning) and the scones and bagels are very good. The breads, though, are a bit stale. Not sure why, given the bakery is supposed to receive freshly baked items every day. Oh well. Service is sometimes friendly and sometimes not."}
{"text":"Great bakery! How do I know? I've tasted their products before I even visited the bakery.  There are quite a few sandwich shops that use their products!! Finally got to visit the bakery. Yes, it's a bit small, but it's packed to the rafters with fresh bread, croissants, scones and any baked good you can think of!! Got a loaf of Paisano that made awesome toast the next morning!! Nova's rocks!"}
{"text":"Baklava is phenomenal!! Moist and just the right amount of sweet, goodness for less than $2"}
{"text":"This second location of one of Charlotte's very own is a nice addition to the neighborhood and fills a niche with it's 24/7 'round-the-clock schedule.  While nothing besides the coffee and lattes are made on premises, there are a good amount of breads, muffins, and treats that are available.  At least everything is made locally, however.  Some items appear fresher than others, so it never hurts to ask the staff when your intended purchases were made.

The inside has been nicely brightened up and features a couple of small tables and bar seating that faces out onto busy South Boulevard.  This would be a good spot to meet up with a friend or co-worker to just catch up before moving on to bigger adventures.  While there are a meager two parking spaces in front of the store, there are a few more around back.  This is not usually a problem unless you visit during the morning rush with the bagel store next door.

I do quite like their muffin selection, especially the 'Glorious Morning.'  It's like a carrot cake in a breakfast muffin and usually has a nice balance of moisture and flavor.  Not too sweet either.  I am also a fan of several of their loaf breads, made in a more European style, with crusty outsides and creamy interior textures.  Baguette is available here too, but I find it a bit lacking in comparison to other local offerings.

I've not tried most of the sweets here, so I'll leave that to others, but they sure do pack the display cases full with a seasonal selection.  There is never a worry you are getting 'the last one' of just about anything they have.

In all, I'm glad Nova's is here and I am glad someone else has the courage to go for the 24/7 schedule that is so lacking in our city.  For that alone, it is worth a stop in and a sample of what they have to offer.  Supporting locally-owned business?  Well that's worth another stop too."}
{"text":"I love Nova's Bakery.  My favorite things to get are the chocolate tuxedo cake and tiramisu. For about $3.00 a slice, it is worth every penny....so rich and just yummy. The staff is always friendly and  the atomosphere makes me nostalgic and I begin to miss my college days of studying in cozy coffee houses."}
{"text":"Nova's Bakery has been supplying Charlotte with baked goods since 1996, and a few months ago Nova's expanded their operations to include Nova's Bakery Coffee Shop in South End.  The 24-7 bakery and coffee shop serves hand crafted coffee and espresso beverages and baked goods straight from their mother location in Plaza Midwood.  They have a wide variety of fresh baked breads on hand, including sour dough, focaccia, and olive bread, plus bagels, muffins, and scones.  The coffee shop also offers an extensive selection of sweets, including cookies, cakes by the slice, and filled-to-order cannoli.  I can personally vouch for the walnut brownies, which taste especially good when warmed up at home and topped with hot fudge and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Just sayin.  While the coffee shop is small, there are a handful of tables and ample workstation seating with plugs and free wifi.  For a real steal, check out the half-priced day-old baked goods rack.  Nova's is a fantastic addition to South End, but there is one negative.  Even with all the delicious fresh bread they have stocked, they don't serve sandwiches.  Did I mention they're open 24 hours a day"}
{"text":"We found the BEST cannolis at this bakery. We tried both the chocolate dipped and the plain and they were awesome. I also tried a chai tea latte and it was great. The customer service here was also fantastic. We went back another day and had their cheesecake and it was also fantastic. It's also nice that they have their own parking lot."}
{"text":"SugarLESS \"Desserts\" is what it should be called. I was excited to try a new bakery because my sis and I love sweets! However, we were disappointed with the purchase. I got Carrot cake and Baklava my sis got Red Velvet and Baklava. The cakes were no where near dessert worthy. I asked my sister if this was a sugar free bakery because she's the one that found it. The Baklava was just ok. Won't be going back here."}
{"text":"Enjoying a nice cool and breezy end of August morning with a craberry scone and organic jasmine tea #novasbakery #charlotte #southend #dilworth
A great way to start the day!  
Might have to go back in for something else! ;)"}
{"text":"Novas Bakery booted my car while I was standing with cookies and receipt in hand.  Management would do nothing even with receipt. Horrible parking policy.  Owners responded rudely & were unapologetic of their unclear signage.  Be warned you must remain on premises or they will boot or tow with NO warning.  The cookies weren't that great either."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat a late afternoon sweet snack. Got on Yelp and found this bakery... And it was great! The service was really good, and the food... Oh my god hahaha we had brownies (chocolate and marble) we used the microwave, for 30 seconds and the brownies tasted even better! The best treat you can get for less than 3 bucks! Loved it! I just missed the bread but i will come back to buy some."}
{"text":"Love their coffee and enjoy coming to work here but there is one girl who mans the counter who is so incredibly rude it'll make me think twice about ever going back."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of pastries!  They have a Tiramisu that looks delicious.

Their Gingerbread Man is nice & dense & ginger-y!

Their have canister coffees as well as specialty coffees they make behind the counter.

Friendly staff, clean store & a couple of tables to sit outside.

All in all a nice little stop in."}
{"text":"I tried the spinach-feta turner (scone) and I was not a big fan. It needed more flavor. I kind of wish I tried their danish or other pastries which looked good. Sorry this is not a good review as I only went there once while I was in Charlotte for a very short stay!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and baked goods. It's nice to have a local place like Nova's in Charlotte (and Rock Hill)."}
{"text":"SCONES. Do yourself a favor and go buy a scone from Nova's RIGHT THIS MINUTE. I am a carb-o-holic and have tried almost everything they sell. I thought I'd struck gold with the Glorious Morning muffin, which is so tasty they're almost always sold out :( 

But then I tried a scone. Heat it in your toaster oven for 5 minutes and you will be biting into the butteriest, flakiest, most delicious scone ever. Just the right balance of flaky and sturdy, not too sweet, and lots of sweet and savory flavors to choose from. This is honestly the best scone I have ever had. Plus the prices are great and the staff is always friendly.

Why are you still reading this? Get thee to Nova's for a scone, stat!"}
{"text":"Went for a afternoon snAck. Brownie was my choice.... So disappointed, It was CAKE! Not good. I was so excited about having a brownie...it wasn't even close. Gave it away"}
{"text":"Great bakery with fast service. Went an hour before closing, most selections were out. However, the tiramisu was devine! The coffee robust and reasonably priced. Highly recommend to satisfy your sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about Nova's Bakery. This location is fairly small but there coffee and pastries are very good. It can get busy on weekend mornings. The server we had today was very friendly and enjoyed speaking with her. 

It was the perfect place when craving a brownie this afternoon! Easy to get in and out of."}
{"text":"A 24 hour place in Charlotte! And a Nova's at that! I've been a huge fan of their baked goods since they opened in Charlotte and I'm delighted to see not only a second location, but a round-the-clock bakery/coffee shop (Sorry, Amelie's...$3 and a 10 minute wait for a one-bite confection is not my bag).

The dessert case is well-stocked, as are the bread baskets and bagels and rolls. Even though the bakery itself is in Plaza-Midwood, I've not experienced any issues with freshness at this location. Delicious and flavorful, especially the challah and the marble brownies. The cookies will tempt you, too, so be warned. The coffee is fresh and there are several varieties and flavors to choose from.

The interior is small and you can tell it's an old building - most things in that part of town are, and I feel like seeing glimpses of what the space was before add character. The staff was beyond delightful, especially since it was late night that we went. Very happy and talkative - I felt like I was visiting a friend who was happy to see me.

I hope this location does well - they know what they are doing and Charlotte needs more than one or two quality 24 hour spots."}
{"text":"I will not be able to support this bakery anymore. It's sad, really. Their prices (especially on the day old products) are very reasonable, and a couple of the girls that work behind the counter are pretty cool. Notice how I wrote \"a couple,\" though. There are two other girls who have personalities that are not suitable for customer service at all. In fact, I had the misfortune of interacting with one of them today. 

Once again, my coffee was FILLED with grinds. (I have taken a photo that will hopefully upload.) This seems to be a frequent problem, despite making suggestions on how to brew when dealing with a large wire basket (tuck the filter into the wire so the water pressure didn't fold it over). 

Today's barista actually acted like it was completely normal to have \"a few\" grinds in the coffee. Bottom line, it's NOT normal. It's completely disgusting. It's also not good for the GI tract to ingest such quantities of coffee grinds.

There's a new bakery on South Boulevard about three minutes up from Nova's - some fancy French place, Renaissance something or other. I think I will start visiting their location instead."}
{"text":"I love this place. The coffee is perfect and the blueberry muffins make me pee a little they're so good. I had a gingerbread cookie this morning and it didn't make it home. The spinach and cheese scone is off the hook too. It's got a great local atmosphere and the people behind the counter are super friendly.  It's just a perfect spot. They are dog friendly on the patio and even have a bowl of water out. A must go place."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? It is a total dump now. Service suck big time. Second time in a row, different people, different days. Both unfriendly, however, today's service totally made me decide to never come back. The Americano tasted like water, I asked for a larger cup because I like to put a lot of milk in there, but instead the larger cup got filled up to the rim. There are no prices on the pasteries, and the place is dingy and dirty. The tables are sticky and it is only 10 am. And the prices are too high for such bad service and dirty place. Ob top of that they ran out of pennies (early in the morning) ). I used to love it here, but even Einstein Bros next door sounds now much better. This was my last time here. I wouldn't be surprised if others feel the same way."}
{"text":"Stale baked goods. Heard they have good coffee but haven't tried it. As far as the baked goods, you really should go somewhere else."}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood, decided to walk to Nova's for a little sweet treat after dinner. Lots of yummy options, I decided on a piece of baklava and a brownie with walnuts. Staff was friendly, I made it just in time as they now close at 8pm on Sundays (not the listed 10:30). Took my goodies to go for a small treat when I got home. Baklava is yummy, although I enjoy it with more nuts typically, very traditional flaky, sweet goodness nonetheless. The brownie is dense, but not overly fudgy. I'll definitely return, but try different items next time."}
{"text":"I have always liked this place, first location that I ever tried and used to come all of the time!! Haven't been in so long, but need to get back soon.  

The shop is very tiny, but friendly and comfortable.  I enjoyed many of their coffees and coffee drinks, but they started using Hershey syrup...which I loathe in my drinks..so I quit getting them.

The service is good.  The pastries, breads, and treats are all good.  Never a complaint when it comes to their foods.  Very fresh."}
{"text":"We saw this bakery (actually a different location was featured with the owner) featured on Eden Eats and added it to our list.  We were in Charlotte for a conference and, even though we already had breakfast, on our departure morning we swung by to check it out.  We found friendly staff and a wide variety of baked goods to choose from.  I don't even remember what we had but everything was delicious, especially the Princess Donut that also came with a story that it was used in the film Hunger Games.  We will be back anytime we are in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I think Nova's has the best iced espresso drinks in town.  The bakery items are ridiculous.  The bran muffin is my personal favorite.  
Not a lot of seating so I would suggest taking your coffee/sweet treats to go. Friendly service, great coffee, and endless sweets!"}
{"text":"Sensational. The baked goods you get here are nothing short of fantastic. Way better than generic pastries you get at other coffee spots. They are made here in Charlotte fresh every day. Also very sweet workers :)"}
{"text":"I have heard mixed reviews about Nova's and still wanted to give it a try for myself before I made any conclusions. It was mid-afternoon when I stopped in, so I wasn't expecting the freshest product, but surprising they had a lot of items out still. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and it is a relatively small place. I was browsing, trying to see what they had to offer and what made my taste buds water. I had asked the employee a few questions and he didn't seem to have all the answers, but he was able to search and find them for me. I settled on a sesame bagel and a Chai Tea latte with a splash of vanilla. He sliced my bagel and was about to ready to cash me out when I asked if he could toast if for me, and he pointed to the toaster behind me. OK, not a huge deal, I am capable of toasting my own bagel. Then he asked if I wanted butter or cream cheese and I said yes to cream cheese, and then my total went up. 50 cents isn't a big deal, but for a bakery, I would have expected to have my bagel toasted and cream cheese included for me. The toaster out for use is just a regular toaster that burns the seeds and doesn't really toast because the bagels are too big. The bagel itself was average, not bad, but not the best I have ever had either.  There also was a fly buzzing around, which again not a big deal, but skeeves me out when the bread is out in the open. I would give them another try based on I know they have recently opened and are working out the kinks I'm sure, and my Chai Tea Latte was AMAZING!! It was so good that it was totally worth the trip there. Chai Tea Latte for the win here ladies and gentleman."}
{"text":"Too bad you can't give zero stars or even a negative....Breakfast pumpkin pancakes were disgusting and not entirely done! This is my second visit here and its merely because its next door to the nail salon, but thus far I haven't liked a single thing."}
{"text":"I might have set out to Nova's with too high a bar set for my expectations. Or maybe I went at a weird time, close to the end of the day on a Thursday. Who knows! It was a nice enough place, but it was a bit dirty, and there were a lot of little critters around. Generally, I prefer my pastries without a side of ants and flies, but maybe that's just me. Or maybe it was the slightly-too-hard sticky pecan bun I had. Who knows.

I really wanted to like it, and I do intend to give it a second try. But for now....eh."}
{"text":"Loving this new location! (Though I do miss Laurel Mkt)

Delish breads, lots of coffee options, friendly staff, I'm in. The two behind the counter were still getting a grip on the pricing and fighting nerves as the line began to grow, but in another week or so I'm sure they'll be a well oiled machine.

I'm mostly familiar with Nova's rolls/loaves/savory breads, but for breakfast I tried the spinach/feta scone - so good. Their filled croissants are pretty yum too. We took home a lemon bar that was different than most I've had/made (more custard like), but it hit the spot later that evening. I look forward to frequenting here for all my breakfast and bread needs! 

(and they've been doing some bogo specials - I've seen pastry and baguette offerings on the a-frame outside, so I'd definitely check it out!)"}
{"text":"Let's make this nice and easy

Pros:
Reasonable price
Open 24/7
Friendly staff

Cons:
Over-hyped
Some items tend to be stale (blaming this on management for still having items still on the shelf)"}
{"text":"Quiet in the afternoon when I stopped in, I chose a spinach and feta scone. The seating is good and they have a couple of them with a power outlet to enjoy your baked treats with their free wifi. The scone was definitely too dry and crumbly (more so than a scone should be) that had lots of spinach but not much on the feta side."}
{"text":"I ordered a pumpkin pie last minute 3 days before Thanksgiving and they rushed and got it done for me. This was my first time ordering anything from here so I was really hoping and praying that it was going to be great. 

The pumpkin pie was a huge hit at Thanksgiving, everybody loved it and said that it was the best pie they've ever had. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"This may be backlash due to all the hype I have heard about this place, but it wasn't particularly amazing.

I got a loaf of white bread and Challah bread.  Both were slightly dry and stale (maybe I was unlucky).  I also got some baked treats, which were good, but nothing stood out.  I would walk an extra couple of blocks to go to Sweet Lorraine's for treats.

As far as service, one person was really friendly and one was slightly edgy and impatient, so they canceled each other out.  Net score = 0.

Bottom line is that there is nothing drawing me into this place.  I would be just as satisfied going to Teeter for bakery bread. Although it is open 24/7, so if I needed some late night hard rolls, this may be the place to go."}
{"text":"The baked goods here are just okay. I wasn't impressed with the cinnamon roll I got. It was around 11am and it was hard and dry and not as fresh as I'd expect that time of day. The iced coffee was pretty good and I appreciate that they have almond milk. I'd stop in for a coffee if I'm in the neighborhood but certainly wouldn't make a trip for the baked items."}
{"text":"I visited Nova's Bakery for breakfast on a Saturday morning.  While Einstein's Bagel's was packed next door, Nova's had little wait.  Come on Charlotte!  Support your local place!

I took a bit to peruse the offerings and then settled on an apple cinnamon muffin and a vanilla chai tea.  The muffin was huge.  The apple and cinnamon flavors were spot on and the top had almost a crumb cake consistency.  I had been picking pieces off the muffin before I eventually got to the center.  There was a \"surprise\" inside. The filling was like a cream cheese/apple pie filling combination.  Honestly, I didn't love it.  The rest of the muffin two thumbs up though.

The Vanilla Chai tea was awesome.  Delicious flavor with just enough sweetness and warm flavors from the chai.  Delicious.

I'd return to Nova's next time I'm in the area."}
