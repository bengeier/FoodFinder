{"text":"This is not a real sports bar. Do not be fooled. They have plenty of TVs, but they do not play the sound for the games, rather they prefer to pump in adult contemporary music. When we asked about turning on the sound for the Rose Bowl, we were told that they only play sound for important games. There were no other games being played on any screen in the bar or restaurant. We were seated in the bar area where every patron around us had their eyes glued to a silent Rose Bowl. Apparently to the management the inaugural playoff game in college football and the 112 year bowl tradition is not considered an important sporting event. DO NOT visit this establishment if you hope to watch an critical game. You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere but mediocre food.  I tried the signature panini and was disappointed - I'm not a huge coleslaw fan so it pretty quickly transformed into a dry turkey sandwich.  And the fries were undercooked.    On the upside there are a lot of TVs and a pretty decent beer selection."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed and I don't intend to visit this location, or any other Panini restaurant again. So slow!!!!  It was dead. Only 4 groups were at the bar and 3 tables.  Drinks took 15+ minutes each, so if two people ordered two of the same drink at once, one will come then you will have to wait all over again. FOR THE SAME DRINK?! Why not make two at once? And if you make two separately, why not make them back to back? Manager doesn't care at all. He told me he understands my frustration and will speak to the bartender. I asked him to see what he can do for me and in exchange he gave me a $10 off your next visit certificate. I will never eat there again and will discourage anyone else from eating there."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, helpful and knew the menu. The overstuffed pastrami sandwich was very good, exactly like I remember at my first visit to  Panini's years ago.  Lots of screens for sports, fun environment.  Party of four all ate for under $40.  I have been to other places and have gotten much less for much more.  Love the location and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great weather, great patio, fast & friendly service.  Too bad the over-hyped, not so\"over-stuffed\" sandwich didn't Match up with the rest.  The cheesesteak panini didn't taste bad, there just wasn't that much to it.  Bread and slaw dominate.  A miserly amount of roast beef.  A half- dozen fries in a single layer.  And then I discovered.... Yes! A shaving of white cheese ( maybe Swiss?  Not enough to taste or identify).  This is not the sandwich that I fondly recall devouring downtown after a night of beer consumption.  Too bad...."}
{"text":"Yuck.  Nothing really redeeming about this place.  If my rep takes me here again we may need to look for new help."}
{"text":"Those famous overstuffed sandwiches were pretty tasteless. I wouldn't get them again."}
{"text":"They have keno- me likey. Food not too bad for your typical Paninis bar food. Usually just get wings n spinach artichoke dip- mainly just go for keno -"}
{"text":"I've always been a little suspicious of this local chain which claims to have invented the overstuffed sandwich (newsflash: Primanti Bros in Pgh started selling these in the 1930's) but I was pretty excited to see a new restaurant move into this abandoned corner of Solon.  Restaurant has decent decor (for some reason all new sports bars in Solon seem to have black paint inside) and a nice outside patio. Some of the outside tables face a nice bar and flat screen tv's, but we had a view of the gas station across the street and the parking lot.  Anyway, this place was pretty crowded, so even though we were standing in front of the hostess stand, we did not hear or see them trying to call our names, nor did the buzzer work. Super slow service continued throughout the evening, although we had chosen Panini's in the first place so we could sit outside and enjoy one of the first nice summer nights. So, it wasn't terrible when it took 30 minutes to bring the appetizer and another hour to bring our entree's. We elected to try their version of the Primanti sandwich (stuffed with fries and slaw) but after an hour started to wonder if they were indeed driving to Pittsburgh to get our order.  My other friend ordered a turkey burger w/ guacamole. Sounds good in theory, but it wasn't fresh guac, just the unimaginitive kind you might buy at the Giant E. Come on, Chipotle does a better job! And their chips are not stale and their salsa is freshly made!  Our drinks were decent tho pricey, and came with a few LOLs as our could not possibly be over 18 year old server kept recommending her favorites.  I might try this place again in about 6 months. It's super crowded at the moment as any new establishment in Solon seems to get mobbed at first. Hopefully they will be able to get it together and rise above their dollar-store quality!"}
{"text":"They made me go so made THEM regret asking me! (plus my blood sugar was low and a good enough excuse for embarrassment ~!~) Anywho... got the ff with cheese and bacon, pretty good!!! Sammiches... I got corned beef on these freaken SLABS of bread, funny thing? I got like 6 slices of corned beer! LOL!!! I kid you not!!!! Co-worker got turkey I think and it was the same thing!!!! like 6 pieces of turkey on these boat pontoons doubling as slices of bread!!! The service was pleasant and prompt... can't give 3 stars....The sandwiches just weren't up to snuff..."}
{"text":"Worst paninnis I've been to. Unfriendly service. The place smells like spilled beer. The wings were not very good. The stow paninnis is much better"}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday, midnight celebration of my 21st and bartender didn't know how to make half of the cocktails on their beverage list."}
{"text":"Their famous sandwiches are disgusting.  I've never understood putting soggy french fries on what started as a semi decent sandwich.  Stick with beer, drinks and appetizers as those are OK .  The staff does a good job and service is friendly.  There is usually a few very inexperienced newbies, but the bartenders make up for them.  The rest of the menu is pretty typical for a sports bar.  They tend to want to do a lot of items just OK instead of less but better prepared food."}
{"text":"Realistically speaking, what is the difference between Paninis, Winking Lizard, Fox & Hound or any of the CLE \"happy hour\" spots?  All of them offer decent happy hour deals, but at least the Lizard gives you popcorn & edible food.  This \"overstuffed\" sandwich would probably have been better had I prepared it in my kitchen with my own ingredients.  Ultimately, too much coleslaw dominated the sandwich & soggied the bread.  Worth getting a beer here, but don't expect much from the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a complete train wreck.  The servers were unfamiliar with what beers or glasses were available.  They all seemed very sleepy and annoyed with any request.  This is a SPORTS BAR and we were told we could not get sound to a game we were watching.  We were forced to listen to country music when there were only a handful of people in the place.  It's a beautiful sports bar in a great location, but could really benefit from a management overhaul!  We'll visit another location."}
{"text":"I had to wait way too long to order a sandwich, I waited at the bar for at least 5 minutes before being recognized by a person at the bar to place my order.  After placing the order I waited 20 plus minutes for a sandwich, c'mon a sandwich please."}
{"text":"This panini's is not really much different from all the others. The food is decently good for bar food. My favorite thing is their boneless wings and all the sauce choices.  My most recent visit here was for my lunch break and I ordered the Santa Fe wrap. Since I am not a big fan of their chips or fries I got a side of vegetabls.  The wrap was really good and they stuffed it full of chicken, lettuce, guacamole, and cheese. They up charged me for the veggie side and they were not good at all. They were literally frozen veggies from a bag that they didn't even season. They had no flavor and considering they require an up charge for this side, you would think they would serve a good amount of veggies but it was a small cup with more cauliflower then anything else. I will not be ordering those again.  They also do not take discover so make sure to have another form of payment."}
{"text":"This review is compatible with all the panini's. WTF. seriously why do people go to this chain. The food is bad... the service is worse.... Hot blonds with big boobs do not a good place make. The one in solon is only busy cause there are like two restaurants in solon."}
{"text":"The worst Paninis ever, always dirtying, staff is scarce. When the staff does get to you they are rushed. All pointing to poor management."}
{"text":"had the stuffed sandwich and thought it was pretty tasty.  it had cole slaw, french fries and an inch thick bread.  i was able to eat half of it and had a side of onion rings with a yummy dipping sauce.  there was lots of tvs for the guys.  would return."}
{"text":"The food is decent. Not a big fan of wrap and salad here. They have very good chicken parmesan though."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here, but this has been our go-to bar to finish the nights off. The drink prices are reasonable and the bartenders are friendly. For Solon, I certainly think it's the best drinking option... but that's not exactly saying much. The real problem is that there are ZERO taxis around here. We wanted to go downtown but were told that it would be an hour wait. There's no excuse for that. FWIW, they had $2 draft night on Wednesday, so at least they have that going for them."}
{"text":"This was my first visit at this Panini's, and while it resembled every other I've been too, I don't see that all the negativity is about.  My husband and I brought our 2 young boys here on a Saturday afternoon and we all had a blast.  The greeter was very friendly and quickly seated us.  Our waitress was also very friendly and very attentive.  I never had to wait for a refill, and most importantly, she was very attentive to my children and always made them happy!  She always was ready for refills and talked with them.  If my kids are happy, then so am I!  Our food was brought out steaming hot and in a reasonable amount of time.  We didn't wait long, and that is saying something on a busy, Saturday afternoon!  Everything was clean and neat, and while I didn't use the restroom, my husband and kids reported the males restroom to be decent and clean.  Overall our experience was wonderful and I would be more than happy to recommend this place and come back in the future."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar.   Food was ok nothing to write about really.-Kind of bland. Lots of tv's to watch various sporting events.  Great beer selection and decently priced. Bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Panini's is a chain that for years I associated with cheap drinks and even cheaper clientele.  Yet, here is Solon, they pulled together a cleaner, sporty location.  Plenty of sports fan TV; comfortable bar areas; two different patios.  And, they still offer some of the cheapest drinks in Solon.  Good place to catch a game.  I've had two different pizzas, and both were surprisingly very delicious.    I'd say I'm pleasantly surprised by this Panini's. It seems to fit the Solon community."}
{"text":"DJ ON SATURDAYS WILL MESS YOUR EARS UP!!! TURN THE MUSIC DOWN. The servers are always super nice but the music is killing the mood. It's good music. It's just way too loud and the DJ refuses to turn the music down!!"}
