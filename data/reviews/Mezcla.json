{"text":"We really enjoyed the food, as expected, so I will base my rating of 4 stars on the  food experience. If you're looking for inspiring cuisine, you simply can't go wrong here.  However, my night was marred by the tall dark bearded waiter who was clearly trying to maximize our bill. He first told us emphatically that it's \"impossible\" to share any dishes as they are not conducive for sharing - we soon discovered that all dishes could be easily shared.  Then, after recommending a more reasonably priced wine, he presents a more expensive alternative (I vividly recall seeing it at the bottom of the list), explaining this bottle would be more appropriate for the dishes we ordered.    We left having really enjoyed our meal, but with this unfortunate taste in my mouth of being had. shame, really. Please don't let the above comments discourage you from visiting - just be on the lookout for that guy and hope his colleagues don't employ the same tactics."}
{"text":"Ma femme et moi avons adorré. Non avons pris l'option 5 service. Chacun des plats nous a plus. Une bonne doce d'épicé! Notre serveur a fait un travail impécable."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful in all respects! The food was delicious, the servers extremely polite and attentive. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Montreal"}
{"text":"Awesomfulleness! This is numero 1 for me in montreal Great in all the ways  First time i had this new latino cuisine. What a grea mix"}
{"text":"The room is clean and inviting, though the layout was a little awkward for us - even though we were sitting in close proximity to the next table, we were also separated from the rest of the room by the structural pillar abutting our table. The open kitchen in the corner is exciting (I love watching people prepare food) but seemed a little inconvenient as well. There are actually 2 passes (one the counter of the open kitchen, the other the counter that also serves as a door to the other kitchen in the back.) The chefs sometimes had to move back and forth to plate dishes and waiters would pick up at either pass. I only mention this because we were seated right next to this area, and as a result through the night could witness some of the little stumbles in flow between the kitchens and the servers.  The menu was exciting and short; no more than a dozen appetizers and four mains the night we visited. I'll note in passing that not every dish really screamed \"nuevo Latino\" (especially among the mains), but we didn't really care.  Everybody at the table thought their food was delicious; I had crispy duck and foie gras bao (descriped as \"arepas\" on the menu but definitely Chinese steamed buns). For a main I had the smoked/braised bison short ribs with seasonal vegetables. The desserts - we shared pouding chomeur and a warm chocolate volcano cake - were simple and very tasty. The flavors were really excellent in everything I tried.  The only negative comment I'd include is that the kitchen is so clearly interested in unconventional plating (the crispy duck / foie gras buns were served in an open Chinese bamboo steaming basket) that it can detract from the food. My main course would have been better in a more traditional presentation. The short ribs and the vegetables were presented on each side of a rectangular cutting board, so that a clear cloche could be kept over the shortribs, into which the cooks pumped smoke just prior to service. A nice idea, except that having the shortribs on a flat, rimless surface must have discouraged them from serving more sauce with the meat (which would really have elevated the dish - bison is quite lean and this dish threatened to seem dry), and in the time taken to present the dish with aromatic but quickly-dissipating smoke the vegetables on the other side had cooled to room temperature. Presentation has to work with the main attraction to make it shine, not trip it up."}
{"text":"Wow! Most wonderful date night! We loved the ambiance (modern rustic with unique artwork by one of the owners), great service, unique menu (modern South American/ Japanese fusion best described the flavours for me) with a modern beautiful presentation of each dish. We had the tasting menu + the Ceviche with a champagne based cocktail to start and shared a Spanish imported white wine to go with the meal, all recommended by the waiter. We asked LOTS of question to the Chef (we eat out a lot and found some really unique items) some dishes were inspired from childhood street food, some just of his own creativity. We found out some cool tidbits like they hydroponically grow their micro herbs themselves and the tidbit about the art (above) We chatted so much he even came to sit with us at one point :() Loved every minute, we are looking forward to going back and recommending to friends."}
{"text":"Tried the 6 course tasting menu and every item was delicious! Great balance of flavors and textures. Service was friendly and efficient. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am a New Yorker and everytime I go to Montreal I hit up Mezcla atleast twice during my stay... I am a vegetarian and they always surprise me with something insanely delicious that is made specially for me. They have a wonderful staff that is extremely professional. The best thing I find about this restaurant is that you can not get their food anywhere else, the flavors are completely exclusive to the team of chefs that work the kitchen. The desserts are to die for as well! Definitely one of the best restaurants Ive ever been to... Its also in a great location and has a very cool ambiance!"}
{"text":"Mezcla is, without a doubt, the best restaurant in Montreal's Gay Village and one of the very best new restaurants in the whole city. The decor was rather bland, but the wooden bar and open kitchen in the back did give the place a nice warmth. The food was, in a word, excellent. An innovative mix of modern latino cuisine and local Quebec ingredients. Very reasonable prices, including wines. Don't let the sometimes classic dish names fool you, every single thing we tasted was a surprising mix, fresh and unexpected. The ceviche, blood sausage and «pudding chomeur» were by far the best versions of these dishes I've ever tasted. The 39$, 5-course tasting meal is the best deal in the city, hands down. Seriously, go right now before they raise their prices, you won't be disappointed.  They've been getting rave reviews and are now super busy, a reservation is definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great service, ambiance and modern decor. We decided on the 5 course tasting menu and all of the dishes were delicious and creative (except the chicken hearts for me because I don't like eating organs). My favourite was Causa Mezcla: thin yam fries, nori, coriander, avocado on a bed of creamy, mashed yellow potatoes. Every bite was like heaven! Will definitely visit again the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Le repas dépasse nos attentes.... Vraiment délicieux, savoureux et surprenant! Mes coups de cur : ceviche de thon et bouillabaisse... Le décor est également superbe (mur en brique, bois, ardoise), la façade est vitrée et le resto donne sur un parc... Wow ... On y retourne!"}
{"text":"Not particularly good food when I went.  Well, went for lunch and had table d'hote  tried several things between myself and dining buddy  The food was generally poor I would say. Good tomato soup to start- texture was off, but good flavour. Semi stale bun. Always a disappointment.   Fish of the day was 4 rice balls with specs of fish deep fried, in a tomato base with inexplicable bean sprouts thrown in. It was ok. Not something I would recommend or try again but not bad.  Deep fried.   Porc was ok but had the worst ever jarred teriyaki sauce that was hard to swallow  dessert was easily depanneur packaged brownie with buckley's cough syrup. Not edible  Good service nice ambiance  i know lunch is not the same as dinner at a resto but not going to come back."}
{"text":"Simplement délicieux. Tout était parfait le service impeccable félicitation ..."}
{"text":"If you are a foodie, you are going to love this place. The meal I had here was amazing. The presentation and service is excellent in addition to the unique and tasty menu."}
{"text":"While I was in Montreal, the best meal I had was, hands down, at Mezcla in The Village. This Nuevo Latino restaurant hit every mark. Upon entering, the restaurant had a warm and inviting ambiance, long, wooden tables and dim lighting. Not to mention, the service was impeccable the entire time.     Don't expect fancy cocktails at this spot. Instead, take a look at the wine list, with plenty of wonderful Spanish wine options. For my meal, I chose two dishes. First, I went with the Ceviche Mixto, which is altered daily depending on the fresh catches of the day. I was served halibut, octopus and salmon. This dish was incredible. The pieces of fish were generous in size, plump, with perfect texture. It was served in a broth, loaded with flavorful hints of lime and a really nice spicy kick. I also loved the fact that the bowl was completely chilled.  To accompany the dish, there was a presentation of fried yuca chips, crunchy flash fried corn kernels and crispy sweet potato shreds. The idea is to add to the dish to create texture, but I chose to each the fish first and add all the crisp sides into the broth afterward to eat like a soup. I was pretty pleased with my decision.   Next, I had Cazuelita de Pulpo, an octopus dish. This was one of the most unique and delicious variations of octopus I've ever had. Served in a skillet, the octopus was generously glazed in a panca and maple sauce. The texture was tender, and took on almost a thick cut bacon or ham like quality (and taste too, actually). Incorporated in the dish were little dollops of, what I would describe as pesto and cashew puree, which were delicious. This was perfect to dip with the garnish of yuca chips on the top of the dish."}
{"text":"My partner and I had an amazing night at Mezcla on Aug 14.  We enjoyed the 7 course tasting menu, and each individual course was amazing - not a bummer in the bunch.  And at $59 Canadian, these New Yorkers were very pleased.  However, the thing that set the meal above and beyond most others was the servers - each of the four were personable, helpful, cheery, and really made the entire evening spectacular. I can't recommend this restaurant enough!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try Mezcla for sometime now, actually since I'd read Lesley Chesterman's 2013 article in the Gazette on \"Best New Restaurants\" in Montreal. I'd twice tried to get a last minute reservation to no avail, so with a weeks planning I was looking forward to trying this joint, known for Latin American flavored tapas with a twist.  We arrived at the restaurant about fifteen minutes early for our 7 o'clock reservation - I was jetlagged and starving. It was mostly empty with only 2-3 active tables. Then the hostess (who spoke absolutely no english, which shocked both myself and my francophone date - we later made an educated guess that she was dating who appeared to be a manager/owner as she left with him very early), attempted to seat us at a shared table with other guests who were already dining. This is where my first objection took place - An almost empty restaurant and you try to sit us at a shared table? Annoying for us and the already doing couple. She gave us an annoyed look and but still proceeded to seat is at our own table. After this incident, the service excelled, in both official languages, with well-trained and professional wait staff (well, until the very end, but we'll get to that).  Mezcla has a great wine list, very diverse and affordable - we selected a great Portuguese white, a blend of three different grapes and it was midrange at only $46.   The menu is very appealing, particularly in the seafood and fish department, which prior to dinning there, I'd assumed would be their forté. They offer a 5 of 7 course chefs tasting menu for $40-$70 alternately, a great deal, and we'd originally planned to get this. However we were disappointed to read the fine print on the menu and find guests are unable to specify allergies or preferences and as such should order a-la-carte - not really geared towards folks with allergies, perhaps kosher/halal, pescetarians or the ever-growing gluten-intolerant among us!  We choose instead to get three starters and a main to share. Deciding on the octopus, molecular, and shrimp starters and the pork chicharron's main. Even though we specified we'd be sharing everything, the octopus and molecular starters arrived simultaneously, and they had to hold off bringing the shrimp as we were still finishing our second plate. The octopus was good, well cooked and a nice texture added when you got lucky and had a crunchy piece of corn alongside a bite - but there was too much of the heavy sauce in our opinion. Next the molecular seafood starter, which combined again octopus, salmon, tuna and a whitefish in a ceveiche-like marinade - this was delicious, and definitely our favored starting dish; the marinade/sauce was spicy and fresh and those delicious corn kernels again. Finally the shrimp came, it was really a huge prawn circle-wrapped in layers of ribbon-like batter. This was tasty as well, though we both found the brown sauce too sweet, but the alternate green corn source flavorful - our complaint here was with the presentation and serving of this dish on a cutting board. It's an extremely messy dish, and I love messy food, but the cutting board isn't suited for a dish as such, with bits n' pieces flying everywhere (I've included a picture of some of the remains). Instead I think a dish with some kind of edge, to be used as a border against the flying debris, would be better.   The pork chicharron's main ended up being the highlight of the meal - but we're lucky we shared, as this would've been far too much for a single diner. Delicious and melt-in-your-mouth pork covered in a tasty sweet & tangy sauce and topped with crunchy julienned apple slaw.   Finally, the service slipped again when we had to wait about fifteen minutes after requesting our bill. They also don't take Amex, which in my opinion is fine for a low cost restaurant but not really for places located in major cities with allusions to fine dining.   All-in-all, Mezcla is a thoroughly \"OK\" joint."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food and ambience. It was our first meal in Montreal and it did not disappoint. The server was kind, patient and attentive. We had a medley of dishes (all super delicious) including pescado del dia (salmon) with salad and puree, ceviche mezcla, empanadas, and causa de mezcla featuring their catch of the day (halibut). Topped with Spanish white wine, it was easily the best dinner I've had in a long while."}
{"text":"Good food, in a rustic luxe environment.  My hesitation comes because a majority of the 7 courses was fried, including the dessert, donuts.    Favorites of the night were: *fried shrimp, reminded me of a delicate, less greasy version of dim sum *duck and yuca fries, awesome mustard sauce, succulent bird *pork, HUGE portion, super meaty, marbled, texture similar to a short rib, but without the bone  Good: *amuse bouche, little fried balls of white fish and shrimp *octopus tiradito, refreshing, olive sauce overpowered a bit  Misses: *ceviche, salty, never a fan, and I know, usually salty *donut, saturated in sugar, we had one bite and pushed it aside  Uber driver found it difficult to locate, may want to study the location before hopping in your car.  Get a seat by the window if you can.  Ladies with heels, be careful when trekking your way to the bathroom downstairs.    Great representation of Latin cuisine, just needs a bit more variety in preparation methods."}
{"text":"Belle petite place. Clientèle très anglophone. La bouffe est super bonne très inventive et différente. Savoureuse aussi mais pas très abordable... 160$ pour 2 entrées, 2 plats principaux (vraiment grosses portions) et une bouteille de vin. Je recommande de ne pas prendre d'entrée pour calmer l'addition."}
{"text":"Very good spot. Take your time eating the jumbo fried shrimp. Burned my tongue shoving it in my mouth. Pork was well done, enough for two people. Great with white wine. Mostly likely will spend $100+, plus tip. Staff was great, very sexy. They always made sure you were taken care of. Nice quiet spot in the village. Comfortable intimate decor. Definitely an experience worth trying. More Peruvian fusion than traditional."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant twice and both time it's been excellent! This time we ordered the shrimp salad(we shared it and it was huge), fried shrimp as appetizers, and for our entree, we ordered the Chicheron Pork and Cornish Game Hen and both were delicious! We'll definitely be back the next time we're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"At first, I was disappointed by the Spanish Octopus drowned in sauce, and a snooty waiter, but the restaurant soon impressed me with it Chicarron de Cochanilla and its chocolate dessert."}
{"text":"This was hands down one of the best meals we have ever had! We were in Montreal for vacation and went to Mezcla on recommendation of our awesome brew pub tour guide. The staff and servers were top notch-very attentive, friendly and they made awesome recommendations. We ate the veal for two and braised bison short ribs, which were outstanding. The meat was so tender and bursting with flavor. The chef came out to say hi and make sure everything was ok. Overall a fabulous experience- you have to come here when you visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"This restaurant right above the Village was a perfect start to our evening. The open modern interior was airy and comfortable from the moment you enter. The host and servers were very nice. My table mate was fussing over wine like he was a sommelier couldn't decide so the server brought over all of the wine selection for him to try.  The 5 course chef selection was the option decided. I would give us a good mix to try from the kitchen. While I thought it would vary between tables it seems it was all the same as the couple next to us decided upon the same thing so they always looked over at us to see what came next. Each course was beautifully plated and each meal was just enough to satisfy and timed perfectly between. It was a lovely meal and just right as we didn't want a heavy meal to begin our night in the Village. Mezcla was probably one of the favorite meals we had in Montreal so excellent start to the trip!"}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely delivers!   Food : The food is not only amazing in taste, it's also very creative. I highly recommend to try things that you normally don't like because the preparation is very different here (ex.: i absolutely despise blood pudding, but would have it again in a heartbeat at this place).  Service : The staff is very knowledgeable and checks on you regularly. A+  Decor : urban rustic. Very quaint setting. If you are not with a large group, request a small table.  Call to reserve as they are quite busy -with reason"}
{"text":"ditched au pied du cochon and came here because of the review. the service is the best. when i made the reservation, i requested a table at the corner /with a nice view by the window because my sister was visiting and they confirmed so  before the visit. it's really nice of them. and throughout the dinner they were very attentive so that our glasses (of water) were always full.  unfortunately the menu isn't really attractive to us. i would settle for less service and go for the duck in a can and sea urchin pasta next time when i visit montreal.  the amuse which is a piece of duck. i think it's the best for the whole meal. we ordered two appetizers and one main, one dessert. the clam in a pot - too salty and the fries on the side too thin the lime juice scallop/salmon - sauce so overpowering i couldnt tell which one is which main was some beef flank with corn soufflé in a korean style of rock hot pot. i actually like it. it's quite special. the dessert - chocolate soufflé. it's not airy at all. it's a molten cake.  the tasting menu seems to be quite attractive for its price but my sister would like a second dinner at la banquise for some poutine instead....  for as much as i would like to give it more stars because of the friendly and attentive services, the food did not impress my taste bud...."}
{"text":"Quaint, simple, nice little restaurant nestled in Old Montreal. Everything was great. From amuse Bouche to wait staff. The food was amazing with the exception of the Max and cheese lobster. The macaroni was over cooked and hard. The seafood curry was out of this world!! I would highly recommend to try this place. We had a good time!!"}
{"text":"A True Montreal Food Destination! This restaurant is a fantastic blend of Latin American influences and A European-style of cooking. The seafood is quite frankly some of the freshest and most delicious I've tasted during my time in this city. Not only is the food at Mezcla very tasty, but the wine list is very well rounded and offers a good variety. The must-haves: The Ceviche, the Tiraito, the Chaufa de Quinoa, and the chicharrón de cochinillo."}
{"text":"Nominated for people's choice award in Air Canada Enroute magazine, we could not pass on the opportunity to dine here during our recent weekend visit to Montreal. This intent almost came to nought on Sat night when we could not find reservations for dinner. I called up the restaurant and spoke to the reservationist to check if there were any tables or cancelations for the evening. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they could make arrangements for our party. I was then kept on hold for a while only to later be informed that they cannot accommodate us. I was bummed with the service since it was getting pretty late in the night and we almost started driving towards the restaurant. Anyways, upon checking opentable for sunday reservations there was no problem getting a table at our desired time. The restaurant is on a quiet street and was not too busy when we arrived. The service was as expected given that only a few tables were occupied. I was disappointed to learn that they don't have any pisco sours or a cocktail menu but they offered a full service bar and limited wine menu. We mostly stuck to the small plates and ordered a bunch. The amuse bouche was mind blowing (it was a duck heart dipped in huancaina sauce). This only set the bar higher for what was to follow. Unfortunately there were a few misses with the rest of the dinner.   Octopus was too sweet since it was glazed with maple. The first few bites were interesting but the sweetness was overpowering with every subsequent bite  The crispy shrimp was creative but overrated. The sauce again erred on the side of sweetness but you cannot eat w/o it since it's dry. I quite enjoyed the thinly shaved phyllo crust on the shrimp though - very light although it was deep fried  Tiradito of Red deer with foie gras did not pack the flavor punch we were expecting. It was a good dish but not a great one.  The lucuma dessert was probably one of the biggest disappointments. For those who've never had lucuma will most likely like it but for those who've tried it before you will definitely notice the difference. The ice cream itself was not sweet but the dulce de leche added the sweet component to the dish. I liked the fact that they added some cocoa nibs to balance the overall sweetness in the dessert.  Our favorite was the asian style crispy duck arepitas with foie gras torchon. It was juicy and the fresh chinese buns were the perfect fluffy pillow to absorb the jus. We craved for more and ended up ordering it again.  There was definitely creativity on display but none of the dishes except the crispy duck would make me order it again."}
{"text":"As a first note, the food here deserves five stars. I'd give such a review save for one thing. Our table was seated near the half-open kitchen and I overheard one of the cooks/chefs saying something incredibly inappropriate to a server while bitching her out. So if you're sitting near the kitchen, beware of whoever this foul-mouthed dude is. That said, everything at the table (from the sticky bun entrees to the magret with the bison ribs in between) was absolutely glorious. The wine list is affordable and the service is generally wonderful, save for some water filling-related hovering. That said, the open kitchen is slightly annoying, writ-large, as the chef has to leave the kitchen to finish some of the dishes, and they don't really have their expediting system down. Endame, you must try the pouding chomeur!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 9:30 PM and had the tasting menu, consisting of 6 courses chosen by the chef.   We started with an octopus fritter, followed by a duck heart skewered with yuca fries (that was my favorite), salmon ceviche, and black pudding empanadas with a side of coconut curry sauce.  Next was the Chicharron de Cochinillo - piglet with a mango salad (this is a very big piece of meat). Very crispy on the outside which was very enjoyable to eat but it was overly dry in the inside. The sauce coming with it made it better but it was a little bit too salty for my taste. The mango salad had a touch of spiciness, which was very well balanced with the dish in general.   Following the pork was the maple pudding chômeur with vanilla ice cream. It was way too sweet for me, I couldn't finish it.   Pisco sour, best cocktail ever, I wanted to get more than one but since I had few drinks at another place before dinner, I stopped myself from having more. I will definitely come back just for that drink.   On the ambiance side, I found the place a bit too dark, it was hard to see our dishes. The services was good in general except at the beginning where one of the waiters seemed to not have much patience when we asked him to explain what was one of the dish. I understand it was getting late but as long as you're still in your shift and serving clients, you must stay professional until the end."}
{"text":"I went here for my graduation dinner and we had the tasting menu of 6 courses. The causa is to die for, and I'm pretty picky for Peruvian food and causa specially, since it's my favourite dish. Only one that can compete with my mom's causa."}
{"text":"First off, don't get me wrong: this was an excellent, well-executed meal in a lovely, somewhat rustic environment. Each dish had an incredible amount of thought put it into every single detail and was well worth the $39 tasting menu. When I alerted them of my allergy to arthropods, they were more than willing to accommodate me on one of the dishes.   Unfortunately, my experience was soured by the service. When I made a reservation, I was told on the phone that their banking system was down when I went, meaning they were accepting cash only. I'll admit it: I should've remembered, but a reminder before we were seated (and more importantly, before we were slammed with a $150 check) would have been nice to avoid the awkward post-meal run to the ATM. What if we hadn't reserved, or had reserved online instead? What then?  Furthermore, the gap behind dishes was quite substantial, sometimes lasting up to an hour. Hey, I enjoy long and slow meals as much as the next person, but an hour? Really? I'd assume that if there is a set menu that's decided upon in advance, the kitchen should've made the appropriate preparations to streamline the process such that some tables aren't waiting for an hour for the next dish. The servers did very little to address or apologize for this, instead choosing to chat amicably amongst themselves or with larger, more mature parties.  Overall, an exceptional gastronomical experience provided by a clearly knowledgeable culinary team that was unfortunately marred by the execution. Likely won't be back."}
{"text":"God. Where do I start? We went during a specific event; we had 9 courses meal for 39$. The restaurant invited a chef for Greece so the menu was inspired from him. It was simply delicious. Fresh, creative, tasty, we'll plated, simple and yet super interesting plates. 9 plates on 9 we're off the hook. I can't even point out something negative. It was my fourth time in this restaurant. Every time I go I'm pleased. The service is efficient, professional, friendly (just enough) the wine card affordable and yet interesting, the decor is neat and nice, plus they have an open kitchen and really, for the price you pay it is SO worth it. I was there  with a friend but I'd go there on a date anytime, or with a group of friend. I just love this place. It never disappoint. It's the type of place that allows you to be yourself, don't need to have attitude to be cool there. Its about food and dining experience. It's much appreciated. You should go."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe and had wonderful (as long as you don't mind familiar) service. The amuse and apps were definitely the highlight of this meal, far outshining the main courses.  The amuse was a perfectly cooked bite of duck, really a great start. For apps, we shared the venison with foie (really good), the smoked duck (fantastic, non-kitschy smoke-releasing presentation and a flavor heavy on anise, which I as a licorice hater somehow found room to adore), and a raw fish and yucca plate (not totally memorable, but definitely fresh and not disappointing). I think we were all hoping for killer next courses, but I think we all were a little nonplussed. Two of us went for the seafood mix, which had its highs and lows (not too rich broth strangely labeled as a bisque with some great bits of fish and some lackluster mussels), and another for the pork (definitely not the best iteration any of us had tried). Still, I think the tone of the meal and the good start made this an overall positive and I'd go back to find some better dishes to try.   It is a relatively pricey meal, and the wine list reflects that."}
