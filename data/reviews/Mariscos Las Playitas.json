{"text":"Best shrimp cocktail in the state. Service was excellent. We are excited to go back. Give it a try and cut the location some slack."}
{"text":"Excellent place to get a little flavor of Mexico. Staff is friendly and helpful. The food is awesome and do yourself a favor and have a Michelada."}
{"text":"delicious!! very friendly!  wont let you check in here or my woman would be the duchess !! haha"}
{"text":"Great food , service was good. I drove by this place a couple times didn't care to stop didn't look presentable. One day decided to go in , and it Surprized me ceviche awesome micheladas awesome. Been here a couple times know and it's good."}
{"text":"We came for a soccer tournament and after winning both games mariscos sounded perfect. Definitely would stop by again. The tostadas de cevichr are excellent, very tasty fresh. Plus the coctel de camaron con pulpo hit the spot."}
{"text":"Mariscos Las Playitas' biggest \"problem\" (if that's the right word for it) is its location.  It definitely isn't in a good part of town, as has been mentioned in other reviews.  And while it might sound racist to say so, people were VERY surprised when two white guys walked into the place (or maybe, they looked at how fat I was and were scared there'd be no food left over after I had dinner ... who knows?).  And also, as mentioned in other reviews, the music can be very loud and the decor is definitely basic.

Now, if you can get beyond the fact that this isn't a place out to impress you or attract middle-class gringos, who aren't happy unless everything is perfect, you'll do perfectly fine here.  Yes, the location and decor are nothing to write home to mom about; but the food is quite good and the service very friendly.  

I had the filet a la diablo and I asked for it to be muy picante.  The sauce had the tanginess of a BBQ sauce, but wasn't sweet (and it WAS very spicy).  I asked for a larger portion of salad instead of rice and beans and while plain, the lime served with the meal made an acceptable dressing.  The fish was quite tasty.  My partner had the filet a la Ajo, which is a garlic fish.  When it came, I was very concerned, because it looked like it was buried in garlic ... and I'm not exaggerating.  And while I could smell the garlic, both of us confirmed upon taste, that it wasn't overly garlic-tasting at all.  Also, in contrast to other places, which use a lot of oil, there wasn't much on this fish.  The garlic was far from overpowering and the rice and beans, while very basic, tasted good, too  (so he told me).  The ceviche, by the way, was also good.

For the two of us, the bill came to $27 total before tip and included an iced tea on it.  Hardly unreasonable and the size of the portions were more than adequate.  If you've read my other reviews, you know I'm constantly whining about portions not being big enough; so if I say they're adequate here, you can be sure they are unless you're an impossible glutton.

I'm not sure how comfortable I'd feel being in this area at night; but aside from that, no one made me feel uncomfortable or unwelcome after the first looks of surprise from the patrons.  Perhaps there'd be a lot less surprised looks, if more people turned their mental assumptions off and had an open enough mind to try something different, somewhere different and paid this place a visit.  In this case, the effort would be worth it."}
{"text":"Came during dinner, you seat yourselves, staff is friendly and with alot of people the room does echos and hard to hear the other person across from you. 

I can't get away from the ceviche it is very good comes with four tostadas."}
{"text":"Initial Impression:
Hard to find, its right off of the side of a major street in a subdivision. Hard to notice its a restaurant.

Pros:
Food tasted really good
Horchata is freshly made
Clean
Nice venue 
Wide variety of food
Friendly Employees

Cons:
Walked in & there were about 20 men in there more like a bar feel. 
Hostess was not at the front
Waited a while
Parking lot is dirt

Experience:
We finally foundthe restaurant & parked on the side next to it. Dirt gravel parking space. Not good for heels or flats. We walked in & waited a while before the hostess appeared. She was very nice. Service was fast & great. We were brought chips & salsa. We were running behind on time so we got our food to go & they jumped on it. Fast easy check out.

Overall: 
Worth a second visit, food is worth it"}
{"text":"¡Su cóctel de camarones es lo mejor! Gran servicio y salsa, también. El propietario es muy agradable. Es un poco caro porque es marisco, pero vale la pena."}
{"text":"Omg this place is wonderful have great food and they have great customer service. They greet u nicely and attend u very well recommend to anyone who loves seafood."}
{"text":"The number 21...the most delicious shredded beef hard shell (hand made) tacos with real mozzarella of my entire life. The rice and beans are perfect. Best hole in the wall choice for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"They are a diamond in the rough. The atmosphere isn't great and they play their music too loud,  but they have good food."}
{"text":"Bomb ceviche and micheladas! The hostess was alone but she got around quickly and was very polite! Will def stop by here again if ever in Arizona. They have a great music choice and everything was super clean! Loooooove it!"}
{"text":"With the four stars we hoped for an unforgettable authentic Mexican meal. Restaurant easy to find kinda in a run down area, oh well sometimes that's where the best food is. Our first clue should if been the house that's part of the parking area that the lights had been absolutely or electricity been turned off, the tenants were out sitting on couches and steps. The second clue should of been the music that we could hear from our parked car. On entering the establishment we saw one table occupied  the rest empty, the group of five musicians were playing so load that I never new what the waitress was saying or my group. The room was small , we ordered drinks and learned there was no hard liquor Fortunately one us had two pair of ear plugs that they inserted immediately . I chose to insert to big wars of napkins in my ears. We discussed leaving but we didn't want to be hasty. We ordered and prayed they would stop playing. Both of the orders of chimichangas were over fried and the tortilla was so thick We could not cut it . Both of the guys had enchiladas the sauce was something other than the normal one , one of the plates had to be sent back cuz it was cold. The prices were the same as a fine franchise , Chilies , El Toro, . We waited longer than necessary for our food considering we were the only table ordering. Yes the music finally stopped near the end of our meal.
Don't go , it's a waste of your money and time we were very very disappointed. This was November 25   ."}
{"text":"My dad use to visit a number of places to eat, but for more then 10 years he continued to visit Mariscos Las Playitas. He was known to order his own creation of a burrito as he was picky at what he did or didn't want to eat. Now, you can visit and ask for a Marco burrito, the chefs & most of the host's know exactly what to ring up. The burrito comes with carne asada, eggs or bacon, potato's, cheese and cilantro."}
{"text":"It might not be located in one of the best places in town, but it is worth it. Something that I really struggle with in Arizona is finding a seafood restaurant where the food is as good as the service. I must say that I have found it! Finally!!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot, kinda hood but i like the feel of home. Good service, seafood was fresh, tosatadas de camaron were great and delicious. Micheladas kinda watered down but overall good and refreshing for this heat. Owner was really cool guy, randomly comes to your table to check up on you and tell jokes.. Try it. Youll like it"}
{"text":"Came here and the food is BOMB!! They had a 3 band man and they sound like a big banda! The owner Guillermo came and talked to us and was really nice.  I'm definitely coming back and will refer my peeps to eat here!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and affordable. The area looks stretchy like if people are drug dealing around lol that's just my perception don't let that discourage you.  I'm not from AZ but it was a good place to stop and eat on the way."}
{"text":"Moved to the neighborhood ad wanted some Mexican food, stopped in here and was greeted by a nice waitress. We(family of 5) ordered simple 6 tacos for the kids, Chimichanga for myself and my wife ordered a taco plate. My chimi was EXTRA juicy which made it terrible, the beans where runny and the rice was under cooked. After this experience we figured we would just pay and go......well..wasn't expecting a 65 dollar check after only ordering what we did...not worth the 65 dollars AT ALL. Lesson learned!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever!  Full of flavor and very authentic. Absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Been coming here for years. I believe they have the best shrimp cocktail in the WEST SIDE. COME TRY IT OUT."}
{"text":"came here with my family the service was just okay  ,, the food took way too long to arrive there was about 2 other tables with just men drinking total downer!! the food was decent not the best I've had a day later my husband and I had food poisoning we had the same thing we shared a botana mixta will not be coming here again!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 3 years love the food and the girls are always really nice and the owner as well"}
{"text":"Great shrimp and octopus cocktail, probably one of the best I've ever had. It's a little pricier than most other places for the location, but the food, or at least the cocktails, is worth it. Can't wait to try other dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"Felt totally out of place..but the servers are good and friendly. Seems like a local hangout to have a beer after work.. #tokenasian 

Food is fresh, huge portions for ceviche, the Caldo 7 mares tasted fresh. My son's breaded fish fillet has just the right amount of breading and was good. He enjoyed it

I love that they have about 6 choices for hot sauces readily  available at the table.

however, please expect it to be loud in there with a live band playing  in a small place that comfortably fits about 15 rectangular tables. lol my boys felt their eardrums got blasted off."}
{"text":"Saw this placed opened and my family and I wanted to try it out we figure seafood is expensive but having to pay $217 for 8 ppl was a bit scary. The waitress didn't even ask for drinks until I asked her if she could take our order, the food takes awhile to come out and I asked for a shrimp taco and gave me fish I told the lady and she was snotty about it and brought me a shrimp taco and the tortilla was cold and soggy , the shrimp dishes only come with 6 shrimps a little bit of rice and lettuce for $16 .. Never going again"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some ceviche and shrimp soup. Def good portions and flavors. I am definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Came here about 2 weeks ago the aguachiles didn't taste anything like aguachiles it was basically avocado and lime over the shrimp, no flavor whatsoever."}
