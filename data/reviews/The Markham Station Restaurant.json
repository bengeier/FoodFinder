{"text":"One of the only true \"diners\" left in the east end. Great food, good family pricing and the staff is always friendly. Hard to find that combination nowadays. Prices are very reasonable, and the size and quality of the food is great . Very family friendly and you can't beat the early bird breakfast special."}
{"text":"Horrible that the restaurant serves turkey bacon which is a substitute for people who choose not to eat pork for a hefty price of 5.99 extra. They both cost the same at the grocery store so why the deterrent for people who enjoy bacon. Never was like this before the reno. Very disappointed my only option was to not get meat at the same price. My advice choose somewhere that is more in tune with the world"}
{"text":"Terrible service!

I would give this place a negative if Yelp would let me!

We waited more than 30 mins for our food and they serves us with the wrong order.  We asked about our order since it was wrong  and the waiter said \"it's okay, the chef does what he wants.\" 
In addition, we were in the middle of eating our food and our waiter rushed to clean up our table. 

He was extremely rude and didn't even let us enjoy the wrong order of food. 

Never coming to this place ever again!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Horrible service. Two thumbs down. Will never go here again.

The food was greasy, bland, and disgusting. How do they screw up eggs and toast? The waitress was extremely rude. She told us to hurry up and leave because her shift was ending. When I brought my complaint to the manager, he didn't care and was outright rude. If that's how they think they'll keep customers then keep it up.

I will never go to this place again and I tell everyone I know to stay away. I hope they go out of business so that others won't have to be subjected to their garbage food and garbage attitude. They don't even deserve one star but there's no option for zero."}
{"text":"Lovely server, awful food. Came Thursday afternoon, so place wasn't busy. Ordered eggs with home fries, toast, and sausage. Came out incredibly quickly but the food was cold. Got the server to take it back but again it came out quickly and clearly the food had just been reheated - I could see where I had eaten from and the pepper I had added. Maybe we needed to specify we wanted fresh food?? Lost my appetite. Never returning."}
{"text":"When you have a table next to the bussing station, please be considerate and do not slam the dishes when you're putting them away. All the clanging made it hard for me to hear and eventually gave me a headache. In addition, there was a questionable spill on the floor of my booth as well as my seat. 

The food was alright. Typical breakfast for a decent price."}
{"text":"OK not fine dining, on my first visit ...food was tasty & service was quick.  The waitress on in the afternoon was very considerate & helped us  to pick from the huge menu and in accommodating food allergies."}
{"text":"Worst rude service ....Disgusting foods....salty left over heated burned creamy chicken soup .... Nasty undercook sausages....gross!!!"}
{"text":"Worst place for breakfest nothing special and really really expensive. 
Everything is generic and the own is this greek or italian guy with a pony tail whos really really rude and doesnt care about his customers. 
I had the burger once, it was one of those frozen burgers u can find at any store for 25cents a peice. It had a dry bun and old veggies that have been sitting around for a while. 
This place is loaded with gangster wanna bees and thugs STAY AWAY!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Someone recommended this all day breakfast restaurant so I've decided to go and check it out. The service was awful. The waitress treated me as if I wasn't there. I've ordered a soup and breakfast but my soup never showed up and they served with wrong food. At the end, one of the complementary candies was missing. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just crave greasy diner food, coupled with rude service in the dead of the night, surrounded by questionable clientele. Markham Station has it all. Too expensive for what it is though.

PS - they charge $1.50 for hot water. Sketchy move"}
{"text":"Food was not especially good and service was really not that great. Went here on a Saturday morning for brunch and service was slow even though it wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"I love breakfast and I do value good breakfast for a reasonable price. I like how big this place is and lots of room to sit down. But I didn't like the long wait time and also how late the staff were to serve me. The food quality was better than average but I have still had better ones. Overall an ok place to eat. Worth trying it"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Arrived as a group - called days ahead - and they would not accommodate individual billing and were not staffed for a large group.  For a place that advertises fast service it took nearly 90 minutes for our group to get served.  Too 45min for drinks alone.   Multiple people cancelled orders and left because we had younger children in our group who after 90 minutes of waiting the time of day had become too late for them.  I had ordered the western sandwich and a milkshake.  The food was sub par, bland, and mostly uninteresting.   One of my fellow diners had a fly in their salad and another took 2 hours to get a glass of coke.

Service was rude and indignant from the one server who handled a group of 40.  She consistently complained about too many people and not having her coffee yet.  I'm not sure how this is the diner's problem.  Even after getting our food it took 30 or more minutes to get bills.  Even after all this she automatically added 10% tip to the bills.

TL;DR = Don't go here. Bad food, bad service. Legitimately the worst restaurant experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"They are open 24 hours in Scarborough. What more do you want? lol You can't come here with super high expectations. 

Their all day breakfast is great however it is pretty greasy compared to other breakfast joints. They also serve different foods like souvlaki dinners, salads, sandwiches, ribs, roasted chicken and etc.  I've only ever had their breakfast foods and chicken souvlaki dinner. Their portions are pretty big, you will not leave feeling hungry if you actually eat your food. 

Service here is pretty quick and they always have CP24 on. So catch up on your daily news and weather while munching away at some food that quick!"}
{"text":"Was there with a few friends last night.  Even though we arrived past midnight on a weekday, it was surprising to see quite a few customers dining there.

Upon being seated, the first thing I did was order a hot chocolate to warm me up, as it was -20 degrees outside.  Waited for 25 minutes, before I had to remind the waitress again....no biggie.

Food was pretty standard diner fare.  Ordered the club sandwich, which came with a cup of mayo on the side (nice touch).  Reasonably tasty, but not the best I've had by any stretch.  

I did notice they serve pretty big portions for pretty much any dish....my friends seemed quite content with whatever they ordered.

Overall good experience, and would recommend to anyone looking for some late-night grub.  Don't expect to be blown away by the food...,but you will get your stomach filled."}
{"text":"Expensive ! Just don't buy any overly priced drinks. Below average service. Unless they change, no second time."}
{"text":"Facts:

1. I only EVER order the \"Super Breakfast\".
2. I never regret the food coma that follows it.

Pros:

1. Open 24/7.
2. The \"Super Breakfast\": 3 eggs (any style), 3 strips of bacon, 3 sausages, 3 pancakes, and home fries OR roast potatoes OR rice.
3. The \"Super Breakfast\" is amazing EVERY DAMN TIME; steaming hot, not too greasy, eggs are literally cooked the way you want them. 
4. If you're lucky and the young white guy waiter is working, he'll ask you if you want pancakes OR French toast (for the \"Super Breakfast\")
5. And he won't charge you extra for this forbidden substitution.
6. French toast.

Cons:

1. Middle-aged white lady waitress who talks with a phony American accent.
2. My boyfriend and I each ordered a \"Super Breakfast\" once with A basket of cheese fries to share, and phony-accent waitress wouldn't write it down. She kept saying \"Are you sure? That's a LOT of food\", in the most patronizing tone. Absolutely ridiculous. Don't fucking judge what I decide to eat - that's not your fucking job.
3. Middle-aged fat white lady waitress who spent more time talking shit about her coworkers and yelling at the chef than taking our orders. She literally would not even walk up the stairs to our table, but stood at the bottom and took our order.

Conclusion:

1. Three stars because shitty waitresses are the worst.
2. Get the \"Super Breakfast\"."}
{"text":"Markham station is a classic breakfast place.  It's kid friendly with activities and crayons.  The breakfast is good, however my complaint is that they need more variety with their pancakes - for example, chocolate chip pancakes, or blueberry pancakes.

Friendly service staff."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for brunch for the first time. From the outside, it seems a good choice
 However, when I got the order, it tuns out a wrong wrong wrong choice! The food tasted terrible! Eggs tasted like plastic, no mention about the fronze bacon and werid home made potota. I stop eating and left 99% of the food on my plate. What wrose was the bad customer service, or no customer service. I end up left the restaurant and no tip. Yes, the terrible food + bad customer service, do not worth a penny of any tip. Never never go there."}
{"text":"This place is much nicer after the upgrades. The staff have always been friendly and the food is pretty decent. It's open 24 hours which is great when you get the late night menchies.

Oh yeah their fries tastes like McDonald's but no complaints here."}
{"text":"The only reason I checked this place out was because it;s open 24/7 and nothing else was open, it has generally poor reviews and I can honestly say that's a pretty accurate sum up. I ordered from the all day breakfast menu, (50z Chicken breast with 3 eggs, hash brown,choice of sides) Which was $11.

The chicken was surprisingly decent, not too dry. The eggs were good (how can you mess eggs up), hash brown were terrible, It was stale and not crispy, and not very hot either. Most likely frozen. Toast was decent.

For $11 I think you're getting ripped off, If you calculate the food cost it was probably $2 max. They try to fill the plate with lots of hash browns and toast. Generally the menu was expensive for seemingly how little you get.

If It's late and that's the only place possible for you, then go, if not, there are many other great 24/7 places."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Markham Station and I don't think it'll be my last.

My group of 8 and I came here at around 2am and seating was no problem at all. There are lots of large areas where all 8 of us could sit comfortably and on the same table. 

Being 24h definitely makes this spot a great option for late night owl and sometimes just because there's nothing else open. We had a very friendly waitress that was fairly attentive, no complaints on the service. The location was apparently renovated and it seemed like they did a good job. Decor was very nice and modern.

We made the mistake of grabbing McDonalds before hand because we weren't sure if we were coming here or not, and boy was that a mistake. Almost all of us ordered \"The Super\" which is available all day and comes with 3 pancakes, 3 sausages, 3 strips of bacon and 3 eggs along with home fries. 

The bacon was extremely crispy, sausages were nice and juicy, pancakes and eggs  were not bad, and the home fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Really no complaints about this meal and none of us were able to finish. The best part is that the entire meal is only 12.99! 

As this being my first time here, I'm going to make sure I come on an empty stomach the next time! 4/5"}
{"text":"If only there was a way to rate this restaurant as zero stars. My friend and I were ignored at the door by a server writing 'no separate bills, no debit' on a blackboard. We were seated only to be ignored by our server who was rude. We went in there hungry and ready to eat and after seeing that I couldn't order what I wanted (a grilled chicken salad) we finally called it quits and walked out. This was the third strike Markham Station. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Extremely bad food.    The black lady waitress gave us an attitude when I pointed out her bad service this very early morning.   I talked to her why we were not happy with her service politely and calmly, but she talked me back without apology.  She also raised her voice toward us.  As an excuse, she said to us her shift was over long time ago, but she had to be there for her co-worker.    So what?     I did not give her tips after all this conversation.   She behaved worse after."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the music and memories I've had here. This used to be the only breakfast restaurant I knew of that was open 24 hours until I came along a more affordable, better-tasting one called Honey B Hive. 

Only come to Markham Station if you have a lot of time to waste. The food takes forever and the staff are not attentive at all. Even getting a table takes long when it is not busy. The food is a bit overpriced but it is not bad. 

The only thing that ticked me off the last time I came here was this one waitress who had no adequate manners whatsoever and just reached for my baby, touching her face and who knows where else before we could even say anything. Mind you, she has quite intense allergies that the waitress could have easily had contact to. When we said something the second time she did it, she didn't apologize and just stomped off. By the way, we asked to switch waiters but they told us it's by section so we just let it go and ate quickly so we could leave. 

It is extremely rude to touch someone without their permission especially if that person doesn't have a voice of their own yet and obviously would not like strangers touching them in any way just as we would not enjoy strangers touching us. Markham Station is unprofessional in general (their other waiters aren't much better - they are usually talking loudly amongst themselves instead of noticing customers calling for their attention), but after this experience, I don't think I will ever come back."}
{"text":"Ok so, second time I've ever been here and I'm not sure I'll be back. Food was fine but I asked for a spinach and mozzarella cheese omelette but asked for cheddar instead of mozzarella they charged me for a cheese omelette with an add on of spinach. Seems really petty to me to charge me for something different than I asked to get an extra $1.50 on the bill. Is that wrong of me to assume you can just swap out cheeses or am I being petty?

3 stars just because the food was good."}
{"text":"I adore Markham Station. Cheap great greasy food, open 24 hours. The ladies here are almost always sweet as honey, too. Just avoid the take out place next door, just come and sit and enjoy some cheap yummy eggs and bacon at 4 am. Or 9 pm. Whatever."}
{"text":"Sitting down with food in front of me in under 10 mins!!!

And that's where it ends...I needed a quick breakfast and was in the area so I stopped in.  It's nothing special; I can make this at home.  It was quick & cheap & not McDonalds."}
{"text":"After a long night of partying, our group was tired and famished. Desperate for food, we luckily spotted Markham Station. All we wanted was something cheap and filling; this establishment filled that void in our stomachs. Markham Station had a very expansive menu including an all day breakfast menu. The food was plentiful but cheap, in which was reflected in quality. I ordered the well-done steak which was great, the eggs okay, but the fries were horrible. The interior likewise reflected the pricing of the menu; bland, few colours, but lots of windows. Service was slow and not very friendly. The crowd too seemed a bit sketchy but that maybe because we went at 2am. All and all, this place is like a downgraded Golden Grill. Open 24 hours, cheap but expansive menu with deplorable service and atmosphere. Dine here only if you are desperate for a filling meal at 2am!"}
{"text":"This place is cheap and dirty. 

My work comes here for breakfast 3 times a year and the place always leaves me feeling sick to my stomach. I don't think it's food poisoning but a normal person cannot handle that much grease. After learning my lesson a couple times with their traditional breakfast or omlette, I have switched my order to a bagel and fruit bowl which is only mildly better. I usually find a few pieces of over ripe fruit in the mix.

This place is somewhere I'd never choose to go on my own, but if all you're looking for is the absolute cheapest option, you may have found your place because the portions in the breakfasts are a decent size.

Anyway, my recommendation would be to skip this place unless you love your grease served with a little egg and bacon. YUCK!"}
{"text":"Went there this morning with my parents and kids for breakfast, and i have to say, off the hop, i was totally floored by the belligerent waiter we had.  Aggressive and rude, he cut me off when i ordered my food.  i only wanted two eggs, but he said, \"I'm not serving you the two eggs.  you can have the 3 egg plate for the same price as the two eggs.  I didn't want 3 eggs, and i certainly didn't care if it was the same price.  It is a waste and i could't finish the 3 eggs anyway.
At that point we should have left, because the food was terrible to boot.  the eggs were oily as was the peameal bacon.  My son ordered chicken fingers and they were terrible.  He didn't touch them.
As we were getting ready to leave, the waiter was at the table behind us. They were a group of late teen aged men.  i heard him say to the one ordering, \"um...i can see your lips moving but i can't hear a word coming out of your mouth.\"  What a complete ass.   He had a constant look of disdain on his face, as if he would rather be anywhere else than there.  
I did tell the hostess on the way out that he was very rude and he shouldn't be working with people. 
if you do go here, and you get this server, ask to change tables immediately.  As soon as he opens his mouth to talk, you'll know exactly who I'm talking about."}
{"text":"This place is amazing after its renovations! Service is nice and friendly and the food seemed to have improved a lot after it being renovated it's no more greasy but they have options between roasted potatoes, rice, and regular fries with every breakfast special. I've been coming here regularly after it's renovations! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I've been to Markham Station a handful of times and I never had high expectations but my last experience was absolutely horrible.

We went during very late hours and there were very few customers. The staff were too lazy to greet us at the door and we sat at one of the tables they pointed us to. It took way too long for the server to come by to take our orders (approximately 15 minutes, even though she only served a few tables). We ordered a Steak Sandwich and Cannelloni. As mentioned before, I did not have high expectations but our food was very sub-par. The steak had a very pale brown colour to it and it did not looked like it was grilled. The cannelloni was very cheesy but also lacked taste.

The worse part of our experience had to be the service. Our drinks came much after our food arrived and our server was not only rude to us but also to other customers. As mentioned before, they did not seat customers but rather point to tables. One couple came in and did not want to sit where the server pointed so they moved to another table without talking to the server. Under the server's breath, I could hear her say \"ok sit where ever the hell you want\". The couple probably should have asked the server but that type of language is unacceptable to paying customers.

After our terrible experience, I left no tip and I can hear the server saying we were cheap. Very unprofessional. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I like that this place is open 24/7. It's so convenient when you're out late at night (like 3am) and there's nothing else open. Markham Station offers decently sized portions of food, no complaints there. Pricing of the menu can be kinda on the expensive side, I mean, considering the value of the food's quality and taste falls short of impressive. It's just really average to me. They do have early bird specials though, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Hence the fact they gave us the bill with out us finishing or eating, we couldn't even order dessert the bills were already made from 11:11pm we left at 1:45am we came in at 11:00pm. My lady forgot my pancake, the lady then brought wrong food to our table... I'm highly disappointed in the way they took my cup and refill. Some cups were duty. And the photo will state the rest"}
{"text":"About the only thing it has going for it is that it's open 24-hours which is a rarity in that part of the city. The menu is extensive, but I get the impression that the reason they're able to do this is that a lot of things are frozen. The breakfast food is better than the rest of the menu I find. If you're hungry, it's late, you don't feel like asian food or driving to a better option downtown (like 7 West or Fran's) then it'll do."}
{"text":"The Markham Station is the best place to go for breakfast or pretty much anything. The people who work there are so amazingly friendly and kind"}
{"text":"How does this restaurant stay in business?  The service is absolutely horrible, and the food is mediocre. The waiter makes you feel like you owe him a favour. When you complain to the manager, he tries to pretend like everything is okay by saying \"it's okay, he just needs a break right? Right? Right?\" while tapping you on the shoulder like he's your friend.
UPDATE:
So I think the waiter realized he was being a prick and tried to make up for his attitude. I'll bump the rating from 1 to 2 stars because he actually made an attempt to redeem himself."}
{"text":"I came here to appease my family when they suggested this place a day for breakfast.  After my last experiences i was determined to avoid this place.

Edible enough food with spotty service on weekends. Basically Your staple breakfast foods (eggs, homefries, sausage, toast and coffee). 

My one major peeve is the lack of quicker service on my past 2 visits this year. Moreover the quality of service. The coffee comes with free refills, when I was a kid I recall the servers coming by frequently. I had to flag the servers down multiple times for this. The servers are polite, but I guess it's difficult to manage on busier days?


I come here, think of my childhood, come
With my parents. I guess it's tradition, but I remember it being way way better. But I think it's time I convince my brother to love
Eggsmart more than this place."}
{"text":"Been here once twice before and did not enjoy it but because we were starving and it was the only thing open, we decided to stop by. Once again, service and food was definitely disappointing. 

Their breakfast was sub-par; nothing special. Their regular food (we got pork souvlaki), was DEFINITELY OVERPRICED. We got 4 tiny pieces of dry, tasteless pork, with \"roasted potatoes\" that were drenched in oil for 15.99 plus tax. Ridiculous. 

Our server was quite rude and obnoxious, it took us half an hour to even get the bill and cashed out. Two of the other servers had to get the machine going for us because Lord knew where our server was. I was even asked to set up the machine myself. Lol.. 

Will definitely be our last visit there. Would rather starve at home."}
{"text":"Standard greasy diner fare but heck I only came here for the Station Cheesy fries and it was good. You get a huge platter of it and its loaded up with cheese and bacon. Can't ask for anything more, just wanted a simple indulgence. Servers are really nice and it's a huge place, shouldn't have problems getting a table no matter what time you show up here."}
{"text":"The food not bad but horrible service. Waiter almost forced  a goodbye from us when we were disappointed by her service."}
{"text":"I came here on a holiday around 11ish and this place was packed. Sometimes you'd think a restaurant is really great because it is packed.  But it wasn't really the case here. I think the reason why this place was packed is because of the price. I must say, the price was very affordable for brunch items. They even have $6.99 breakfast special. The space was comfortable and spacious. And the waiting didn't take long. Less than 15 minute wait time even though there were 5-6 groups ahead of us. 

I ordered the egg benny florentine and it was only alright. Some of my complaints for me were the hollandaise sauce and home fries. The hollandaise sauce was bland. I've never tried such bland hollandaise sauce. How on earth could you fail hollandaise sauce? Hollandaise sauce is what makes an eggs benny. And to me that was a big fail. The home fries were bad. Even with ketchup, it didn't help with the taste at all. Their pancakes were also very dense and dry. Our server didn't seem like she enjoyed working here and it was hard for us to locate her to address some missing items such as milk for our coffee.

If you don't care much for quality and just want a cheap, quick breakfast then this is a place for you."}
{"text":"I came to The Markham Station Restaurant on a Saturday night at 6:30 p.m., and it was fairly empty. My friend had recommended the restaurant to me based on its prices, so I figured I might as well give it a try. Unfortunately, both the food and service were below my expectations. 

MAIN COURSE: I ordered the Clubhouse Wrap (without bacon) with a side house salad (Italian dressing). The coleslaw had a greater pickle taste to it than the coleslaw I am used to eating - but I loved it! (Primarily because I love pickles). The salad was okay - nothing great about it, but nothing bad about it either. However, the wrap itself was extremely cold; the tomatoes had a texture as though they were frozen and were in the process of defrosting. Similarly, the turkey was very cold and lacked seasoning - I found myself dipping the wrap in the Italian dressing sauce and mustard for some flavour. 

SERVICE: We were seated fairly quickly upon arrival at the restaurant, but it took some time for someone to take our orders and request our drink preferences. Our waitress was kind, but we were not able to find her in order to receive change for the bill; eventually, another waitress came to take our cash, after which our waitress returned with the change."}
{"text":"One of my fav's, this place is open 24hrs w/ breakfast! Service is awesome and quick! Food rocks! It's really cool!"}
{"text":"A real 24 hours restaurant and bar in Scarborough.
Large very spacious, all day breakfast and a large menu with varieties.

Been there many times (those late bites).

A+ Great staff, very friendly and quick service.

Food it's not the greatest but can't complain it's cheap and portions are huge."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning for some breakfast... 2nd time around and i have to say i should have paid the extra money and went to coras. 

I got the western omelette and it was dry, their hash brown was dry. Its a sad meal when ketchup cant even save the meal. 20cents for jam... I couldn't even enjoy jam on my white toast that i didn't get asked whether i wanted white or brown. 

Oh yes and i felt bad for my friend as i started to realize that the server instead of asking for help stacked my plate on top of hers. So i got some steak sauce on the side of my plate. 

Not a place ill be coming back again."}
{"text":"The food is great and affordable but the servers are so rude. I would enjoy eating at this place more If i got better service."}
{"text":"This is the Scarborough-equivalent establishment to Smoke's Poutinerie/Burrito Boyz when you want something late-night.  

It has been around for a long time and the food here is cheap.  If you come late at night, you will get the occasional ruckus from the drunks but overall not a bad place to grab a bite when you should be sleeping.

The standard breakfast joint fare: steak and eggs, omelets, fries, salads, french toast.  

Don't expect stellar service, you're at their mercy because when it's 4AM and you are getting post-liquor hunger pangs, you need them more than they need you!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for fulfill my breakfast craving! Came here on Family day and there was seating room. Our server was friendly and pleasant. So with it to come here for lunch. The pork souvlaki was filling and delicious. Breakfast is always good good for parents with children. The booths can fit the car seat!! Always come here whenever we are in this side of town."}
{"text":"I truly believe that Markham Station is a Scarborough gem. Most of the people I've met who are from Scarborough has heard of Markham Station. Food truly brings people together

I went by again not too long ago and was really surprised at the change of decor! They have renovated their interior to a more classy modern feel compared to their previous decor which gave the impression of an old-school diner. But I really really like the new decor and am happy this place is upgrading because I would be sad if Markham Station ever closes down.

Before 10 or 11AM, they have a $6 breakfast special that always fills me up and leaves me satisfied. It comes with the same ol' breakfast deal anywhere - 3 eggs, choice of sausage, ham or bacon, with home fries (you can switch this I believe) and choice of toast.

Service was good, she was attentive to our water and asked us if the food and everything was alright. I do really like the homefries here, probably 2nd to Panagio's. The booths were really comfy and I like how everything seems sparkly and new.

At Markham Station, there is also a take-out area which you can go in, order and there are a few seats available for you to eat your takeout in there as well. The take-out area has a seperate entrance from the dining area. They also have a bar area which closes around 1-2AM, I believe.

Markham Station is also 24 hours, so sometimes I'll come by for a late night snack... heehee. For those who haven't been to Markham Station, I really recommend that you do!"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've eaten here, but first time since they've renovated. There's lots of choice here so there shouldn't be any problem finding something to eat.

Came here at 12:30pm on a Saturday and was able to get a seat right away. Ordered the eggs (sunny side up) with sausages and home fries. Toast is deliciously buttered, but today the home fries weren't as crispy as I'd like them to be. 

If you want all day breakfast, you can't go wrong with this place. To get the best value, make sure you get there before 11am. 

The service is lacking though as we had empty glasses for quite a while. When I asked for more water, they only gave us one glass. And left the other glasses empty. 

4/5 for food and value
2/5 for service"}
{"text":"If you like to get heart attack from eating breakfast. This is the place to go.

It use to be good like 15 years ago. Now this is just a hole. 

Even they say breakfast special $3.99 you bill will usually come up to 10 bucks per person. 

The whole place smell like you are in the kitchen. After you finish your meal you will want to go home and change. Unless you like walk around smelling like breakfast. 

:-)"}
{"text":"If you get here before 11am, breakfast here is super cheap and delicious (you really cannot go wrong with breakfast food anyway). Generally, I drop by here when Cora's is too crowded, because there's so much more seating here.
However, the reason I only gave this restaurant a 3 out of 5 is because, in my experience, service here is really hit or miss. One day I'll get an amazing server that's kind and friendly, and the next day I'll be waiting for 10 minutes to be seated (when the restaurant is practically empty). Otherwise, they have a solid all day breakfast menu and after renovations, a nice and bright interior. Will probably come again for an early breakfast."}
{"text":"Typical breakfast/brunch place. Food was decent nothing extraordinary. This place is hyped a lot of people go here and can be busy. The price is average and service is okay."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday morning for some breakfast with friends and it was pretty busy. The one thing I noticed quickly is how all the servers seemed to be running around like chickens with their head cut off. I guess that means it's always busy? I thought to myself that's a good sign! Ugh how wrong I was. 

The food was meh at best. The breakfast menu wasn't very large- there was like 8 choices or something like that? What seems to be popular here is the breakfast special for $6.99. However, I decided on something different. I believe it was the egg and turkey bacon combo? The eggs tasted like they were from a box, it was gross. The turkey bacon was ok and the potatoes were bland. The one benefit? The food came fast which means you don't wait long but the downfall is the quality is a major sacrifice. 

I wouldn't come here again however it is open 24 hours so you can eat anytime of the day no matter what your upto. I guess that deserves two stars!"}
{"text":"Horrible food but they are open 24hours.
I'd love to say nicer things about this place because it's just down the street from my house, but they really have gotten lazy over the years. 
Used to be good fresh made food, but now everything is premade and not worth eating. 
I suppose it is nice to put in your order and have it in 5 minutes, but the trade off is it was likely made the day before and just tossed on the grill to warm. 

Because it is open all night they are busy when the bars close, but drunk people are not very picky. 
Anyways, about all I would recommend here is a coffee if you are up late, good luck getting a refill though, the staff don't pay much attention."}
{"text":"Me and my bf came here on a Sunday evening. Ordered souvlaki and baby back ribs. My souvlaki was tasty with a lot of rice and salad on the side. However bf said his ribs were kinda dry.

Service was good. Our server was friendly. I did notice it took a long time for her to take the order for the couple sitting next to us. She was apologetic though.  

Decent diner food. I may come back when I am around but probably won't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Been going for years and their breakfast is so good and great price.  Love their dinners as well try their souvlaki dinner had that many times.
JUST A GREAT RESTURANT REASONBILE PRICES AND GOOD HOME COOKING."}
{"text":"Pros:
- huge portion sizes
- relatively cheap food
- 24 hour service
- the wait staff are all very personable and friendly
- relaxed atmosphere

cons:
- dirty place in general
- greasy (though some people may find that a pro)

Overall, I've gone here a few times and it's great for a late night binge with friends. I've never visited during their busy hours, and I've typically gotten their breakfast or fish and chips. The coffee is hit and miss, but if you can get a fresh pot it's quite good. I'll definitely go back when I've got a late night craving for greasy food!"}
{"text":"wow this place is a dump, I was dragged here twice...

once for breakfast only. We came after 11pm, so it was the all-day breakfast price, which was pretty high for a couple of eggs, sausage and fries. It was blah, it was plain old breakfast, what did I expect? the waitress kept forgetting my drink order... Just a cup of OJ please? didn't come till I almost finished my breakfast. nothing special to note, but it wasn't horrible.

So I came back again for dinner (let's just say I will never EVER come back here again) I don't understand why there is so many elderly people dining here when the food is so HARD, GREASY and UNHEALTHY.

My friend said he saw a $16.99 T-bone steak special and wanted to come and try... OK, except we came on a Saturday and it's not on special, so he ordered it anyways for $22.99 ($6 more) I order a half rack of ribs (I have no idea why, since it's NOT a smoke house or anything?)

the meals came with salad or soup and a couple of garlic toast.

The Caesar salad was overly dressed, and the house salad was plain to the max (with your choice of dressing)

The ribs came and it was HARD as a rock! I ate one rib, and my friend tried one and that was it. The home style potatoes was I guess? I've had better ribs from swiss chalet (and I'm not a fan of this place either)

The T-Bone steak was such bad quality I'm not sure if it is SAFE to eat medium-rare? My friend finished it anyways since he was hungry.

Let's just say he had bad news when he talked to me the next day (something like going to the washroom in the middle of the night) and he is usually able to take anything.

This place is dirty and food is gross."}
{"text":"24 hours. Need I say more? This is a hot spot in Scarborough especially on weekend nights & mornings. 

They're famous for breakfast. I'm in love with their home fries, it's probably the reason why I go there. 

I wouldn't suggest take out. Eating in is better, the food only taste good when it's hot!!!"}
{"text":"The super breakfast is always good. But last time I wanted something different and tried the quiche. Big mistake. Small portion and overcooked to the point that the crust was rock hard. Would go back but only for the breakfast specials."}
{"text":"If I am rating just the food.....4 star's. On wait time and service? A generous 3...we were seated right away. But  it took almost 40 min to get our food. The place was clean and was not too loud but maybe they were understaffed in the kitchen? Or it being a Beautiful Sunday morning there was alot of traffic."}
{"text":"Not sure what's happened to this spot but the quality of the food has gone way down. Just left with my meal half eaten bc it was pretty much inedible. After ordering out meals, my gf and I were shocked at how fast our meals arrived, but were disgusted when everything we bit into was cold.. After getting the servers attention, she was kind enough to take them back and and again she was out quickly with our \"new orders\".  These new meals were definitely hot, but the problem was there were the exact same meals we had sent back. The salt and pepper we had added were still there and nothing had moved... 

What kind of restaurant serves their customers cold eggs and then just reheats the dishes.. It's bad enough the food had been obviously sitting for a while, but then to just try to pass it off as new meals is ridiculous.  Needless to say that was my last visit to Markham Station"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. First time being there and I truly enjoyed the atmosphere. Huge fan of Stephano."}
{"text":"Went here for a midnight fix of all-day-breakfast. The food was just alright, but nothing great. My girlfriend had found not only one strand of hair on her plate while munching, but two! As anyone would expect, she lost her appetite right after."}
{"text":"I really like this place!

I have been going to Markham Station for years, I love the breakfast especially because they serve it all day! The service is fast and by now I know most of the staff by name. 

I recommend this please highly."}
{"text":"I went there multiple times. Every time its a disappointment and i can say this is the least disappointing visit so far . Food is outdated and tastes weird. Their fries, bread, and eggs always taste old,dry,and bland. Not the best service too."}
{"text":"I'm Scarborough born and raised. Lots of people swear by this place but don't listen to them. I've been here twice, once at night and once in the morning, and both times were... boring. 

Everyone in the area knows about Markham Station. The spot for night owls needing their fix. I ordered the usual breakfast meal and got something I honestly could've made better at home. The eggs and meat were just ok but the home fries were bad. Worst home fries of any breakfast spot ever. They're so bland! 

Save your taste buds and hit up Honey B instead. It's up the road, also open 24/7, and has better food. Overall Markham Station gets a 2/5"}
{"text":"Food here is always a hit or miss. The food is never good, but could be really satisfying. Very family style cooking, like mama's cooking. They offer a very warm, friendly atmosphere, like how it would be like to go home to a small town. They make you feel right at home. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"Service is very slow. Took 40 min to get our food. It took so long that a couple that came in and ordered after us got their food before us and finished before our order arrived. Our server never acknowledged us during this wait. The food itself is mediocre. I ordered the eggs Florentine, the eggs were cooked the way I like it and the English muffin was toasted perfectly but the home fries had a slight taste of freezer burn and they smothered my dish with hollandaise sauce. When it was time to pay they gave mints with our bill but they tasted stale and one mint came without a wrapper (gross)"}
{"text":"I really don't know what to make of this place.

Every individual element of the service, food, and environment were all fine.  The food was expensive for what it was, though you could argue that having a full 24-hour menu is just going to cost more.  But the whole experience left me with this uneasy feeling that despite the really nicely-done interior, this is the sort of place that randomly puts out really bad food, or really bad service, or both at the same time."}
{"text":"Ordered the Buffalo Chicken Burger on a busy Sunday. Food was mediocre for the price. Caesar salad was pretty decent but they can definitely cut back on the sauce. Nothing extraordinary to describe the chicken burger. I would have considered coming here again since it was an okay restaurant with mediocre food but...

Got charged $1.50 for hot water. Who charges for hot water?"}
{"text":"Love that they sell breakfast all day. I had the french toast and it was really good, the food is not amazing but its good for when you have no where to go at 1 am and you want something other than mcdonald's. The prices are decent as well."}
{"text":"Diner quality food at reasonable prices available 24/7 with friendly waitresses and comfy booths even for twosies. 

Came for their $6.99 breakfast special. Arrived right at 11am but didn't place our orders till 15 minutes later. Luckily, the lovely waitress said that if the paper breakfast menus are still on the table you can still order the breakfast special. 

We ordered:
- Breakfast special with 3 sausages (tastes like Farmer John's breakfast links YUM!), 3 eggs, roast potatoes (nicely seasoned and soft) and buttered toast.
- Eggs Florentine with two toasted English muffins, sautéed spinach and onion (tasted boiled and bland), mozzarella, topped with two poached eggs and hollandaise, served with a cantaloupe wedge and home fries (nicely seasoned with a crisp edges). Had to use Tabasco to pump up the flavor.

A nice option for eating out early in the morning or late at night."}
{"text":"The quality of this place has been going down hill over the years. Its just a cheap place to get a 4.99 breakfast from 6am-11am. Nothing more nothing less.

They do not have debit machines."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for years, but it's nice to see this place is still opened For business....only because it's opened 24hrs.
The place is spacious,  always opened, serves all day breakfast and comfort diner foods. From fish n chips, burgers n fries to souvlaki,  soups and sandwiches. 
Their prices are very reasonable and the portions are always satisfying.......
However....yes however,  their credibility for freshness was uncertain. My bro and I came here Saturday afternoon for lunch, while he had the pork souvlaki dinner, I ordered their one of their favorites,  quiche Lorraine and Cesar salad. At $12.99 the price was reasonable, however when my dish arrived parts of the outer crusts of my quiche had fallen off. At that point my first thought was damn! It must be frozen, and at first bite I was correct, though warm, it was spongy and soggy inside.  The salad was great, and when I questioned my waitress about the quiche she advised it they make their quiche ahead of time and store them in the freezer........ yup...I think next time I'll have to opt for a less fancier and more diner - diner dive type of meal lol. Service was friendly and efficient. ...but still a disappointment."}
{"text":"Actually isn't that bad, you can get a very decent breakfast even when you are a criminal on the run as the place looks to be full the then after hours.  Thats just a joke but the whole plaza if full of Scarborough stereotypes which in small doses can be kind of fun.  Check this place out if you have never been."}
{"text":"Went here after a night out on the town with a group of friends.  Having been to similar breakfast / diner type places, I can't say that I was overly impressed with the food here.  I ordered the cajun burger, which game with fries, and was ok -- it satisfied my hunger pangs without stuffing me, but really wasn't anything to rave about.  I may end up back here to meet up with friends after hours, but it wouldn't be my choice of venue."}
{"text":"To be honest the food was edible for a prison inmate. Service was just as good 
how do places like this stay open?"}
{"text":"I thought about giving this place 1 star but because their breakfast is pretty good I gave it 2. A lot of people are complaining about the food and I'm surprised more ppl are not complaining about the service. There's one server there who sits and chats with customers and she doesn't come around to see how anything is, you literally have to go up to her and ask for whatever you need. And when you want your receipt none of them are anywhere in sight. 

If you have a lot of time to wait for refills your bill etc then this is a good place to go, if you wanna be in and out this is not a good place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Big restaurant, lacks warmth, needs a major facelift

Food: 
1. breakfast speciall. 1/5 , 4.99 special, makes me wish i spent it on Tim Hortons instead. Bread was so buttery that it was no longer toasted, sausages were dry. Display of the food was so unappealing. 

Overal: we found food still stuck on the utensils, will most definitely not be back"}
{"text":"Why do people like this place? The service sucks and the food tastes like cardboard. The price is cheap, but why settle for such bad food just for the price? You're better off going to any fast food joint in town.

I ordered a fruit bowl and all the fruit was old and brown coloured. I ordered a Spanish omelette and it looked like something a 10 year old attempted to make at home for the first time in his / her life. I had the orange juice and it tasted like the cheapest brand of OJ available. If they even used Tropicana or Simply Orange, it would taste a lot better than what they served us.

Mcdonald's is also 24/7 and any item there tastes better than this place. Let's not use the excuse of price here. I've been all over North America and Europe, any \"cheap\" breakfast place I've experienced in the past absolutely destroys this place."}
{"text":"Markham Station, is a restaurant which has been around a long time. Myself and my mother do go here for breakfast on Sundays. I will say, it's great they finally came into the 21st century with their interior decor. It looks very sleek and sophisticated as opposed to how it use to look. Their menu isn't anything special, a typical replica of any other diner in the city. My qualm with the restaurant is that sometimes you see a lot of employees standing around, talking, and it's quite unprofessional especially if their not actually waiting on tables. There is one waiter whom I am not impressed with. He's a bald guy, and can be quite pushy especially if you don't want a side or ask to change your order from a 3 egg meal to 2. The other thing is he will constantly walk back and forth past you while you eat, and honestly, I don't need to be watched while I eat. I had been rubbed the wrong way with him today when I asked for a simple order a BLT just the sandwhich. What I got was a BLT with a side of Coleslaw and Pickle and when I got the bill it cost me $ 9.99 !. I was pretty annoyed that he didn't listen to what I said. They think fries or rice is a breakfast side ?. I think that's just too much food !. Also they claim they don't know how to split a bill unless they have some code to do so ?. Never heard of this before at any other restaurant. There are some nice waitresses though. The girl with the long curly black hair and glasses she works on Sunday knows your order, and is friendly and very accomodating. She deserves a recommend if you go there to order :). Also.. their burger was gross.. I tried it one night and their onion rings are too overly battered and gross.."}
{"text":"Came here for an early breakfast. This was by far the fastest breakfast i ever ordered, no exaggeration it was ready 4 minutes after I ordered. The eggs were poached perfectly. The hash browns were a bit bland, they could use some seasoning. Overall great experience and fast service"}
{"text":"Decent food and great prices. The staff is friendly for the most part. The hostess on Sunday mornings is terrible rude and unpleasant. The frontline of any business is so important as its the 1st impression. She made the experience so unpleasant."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the service was friendly and quick! The new renovations are beautiful, we had a very good experience here and will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Recently moved into the area and was told that i could get a good breakfast at this The Markham Station.

The Good

1. Breakfast starts at $5.99 standard bacon, eggs and toast

2. Large restaurant plenty of spaced out seating unlike most breakfast places where you feel the next table and including the people waiting for a table are sitting on top of you.

3. Plenty of servers that are switched on and to be honest very good at what they do

Well my experience came here on Sunday I was not in the mood for Eggs however the wife had the $5.99 special, asked her how it was and told that it was good pretty standard stuff.

I decided to order a steak sandwich for $11.99 all i have to say is disappointing.  The fries were shoestring not properly cooked and limp.  The steak was overcooked i asked for medium rare and got leather.

For $11.99 the steak used in the sandwich should be bigger not a small fast fry 4oz steak that was served.  The bun used for the steak should not be larger than the meat inside which i must add was overly toasted. Overall my meal was dry and not appetizing at all. Apple juice was overly sweetened.  No selection of decaf teas offered disappointed that they did not even carry Chamomile 

Will i be back probably not breakfast and greasy spoons are a dime a dozen especially within this area.

Oh the three stars are mostly for service"}
{"text":"This place has seriously gone downhill.

I used to come here often, seeing as how it was 24 hours and a good price for all day breakfast. 

The food has gone south. Had the steak and eggs for $13.99 and it was disgusting. I could go to T-Bonez and get an 8oz steak dinner for $13.99. The eggs were really dry. The steak was really dry. Everything was really dry.

Our meals came with toast, and no jam! We were told we had to pay 20 cents per pod of jam. Hello? I think that if you're going to serve toast, the least you can do it provide you one pod of jam. Then charge extra for additional.

The service was bleh too, I mean I guess you sort of expect it from a place like this. But our server asked only one person if they wanted white or brown toast. And then asked another person if they wanted home fries or something else. Aren't you supposed to ask everyone?

Bad experience. Won't come back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast and late night eats. I always enjoy the super breakfast..enough food to last me till dinner! Granted it isn't the fanciest of places, it still gets the job done.
Wouldn't recommend non-breakfast options however.
Price is also very reasonable and staff are generally quite friendly. Weekends are absolutely jam packed so be read to wait."}
{"text":"Not bad if you're looking for late night snack and there's no where to go past 11 pm. However, I have to give it 2 star because it is not sanitary at all. When I was dinning with my friend the other day and since we ordered fries, and when we tried to squeeze the ketchup out of the bottle, there was a dead fly that came out, which is unbelievably disgusting. 

Ugh..."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a breakfast place today when we stopped at the Markham Station. Not happy at all. Food wasn't that great. I was given the wrong item and it was not corrected or apologized for when brought to their attention. I would never eat their again."}
{"text":"Food is okay but man it felt like I took off 5 years off my life after eating the onion rings. The batter was thick and soaked in oil. I rather they have less batter and be sliced then so they are more crispy. These were like super huge onion rings. The burger is on par with Harvey's but I think Harvey's burgers are a bit more juicy and thick. I got the banquet burger and it came with cheese and bacon. For about $5 its not bad but found the bacon to be a bit tough and hard like its been sitting for a while. The decor is really old school. It looks like the original signs for the menu were the original ones used from when they first opened and it looks like something from the 80's. Will I be back? Probably not since Harvey's is right across the street but may consider to try their breakfast if I'm really desperate."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the only reason people come here is because it is 24/7 & the items aren't crazy expensive. The food normally tastes bland & as if it was something you could have made at home but came here for the convenience. 

This time we ordered the single burger combo, where you get your choice of sauces & toppings. The combo comes with fries and a small fountain drink. The fries are small, thin & very flavourless. Tastes almost as if they made it in the morning and just left it to serve throughout the day. They put what seems to be ramen noodle seasoning on the fries & it doesn't do anything for it but make it too salty in some bites. The burger wasn't anything special, but it wasn't bad. Be careful with how much toppings you choose to put on as the taste of the patty can easily get lost. The drink was actually really small, as well. However, the price for the whole meal was reasonable at $10.15! The portion was good as well."}
{"text":"Markham Station is a throwback to the good old days when you could get a plate of artery clogging goodness for less than $10. Surprisingly, not much has changed here. If you get in early enough, you get their $5.99 deal which includes 3 eggs, bacon, and potato's, along with anything else they have in their kitchen thrown in for good measure.

Apart from the usual breakfast foods of eggs, pancakes, french toast and omelettes, there's also a good number of more 'lunch driven' options like burgers and sandwiches. The club sandwich is particularly good. It's big, well put together and even comes with a pickle (yay).

If you're in the mood for a traditional breakfast and looking for a Cora's alternative, then I would give this place a try. Just get ready to waddle home with a belly full of satisfaction."}
{"text":"I think my reaction to this place is \"Meh\", but I come back whenever I'm in the area because I like breakfast food.

Staff: It was easy to get a seat, and they took our order quickly but then for the most of the time we did not see our waitress, so getting the bill took some time. But they were not busy at all, in fact the wait staff was chatting with each other most of the time.

Ambience: It felt dirty. The spoon I had was unclean, as if it was licked clean, rather than washed clean. The seats were sticky, and the place definitely looked like it could use some sprucing up. It doesn't have that nostalgic or home-like feel, so it just felt drabby.

Food: It was alright. I had ordered their lunch special where you get toast, eggs, sausage or bacon, and home fries. I wanted over-medium eggs but they came as over-well. I opted for sausage which were nice. They only had strawberry jam to go with your toast, which was disappointing. Overall it was nothing too memorable but I was full by the end of the meal. Also, apparently hot water is like $1+, which I didn't see in the menu so it was my fault. I do think that it could've been free though.

It's alright, but I wouldn't seek it out."}
{"text":"Terrible service overall need to train there staff in customer service the food is not that great"}
{"text":"I would give this place less than one star if I could. We waited for 20 minutes for a waiter to come to our table and when we called a passing waiter she rudely ignored us and then went on to say how our waitress was coming. Again another 20 minute wait before we called someone over to find someone to help us. The service was terrible and I understand as it was Sunday morning that they would be busy but this was ridiculous."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 24/hr comfort food. I love the retro train station decor and atmosphere. The decor is probably once of the best things about this place. The portions are pretty big for the prices you're paying. The food is as good as any chain diner can get. 
The strawberry milkshake though... this is the milkshake that will bring all the boys to your yard. order this with the special platter that comes with mozzarella sticks, chicken wings, chicken tenders,  and all that jazz. perfect combo before you go drinking or after you're done drinking."}
{"text":"Key Features: Banquet Burger, and the Paintings on the wall.

I've been coming back to Markham Station for the better part of a decade.  Why?  Originally, it was because - when I needed a full belly at three o'clock in the morning, this was the only game in town.  Well, there was Golden Griddle - but Markham Station was a cut above.

24 hour dining has never looked so good.  To this day, I've only been in about 3 or 4 times before 11pm.  My normal Markham Station experience takes place between 2 - 4am.

The staff are great, and seem happy to be there.  Which I've never understood, as they're working at 3 in the morning.  But this is a big plus that not all 24 hour diners will offer.

Next up is the banquet burger.  Throw down some bacon, a moist, juicy, patty, and all the veggies you could want - and you're set.  But then you end up with more fries than you'd see as a separate order in any number of other establishments.  And then they give you a vat of mayonnaise.  If, for some reason, there's not enough mayo, they'll keep hooking you up - free of charge.

Now, the food - and the timing - that's just one small reason to show up to Markham Station.  The other is the large painting on the far wall.  The first time you see it, you'll just assume it's a train, pulling into the station.  Then you start to notice details.  First, little ones (like the giant goose standing on the horizon) then another - some of the people don't have shadows.  The only explanation?  Ghosts.  In the house on the far right - often unseen due to it being blocked by the barricade to the washroom - there is a ghostly black face in the darkened window.

Little by little the horror in this serene scene beings to grow.  And then you notice there are other paintings on other walls.  The more you notice, the more bizarre it all seems.  But then you forget.  And you're back to the burger.

Ohh yeah - and if you get garlic bread with your meal?  Eat it first.  Otherwise it will cut apart the inside of your mouth, once it has hardened, at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"I like the decorations there making me feel comfortable having a meal there. Service was not pushy and the staff are friendly. I kind of like the fact that they offer rice as alternative other than french fries or home fries."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon, and it wasn't too busy around 1pm. 

We ordered pancakes, which were honestly pretty dry, it might've been because they weren't buttermilk pancakes. We also ordered the Spanish Omlette, it was also ok, it had large pieces of green peppers and mushrooms tossed in a tomato sauce inside of the Omlette. 

Out server, Helen was an absolute delight! She friendly, funny, and was so helpful when were were ordering!

They've also recently renovated, and it looks great! 

If you plan on sharing items, they have a minimum charge of $3.00 per person.  So if everyone doesn't order an item, they will charge you a $3 surcharge for the extra person not ordering."}
{"text":"Been to Markham station multiple times before and after the renovation. Always end up going at the most oddest hours. 

The recent renovations are pretty nice, good face lit for the restaurant overall.

For a place that operates 24/7, you gotta give them some slack. You cant be expecting top notch food. Been going for years, the foods been good and for the most part consistent. Home style taste but is a bit bland. Personally I try to gear towards the non breakfast stuff, like Greek diners, sandwiches, chicken mains, etc. 

Recently went with some friends, forgot the menu item name but got some sunny side eggs, chicken breast, and fries. They got the regular breakfast items. everything was cooked well. The food tasted as you would expect. Grilled chicken breast tasted like it was seasoned with just salt and pepper. 

But doesn't bother me cause its 6am, been awake for almost 20hrs, everything's closed, there's dew on parked cars, McDonalds is switching their menu so they wont serve, the city's waking up and I am eating something that's fresh and doesn't taste entirely like cardboard. For me that good enough. Good food that's always available.

Overall 4/5. Only negative would be the inconsistent service."}
{"text":"I normally like these kinds of places, but this place disappointed me.

Had the station fries cheese (fries with monterey jack cheese, plus a small container of gravy). The melted cheese was already cold by the time we got it. The gravy they gave us was far too small. There was nothing special about the fries. I don't think this dish was worth the money. Reviewing the menu now, I didn't even know it was supposed to have bacon!

My main was a light caesar burger. The burger patty was slightly burnt. The caesar dressing was watery and had little taste. The burger came with lots of toppings including lettuce, pickle and tomatoes. The burger bun was cold. Overall, also a disappointment.

The food also took a while to come out. At least service was friendly.

I'd only come back again if I was hungry and it was the middle of the night and everything else was closed. Actually, maybe not - I'd just go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning - wasn't that busy. Was a little skeptical about the place when I first approached it and saw the exterior - but it was evident that they did upgrades on the interior. 

Fiance and I ordered the Super Breakfast (3 eggs, 3 pancakes, 3 strips of bacon, 3 sausages, home fries) and the Breakfast Special (3 eggs, 3 sausages, home fries and toast). 

We usually go to Sunset Grill for breakfast on weekends - but we changed it up and came here. It wasn't that bad.. food came out really fast, the eggs were cooked perfectly. However, the pancakes were a little too dense, I like my pancakes fluffy. As for the sausages, it was a little too salty and too overcooked. Bacon was cooked well - not too crispy.

Would most likely come back again in the future."}
{"text":"My family and I shared a breakfast wrap with home fries ($8.99) and a Greek salad which came with garlic bread ($10?). The wrap was pretty good but basic, it had eggs, bacon, shredded cheese. There were plenty of Homefries which were good as well, not too oily, I believe they were baked not fried. The Greek salad was a large portion and the dressing was very fresh tasting. The coffee was better than I thought it would be, $2.50 I think with free refills. 
The service was quick and friendly (came at around 3pm weekday though), decor was modern, tables and washrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Okay, this is not some fine, dinning establishment. This is a diner. Not only that, but apparently it's a 24 hour diner, so that's pretty frigging awesome. Good to know. Those come in handy.

As a diner, it's food was perfectly acceptable and actually very good. The service was excellent! Prices were decent. I don't know what else you need!

I came for lunch with a ground of friends. We wanted drinks, we wanted food, some wanted breakfast food (they have all day breakfast...also awesome) and this fit the bill perfectly. 

Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating and fast with the food and drinks. She split up all our bills for us, with no problem (so many places it's like the biggest deal ever). 

Everyone enjoyed their food and we certainly got a variety of it. All large portions. Drinks were good, so no complaints there! 

The atmosphere is...well let's call it quaint. It has some dated decor and paintings on the wall of a sort of olden-days train station. It's a diner, so it is what it is!

Only criticism of this place is that it only takes cash. They have an ATM in the front, but be prepared. 

Otherwise, I would totally come back to this place! They made one mean grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"Use to be good, used to be my favourite.  Now...forget it.  The servers are rude and the food is disgusting."}
{"text":"Okay, let's be clear here. We're talking about a 24 hour breakfast restaurant that happens to sell other items cleverly disguised to be viable options at lunch and dinner.

If you're on your cell phone and you're looking for a plateful of food and just need to get your grub on then you've found your mecca. Any of the breakfast menu items found on one side of the paper placemat menu will do. All you have to decide is how much cholesterol you're in the mood for.

Servers are pretty quick here and when it's busy there's a reason for that - they want to get you in an out as quickly as possible.

The decor has all the charm of the lower deck on the Titanic. I always laugh at the barrier between booths that are side by side. This piece of wood that is elbow height can be removed to make the booths feel more like one unit. Someone put time and effort into this but it really doesn't improve any scenario when removed.

TO SUM IT UP: Come here and get breakfast any time of the day but don't be dissuaded of the book by its cover."}
{"text":"What can I say. Markham station is alright. They seem to be more charming/the food tastes better during those twilight hours, and I've heard service doesn't suck as bad as it does during the daylight. Yes, it IS because your ham showed...

I usually go for their souvlaki - which is overpriced, 14.99 for pork and a whopping 17.99 for chicken. Yikes. But, you do get a fair amount of food, and the skewers of meat are quite nicely broiled and charred. I got the pork just yesterday and was quite satisfied - it comes with generously dressed Greek salad, a serving of rice, a really good amount of tzatziki and their fabulous marinated potatoes, the pork was also flavorful and a delight to eat.

Their menu says \"30 minute seating limit\" in fine print (lulz WHAT?)

For $2.39 you only get one free refill with your coffee (Really?)

Their orange juice is basically puddle water.

And their service is shitty, slow and sub-par.

Figures because Scarborough is wasteland."}
{"text":"Markham station of 2017 is not the markham station of the past. Now only have they revamped their interior they have done wonders to the menu. Much cleaner and tidied  interior with brand new fresh booths and a menu that's much more updated .

We went Saturday evening for the breakfast and it was delicious. Everything was fresh and made to order and the service was awesome. Highly suggest for a quick bite to eat or if your craving breakfast foods!"}
{"text":"Man if you come for their breakfast specials from 6am to 11am for 5.99 this place is definitely a 5*. Their food is good and where else can you get so much breakfast food for only 5.99??? I believe it comes with 3 eggs 3 sausages 3 bacon, home fries and toast. 

I've never made it up for that but I have come here for brunch a bunch of times and the food is really great normally as well. I'm surprised at the low rating since this place is huge and seems to always have a very decent amount of people dining in it at any time in the day. Actually maybe it's because most of it is old people and they don't use Yelp..

Only thing is sometimes I crave peanut butter and they don't carry it. But whatever. Also, the servers are generally quite nice too."}
{"text":"Their Big Breakfast came with Three Eggs, Beacon, Sausage, homemade fries and pancakes.  Don't know why i am quite hate that all breakfast place love to put orange on breakfast plate.  Is not that i don't like
to eat. it just the orange put on top of the pancake or meat it just taste awful.  Their Breakfast was boring and eggs all overcooked.  My friend ordered an peacan ham wrap.  The outlook was nice but taste not
good at all.  Total cost $36 WOW"}
{"text":"Always good food. Standard fare. Quick service. Ask for Natasha, she's the sweetest lady to serve you. 

They have brekky specials so take advantage! 

24h service!"}
{"text":"This is one of two 24 hour restaurants that I know in the area are open. Such a convent place to go if you get hungry during the night. Accessible by ttc or car. Food is good , they have two sides to this restaurant. One side is the bar and the second side is the sit in restaurant. The bar side has tvs. This location has just recently been updated it looks really nice. Service is usually good. And food is usually quick. Their menu has a wide variety of foods to choose from for decent prices."}
{"text":"I used to work in Scarborough. It was nine years ago. My colleagues and I used to come to this restaurant. I have not been back until today. 

The outside of the restaurant looks the same. I got a decent parking spot and walked in. 

The restaurant's interior got a makeover. Gone are the bluish-green booth seats that looked like they were from the 60's. Instead, the interior looks modern and classy. 

I was hungry. I was going for lunch at nearly 5 pm. I went with the super breakfast. I love a good all-day breakfast. The super comes with three eggs the way that you'd like them, three pancakes, three sausage links, three slices of bacon, a cantaloupe wedge, and your choice of rice, roasted potatoes, or home fries. I went with roasted potatoes. I like that there wasn't any toast. I would have exploded if I got some!

Service was fast. I got my food in less than ten minutes. I also got a Diet Coke to wash my meal down. It was good. Perhaps more grease than I'm used to, but it was yummy. I loved the roasted potatoes. They are those that you expect when you order souvlaki. 

The downside was the washrooms. Three tight stalls are there. Only one person can use the sink. There is little space to open the door to get out. It's cramped. 

I'd come back again for a quick meal. The hours are decent and I liked the prompt service.

{"text":"The worst place I've ever been to. To start, a busser splashed dirty water at my friend and I. They apologized so we let it go. But they didn't even give us napkins after we got wet.

When they sat us at the table, there were crumbles all over the seats and oil stains everywhere. I had to go to the washroom and get toilet paper and soap to clean it myself.

Our server was nothing special. She did not smile. She got us refills but she has not really present. We tried to ask other servers for service to order or napkins only to get yelled at. One server said in an angry tone that they are very busy and to go ask someone else because there are different sections.

This restaurant has below average food. The servers are terrible and don't smile. There is no sense of teamwork what so ever. Every server is for themselves here. They do not prioritize the guest's needs. Rather they put themselves first.

I have worked in a restaurant for 5 years. I noticed that the servers had a 5-6 table section on labour day. They do not walk that fast. They do not have full hands in and out of the kitchen. I will not be coming back here. This server even yelled at my friend and said she does not understand how the restaurant works. 

A tip: bring a raincoat because they will splash dirty water at you."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips. The servers are nice except for the one guy. Very greasy food so don't expect to leave feeling healthy, but you will feel full!"}
{"text":"Basic place.
Good food.
Good service.

They charge for a cup of hot water here because people ask for hot water and bring their own tea bags. What do you expect in Scarborough anyways? Ghetto

Disgusting washroom on a late Monday morning....and that was the womens washroom.  Looks like it wasnt cleaned in 2 days.  Had to tell the staff to go give it some attention."}
{"text":"So, if you're from Scarborough, you know about Markham Station. The location has done a number of upgrades with their decor and their food. 

The decor makes the place look much more modern. It was apparently done in August 2016 (this year) so it looks all clean and nice. The staff is usually as friendly unless you get them during the club rush at 3am.

The food looks like it was upgraded in certain areas as well. My friend got the Steak and Eggs, and it looked good. The Fish and Chips I had looked like a step up as well. HOWEVER, it tasted similar to how it has been for years. Its decent, and can hit the spot when you're hungry (its 24 hours). But not a place to go out of your way for. 

I give it an A-OK since I have been going here for many many years. It is infamous in Scarboruogh for the years of fights that used to occur there. We can all tell stories about this place. Cops would always be there eating/coffee as a deterrent. Upgrades may be good, but it is to soon to determine it it should rank higher. But it is a staple of the east end, especially if you grew up on these streets."}
{"text":"This place is horrible the little Indian man at the cashier has no type of customer service skills he ignores you and gives you attitude once you've paid lol they show a regular size McDonald's cup drink in the picture and give you a small Dixie cup once you've cashed out we didn't even want the combo!! talk about bamboozled . My man liked the burger but I think it all looked shit every time I ate a French frie I got sadder sadder . The gravey was disgusting as well and was like salty sorta tasted like curry yuck ....this place should be scheduled for demolition cause I give it a -0"}
{"text":"This is my go to place from 3-5am if i don't want fast food or chinese.

usually i'll order the pork souvlaki dinner. its a pretty big serving so i know im not leaving hungry.

omelettes are great too.

servers are very kind and friendly. it's usually not busy when i go, so service is pretty prompt.

this place has been around for years and years and years, and it shows. a renovation may do wonders for them."}
{"text":"Note: This review is written based on my experience at the take-out portion of the restaurant. The experience dining in may be, and likely is, different or perhaps more impressive.

Being in a rush, we popped in here to get some quick grub - for this purpose, this place did the trick. Ended up ordering a \"Banquet Burger,\" that had a good amount of bacon, but a kraft singles slice of cheese, on a frozen patty. I liked how they allowed you to order from a decent selection of toppings. Since I wasn't expecting a gourmet burger for take-out, I don't have too many complaints here - would still go for Harvey's those at that quality and price-point.

The onion rings, I must say, were amazing here. This surprised me, as they were perhaps the best onion rings I've ever had - thick, juicy, crispy, and plentiful. I'll come back for the rings if I'm in the area, but probably not for anything else."}
{"text":"Updated to add that the new decor is beautiful but please bring back the edible salad bowls!!!"}
{"text":"If you're hungry for good food....then don't eat here!!
I think they have a monkey cooking at night - always terrible and the fountain Coke tastes like boiled shoe water.  

Not sure what the funky taste on the bacon is from, but then they fried the eggs in the bacon grease and Jays all I tasted on them and the fried tater tots. 

Tried to drown my sorrows in the toast...1 slice is toasted and the other was just warmed - WTF!!

What a total waste of time and money, never eating here again."}
{"text":"How I ended up at The Markham Station Restaurant?

Nothing is open on a Sunday before 7 AM for breakfast!! I called Eggsmart....Cora's... nothing is open aside from The Markham Station.. but they never really close anyway??

$4.99 All the Breakfast cheap...but not the breakfast I would like to have often.. maybe I might go to MacDonald instead.... yes it was that bad!!

Sausages dripping in oil... I guess they deep fried them?? When I bite into one.. the oil just dripping everywhere.... The roasted potato though reminds me of potato boiled with tomato paste....which my friend enjoyed.. 

Only 2 free refills for coffee ($2) and minimum charge is $3 per person.. as I can imagine some customers might hang out for hours and try drinking free refills of coffee the whole day.

Services here are lacking, the waitress were all so laidback..and has this 70s small town vibes, which definitely match the atmosphere of the place!

Will I come back?? Probably not? BTW, there is a McDonalds that opens 24 hours just up the street.. just saying....

FYI: CP 24 is ON!"}
{"text":"This is a well known restaurant because it's one of the few places that is open 24hrs in scarborough. This place is only good for hangovers or an after club destination!"}
{"text":"What can I say.. It's Markham Station. I don't come here for a fancy meal or attentive service, I come here for a cheap breakfast once in a while.

It is typically as expected; alright, nothing fancy. Bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Came here to have dinner with a friend. Loved the variety on the menu!! Great portion sizes and great value. 

Staff was a little strange and took some warming up, but other than that was a lovely dinner. 

Would recommend if in the area, but maybe not worth venturing away from downtown."}
{"text":"I am a bit disappointed in my most recent trip to Markham Station. It was around 7:30pm on a weekend night, lots of empty seats. We ordered the Mozzarella Sticks which were really good and I would get those again. However, I ordered the Steak Sandwich which was just a strip of \"steak\" stuck in-between 2 slices of italian bread with lettuce and tomato on the side. HP sauce couldn't fix the bland taste of that steak. My friend ordered the Pork Souvlaki, although they give you a lot of food for the $15, it was not worth it. 

We didn't finish some of our food because of the quantity and the (lack of) taste and the waitress asked us why. Really? 

I would still come back here because it's convenient and just for breakfast, but I will still ignore the staffs' nosey comments."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit after the renovations and loved it! Only complaint about this place would be that once we walked in, we seen a waiter and we said excuse me to get a seat and he called over another waitress to give us a seat? He was a bit rude about it.

Other than that, an Asian woman was our waitress and she was so kind! Checked up on how we were doing a couple of times and provided us the right condiments.. Didn't even need to ask for anything! 

The food was amazing!! I came here often before the renovation and for some reason, even though the prices were good, the food was whatever. Today the food was amazing! I got two eggs, with sausage, home fries & white toast. Craving was def satisfied."}
{"text":"This is your go to place when you don't have any other choice left at 3am lol but really you can come here at any time.  Good is alright, service is good and I like the renovations they made to the place to make it look nicer."}
{"text":"I haven't come here for the breakfast before, but my friends have. Seems pretty standard (but good). I think food wise this place is pretty consistent. It's not amazing, but it's good enough to fill your belly. 

The staff here are laid back and friendly. It's normally pretty busy when I visit, but I haven't ever had any issues with the service.

Going to give it three stars for now as I haven't had any problems and generally had a good time while here."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday morning, and again on Thursday morning.  Both times, decent food, especially the breakfast special.  However both times also horrid waiters--different waiters, but learned from the same school of rudeness--let us stand at the front about 5 minutes while chatting with other employees, then grunted and pointed to a table for us to go to.  Both times the forks were dirty (spoons and knives OK) and we had to ask the waiter to sweep the crumbs off the seats.  We noticed the waitresses were friendly and efficient, but the waiters were the opposite.  We had to go get the waiter to get coffee refills.  Washrooms were tiny and filthy; no TP in the men's.  The first time we tipped as usual, assuming the waiter just had a bad day.  The second time we gave our tip to one of the waitresses who noticed we needed more coffee even though it wasn't her table.  The roasted potatoes were really good, but the home fries were very dry and tasted like they were over baked frozen potatoes."}
{"text":"Came here for a very late dinner in the early mornings around 1am. The food quality is average but for the price you pay, it's quite a good deal. What is great about this restaurant is the service of the waitresses. Everyone is very friendly and makes the meal that much better."}
{"text":"Late breakfast. Ordered the eggs Florentine & the basic three eggs and bacon. Orders came fast. Food was good and service was amazing!  Took the pictures of the food after we had already devoured half of it. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"I came here with the impression that it was just going to be another diner, but I was quite taken aback when I saw it was a full service restaurant.

Came here on a craving for some food and didn't feel like the 24h McD.  So after driving down Sheppard (learned my lesson not to do that next time I go there) I finally found this place that is not quite so little or hole-in-the-wall as I was expecting.

So I decided to order a typical diner type order: steak and poached eggs.  The food wasn't super good, but it is better than a Chinese diner that's for sure.

The price was a bit more expensive (like three times the price of D&R Wing)  for what you get, but then again it's 3:30am so if you need some food  (and much better than that of Metro Square, Olive's Restaurant and D&R Wing) 

The food is also significantly better than the Perfect 24h Chinese Restaurant.

I would likely come back here again if I have a late night craving, probably get the Chocolate Cheesecake (the description on the menu sounds tasty).  However, I don't know if I would go here if other restaurants are still open.  I'll see how it goes on my next trip there."}
{"text":"Not bad, it's like your typical breakfast food. 
It is obvious that they precook your bacon, sausage, home fries and pancakes (well the things I've ordered) and simply cook the eggs when ordered. Our food came out really quickly (5 minutes after ordering). I am not really a fan of that as most of our breakfast places will cook to order - even the bacon and sausages. It's more fresh that way! 
Their coffee however has no taste. 
If you are looking for a cook to order place, this is not the one. If you're looking for a relatively fast, and cheapish breakfast place, then you've found it! 
I would probably not find myself here as it is relatively far for me to get to and I could probably find at least 5 breakfast restaurants before getting there! 
If I was around the corner, I would probably come here more often for their relatively cheap prices. And of course, try their lunch/dinner menu, which I have done years back! 
Also, as a ketchup user, it was really hard getting it out of the bottle!!!"}
{"text":"Gotta pick your battles at this place

Burger and cheese fries. Anything else and you may be disappointed."}
