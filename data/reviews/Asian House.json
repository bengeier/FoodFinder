{"text":"I use Yelp all the time, and decided to try this restaurant because of it's high rating.  I've been to all the Chinese restaurants in the area, and Yin Yin has the best Chinese food I've ever had.  I would highly recommend this restaurant if you feel like having a good Chinese meal!"}
{"text":"This is some of the beast Chinese food in the area. I've tried a lot of different place, this one has the most flavor in their food than any in Madison."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried is super good. Delivery is quick and always good. My go to place."}
{"text":"We order from this place all the time.  It's good, and they deliver in like two seconds after you order.  It's nothing fancy, but it's good Chinese, and they will accommodate your special requests."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for Chinese delivery.  Very quick and polite service.  And the food is really good!  My husband loves the moo-shu pork and hunan chicken.  I love the Singapore mei-fein, seafood delight, or the dragon & phoenix.  Egg rolls and dumplings are good, crab rangoons are just OK. The wonton soup is another favorite, it's super cheap and delish!  We've ordered here several times and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Love the food from here!  My favorite is the Penang Curry Chicken.  It is good and spicy!  I also like that you can order food online.  If you ask for extra spicy they will make it that way."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this visit.  We ordered take out and were told30 minutes.  We gave extra time since the last few times it wasn't ready when promised.  When we arrived 45 minutes later it still wasn't ready and they forgot to make one of our meals. The place is cluttered with junk behind the counter.  Time to find a new Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I brought the family because we have individual tastes and could get the full flavor of the restaurant. The Shrimp Lo Mein was very good. It is my test dish for any new Asian restaurant. The sauce was not too sweet, the noodles were soft but firm. The shrimp and vegetables were cooked very well. My husband had the Tom Yum Keong soup. The shrimp was very decently sized. The mint and the tomatoes added a flavor accent that surprised him. It actually had a spicy bite to it. The mushrooms floated on the top of the soup was perfect in texture. His entree was the shrimp and broccoli Hunan style that actually had some heat to it. He rarely finds anything that has enough heat for his tastes. My 14yo had the Pad Thai. She literally cleaned her plate and wanted more. My 15yo had the shrimp egg foo yung. It was very nicely cooked and the gravy was a good consistency. My son had the General Tso's chicken. The texture was crunchy and not soggy. The sauce definitely had a kick to it. The broccoli was perfectly steamed. I will definitely be coming back here not only for eat-in but take out."}
{"text":"Please be advised that a few months ago the long time owners had retired and the food has gone downhill since then. I miss the old way the food was prepared."}
{"text":"A nice small take out restaurant. The people there are nice  and always seem to have a smile on. As a seafood lover, i ordered the spicy seafood which is a thai dish. Love it, great taste, goes well with white rice. Black pepper chicken is one of kind, i recommend this highly. As for the appetizers, the crab rangoon and fried dumplings are great. Overall a good experience at Asian house. Will recommend."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and 20 minutes for my order to be delivered, and when the driver got there I had to meet him outside. He refused to come to my apartment. Meat portions were small, I ordered a shrimp dinner. 4 pieces of shrimp and minimal beef with my beef and mushroom.  Tasted Okay...."}
{"text":"They're okay, their dumplings are decent and their dipping sauce for it is average tasting. I ordered their Roast Pork Egg Foo Young two times and it always came out too floury so I stopped ordering. If you want good Roast Pork Egg Foo Young you're better off going to Raymond Rd to Chiang Jiang. Otherwise the food here is decent and passable that I would eat here if I didn't want to go very far. They are okay, not the best though."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this two stars at all is because the egg rolls were really good. Everything else -- fried dumplings and pork lo mien -- were almost inedible. Sad. Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I got this on a lazy Wednesday night and I've got to say, it was pretty solid! I was really skeptical at first because of the mixed reviews but everything tasted good and I wasn't sick the next day. The guy who took our order on the phone was very polite and efficient as was the delivery guy. We got Sesame Chicken, House Lo Mein, a pork eggroll and a free order of Crab Rangoons (my favorite!!) after spending $15 on everything else. This could very well become our new go to. We're from the east coast so we're on the hunt for all new places to depend on for nourishment when we just #can't.  The reason I gave 4/5 stars was that the food wasn't hot when we got it. The crab rangoons were a bit cold and everyone knows the key to a great crab rangoon is having it piping hot...well maybe that's just me but I still would've liked the food to be hotter. Still, I'd recommend you try this place!"}
{"text":"had some takeaway based on a review from a friend.  place appears like it was forgotten and a dairy queen built in front of it.  however i must say it's of the better chinese food I have had.  * chicken gen tso was huge chunks and portioned well * fried rice has large chunks of grilled chicken in it * veggies were fresh and crisp  overall for the price it was prob one of the better kept secrets in painesville.  The same family has owned and run it since the 80's.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I think my family has eaten or taken out here at least a dozen times a year since the restaurant opened.   It is fast, friendly, tasty and consistent comfort food.  The vegetables are the right amount of crisp and fresh.  The tofu has body and texture.  The meat is savory and tender.   Are the sauces a little too sweet and a little too salty? (Like most tasty comfort food?) Maybe.  It depends on your tastes.   For my tastes--and for my family--it's a staple.   Don't go expecting a gastronomic \"experience\".   It's great take out...or a great quick meal for a couple on the run, or a parent and kid needing good, solid food, fast.   Go with those expectations and you won't be disappointed.   You'll be sustained."}
{"text":"Seriously the most bottom of the barrel chinese food i have ever had. Like, it tasted so gross i couldn't eat it. Usually i don't expect much from cheap chinese, but this is beyond bad. Even my veggie egg roll tasted like vomit. How can a veggie egg roll be SO bad???   I wouldn't eat this food again if it was free and i was starving."}
{"text":"This was terrible. I just ordered delivery. They get a star because it was quick.  I ordered:   crab rangoon (passable) w/ sweet and sour sauce (had a half-singed piece of paper floating in it)  an egg roll (whatever mystery meat was in it was foul smelling and tasting)  chicken w/ broccoli (the meat was slimy and chewy; the broccoli bitter)  Never again. I ate the rice."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese restaurant masquerading as a Thai restaurant. For Chinese food it is about average, but I still wouldn't really recommend it. For Thai food, it is a far cry from authentic. Go to Little Bangkok in the Strip or Little Nicky's for great Thai food in the 'Burgh. Crab rangoons were not crisp and the \"Dunkin\" Noodles were not really even close to the real thing. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great for what it is! We order from Asian house once or twice a week at work. The delivery is fast, and the food is fresh. They also use the plastic containers, which are much better than the paper ones. My go to Chinese takeout place!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've only ever ordered for delivery and they have been quick every single time. Compared to other Chinese restaurants of similar price, the food is good, better than most. I love their steamed dumplings. Asian House is my go to takeout for fast and affordable Chinese food."}
{"text":"My wife and I were hungry for dinner after a trip to Kennywood so we decided to give this restaurant a try. The first thing we noticed was that even though it says takeout or dine in this is barely a sit down restaurant. They have a few tables at the front of a takeout location, but it's not particularly pleasant place.   The food came out reasonably quickly and was fairly priced, but the quality was very inconsistent. My wife got a veggie curry that had freezer burned peas in it. I had drunken noodles that were ok but unexceptional. This would have been a three star place if it weren't for the terrible peas. Putting nearly spoiled vegetables in your dishes is inexcusable."}
{"text":"It's okay in a pinch.  Still seeking that \"fresh\" tasting Chinese food in Madison.  Portion was adequate, the flavors were not \"knock your socks off\"."}
{"text":"Another in a seemingly endless series of completely shitty, cookie-cuter Chinese restaurants.  The food at this place makes Panda Garden look like a *REAL* Chinese restaurant.  The \"potstickers\" are really \"deep fryer\" stickers and are so glutenous you could use them to plug holes in your boat.  There is nothing even remotely authentic or even edible in this armpit.  Avoid Asian House like the plague. Thoroughly vile.  If you would like a REAL, AUTHENTIC Chinese meal, head over to Ichiban on Park Street.  That place will knock your socks off.  If you ever find yourself thinking about eating here, head up the street to McDonalds where the food is both more nutritious and has more flavor."}
{"text":"This place is a take out restaurant with a selection of Thai food in addition to a full Chinese menu. While the Chinese food I've tried has been pretty good, the Thai is phenomenal. The green curry, it is maybe the best Thai curry I've had in the area. Their pad see ew was excellent. Their food can have some pretty good spice if you get the medium or hot. The prices are very reasonable especially  when you consider that most entrees include a huge amount of food. We love it so much we always get a few extra entrees for the next day. They usually give a free container of iced tea with each order. I am so happy to have found this place!"}
{"text":"This place is fucking terrible I suggest not getting delivery cause the fucking delivery  driver harasses you for tip I almost had to call the cops fucking g get your shit together"}
{"text":"Not good food. General Tsos chicken and sesame chicken were indistinguishable. Steamed dumplings are actually gross. Fried rice seems to be purchased as is and then steamed."}
{"text":"After our favorite Chinese place closed we went on the hunt for our next go-to-place! This fits the bill.. reasonable, delicious, fresh and fast!   We enjoy the steam dumplings, chicken dishes and lo mein."}
{"text":"Better than average. Your average Chinese takeout place but I've noticed their quality to be better than most places. Their General Tso's chicken is hot and crispy and boneless ribs are the most tender out of all takeout places I've been to. Service has always been really friendly and they don't skimp out when you ask them for your meal to be extra spicy. I'll always order here when I'm in the mood for cheap Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"I love this place. Hands down best chinese i have had in pittsburgh so far. It is fresh and always good. Staff is nice and they have a few tables so you can eat inside. Prices are very good. Only thing stopping 5 stars is no boneless spare ribs but there general tso is amazing so i get that w the special lomein."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town! Harry used to own The Golden Palace, on Mentor Ave., in Mentor. His take-out place has kept the original quality, thank goodness. The egg rolls won an award back in the Cleveland Food Fair, days that used to be held at Berea Fairgrounds. Just awsome. Now, I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time. Delivered in less than half an hour. Food was delicious .will come again..."}
{"text":"Ordered for take-out. They answered the phones promptly, were very polite and quick. Only 10 minutes until my food would be ready!  Perhaps it's just me not being familiar with the area, but their location was a bit hard to find. The physical building itself is tucked back without all that noticeable of a sign-I went right by it the first time.   Upon entering I was greeted by two workers-they were so polite! Big smiles on their faces and greeted me very kindly.   Prices here are fantastic-especially for the amount of food you receive! I ordered a large chicken fried rice and the sesame chicken combo.   I truly wasn't impressed with either. Not that they're awful-just lacking in flavor. The chicken fried rice has little bits of onion and chives mixed in with it which was fantastic. I was quite disappointed in the sesame chicken. There's really no flavor to it. Not crisp. It's truly nothing special and I wouldn't order it again.   Reading other reviews, maybe I just caught them on an off night?!  Overall, the customer service outshines the food itself."}
{"text":"My fella and I recently ordered for delivery from here and it was good! The delivery took a little over an hour - which is fine by me. The food came hot so that's all that matters.  We ordered crab rangoons (free with coupon), Mongolian beef, Dragon & Phoenix, appetizer of fried bean curd with garlic sauce. Everything with a $1 delivery fee & $5 tip came to $30 - not bad at all.   The rangoons were okay - best with sauce around the crispy edges. The bean curd was okay as well - lightly fried and decent size pieces, although the garlic sauce, while flavorful, seemed thin. My fella love the Mongolian beef and I too thought the dish had a lot going for it. The Dragon & Phoenix was okay - the chicken was not my favorite so I probably would not get that again but the shrimp more than made up for it. Those were some of the best shrimp I have ever eaten from a take-out place. I definitely would be willing to try some more options from their seafood side.   Also worth noting, the portions were huge! Way more than enough and at a very good price to boot!   I'll definitely go here again the next time I get an urge to eat as much as possible while moving as little as possible."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, very tasty food. Try the steamed dumplings!"}
{"text":"Curry tofu is amazing. Good fresh Chinese better than a lot of takeout places. Disclaimer- have spent a month in China."}
{"text":"They have great food and the prices are great too! Sure they get a little busy at times but that should tell you something about the food!   I am patient and don't mind waiting if needed, they are pretty good at letting you know when they are super busy.  Bourbon chicken is great and I love the General Tso's too. I have not ever had any issues with my order being accurate and everything always tastes amazing. They even make their own homemade duck sauce!  Real Chinese food at a great price - can't be beat in Lake County!  Even my favorite pizza place has a one hour wait, plan ahead and you're fine."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped here after a day at Kennywood.  It is not a sit down restaurant, it is a to go place with a few tables in front, but it is comfortable.  Our food was delicious!  My son had General Tso's and I had Green Curry. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I'm lost at how they are in business.  I ordered food at 1pm and was given a 2:05-2:15 window.  I had issues getting in touch with the restaurant.  Eventually I was told me that I was a \"little bit further\" out than normal.  That was the only explanation given.  Knowing that they should have their systems setup for delivery areas, I have no idea what this actually means.  The food showed up at 3:05 and was cold.  No apology or explanation.  No offer to refund my money.  I can't even talk about the food as it is not even edible.  It's just piles of cold chicken that have been soaking in grease on top of cold eggs in the fried rice with a side of cold, soggy crab rangoon.  I'm done with them.  This was by far the worst delivery experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Asian House. One meal is great and the next is \"meh\". It really does disappoint me that I cannot give this a solid 4-star review, because on it's best days I feel like it really deserves it.   For example:  The steamed dumplings are fantastic. Except when they overcook them and they are falling apart and the sauce is not put in the bag.   The crab rangoons are great! Except when they forget to send them with.  The sesame chicken is the best I have had in the area. Except when it is cooked poorly and has a really funny aftertaste. Same with the General's chicken.  See what I mean? Just very inconsistent.  I still order from them on a regular basis. They are very friendly, the service is good in the store, and delivery is prompt. I just wish the quality control were up to par."}
{"text":"I've had my Chinese delivered by Asian House numerous amounts of times! The food is always great and is always delivered in 30-45 minutes despite that the restaurant is on the other side of town."}
{"text":"Best affordable chinese restaurant in Madison area by far! For added convenience there food can be ordered online for delivery via eatstreet.com"}
{"text":"Simply one of the best Americanized Chinese take aways in lake county.   Excellent service - high quality ingredients and meats. Every single time I get food here everything tastes excellent , I am never missing items and it always well packed so it doesn't end up all over the place.   Everyone should really give it a try as its a quality place."}
{"text":"Looking for a good Chinese delivery in Madison as I am here often for long periods of time. I've tasted Chinese food in several different states. I'm from CA and they have some of the best options there. Their portions are always large too so you get your monies worth for sure. Husbands even tasted it in Hong Kong. So we have places to compare to. Decided to pick up since we were in the area. My husband went in so I can't comment on the service or the restaurant. He said lady was very friendly. Also parking was fine. Right near a Woodmans grocery store.   Food: We received a menu in the mail. Decided to order online. For some reason everything was $1 more! Ordered the large (qt) of egg drop soup. (I do like how they have different sizes for some food!) Walnut shrimp. General Tso's chicken. And used the coupon to receive free crab rangoons since we spent over $15. I'm not too hard to please. I'm the person who doesn't complain when her order is wrong. My order wasn't wrong. Sadly, it just wasn't that good. Both chicken and shrimp were heavily breaded. And I mean heavily. Once I peeled off the breading there was only a tiny piece of chicken or shrimp. The general chicken did have a good taste and wasn't overly saucy like another restaurant we tried. The walnut shrimp tasted like none of the other ones I tried. Basically didn't have much of a taste at all. The filling of the crab rangoons tasted good. But they were so hard to chew. The tops weren't cooked all the way through. Egg drop soup had minimal flavor and oily. Soy sauce and hot sauce fixed the flavor. But I ordered a large and received only a tiny bag of crunchy wonton strips. It was barely enough for 1 person. Overall not satisfied with our meal. I ended up throwing away the leftovers.  We're still on a mission to find good Chinese food the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The search for decent Chinese takeout in Madison continues. The food at this place (we ordered delivery) is nothing worth waiting 1.5 hours for. Greasy vegetable egg rolls which contain nothing but cabbage. Greasy lo mein. They clearly do not understand how to work with tofu, nor do they get how to deliver quality food in a timely fashion. The one plus was the vegetables were still crunchy. Just save your time and money and don't bother. Not even a good dousing of sriraccha can make their ho-hum food sparkle. The reviews I've seen from in-house diners do not provide any contrast to our delivery experience."}
{"text":"I read a few reviews and some said, \"Best Chinese Food in Lake County\".   Well, decided to give it a try.   Walked in and was greeted by a young lady at the counter, who clearly seemed to be having a nervous breakdown because they were so busy.  She took my order, and when I asked, \"How long before I should come back?\" -- she broke into tears and told me they were so busy she had no idea.   I should have left then.   I waited 45 minutes, and then it still was not ready.  The kitchen and the cooks feel cluttered and messy.   Since the kitchen is open to full view, it does not lend itself to a healthy environment.  Regardless I took the order, over an hour later.   Got home, and an entree was missing.  \"Best Chinese Food in Lake County\"??  I would rather travel further for better."}
