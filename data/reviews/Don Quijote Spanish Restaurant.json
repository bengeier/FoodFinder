{"text":"I can't comment on the food or the cocktail.  I've never eaten here and I generally only drink one or two.  But I am a dancer - a Salsa enthusiast.  I have been to many clubs and this one is great for an atmosphere of pure Salsa-joy.  

The live band was Tequila, I think, and played a great mix of classics and new Salsa, Merengue, Bachata, and Cumbia.  Dance partners were friendly, gracious and respectful.  Folks were from a diverse mix of backgrounds which made the dance variety exceptional. 

It had been some time since the last time I was at Quijote's and this refreshed my memory is the most positive way possible!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I think they need to reconsider some of their advertising. I read in a magazine while staying in the area that this was a tapas bar with live music. I show up to a menu of 8 appetizer choices (mostly soup and salads), and 10 entree choices. No tapas, $35 per person. I wasn't willing to pay that amount of money for the choices that were provided.

We opted to move to the bar and drink our dinner, and the band was warming up. I ordered a margarita, and my friend ordered a beer... and I asked what time the music started... 10:00, an hour after kitchen closes. I didn't really want to sit around that long and not eat, but oh well. 

The margarita machine wasn't working, so I had my margarita made in a blender (so, a daquiri). My friend's draft beer was room temperature.

$13 later, I left, and walked down to Milestone's."}
{"text":"I have to be honest. I've never been here for food. I go here when I want to have an earth-shattering, life-altering, mood-swaying good time. And it has yet to disappoint. 

Don Quijote's is where a girl goes to feel like a queen. The people here are truly classy. It feels like you're entering Zorro's layer. All the men have impeccable manners and they don't think twice before sweeping a girl off her feet with the Tango, Meringue or Salsa. 

Your drinks usually get paid for by some complete gentleman and everyone is truly there to have a good time. 

Want to be whisked away into a fairy tale? Hop on your donkey and head over to Don Quijote's."}
{"text":"I didn't go here for food.  I went here with a friend for a salsa lesson.  The instructor was a Cuban who knew his stuff.  He spent most of the hour teaching us a combo in merengue, and then teaching us how to do the combo in \"salsa\"---I think he was actually teaching us casino.  

All in all, it was a fun lesson."}
{"text":"I'm upgrading my review after a pretty decent time here last night.  It wasn't as crowded as it often is, the music was a lot better than it had been the couple of times I'd previously checked it out, and the sleaze factor was relatively low.

Bottom line: I figure it's still pretty hit-and-miss, but if you check in advance to see which band is playing (Grupo Tequila is a lot of fun!) and which DJ is on, and if you go with a group of people you enjoy dancing with, and if you luck out on the crowd, it can be a decent night."}
