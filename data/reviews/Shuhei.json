{"text":"Spending couple weeks in Cleveland, decided to explore local sushi one night.  Ended up at Shusei.  Sushi and service was great, a little pricier than $$ though.  Shusei is a little more upscale and $$$ is probably more accurate cost rating.  Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Excellent \"traditional\" sushi Restaurant. Very fair pricing - not cheap, not too expensive. Classic dishes - if your looking for newfangled maki rolls with oddball ingredients, this is no the place for you. But if your looking for traditional maki, sushi, sashimi, this is the best place I've found to so far in Cleveland. They also have a large menu of other traditional Japanese dishes on the menu. 

Atmosphere is a bit dated but I've never had a bad experience (20+ visits). Service is very good."}
{"text":"We had high hopes when we saw 4 star rating. Reviews looked good. However my experience was not great. Service was slow even at the Sushi bar with 3 chefs attending. Food didn't seem real fresh. Menu nothing fancy. The decor is dated.  The soy sauce bottles are dirty. The atmosphere is dull. We had 1 beer, 1 hot saki and 12 pieces of sushi and the bill came to $100 including tip. Won't do that again."}

I happened to be visiting Ohio and decided to stay in the Beachwood area. I had a craving for sushi and Shuhei was very close to my hotel. The Shuhei Restaurant is located in the ground floor of an office building. I arrived and finished my meal just before the dinner rush which consisted of men and women in business wear. The staff wore traditional Japanese Kimonos and the Kimonos themselves were actually very pretty. The interior was very cozy, and there was even a private area where diners could sit and enjoy their meal on the floor in a traditional manner. I ordered a bowl of miso soup, a yellow tail roll and the Hot Bahama. The Hot Bahama roll was their own creation and it contained clam, hot sauce, fish roe and mango. The miso and the yellow tail roll were both very delicious. The Hot Bahama was just decent. It sounded good in theory, but the flavors just didn't mesh well for me. The prices at Shuhei were good too. I didn't feel like I spent much on my meal. If I were living in the area, I would definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"I was a regular fan of this restaurant until Valentines day. They overbooked causing people to wait over 30 minutes past their reservation for tables (many people walked out). We didn't get served for another hour and a half after we were finally seated. When I called the manager the next day, he did not care that so many people had a bad experience that night nor that there was a buzz about how Shu Hei handled it nor that I wouldn't be returning anytime soon. I understand that restaurants can have an occasional bad night but not that management doesn't care about their customers. Sorry Shu Hei, I will miss you but not enough to be treated that way! Bye!

{"text":"I will be leaving Cleveland in 2 months from now. I'm born and raised in Toronto; I was living in NYC prior to moving to Cleveland. I'm not a food snob but yes I have eaten great food and I love good food. I have to say this place was a lifesaver when I first moved to Cleveland and was looking for good food! I discovered this place 3 years ago, it's on Chagrin Blvd behind an office building, difficult to find the first time.  It seemed very low key.

Things I love about Shuhei:
1.) Staff has always been very accommodating and very nice people.
2.) The environment was very comfortable, relaxing. It's a great place to bring friends or even a date. Despite how relatively small the place is, there's not much background noise at all.
3.) Food is great. They are relatively consistent with the quality of their sushi/sashimi which is what I mostly eat. I have tried their noodles as well and appetizers which I do enjoy a lot as well. 

I'm def going to make a couple more visits before I leave!"}
{"text":"I heard from several people how good this place was, but it was just meh.  We got there later at night and the hostess looked annoyed to see us.  The first thing that should have alarmed me is that nobody around us just ordered sushi.  We did, and when it came, I was underwhelmed.  We usually order two regular rolls and a special roll, and none of them were overly special. The commonality was that the rice to fish ratio was heavily skued towards the rice, which made it so we could barely taste the fish.  Furthermore, there was too much sauce or extras in the roll, which again took away from the taste of the fish.  For example, we ordered a yellow-tail and green onion roll.  There was so much green onion that it left my mouth burning.  I decided to give a roll with some hot sauce in it a try, but again, there was so much hot sauce that it overpowered everything else.  Last, the rolls were literally falling apart.

What really bumped this review down was the service.  I was there with a vegetarian friend.  She ordered an appetizer with tofu,  immediately tasted fish, and stopped eating.  Nearly twenty minutes later, when we finally saw the waitress again, she asked and was told that it was a fish breading.  This hadn't been on the menu, and I think that my friend rightfully assumed that a tofu dish would be vegetarian, or otherwise, it would be marked on the menu as a non-vegetarian dish.  Another restaurant would have comped the dish due to the mix up, especially since my friend didn't eat her appetizer.  Instead, it was left on the bill and she paid for it, because we decided it wasn't worth the hassle.

Overall, the combination of merely ok sushi and poor service means I likely won't go back.  As a New Englander, I am spoiled by superior fresh-fish sushi, and I still haven't found a restaurant in Cleveland that comes anywhere close to what I'm looking for -- guess I will continue to look."}
{"text":"JANO, the Japanese Association of Northeast Ohio, holds it's monthly meeting here if that tells you anything."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here.  Its that good.  Even after 18 years we've been going. Had saki,  few different rolls and beer.  Everything is top notch and the service is to match.  Sushi is so fresh tasting and the tempura is fantastic too .  If you're in for slow dinner just know service move fast.  Just mention you're taking your time for dinner and they slow it up.  Could eat it everyday."}
{"text":"I say two stars because the people were nice. 
That aside, I have been to a lot of Japanese restaurants and I went here because of how well it was talked up, its location and sadly assuming the prices reflected the quality of food.  Makes me wonder how many other places the reviewers have gone for Japanese food because this place tasted like they have no reference level.

Let me start with the fact I came here for an anniversary dinner.  Big mistake. 

The regular sushi rolls were the smallest I have ever received at any restaurant I have gotten sushi.  The quality of the fish wasn't that great for the price, but hey, I know this is important, the rice was good.  But MARKET DISTRICT offers bigger pieces of sushi.

The service was bad.  I am wondering if that was a reflection on our persons because everyone else there seemed to be on a first name basis and dressed exceedingly well ( which isn't a shock given the area ).  Our service was not good and there weren't even that many people there.  One of the rolls I ordered was never entered even though the waitress repeated back what I asked for.  And I've waited less time for beverage refills at incredibly busy morning breakfast places.

The donburi combo bowl of tuna and sushi, for its price and quality, was laughable.  I don't know what they think they are selling, but it wasn't worth what I paid.  And I regret my entree.  The Koren Chirashi sounded like a good idea, like cold Bibimbop, and it was.  However, the hot sauce that goes into it over takes your pallet and you can't ever appreciate the fish.

And my girlfriend the following morning does not feel well in the way you feel bad after eating bad food, and that was the last thing she ate that day.

The \"Too Long, Didn't Read\" of this is
The prices are a joke for the portions and quality and are most likely what they are for the area.  The overall experience was very disappointing and I 100% would not go back.  I regret not taking us to our regular favorite and significantly better Japanese restaurant.

Thanks for ruining our evening."}
{"text":"This place had a very fantastic array of sashimi!!! The order time was very very quick and everything came out within the hour not to mention that they had almost a full dining room. Very impressed by the service."}
{"text":"I am impressed with the ambiance , this is the only place in cleveland where servers wear kimono! Tempura, sushi, udon are great!!"}
{"text":"Had a variety of sushi rolls and sake & beers.  The food was very good and priced how you would expect.  The service was a little bit on the slow side, but nothing to complain about.  It was a good experience.  They have a large menu that could cater to most dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"This is consistently the best sushi I've had in Cleveland! Everyone is always friendly and the service is quick. We usually have a seaweed salad, a few sashimi orders and some rolls. We haven't tried the other dishes yet, but we plan to on our return visits."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and am in the search for a good sushi place. I love raw tuna and am very particular about the quality of tuna. The quality of tuna here was good, however, I will never go back. I have never been to a sushi place where you can't customize the rolls. I ordered the spicy tuna roll which was okay but the rolls were a little too big. The other item I attempted to order and was shot down on was a California roll with tuna on top. When I tried ordering this the waitress just argued with me explaining how sushi is made. I know how sushi is made, I've been eating it for 15 years. She said they couldn't put tuna on the California roll because it is rolled. I told her that I know, I just want it either rolled with it or on top of it. She didn't even consult one of the sushi chefs to see if this was possible, she just said no. I have ordered this at many other sushi places in the past and have never had an issue. The search continues for a good sushi place..."}
{"text":"This is a relatively inexpensive sushi restaurant that I've been going to for over seven years. In these 7+ years, I've NEVER had a less than satisfactory dish. Every single dish I've had is unique in its own way.
My favorite dishes include:

Hokai Maki (Grilled Salmon Sushi)
Ebi Ten Maki (Avocado and Tempura Shrimp Sushi)
California Roll (Avocado and Crab Stick Sushi)
Tempura Shrimp and Tempura Vegetables
Chicken Yakitori 
New York-Style Cheesecake
For those of you who haven't give Shuhei 5 Stars, just because some of the waiters/waitresses weren't Japanese, I don't see how that should take away from its friendly and quick service.


If you're looking for a delicious, healthy, restaurant with quick and great service, Shuhei is a phenomenal choice.

{"text":"This is a solid sushi restaurant!  Fish is always good and their rolls which run middle of the road between traditional style and fusion are almost always good.  If you get a chance, order the Miki-moto roll which is not on the menu!  Super good and a regular order for me!"}
{"text":"If you love sushi this restaurant is the best. No other place compare. Service is always tops and for the quality this price is fair
Try there salmon. It's phenomenal"}
{"text":"We stopped by Shuhei because we were in the area and craving some yummy sushi. When we first arrived, the location of the restaurant was a bit confusing to find from the front parking lot. But once we realized it was in the basement, it was easy to locate. The inside of the restaurant was lovely and decorated tastefully. We enjoyed the dark blue walls and dark wood touches. Plus, the female staff is dressed in traditional kimonos which is a nice touch. 

We ordered the fried Gyoza as an appetizer which came out with a spicy red pepper soy sauce and it was delicious. Nicely fried on the outside and tasty beef in the inside. For our main entree we shared the Anniversary roll, David's special and spicy crunchy tuna. By far, the Anniversary roll was most delicious. The service was fine and our server was very friendly. Although we went during lunchtime which wasn't as busy, so we cannot say for sure how service would be during busy dinner rush. 

We tried leaving a tip for the sushi chef but didn't find a tip jar, so we left it on the counter. Kinda awkward, but the chefs appreciated it nonetheless. We will return if we are ever in the area."}
{"text":"We went back here this week and I found it to be way overpriced for the food. The meat dishes did not have substantial amounts of meat for the price. We will not go back here with a large group. Maybe for a date night."}
{"text":"We picked up takeout at shuhei, and We found three coarse , black, hairs woven in the crunchy spicy tuna roll. When I called to complain the manager \"rick\" said \"that could not have happened here\"
when i insisted it did, but not in the yakisoba noodle dish or California roll, he asked me to bring in the hair!!  
WHAT MANAGER ASKS FOR THAT?! WE ARE A 35 minute drive ONE WAY to this restaurant...
Filthy place and poor customer service. I did not bother wrapping up the eyebrow hair and driving back..."}
{"text":"Our first adventure to Japanese food outside of San Francisco, CA since our relocation to Cleveland.  We were not disappointed.  The food was authentic with absolute richness and perplexity.  We did not try the sushi but each had cooked dishes that were amazing.  We will definitely be coming back here to try more of their large menu."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service. Had dinner this past Monday and thoroughly enjoyed everything. Very authentic environment. Sushi was fresh and the mushroom with crab was amazing. It's located in the basement of a office building so I really like that it's off the beaten path"}
{"text":"Food below average, service was totally lacking, and atmosphere dated. I was dumbfounded that this place had a four star rating"}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is nice. I especially liked the waitress we had she was very nice and they were all wearing Japanese clothing. I would highly recommend it. The fish was very delicious. The pricing is reasonable. I just wish they had more locations. I recommend the yellow tail sashimi if you like sushi."}
{"text":"Good place for sushis, very fresh and good price. The service is good and the decoration of the restaurant is nice too."}
{"text":"We were in the area and craving Japanese food, and Shuhei delivered.  The service is friendly and quick.  We ordered an assortment of sushi and sashimi, and everything was fresh and brought out in a timely manner.  Our waitress really helped us navigate the menu and order a perfect amount of food.  They also have great seafood entrees!"}
{"text":"I have to agree that this is the best sushi place in town!! We went there with extremely low expectations after the trying so many sushi places in Cleveland and they all ended up as disappointments. I was so glad we found the place after driving around Beachwood searching for it for 20 minutes. The food was amazing, friendly staffs and very casual ambience, the type of place you can stop by for relaxed dinner wearing scrubs on your postcall day.

We ordered the chirashi (the raw fish version), ika nigiri, agedashi tofu and zaru soba with tempura. Everything on the chirashi rice was super fresh and tasty. I think they make the rice just at the perfect level of sourness, goes perfectly well with the fish on top of it. The soba and tofu tasted authentic and good as well, although not as quite comparable to the sushi. 

Highly recommend this place especially if you're a hardcore sushi lover!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for sushi or bento style box and its good, just a bit overpriced.

Also, the bar is depressing so I would not plan on doing that here."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Sushi restaurant in Cleveland. I'm going to butcher the spelling of this, but please order the cu cucumber Kani Maki. Not on the menu but so good!! Always fresh tasting. Always clean. Woman's bathroom smells really good, lol. It does! Servers are very attentive. I go here at least 3times a month."}
{"text":"Good, but quality and service has declined after Eugene Em's departure for Table 45."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this resauant for ovet 20 years.  When I think about that... it's crazy.  I have seen the same servers there for equally as long.  We have all aged together :).  

Exterior/Location: In the back of an office building on Chagrin Blvd. 

Interior: Could be a little nicer.  They just painted recently

Vibe/Ambiance: It's a great place for dates and families, as long as the kids arent too young. 

Staff: Wonderful.  Some have been there 20+ years. 

Clientele: Mostly middle aged business professionals.

Price:  Moderate-high

Must get items: Any sushi.

Why I love or hate it: Love it.  As I said, I have been going for over 20 years.  Always a good meal. 

Final thoughts:  Try it.  It's one of the few GOOD sushi places on the east side."}
{"text":"I would probably eat here if I was closer, but I won't be making the trip up from Akron to specifically go here.

I ordered the Chirashi (Edomac) dinner, which was supposed to have included both raw and cooked fish on a bed of sushi rice. I ended up receiving only raw fish (Korean Style). The tuna was the freshest tuna I have had. However, I thought the portion was very small for the price. There was only 10 pieces (including the egg tamagoyaki), which is less than what I receive at a local sushi joint (Sakura) for their lunch portion with comparable quality seafood and at a third of the price. I also found the sushi rice to be underseasoned; it could have used more rice vinegar. 

Atmosphere was nice.  Manager was very inviting and the waitresses were dressed in kimonos.  Waitresses were prompt with clearing dishes and refilling water.

The restaurant is located in the basement of an office building."}
{"text":"I was visiting my bf in the Cleveland area, and we were really looking for a funky sushi place, after making reservations at Sushi Rock, we went on yelp and read reviews, quickly realizing our mistake, we decided to give Shuhei a try.  I couldn't be happier, while it wasn't the chic, modern place we originally looked for, the service was amazing, the ambiance was fantastic, and the food was insanely good.  

We both got Futomaki rolls, a larger variety of roll, he got the Rainbow, and I got the Scorpian, the food came out fast, and was super fresh and well made.  After my one roll I was stuffed, but he was so thrilled with the sushi that he ordered a second roll.

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"With the plethora of sushi restaurants opening in the area, Shuhei's dominance has diminished greatly. I used to lunch here quite often and would always leave with a fishy taste in my mouth after eating the sushi.  Additionally, it is an older restaurant and the age shows when you go there.  The furniture and walls definitely have battle scars and just seem a little dated.  

I would check out Wasabi or Pacific East before stopping in a Shuhei.  They are all in the same neighborhood, so why not?"}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi on the east side, Shuhei has been a staple in Beachwood, and Hiroshi an active supporter of the community for over 20 years."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi in the Cleveland area. Fresh and well prepared. I reccomned the yellowtail nigri. Desserts were great - mochi was excellent. A little exotic but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Stop Going!  Quality and Quantity have changed. 

Ordered take out tonight and have never been so disappointed with the portion size of three orders of sashimi costing $25. The quality was well below what I was accustomed to having been to Shuhei six times over the couple years. Saba, Salmon and 4 the worst tasting slices of Hamachi I have ever had. 

These pieces were no larger than a quarter!

When I called from home I spoke with the manager Rick. I informed him of the situation and asked if there was anything he would be willing to do. He offered that I could bring it back to the restaurant and they would redo it. But he told me that the owner gets mad if they cut the fish any larger. He also stood by the quality of the fish. 

Previouly the quality had been pretty good. Now it's no better than the grocery store. 

See the picture. Have you ever seen worse hamachi?  The ramakin is small but is the largest thing in the picture. 

Avoid moving forward. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Moving to Cleveland, I was almost certain I'd have to give up good sushi. Coming from the east coast, almost all sushi was good...it was just a matter of finding the best. In Cleveland, i found most sushi was mediocre...until we discovered Shuhei.

This is, hands down, the best sashimi I have ever had. I can't speak to the sushi rolls that other reviewers comment on. I'm all about enjoying the actual fish...I find it to be wasteful to mask the flavors of something so delicious with rice and sauces. The pieces of sashimi are pretty big and very fresh. I ordered the sashimi dinner which came with a wide-sampling of their offerings. Every single piece was fresh and flavorful.

My boyfriend ordered one of their hot pots and it was big enough to feed probably three people. He also raved about his dinner.
The prices are typical of such restaurants so don't expect to get any bargains. However, you will definitely get what you pay for in the amazing quality!"}
{"text":"Tucked behind an office building along Chagrin Blvd, Shuhei has an understated presence, especially compared to the nearby Benihana.  That understatement turns into muted elegance as you enter the restaurant.  Sleek, modern furnishings and Japanese artwork offer visual tranquility, while kimono-clad servers lend a note of authenticity.  Each guest is offered an oshibori (hot towel) upon being seated, in keeping with Japanese custom.  

The menu at Shuhei offers a respectable variety of grilled meats, in addition to poultry and seafood dishes. Tempura, plus udon and soba noodles are available too.  Sushi is offered in maki, nigiri and the large futomaki rolls.  A personal favorite is the \"Tokyo Breeze\", crab stick and tuna wrapped in mango and avocado...a lightly sweet, fresh and colorful blend of textures. The a la carte sashimi menu is an eclectic mix of seafood with several interesting marinated and smoked selections, featuring the \"Tiger Eye\" (sake-soaked squid...not for the faint of heart).  Innovative combinations and fresh ingredients make for a consistently memorable dining experience.  Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I like it more and more.
This past weekend went for an early lunch with my son. We sat at the sushi bar so that he can get an experience of well-made sushi.
Ordered simple hand rolls.
Fish was extremely fresh,
Rice was warm and perfect and the seaweed was crispy.
Exceptional quality. Quick service. Delicious sushi. I am looking forward to my next time. I think this place is comparable to Ginko in quality with less pretense and no need for reservations or a long wait."}
{"text":"I like to test places I'm new to with the same rolls to build a base comparison - spicy salmon roll, nigiri sake (salmon) and a Philly roll. Basic. And while the spicy here was hot, the tight little rolls did not impress. Yes they are basic, but doing those well leads to eating more complex rolls. I wasn't blown away with the sushi but service was fast at the bar. No lunch combo prices either - best go down to Pac East or Wasabi for a deal on slightly better rolls with a salad too. $21 for 3 selections is steep at lunch time."}
{"text":"Great food here...sushi is good with a nice mix of traditional sushi and your \"new age\" type with mayo and or hot stuff. Japanese noodles are well prepared, though the broth is a bit sweet for my taste. Sashimi selection somewhat limited but whatever is offered is always fresh and high quality. The raw salmon is prepped perfectly for sashimi serving and the maguro, hamcachi and hirame are always good. The tempura was perfect, light and crispy batter, not hard or tough. Really liked the grilled salmon dinner and especially the ribeye steak, WOW. One friend enjoyed an Entrée Salad, had scllops and vegetables stir fried and served on top of a sald, good value.  Loved the frog legs but sort of different for a Japanese place. Wines by the glass choices are ok and the sake selection seemed limited, thought there would be more of those."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.

Well, I'm not sure whether to cross Shuhei off of my Japanese run restaurant list.  The servers and two sushi chefs that I met on my two visits were not Japanese... but the owner, Hiroshi, is.  At least one of the hostesses is also Japanese.  Compared to Sushi Rock and Pacific East, this is a much more traditional joint.

On both occasions, we went for Moriawase nigiri combinations, with some Morimoto beers.  The second visit, I tried the Ramen (no options, only ramen), a seared Yellowtail platter, Agedashi tofu, oshinko, squid, tataki and ... something else that eludes me.

All preparations were \"more\" japanese, but the Ramen included peppers and a number of flavour elements that were more suggestive of the continent, or south east asia.  Agedashi tofu used a dilute Ponzu sauce, without the usual garnishes.  Still, the crisp skin was reasonably managed.

Sushi quality wasn't too bad...  Better than Pacific East, and a little worse than Sushi Rock in terms of freshness.  I did not inquire as to their ship dates, so I don't know whether the Sushi represented the fresh end or old end of their stock. 

The rice bed was a tad soggy for my taste, but held together well.  Not a lot tartness.  

Wasabi was from the tube, I think... given the consistency.

Decor is a bit low key, reminiscent of the slew of Japanese restaurants built in the late 80's.  

Will I be back?  Probably.  But I still haven't found that one nihonshoku-ya that will be getting my regular patronage."}
{"text":"I've probably eaten at Shuhei 10 times in the past year, and I think it's a great place! I never experienced bad service, and I never had a bad meal. They have a selection of really authentic dishes, as well as entrees for non-sushi lovers. This place served sushi before anyone else in Cleveland did, and I love that the waitresses wear Japanese clothing!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi bars in Cleveland. Authentic Japanese cuisine. The atmosphere is peaceful for such a large dining area. Children friendly. Would recommend to anyone looking for an authentic Japanese cuisine restaurant."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Cleveland. The seaweed salad is to die for! I love the negamaki too!"}
{"text":"I'm a NYer and pretty picky- this place was terrific, interesting specials and solid sushi. Service was terrific and pretty friendly. A bit weird trying to figure out where the restaurant actually is, but once you know to drive around back- your good! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"For starters i didnt come here for sushi i came here for friends and to socialize. I didnt order any sushi but i did order the spicy calamari and the gyoza. The gyoza was so juice and tender with every bite gently oozing juices of flavor. It was paired with some pretty unique dipping sauce that was a bit spicy all while being delicious. 

Im seperasting this section because it deserves a spot of its own. The Fried Calamari... CALAMARI CALAMARI CALAMARI. Im gonna be up front here i tried the sushi here and wasnt impressed at all. Its mediocre in terms of sushi quality. On top of that it was some of the most expensive sushi i have ever had, but let me tell you about the calamari!!! CALAMARI!!! It was hands down the best fried calamari i have had in yearz. The breading was perfect the sauce was perfect. The texture???? PERFECT!. The sauce tasted similar to the sauce you would get on Korean Fried Chicken which is something im obsessive over. I even stop dipping my gyoza in Its sauce and used the calamari sauce. 

If i ever end up here at this location again it will be to devour their squid and the sauce that comes with it."}
{"text":"This is only my second lunch here. But both have been very enjoyable. 

This is not your normal commercial sushi place. Great people putting together quality ingredients in classic ways make this place unique. 

Trust me the is no sushi place better in Cleveland. I bit hidden but once you find it you won't forget it."}
{"text":"I eat sushi often and in Europe, North America and Japan.  The food here is among the best.  The pieces were fresh and well prepared.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is one of the first times I have left an Asian restaurant feeling genuinely full!
I ordered the Vegetarian Hand-Rolled Heaven and it lived up to its name!  Each portion of my meal was fresh, full of flavor and beautifully presented.  Our server was efficient and friendly.    It is a bit pricey, but worth it in my opinion!"}
{"text":"The cooked sushi appetizers were pretty good, but the rest of the sushi not so good, some of the servers did not understand what I was talking about. The hot pot YAY, I do not like the mayo on dishes though definitely too Americanized, and the sushi is expensive for what is given, we only be back during winter for hot pot, but only a few times maybe, hot pot at home is better get food from chinese market and sauces much cheaper anyhow."}
{"text":"This is a great Japanese restaurant, if you can find it. There is a small sign (easy to miss - for me at least!) on the highway in front of an office building. To get to the restaurant drive around back and enter the basement!

But that's the hard part. Once you've entered the place, the ambiance is quite nice. The service was also excellent, although our waitress was clearly Chinese.

Oh, and the food? It was great. We went for lunch on a Friday and the bento meal and nabe yaki udon were both good.

If you feel you can locate this place (we finally did, and many others did as well) give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wife and I made a reservation here because of the positive reviews on the food, despite what we had read about the service. Waited 25 minutes at our table and all we were served was water and a hot towel. Weren't even asked for a drink order. As we left, the hostess thanked us. For what? Don't know."}
{"text":"Came here at the end of the lunch hour (approx 30 min left) and felt rushed to order as if they wanted me out of there and were doing me a favor feeding me. Except there were other people still eating. That's why they get knocked off a star. Otherwise, avocado with salmon sashimi was great and house salad was good too."}
{"text":"Construction going on when I went for lunch.  Waitstaff was super disorganized. No lunch specials.  Sushi tasted fishy to me.   Not at all impressed and must likely won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in all the world. I travel 25 miles to eat there. They push two tables together for my friend and I because we order nothing but appetizers and sushi. The smoked salmon aemono with avocado and spicy mayo is delicious. The crab salad maki is a complete foodgasm. The negimaki is tender and comes with a rich sauce. The tempura shrimp is huge and juicy. I have never had anything at this place that was not utterly delicious. It's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!!! Awesome sushi bar, great Japanese beers, sake galore and super fresh fish. Who would have known Cleveland would have great sushi? I didn't and now know where to tell people to go. It's hidden and I came during a snow storm, thankfully!  I was able to sit at the bar and enjoyed a sashimi platter-chef choice. It was amazing. Fresh and delicious! Great soup and the ginger dressing on the salad setup the fish perfectly. Come here if you're in Cleveland. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Excellent quality sushi and usually good wait staff. The fish is always fresh and well prepared.  The saki  menu is good ( according to my father) and the appetizers, salads and soups are above average.  The beer selection is not great. The bill is pricey but you get what you pay for!  Overall, strongly endorse this place if you have some cash and want great sushi on the east side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Shuhei a few times in the last year both with family and business colleagues.  The sushi and sashimi are very, very good.  I travel a lot, eat a lot of Sushi, and Shuhei's food compares with the best.  Everyone I have dined with has been very impressed. 

The atmosphere is middling and it gets crowded/noisy on the weekends. Correspondingly, the service declines on the weekend as well. 

If your focus is the food, you will love Shuhei!"}
{"text":"There are much better choices for Sushi in Cleveland.  Very pricey here.  Inconsistent quality.  Unreliable hours.  Try Pacific East instead."}
{"text":"I love this place. My prior review was 5 star, but this week it was so disappointing. I asked for tea, by the time we were done with our appetizer it hadn't come. I asked again. The gyoza was greasy and the dough wasnt the same, I couldn't pick the dumpling up without it crumbling.
My dragon roll was good. But then before my companion had finished eating the waitress brought the bill. What??? Trying to rush us out at lunch?  It wasn't busy at all. 
Just disappointing service, and not the good quality I'm used to here."}
{"text":"For rolls, Japanese East was much better in Eton village. They were also more pricer. I can't understand all the rave reviews."}
{"text":"This and Pacific East in Coventry are the best sushi restaurants in Cleveland.  The quality is the same at both, but Shuhei is more upscale, and more formal. They don't like kids. Shuhei is more expensive than Pacific East. Bottom line: the sushi is good."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now, both times for dinner. First time was better than the second.

I have two main issues with Shuhei, namely: (1) price-for-value; and (2) service standards.  This place is extraordinarily expensive for the quality of food and the ambience of the restaurant. We spent about $40 per head here, and the food is a B- at best (usually C+). There isn't much ambience to speak of, as the restaurant is located in the basement of a Beachwood office building. 

Another issue, again with respect to value, is that their alcohol selection is pitiful and exorbitantly-priced.  I am not one to complain about paying \"restaurant prices\" for alcohol, but expect a varied selection of beer and wine. Shuhei does not have any such selection, and was an utter disappointment in this regard.

Service is also hit-or-miss, and averages at about a B-.  It is hard to get a server's attention, and on one occasion we were seated near their kitchen. It was loud and passing servers/busboys kept knocking into my chair and not one offered an \"excuse me.\"

NOT RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"I picked Shuhei for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago, and we had a really great meal here!  I was choosing my own birthday celebration spot and spent quite a while debating options,  and Shuhei fit my requirement of having sushi with decent ratings and my preference for places that aren't outlandishly expensive or a pain to get to from my house (sorry Tremont and downtown, wasn't feeling the drive/parking situation).  If you find yourself in a similar situation in the east suburbs, you'll be happy if you make the same choice!

It's a little loud because it's quite busy, even on a Sunday evening, but the ambiance is nice with servers in kimonos, pretty art on the walls.  We opted for sushi combos and really enjoyed just about everything in them!  The fish tasted fresh, and the rice was just the right texture.  The sushi omakase was just the right size for me; my husband had the deluxe combo and had some leftovers I happily stole for lunch the next day.  That one might be good to split between two people if you add an appetizer.  Their salad wasn't my favorite, but the miso soup that came with was great. I liked that they had \"small rolls\" for the more traditional options-- there's a better fish to rice and nori that way-- but they also had some interesting-looking fancy rolls I'd love to try in the future.  I'd also love to try the hand rolls, the chirashi, the sukiyaki and some of the other cooked options.  I guess that means I'll be back, hopefully sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Came here with a group 4 after searching for a place that would be open on Christmas night.  Apparently many other people had the same idea, because it was packed!  We got there around 7:45 and were told it'd be a 20 minute wait, but it was actually only about 10 minutes.  

The overall atmosphere is very nice.  They brought us complimentary tea right away, and all the waitresses wear kimonos.  Maybe it's cheesy, but I'm a sucker for kimonos.  They're so pretty!

Menu is quite large, but I wasn't super hungry so I just a vegetable futomaki and miso soup.  It was your pretty typical veggie sushi - I get that it's hard to make vegetarian sushi really stand out (though it is possible!).  Someone at my table got the Handroll Heaven and it was gorgeous! 

Shuhei is a nice place, my only complain would be that it's a little expensive.  I think Pacific East still holds the place of my favorite sushi spot in Cleveland, but I'd definitely return to Shuhei!"}
{"text":"This goes for any sushi joint in the Midwest during the cold season -- the sashimi won't be as fresh. I tend to look for brighter color, a more translucent appearance, and a gelatinous rather than soggy texture. It wasn't the case.

Unagi Don (Eel on rice) is usually one of my favorite dishes -- but the one I had a freezer-burn aftertaste. Ew. I didn't finish it, again, not fresh. I should've gone for the hand rolls drowned in sauce or the deep fried stuff. I've had better from this establishment, they just didn't have it that night."}
{"text":"Went back with family in town. 
Skipped the sushi and tried things on the dinner menu. 

Teriyaki Salmon - average.  I'll cut them some slack because they didn't use teriyaki sauce from a bottle, but their teriyaki sauce was not authentic.  Teriyaki sauce is so easy to make (equal parts sugar, soy and a little rice wine vinegar) Theirs tasted more like soy sauce and oil only. Not sweet, very salty.   They did, however, serve a large nice fillet of salmon. 

Udon - okay. No complaints. 

Tonkatsu - okay, but its hard to ruin fried breaded pork. 


Maybe next time I'll try the miso salmon instead of the teriyaki or just stick to the sushi."}
{"text":"The classic Japanese dishes come out hot with fresh ingredients. The ambiance is cute and period; all of the waitresses wear a kimono. It is an mid upper scale resturant behind a commercial space, which is a bit strange. The sushi is good but the portions are small for the price. The trend continues for the entrees; great food for a high price($15-30 per entree)."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Hubris since moving to Cleveland from Japan five years ago. We had nabe and sushi aji.  The sushi even at 9pm was perfect. This  place makes Sushi Rock taste like dog food. Definitely the place for authentic Japanese food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I selected this restaurant based in the stellar reviews, and could not have been more disappointed.  The sushi chef was fairly rude to us (we sat at the sushi bar), when we asked for Toro (which is listed on the printed menu) we were rudely told 'No Toro', and when we decided to settle on rolls we received tasteless blobs that were far too large to easily eat.  The fish is far from fresh and the sauces were anything but exceptional."}
{"text":"Oh. Geez. My. Knees.

I can't even remember how I stumbled upon this gem. But it's divine. Normally, I'm a big ol' sucker for a cute interior - but I could ignore that and write a five star review based off of how freakin' awesome their food is. 

That menu is so extensive. It offers dishes that NO OTHER sushi restaurant in Cleveland even comes close to providing. Even non-fish eaters are going to find memorable dishes that leave them salivating for more.

My favorite things?

The fact that you don't just have one seaweed salad to choose from - they have 3 or 4 different types that aren't typically offered elsewhere. 

The squid dishes have always had a good meaty texture. Never rubbery. Well seasoned and sauced. 

The sushi is ALWAYS fresh and top-grade. 

They offer a bento box all day long! (Not just for lunch like most places do).

The waitresses are dressed in kimono's. It's adorable. (They probably can't stand it since it's a uniform, but gosh...) As a girl that likes to dress up, I think it's just fabulous; it definitely adds to the entire experience."}
{"text":"The best sushi in the area from a mostly-traditional restaurant.

Pluses:
-Excellent sushi
-Open sushi bar that is entertaining to watch
-Traditionally dressed waiters who are friendly
-The most perfectly cooked steamed vegetables
-Traditional on-floor seating available
-Items on the menu to try:
  -Gyoza is an excellent appetizer
  -Sushi is the focus and pride of the restaurant, and rightfully so
  -The bento box provides the opportunity for a first-time visitor to try all of the delicacies the restaurant offers, including a healthy portion of nigiri and roll sushi plus some excellent tempura
  -The tempura is well-cooked and not overly greasy. This is a great option for diners not interested in sushi or seafood.

Negatives:
-Slightly crowded
-What began as some beautiful pieces of art has turned into much tchotchke
-Waiters are often brief in their explanations of dishes"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in an odd building. When you walk in, the atmosphere is very strange. They have waitresses dressed in kimonos but the room decor and setup is like a Chinese American buffet. It was really a big turn off, but I figured the food would justify the visit. I ordered a steamed mussel appetizer, one order of salmon sashimi (3 small slices for $7.75), one order of eel nigiri (2 pieces for $7), and a glass of cabernet ($8). Although the food was decent, it was ridiculously expensive and definitely not worth the price. For $36 without tip, I got a bowl of bland mussels steamed in miso-type water (I am hesitant to call this soup), 5 regularly sized pieces of sushi, and a glass of wine. I left hungry and feeling robbed. I ended up going to the Giant Eagle across the street and picked up a snack. Why is this place getting such high ratings? There must not be much competition in the area or something. Service was nice and friendly though."}
{"text":"We love it every time we have dinner there! The sushi is the best in the city! The drinks there really busy too! The service is so great"}
{"text":"The place was packed, could not get reservations earlier than 8:00. I got the Eel dinner. It had so many bones, it was impossible for me to eat it. But the miso soup was really good. The Japanese \"coleslaw\" was good too."}
{"text":"Have actually been here quite a few times over the years, but not for a while.  The good news is that Shuhei hasn't changed much...it still quality food and service.  Shuhei does not have the flash of Sushi Rock, but it has better food.  We have done sushi more at Pacific East in Coventry as of late, but Shuhei reminded me why we were big fans for many years.  Will be back soon.

Definitely recommend the fried wasabi shumei.  They were fantastic.  The sushi rolls (spider, scorpion) were also much better than I remembered."}
{"text":"I rate 4 stars because I compare Shuhei to all Japanese resturants I had before when I lived in New York and Seattle. For Cleveland area, I'd love to give 5 stars for its excellent service and various of foods.

I would say it is the best Japanese resturant around this area. Plenty of choices on the menu. Sashimi is pretty decent and fresh. Panko Chicken(????is a bit dry but taste good. My friend had Tofu Udon, and she likes it.

The service and the resturant's decoration is definately give a bonus. Waitresses wear Kimono, which makes me cant help but speaking Japanese to them when I order my food. Really good envrionment."}
{"text":"The poke bowl with the red sauce was AMAZING!! The sushi was also great, and the miso soup was flavorful. It's a bit pricey, but I definitely will be returning, especially for the red sauce laden poke bowl! 

My friend just returned from studying abroad in Japan and I will definitely bring her here!"}
{"text":"Shuhei will alway hold a special place in my heart. I worked here in my early 20s and they gave me so much.  i learned great food can not be compromised, quality and consistency are supreme, and how to appreciate culturally diverse gastromomics.  Without   Shuhei i would have never lived in Mexico nor beem married or divorced. Hiroshi and Sonya were like parents at times calling me put on my bullshit and rewarding for a job well done. 

So when ever i come back it is super emotional.  I can not just take anyone there. It is usually with family, a best friend, and or a significant other. I even proposed here.
The food quality is just as amazing as it was when I was a server there more than 20 uears ago. Its cool many of the same people that worked here when i did are still there. That says a lot about quality, consistancy   and overall amazing ownership.  There are so many amazing things in the menu I can not even begin. My favoritei item is what  recommended to the Israeli consulate 20 years ago, literaly out of 20 people 17 took my recommendation, knowing the jews do not eat shellfish, and i even said: well its not kosher but the scampi black bean is amazing.  It is truly a transcendental dish that i loved 20 years ago and i still have not found one that is comparable. This is one amazing restaurant, that has been here for a long time and will be here for a long time.
These folks make everything from scratch,  like the newest trends, have been doing thos for over 20 years."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices. Good enough sushi. Interesting location. I was told this is the best sushi in the vicinity.  K.

The service was great and everyone was really nice. Not crowded at all"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place given all the positive reviews, but this place is extremely overrated. Not only did my boyfriend and I wait over an hour for our sushi (4 rolls), but when we (politely) asked the owner about the wait he was very rude. And the sushi was not good, either. Disappointing, won't be coming back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Good quality, traditional style Japanese food. I've eaten here a number of times and I always go home feeling satisfied. It is, in my opinion, on of the best places in Ohio to get sushi and traditional Japanese food. A lot better than almost any other place I've been with only one exception.  I highly recommend this place if you want a taste of traditional Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start this review by saying that I have been going to Shuhei on Chagrin Falls Blvd in Beachwood for almost 20 years, I think it is one of the best Sushi houses in all of Cleveland....I like that it is dark and tucked away on the bottom floor of a office building and love eating at the Sushi Bar as the Chefs prepare your rolls.....Started this visit with a Sapporo (basically Japanese beer in a big bottle!!), light and satisfying during the meal...We ordered the Spider Maki roll (which is Soft Shell Crab, Rice and Seaweed) and the Shrimp Tempura (Shrimp deep fried Tempura), both rolls were 8 pieces and I would recommend both, however for some reason the presentation was a bit lacking during this visit and I thought the rice was a bit dry...definitely not what I'm use to when I visit....We also ordered Tobiko (Salmon Eggs) with a large quail egg on top.....The Tobiko was delicious and I always order it when I visit Shuhei.....highly recommend (although the price $11 for 2 pieces is the same as an 8 piece specialty roll)...We finished our meal with 2 bowls of Miso Soup which were also good and I would  recommend as well...I will say that I was a bit disappointed with the service, the dry rolls, the presentation and the overall experience..I know I gave it 4 stars, but today's visit was a 3 star visit at best...I will give you the benefit of the doubt and hope it was a bad night, Saturday night before Xmas - but if I have another experience which is mediocre probably will look for another sushi spot in Cleveland..."}
{"text":"Food was so-so and very pricy. On top of that, we saw the owner several times walking about the restaurant and asked to meet him. After spending almost $90 on food, our waitress informed us he would not be coming to our table. If you're a big fan of good customer service, avoid this place. The waitress complained to us about a nearby table that wanted separate checks and how that was so ridiculous. It was odd and pretty unprofessional. Such a disappointing experience!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in NEO, hands down. Fresh fish, not overwhelmingly drowned in sauce/mayo. Service is amazing too. I love the pre-meal hot towel."}
{"text":"Ok, I get it.  

Here's why Shuhei is awesome, but only if you dine in.

1) The food and the service is a visceral experience.  Everything is above average here.  Everything, even the salad dressing.

2) It's hidden under and behind an office building, completely unassuming.  Therefore, anyone coming here (you, cool person) is in the KNOW.

3) There are actual kimono-wearing, Japanese servers who speak both  Japanese and excellent, poetic English.  They are very professional and pleasant.

4) Hot, moist, white cotton hand cloths (Oshibori).  Brought to the table rolled and stacked and infused with the smell of cleanliness.  (for your hands!)

5) You will feel under-dressed unless you came in at least business casual attire.  Whatever you have on is also fine.  No judgement here.

6) Great sushi chefs who respect their art, and work with diligence on every dish.

7) Great sushi bar to see the masters work and see their great selection of sake.  House sake, room temp always.

I know the California roll is usually a joke, but theirs was really the best I've ever had.  Same with the miso soup.  

If you can't decide, just get the Hand Roll Heaven or splurge for the Bento Box and you'll get whatever the chef knows is currently in it's prime."}
{"text":"They were very friendly and helpful.  Great service.  Great food.  We will definitely come back!

It would be nice if they offered free wifi."}
{"text":"Ordered a need appetizer and a tuna tataki with a small Kirin beer. The place was jam packed and seems very busy.I might try the white tuna Poke next time. I did not know what the dish was so I asked the very cute lady working the cashier and she told me."}
{"text":"Shuhei's is tucked away in the back of an office building and may be a bit hard to find. This used to be my favorite Japanese restaurant, but I believe that the quality has declined a bit over the past few years. 

The service at Shuhei is not bad, but also not great. Don't expect your water to be filled frequently or your server to come by and check on you that often.

On my most recent visit, my parents and I shared a fried calamari appetizer. I love that they fry big pieces of the leg to give you a meaty bite. The batter itself is unique, and is similar to the batter of the chicken katsu (rather than typical calamari or tempura batter) and isn't overly greasy. But what really makes this appetizer is the dipping sauce. It's got a slightly sweet, slight spicy kick that cuts right into the heavy fried taste of the calamari. Other favorites that I would recommend are the fried oysters and the gyoza.

As an entree, the three of us shared a bento box, as well as a sushi roll special. I really don't know how one person can eat an entire bento box alone, because the three of us couldn't even finish it. It came with a miso soup, salad, assorted sushi, sashimi, nigiri, negi maki, salmon, udon, and rice! I would say that everything was average to pretty good, except for the udon, which tasted distinctly like tap water.

In general, most of the entrees I have gotten here, from sushi rolls, to nigiri, to fried options, have been pretty good, although I would probably stay away from the soups.

Shuhei is a good option if you are in the area and looking for a solid Japanese meal!"}
{"text":"This elegant little Japanese restaurant as fresh and delicious food. The pieces of fish are good sized. We had lunch and we were in a rush and they took great care of us and got us out the door quickly.  the bento box has a great value at $22 with a ton of food. I will definitely come back to this place next time I'm in Cleveland"}
{"text":"I'm just not impressed. I recently moved back to the East Side after living in San Diego for a few years and have been craving sushi. My hometown friends talked really highly of shuhei so I decided to try it. There was really nothing impressive about it, and I think the high rating is because it's a local spot, not actually high quality. People who say they've been going here for years and think it's great are reviewing out of ignorance of what good sushi and Japanese really is. Our table of 7 split many orders or rolls and sashimi and none of it stood out. The fish tasted like it was in the fridge for too long and any vegetables in the rolls tasted low quality. The best word I can describe the sushi as is stale. The salad tasted like a prepackaged lettuce mix. The calamari was the one saving grace of the dinner."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner tonight with my friend. Food was excellent. Waitress was very friendly. A little expensive but maybe we ordered too many sushi dishes. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"The food is a 5.  The atmosphere, less important, is a 3.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if we could do half stars.

As others have pointed out, it's tough to find, and yes, very little of the staff is actually Japanese.

But, we're going for the sushi, right?  And oh, what great sushi it is.

The sashimi is great.  I have yet to have a piece of sashimi at Shuhei that was less than a great representation of the fish.  Fresh, the right temperature, generous cuts, well-presented.

Shuhei's futomaki is really wonderful, and I have not found anything better anywhere in the country.  As good, yes... in Chicago and NY.  Better?  I really and truly don't think so.  The anniversary roll is, to me, their signature roll, and is overwhelming, but in a good way.  I am a big guy and I have a big mouth (ask my colleagues), so most rolls, even the futomaki, I can do in one bite per piece.  However, with the anniversary roll, I will only do this when I'm with people who will not judge me for the squirrel-cheeked display of gluttony that occurs.

I will say that I'm not a big sake fan, so I can't pass judgment there.  To me, the perfect match to a platter of sushi is a Sapporo or Kirin.

Unlike Sushi Rock, this is not a place where you go to be seen.  Nor is it a place where you go to consume as much rice and fish as possible for the money.  This is a place where you go to appreciate absolutely top quality fish, perfectly cooked and seasoned rice (the foundation of a great roll or nigiri), and expert craftsmanship and presentation.

On those counts, Shuhei is a winner.  There is no better sushi in Cleveland.  Pacific East is an honorable second place.  I feel dirty even having mentioned Sushi Rock in this review.  We are talking about the difference between Lopez and the microwave burritos from the freezer section at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Really bland sushi with very small pieces of fish.  I liked the appetizers but was so disappointed when the sushi came out.  It all tastes the same and just lacked flavor.  The hostess was fantastic and service is great but I wouldn't go back.  I feel like this is nursing home sushi."}
{"text":"Shuhei is the best sushi and most authentic in the area. Nestled hidden beneath a business building you would never expect such a fabulous meal. From eating in or taking out, their sushi is quality and fresh. I love their sashimi platter, and love to try new rolls and appetizers on their menu. Also amazing, is their bone in ribeye that surprisingly melts in your mouth. All the portions are great sizes and they never disappoint. The dining room does get busy on the weekends so I do recommend a reservation, or to call ahead. For their take out, they take the time to package all orders nicely."}
{"text":"Shuhei is an awesome restaurant! My coworkers and I stopped by for lunch and I'm so glad we did. When we arrived around 11:30 we were quickly seated by the friendly hostess and greeted by our waitress. Like any other restaurant I can never decide what to eat so I asked the waitress for suggestions. She recommended the sushi and sashimi bento box and my coworkers and I decided to give it a try. The fish was fresh and the fried rice was sooooo yummy. Shuhei is probably my new favorite beachwood restaurant. I'm looking forward to visiting again and trying a new menu item."}
{"text":"Great service, large selection, great food. What else could one ask for? Ok, so it's located in a weird office building ... well makes it easier to make reservations. We came with a baby who didn't nap well tonight and apologetically asked for a corner where we wouldn't bother other guests and they gave us a table where you sit on the floor so baby could essentially sit and crawl beside us. And they gave us a corner where others won't be as bothered if baby decided to voice his disapproval or practice his vocal cords. It certainly made our dining experience an easier one and the other guests didn't seem to notice us much since it was a louder restaurant overall. 

We got the seafood hot pot and couldn't believe that all that food was intended for one person! We shared. We also got an Alaskan hand roll which was yummy. The seaweed was flavorful and crunchy, the way it's supposed to be. We didn't have a wide sampling of raw fish besides for the hand roll app but we saw several other tables with sushi entrees which looked promising.
I'll definitely be back to try the sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi here is quite good and the fish is full of umami :) The soba is also decent. 
It is a little pricey but it's understandable since it's probably hard to get good quality fish in Cleveland. 
Overall, it's a nice place to grab pretty good sushi. The owners also seem very nice!"}
{"text":"A good sushi spot. Just as many places in Cleveland, the location is very odd in the basement of an old office building. For me, kinda kills the ambiance. Most importantly, the fish were fresh. I would consider a return visit."}
{"text":"IMHO, this is the best sushi restaurant in the Cleveland suburbs and the second best in Greater Cleveland, second only to Ginko in Tremont.  Great, fresh sushi and yesterday I had the yakisoba which was excellent.  Their ramen noodles are also very good.  They have a very good, interesting hot sauce as well that you have to ask for.  It's not sriracha or sambal.  I think it's house made.  The service is always good, they have a good sake list and they usually have the glbc seasonal beer in a bottle."}
{"text":"We got orders to take out. I didn't like that they put multiple rolls (including vegetarians) in one big plate, my friend who can't eat fish couldn't eat his vegetarian dinner because it was with some fish. I thought the sushi was just okay, maybe too much rice. 
People at the restaurant and whoever took my order over the phone were very efficient and nice. I would probably give it another chance but I'll go to the restaurant to see is it gets better"}
{"text":"This is the place in Cleveland to get excellent COOKED Japanese food.  It's very easy to miss, because it's tucked away in the back of an office building.  Really, to get here you drive down Chagrin past a lot of wide open space and quiet office buildings, and turn into what looks like yet another quiet office building with an empty parking lot in the front.  In the back, you'll find another parking lot, full of cars.  It's worth it once you find it.

The menu looks bit pricey at first, but their portion size is very large, providing for easy sharing (and therefore a cheaper meal).  One appetizer, one roll and one entree is way more than enough for two people (and I'm a pretty big eater myself).  I've tried their sukiyaki, their nabeyaki and their bento box - all three are full of flavor and very delicious.

Their raw sushi and sashimi... unfortunately does not taste fresh.  I had sashimi from this place a couple of times and each time the salmon and tuna tasted sort of... frozen.  Pacific East on Coventry has fresher fish. However, Shuhei's cooked sushi is quite good and prepared well.  In particular, I'm a big fan of their gomoku futomaki (eel, smoked salmon, cucumber, egg, mushroom!).

Their service is a bit slow, but that's because they are always packed with people.  I would definitely recommend coming here and trying out their sukiyaki!"}
{"text":"Amazing the fish is very fresh tastes like real Japanese you won't be disappointed if you've never eaten here you're missing out best place ever"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in the United States. I've been going there since it opened -- I grew up at Shuhei and I've been a very loyal customer for more than two decades. Every special occasion was enjoyed at Shuhei. They even catered my wedding. So, I can't say enough good things about the food and the service.

Unfortunately, I have to give it only three stars for something that is extremely upsetting to my family:

Over the past couple years I've noticed that the male host who greets us when we walk in (owner/manager) is always very irritated by the presence of children. Whether it's my own kids or my friends' kids, he acts very put out when we show up with them. 

We aren't parents who let our child run wild in a restaurant. We sit at our table, bring small activities to keep them busy, stay as quiet as any other table and clean up after ourselves. We're usually done eating and out the door in less than an hour. We tip at least 25% and usually closer to 30% simply to show them we appreciate their food and great service. Therefore, I don't understand why he should be irritated when we bring in our kids. No one else in the restaurant ever seems to mind our presence -- this includes customers, the female hostess (owner?) and waitresses. But, it always seems like we've done something to upset him from the moment he sees our children are with us and it's uncomfortable and frustrating. When we go without our children it's a different experience.

I understand if someone's children are causing a scene -- making a mess, making too much noise, being unruly, etc... But that's not our family. Perhaps, he's had a bad experience with other people and their children, and I certainly empathize with that. But, so long as our kids are behaving themselves, then we just ask that we receive the same treatment as customers without kids.

Anyway, it breaks my heart to mention it because I truly LOVE Shuhei, but it's been going on for more than a year and we don't want to stop going to a place we love simply because we have kids. And as I said, the food and the service in general are phenomenal."}
{"text":"A decent Japanese restaurant. I was here for lunch and I had the sashimi/sushi lunch box. It's about 20 dollar, kind of pricy but the fishes were very fresh.  Service were good."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch on Fri 11/17 with a party of 7.  Arrived prior to noon and was seated immediately.  Broad menu was good for kids and adults - sushi/sashimi, appetizers, bento box, salads, etc.  you can order a lunch special or from the full menu.  Got out for under $90 with tax & tip included (no alcoholic drinks but the green tea kept flowing).  Quality food, good service, available parking, and moderate pricing.  Enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to say this place was sheer disappointment after it was so highly spoken of to me. When I think of my beloved Japanese food and sushi, I think of fresh ingredients, clean taste palate, and beautiful presentation. It's hard to mess up presentation, so I will give them that. However the other two factors.... swing and a miss. The calamari roll was chewy and the squid batter made up half of the portion. Seriously, it was a side of calamari with all the breading. Then there was the jalapeno roll. That roll is essentially why I give this place two stars. A jalapeno roll is my absolute favorite. I love the crunch of raw jalapeno and the slight spice it gives to fish. So simplistic and perfect!! Shuhei though, they used pickled jalapenos. Like the ones they put on nachos at a sports bar. There is a time and place to used pickled jalapenos, and it is not in my sushi roll. 

Plus, there was the usual slow service that everyone else pointed out. I thought maybe they have increased their tempo over the months/years, but the answer is no. No they have not. Still expect slow service when you go here!"}
{"text":"I truly liked Shuhei. So happy that I had someone tell me about this place. I loved the food here! The sashimi was good and our tuna rolls were fantastic.  I was a little nervous eating sushi in Cleveland but Shuhei has won me over."}
{"text":"I was hoping the first time here was a one off as we have been told this is the place to go for sushi....Came here again the other night and was let down again. And by that i mean people locally build this place up sooooo much and its average. The special rolls have a lot of hot sauce or spice added to them, and while not bad wasn't really impressed... They have a lot of food on the menu, which is typical Sushi restaurants and i will have to try the ramen if i make it back here again. But with the quality of sushi i have found at other places in the area, im not sure i will rush back here."}
{"text":"Great sushi, average noodles, awesome ambiance, and a very pleasant and accommodating waitstaff. 

I ordered the Firecracker roll, which is a roll with salmon, roe, avocado, and jalapeno peppers.  The quality of the fish was great.  And, they also did an excellent job with the rice - moist and the right texture.  The fish roe were plump and popped in your mouth and the jalapeno peppers added a nice kick to the roll.

The beef yakisoba was decent.  There were a lot of vegetables and not too much meat.  I also ordered a side salad. The waitress brought three different choices of dressings - a sesame dressing, a creamy garlic dressing, and an orange ginger dressing.  My favorite was the orange ginger dressing, although the creamy garlic dressing was good too.  The sesame dressing was a little salty for my taste.

The dining area is really nice.  It feels really cozy and the waitstaff is sociable and attentive.  Tip for getting to the restaurant - if you're turning in from Chagrin, the restaurant is in the back of the building."}
{"text":"Very pleasant atmosphere and array of menu options. Got a sashimi salad $17 and buri kama $13. The \"salad\" was just shredded radish with small cuts of three types of sashimi. Incredibly laughable for the cost. The kama was acceptable, though i've had much better at Pacific East for less cost. Others at my table got rolls-they are fairly tiny. Several of us remained hungry at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I'm no sushi expert but this was by far the best sushi I've ever had. I ordered a Bento Box which included miso soup (or salad), tempura shrimp and veggies, a bowl of rice, a California roll, and one sushi each of tuna, shrimp, salmon, and yellowtail. The sushi was oh-so-fresh fresh, the tempura warm and crispy and the staff was extremely friendly in their lovely kimonos. My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for lunch ($20 for the bento box) but I would certainly return here if I wanted to treat myself to some amazing sushi!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and a third of the price of other places. It is hard to find however if you aren't looking for it."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and everything was prompt, professional and delicious. I'd say I'm on the verge of being a regular at this fine establishment. You cannot go wrong and you certainly get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Tucked away in an office building. Very unassuming but great little spot."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in Cleveland. I've tried them all - from the east side to the west and everything in between. 
Don't let the office building basement location fool you. The setting - clean and calming. The sushi bar itself is impeccable. The servings are generous and the quality is seriously the best in north east Ohio - right down to the rice and ginger. You will not be disappointed. 
I'm a sashimi ( tuna, yellow tail, octopus) guy and I can't think of anywhere that consistently serves quality raw selections like Shuhei. 
Best part - they know how to expedite a quick lunch. 
Don't pass this place up"}
{"text":"The sushi here is so good and doesn't have that weird taste that you get at some other restaurants. The service is very friendly and pretty quick. I also recommend the chicken terriyaki. It costs more than some sushi places but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I had the shrimp Raman, Philadelphia roll, and New Orleans sushi roll. Everything was perfect and the Raman was so flavorful. I will be coming back, possibly later this week."}
{"text":"Best sushi in area.  Not cheap, but you get what you pay for in ingredients and service.  Shuhei is top notch in both."}
{"text":"Coventry's Pacific East might give it a run for its money, but other than that, this is the best sushi (or the best I've had) in Cleveland. The sushi staff are very friendly and will recommend the freshest stuff to you. The wait-staff are responsive and friendly as well.

The restaurant is quaint, and often pretty crowded even though it's pretty well hidden. the decor is nice at the door but a little quirky inside-- there's a collection of foreign money on the wall behind the counter. Really, though, it's just cause the restaurant focuses on what's really important, which is great food.

The sushi is proportioned very well-- nigiri is nicely balanced without the giant pieces of fish you get at some places. It's hard to go wrong with the sushi-- I've had just about everything on their menu and never been disappointed. They don't overdo it with the sauce, and if it's still too much for you you can order it on the side. their miso soup is just like it should be, light and unassuming. Their cooked appetizers are great as well-- I recommend the negimaki!

Shuhei is a little pricey but well worth the money. A great place to try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Way, Way, overrated.  Miso soup was blah, salad was decent and both of our entrees were tasteless
and the chicken in my dish was still clucking.  A really disappointing experience.  Almost stopped on the way home for fast food to clear the palate.  Much better Japanese food at mall food courts."}
{"text":"All you can really ask for from a sushi restaurant is good sushi. This place has it. The prices are decent as well. My experience was definitely better than any chain sushi restaurant that tries to compensate the quality and authenticity of their food with showy ambience."}
{"text":"I'd say this is probably some of the best sushi I had in Cleveland. SUPER FRESH! It is pricey, but you can't expect to get great sushi for cheap here. Can't remember what exactly I had since it was a while ago, but I do remember digging the waitresses dressed in the Japanese kimono's - so cute! The menu is super long and a little too much, but all in all, I loved it."}
{"text":"I recently went to Shuhei for a small event and we utilized their party room.  It has been several years since my last visit to the restaurant.  I thought everything was very good.  We had about 8 dishes that came out one after another.  The grand finale was when they brought out about 8 platters of sushi and rolls for our two tables.  To me, the cuts of fish were generous in size and everything seemed fresh to me.  (Now understand I'm not a sushi expert).  Another dish that was great was a large kettle of a beef soup- like stew that is served with a small bowl of rice on the side.  It was quite tasty and per a co-worker who lived in Japan for several years was very authentic.

I can see going here again in the future."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant is Japanese; thus he can provide traditional genuine Japanese cuisine. This is a high-end restaurant but the price worth high-quality food. I highly recommend this place because of their authentic tasty Japanese food and gorgeous atmosphere inside restaurant. Their fish is always fresh too I love it!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Dinner was great so was the service. This is the real deal Japanese. Place is very clean and the service is great. You can't go wrong with this place yummy good. I cant wait to go back.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+++++"}
{"text":"I've only been here once. It was a slight disappointment. It seemed more like an authentic Japanese restaurant to me so I felt like I had to look up a majority of the menu items. I ordered the teriyaki chicken to avoid not knowing what was on my plate.
It was just okay. Maybe something to try again, but it's hard to want to go back when there is a Benihana across the street."}
{"text":"The service is second to none and the food is fresh. Not as expensive as other sushi places around Cleveland, so for me the restaurant is good value for a fine dinner out. Very detailed menu, nice Japanese beer and saki selection too. Hard to top this place for taste."}
{"text":"Locals recommended this place for good Japanese food.  Overall the quality of food wasn't that impressive.  The uni seemed too watery.  I do recommend the mackerel/fish cheek.  The rolled up steak had a very good marinade sauce and texture of the steak was solid.  The octopus or squid was mediocre and just topped with a kimchi-like sauce.  

For the price i definitely think there are other nearby Japanese restaurants that are better quality and cheaper."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I've been coming here since it opened and it's maintained it's quality and still has a good price point. I've lived in multiple major cities but still nothing compares to Shuhei. Highly recommend sashimi boat, rolls (spider, crab, scorpion), and shrimp tempura. Whenever I'm in the area, I always make it a point to stop by for a meal."}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi in Cleveland and possibly the best I have ever had. The hand roll heaven sushi dinner is unbelievably delicious!! Servers are always polite and sweet. It is a hidden gem and I take all my friends here."}
{"text":"Arguably the best sushi restaurant in Cleveland.  I didn't give it 5 stars though because there was a stretch where I was not very impressed with the food, and I've only gotten back there twice since then and don't feel thats enough of an experience to give it a full five stars.  But since those last two times they revamped their menu completely, it is much larger than it was especially on the sushi end.  They have more sushi rolls than you can imagine.  I love it however, it might be a little much since it just makes decided that much more difficult.  But I will say anyone who is a sushi fan needs to try the Anniversary Roll.  I have yet to find a better roll at any restaurant that incorporates so many different flavors perfectly.  I don't remember everything that is in it so I won't try to explain it exactly.  But I know it has Unagi (eel), three types of fish roe, and avocado.  There is more to it however.  What makes this place fun is all the servers where traditional japanese garb (Kimonos) and they even have some areas of the floor seating where you sit on cushions at a table inches from the ground.  A nice traditional twist to the experience.  It is difficult to locate though so be sure to google it."}
{"text":"I give 3 stars because the sushi rolls I had were pretty good and the restaurant seemed nice and clean. Their website has a section for \"daily specials\" but it didn't list any specific specials. I called to ask and the person who could barely speak english told me that they had a 4.80 sushi daily special. I drove down and found that instead of the price $4.80 like I expected the NAME of the sushi roll she thought is special is called the four eighty. Between this and below average service annoyed me greatly."}
{"text":"Still my favorite sushi spot in Cleveland. The Futomaki is outstanding. I always start with a miso soup and house salad with the ginger dressing. Crab Salad Futomaki is reason I have been coming here for many years. The sushi is always fresh and consistent. I would recommend making a reservation on the weekends as it can get very busy."}
{"text":"Shuhei is hands down the best sushi in Cleveland. I get the crab futomaki roll and I love it! They also have amazing seaweed salad - so fresh!"}
{"text":"I know this is hard to believe, but Shuhei has the best sushi in all of America. It doesn't make sense, but it's the truth. I've had sushi all over the country (Florida, SF, chicago, all over East coast, etc) and I've never tasted Sushi that compares to Shuhei's. The best, plain and simple. Everthing else on the menu happens to be amazing also."}
{"text":"I haven't been there for quite a a while. It used to be my go-to place for sushi. So glad to see that it has maintained a great quality and super service. I need to make sure I visit this place more often."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I found this wonderful perfect little gem are your ago.we fell in love with it immediately!!! The Ramen is killer and the waitresses are so nice and helpful! Highly recommend this if you have a deep love for sushi and Japanese food in general"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in forever and forgot how good it was. Their sushi specialty rolls are so good. They have an excellent variety and large menu- even for those that don't like sushi. This place has been around forever and is always busy- that should say it all. Prices aren't bad and service is great. Will be coming here again soon."}
