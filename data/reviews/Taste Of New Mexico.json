{"text":"This food is amazing.
 The chef has had restaurants and has cooked with great people. That's why his tacos are Superb.  He has the most flaborable food infused with fresh New Mexico green 
Chilies. The green chili burger is  probably the best I have ever had.
I eat at Tipsy cactus when he is there. It is nice to pair it with equally outstanding craft beer"}
{"text":".for those that read my reviews you know Wednesday's my work always has a different food truck vendor come to feed us. I was really excited to see Taste of Mexico was there because I've heard great things, and have a new found love of New Mexican style food. Green chilies are amazing! After talking with the girl taking the orders I decided on a green chili pork taco and a beef and potato taco. The meal also came with chips and salsa. For a $1 more you could get a soda as well. I love, love, loved the green chili pork. So much flavor, spicy, and just so tasty. The beef and potato however I was not a fan of. It had no real flavor and the potatoes were small and reminded me of frozen breakfast potatoes. Their chips and salsa were great and the salsa was hot and perfect. I'd buy it if they bottled it for sure! I also wanted to add how fast and pleasant the service was. Great job!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I contacted Chef Gabe for having Taste of New Mexico out for our Sky Ancala community event, Food Truck Tuesday, and the chef surpassed all expectations! 
My party had one of each, and nobody had any complaints- and we had even less left over! Everyone's plates were cleaned! The chips and salsa accompaniments with the tacos and burritos STUFFED with meat and cheese truly made this truck's cuisine fantastic! 
Chef Gabe has 100% perfected the art of New Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"How does New Mexico taste, you ask?  Spicy!! is the answer.  In a good way.  This food truck came to my work and I was excited to try it!  The only offerings on the menu were red pork taco, red pork burrito, and frito pie.  I went with the red pork burrito.  It came out piping hot and served with thick chips and a medium-hot red salsa.  I'm pretty sure the only thing inside my burrito was red sauce and chunks of pork (not shredded pork like I was expecting!), but I could be wrong... either way, I enjoyed it and it was very filling.  I could not even finish the whole thing and it left my mouth slightly burning, so I liked it!

The side chips and salsa were also good, although I prefer the thinner chips and these were quite thick.  The good thing is they seemed to be made in-house fresh that day and not purchased from a store.

If this food truck came back, I would eat here again!  I would like to try their chili fries."}
