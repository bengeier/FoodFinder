{"text":"We stopped by Babes on a Friday night for a late dinner, and were happy to get a table with only a short wait. We waited near the bar, and the server was friendly and brought us our drinks quickly. 

Our food came quickly. Loved the fried portobello strips! My bf had the salmon and liked it, but thought the steamed veggies were really bland and not that fresh. My veggie burger was simple but tasty - they also toasted the inside of the bun which is something basic that I love and many places don't do. My fries arrived cold, but since our server was MIA, I just rolled with it. 

Our waitress is the reason for the reduction in stars. She was friendly and available until we had placed our orders, and then we only saw her again when the food came and 30 minutes after that when she brought our check. Even after that she kept walking past us as we tried to pay. 

I think we'll give them a second chance. The atmosphere was nice and it seems like a good place to bring the family. Hopefully we'll get a different waitress next time."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, Good food, good service, decent atmosphere, and decent deals. I went on a Thursday night to check out some of their slider burgers, not realizing it was the all-you-can-eat-pasta special night for $9, which sounds pretty good, but I was set on burgers. I headed to the bar to sit with my friends and watch some of the game and the staff were pretty helpful explaining the slider options and I even saw a guy at the bar go through at least 5 plates of pasta (must be a good deal). 

When we got our food, it was good, cute even, better than fast food, but nothing particularly special. The drinks on tap were fairly inexpensive and we had a few, and while it was nice to have quite a few screens in plain sight, there was nothing that really grabbed us to make us want to settle here for a more frequent gathering place. 

Not bad by any means, but nothing particularly special, and the parking lot (as well as location) are a little awkward, which definitely does not do them any favors. Do try out for their food as it is good and I hadn't been to a place named after Babe Ruth before, so that was novel too."}
{"text":"Loved the buffalo wings and Caesar salad!  Great place to watch the Badgers on game night- lots of large tables and big screens!"}
{"text":"Came here for trivia. I had the nachos, and they really weren't that good. Within 5 minutes the cheese made a hard, thick dome around the entire thing. It was not very satisfying after that.

Also the service wasn't great. The waitress would continually ask if we wanted more drinks, when we weren't even close to finishing the ones we had.

I guess it's alright for a sports bar. My expectations were low and it met my expectations."}
{"text":"Just finished a Friday Fish Fry at Babe's.  I always forget about this place, but it's great if you're a sports/Badger/Packer/Brewer fan.  Fish was great.  Their menu is diverse and the prices aren't crazy.  Bar service was especially nice.  Fish was well-prepared, lots of options besides fries.  Side salad served as an appetizer was more than just iceburg lettuce and it was fresh.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Babe's is a really comfortable neighborhood Bar & Grill.  They have a really good reuben sandwich and perhaps the best Black & Bleu burger in town.  There are televisions all over the place showing a variety of sporting events.  They also have a back room suitable for large groups.

If you go on Mondays, they have 1/2 price burgers!"}
{"text":"Indifferent service, bad food.  I had to send my lunch back, and it returned with the problem uncorrected.  

I won't return."}
{"text":"If there aren't any big games, Babes has live music some weekends and trivia on Tuesdays. These events are fun but Babes is best during big night games. It is one of the better places in Madison to watch the big game."}
{"text":"Tasty Cobb Salad

My wife and I visit Babes about once every 6 weeks for a Cobb salad.  Can't really speak for the rest of the menu; however, if you like Cobb salads (and you should, they're good for you), then you'll like Babes.  These salads are comparable to the Boston salad at Bostons Gourmet Pizza in Greenway Station in Middleton, better than the Cobb salad at TGI Fridays in Greenway, but not as good as Benvenuto's in Fitchburg.  Service, atmosphere, and price are all reasonable.  In the summer there's a nice place to sit outside although the view isn't much.

Alas, Bostons in Greenway Station went belly up in the summer of 2010."}
{"text":"Love myself some Babes! 
Very comfortable, ALWAYS great food and very reasonable.
The Nachos are the bomb and so are the drink specials."}
{"text":"I love Babes! My husband and I became regulars over the summer. We almost never miss the half off burger special on Mondays! They have a great selection of beer and good food. Some of the dinner entrees are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Babes famous nachos,should not be famous. The cheese was not melty at all and were like clumps of cheese that could not even stick on the chips or would come off easily. The only good thing about the nachos were that there was a lot of it, if you plan on ordering an entree make sure you get a half order and share it.

We had the mushroom burger, and the Cajun Alfredo pasta. Both came with a side dish; I got the soup, and she got the salad. The burger was cooked like I asked, and was good, nothing special or anything; a burger. The soup was good and hearty, it had cut up sausages in them and came with a few saltine crackers. The pasta was good, and the sauce was rich and came with a huge salad which could be a small entree in itself.
We also had an order of curly fries which were amazing. 

The service was alright, we waited kind of long before anyone greeted us and gave us a table, but there was a lot of cars in the parking lot so I assumed the outside seating was really busy, because the inside was kind of empty and we rarely saw our server, but surprisingly we didn't wait too long for our water to be filled when they were empty.

There is a parking lot outside the restaurant, but it's kinda dark. Babes is pretty good just avoid their \"famous nachos\", if you're expecting good nachos."}
{"text":"Food is ok and ok beer selection.  Staff is so-so....service is slow."}
{"text":"The menu has changed, but according to the waitress, some items (at least BLT salad) could still be ordered.

I ordered a muenster and mushroom burger, and it was fine. The cream of chicken with rice soup is now made with rice, no longer with wild rice.

Service at lunch seems to have gotten a bit faster."}
{"text":"We chose Babe's to host an anniversary party for our parents.  It was perfect!  Kathleen, the banquet manager, was incredibly helpful and flexible.  She even discouraged us from ordering too much food, which saved us a bunch of money (and we had the perfect amount of food).  Food was great, beer selection was great, and everyone had a great time.  I'd highly recommend Babe's as a private party venue!"}
{"text":"New in town and needed a place to watch the NFL playoffs and came here quite by accident. Passed it while running errands, ran in and checked out the menu and thought it looked pretty good. Perfect place for a foodie to go to watch some football! Nice beer selection and a I absolutely loved the Baked Buffalo Chicken Roll appetizer. It may be my new favorite--great combination of flavors with the buffalo chicken, crispy cabbage and tasty blue cheese. They give you four, which is plenty for a group and means taking some home if you're on your own. Went back a week later for the NFC and AFC Championship games with a buddy visiting from Chicago and he enjoyed it as well.  On that visit, tried their seared ahi as well and really enjoyed it. 

I ate at the bar both times, the service was attentive, even when things got crowded. With all the TVs, it's my new go to place for catching a game and some good food."}
{"text":"I was a first time visitor to Babe's on a Friday afternoon. It was not busy, but still buzzing with people and I had a great waitress. My entree (the tortellini dish) was okay. There were the ends of the tomatoes mixed in, which is prefer to not eat. I was also expecting the dish to be more plentiful for the price. My mother ordered the fried cod lunch portion. Great fish with an excellent batter, but no coldslaw, which was odd. We both had the clam chowder, which was very good. Hearty cup too. 
For dessert, I had the homemade peanut butter cup. It. Was. Delicious. Super great price and a delicious end to the meal. 
Suggestion to the restaurant: if there was some graham cracker crust on the bottom, it'd be even better."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good bar food- and salads, too!  The buffalo chicken salad is great- as is the raspberry walnut chicken salad.  Good for lunch as well as after work.  Friendly bar, good service- nice staff!"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience there last night. I met two friends there at 4pm to watch the Cubs game and sat at a table near the bar. The female bartender (shorter curly hair, red shirt, white vest) seemed to be the only one working at the time so we kept going up to the bar to order drinks.  About 30 minutes later the bar got extremely busy and she was struggling to keep up and looked upset and unhappy and made unprofessional comments about patrons \"yelling\" to get a drink. Her demeanor was disappointing, but it gets worse. Noticing she was getting busy and overwhelmed, we flagged down a woman who was just starting to waitress the tables to get us drinks and more food. The bartender noticed this and yelled at the waitress that we were \"her table\" and that she would take care of us loud enough for us to hear and become uncomfortable. We obviously did not want her to serve us because it was taking 10 minutes to get a drink from that bartender, so we chose to keep the server and not go up to the bar for drinks anymore. The waitress we had was wonderful and accommodating, but the bartender AGAIN yelled at the waitress for servicing us. It was so awkward for us to witness and put a damper on our night. That's not even the worse part. When we asked to separate the food and drinks, the bartender bought the separate bills out (food & drinks) and we wrote a tip on each (one presumably for the bartender and one for the waitress who got us food). The bartender took these two back to the bar and we thought everything was fine, until we saw our waitress and told her we handed in the slip already. She went and asked the bartender for it, and the bartender said she \"accidentally\" threw it away. We couldn't believe it so then we asked the bartender and she said the same thing! Didn't apologize to us, and didn't print out a new slip for the waitress. I cant believe I witnessed such childish and unprofessional behavior from a bartender, yelling at patrons, yelling at waitstaff, she is just very unpleasant and makes people feel uncomfortable. I will not come here again as long as that bartender is working."}
{"text":"Our group of 6 came here on a busy Friday night and were able to secure a corner booth by the door. The manager came and greeted us and seemed genuinely grateful to have our patronage.  

Our group got a mix of the Friday night fried cod special, the cod tacos, and seafood enchiladas. They also had Long Islands specials for $4, which is a good deal considering their beers are $4.5+.

The dish our group was most impressed with were the cod fish tacos. Little nuggets of succulent cod were lightly fried, gently rucked in flour tortilla shells, arrived with a hidden delightful jalapeno mayo surprise within. It comes with a side of rice and refried beans. The fish was also raved, since it came with your choice of soup or salad, a side, and coleslaw. Take them up on the clam chowder, rivals all the other clam chowders in the area!"}
{"text":"Babe's is the best! 

Babes is a great place for dining, drinking and dancing. It's a great local restaurant and the service is awesome. There is nothing like a BLT on the patio along with a cold beer listening to some live music."}
{"text":"Stopped for a drink and an appetizer at the bar. Greeted as soon as we sat down. Great service. 

The restaurant itself is very nice/clean inside. They have a good selection of beers on tap. We ordered the nachos from the menu. It was a large portion, very good. I recommend checking Babes out. We will defianately be back."}
{"text":"Been on the patio for 20 minutes.  It's half full.  Babes' staff have walked past me at least 28 times without asking if I'd like anything.  One of them proudly displayed his gray and orange-colored  briefs.  Unfortunately, a very typical experience on the Babes patio.   Pathetic."}
{"text":"Wow!! I went there the other night, got a salmon sandwich and fries.. the salmon was 1/4 of the bun like 1.5\" wide. So I ate mostly bread, the fries were saggy, I asked few things on the sandwich, didn't get that either. 
Not the greatest place! My previous experiences there were not great either."}
{"text":"I am from California and have never been to Babe's, but I can tell you that I will be going there next time I visit Madison WI.  They searched for me over the web because they found a check that I wrote to someone for their graduation and they had lost it.  

Thank you to the customer of Babe's that turned it in too!  Babe's....good people and good customers!!!

God Bless!!!
RKR"}
{"text":"Unfortunately our experience wasn't the greatest and I don't usually write a bad review but I just couldn't let this go. We got seated right away and the waiter came over shortly after to ask for our drink order but our service after that went downhill. The restaurant wasn't full inside by any means but I assume they had a lot of people on the patio because we were seated near the door and the wait staff went in & out often. It took our waiter forever to take our order & then to bring out our food. There was a huge lag between getting our salads and entrees but I do have to say both of our dinners were good. The waiter never asked if everything turned out ok or if we needed anything else. In fact by the time he came back we were done with our dinner & pushed our plates to the side.  I guess it's lucky I didn't need anymore tater sauce or another drink cuz we would've been out of luck."}
{"text":"Met the owner a few times and it was obvious he is enthusiastic about his business. Babes is a nice neighborhood place."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Babes. The patio was perfect for a evening in late May. Awesome beer selection and a friendly server who had a great time flirting with my mom. 

My fish tacos were really really good, with fresh and colorful garnishes. The rice and beans were nothing to write home about, but I didn't have any room after the tacos anyway. Huge portions rule here. 

Everyone else at the table seemed very pleased with their big sandwiches. They disappeared entirety, and no one offered me a bite! Great fries, we all agreed. 

I would probably never come here to eat inside unless I was watching a game. There are SO many TVs. 

Really, if someone said \"Great Dane or Babes?\" on a nice summer night, I would definitely go with Babes."}
{"text":"Top-notch four star place that many would consider a five. Excellent food and tons of seating (which they need as they are very busy at dinner) Server was friendly and not overbearing which I prefer. Prices are fair but I'd suggest looking at the specials and going for rib night if you're deal seeker."}
{"text":"you can say yum   and on fri its $4 long islands yummm. portobello sandwich is good i though was beef and a portabella on top but no just a mushroom sandwich yum anyways. I like the workers there fun to talk with."}
{"text":"Great cheese curds, fabulous fish tacos (I had the cod).  Patio was nice, mosquitoes galore, not the restaurants fault, just June in Wisconsin.  Our server, Brandon, was great: funny; helpful; attentive.  Certainty worth a try."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time to meet up to watch a basketball game with friends. We had an excellent bar table right in front of a decent size TV.  Had their Friday Fish Fry and was very pleasantly impressed. Their baby red mashed potatoes would probably be something that I would not get again. Definitely a good place I'd go to again to watch sports and eat decent food."}
{"text":"Babes is an excellent place to watch sports or just relax on their patio during the summer months. We've been here twice already despite living in Madison for years, and were very happy sitting out in Babes lovely patio area that has nice shade trees and umbrellas. They have a terrific bar menu with an extensive whiskey menu, and great mix drinks. The food menu is pretty good too. Next time we will be stopping by for their Happy Hour. I will admit my knowledge of sports bars is limited but Babes has NONE of the earmarks of the typical bar hangout, like wet t-shirt contests, bands every single night, plastic cups outside and motorcycles doing donut holes in the parking lot. Just a fun and relaxing place to have a meal, watch a game and converse."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday. Busy. It was customer appreciation day. However, we aired 30 min for our drinks. Then when a buddy of mine went to the bar, got us out own, the server brought our second round at the same time he was getting back. Basically we had to leave beer on the table. Food was mediocre. I had been there about 2 years ago and what I had (buffalo chicken salad) seemed to be much worse. Oh and I asked the waiter for dressing as none was there but he never brought it. I used the other families left overs. Overall will not be going back at a busy time. They couldn't handle it"}
{"text":"This is a pretty typical bar and grill. I live nearby so I've visited a few times. Menu items are what you'd expect from a bar and grill. I dont eat meat so my options were very limited to a beet salad and fried appetizers. The beet salad was ok. There was too much arugula which made it very peppery, i would've enjoyed it more if there were a variety of greens. There weren't many components to it either so it was a fairly boring salad. 
Ive had better experiences just drinking here. Theres quite a bit of beer on tap and prices are reasonable. Pretty friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Love the blackened tilapia tacos and hand breaded chicken tenders. Babes also has a great sports bar atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for 10 minutes and both bartenders ignored me.  7 o'clock at night not acceptable will not be back."}
{"text":"Came in for a drink and to get some burgers to go. Chantal was very nice, attentive and went out of her way to get a kids menu so I could complete my food order. She and the other bartenders were helping each other very well and with smiles, a strong \"team\" atmosphere! I normally come here for lunch and am always impressed. The night staff seems to be just as good. Great service and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Great local bar! Okay food, good service, with excellent bartenders. I like the nachos -- huge! Recently this place has been a little dead. Babes recently opened a East side location. I'm a little worried about the food service/food quality of this location falling off."}
{"text":"Always great service.  Great beer selection and fair prices!  I order takeout and have a beer after work.  Always prompt service and food is very good!  The Babes Chips and Burgers are great"}
{"text":"good artichoke dip and veggie appetizer, and I LOVE teir portabella burger. 

I think they recently got a new manager and must have all been popped \"better be super-duper-extra happy friendly or else\" pills...its a little over the top.  Not fake, it does seem genuine, but a little too much."}
{"text":"This is a really tough review for me to write.  I love the ambiance of this restaurant.  Aside from one server, I usually get great service.  

However, the food and prices could be improved.  What stands out are the cheese curds.  It is rolling the dice as to whether they will be delicious or just piles of grease balls.  The oil pools in the bottom making the lower layer even more oily.  I think at $7.50, they could do something to make them a little crisper.  

I like their assortment of beer but the pitcher prices can really spike.  What is on special for $8.50 one week will double the next week.  Their prices are a bit steep.

Tonight I ordered carrot cake.  And I saw that it said pineapple in the description.  However, I was not expecting that it would alter the whole flavor profile.  It was a tropical, pineapple cake.  The frosting was not thick and creamy.  It was like a thin layer of fondant.  It had no real flavor.  Honestly, I can not express how disappointed I was in the cake.  I consider myself an aficionado of carrot cake and this was not carrot cake.  There was no strong punch of flavor.  It was kind of a sad little scare of cake."}
{"text":"Today (Sunday 1/21/18) we visited this establishment.  We were celebrating my future son-in-laws 35th birthday.  Our group of 8 consisred of: myself/my wife/my daughter/my grand daughter/future s.i.l and his parents.

This being my s.i.l.'s birthday, we had him pick a place. He selected Babes as his choice.

We arrived at around noonish and proceeded to find a place to sit while we were waiting for 2 people.  We sat at the bar area for a couple minutes.  About 5 minutes later,  the bartender walked over to where we were and told us that my granddaughter can't sit at the bar (state law (?).  So, we movered her over to another table to comply with the bartenders request.  I immediately proceeded to go sit by her.  In the process I approached the nearest adjoining table to which the waitress barked at me that the table was reserved so I proceeded to sit at a different table. BTW, the the bar was almost empty when we sat down

My future s-i-l saw what had taken place, and became irate at how we had been treated. He informed us that we were leaving and going elsewhere.

My concerns are as follows:

Not once did the bartender ask us if we wanted drinks which seemed odd.  Seemed to be pre-occupied with her busy work.  She hurt my 8 year old granddaughters feelings.

My suggestions:

   Sensitivity training for all employees

   Common courtesy....reminder that it takes      
   fewer muscles to smile than it does to frown

This is the first ever review that I have written
I could have requested to talk to the manager but this incident rose to a different level."}
{"text":"Decent food, though the burgers are much better than the rest of the menu. There are tvs everywhere, its a great place to hang out and watch sports. Good neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"A little out of the way for my usual haunt, but the place is clean and cozy.  Lots of TVs so it would be a good place to watch games.  The bartender was very sweet and attentive.  
The burgers are fresh and hand-pattied and absolutely delicious.  The fries were a little overdone, but tasty and there is a nice complement of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great Staff, food was delicious, and the bloody mary was fantastic.  Would highly recommend if in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Went here as a Marquette alum after MU's Alumni Association recommended it as the place guaranteed to watch NCAA Marquette basketball games. Was sitting at the bar watching it while eating during the Sweet 16 tourney. 20 mins into the game, the bartender turned the channel to a game that was also on the TV next it. Tried to get his attention but he ignored me. Told the manager and also the waitress and both said sorry and did nothing!! (OMG). I had to walk to the stack of to go boxes to get my own to pack up my food because no one was around. I left ZERO tip. I'm beginning to see why this place is so empty on game days. Rotten service. Get some decent bartenders and fire your mgr."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here because it's close to home.  

The food is okay.  It's your usual bar food, but they try and mix it up with seasonal menus.  We're often here for football games and also trivia nights.  It's a nice spot to watch a Packers or Badgers game since there were several big screens and tvs at nearly every viewing angle.  This place can be really busy during those times, but the waitstaff often does a good job of doing their best to find a seat to accommodate us.  

The bar selections leave something to be desired.  While they have a decent selection of beer, they don't have ginger beer.  Once I asked the bartender to make a hot toddy and she stared at me blankly.  I ultimately asked for the ingredients and made it myself."}
{"text":"Went here today.  Greeted promptly and in a very friendly manner.  The staff seems relaxed and happy here.  Professional.
Looks like a great sports bar.  Lots of room.  I will bring my friends and relatives here next time we want to catch a sporting event.  Tons of tvs and one large screen with plenty of room to eat and watch.   Could be a great time.  Super Bowl?
The place was very clean, nicely decorated, a nice thing to see, not thrown together.  We had great service and even other staff walked by and said hello to my surprise.   I ordered coffee but she first brought me a glass of water with a lemon slice.  Sounds simple but I really appreciated it and felt like they were really going the extra mile.  Really surprised me.  I played it safe and ordered a sandwich from reviews that said their entrees had problems.   Well my sandwich was excellent and with a nice portion.  The good service continued throughout the meal and we had a great time there.
Other people showed up while there.   Looks like a nice meeting place for some business people.  A family showed up with children.  A mix of professional and blue collar.  Both feel comfortable.   
I have driven past this restaurant numerous times and it looks more like an office building or bank than it does a restaurant.   The sign for the place is rather nondescript and so I never even realized that this was a restaurant until I heard about if from a friend and also saw it on Yelp.
They do have a board under their sign that says something about food but for the most part they could do themselves a favor and let people know that they are a sports bar better.  The staff all seemed very professional, I was impressed.  Something good is going on here."}
{"text":"Monday 1/2 price burgers with a purchase of any drink!
They have a selection of about 7 burgers, not bad for being just $5 after the deal.  We got sodas and the waitress was on point with getting us refills.  Only set back was she was not talkative or personable at all.  This is for sure a place we'll come back to again.  Burgers are super tasty!"}
{"text":"Food: 4
Service: 3
Uniqueness: 3
---------------------------------------

Babe's has seriously upped their game. Their menu has gone through quite a few adjustments over the past few years but they've really settled on some pretty solid offerings! The avocado steak quesadilla is awesome and the nachos are definitely great game day fare. Word to the wise, the flatbreads are definitely meant for 2 or more as they are HUGE.

The ambiance is also incredible to catch a Badger or Packers game with some of their staff being former UW band members. 

The one black mark against them is that for some reason (even on non-game days) the service can go non-existent for long stretches. 

I highly recommend Babe's for a Saturday or Sunday football game as the crowd makes the entire place feel like you're at the game."}
{"text":"The Yelp listing for this is gastropub is definitely laughable.  Babe's is a sportsbar serving decent food but nothing close to the level or sophistication of a gastropub.  It's a fine place for a quick work happy hour but I wouldn't venture out of my way to actually eat here.  Definitelya ho-hum type of experience."}
{"text":"Underwhelming, the food was just not good. It was flavorless and lacked passion. The quality was lacking, last time I was there the food was awesome, this time it left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Pros: Great prices, best BBQ burger I have had since I came to Wisconsin, curly fries are to die for, service is quick - even on a Saturday night, phenomenal live music, generous with the alcohol in the cocktails, patio is perfect for any date

Cons: May have to wait to be seated when packed, out of the way

Overall: Would happily make this a go-to Saturday night spot!"}
{"text":"I recently went here excited to eat all the delicious food and drink their unique cocktails... and was really disappointed. It seems like every time I come here, they have changed something, and never for the better. The biggest change this time was when I asked for a drinks menu. \"Well, we don't really have a cocktail menu, but I can give you our beer and wine list.\" What? No cocktail menu? This place literally advertises itself as a cocktail bar. Last time I was here there was a full list of different seasonal cocktails to choose from. I sighed and settled with a beer, served to me in a cracked glass. \"At least I can still get my sliders!\" I thought to myself. I scoured the menu... no pretzel bun sliders in sight. Strike two. I ended up getting their pot roast, served over mashed potatoes, and their raspberry salad. The pot roast didn't look appetizing, but it was delicious! I filled up on it pretty quick - it was a huge portion! Sadly for the salad, I was way too full from the pot roast to enjoy it much. From what I did have, the salad was equally delicious. 

The food was good, I'll give them that. There was also a live band playing which was pretty nice. This placed used to feel like a place any age could dine at and now it feels like it's reserved for anyone over the age of 40. 

There is nothing drawing me to this place anymore, so I don't see myself returning by choice any time in the near future. Nor do I think I would recommend it to others. 

The one thing that hasn't changed: I still stood around awkwardly waiting for a host for a couple minutes before someone showed up. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to wait, or seat myself. At least put a sign up!"}
{"text":"Great place to catch a big game.  2 big projection screens, many more TVs and great sound.

Beer list is extensive.  Standard American bar and grill fare, but what I've had they did fine or well.  The cheese curds would make my top 5 if they weren't so salty.  Go with the onion rings instead.  We have had great service here, though one night we went recently it was DEAD and we were nearly the only people there."}
{"text":"I came for lunch and the food was great (good thing I wasn't in a rush, though. Service was very slow.) my husband and I went for dinner and the service was still slow, despite the restaurant being nearly empty. My pasta dish was not good. The pasta was over cooked, the sausage was cold, and the save had absolutely no seasoning. It's like they opened a can of diced tomatoes and dumped it on top. To top it off, the women's bathroom was disgusting! We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times now and I will say it's a pretty good sports bar atmosphere. The latest time here we came for trivia on a Tuesday. I was very impressed by how many people showed up. 

There was a decent tap list with a good variety of options. As for the food, we got an order of cheesecurds for the table to split. They were the standard WI deep fried cheesecurds. Always a classic and not overly greasy or breaded. We also split a California wrap with French fries, no mayo. It was a typical cold wrap, but I did appreciate that they use tomatoe basil wraps as opposed to just a flour tortilla. Also I ordered thos with the intention of giving the bacon init to my friend, be advised the bacon is more like bacon bits. Also for some odd reason our wrap was partially ripped, so when I picked it up all the ingredients kind of fell out onto the plate. The fries were a good consistency, but a little salty for my taste this time. I've been there previously and they were a little better. 

Still I would say this is always a good option in Madison to go watch a game or just go for lunch or dinner. There is a great variety of options and also an outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Second visit here and I've noticed big improvements since my last visit. Very sizeable restaurant with great ambience. If you're a sports fan you won't be disappointed since they have many big screens playing the your fave sports teams. Our server was very friendly and helpful with giving recommendations from the menu which she said was newer. We were with the kids, so we opted for their nachos to share. We heard that they're known for their nachos and they did not disappoint. We got one beef and one chicken. We were split as a family as to which one was better. It's all preference. All in all very good and I'd like to come back with my wife and try one of their entrées."}
{"text":"The appetizers are what I loved, especially the nachos and potato skins.  It would be really nice if Babes could tone down the air fresheners.  They are over powering and detract from the experience."}
{"text":"This is now my second time here. The food is great. On my first visit I had a cheeseburger, don't remember the name if it but the meat was infused with bacon so it was amazing. My second visit was yesterday. Beautiful weather so my sister, sister-in-law and niece ate outside. We started out with a half of nachos, which were good but would have been better with the cheese more evenly distributed throughout the chips. I ordered the turkey and brie sandwich was great. Different from your typical sandwich. I would not recommend the coleslaw as your side item. My sister got the Cajun chicken Alfredo which described as, \"not the best thing I've add but also not the worst\" and wouldn't order it again. My sister-in-law ordered a Cobb salad which she enjoyed quite a bit and the presentation was beautiful. Surprised I didn't take a picture. 
Our server was attentive. He clearly had experience around kids and my niece is just under a year. He was careful not to place anything, like our beers, within her reach.
Will definitely be back. My only service complaint would be when we entered the restaurant, both hostesses ignored us like they had no idea what we were doing. I greeted them and then they asked us in a confused tone if we wanted a table. The lack of common sense and friendliness on behalf of those is the only reason this isn't a 5 star review."}
{"text":"I go there for trivia, but have experienced both the bar and food. The bartenders are always friendly, as are the bar-area waitstaff. The food I have had has been great! The nachos are a great choice for bar hang-out food."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Madison and I wanted to go to a fish fry. I chose the Bluegill, my wife went with the Cod. Both dishes were excellent. I would definitely recommend Babe's if you are interested in a fish fry."}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar and restaurant for the West Side. It gives you the feeling of being closer to the stadium or Kohl Center without the parking hassles. Menu is great as is the beer selection. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a great patio happy hour location. Unfortunately, this place didn't meet expectations. This is the first place I've actually got up and left my table. On one occasion, I patiently waited over 20 min, with no service; My partner and I weren't even acknowledged by passing wait staff. To put the nail further in the coffin with this location, it's not the first bad experience I've had here. The only positive point to this place is their outdoor patio. Just be prepared for dirty tables and understaffed waiters/waitresses, bartenders and hosts. It'll be a long time until I try to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"5 stars for the company, 4 for the atmosphere, 3 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service, 1 is the loneliest number... wait what...

All in all, not too shabby Babe's but I'm not gettin' in the car tomorrow to go back. The place is sizable and at 6pm on a Wednesday it wasn't too crowded. Definitely seems like the place to go in a group, I bet they'll accommodate you. I was there with an old college friend and it didn't really matter what the food tasted like (average) or that the service was slowish, we were just happy to catch up. If TGIFridays and Red Robin had a baby, they'd call it Babe's. Trivia night draws a decent sized crowd and the beer selection is ample. Go knowing your thirst will be quenched but for food... eh."}
{"text":"Speaking only from a Sunday brunch experience, the brunch \"special\" items were uninspiring but functional. Our waiter said all the right things but was already walking away as soon as the words left his mouth. 

Bottom line, it's a sports bar with tables."}
{"text":"Ended up at Babes for the Tuesday night trivia, but I will definitely return for the giant televisions and Monday night half-price burgers. The atmosphere is great for friends getting together for appetizers and drinks, groups, a date, bringing your parents, or stopping in to watch the game. The cheese curds are amazing, the burgers are big and juicy, and only $10 with $0.50 per topping. So it was $11 for my blue cheese and bacon burger with fries! And they have a plate of nachos that literally had us staring at the next table for 30 minutes trying to figure out how deep the toppings went.... spoiler alert-the toppings went all the way to the last layer of chips. I had never heard of Babe's before I ended up there for trivia but I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of happy hours at Babe's.  My brother does trivia there.  Heck, they sponsored my softball team years back.  We go way back.  But this week they really stepped up for my family.  We needed a place to host us after my father's funeral.  With only 24 hours notice, they were able to get us some space (the banquet room was occupied) and hook us up with food.  Sure, that's what they do, but Lynn was so compassionate and ready to help us out.  

While we were making the arrangements, we had a late lunch there.  The philly was amazing.  The food has changed since I was last there.  I really enjoyed the cheese curds too.  The onion hoop I swiped from my Mom's plate was pretty great too.

When we got the gang there today, the food was ready and it was tasty.  From sweedish meatballs, to honey BBQ boneless wings, to the veggie tray.  All done with quality and class.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The pricing was reasonable, too.  Considering we didn't give Babe's much time, they stepped up and took care of us.

Everyone commented on how perfect it was.  I agree.  Thank you, Babe's - you made a difficult day a little easier."}
{"text":"Ugh. Just horridly bad all around. Had to meet a group here, otherwise I would have never set foot in this place. Decor is out of the mid-90s. Rude, smug attitude is totally 21st century. Got the stink-eye from staff and customers alike. Bartenders were stuck-up, unhelpful, and inattentive. I could barely get them to make eye contact with me. After asking one staff member if he could help me find my group, he muttered something about how they never made a reservation, weren't there, or something something as he abruptly walked away from me. Wow, what a rude little prick. I almost ordered food until I saw an example of the huge, overpriced plates of Sysco crap that they serve. After even the Trivia hostess made a nasty comment to me (I'll let you, the reader, imagine what it was- hey Trivia hag: nice Betty Page bangs, you're SO stylish... snicker...), I gave up, paid my tab and left. I will never, ever return.

And, it turns out: the group I was supposed to meet WAS there. Thanks for nothing, y'all."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place, but they changed their cheese curds a little over a year ago and they are so much worse. The rest of the food is very good but I wish they would go back to the old recipe. They always have cream of chicken and wild rice soup which is great for a soup lover like me!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Slow and uncoordinated delivery of food (three people got their food, the other three waited for twenty minutes for theirs with no explanation from the server). The restaurant was not busy and there seemed to be plenty of servers so it's unclear what the issue was. Food was just ok; the kids' meals were decently priced with good portions."}
{"text":"Bring your smart friends If you come for trivia Tues or Wed nights.  It was packed, barely finished in the top ten. .. many taps and curly fries made it great night with friends in this friendly environment."}
{"text":"We have been there before and the food has always been good and the service, too. However, we went there a month ago, and there weren't many people there. Because of that, we thought our food would come fast, but it was the slowest service ever! The baked fish was cold, and our friend, who usually doesn't say anything, complained. They gave him fish again, and it was extremely hot. My fish also was lukewarm to cool, but I ate it because I was starving. It was very disappointing! People a few seats over order fajitas, and they smelled burnt. I will give them another try, but I will definitely not be going there for fish anymore."}
{"text":"Wow, exceeded my expectations. Services on a busy badger basketball tournament game Friday was professional and efficient. Watched the game plus two others simultaneously. Drinks are honest. Atmosphere is less crowded than other options like BW3. Food including curds and sandwiches with veggie soup was above average. So glad we tried this."}
{"text":"The food is good. And definitely go with the curly fries as the side! But what I like the best is that they have so many TVs on the wall, with a good atmosphere, and huge space. So even if there are too many people, you still don't feel too crowded by bumping into others.
Heard that their cheese curds and nachos are the best. But my stomach did not have much room left after my meal. Need to try that next time then get this updated :)"}
{"text":"Good enough service and decent food for a sports bar. I enjoyed my fajitas and fried cheese curds. It seemed that everyone else in my party enjoyed their food as well. 

There was a huge projector set up to play the game against a wall and there was a table of people setting up their fantasy football draft. 

All of these really added to the \"neighborhood sports bar feel\"."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on business trip. Ordered the ribeye steak sandwich special.  The steak was very chewy the onions over cooked and smashed potatoes cold.   
The place was empty.  Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I grew up going to Babe's pretty much every Friday, and I always remember never loving it as much as everyone else did. We haven't been regulars there in the past few years, so when it was suggested to go there last night I was excited to try it out again. And I was NOT disappointed at all! I got the salmon burger (with a huge beautiful glob of guacamole) and a baked potato and would've eaten every last bite if I could. The food was a delicious & filling portion, the variety of drinks were cheap and yum (I ordered a $5 hard cider bigger than my head), and our waitress was really wonderful. My family got salad, burgers, quesadillas, clubs, and the Friday night fish fry & there were no complaints. I'm excited to go back and try more of their fish/vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Had my 30th birthday here.  We reserved their banquet meeting room, which could accommodate a very large group of your friends.  On top of that, and which was a complete surprise to us, you have a personal server that is only assigned to you.  Drinks, food, decorations, etc., it's all at your disposal.  Speaking of food, wow was it delicious!  We did a pasta buffet with a choice of Alfredo or marinara sauce

If you are looking to host a party, this is the place to have it!  Will have dinner there again soon."}
{"text":"We started playing trivia here on Tuesday nights, so wanted to sample a few things before writing my review.  I think what it comes down to for me is they have awesome salads and the other food I have tried is mediocre.  Cobb salad is really good, and a 1/2 is plenty.  The Babe's salad is also very good.  Now the mediocre...nachos...how do you screw up nachos?   The description lists them with toppings of diced tomatoes, black olives, jalapenos, cheddar cheese and topped with green onions.  There is the option to add beef, buffalo chicken or chicken mix.  Chicken mix comes with green pepper and onion.  This is the one we chose but when they arrived it was a layer of chips fused with cheesed and some chicken sprinkled on top.  None of the other toppings were anywhere to be found.  Chicken strips look more like clam strips and were overcooked and tough.  Burgers are OK, but nothing special.   Service is spotty.  My beverage is usually ice water with lemon...the majority of the time no lemon is included and it is like pulling teeth to get a water refill.   Bottom line I guess is come for the trivia and salads and get bar food elsewhere?"}
{"text":"A big sports night, but the place was empty. The food was plentiful and delicious. Our server was nice, but she didn't know much about their massive beer selection."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to Babes so I could come here more often! 

I had been here several times just for the bar. Every time was enjoyable. Attended a going away party here at the bar once that was a lot of fun. Bar tenders are nice and attentive. Drinks are delish. Overall good times. 

Came yesterday for the Fish Fry. When we arrived the parking lot was FULL. We were immediately worried there would be a long wait, crowded, etc. Nope! Walked in and we were sat right away! Awesome!

Service was speedy and very friendly. We both got fish. BF got perch while I opted for cod. Both were great, though I think I would choose perch next time. It was so good!! It honestly reminded me of my childhood. Aw. 

Everything else was great as well. The soup, the salad, the baked potato. Yum! 

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Seemed like a great place. It was! From the outside. No one greeted us to seat us...the bartender told us to take a seat anywhere we want. No server ever came, mind you we were literally the only table inside (3 were outside). Made eye contact with several servers. No offer for drinks while we wait...no \"sorry I'll be right with you\"
Do not see any reason to ever go here again."}
