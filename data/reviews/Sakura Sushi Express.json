{"text":"I loved this restaurant the first few time but the last time I ate here the sushi wasn't fresh at all.  We had take out and when we opened the container, the smell was awful.  We didn't trust it so we threw it out.  None of us dared to order from this restaurant ever again."}

{"text":"Best sushis ever. Always fresh ingridients. Great service."}
{"text":"One of the best sushis you can get in St-Bruno for quality / price. Fish is always fresh and sushis specialty are awesome. Service is quite fast, especially if you take out.

I recommend this place if you are in a rush and want to take some food out."}
