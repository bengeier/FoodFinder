{"text":"First off the counter person seemed as if she did not want to even be there.  She told us that we should reuse our salad bar plates instead of  giving us new plates as per state regulations:

State of Wisconsin
Departments of
Health & Family Services,
Agriculture, Trade & Consumer Protection

7.8 Operators shall prohibit reuse of soiled tableware by self-service consumers
returning to the service area for additional food. Consumers may only return to selfservice
beverage dispensing units when the actuation levers or mechanism and
filing device is designed to prevent contact with the lip contact surface of the cup or
glass. Operations that permit additional servings shall provide clean plates or
bowls for additional servings. In order to ensure compliance, management shall
conspicuously post a notice of this requirement or have employees advise each
customer that a clean plate is needed for additional servings. (Food Code,
Appendix A, 3-304.16, 4-204.13).

Also found it weird that the rolls that come with the salad bar are covered with cinnamon and sugar.  They do not go very well with a salad.

Last but not least the only good thing about the slice of pizza was the sausage, of which they skimped on.  The slice was old and dry, but by this time we were ready just leave at this time.  So for one Super Slice two salad bars and two small sodas our total was almost $25.  For that price we should be able to expect better service and better quality.  Total wast of time and money."}
{"text":"Didn't honor online prices from their own website.  The kid at the counter was clueless.  The manager didn't know about the specials on their website and would not give me the advertised prices.  Emailed their corporate office to find out what the deal was but I got no reposes from them.  The restaurant tried to call me a couple times, but if the corporate office can't take the time to talk to an upset customer, then I don't have the time to visit their restaurant.  I wasn't a huge Rockys fan in the past, and this sealed the decision to never return."}
{"text":"We picked up some pizza to go from Rocky's on our way to House of Brews. The brewery, located a few minutes away by car, allows you to bring in your own food and it was a good excuse for us to revisit one of my childhood favorites.

Originally opened in Madison in the mid 70's, the chain has a mascot who's a reference to a character from the Firesign Theatre, a Los Angeles-based comedy troupe know for surrealistic humor on live radio programs and recorded albums.  The chain used to have restaurants all over the midwest, but now they're almost exclusively found in Wisconsin. The pizzerias really focus on their eccentric mascot, who looks like a Panamanian tailor in a fedora or a WWII propaganda piece against Italians. 

Stepping into Rocky's is a 1990s time capsule. Little has changed with Rocky's pizza in the past couple decades. They still have posters of Signor Rococo all over the place, they still sell square-shaped, pan style pizza with their signature Italian-spiced, meatball-sized sausage (among other possible options, although I prefer their sausage pizza), and they still offer butter-lathered breadsticks served in paper cups.  It's greasier than your average pizza and I don't understand why they throw a sheet of plastic over it inside the box, but it tastes and smells just as I remember it from birthday parties and school events.

I wouldn't go as far as saying Rocky's pizza is extraordinary, but it's definitely fun to revisit it and reenter an unchanged scene with all the same sights, smells and decor from 20 years ago."}
{"text":"When Rocky's is good it is very good.  However it is always a hit or miss. Today was the worst pizza I have ever had. The bread sticks were hard as croutons and my pizza was barely warmer than room temperature and looked as if it was made hours before. My husbands also was just as bad."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner Monday night, after trying 2 other restaurants that were closed.  
It was actually good!  I say that because, it's usually a doughy mess.  Quite good this time, plenty of sauce."}
