{"text":"Disagree with the negative comments.   Scramble - A Breakfast Joint and its companion in Scottsdale - rock!  If you are looking for breakfast and brunch than you have found the right place.  The pancakes are filling and amazing.  The sweet potato hash - BAM that just happened! Our favorite... the southwest / Santa Fe eggs from the Egg Whisperer.  Wow.  Great place.  Great food."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Orange juice is the best! Servings are just the right size. Kids menu is super easy to please the little diners!"}
{"text":"Great service and staff, dog friendly patio (will even bring your dog a water bowl).  Hashbrowns are super tasty. Had the morning scramble and it did not dissappoint, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I love the Brizzas and paninis! Scrambles is my favorite breakfast place. You can check out my review on my blog: www.lyndsaycabildo.com"}
{"text":"I visited my friend for her birthday on May 21, and wanted to treat her to brunch today.  She chose Scramble in Scottsdale and I am so glad she did!  The service was exceptional and we were greeted with a smile.  I love how they have the menu posted on the window at the entrance and then the over-sized version on the left wall as one enters.  The variety of fresh and delicious food options that were available was phenomenal.  I earned points towards rewards on our visit.  I will definitely return on my next visit from New Jersey!"}
{"text":"I give it 2 1/2 stars if I could figure out how to do 2 1/2. Fresh OJ wasn't very fresh. Fruit wasn't particularly great.   I got the Southwest burrito - it was OK, not the best chorizo I've had. Will not be going out of my way to return anytime soon....  May be a good choice if you're in a rush and don't care that much about really awesome food."}
{"text":"Tasty fare but unfriendly and immature staff.  They tainted our breakfast experience.  The staff needs to be coached to smile and at least acknowledge the patrons.        A staff like the ones working  morning weekday could tank a business."}
{"text":"My favorite vegan breakfast place that has non-vegan options. Fun for the entire family and they have mimossas!"}
{"text":"Table service quality for a walk-up numbered table delivery place. The 11 year-old reports \"best bacon ever,\" and he has plenty of basis for comparison. Hash browns had great seasoning. The omelette was good, but it's hard to screw up an omelette."}
{"text":"Went into scramble today with my living social I bought. Ordered and was going to skip toast option.. Once I sat I was like I do want toast. I had only used 12.00 of the 15.00 coupon I had. I ordered toast from waiter he brought me toast and a $2.00 bill. When I explained I still had money left from coupon. He explained it was only good for one visit..umm that's funny I am on my one visit. My first visit and my last I won't be back. Since breakfast club and morning squeeze rock it. Pamela"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Went there every morning, they have vegetarian chorizo, delicious burrito! Fast service, great fresh food! Patio is nice, dog friendly."}
{"text":"Ive eaten hashbrowns at many breakfast places, and drank chai teas at many coffee shops. Scramble is my favorite for both. They have a menu that is unique from other places. It includes breakfast burritos and breakfast pizzas (brizzas) which are both fantastic and I would recommend. If you want to spruce up your hashbrowns, try the scrambled browns. Overall, great choices and great food.  Shout out to the servers: You girls are so sweet. I know how some people can be when you work in the service industry. You are appreciated."}
{"text":"The older fellow working at the front would not let me order what I wanted and he made me get some spicy vegan burrito that had no warning of the HEAT!!!!!!!! I hated it!!!!! I'm grossed out. I am not completely against this place but I want my money back. Not good hang over food I want to puke I'm very mad"}
{"text":"Excellent tofu scramble and vegan french toast. Wish there was one closer to where I live, but it was a welcome vacation breakfast treat."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Incredibly rude staff. I ordered a Chicken Bacon Panini. I thought it would be great. Came out wrong the first time so I asked for it to be made as asked the previous time. They gave me a look and remade it, giving the impression that I was the one who made the mistake. It came out the second time and it did look good. I started eating it, and noticed the quality of the chicken was so bad. Honestly i didn't even want to eat it. I walked up to the front to ask for a to-go box. When I got up, the woman at the smoothie bar quickly said \"what, you didn't like your bacon?\". This was exceptionally rude and I responded \" can I please have a to-go box\" and walked off.   I would not recommend this place. The staff just makes it feel so uncomfortable. Specifically the girl at the smoothie bar at 11am on May 29 needs to be let go."}
{"text":"One of the biggest disappointments I have seen in awhile  - come on, how hard is it to make amazing breakfast?  I had the Egg Sandwich.  Un toasted white bread soaked in butter with process cheese?  I will give it one more chance."}
{"text":"While visiting my sister in Phoenix we stopped here after church on Easter Sunday. The location was very easy to find. Our food was great, we ate on the patio, the service was amazing. The pricing was a little high, but other than that I really enjoyed this place. Also, they are pet friendly!"}
{"text":"The service was pretty good, but this food was far from worthy of the four-star average Scramble has. Hollandaise tasted like literal cardboard, ham was bland, and the hash browns were soggy. There are too many great breakfast restaurants in the area to bother with crappy food!"}
{"text":"Food was good, I had the chorizo scramble, pancakes and a jalapeno infused bloody Mary. I would or order the scramble again but not the pancakes or BM. The Bloody Mary taste like tomato juice and ice."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Love the vegan breakfast burrito with soyrizo.  They make sure its a good size burrito and the prices are reasonable.  The only thing i didn't like was the potato hash that comes with the burrito.  It would be cool of they did regular hash browns with it.  ;).   I recommend getting fruit on the side instead. The people that work their are friendly.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I have to say the whole experience was just ok.  After waiting in line for 15 minutes while several (5) employees walked by me but didn't offer to open another register when there was only one couple ahead of me I sat and waited another 15 minutes for my breakfast.  I got a burrito which was fine, nothing special but nothing to complain about.  I thought it was a little pricey considering it is a small step above fast food. Don't go if you are in a hurry.  Lot is a little hard to get into but the restaurant is very bright and clean, too bad it wasn't a better experience."}
{"text":"My absolute best and favorite breakfast spot. The sunrise sandwich is my favorite!! The people are awesome and the place gs good vibes!!"}
{"text":"Great stuff. The staff was awesome. Our little one was quite happy with her pancakes."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and helpful but the food is too simple. The French toast looked good, and I really appreciate having several vegetarian/vegan options but I could have made my burrito at home for less money. My table mates really enjoyed their Brizza. There are also several funny spelling errors on the restaurant decor."}
{"text":"I love their brunch and vegan menu. Everything taste amazing, starting from the smoothie, eggs, scramble, etc. the service is fast and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Nice setting, bathrooms were very clean. Food was okay. We both got lunch - I didn't care for mine and ended up not even eating half of it. My panini was suppose to have avocado on it - it didn't - they were out I was not informed until I took a bite and asked. All in all the breakfast food that other people got looked a lot better."}
{"text":"Clean, fresh, healthy & decently priced breakfast place. Service is quick and food is tasty and not overly portioned."}
{"text":"Scramble is consistent with their service, food taste and quality. When my family is discussing where to have Sunday breakfast, it's a unanimous decision to eat  at Scramble."}
{"text":"I was drawn by the ambience and options for gluten free menu items. The place looked clean and has lots of options for egg/omelette lovers. We ordered the French toast brioche for the kids from the kids menu- this was basically a whole baguette cut in half and toasted served with butter and maple syrup and a few pieces of melon. I was flabbergasted when I saw the two huge pieces! My kids have good appetite but no way they can just eat an entire baguette! They were not prepared well- it was not soaked in egg batter and also some parts were burned and some parts were not fully cooked through. We also ordered the garden scramble with hash browns. This was decent ana hash browns were nice and crispy. I ordered a side of plain gluten free bread for $4.29! Umm, a whole loaf of udis bread costs $4.00. The sweet potato hash was prepared like a party rather than traditional hash, not a fan. Giving two stars for the cashier, she was super friendly and triple checked to make sure our order was correct. The concept is great but needs cooks/chef that knows how to prepare food. I hope they are successful!"}
{"text":"Best bacon and hash browns EVER. We were in town for the Alabama vs Clemson game and came here for brunch on our last day. A great ending to an awesome weekend. ROLL TIDE. We will definitely eat here on our next visit."}
{"text":"Fresh, healty, and great strong coffee! Service is awesome, always clean."}
{"text":"The soyrizo burrito and coffee were good. We had a bagel also which was not fresh nor tasty. It had the feel of a lenders frozen bagel."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great. The staff was super friendly and accommodating to our dog. Think the jam options could be a little classier:)"}
{"text":"1st time here for breakfast.  Passed it many times and thought we would give it a try.  It has clean looking and contemporary feel to it and I think it probably works great for the childless free wheeling set but the only thing kid friendly about his place is the quality precision made German high chairs that are stacked up in the corner. I think they have a market that they are successful in and they really set the place up to work for that.  Just didn't work for kids, and I have a few so perhaps I'm asking this place to be something it is not.  As far as the food goes most everyone was satisfied but the food lacked character.  My 19 year old loved the Sunrise Sandwich but that was the only really positive comment on the food. The only bright spot for this experience was the service.  Everyone in the place seemed genuinely happy to be there. They answered all of our questions completely and confidently knew the menu and really made us feel welcome.  I really want to know who staffed the place so I can hire them to run hr at my company."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing breakfast, steak and eggs were both cooked prefect which is rare these days."}
{"text":"Friendly staff ( thanks Audrey), quick service, and food done just the way we asked.  No fancy frills but simple, clean, and cheery decor - love the orange trim.   Only drawback:  needs longer hours, as it now closes at 2 pm."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the area. Everything is made to your specifications. Top quality ingredients bacon crispy and perfect. How can you go wrong with applewood bacon you can't here. Fresh squeezed orange juice. Yes I had pancakes they were so fluffy and light. There is so much more here to choose from that will delight your palate. This place is a must for an exceptional breakfast experience."}
{"text":"I had the southwest burrito with regular cream cheese instead of jalapeño cream cheese and bacon instead of chorizo and it was the best burrito I've ever had! The service was awesome! I'm defiantly coming back!"}
{"text":"nice patio set-up and extremely quick service. Nothing over the top, but would definitely visit again. I had the Southwest Breakfast Burrito and my husband had the ham breakfast sandwich, both were tasty"}
{"text":"Manager took and repeated order for a gf breakfast sandwich. Halfway through realized it was not gf. Spoke to him he didn't even apologize. Heading home to deal with consequences. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Let's talk Huevos Rancheros... nom nom nom! When you walk in the menu is on the wall and you order at the counter, but what I love the most is that all of the items on the menu are labeled GF, Veg, Vegan, and locally sourced if possible. I loved the atmosphere and the staff was great, I will be back. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We found this hidden gem while searching for a breakfast spot to eat this morning.  Amazing food, clean, and hospitable.  I had the steak and eggs and hubby had pancakes with an egg scramble.  I rate it overall a 5 of 5.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ambience - Very good.  Food - Can't believe they don't know how to cook a simple French Toast (I posted two pictures of the french toast)  Price: reasonable in general, however, they charge $4.29 for two tiny slices of GF bread...hilarious that they were defending the prices too."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. If you don't arrive early you will be waiting in a long line and tables are limited. The employees are friendly and fast. I like the large, open space and tall ceilings. Nice music playing, yummy food, and great presentation."}
{"text":"Like that you can order online for pickup. Very cool concept and awesome pet friendly patio (not great in the AZ summer heat obviously!)."}
{"text":"Great food and service. They have a dog friendly patio with plenty of shade to keep you and your pup happy. Will definitely come back soon ."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place. Like the decor-always looks sparkling,  fresh and clean.   We like the outdoors and like the fact that you can bring dogs"}
{"text":"Second time was not a charm. The food remained just okay. Not bad, not good. Too many other good places to go for breakfast. And it's not cheap considering its counter service."}
{"text":"This food is so good! Very friendly people. We all enjoyed ourselves. The gentleman at the register was informative which helped in the ordering process. I wish all places had good service and products like Scramble. Anyhow, I can see myself returning. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! I got the french french toast, which was prepared perfectly in vanilla custard. My wife and I split a cinnamon roll as well and WOW! The cinnamon roll is worth the visit alone. It was so good in fact, we came back the next morning and got another cinnamon roll! It's a little on the pricey side for a fast casual entree is my only gripe. if you only get a cinnamon roll or a muffin, it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I are visiting from LA for the weekend and our friends brought us here. The huevos rancheros and brizza are delicious, as are the bloody marys. They somehow manage to cook eggs perfectly! They have a great menu, the place is nice and clean, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We definitely look forward to coming back here next time we visit, if not again before the weekend's over!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick, delicious breakfast. Coffee was good. They also have mimosas and bloody Mary's which are always a plus in my book"}
{"text":"This place will do well because it's trendy and modern inside. A cool ambiance..the food is just ok. The hash browns had way too much salt in them. The mushroom, spinach scramble was dry and bland.. Huevos Rancheros were just ok. But hey, it's probably a hip place to be so food is secondary I guess."}
{"text":"Tried the seasonal special  (Sweet Potato pancakes with orange cranberry sauce) with turkey sausage patties.  The pancakes were not \"fluffy\" because the sweet potato makes the batter denser, but the favors were great and the breakfast was yummy.  I would order it again and actually would not mind being able to have that cranberry orange sauce on their regular pancakes year round. As usual, clean restaurant, great service and tasty fresh food.  P.S. I still miss the diced rosemary breakfast potatoes they had a couple years back - they replaced them with bland, soggy hash browns so I always have to substitute those out for something else on my regular visits.  I don,t know anyone who prefers those tasteless hash browns....which Scrambles would brink back diced breakfast potatoes."}
{"text":"We are superfans of this restaurant. With a wife and son who are vegan (and a husband -- me -- who's definitely not), Scramble covers all the territory with a smile. The service is friendly, the breakfasts are awesome (so awesome, in fact, we've never tried a lunch dish), and the place is clean. There's free coffee samples out front while you wait. Imagine that.   Scramble is a can't-miss for hangover brunches, families and catching up with friends. The vegan French Toast passes the Pepsi challenge: you can't tell the difference from the real thing."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Haven't ordered anything I didn't like. Very well done menu. The atmosphere is also very relaxed and comfortable. Love visiting for weekend breakfast. The breakfast pizza is the best around. Yum! Absolute favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Hostess guy said Yes, dogs on patio ok, just cant go in the restaurant...So i sat on patio forever, since I was with my doggie...finally was able to flag down a server to ask for a menu...waited around forever, nobody spoke to me so I finally left and the lady next to me asked me...and I said..Seems too hard to get waited on here?? And the customer stated, You are supposed to go inside and order. Well HOW ABOUT TELLING THE DOOR HOLDER HOSTESS GUY TO MENTION THAT. Thanks for wasting 40 minutes of my breakfast hour."}
{"text":"This is fast becoming one of my \"go to\" breakfast spots. They use quality ingredients and the dishes are prepared properly. The staff is friendly and efficient, so they are able to handle rushes in a timely fashion. The way the entire restaurant is setup and how it is run makes for an enjoyable dining experience!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I mean it is super cute and we need another breakfast place in the area. That being said, the coffee is awful. Coffee is the most important item at any breakfast place and their's tastes dreadful. My second complaint was the food. Don't get me wrong - it wasn't disgusting or anything, but I can make better breakfast at home so why should I go there to pay their crazy high prices for breakfast? It just isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"Quick breakfast, trendy breakfast food place.  I love going there on Sundays for brunch and their bloody mary is delicious!  My favorite is their Vegan Southwest burrito.  They do not skimp on the avocado, it's delish!"}
{"text":"Pitifully slow...50 minutes to receive my order (It's breakfast!!!) Ruining a good experience"}
{"text":"Dog Friendly patio Sunday Morning adult beverages !  Bacon infused Bloody awesome.  Come early busy little place."}
{"text":"In this bloated restaurant environment it is important to stand out; be it a creative menu, high food quality, and great decor. Unfortunately, Scramble misses the mark on all three. The food is suspiciously similar in taste and offering to that found at most fast food restaurants and your chain diners. The decor is pretty cool, but it is diminished by the institutional style dispensers, such as the coffee cream lineup, that makes you feel as if your food is over processed and mechanized- not exactly what people are looking for in 2017. If your expectation is Denny's quality with a patio, then Scramble won't disappoint. If you're looking for something more I'd keep driving."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday with the family and was not disappointed! The food is great and the prices are just right. The staff was friendly and fun- to match the atmosphere. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday late morning. Food was good, very fresh and healthy. Nice presentation. Reasonable prices. Service was average, but it was busy. Tables a bit tight, but at least we did not have to wait for one. I recommend Scramble and will go again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Local, fresh and always really friendly.  Very consistent and super clean atmosphere. Also a dog friendly patio which is a plus for me."}
{"text":"Basically on over priced Denny's, and that may be insulting Denny's. Things to avoid: huevos (basically eggs and taco meat scattered over bag chips), sweet potato hash (looks like feces, tastes like...), canned fruit cups... Place is wildly disappointing in a city with literally dozens of options within a mile. Should print their receipts on TP because you're going to need extra."}
{"text":"Let me keep this short and sweet...don't come here unless you're in a hurry. It's expensive terrible food. This is my second visit and hardly touched a thing on my plate. Hash-brown's must be pre soaked in oil, sausage is huge and flavorless the toast was hard and cold. Eggs were good and that's all that was good.  I gave 2 stars for good eggs, cleanliness and because of happy & friendly staff, but avoid this place...wayyyyy too many awesome places in the area."}
{"text":"I had the spicy bloddy mary and the spinach and mushroom scramble. They asked how spicy and accomodated my request. The food was served quicklly and it was very good."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place.  Great food and the staff us very professional and friendly!  I either order the chorizo brizza or kale salad."}
{"text":"About us:  My husband and I live in Scottsdale and go out to breakfast once every weekend.  I try to pick a different place each time because I'm adventurous and we haven't yet found a place to become a regular favorite.    This review is for the:  Scottsdale Road Scrambles location (September 2014).  Summary:  Atmosphere lacking for me, but food good.  A little spendy for what it is.  Fast, friendly service.  The atmosphere:  This is almost a cafeteria-style eatery.  The space is small, but bright with lots of windows and high ceilings; very open and also industrial (metal decor) and modern despite the wood laminate flooring.  Not a lot of personal, freestyle seating - there are bench seats and tables largely lining walls and partitions; you can easily get friendly with other parties seated next to you.  It's upbeat, noisy and active.    While none of that's bad, it's not what I like in a breakfast or dinner place - that really only works for me for lunch.  My preference for breakfast is somewhere comfortable and warm to ease into the day where the noise level is low, music is soothing, but happy, and where my husband and I can keep to ourselves enjoying coffee and food.  The process:  You need to check the menu, first, before ordering.  Then, you get in line and order at the front counter and pay beforehand like at a buffet, but with ordering from a menu instead of buffet.  Then, take your number, stop by at the beverage section to grab your coffee or whatever drink, and find your place to sit.  Someone will bring your food soon.    The food:  The food is just fine.  Cooked right, tastes good, no complaints, but definitely not a place comfortable enough for me to want to linger; more of \"please bring my food so I can eat and get the hell out of this chaos\" kind of place to me.  Now, there is some outdoor seating, that I'm assuming is quieter, but not sure, but when we went, it was too hot outside to try it (hello, Arizona, it's too hot most of the year to be outside).    End result:  I won't be going back unless I'm hanging out with someone who really wants to go there.  As a personal choice, it's a no."}
{"text":"Phoenix omelet and accompanying hash browns were very good. Toast was warm when served which is always a plus. I dislike cold toast!  Their regular coffee was average. Tasted acidic. Think Starbuck's Pikes Place which is their cheap standard coffee. The Italian roast was a bit better.  Parking is a bit chaotic as all store front spaces have do not park here signs."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place. No matter what I'm in the mood for, they have it. Food is fantastic and staff is always helpful. I tried the Chicago Brizza this last visit and now I have another favorite. Oh, and the hot sauce selection is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  Food was OK.  Went on Sunday around noon.  Line out the door, parking lot was packed with cars.  Didn't know what to expect.  It's a walk up and order, find a table and they bring you your food type of place.  Staff was super friendly. Had the Meat lover scramble - basically scrambled eggs w sausage, ham and bacon, side of pancakes (nice a fluffy!), hashbrowns.  Western omelet very similar to the scramble, toast and hashbrowns.  For $2.99 you get 2 slices of bacon."}
{"text":"Simple & great food. Easy to order, and fairly quick service. The only thing I regret is not trying some of the other dishes. Will definitely return next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Had voucher.   Went to pay. Allowed me to purchase another voucher.   Very good deal. Like a self serve cafeteria but they do bring you your food."}
{"text":"Had an amazing sourdough sandwich!! Wowza it was good!  Wish we had a Scramble closer to us!!! A bit of a line but moves quickly."}
{"text":"This was a great breakfast in a bright positive atmosphere!  Loved the veggie omelette.  Friendly attentive staff, who deliver your order and everything else is located at serve your self bar."}
{"text":"The chocolate chip pancakes were amazing! I got the veggie omelette it was very good, salsa was a good addition. My friend got the western omelette she said it was good but she got a side of sweet potatoes hash browns I thought we almost inedible. All in all a good experience was a little warm inside but all the servers were nice."}
{"text":"We came her for the vegan menu so automatic 5 star for that. We had their soyrizo burrito and they're vegan french toast....so.good. The one thing I would change is the sweet potato hash that they serve as a side, it's not very appealing and honestly isn't the best tasting, sorry! Maybe some old fashion vegan hash browns or breakfast potatoes would be best instead. Thank you for the lovely food and service"}
{"text":"The food wasn't worth the price, the staff wasn't very friendly, and i had a complaint that was disregarded with two separate employees-- both telling me i was wrong and they were right. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Wonderful alternative to a hotel breakfast.  Location was Great, staff was friendly and food was wonderful.  I appreciate the Turkey sausage option.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place gets it right. Amazing food, kind people and customer oriented.   It's perfect for both families and breakfast 'dates' with that special someone.   Oh, and the Scrambled Browns are amazing. I don't think I've ever not ordered them."}
{"text":"Interesting order-at-the-counter place in this part of Scottsdale. Ordering was easy and fast, which is hard to do on a Sunday morning in a place where brunch is a big deal. I love how many healthy options there are! Everything looked awesome. I got a scramble with hash browns and gluten-free toast and it was outstanding. Boyfriend and friend were also very happy with their orders. The coffee was great. Very clean and I wasn't surprised by how nice the bathroom was-- it just made sense after I saw how the rest of the place was. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing experience. Cute place but noisy. The bacon was good and the costa burrito was good. The hash browns were undercooked. Out first and last time!"}
{"text":"Beat Omellete ever! I had the western and Irish breakfast tea. We came back three times when we were in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"For a counter-order and seat-yourself kind of restaurant, the food and service here exceed my expectations.   The food is flavorful and fresh. The coffee has impressed me every time, never, ever bitter! The food is delivered to our table propmptly and servers always come back to check on our satisfaction and offer to bring us something addition if we want it. Our empty plates have always been removed.   This has become one of our favorite places for breakfast in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Stopped by to get some food before we left Scottsdale. Mid morning and I got the huckleberry French toast and the hubby got that Costa burrito with sweet potato hash.   We fell in love with huckleberries in Idaho so I was happy to see it on the menu. It was some delicious stuffed French toast. I highly recommend. I tried my hubbys burrito and it was packed with food and flavor.   They were very friendly there and the food came out really quickly. I would go back next time we were in the"}
{"text":"Great service and good food!  We arrived and were promptly greeted.  They were helpful with menu choices.  Food arrived correct and fresh.    Loved it!  Many condiment choices and really great service.  Very clean and good atmosphere.    Really can not say enough good about this place.  Must try the eggs Benedict.  Note:  people super sensitive to spicy items may want to ask about ingredients of spices when ordering"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Not necessarily healthy, and the pancakes underwhelm, (however the french toast is good) but I primarily stick to the breakfast wraps. We keep going back because the staff is so nice, there is bottomless coffee and it just has a good vibe.  Nice addition to the neighborhood.  PS please serve REAL maple syrup. Please please please. Not the corn syrup kind!!! Ick"}
{"text":"Always great food.  However when it's a Sunday @ 10:45am, in January, during the hight of tourist season, and the line is out the door....  how hard is it to have two cashiers that can take your order?.  Not the best or smartest of management."}
{"text":"Loud! Loud! Loud!  Why?  Do people really enjoy having breakfast where the music is as loud as the club they were in last night? I like to visit with friends over breakfast and be able to have a conversation, hear one another without screaming.  I can't think of any good reason to have the music so loud, and it's even louder in the bathroom."}
{"text":"This place has great service, atmosphere and food! When you walk in you are prompted to order at the counter and then they give you a number to put at your table. There are a lot of options for seating, including an outdoor patio. In the middle of the room there is a condiments section that has ketchup, various hot sauces, and all your necessities. It also has a fountain soda machine and coffee so you can refill for free.   There were quite a few people on laptops working and having meetings. So very business friendly. FREE WIFI!  The food came very quickly and it was delicious. I had the Bacon and Mushroom omelet and added avocado. The hash browns were yummy and crispy. I would definitely come back and recommend this breakfast spot to others."}
{"text":"Helene, the charismatic, friendly, attentive young lady at the front is reason enough to come here.  She was super welcoming as she realized that we were first timers and didn't know the process.  The \"process\" is to read the menu on the wall, place your order, take the number they give you to attach to the stand on your table, and wait for them to bring the food.  Easy enough.   Got the traditional eggs benedict with extra crispy hash browns.  My companion got the lox and bagel with capers/tomatoes.  Both were large portions.  I found the hash browns to be a little on the greasy side.  Too much butter or oil or whatever it was.  They had a lovely taste but my brain was ticking away the number of calories so I didn't finish it.  The eggs in the benedict were perfectly poached although the hollandaise sauce need a little more acid--meaning lemon.  The lox tasted good, not salty as some lox can be.  The tomatoes were a little on the hard side--- you know as when they are forced to ripen.   I did a Yelp check-in which yielded me a free coffee.  Yay! The environment was clean and welcoming, lots of choices on the menu, servers super nice and pricing very fair.  Definitely a breakfast destination if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Hell yeah!  Need one of these in NorCal.  Great concept, great food, great Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and cheerful staff make this a go to place in the morning. Try the hog and hen Sammie if you can't decide on breakfast or lunch. It's both, on a delicious bun. The oatmeal is stellar. So far, Scramble does not disappoint."}
{"text":"This breakfast place in Scottsdale is fast and easy. Friendly folks greet you and serve up some wonderful meals. This place is open, inviting, and very clean."}
{"text":"Great breakfast which was quick, healthy and just really well done. Had a pizza and scramble. Pizza is not small big enough for two to share."}
{"text":"Great little place. We stayed at a hotel down the street and this was in walking distance. Came through the door greeted right away even with a customer in front of us. First time here for my huaband and I the girl at the register explained the menu and how to order.  My husband loved his poached eggs, bacon and toast with fruit, I went old school and got chocolate chip pancakes and sausage with Iced tea. The pancakes were huge and very filling. Everything was great."}
{"text":"Happy staff and great food! Recently found this place and it will now be a regular spot!  Yea burrito and breakfast pizzas!!!"}
{"text":"Always get friendly fast food service here. Patio super convenient for kids and dogs."}
{"text":"We did an online order for take out. I loved that they had vegan options!  I enjoyed a very tasty tofu,spinach, mushroom scramble w/sweet potato hash. Delicious and full of flavor. My husband enjoyed a meaty scramble. We were even able to get all three of our kids a meal and not have them share; since their prices were very affordable. My girls enjoyed the whole grain dollar pancakes, French toast and scrambled eggs. The pancakes were a hit and the eggs. Over all a great food experience. My husband who picked up the meal even got a picture of the easter bunny at the location to show the kids."}
{"text":"Came here today after trying their other location. Both locations are excellent. Great selection of foods and high-quality too. The best part is their flatbread pizzas for breakfast! Very good and very unique. I recommend the egg, bacon, Gouda pizza. Was one of the better breakfasts I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Loved the design inside and you order first then sit. Kind of self serve but super quick service and really excellent food. Friendly and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times.   We love the patio.  It's dog-friendly and there are a lot of seats.  The food is pretty solid.  I recommend getting light seasoning, as they sometimes can overdo it, especially with the Steak and Eggs.  I also appreciate how many deals Scramble has.  Sometimes LivingSocial, often LocalDines ... always a way to save a little bit and get a lot of great food.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Super happy to see a breakfast place with some vegan options! (wish there was a bit more to choose from though) Today I ordered the vegan veggie scramble with a side of sweet potato hash and sourdough bread. The veggie scramble was actually pretty tasty and I added some siracha on top to give it a bit more spice! The sweet potato hash was nice as well but I'm not a huge sweet potato fan, if you are this is definitely for you! I also really enjoyed the sourdough bread. I added some vegan butter on top that came with the meal (smart balance buttery spread) and was really pleased with the taste! Pro tip: add the scramble onto the toast for extra yum! Overall if you're a vegan and going to get brekkie with an omnivore, this is a nice place to go."}
{"text":"You would think since they eliminated the labor cost of order takers their prices would not be so inflated. Not impressed with the value or the time it took to get my overpriced meal."}
{"text":"This is a top 5 breakfast place we have eaten at when visiting Arizona. Service was outstanding.  You order upon entry, take a # and find a seat. Service could have ended there but they came over a few times to make sure all was great.   Food was awesome. I got the gluten free Chicago Brizza. It was awesome! Not sure the last time I was able to eat a breakfast pizza outside of my home.   Our kids (3 and 5) shared a kids meal dollar pancakes and there were left overs! They are not huge breakfast eaters but found a way to eat a dollar size pancake each.   My husband had one of the burritos and thought it was great!   This place will be on our list to eat at again!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! I had the vegan scramble and it was a ton of food and it was delicious. Everything I hoped for and more. Environment was great, service great, cleanliness excellent. It gets very crowded in the AM but because you order up front it doesn't take long. Loved this little place."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband on a whim and I'm so happy we did. I ordered the Toluca pizza and my husband had the steak and eggs. My pizza was out of this world I can't wait to go back and try another breakfast pizza! My husbands steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well the hash browns are also a must try. Can you please open up one on east valley because that would just be amazing!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! The food is amazing I tried the new chocolate chip pancakes with bananas, it was delicious! The place it's spotless and the staff it's very friendly I definitely recommend scramble :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Order food at the counter and it's brought out to you. Fresh and delicious. Decor is fun and perfect for the morning. I really like the beverage station as well. I wish I would have discovered this place in the beginning of my trip."}
{"text":"I was promptly and warmly greeted.  I ordered the Wich Came First.  The spices complimented the meal without over powering it.  The chicken was juicy and the egg was perfectly prepared.  As a customer traveling with a Service Dog, I also recommend this restaurant because of the friendly service Izzy received as well.  I highly recommend Scramble for anyone looking for a quick, convenient, delicious meal at a fair price!"}
{"text":"Nice people. Good service.   Food? Meh. It's okay. I think it's tough to do really killer breakfast food, especially in this area.   Maybe I'm biased from living in NorCal, or maybe I just ordered the wrong item, but it just didn't wow me.   Everyone working there was super cool. 5 Stars for service, for sure.    The eggs were meh. The meat lover's scramble felt like a Sysco mix. I just feel like there's more around the area that's better."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast after a climb along the Chollo Camelback Trail.  Nice bright modern decor.  A variety of breakfast items.  Prices are ok.  Split the Chicago breakfast pizza with my wife.  She thought it was tasty and I thought it was bland.  We both agreed it skimped on the sausage.  We tried a cranberry-orange scone - we've had better.  Our friends had egg dishes which they liked.  A confession:  I'm a sucker for any place that has a Dyson Airblade in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Thank you for donating an item to the auction for Girls On The Run!  I love your restaurant, its a great breakfast spot in Scottsdale.  I would recommend to anyone looking for some fresh, healthy options."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first visit here with the Living Social deal! Friendly staff and great place for families with young kids!"}
{"text":"Yeah, so this place is awesome. So many gluten free options as well as these cool hash brown things that taste amazing (I think they are called scrambled hash). Definitely the place for breakfast in Scottsdale. Only been here since January so there are probably more places to explore but right now, this is numero uno. The staff is fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"Scramble is a work in process, yet we believe the wait is worthwhile.  The counter staff have been trained quite well.  Says a lot about ownership in finding well meaning and bright people who really do care. After all, these people truly imprint one's 1st impression.  We are kind of special request consumers and the Scramblians have been up to the task.  Amanda is over the top gracious, caring and a wonderful staffer.  A REAL keeper. I believe the young and dapper gent with glasses (Conner?) is also up for the task.  A very good guy.  Menu is fun, creative and inspiring.  I believe the back of the house efforts could be fine tuned, yet this is that work in progress setting and we believe they will succeed mightily.  Stay your course Scramble."}
{"text":"I decided to get a quick bite to eat. Scramble is really close in proximity to where I live so I decided to get there. Got the Southwest burrito without cheese which was delicious! I want to try new things but the Southwest burrito gets me every time! Customer service was one of the best I've had among any restaurant. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food! Coffee is okay and service is different from traditional food. Very good french toast!"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. Highly recommend to anyone in the area.   Quick and friendly service. Very clean environment and a great food."}
{"text":"First of all, standing in a long line to order reading boards and then getting to the register and have people not remembering what they wanted, is not very functional or conducive to fast service. Maybe they should have a do it yourself check off menu. On a busy Saturday only having one register open is ridiculous. Maybe they want the line to be out the door to make it appear popular. I ordered the basic breakfast. Couldn't taste the rosemary in the hash browns. Eggs ok, but luke warm. Toast hard and unbuttered! Had to ask for butter. Not available at their self service station. Pancakes not hot. Butter wouldn't even melt on them. Artificial maple syrup. Prices high, service slow, noisy, food not hot and mediocre at best. Go to Butterfields or US Egg for sit down service and hot yummy food. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food at good prices A good place for us to go after church for a nice quick to light meal A good patio because our weather has been really great lately - one of the things I would like to see done differently is maybe the atmosphere be not so California beach and have a little more of a lunch restaurant breakfast restaurant feel to it The service is good and they go out of their way to take care of you in in a really casual inexpensive place but it almost is too much   I think they could get a little bit bigger clientele if they toned down the quick and easy in and out atmosphere and gave it a little bit more of a brunch feel to it  Not  sure how they can do that because they have it set up in a very casual way but there isn't much atmosphere or ambience there  It feels like a fast food place when you walk into it - you need to be ready for it and sometimes when we go out after church for breakfast I feel like I want to be in a little bit nicer place but we go there because of the food and the price is good so maybe that's all there is there  Good luck to them"}
{"text":"I found this place so disappointing especially based on the location. I had to go hunt for someone to tell me where the ice water was. And then the napkins. And then the coffee cup lid. Someone should have tipped me!"}
{"text":"Sooooo happy!! My husband and I used to live right next door to their first location and when we moved, I missed going there so much! And then they did it! They opened a second location near my new place. I was so excited to go here for their first opening weekend. Sat on the patio with my dogs and had the amazing Chicago Brizza (breakfast pizza) which is one of my favorite things. I love the atmosphere of this place, and the food is always great! Prices are good. The weekend we were there, the food was kinda slow to come out, but it was opening weekend so I'm giving them a break. I'm sure it will get better. Honestly I am so glad to have my favorite breakfast place back."}
{"text":"Quick breakfast, good coffee, open early, friendly service. Yep. This is the place. I walked here from the hilton and was glad I did."}
{"text":"To put it simply, I love this place! Great food, and very clean environment. After reading the other reviews, I'm not sure what the big deal is about ordering your food standing vs. sitting. If anything you're not sitting at the table waiting for a server to come by, and they do still service your table with a smile. My fave dish is the \"southwest burrito\" yum! The owner Clay is always involved and eager to make sure food goes out fresh and hot! And my favorite thing about scramble, is their dog friendly patio! It's hard enough to find a great breakfast joint let alone a dog friendly restaurant. Combine the 2 and you've got scramble...enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The service has always been attentive, accommodating and friendly.  The menu meets most dietary needs. I usually get the veggie omelette with egg whites. They offer gluten free toast which makes my day!  The food has always been very good and tasty. The iced tea is good as well as the coffee. They have milk, non fat milk, and soy milk on tap as well as sodas and lemonade.  The atmosphere is clean and bright. It's light and cheery inside. They offer a patio for outside dining and I think it may be pet friendly.  (I saw a dog out there)  I would recommend this place if you're in the area and looking for a good for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place seems HIGHLY overrated. I went there Sunday morning, it was pretty packed and there was a long line ahead of us when we arrived. Though i doubt it'll maintain that sort of traffic once everyone's tried it a first time and i don't see this place as having too many regulars once the hype of the grand opening blows over. Its also somewhat expensive $$$ (we paid $30 for 2 people) so if you're footing the bill for more than just yourself be prepared to pay a decent amount of money for not that much food, food which i didnt find to be all that great in the first place. I ordered a large coffee drink and failed to realize until after i had paid that it cost $6 just for that (pretty sure i pay less at Starbucks for a similar type of drink). Also we waited a good 20/25 minutes to get our food once we ordered. None of it was worth it.  Personally i wouldn't recommend this place, i definitely won't be going there again (shame too because its literally right across the street from where i love) its all hype and to pricey for me for a Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"This place has a little bit of everything for everyone. From a vegan to the hearty meat eater & everyone in between. The staff was super friendly & food was delicious! Wish they had one of these back home. You order as soon as you walk in, you sit down wherever you'd like, & wait for your food to come to your table. They also gave my daughter some wax sticks to get creative while she waited for her food! I like that it wasn't something like the typical for kids such as crayons which is still ok. The whole family got in that. Place was super lean!"}
{"text":"Who says a casual breakfast joint cant  be great! This place is awesome. Great service, food and pricepoint!"}
{"text":"I visited Scottsdale/Phoenix from San Diego and this was billed as Dog friendly BUT after ordering I was trying to fill the dog bowl provided...get coffee and head outside....An employee (girl) started lecturing me the dog needs to be outside (which I was trying to do) then outside there was NOT enough shade and it was HOT....The day before I ate breakfast at a Dog friendly restaurant in Phoenix and it was amazing from A to Z (Cafe Fa-me). The Phoenix location of Scramble may be better BUT I do not recommend this location!!!"}
{"text":"If I can give 3.5 stars I would. Walked in and the restaurant was basically empty. So I felt pretty skeptical trying out this place already... but the reviews here are great so I decided to stick around. When you walk in the menus are to the left and you order upfront and they give you a number and you can basically sit anywhere you like (personally I like that idea better than having a host seating me).   I order the western omelette and my friend order their original eggs benedict. First off, the omelette was just not that great... Eggs tasted a little over cook and processed. My food was not hot either. The eggs benedict was alright. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it all the time if I was a regular. Hash brown was good and crunchy. Toasts was very hard chewy...   I don't know what happen that day but I didn't like the food at all that day... I would definitely come back and try their other dishes but I probably won't come back for awhile.."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast spot! The food is great, the atmosphere is fun, and the more mimosas are delicious. I'll definitely come back here for more!"}
{"text":"My fiancé & I were excited to try this new spot out. Initially we were headed to another cafe but he suggested we stop somewhere closer to \"Well Suited\" so then I remembered this place. We walk in...mind you it's still relatively early for a weekend (9am) & we are sporting our new UA gear. It is after all (football season & we've got the fever). Now my fiancé did not go to a \"traditional\" rival-type university so the welcome needless to say was....LESS THEN JOYFUL!!  \"Oh you guys are trash\" is how we were greeted & what actually came out of the mouth of what might have been the \"manager\" -- he was wearing a black logo polo (possible give away).....We haven't even had our coffee yet.  My fiancé (being a spicey ITALIAN & again not having gone to a traditional rival type school was a bit bothered. I sat there & justified this mans behavior when in reality sometimes a greet or bash or whatever you want to call it could be poised differently. Perhaps, \"Good Morning GREAT GAME LAST YEAR...but this year you're going down\" or something other then \"OH YOURE TRASH\". At least let us have our coffee first lol"}
{"text":"Unprofessional establishment to say the least. Our catering order was cancelled yesterday and we received notification at 4:00 pm with no explanation. The order was to be delivered today at 8:15 am! Our attempt to branch out and support local businesses backfired tremendously. Important clients are in from out of town and the last minute mishap is not acceptable. Do not bother with this place, lack of customer service and attention to detail. First Watch in Tempe saved the day, go check them out!"}
{"text":"Great menu selection (love that they offered gluten free - and my friend loved the vegan scrambles). You walk up and place your order and they bring it out to you. The service was friendly and the food came out pretty quick. Super bright and lively atmosphere. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Really great breakfast spot. From traditional to creative menu options, healthy or indulgent. Quick, easy crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"So I went back and tried it one more time at the request of the owner. No more hard potatoes. They changed it to hash browns. Pretty good."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is exceptional. Everyone is so bright and cheery, just like the decor itself.   The food is fantastic. It's exactly what you want on a Sunday morning before football begins. They have a ton of options for all dietary needs such as vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, paleo, etc. I highly recommend their orange juice. It takes like a creamy orange. If you're really feeling it their screwdrivers are great as well. No shame.   I typically get the vegan burrito. Their flour tortillas are so fresh and light. It's a huge breakfast that doesn't make me want to crawl back into bed.   Tip- try the green chalula salsa that they have! It goes so well with the way they spice everything."}
{"text":"I would give this place less than one star if I could. I guess they are trying but come on..I was in Scottsdale I was expecting to have better quality food than that. I would have rather gone anywhere else than here honestly. When you tell someone to substitute egg for vegetables don't you think they'd just put more veggies? No since i substituted tofu for veggies instead they said they'd put way more avocado? Lol idk what sense that makes..but anyways they put like one little slice off half an avocado side..I could have ate a full avocado at home and felt more satisfied than the whole meal they gave me. It was tinier than you'd give a child. The whole burrito I mean. Just a waste of money. I left feeling unsatisfied with  my meal and like I didn't even eat at all. That same amount of money could have been spent at chipotle with a bowl..that would have been way better worth my money and I don't even like buying that lol..I just wouldn't go here if you're vegan at all. Don't even try it. Run away. Meat and chicken period eaters must love it for it to stay in business. Or maybe they just don't like vegans and gave me a shitty breakfast burrito lol"}
{"text":"This place is really nice, open and very modern looking, with clean lines.  I shared a prime rib panini with my husband and the cinnamon roll.  Both were delicious.  I don't eat beef very often, but when I do I expect it to be good.  This was excellent, I am actually craving one writing this review.  I saw other items being delivered that looked great.  The french toast looked so good and the hash browns seems so yummy  I almost ordered a side.  Our service was prompt and friendly.  It is a counter order kind of place.  I am sure I will be back for some more.  Parking in the area is tight if you are going to stay longer than 30 minutes.  I am not sure what they will do once other restaurants open.  I will try to go during off peak times."}
{"text":"Came in to get a coffee today. The caffe caramel is so good. It's not so bitter and not so sweet just perfect. I took it togo but it asked for a tip and I choose other cause I didn't want to tip and it charged $2. That was weird. Also they have a lot of tables inside and they have a couple of tvs. They also have a patio to sit outside. They only have one bathroom but it's clean and big. Definitely will be back to try their food."}
{"text":"I love Scramble for breakfast more than any other place in the valley.  If I have to recommend any item there - get their Scramble Browns instead of hash browns.  It is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place must be pretty new, I get to Phoenix twice a year and always look for new places, It is super clean and vert smartly designed, Staff are really nice, I came in on a Monday morning so not a whole lot of pressure on the staff. I had the chirizo burrito, very tasty and a nice size portion of potatos, as well as salsa and sour cream. I will come again and try some other items"}
{"text":"The best meal in Phoenix/Scottsdale is breakfast!  From service and food to cleanliness, this wonderful, modern breakfast/brunch/espresso place is off the scale.  Lottie was our super nice and caring server; people like this just make you want you to come back.  The food is absolutely delicious and they get espresso and coffee drinks perfectly.  Get the French French Toast and Southwest Benedict - amazing!  Cleanliness is wonderful; I don't think I've ever included a review of a bathroom at a restaurant, and this place is amazingly clean.  Add a nice wraparound, pet friendly patio and you have a place that will wish they did food all day long :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Just wish it wasn't so far from home.   I had the special pumpkin Apple pancake. Flavor was fabulous. Crisp bacon cooked just the way I requested.  The help is friendly and service is quick.  3 choices of coffee and you can do traditional coffee mate creamers but if you want healthier alternatives go around the corner and they have those too. A must try!"}
{"text":"I love this place not only for the excellent food but also the hospitality they offer on  the patio for customers with dogs is above and beyond. The food quality is excellent and the copious options for hot sauce will be sure to meet your needs.  My order, The Brizza! Gouda Pizza version comes with hand Tossed dough, Hollandaise, Scrambled eggs, Melted Gouda Cheese, and Applewood Bacon.   David helped us out at the front counter and was very helpful paying attention to detail while sporting a big smile.   Highly recommend this place to any foodie who's looking for a most mouth watering breakfast."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast cool ambiance outdoorsy nothing super great or super bad just a par as far as I am concerned. I had the meat scramble it was good but for 10$ could gotten a better deal from Denny's. Portion size wasn't what it should've been for the price. Daughter had the strawberry French toast she said it was just ok also. We have Had many great meals in Scottsdale. If you need a quick breakfast and don't mind spending $34 for an ok breakfast -a 2 egg breakfast, skinny meat scramble, and sub-par strawberry French toast go for it. Not my favorite breakfast."}
{"text":"Cameron was great very friendly place good coffee and food. They even split an order of chocolate chip pancakes for the kids without charge"}
{"text":"Meh. I really want to like this place. But there's just something about it that's not quite right. I don't know why there is all these 5 star reviews. Are you guys not eating at the right places? Or are you wanting to like it because it''s nearby? Ahhhh.. maybe things are quid pro quo? I love the concept. Kinda of self service, kinda not. I enjoyed the ambiance.  Organic/Fresh ingredients. Im down. But there's just something missing... Maybe it's execution?  Maybe it's the food? Let me begin by telling my experience.  We arrived one early sunday morning, right when they open at 6am. We were one of the few customers there. We ordered the meat scramble and the wife had the bennie. They come out pretty rapidly.  That's cool. My wife's hot tea and coffee are yummy. But that's where it goes south. My wife's Bennie arrives somewhat cold, yet mine is piping hot.. timing issues with kitchen? Could be forgiven... if it was busy. But it' wasn't. 4 people plus us. Grand total=six. My scramble, ehhhh... it was okay. It's maybe a step above Denny's. My potatoes were soggy and greasy. Ugghhh.. rot gut all day.  Dan the guy who complained about uncooked eggs get's what I'm saying.  But in the ultra competitive Scottsdale Breakfast/Brunch scene, if you are NOT on your \"A\" game either in service or food quality, you're not going to survive. That's why we have such high turnover in restaurant spots.   Now before anyone calls me a hater. Read my reviews, I am an experienced foodie. We have dined at the best Scottsdale B-fast spots (Daily Dose, US Egg, Orange Table (R.I.P), Breakfast Club, R&R, etc) and somehow this place doesn't cut it. Maybe the manager better find some new cooks or change the menu.. cause it's people like me with disposable income and time to kill who can afford to dine here regularly... and frankly, im not really impressed."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast spot. I had the Huevos Rancheros, which were delicious. Not smothered in enchilada sauce like most places. I was a little disappointed at first that it came with chips instead of tortillas, but the crunch was a nice addition. Even though you order up front then sit down (in which most places you never hear from anyone after you get your food) the girls here are on top of their game and checked in with me half way through my meal. If I lived here I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great way to start the day. Veggie omelette was excellent, service was prompt and very kind.  Would be here every week if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable place, comfortable but not luxurious, with good service. We had a couple of unusual choices, the vegan spinach and mushroom scramble with sweet potato hash browns, and a breakfast pizza. Both were surprisingly good. I suggest trying items you haven't had before, although our friend said her eggs benedict (a more typical choice) was excellent, too. Our only complaint is that since there are no \"soft\" finishes (like carpet, drapes, acoustic ceilings) the place gets a bit loud when it's busy."}
{"text":"You're average breakfast spot. It's a quick eating stop. I have the cali omelet but the burritos are all very good."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! The service was very fast, we had our food in less than 10 minutes from ordering. The patio allows dogs which was great for us since we are traveling with one. Our omelets and hash browns were amazing. Definitely will visit again on a future trip."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! They gave muffin samples out, the staff was incredible, the team work was great, the manger stopped and asked how the food was. The smoothie was my favorite, and I think it's cool that they offer gluten free, vegan friend and vegetarian options!!! That's awesome  I wish I didn't live in Mesa cuz Ild so go here more often!!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday morning for breakfast, wasn't quite sure about the ordering process.  Menu on the wall, walk up, order, pay & seat yourself.   Staff was excellent, explained everything and we helped ourselves to coffee.  Place was very clean and had a wide variety of people.   Our food came out quickly, looked good, everything was cooked to order and tasted great.   I didn't really like the hash browns, but the bacon was amazing!    Staff came by to check on us a few times. All in all it was a good experience.  I would go back again.  Keep up the good work Scramble!"}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast spot that was close to our hotel when staying in Scottsdale. Nice patio with outside seating in sun or shade. Not situated in the most happening area in the city if you're looking for more of a lively scene.   Ok now to eats. I'm a coffee snob and here you get below average drip coffee. To compliment our coffee we got their special - a warm blueberry muffin which was pretty delicious. Citrus glaze on top with fresh blueberries in the middle, plus some blueberry jam... yum yum! We kept it simple with breakfast items - eggs, hash browns, toast and sausage. Can't go wrong with that, pretty good! Hash browns were super greasy but crunchy on top, that's what makes it taste good I guess! I kinda wish I ordered the pancakes. Was eyeing the table next to me and the looked fluffy and scrumptious. On my next visit!   Overall nice, casual spot for a decent breakfast. You'll order what you want at the counter, sit where you want, inside or out, and they'll bring your food to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Scramble is a nice looking place but I was not a huge fan of the order-at-the-counter dealio. I did enjoy the vast array of mix-ins available for the coffee, as well as the impressive selection of hot sauces. My main complaint was the noise level. It's just too loud in there. People came around several times to ask how we were doing, which was nice/friendly but all the interruptions combined with the ambient noise just did not make for a relaxing morning meal.   Food-wise, there were lots of great-sounding options, including multiple items for vegetarians and vegans. Deciding what to order was not easy. I enjoyed my veggie burrito - with tofu scramble instead of eggs just because - and breakfast potatoes. The sweet potato hash was not available when I was there (sad) so maybe I'll have to go back to try that. However, although I liked being able to just hop up and get more coffee, more water, hot sauce, etc., it's also nice to be waited on.   I probably won't be scrambling to get back there."}
{"text":"Super cute breakfast joint. My boyfriend and I have recently moved out to this area and were looking for a place to get a yummy meal and this place hit the spot. Loved their coffee as well and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The counter-order Breakfast concept is pretty awesome.  One of two locations in the mid-section of the Valley.  Wasn't really sure of what to expect but I liked the prices posted on their online menu and when you're out of food but wanting a muscle-building breakfast this is a solid spot.  The parking lot was packed but when you find yourself inside there's plenty of space with the addition of the patio seating as well.  For $2.89 you have bottomless coffee: an Italian and Breakfast Roast.  Heinz apparently makes honey.    I ordered the steak and eggs, this is where I have some problems though.  Although the price for the dish is excellent and they should keep it right there with the perfect portion.  The NY Strip was probably one of the worst seasoned steaks I've ever eaten in my life.  So y'all need to put in some work on that.  Two fluffy eggs, perfect hashbrowns, and a English muffin to round it out.  My girlfriend went on to order the Phoenix omelette and my oh my was that delicious, I could only be jealous of her choice that was chock full of flavor versus my un-flavorful steak.  The sour dough bread is also delightful.  Definitely a fun choice for breakfast, especially if they get after it and season that steak."}
{"text":"Tried Scramble for lunch with 3 kids. Excellent choices for breakfast and brunch, some usual suspects but a lot of varied/new style options. Location catered very well to the kids and they enjoyed their chocolate pancakes with hash browns. Service was quick for weekday lunch and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio because we had our dogs with us. However their umbrellas were broken and it seems they could not move one closer to our table. We tried to do it ourselves and were told not to because the umbrellas were broken . They would not even consider moving an umbrella closer to us as we asked politely . They said the other customers would be bothered if they did . We sat in the very hot sun with our dogs and had a miserable experience. They were not accommodating at all.   Either have enough umbrellas that are working or don't provide seating.   Also the food was ok not great and the price was high for what you got."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Scramble. It had a cool design and was just across the street from my house. I gave it a couple of shots but, the food is not that good. The southwest burrito is very bland. The eggs benedict were very unimpressive. The multi-grain pancakes were the best thing sampled off the menu but, I ordered those with chocolate chips and was charged two dollars to have 10 chocolate chips sprinkled over the top and nothing else in the batter."}
{"text":"Great food! Great ambiance! Ordered burrito, french toast and cinnamon roll...all were AMAZING! Quick service and fresh flavors, recommend and will return!"}
{"text":"Food quality was not great. Definitely better options in Scottsdale. Everything seemed a bit watered down compared to other brunch spots around town."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for a quick brunch on our way from the airport. They were open on thanksgiving day! The ambience is casual and pretty cozy for breakfast or brunch. They have some fun quotes written around on the walls.  We got the alma brizza and some eggs. The brizza sounded different so we wanted to try that. It's a thin crust pizza with some breakfast toppings on it. That's exactly how you get it. No extra taste or sauce added so you'll have to use the hot sauce. We also got the garden scramble which was tasted better. The waitress was quite friendly."}
{"text":"Scramble is our \"go to\" place on Saturdays.  One of us always has the western omelet while the other two have the kale and quinoa salad and we add chicken for some extra protein.  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  Another great thing about Scramble is.....you can have a bloody mary.  Those are also delicious.....Kameron, owner/manager, can make it spicy if you like that extra punch.  Everyone is always so friendly, the restaurant is immaculate, and we are welcomed back each time they see us.  Scramble is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  We are happy customers!  Patty, Ila and Cookie"}
{"text":"The southwest burrito was tasty, and I really like that you can sub the potato for berries... Not just fruit, berries!! They also have several different flavor of Cholula. Tea was good. Overall a great mea for a decent price. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Katie and Patrick are phenomenal, the place is family friendly, super clean and the best of all the food is espectacular !! All the way from Dallas I had to come back to this place it's just perfect !! Thank u"}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS AMAZING. Aside from the food, this place is SO adorable and relaxing! The patio is pet friendly so fur friends are welcome :)"}
{"text":"I think I had higher expectations coming into Scramble when I learned that they offer vegan options.  While not a religious follower of the vegan diet, I do like choosing those options when they are available. I ordered the vegan veggie scramble with a sweet potato patty and was still hungry after I finished my plate. The patty tasted burnt and not seasoned. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish, but for the price we paid for our plates, I would have thought it would be more filling or satisfying."}
{"text":"We were a party of four and everyone of us were very disappointed. For a place that specializes in breakfast the food was terrible. With a name like \"Scramble\" we thought fantastic this place should have great breakfast. Wrong! The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer. Our omelette's  were runny, we requested our toast to be buttered and it wasn't and we didn't know it was going to be cafeteria style eating.  Oh well you don't know until you try right?  I think some changes made could make it a good place to eat but they just don't have a niche for food that will WOW you!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come to Scramble for breakfast every Sunday. We absolutely love it here, he normally gets the Chicago brizza because it's the best thing on the menu! Everything is delicious, including their drinks. I swear they have the best dirty chai in town!"}
{"text":"You walk up to counter and order your meal from a wide selection.  They give you a number and you sit wherever.  Attentive devices and absolutely delicious food.  Meat lovers omelette.  Huevos rancheros.  Steak and eggs.  And I also had a bacon infused Bloody Mary.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great food with healthy selections, including Vegan choices.  Lunch, brunch or breakfast.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Five shining stars I have rate here for being highly impressed. The affordable menu for all types of taste buds is definitely a crowd pleaser. The menu has traditional options along with some nice tasty treats you won't find at other breakfast joints. Scramble opens early in the  morning serving breakfast to closing in the early afternoon for breakfast/lunch.  I dined in for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. The cinnamon was my main entree. If you have a sweet tooth then this roll will keep you satisfied. Served warm loaded with a sweet frosting that is smooth like butter drizzled down the roll that melts right into your mouth. I washed it down with a fresh squeezed OJ. I had a side of Turkey Bacon that you could tell was fresh. It was delicious. I ordered light this time but was ooooweeeing and eyeing my friends plates who had a wide variety of breakfast along with lunch options. No complaints at my table all were VERY happy. Now I got to figure out what I will try next.  Just some added bonuses I thought I should mention: Trendy environment Big Screen TV Self Service Soft Drinks CLEAN Establishment Friendly service with a smile by ALL employees Easy to read menus on a big screen"}
{"text":"This is a cute, clean place with a friendly staff. We tried the vegan scramble and soyrizo burrito. They were very tasty and I appreciate the vegan options. I do have to say that they use way to much oil. The tofu is greasy and drips with oil. Other than that it would have been perfect."}
{"text":"Good banana smoothies. The place was packed and we were still served in about 15min. I was impressed. Everything was fresh and hot. Breakfast sandwiches are good. I look forward to trying the breakfast pizzas next time."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!  Clean!  Friendly!  Spacious/trendy!  The food is IMO excellent and I would definitely come back, again!  Had the best experience starting out with a friendly greeting and excitement to serve by the front cashier!  I had the omelette along with a side of wholesome sausage links!  I had to restrain from gorging on the hash browns (trying to stay good on the keto-diet) but ended up failing because the crispy edges and potato's calling my name, ... DELICIOUS!!!!  Coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Scramble. My fiancé and I came here for breakfast on Saturday around 10:30am. The line was out the door (literally), but it only took about 20 minutes to get up to the register and order. We sat outside on the patio and our food took about 25-30 minutes. (Side note: I love that the patio is dog friendly too and they have water bowls available.)  My fiancé got the Morning Scramble and I got the Two Egg breakfast. Mine came with toast, hash browns, and bacon/sausage. The Morning Scramble was kind of spicy but it had a great taste to it as well. We also got a cinnamon roll to share and it was delicious! The staff was very friendly even though it was really busy. Prices are very reasonable too-- our total was $28. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Scramble is always a good experience, food is excellent, service is good, they check up to be sure plate was done as you wanted."}
{"text":"Scramble is a great local eatery. I have yet to visit the scottsdale location but have eaten many times at the 7th street location. They were even gracious enough to work with me on a fundraiser for the animals on their Wednesday night breakfast for dinner events. I think this is a local business everyone should support. Delicious, friendly and supportive to charities."}
{"text":"5/ 5 stars cause it was soooo yummy! I agree with their saying, \"Think global, eat local.\"  I had the Monterey scrammble and added avocados to it and my taste buds were more than satisfied. It was hard for me to choose this dish, seeing as there was many options of eggs and I wanted to try them all haha The atmosphere is trendy yet casual and laid back. The service was on point and super friendly! Definitely a place to bring the family or your group of friends for a delicious brunch :)"}
{"text":"I love all the menu options and ways they cater to healthy eating, however our order was burnt, bland, and took over 35 minutes for a quick serve place.  Best part is there homemade OJ. Pretty expensive for what it was. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was just OK for us. The staff was friendly. The place was modern and clean. We ordered takeout and got the Southwestern breakfast burrito. It was more of a loaded \"scrambled egg\" burrito. It barely had any chorizo and we had to constantly pick out huge clumps of scrambled egg...and for what we paid, we expected more chorizo in there!! I also ordered a side of bacon, and only got 2 burnt pieces for $3.69! WTF!! What a rip! We're used to ordering a side of bacon and at least get 3 or 4 decent pieces. I was so disappointed about this. We were visiting Scottsdale for our Anniversary, and this was our last meal before heading back to San Diego. Yelpers said otherwise about this place, but I was personally disappointed I chose this place as our last meal in Scottsdale. See my pics and receipt."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're vegan with some non-vegans looking to do brunch. They have typical egg dishes, but also have tofu scrambles. I got the spinach and mushroom tofu scramble. It was one of the better scrambles I've had, for sure. I also split the vegan French toast with my boyfriend. It was very tasty, especially with lots of maple syrup. My only complaint is that my boyfriend got dairy put in his food after asking for it without. The only reason we found this out is because he's allergic to dairy and it made him super sick for the next couple of days. It was a bummer too because it was brunch for his birthday. If it weren't for that, I'd give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!  The restaurant is very clean and the staff was great!  It is an order at the counter and they deliver to your table set up.  They have a coffee bar for you to make your perfect cup.  Lots of breakfast items to choose from.  I tried the meat livers scramble this time.  I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Great vegan options! I suggest the vegan burrito. Friendly staff. Ate breakfast here everyday during  vacation and will miss it when I go home."}
{"text":"More happy bellies for us on our first visit to Scramble.  I love the Tex Mex options at breakfast joints in Phoenix, which we don't really get at home in cold Canada.  I also liked the concept of ordering and paying at the till, grabbing a table and having my food brought out cafeteria style.  We were able to grab a spot on the patio and enjoy our breakfast in the sun.  I enjoyed a Tex Mex style benny - spicy hollandaise on jalapeno corn bread - YUM!  And my boyfriend enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros with more corn bread.  Yummy smoothies as well!"}
{"text":"The ambiance, set up, patio are all wonderful. It's very clean and the service has always been wonderful. The patio is dog friendly and they even give you disposable doggie water bowls. Depending on what you are looking for your opinion may differ on food. Iv become a breakfast foodie so have become more picky on quality ingredients . It's little things like homemade jams vs cheap Welches Jam packs or a nice artesian bread for toast, not using slices from Frys brand.  Maybe invest in a juicer..the front is lined with what you would think is freshly juiced OJ but it's juice from a gallon jug poured into cups. I appreciate the honesty that it wasn't  freshly juiced from the employee. If it's freshly juiced I'm getting one every time."}
{"text":"Shiny, adorable egg-themed restaurant with yummy fare at slightly inflated prices.  The place is super cute, with lots of cute touches. Order at the counter, then they bring your food.  The food is tasty but in smallish portions for the price. Aside from interesting sweet potato hash and vegan versions of lots of things, they have relatively unremarkable choices.   We'll probably be back to try a few other items."}
{"text":"Was not very impressed by the food here. Easily could have made this at home and the food came out pretty slowly. When I asked for an extra plate, I had to ask 3 different servers because I wasn't able to get it the first 2 tries. Food overall was fine but a pretty loud atmosphere and nothing incredibly impressive. Good for a quick breakfast! Not good for groups."}
{"text":"Loved this place. First time here and really liked it. Priced well and a decent amount of food too! Got the veggie omelette with rye toast. The sun dried tomatoes were amazing!! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I eat here minimum twice a month, the prices are fair and the food is always hot and prepared to perfection, but a lot of the younger people that work here are not sensitive to the line at the door. Today it was absolutely brutal the line stretched out the door, a young man at the POS counter was assisting a lady ordering for her family and she had a myriad of questions about the vegan menu and how things were prepared, nobody ever jumped on the second POS and it was almost A 10 minute wait. I am possibly a little critical, but my expectations are high and I'm sure that's why they have a second register!"}
{"text":"Found out about this place thanks to yelp as I was looking for a breakfast joint with non-dairy options for delicious food.  The menu had what I was looking for and the prices were right so we decided to check it out early this Thursday morning.  There was no wait and they answered my questions easily.  Instead of soy milk, they had almond milk as cream for my coffee which I have not found anywhere else thus far.  BIG BONUS.  I ordered the vegan french toast since others had said it was worth trying with a side of sausage patties after asking if any whey or eggs were involved and being told that they were not. The food was heavenly.  Fiance got the mushroom and spinach egg scramble and was satisfied.  I was beyond impressed.  This will be my new go-to place for breakfasty type meals."}
{"text":"Nice food, and a cool atmosphere! It was a little busy when we were there, but the staff was attentive, and I like that you can refill your drinks yourself at the drink station."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast one day; awesome self-serve coffee and the breakfast sandwich was hot, fresh and soo amazingly delicious (ample portions as well).  It's a casual yet classy order over the counter type place; I've returned twice since my initial visit and will definitely be back again. The prices are not the cheapest, but for the quality it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu.  Overall, everything was very good.  Healthy portions and quick service.  Gringo burrito was good.  Small complaint, but fruit is mostly honeydew--ugh!  Coffee was fine and I appreciated the various milks and creamers.  Hot tea was great."}
{"text":"For Gluten free, this is great. Food is excellent, and they take gluten free seriously. I just wish it was table service."}
{"text":"First time at Scramble this morning. Sat on the great patio and had a wonderful breakfast with my husband and son.  Can't wait to pay them another visit."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, clean, modern atmosphere. Some may feel the price point is a tad high for some of the portions you get. However, the quality of the food is worth the price. A solid, quickly prepared breakfast! Will definitely go back and try some more of their menu.  I had one of the \"breakfast pizzas,\" the Toluca brizza, very tasty! Great multigrain pancakes. Fresh OJ, good coffee.  It's a partial service sort of set up. You order at a counter, you get your own drinks, then they serve your food to you wherever you choose to sit.  Do you tip at a place like this?"}
{"text":"Breakfast + pizza = brizza   !!!  How have I missed this all these years? Why did it take a trip to AZ to find this genius idea? Everyone serves breakfast and it's pretty much all the same. Take those same ingredients and put it on a pizza and it's like having your late night drunk snack for your breakfast hangover.   It's a huge serving. I eat like a fat kid and highly recommend sharing it."}
{"text":"Breakfast pizza, \"brizza\", Chicago,  very filling, but tasty, enough to share and to eat for lunch. Biscuits and gravy, brown gravy, yum. Unlimited coffee, 3 varieties. Order first and then sit down with your number, food comes out very quickly. Would give 5 stars, but prices are kind of on the high side for breakfast. Overall great place."}
{"text":"back again, because i know i can order more than just the pancakes that left a bad taste in my mouth last time.   opted for the veggie omelette this time to be safe. plenty of neatly chopped veggies flowed from the light and fluffy egg omelette. the side of hashbrowns was cooked to crispiness, and not too oily. perfect. i loved the rye bread. you have jam/jelly options from the island in the middle of the restaurant.   i did have an AZ bloody mary...just a simple bloody mary. it was flavorful and tasty. and with a Yelp check in and small donation, you get one of their giant cinnamon rolls....which i did eat. even though i'm technically on a low carb diet....but it was worth it!  service was super friendly and helpful. 2 out of 3 visits ain't bad!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worthy of more than 3.5 stars!! We went for the first time today and I loved it. The set up is great and the staff has it down pact, it's order at the counter which I appreciate for a breakfast place in Scottsdale- eliminates insane wait times and makes everything a little easier. The staff was super friendly and helpful with the menu since we were first timers.   Free coffee when you check in on yelp! My boyfriend had the Brizza (breakfast pizza) -the Teludo is what it's called I think. It was delicious, the crust was perfect and it wasn't too heavy for the morning. Biscuits and gravy were great too! They have a full bar and the patio is dog friendly  --- check it out, you wont regret it. I'm hoping one of these will be on every corner in 5 years ;)  Worth mentioning that they also have wine and paint nights and cooking classes!! How fun!"}
{"text":"Had the vegan veggie scramble. Let's just say it left a lot to be desired. Just a bunch of cubed tofu and a couple of tasteless veggies . The sweet potato hash, non descriptive . Won't redo ."}
{"text":"Very good food, clean, fast and friendly! Will go again tomorrow! Traveling, would love to have this place in my town!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, fast and delicious.  Will return.  Clean modern design place.   I had the gouda Brizza, Delicious! What's a brizza? Breakfast pizza yum!"}
{"text":"A second review is needed. We love the easy and quickness of ordering here. Lovin the free coffee check in. Healthy feedback to keep this place awesome: fruit can be more diverse.(only served cantaloupe) and the hash browns more crispy/ browned. Great staff always friendly. Thanks scramble!"}
{"text":"Clean, bright and sunny  The Chile verde burrito was spot on with the right amount of spice great flavor!  I tried my wife's vegan mushroom and spinach scramble,  I am not a fan of tofu but I would definitely eat this dish. Amazing flavor  This was a great find."}
{"text":"What can I say?  We tried this place twice.  First time they put turkey bacon in a strictly-requested vegetarian omelette and they said: \"It's only a little,\" but they did replace it. Another order on same visit had missing items. They made that right, too and gave us a card for a free entree.  All front staff were very courteous. Thumbs up on that.  Second time: Pancakes runny and uncooked on inside. They also made this right.  It seems like the kitchen can't get it together but the managers were very nice and I appreciate that.  Don't think we will return though as the food just isn't done right."}
{"text":"This place rocks, simply because it checks off all my \"must haves\" to make a great breakfast: soy lattes, egg whites, and turkey bacon!   Seems simple, however you'll be amazed at how uncommon it is to find turkey bacon in a world filled with a bacon obsession!   It's a little bit of a different dining format, but seems to work pretty well. You enter through the doors and are greeted with sleek screens that display the menu, as you wait in line to order from the counter. Once you order, you're given a table number and your beverage then off to pick an open table (note: it will be busy anytime before 2pm on the weekend, much like everyone else in this city), but I've never not been able to find a table. Chairs are a little uncomfortable... You know... That trendy, aluminum, \"repurposed/green\" lawn chair type of chair. Nothing that will ruin breakfast, just leave with with some super awesome indents in your legs for a good 15 minutes.   There are a good amount of TVs in the place, and they usually have some sort of game playing -- they are soccer friendly -- so you can watch some champions league while chowing down.  Dishes I recommend: Gringo Burrito, French Toast, and the Huevos Rancheros, and of course, a soy latte ;)"}
{"text":"Perfect casual brunch joint. I got a drink and an omelette, parked with my laptop and got some work done. Staff is really friendly and attentive, food is great."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in Scramble for breakfast today. I usually do not take the time to go on Yelp and write a review but I had to this time as this place is expensive with terrible food/ service. We thought Scramble would be like Snooze for breakfast but wrong. Way over priced and sub par breakfast in ever-way...for 3 people almost $50 bucks...we could of gotten a better breakfast at iHop or Denny's for half the price. At least at Snooze you pay for the quality. Her are some example's ( seft service coffee $2.79, kids tiny bottle cholo milk $3.09, Western Omel $11.00, Meat Scramble $10.49 super tiny ) !   I would not recommend and would NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"My star rating has stayed the same since my last visit here. Visited for the second time today and my goal was to try something more exciting off them menu. I am a tofu fangirl so decided I wanted to go for a vegan dish so I ordered a Vegan Soyrizo Burrito. It was quickly brought to our table. Was not to aesthetically pleasing, but I did not want to judge my food like that! Unfortunately my looks were not deceiving me and that was the nastiest bite of a burrito I have ever experienced. It was like pure flavorless mush with like 2 pieces of avocado. And unfortunately the sweet potato hash was pretty unsatisfying as well.  My date urged me to go tell them my issue and I worked up the courage to tell them I needed to order something else haha. They were extremely kind and accommodating, didn't even charge me for the second meal I ordered. I got The Alma Brizza and it was much better. Still not amazing, a little too salty for some reason, but I did like it, was a unique dish. My date got the Meat Lovers Scramble and he seemed to enjoy it. So overall, food is meh, service and atmosphere is very good!"}
{"text":"The French toast!! It was great experience! I could barely finish my French toast along with the hash browns and the potato patty that is cheese and some bacon I believe. My twin daughters shared a dollar pancakes and inhaled the freshly squeezed! We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place gets good ratings.  The service is friendly and it's clean, but the food was flavorless!  I had one of the brizzas and couldn't taste the hollandaise or even the sausage.  My friend had the eggs Benedict and she agreed that the flavor was nonexistent.   We also had 2 bloody Mary's, the \"spicy\" rattlesnake version. They tasted like straight V8."}
{"text":"Always fast, friendly service, and the food is wonderful too!! I love when restaurants cater to every dietary restriction, since I'm vegan but it's not always easy to get just anyone to come with me to a vegan restaurant.   Adding a few extra notes now- I had family in town this past weekend, including 2 little ones (ages 2y & 9mo) and I'm so glad I thought to bring them here! Everyone loved everything they ordered, and best of all, I got to eat a DELICIOUS vegan meal while my family enjoyed more standard-style breakfasts with all the non-vegan goodies they love.   * Kid friendly  * Vegan friendly (multiple options, too!!!) * Brunch  * Breakfast  * Fresh"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Black Eyed Peas - Let's Get It Started)  Everybody, everybody, let's get into it. Get Scramble Go to scramble, go to scramble, go to scramble. Let's go to Scramble(ha), let's go to Scramble and Yelp Let's go to Scramble(ha), let's go to Scramble and Yelp Let's go to Scramble(ha), let's go to Scramble and Yelp Let's go to Scramble(ha), let's go to Scramble and Yelp Yelp  Scramble is modern breakfast and brunch joint that will keep breakfast in your mind all day long!  I attended with a friend and was delighted by the atmosphere.  Light and bright with some buzz.  If I was tired from the morning; not anymore!  The place is hip and hopping, order in line and pick a seat kind of place.  I went with the Meat Lovers Scramble and cup of Americana coffee -- why don't they just call it a cup of Joe!  Anyways, they even have breakfast pizza here! Cowabunga!  That's definitely new and something I'll go for next time around.  My Meat Lovers was yummy, Applewood bacon, ham, sausage, and Monterey Jack cheese in a mesh of eggs and hash browns!  A running mans breakfast haha!  The bacon brought the saltiness, while the melted cheese supplied the sweet mush and the hash browns was a hit with the crunch.  Add some hot sauce and yippy!  Overall, great place for breakfast and brunch; plus it's down the street from where I live so that's always a plus in my books! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great service by very friendly staff.  It's not table service. Order your food first and they will bring your food. (I just remembered I forgot to tip them this morning... Sorry next time I will leave extra. I was sidetracked by rain)...  They have very neatly organized condiment station. They were so organized in a way, it was so perfect.  I forgot to get a few things and when I realized, staff went to get them for me with great smile.  I had traditional egg Benedict. They were what I anticipated to be, standard nothing overwhelming impressive but I was hungry and needed that heavy calories. A tad disappointed by hash browns. Felt as if they were frozen previously.  I also didn't like the chair. I was in my gym shorts and my skin against metal chair didn't feel good. They had cushy seat but I gave it up to my hiking partner. I almost thought about asking to switch the spot but oh well, next time I will wear long pants.  I really liked their service and nice and clean ambiance of this restaurant. Would come back at least once to try some other dishes, and next time I will leave the tip. I am really sorry that I forgot today."}
{"text":"I mean, their brizzas and coffee are worth the trip. The cinnamon rolls are HUGE and excellent, be sure to ask them to warm them up bc it's even better! The French toast is wonderful. In fact, I've never had a meal here I didn't like. I'm used to their location on 7th st but was in this location yesterday and stopped by with my mom and Doberman. Very dog friendly patio and the waitress even brought my girl a bowl of water. Food was fresh and hot when it was brought out. Even my mom commented that the coffee was the best she'd had in a long time."}
{"text":"Such a cool and unique breakfast spot! I love the modern look that it has along with indoor and outdoor seating. The spicy breakfast burrito I had was delicious."}
{"text":"I really liked my mid-week visit here for breakfast.  It wasn't busy at all and the service was fast and friendly.  I had the meat lovers scramble with hash browns and toast.  It was all very good and the hash browns in particular were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I visited Scramble for the first time this past weekend for Sunday Brunch and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it.  The atmosphere is very friendly, bright and happy with a great modern flare.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful which is a huge plus at a quick order kind of restaurant.  I love their menu options since they have so many vegan dishes and you can do anything with egg whites.  It feels like it could be a healthy breakfast option.  You order at the counter and then they bring your food in a few minutes.  **free coffee for yelp members who check in!!**  They have soy milk for the coffee and even flavored creamers too!  I could sit there all day and drink coffee with that selection.   For the food... I had egg whites scrambled with spinach, mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.  I subbed sweet potato hash for the hash browns which was a great choice.  The hash browns looked average and not worth the splurge.    I am excited to go back to try their lunch menu!  Kale salad, yum!!"}
{"text":"Went here for my first time and was blown away by the food, the customer service and atmosphere. We ordered a cinnamon bun, juevos rancheros, and the chorizo burrito with fruit. It was DELICIOUS! The burrito came out Hot and with all the fixings on the side. Tables were clean and offered many  seating areas. We will sedo tilt be back! Thanks for a great brunch!"}
{"text":"Thursday morning we went to scramble after a doctors appointment. My 3 year old and I cannot eat gluten so we were excited to see how many options there were for us. My daughter had scrambled eggs which she enjoyed. My husband had eggs Benedict and I had the gluten free version. We both enjoyed our meals. I have not had eggs Benedict in years so it was great to be able to have it. The only thing that could've made it better is if they would've used a gluten free English muffin instead of gluten free toast.  I will definitely go back next time I'm on that side of town in the morning."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and vegan-friendly.  Food isn't anything to write home about, but the price and location will have me coming back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday and they had a very helpful staff. The cook even offered a suggestion after passing by our table to scope out the crowd. Every staff member seemed very inviting and made the modern feel seem more normal than it original seemed. I had the Strawberry French Toast and my girlfriend had the French French Toast and must I say, they were delicious. After a morning whim of going wherever came on our phone first, my girlfriend chose a winner and we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"It's quick, it's fresh, it's convenient. It has indoor and outdoor seating and it's a casual pet-friendly place.  Order at the counter and grab a table.  Yes, these are all things I appreciate when I want a quick meal.         We had a couple of problems with our order (they forgot to put the egg in my TheFunGuy and they put turkey sausage in my husband's omelet instead of turkey) but they were very apologetic and made it up to us.   As for the food, TheFunMan was mainly bread, even if the missing egg had been there.  The side of fruit had a variety of items and was fresh.    The cinnamon bun was also fresh but not memorable."}
{"text":"When I first heard of Scramble it seemed like a fun place to have breakfast with plenty of options. Ordering at a counter is always nice so that you are less likely to be waiting for a table and a server, and the food was decent, but didn't stand out to where I'd want to go back. Strawberry French toast was pretty good, but not the usual French toast consistency you would expect. Considering it was strawberry, I thought it was a little weak on that aspect and the cream was just ok. My girlfriend ordered chocolate chip pancakes, which turned out kind of rubbery and hard to cut. Bacon was good, hash browns were good, but the main courses weren't the standouts that they should have been. But the restaurant had a few TVs, all with different channels for guests to enjoy and the atmosphere was pretty relaxed. There are just better breakfast options in the area that I would choose over scramble, so hard to give it anything better than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome local favorite. Great breakfast burritos and omelettes.  Extremely welcoming and professional staff. Try the Rattlesnake Bloody Mary. It is hot and spicy!  The Southwest Burrito was suggested by the staff. It was a great choice."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and amazing service! The food was off the chain and was so fresh. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Went about 10 AM on a Sunday with a $8 for $20 deal. It was busy, but we were at a table within 10 minutes.  You wait in line to order then they bring you your food. Free coffee and water while you wait. I ordered grain cakes & bacon plus sourdough toast. The toast was great, bacon was medium thickness and crisp. The pancakes were about 60% cooked, the rest not so much. I started slowing down after a waitress came by a couple times then I noticed the doneness.  I'm not the best a cooking pancakes and these were thick and had a good taste, so I'll give them a pass.  Plus I could have said something. Clean and friendly place, food is 3 stars because although good it wasn't enough to bring me back amongst the large selection of breakfast places."}
{"text":"Good food nothing WOW factor but good. Miserable a/c and it was so hot at 9am I couldn't enjoy my breakfast without sweating."}
{"text":"It's in my box of breakfast places. Tasty enough and I'm not feeling ill afterwards."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   I first heard about Scramble from Uber Eats when I was over at my friend, Whitney's house, and we wanted brunch, but were too lazy to go out.  I got their Huckleberry Stuffed French Toast delivered, which is stuffed with white chocolate cream cheese filling.  It was so outrageously great, I wanted to check out where the deliciousness came from, so the last time I was at Whitney's, I popped over to Scramble to check it out.   SCRAMBLE  Scramble is owned by Clay Moizo and Don Talbot of Icon Hospitality Group, which also runs Half Moon Sports Grill.  Scramble's concept is fresh, customer and community friendly local food, and they are proud members of Local Fresh Arizona.  Scramble serves a wide variety of original breakfast and lunch, and also offers a selection of vegan and gluten friendly options too.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE   Scramble is in a cool neighborhood, but I was not thrilled by their choice of strip malls. In fact, I thought so highly about what I had read about the place, that I passed it by the first time, thinking it would be more impressive.  Once inside, I totally got their vibe, but I kind of thought I was a little too old for the place at first, mostly because the décor was cafeteria-patio furniture-y and it reminded me of a college hangout.  The setup is order at the cashier, and they give you a number, and bring the food over when it's ready.  Although they bring out your food, there is a self-serve bar that has a lot of condiments and such. So, when she brought over my food, I asked for some things, and she pointed to the self-serve bar. It's self-serve, then waitress-y, then self-serve. I was up, then down, then up again.  The staff was super helpful, and very friendly.   I loved the Huckleberry Stuffed French Toast so much the first time from Uber them again, only this time with a mimosa. The food is SCRUMPTIOUS.  CONCLUSION  Scramble has great food in a casual semi-self-serve atmosphere. I'll definitely come back.  4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *There are 3 locations: Scottsdale, Phoenix, and Biltmore Area, with one coming in Chandler.  *Plenty of parking out front.  *For more information: azscramble.com"}
{"text":"Decent quick breakfast but not the best in town, I came this morning stepped behind the frosted glass cause I needed service and the manager was sitting on his cell phone. Then went directly back to the kitchen and worked without washing hands! Cell phones have so much bacteria on them and don't go well with scrambled eggs! (Yuck!) oh and the chairs... it's like seats you'd find in jail bring a cushion for you behind!"}
{"text":"Funny how age changes my outlook on eating. I used to think the portions at Scramble were small and this morning I failed to finish the breakfast I ordered. The service is above normal for a fast casual restaurant. My omelet was OK The hash browns were perfect, surprising how many fail to to fully cook them without making them totally too crunchy. My friends said they would not come again, while I would not rush back, I would not rule out coming again if asked."}
{"text":"Please  please bring Scramble to Tucson!!! First time here and it was fantastic. I LOVE breakfast food! I am on a plant based diet and my husband is gluten intolerant. My friend likes your traditional eggs and bacon breakfast. It's nice to go to a place where the food is fresh and everyone is happy to have something they can eat. It's nice not to worry about the staff being knowledgeable or not in what makes something plant based or gluten free."}
{"text":"The service is very impersonal...the servers bringing your food seem lost as they are literally looking for your table, the main girl at the front taking your order didn't know much about the food when I asked what the biggest thing they had was...her answer was \"I'm not sure\" , the actual tables are not very sturdy as I spilled my coffee several times because the table swayed side to side each time it was touched. Now as far as the food is concerned, the portions are not equivalent to the price you pay and the taste is very poor. Hash browns are over seasoned with pepper and the meatlovers hardly has any meat in it and is virtually tasteless. I would recommend the Breakfast club down the road in Scottsdale before i ever recommend this place. Overall this place is rated Very Poor in my Opinion."}
{"text":"Nothing special or exceptionally tasty food wise. And not much character to the place."}
{"text":"We went here on Mother's Day bc of course every other place had an hour wait at 8 am! With two toddlers going out to eat is not easy but this place was easy! It's a concept like Sauce which is easy, they have plenty of high chairs available and the staff was upper nice! My omelette was even pretty darn good for the price! I wish they would put one out in Mesa!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I'm updating my review based on my last few visits. The service at scramble is definitely starting to slip.  The last few orders that I picked up, no one was there to check me out and I eventually had to just flag someone down, interrupt the other people trying to order so that I could pick up my to go order. I was not greeted, nor did anyone ask what I was standing there waiting for.   They now have online ordering which is great, but some kinks to work out.  I have yet to have that process go smoothly. The first time somehow part of what I ordered got  changed and they made something different.  The second time I had a typo in my billing address so my payment didn't  go through.  The online system requires you to put in a phone number so that they can contact you, yet when I arrived they told me that they do not get my phone number so they couldn't call me.  They pretty much blew me off during both of these errors and made no statement that they were going to attempt to improve the system, so that's a little bit troublesome.  The food is still great but service , not so much."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for brunch and paid $25 for two entrees and no drinks (free drip coffee when you check in). Atmosphere was cool and very clean. Staff was friendly, but portions were way too small. I ordered Huevos Rancheros and there was one chunk of chorizo meat. My wife had a scramble with gluten-free toast and there was a two dollar up charge for the gluten-free toast. Probably won't go back because of the price per portion!"}
{"text":"Cute place. Nice wide menu, decent prices and really great food. Huge portions!   Easy to find. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Coffee is terrible.  Starbucks pricing for Sheriff Joe bean water.  Cold, watery and total ripoff."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Scottsdale Plaza for a couple days prior to a work conference and after a rough Saturday night out til 2am but still on 4am NY time bar-hopping after front row seats to the Jim Jefferies Comedy show - I was looking for a brunchy spot to soak up the alcohol in my belly.  I stumbled up on Scramble being a quarter mile from the hotel and what a treat.  I got there at a time with only one person in front of me one line - I saw that quickly can change and by the time I sat down the line was to the door.  The cutest and friendliest of hostesses dealt with my \"traveling indecisiveness\" - see I love coming to places and not trying what I know I will like - since I pretty much like everything - but instead I like recommendations and things that the place is known for.  The young woman walked me through the menu and told me about their trademark breakfast pizza - the BRIZZA - known for absorbing alcohol in the belly.  But she had already sold me on a green Chile pork burrito so I was caught in my decision.  Easy enough - I came back the second day for the burrito and had two amazing meals.  Coffee was outstanding as well at this \"serve yourself\" center bar.  I love that they serve adult beverages like bloody Mary's and mimosas as well.  I highly recommend this place.  Food is served quickly and while not a traditional \"service at your table\" spot - the service is actually top notch and is what will distinguish this spot from it's peers in addition to their high quality brunch fare."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick, fresh, gluten friendly option and found Scramble!  Highly recommend! Delicious breakfast, fast, friendly service!  We will be back, often!"}
{"text":"I come her once a week and the food is fresh all the time. It's easy to order, great service. I would recommend the French toast if your looking for sweet."}
{"text":"Can I just say this place would be so great if they stepped up their coffee game?! Maybe I'm a snob but this food was SO GREAT! & then the black coffee I ordered was like water. Such a disappointment :(  Cute menu and restaurant set up, patio was delightful in the lovely PHX \"winter\", but guys... You are a breakfast place. Get yourself some good local roasted beans and become a 6 star b-fast joint overnight!"}
{"text":"My daughter had the vegan scramble and it was delicious! The options for vegans were great too. I had an omelette which was good but not as good as the vegan dish. The hash browns were fantastic! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time Thanksgiving morning.   Great food friendly staff.   Busy place and fun atmosphere.  Many items on the menu I want to try.   Meat lovers scramble outstanding.  Mimosa could be more generous next time I will have two!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance! You walk in, order and take a seat and your food will be brought to you.  My husband and I are here for a conference so we just used Yelp to see what we could find and this popped up! Definitely not disappointed. He had the Huevos Ranchero and loved it!! I had the typical eggs, toast and hashbrowns and it was fabulous! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good thing I don't live here because I would never be back if I did. I was on a time crunch... no one was in line so I ordered. Waited for over 25 minutes with no food insight. One of the workers admitted they took the meal I paid for to the wrong table. Proceeded to leave and just asked for my money back - including the tip. They couldn't figure out how to even give me a refund for the food I paid for. Just happy I can dispute with amex! If you have all the time in the world this may be a great place."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Was on vacation with my vegan son and they have  a large variety of fun vegan items to chose from that are creative and great tasting. He loved the sweet potato hash and the vegan chorizo.  I had the heuvos rancheros and they were delicious.  Seasoned black beans and crunchy chips. Even their coffee drinks were delicious. A must see visit!!"}
{"text":"Tradition Eggs Benedict was the best I've ever had! And the cinnamon rolls are so good! Big enough for two people! This is not a dine in/ service restaurant, you order over the counter, they give you a number, and you sit wherever is available. Food comes out quick!  Prices are a little on the expensive side for an over the counter experience and they leave a \"tip\" option on your receipt even though there is no waiter or waitress. But overall, a great place to eat for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Back to back days at Scramble. First of all they have a scramble board at Scramble.  I had the French French Toast. Delicious. The staff was friendly and even let me take a picture of his shirt. I agree with their motto, you can never be too fresh. And the Orange juice was good too! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Good place for a fast casual brunch with a nice sit down setting. The place is very welcoming and fresh. There is a self serve condiment area which is very cool. Overall the food was great! Definitely would come back when visiting Arizona."}
{"text":"Fast and quick service... Easy ordering and efficient place was packed but plenty of room to sit. Nice patio seating area. Food was good and would recommend coming back if your in the area. Pet friendly..menu has both breakfast and lunch available.. Fresh coffee and juice.... Tons of selections of coffee blends.."}
{"text":"It's very easy to make chorizo and to put little to non on my plate when the main course is chorizo is nothing short of a rip off and unacceptable. To charge ten bucks for two eggs on top of tortilla chips is just lazy and overpriced. I ate here yesterday and was very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast place with good food and friendly service. Great menu from simple (eggs, hasbrowns and toast) to creative (breakfast pizza). Something for every breakfast lover. Coffee bar has everything you need. Messed up my order but fixed it and took it off my bill without me saying a word. Nice. Glad to have this cute place in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I was so happy when I saw the large sign asking how you would like your eggs cooked. There was the exact description of over med eggs!I get tired of ordering over medium and getting over easy, like they are the same thing. I ordered eggs Benedict with a fried, over med egg but unfortunately i got an over easy egg. Ugh..just ate it (it was good)but would've prefered it the way I ordered it.. Staff was great and I will go again"}
{"text":"Very delicious! I love that they have vegan options! I had a tofu scramble and my husband had steak and eggs. The place was busy but that's because it was yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm vegan and haven't had French toast in over a year. I got the vegan French French toast and loved it. The workers were friendly and helpful. Very clean place good atmosphere. My group also liked their meals. I would love to go back and it would be awesome if there was one in Tucson."}
{"text":"Really liked it. Good food cooked just right, clean environment,  nice employees! Yes, the coffee is good too."}
{"text":"Wanted to change it up a bit and tried Scramble. So for a casual, do-it-yourself kinda place, this joint is a-ok! Very friendly and inviting service upon arrival. Be prepared for a cafeteria vibe. Order as you walk in and sit and wait for food. Very economically priced. I ordered the Phoenix omelette...it was ok. Chirizo was a bit grizzly and it was a bit scarce of cheese. My friend ordered the oatmeal and it looked good and she confirmed that it was, with pecans, raisins and brien sugar. The chairs were aluminum and not very comfortable. Very nice and bright and very breezy and cool...lots of doors. The cherry/acacia tea was the bomb! Went back maybe 47x lol...not really, but large, plastics cups were very small and I had to lol For the most part, cool, casual place. Might try again, alone, but not Place that invited for me to stay and enjoy."}
{"text":"We got the Chicago breakfast pizza and it was a good dish haven't seen it anywhere else. The strawberry French toast was also pretty good. The best part was we were seated immediately!"}
{"text":"The food was just okay NOTHING special.  There's so many other great breakfast places to eat in Arizona!  Don't waste your money here especially since you will pay the same amount as you would at a full service restaurant.  The idea of waiting in line to order food and having to get your own coffee is not appealing.  It makes the breakfast seem even more over priced than it already is!  DON'T GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"First off, this place prides itself on friendly service and the girl that took out order was anything but. No smile, nothing warm about her personality. We ordered the veggie omelet and there were hardly any veggies and the eggs were a little under cooked for my taste. The hasbrowns were warm at best, and rubbery. Speaking of rubbery, the berry pancakes were rubbery and tasted like box, over-whipped pancakes. The orange juice tasted great, as well as the berry smoothie. The atmosphere was contemporary and chic but didn't reflect in the food. We were disappointed."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and gave Scramble a try today. LOVE their menu- locally sourced food and produce, lots of vegan and vegetarian options, and Prices were reasonable. Food was yummy. Would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"This was our first outing as new parents. You wait in line and order like a fast food restaurant then they bring the food to the table. I ordered pancakes which were really good and my wife ordered a chorizo omelet. My 6 week old ordered a breast milk shake which he seemed happy with (I kid I kid, no breast milk shakes at this place). The food was good and we will be back. The only thing I don't like is waiting in line to order. I like when the server takes your order at the table. I did, however really enjoy the self serve coffee. Interesting mix of people eating there if people watching is your thing. Check it out."}
{"text":"What a fun, well designed concept.  I came in just before 10am on a weekday with my kids.  There was an impressive amount of people eating & we know why... This breakfast joint is solid. The veggie omelette was a good size for me, but may be a tad small for more aggressive eaters. The kids pancakes were super big... At 3.99 a great deal.   The food was a bit over saturated with butter from cooking, but I'm giving the kitchen staff a break with 4 stars as I know they will hit their rhythm soon and this place will be packed. With decent parking and a cool modern vibe I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I was visiting family and looked on Yelp to see where we should grab breakfast. We all have different dietary preferences (vegan, vegetarian, gluten free) and Scramble had options for everyone. I had the eggs benedict and it was amazing! Scramble did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"lots of great options at a reasonable price with fast, friendly service. Make sure you tip them - they bring your food and clean up after you!  I usually order one of the scrambles, perhaps the meat lover or the morning, and I always substitute the bread for the dollar pancakes... they have great coffee too. Be sure to come early, they get busy on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Recently tried this business for breakfast. I have to admit, I wanted to just walk in and find a booth, have someone bring me coffee and take my order. Did not like the stand at the counter and order and seat myself, but.....THE FOOD WAS AMAZING."}
{"text":"Love coming here for a delicious breakfast with my boyfriend. They very patient and careful with my food allergies, and I've never had a problem with incorrectly made food. My favorite thing is the \"Vegan Mushroom & Spinach Scramble.\""}
{"text":"Great place to go for a quick breakfast.  It's set up like Pei Wei, so easy to order and find a seat.  Food was really good and came out fast!  I'd recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here and I was happy to see they are part of Yelp Check-In For Children.  The food, service and atmosphere were all very good.  The menu had a lot of variety and the prices are affordable.    If you are looking for a good breakfast place then I suggest Scramble.   I suggest the French Toast!"}
{"text":"Didn't think pancakes could be so soggy until I went to this \"restaurant\". Food was awful and service was sub-par. Would NOT recommend, even to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Yet another great break-y place to add to my Favorites.   Scramble is jammin' on the weekends, so be prepared for a wait. But, this gives you ample time to study their menu to place your order at front counter. They do offer inside or patio seating.  Decor is bright and cheery - my kind of place. Was also very tidy and hygienic - props to them as they were BUSY!  My ham and mushroom omelette was great! Was so full, that I didn't have chance to eat my hasbrowns.   Yelpers: check in to get your FREE coffee!"}
{"text":"Meh. Pretty basic. I know I can get way better quality and flavor for less buck other places. Asked for avocado instead of ham in the western omelette -girl says it will be .99 extra, I say ok can we sub it for ham? She says it will still be .99- ok whatever. I get my omelette- no avocado and so I ask for some on the side since it's not in my omelette... to the same girl, she says oh you asked for ham to be subbed- I'm like what? It already comes with ham, and I was charged for extra ham. Makes no sense, I did get my avocado for no charge but was charged 2.40 for extra ham.... -____- oh and the \"caramelized onions\" are definitely not caramelized, just ordinary onions. I get the cool appeal and it has options for vegans but I won't be back here."}
{"text":"I've eaten there twice and the food was delicious both times.  Nice to be able to have a cocktail that's not just champagne with my breakfast/brunch. The staff were really nice and helpful. We had our dog rescue fundraiser there both times and they could have really given us a hard time.  But instead they move tables for auction items, encourage donations and overall are wonderful.  AND THE FOOD IS GREAT!"}
{"text":"The scramble is still on point with customer service, excellent food and helpful staff. 4 stars highly recommend you try."}
{"text":"While searching for breakfast in Scottsdale we found this place and turned out great. Kind of a different concept on where you order at the counter and they bring out your meals. I had the  Huevos Rancheros and was great. Wifey had the Breakfast Sandwich. Everything was great, would recommend."}
{"text":"Food is great here. Love the jalapeño corn bread! Their food isn't the typical greasy eggs you get at other places. It's healthy breakfast"}
{"text":"Great service...delish French toast...cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Just as yelp states 3 stars mean- this place is A-OK. Not too much to complain about other than the fact that it's nothing spectacular. I got the veggie omelette which I liked, hash browns were good. It was breakfast and it filled me up and it wasn't bad so that's A-OK by my book.   If you're looking for a quick easy meal which is not too expensive, this is definitely a good choice. Looking for a leisurely and amazingly delicious brunch, prob not the right place.   Every restaurant has a niche and they are filling convenient, healthy, friendly very well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go-to breakfast joints. Excellent food and service. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Clean environment.  Was a little disappointed it didn't have more of a relaxing feel. Felt more like qdoba for breakfast"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast stop today for our 5 group. New modern build place but...gotta love it anyway. Will surely return. Great food choices here of many."}
{"text":"Tried Scramble for the first time and all I can say is YAY! What a fun, welcoming brunch spot! No table service. You order at the counter, seat yourself, and food is delivered when it's ready by truly excellent (and caring!) staff. They make sure your food is right and you're happy with everything. No false pretenses here. Just plain good food, and a great ambiance.   Super diverse crowd and really kid-friendly. They hand out WikiSticks to young patrons to keep them interested and occupied while you wait. No need to hand that kid a phone or iPad here!  When we came to eat, there was a soccer family at one table, a group of bikers at another, several young families with foodie kids, and a couple of twosomes just there to enjoy a good meal. I loved the eclectic mix of people!  The huevos rancheros was delish. So fresh and a great combination of flavors without any one element overpowering the dish. We also enjoyed a Southwest Burrito which was tasty and like a party in your mouth with only the freshest ingredients invited!  Just go. Trust me."}
{"text":"Just ate at Scramble and had a poor and terrible experience. If your looking for a better experience you are better off going to McDonalds. The food is a poor quality. For example, we ordered a Cinnamon Bun that came with a glob of icing-- poor presentation.  The employees said the orange juice is freshly squeezed however it  was not!! The eggs also tasted like rubber.  My recommendation is to avoid this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"came here for breakfast on a Friday.  I ordered the huckleberry stuffed French toast because I love white chocolate and cream cheese and it comes with a white chocolate cream cheese filling and it didn't disappoint. I would order this over and over. they also have gluten free so my daughter was able to get something good which sometimes is a pain for her."}
{"text":"It's dog friendly, but you can't bring your dog in to order. I recommend bringing a friend if you have a dog, and just both ordering separately. The food was a little pricey, but it's Scottsdale. What are you gonna do? Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered a few items from Scramble this morning for the office, and nothing was neither egregious nor great about any of our orders.  I ordered the California Omelette (with turkey bacon, kale, jack cheese and topped with avocado) and it was just ok.  I struggled to find the cheese, and the omelette itself was thin and a bit sad looking.  It wasn't bad, it was just.....meh.  My coworkers each ordered burritos and had the same sort of reaction.  The elements were all there; it just didn't hold up to anything.  One of them said they'd rather have a fast food burrito over the one they had here, and they both said they'd rather pass on Scramble in the future.    Not sure if we just came on an off morning, since other reviewers seem to have had better experiences, but if what we had this morning was the standard, then I'll take a pass on Scramble in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent quick serve with full menu, good food, and terrific friends service. We enjoyed the patio. My son especially recommends the hash browns. Noting fancy, just good, solid, if a little pricey breakfast."}
{"text":"A-OK is just what I'd call this.  It's a diner-ish feel but with a modern twist.  You do order at the counter, and I got there early enough to not have to wait in line, but eventually one formed.  I can see that as being an issue.    I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and a side of bacon. The bacon was crispy and delicious. The hyevos were good.  There was a need for a little more spice though. I do like the crispy tortillas that added a great texture.  My counterpart had the Cuban sandwich. This was a bad choice.  Perhaps I've been to Miami too many times, but this was lacking in mustard big time.  The pork was crumbly and kept falling out. Eh.    This is a no frills, yet modern joint and it serves it purpose for breakfast, which I rather enjoyed.  they also serve limited alcohol which is great and the cost is reasonable.    They offer a nice patio for nicer days than it is right now and there are TVs inside."}
{"text":"I love this breakfast place! Great vegan options! Try the vegan veggie scramble or the soyrizo burrito. Even the coffee is really good, and they have soy milk! I wish I could eat here every morning... the food's great, the environment is welcoming, the customer service is awesome!"}
{"text":"We live in the area of the Scramble Scottsdale location, so we decided that we wanted to support local business and tried it.  We ordered omelets, and we order omelets at various area restaurants.  I will have to say that for a three egg omelet it was the smallest that we have ever had anywhere.  So now, we wait on ourselves, get our own coffee, water, silverware, napkins, etc and we are served this omelet that must be made from robin's eggs, it is sooooo small!!  The hash browns were the greasiest mess of potatoes that I have every seen.  We asked for the toast to be buttered in the kitchen (one small bit of service, please!) and it came out of the kitchen with no butter on it, and frozen butter to try and spread on it.    The server explained to us that they do not used cracked eggs for their omelets and scrambled eggs, but buy it by the container - YUCK!  The place looks very clean.  However, while we were there two employees  came out of the kitchen (must be the cooks) and they were the filthiest human beings that I have seen except for someone holding signs along the freeway.  This was at 6:00AM!  I hate to think of how dirty they would be after they cooked all day.  Bottom line.............if you are going to try to compete with breakfast restaurants in Scottsdale and be self-service you'd better have a whopping good, breakfast with HUGE portions.  By the way, the smallest omelet (theirs!) is also the most expensive in Scottsdale.  And..............clean up your cooks before the Health Department makes you clean them up!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Phoenix location and was enamored with their eggs benedict, so I've been dying inside every time I passed by the sign for the new Scottsdale location on my way to work in anticipation of their opening! Husband, his cousin, and I stopped in this Sunday to see the new digs. There's much more seating, but there's still that wait line, which was peeking out the door at 10:30am. Once we got towards the front of the slow line, an employee informed us that, after we ordered, it would be an additional 30 minute wait for the food to come out (the place was pretty packed). Yikes! Good thing they have alcohol here!   We ordered our food and sat down. Soon after, a server came by with a bloody mary, mimosa, and my hot loose-leaf tea (the chai one with vanilla notes, one of my favorites that Kelly R. had introduced me to). While we had a bit to wait for our meal, the servers were very personable. It was a little longer than a half hour until our food finally came out, and we were starved! Husband was quickly obsessed with his Costa burrito, his cousin enjoyed his traditional eggs benedict (and who doesn't love those rosemary potatoes?), and my Southwest Burrito was okay, but wasn't as spicy and flavorful as I was hoping. Husband had also asked for a side of burnt bacon (the cashier even said \"We have a button for burnt!\" which was exciting!), but when it came out, it was just normal bacon. The server had no problem bringing it back to have the kitchen throw it back on the griddle, so we opted for that... but we had finished our meals before we realized that his bacon never came back. After flagging down a server again, it magically appeared and was still not fully burnt. Whatever. It's still bacon.  All in all, I'd give them 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4. Food is better than average and they have some great flavor combinations with fresh ingredients (definitely need to try one of those brizzas next time!!), service is stellar, but the kitchen seems a little scattered and slow."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend after a hike. I got the morning scramble and it was excellent. The hash browns were cooked perfectly and paired well with the morning scramble. I couldn't notice any of the chorizo, but it was still good none the less. Parking is a pain as there are not many spaces. There is only one bathroom for each gender and so it made it very inconvenient to go to the bathroom or wash my hands. The environment gets rather busy and can be somewhat loud. Pricing is a little on the high side in my opinion, $11 for my scramble."}
{"text":"Don't know how this place has so many stars, maybe for their good service. Sweet potato had was burnt and food presentation was horrible. Also did not expect the cafeteria style ordering."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast. They have it all figured out! Indoor and outdoor seating. I will be back next time in town."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place the first time as I don't remember it being here last year when I was here for spring training I didn't realize it was an order at the counter and then go sit down kind of place so of course have to give it one star for that.  Dang the portion size my God I can eat three of these plates have the owners  not gone around town and see what kind of breakfast you can get for the same price I'm really shocked in fact  on the way to the game I had to stop and get a sandwich I was still hungry.  The food taste was just \"ok\" too.   The place was clean the service was friendly but I don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"Think of it as an upscale fast food for breakfast.  The concept is similar to pei-wei, sauce, etc where you walk in and there's a menu, you order at the counter and then they bring the food to you after you sit down.  Service is very prompt and pleasant.  THey have many sauces to try out.  over all its nice place but not the typical sit down breakfast place that most are used to"}
{"text":"Overcooked scramble eggs, under fried hash browns. Bacon tasted decent. Sweet potatoe hash is badly seasoned. Friendly service. Mediocre food."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and we like their food. It's an order first and then find a table kind of place which seems to work well.  They have special hash browns that are really good but ask for them crispy to make them better."}
{"text":"The food wasn't good and the service was worse.  One person was nice, but that doesn't make up for everyone else.   The whites on my sunny side up eggs were completely uncooked.  I asked politely to have them cooked more and the waiter said that's how they're supposed to be and a lot of people just don't know that. I know how they're supposed to be cooked and they're not supposed to be completely translucent and jiggling. Still, I thought maybe I might have always had it wrong,  so I Googled it and every image concurred with me. I told him this and he told me that their menu says they cook it with runny whites. So I checked their menu and it says runny yolk (not whites). I have never sent anything back in my life  There were other things wrong too. But that gives you a good idea of what the meal was like."}
{"text":"What a cute restaurant! I came here for brunch with a group of friends and we picked this place due to its vegan menu to accommodate one of our group members. It was a different kind of eatery since you order and pay before you sit down, kind of like ordering at a fast food joint. The menu had many choices but was not overwhelming. I saw after I ordered they offer a breakfast pizza; I'd be interested in trying it next time. My food came out in a reasonable amount of time. It was good, nothing extraordinary. The rest of my group enjoyed their breakfast. You have to come early because at a certain time the parking lot becomes valet only. Again if be interested to try the breakfast pizza before I waive Scramble off. Good food but again nothing out of this world!"}
{"text":"Scramble is locally owned, and a fresh, delicious, fast casual concept.   Order at the counter, grab a number and wait for your food to be brought out.  Oh, and you can enjoy a Bloody Mary or Mimosa if it's that kind of day.  We dropped in for a quick breakfast on the way over to Shane Co. to check on my wedding bands.   Kept it simple and shared a Southwest Burrito ($10.49) with the avocado on the side and hold the jalapeño cream cheese.   This came with a side of hashbrowns, and we also got a side of Applewood Bacon ($3.69)   The eggs in the burrito were nice and fluffy and thankfully not overcooked, and the chorizo had a nice zing to it.   Quick, filling breakfast!   I would definitely drop back in for a bite again when in the area."}
{"text":"Was checking out events on the Yelp app late this morning when I spotted a \"Breakfast for Dinner\" SNIFF fundraiser event (5pm-8pm).  I had arrived 30 minutes too early, so I called John at Scramble to see if I'd have any trouble attending the event-- sometimes events like this require reservations, but he informed me that Scramble never accepts reservations, that \"that's the beauty of Scramble,\" it's first come, first serve.  I did notice people walking in before 5p, so I decided I'd go in, too.  I was told that the kitchen isn't quite ready, but that everyone there could have a look at the silent auction offerings.  There even was a 50/50 raffle, which I learned gave the winner (name drawn) half of the pot, and the other half goes to SNIFF.  I asked if food and beverage sales were included in the fundraising, and the answer was yes, yet no one knew the percentage of the profits (the Scramble board director didn't know, and the SNIFF rep she asked didn't know, either).  I hadn't planned on staying on till 8 pm, so I just stuck to what I went there for-- the food!  :)  I ordered a cappuccino ($2.99; the menu gave me a choice of hot or iced, but the cashier didn't ask me), a Southwestern burrito ($9.49), minus the avocado (allergy), and a side order of dollar pancakes ($2.69), plus additional toppings of chocolate chips (+$1) and blueberries (+$1.49).  The restaurant is designed so that beyond the entrance door is the line to order your food, with the menus posted along the wall where you wait your turn.  There are also menus posted outside the restaurant.  I didn't observe any more menus to look at, aside from these two locations-- there may be above the cashier, but I do not care to look at menus posted high up, so there could've been.  I looked for paper menus, and there weren't any.  The cappuccino was served in a paper cup, which slightly disappointed me, as I am all for dine-in presentations (ceramic cups/mugs) and coffee art. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scramble-scottsdale-2?select=9YYDk0jNH9gxY60RXNcTpA  I was surprised as to how \"empty\" the cup felt when I lifted it to take the lid off.  It looked like a 16 oz cup, but was mostly foam-- at least 50%.  The coffee beans are from a Tempe-based company, but they're roasted in-house.  The cashier pointed somewhere to her left and back of the restaurant, to where I assumed I'd find the roasting machine.  I didn't see one, but there was a musician setting up shop, so perhaps it was kept away for the event... FYI, an event attendee told me that the musician had volunteered his time today.  I'd meant to walk over there to tip him, but forgot (sorry!).  He was kind of hidden in a corner, so I didn't even see him, just his opened guitar case...  The SW burrito (flour tortilla) was good, or at least the few bites I had off of one half of it. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scramble-scottsdale-2?select=m1j2vRlt1BYb5Wlw9F5XMA  It contained mostly scrambled egg, and what made it delicious were the bits of chorizo.  Hopefully the leftover half has more chorizo in it.  The burrito also arrived with a side of hash browns- delicious, but a bit greasy! - and saucers of sour cream and tangy salsa, but I felt that the chorizo added the most flavor to the burrito.  I wouldn't order this again, but I did enjoy the hash browns.  Next time, I'll ask for extra-crispy.  Note: I could've elected to swap out the hash browns for the side of dollar pancakes, but I wanted to try both, and since I was here to help raise money to spay/neuter animals, then the more items I order, the better!  Side order of dollar pancakes (three cakes), with additional chocolate chips and blueberries. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scramble-scottsdale-2?select=H9ciLgozSL2osAD8r-NeiA  Delicious!  Cakes were fluffy, not heavy/dense, and the chips and blueberries were huge and plentiful!  I would definitely order these again.  The Apple Cinnamon Energy Cakes sounded great to me, but the multigrain batter might be suspect (for me, as I'm allergic to certain \"good for you\" grains and seeds), so until I investigate further...  FYI, the maple syrup here isn't pure maple syrup, so bring your travel-sized bottles if you cannot have syrups blended with cheap corn syrup (corn allergy-sufferer here!).  I might return to try the French French Toast (provided that the vanilla custard doesn't contain powdered sugar) and more of the pancakes.  Additional notes:   1. Coffee beverages are made with Ghirardelli (chocolate and caramel) and Torani syrups. 2. The Sweet Potato Hash contains mushrooms and zucchini, and other items, but she lost me at mushrooms (love and miss them, but am allergic).   3. Scramble DOESN'T offer Chicken-fried Steak.  What? 4. Free coffee at Yelp check-in!  I'll use it next time I go."}
{"text":"Mimosas are good and a great price only $4. I loved my southwest burrito 9.50, very filling. It's 2 eggs, chorizo, avocado and jalapeno cream cheese in a flour tortilla and comes with side of hash browns. I added shine Chula green pepper sauce to add shine great to it. They have btw they have 6 Chula flavors and other hot sauce choices. Have fountain soda, fresh brewed coffee with multiple milk and cream choices and a plethora of sweetener options. My mom got the meat scramble 9.50, however she felt the scramble size was small. It's 2 eggs, bacon, sausage and ham. It does come with hash browns and toast for sides. I really enjoyed it and will return for brunch again. Bottomless coffee was good and priced per usual dining costs, I like that it's a to go cup so if you eat in you can get a refill to go when finished."}
{"text":"Food was fine but nothing special... Clean, sleek ambiance with a nice patio. The indoor seating area is all wide open so you're right next to the person at the next table with no barriers. Can be really loud when busy. Lots of vegan options if that's important to you...I prefer Wildflower which is right up the street."}
{"text":"I liked the breakfast, probably wouldn't eat here without a coupon though."}
{"text":"Stayed at an AirBnB close to Scramble. We went there everyday and the service, quality of food and overall atmosphere was great. Varied menu, options for everyone and variety for people like us who went there multiple days in row.   More importantly, everyone we interacted with was friendly and sincere.   Can't wait to go back tomorrow. BTW: loved the bacon!"}
{"text":"Can't rave enough about this place! Always consistent in food and service! The fresh orange juice is definitely a favorite"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is nice, but there are several reasons I won't be back - and why you should consider some other local breakfast places instead!  We ordered all vegan and/or vegetarian items during our visit, and even talked to the front staff about how impressed we were with the vegan options they had. Yet our daughter's French Toast was served tasting like sausage for some reason. I'm guessing they accidentally put a side of sausage on the plate and switched it out before giving it to us? Not sure, but obviously that was gross.  Scramble has gluten-free options as well but they're almost all meat options, which is all naturally gluten-free anyway. If you're going to boast about your gluten-free options, you should have something special that's GF not just stuff everyone else has. GF French Toast would have been awesome.  My coffee was served hot when I ordered it iced, and our eggs weren't cooked properly (the whites were even runny-ish), and while the manager did notice and apologize, we weren't offered any type of credit, coupon, refund, or anything else really."}
{"text":"Food is great ! Mimosas and french toast!? Yes please! Staff is friendly ; the place has a pretty Laid back vibe which I like very much :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the mushroom and bacon omelette, it was nice size along with some really yummy crispy shredded hash browns. Everything came fresh and fast, was super delicious and really hit the spot. Glad we came here. Coffee was fresh and hot and I enjoyed the atmosphere and the theme. It was almost like a mix between first watch and chipotle. I ate really fast because everything was so good. Son had chocolate chip pancakes and side of bacon. He smashed on the pancakes didn't touch the overcooked bacon. Really satisfied and really deserved the 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"The BEST breakfast sandwich in town!  Every time I go, I say I'm going to try something new, but I always get the Sunrise Sandwich because I know it's so good.  And even though I can only 1/2, when I re-heat the other half later it is still really good.  My husband had to try the Chef's Special cinnamon swirl pancakes--also amazing!  We definitely think they should be on the menu permanently!"}
{"text":"I've been to scramble several times some times i'm impressed and others i don't enjoy the food at all. great atmosphere could be cleaner. Staff is nice and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I have driven past scramble several times a day for so long as far back as I can remember. I have always drooled at photos on Instagram of that cinnamon roll that's been made famous. Today was the day I was able to try it because it was mom's day out! I ordered the chili Verde burrito in the cinnamon roll and was so delighted at this morning's breakfast! For being a Saturday morning, my food was delivered right away to my table. I sat outside and enjoyed the cool weather because who knows how much longer that's going to last. Service was impeccable and did I mention extremely fast? I'm extremely happy I tried this place I was intending to eat at breakfast club last minute decided upon this eatery. I took my leftovers home and cannot wait to enjoy them later. PSA: Photos do not do justice."}
{"text":"I tried the vegan french toast and my bf had the veggie scramble. both were quite good. we both got the sweet potatoe hash... it was just ok. might be better if they cooked the sweet potatoes all the way. we sat outside with our puppy. nice patio but needs a good rinse...there were little ants on all the tables."}
{"text":"2.5 Scramble, I wanted to love you, but I walked away just loving your coffee.   Hey, the concept is great, but some of the stuff served here reminded me of stuff I make on the weekends when I have time to cook.  Although they had a lot of seemingly tasty options, my huevos rancheros were nothing exciting.    My dish consisted of  blue corn & quinoa chips, spicy soyrizo, covered with 3 eggs, cheddar and seasoned black beans. I liked the pico de gallo, but I needed more spice.  My pal ordered a panini, while my other pal got an egg white omelet. All of us walked away yearning for more, but with hopes that it could be better.   Guess we will need to come back and try again. Based on my SF and Portland eats, this just didn't measure up."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome selection of juiced drinks plus lunch items. Great service in a well lit, spotlessly clean, cheerful environment.  Good selection of hot sauces, too!"}
{"text":"I am coming to the conclusion that Scottsdale-ians just do NOT approve of a big breakfast. Everyone here must eat smoothies and fruit salads for breakfast, because it is VERY difficult to find a good bacon and eggs with some hashrbowns around this town.   Scramble had a big menu, so while I only gave it 3 stars, I would definitely go back and try something else if I lived here. being just a spring training traveler, I am not so sure.   Pet Peeve: Butter my toast!   The place was super clean, really nice looking - I would have to try a BRIZZA if I lived nearby! haha"}
{"text":"Wasn't looking for this, but so glad we found it.  Can't wait to go back and try some of the other items.  Two f us shared the Smoked Gouda and bacon Brizza...breakfast pizza.  I had the bacon infused Bloody Mary.  Yummy!  You order at the register and the bring it to your table...quickly!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with surprisingly delicious latte! Highly recommend eggs Benedict and lox on bagel. Kind and helpful stuff. Next time we're nearby - for sure will come back!"}
{"text":"Love the food (especially their fresh OJ and pancakes) and the service, but felt the music was a little too loud at this location for a Sunday morning breakfast.  If you're looking for a more quiet breakfast or brunch, I would just go to their other location in Phoenix.  The Phoenix location seems to have a better shaded area in their patio too!"}
{"text":"This place is very mediocre.  My eggs were not hot.  The biscuits were rather tasteless.  The portions are small, but the prices are steep.  I prefer many other local places for breakfast."}
{"text":"Had to go order at Scottsdale Scramble. Kale And Quinoa Salad. I am not obsessed with Kale like most people these days but I loved it! Apple Cider dressing was delish and mellowed the kale out. It also had dried cranberries and parm cheese. Quinoa and sunflower seeds added a nice crunch! I did add chicken to the salad. People are so friendly there. Great customer service! Like that Scramble does special events like Painting Nights, Cooking classes with local az companies and I heard they do Breakfast for Dinner events to give back to the community. PS this location has adult beverages. Yass!"}
{"text":"Found this on yelp, and we were thrilled with it. I had the Phoenix omelette, my wife and kids had the pancakes.  Fast service, good food, pretty reasonable prices, and gluten free options for my son with celiac  disease."}
{"text":"Definitely a long wait!  smoothie was great nice seating but I don't see myself comming back a second time"}
{"text":"Eat here all the time. Breakfast is great. They offer pretty much everything and have a turkey meat option for breakfast meat for those of us that don't eat pork so that's always good. I love their hot tea. I don't know the brand they serve but it's a loose leaf. The coffee is also pretty good. It's not the cheapest breakfast spot in town but the food is always pretty good so I keep coming back. The patio is a draw as well for a beautiful morning."}
{"text":"I thought the food was  good and coffee was great. The outside patio was very relaxing. The restaurant was really cute and the staff was very nice. The price was not too expensive."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Food comes out fast and fresh, and there are several options. Smoothies are good, I recommend Banana-Peach. Also, the Sunrise Sandwich is delicious! Modern atmosphere, and I like that you can choose to sit inside or outside."}
{"text":"This was not what expected driving by. I was thinking more sit down and order but it was still good. It had lots of wonderful things about it -Great service, reasonable price drinks (mimosa, etc) and quick food service."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly and the process pretty efficient for a made-to-order breakfast. Prices were pretty much on par with most of Scottsdale.   Ingredients tasted fresh, my Costa Burrito was pretty tasty, filling and with a little bit of a spice. The side of bacon was a little pricey, hash browns were included and well prepared. I would probably order the same thing again if I came back.  The French Toast Looked amazing!  Wife enjoyed her eggs Benedict, but she hasn't mentioned them fourteen times since we left, so they must not have been anything outstanding.  If you're looking for something casual, with bottomless self-serve coffee, and a friendly staff, give Scramble a shot!"}
{"text":"Cute new breakfast spot with a cool, modern atmosphere. Really nice patio - it wasn't very busy when I went for brunch (around noon on a Saturday), but I've heard it gets packed earlier in the day. It's an order-at-the-counter type of a place, when I went it wasn't a long wait and our food was brought out relatively quickly.   I had the Southwest Burrito - a breakfast burrito with chorizo, cheddar, avocado, egg and jalapeno cream cheese. I'm also an avocado nut and it definitely could have used more avocado - it had a very small amount. It was good, a little heavier than I'm used to with the cream cheese and the tortilla was very buttery. I'm glad I don't know the calorie count or I probably wouldn't have eaten for the rest of the day.    A lot of the menu items are served with hash browns - they were ok, nothing amazing, but not bad. Overall a good experience here - I live in the neighborhood so I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"A breakfast place with a vegan menu? Yes, please!! The take out service is super fast too - even when they're packed. Everything I've tried has been awesome. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time using Yelp.  Visiting Phoenix area and wanted a healthy breakfast.   Found Scramble and it is great. Menu has wide variety. Sweet potato hash perfect sub for hash browns.  Fast and friendly.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"What a fantastic little breakfast place!  I ate here with my friend one day on our trip to Scottsdale, and we both loved it.  She ordered one of their Scrambles, and I got the Southwest Burrito with chorizo, cheddar, avocado, egg & jalapeno cream cheese.  It was quite possibly the best breakfast burrito I've ever had.  It had a bit of a kick to it, but I like it like that.  I highly recommend it.  Also, the restaurant was very clean and the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"First visit and very impressed! Not what you would expect from a breakfast restaurant. You order your food at the front and find a place to sit - similar to PeiWei. The staff is very courteous and professional. You can tell they take a lot of pride in the work they do here. It's very clean and tidy. Great food. Dog friendly patio. Sourdough fans unite!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I'd been to the location in Phoenix and decided to bring my kids for brunch. It's reasonably priced, there are lots of menu options so there's something for everyone. It's fast-casual style so you order and the counter, take a number and find a seat. it's easy to order, the food came out pretty fast, and it was fresh and great-tasting. The staff were very attentive and helpful. My kids loved it too and we'll be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I recently just went here and I fell in love with it! This place is fast, easy and extremely yummy! This place is very affordable as well."}
{"text":"I love coming to scramble, and it's a definite go to when I don't want to wait too long at all.  I enjoy their breakfast wraps, the eggs are scrambled well and the portions are good too. Not too small not huge. I like the lunch wraps and the soups are pretty tasty, though I do add stuff to the wraps to add a bit more of what I like for example avocado which is an up charge of .75 cents which is pretty cheap, however I was kinda bummed they charged for the tomatoes. This is the first time I actually investigated the receipt because of the review, but I never feel the bill is ever too pricey and I'll always order whatever I want.   I tried a smoothie today and I like it a lot. There's no weird aftertaste to it and the consistency is really creamy I got the mango and did banana with it instead of the mango/banana that's on the menu. 20 oz for $5 not bad. I shared it bc I'm not a huge sweets girl anyway.   I sit outside when I can as long as the suns out. Also they often have heaters outside when it's really chilly, however at that point I'm staying inside.  Overall the staff is awesome they go above and beyond when they can and they're all always running around hard at work. I love the order and sit concept. You essentially have 5 servers because anyone working on the floor is willing to act as such. THIS MEANS TIP THEM !! The staff is also aware of their regulars , I appreciate that attention to detail.   Thank you scramble for being, fast, easy, friendly, and delicious !!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a top breakfast spot, but a great alternative to waiting in long lines on a weekend for breakfast.  The restaurant is fast, but the ambiance, service, and food isn't as good as it's competitors.  If you need breakfast fast this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We just ate here for the first time and were very pleased. I have some dietary restrictions, which can be a pain to accommodate. They were happy to accommodate me and even made a substitution for me, which a lot of restaurants won't do. The service was great, everyone was very friendly, and the food came out promptly. The food was really good, I got the breakfast sandwich and my boyfriend had a bizza. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service here is EGGcellent.  You wait in line yo place your order and place your number on the table.  They bring your food to your table, and when you finish they will clear the plates. The restaurant is quite clean, always a plus.  This being said, their food is rather bland.  I dined during the lunch hour and opted for a chicken bacon wrap and side salad.  The ingredients themselves were fresh, but there was a lack of flavor.  Perhaps an upgrade to Chipotle mayo or something more flavorful.  The side salad was iceberg lettuce with a few croutons. ..not exciting.  There is both indoor and outdoor dining available.  Also, they have free WiFi.  The catch is that you have to sign up for their emails to get access."}
{"text":"The grease in the food kind of counteracts the healthy concept.  Had tofu scramble and regular hash browns"}
{"text":"Yummy!! I could eat here everyday! The Chicago breakfast pizza is the most amazing thing on the menu! Try it with bacon and jalapeño cream cheese! Great staff as well - all around great, fast, breakfast place!"}
{"text":"My sis treated me and other family members to this place today. Omg, wonderful! We shared the veggie omelette and buttermilk pancakes. Whoa the hash browns and veggies were so fresh. Thank orange juice freshly squeezed. Fantastic. Look for orange umbrellas on patio. Great place great ambiance. I will be back."}
{"text":"Fast casual breakfast place and in my opinion it's just as good as Breakfast Club down the road. I got the eggs benedict and it was delicious. You walk in, menu is on the wall, and they bring the food out to you. My girlfriend got the whole wheat pancakes and they were delicious. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick breakfast after hiking Camelback mountain. I had the vegan scramble, which was good, but I would've liked it to contain more vegetables (it was mostly seasoned tofu). Their biscuits were amazing, and I consider myself a \"biscuit connoisseur\", so I am hard to please. If I lived in Phoenix, I would be a regular at this place."}
{"text":"I have been coming here almost every weekend for the past year. Getting breakfast with my friends and girlfriend. They serve Vegan options that are amazing so we frequent this place. This past visit however was extra special. When my girlfriend and I came to the counter to place our order, Cameron took our order and asked us our names, recognized us for our consistent patronage and remembered our orders. Told us he appreciated our business and said \"the coffee is on me today.\" A very in expected surprise. He is a fine employee and is showing his worth to this place of business. Thanks for making our experience that much better Cameron!"}
{"text":"Scramble was mad good! It the decor inside was nothing spectacular but was cute.   I ordered the vegan burrito that had tofu, soyrizo, peppers and love. It was seasoned perfectly! I loved it. It was big too! I couldn't finish the 2nd half. It came with sweet potato hash but was mixed with rosemary and it threw the whole thing off for me. I was hoping for something sweeter with maybe some pecans or something in it. It was not sweet and the rosemary overpowered it. I would definitely order the burrito again.  The lady ordered a veggie omelet with hash browns and it was well seasoned as well she said.   I topped my order off with a banana and peach smoothie w/ soy milk. It was bomb! I will definitely come back if I'm in the AZ area."}
{"text":"The service and menu is out of this world.  The cheddar hash browns is amazing, nothing like it.  Ranch is Huevos is amazing, the owner is great."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast choices. Service is fast. Food was good and so was the Bloody Mary"}
{"text":"Went back to Scramble for Mother's Day. Cameron kept his word and comped two breakfasts for me and my mom on Mother's Day. Food was much better this time. Service excellent."}
{"text":"Super cute (pet friendly) patio with lots of seating.  Very nice staff, pretty interior.  And great food.  We love breakfast all day -- and found our omelets very tasty, hash browns crunchy on top and not greasy.  There are lots of egg-based choices so we'll go back, but they also have salads and sandwiches that look yummy."}
{"text":"Great breakfast at affordable prices with excellent customer service. Chorizo breakfast burrito was perfect. Also the kids meal comes with a cool little toy."}
{"text":"Had some scrambled eggs with fresh veggies and delicious hash browns potatoes and coffee in a clean and bright place!"}
{"text":"I walked in this restaurant with some friends on labor day, we were all so excited to try out the vegan menu. With me is my service animal Oliver, who is trained to bark if i go into anemic shock-a condition where i faint often due to lack of iron in my blood. Below is some information that the manager might need to research on, as he proceeded to argue and embarrass me upon welcome. I was told to leave in the most rude manner, demanded i tell him more than once what service Oliver provides me, raising his voice at me, and demanding identification.  Please reconsider who you staff your businesses with."}
{"text":"This will be our new \"must visit\" restaurant whenever we come to Phoenix. The Brizza was amazing along with the French toast! The food was so good that if I had a ring I would've proposed to my girlfriend!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place to eat breakfast. My daughter and I split one of their breakfast pizzas and it was great. The serving size was plenty for two of us. We opted for bacon instead of sausage with the eggs and hash browns all on the thin crust and it was really good. The staff was friendly and the cashier made helpful suggestions. We will return."}
{"text":"Had high expectations coming in and was not very satisfied with the food. I've had many different kinds of southwest burritos and this was the lesser of them. The southwest burrito had too much egg and not enough chorizo and barely any avocado at all. The only thing I really liked was the hash browns."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you want a quick breakfast. Order at the bar and then take a seat. They do serve bloody Mary's and mimosas so that is nice. Need to work on the menu as it is kind of limited for your average breakfast joint. Eggs Benedict Was good. Coffee drink was too sweet."}
{"text":"Loved this place for breakfast/brunch. The vibe is energetic with a busy crowd, place is modern and service is fast. We ordered omelets, they came with bread and hash brown. I think it was around 7-8$ and so goood!"}
{"text":"I normally only write reviews when there's something wrong, but this experience at Scramble was oh so right.  First time in, I was greeted by large menu boards on the left wall. Nice fast casual approach to breakfast. Order at the counter, display your number and amazing breakfast in minutes. Boom, can't get much easier than that.  The space is open, vibrant and radiating with good energy. Creative copy is displayed all over the walls adding fun character to the dining area. Staff was nice and unobtrusive, yet readily available to serve you. Perfect.  So, how about the food? I ordered the Sante Fe Benedict. Such a fresh approach to a traditional breakfast item. It's everything you'd expect from a Benny, but with jalapeño corn bread and Chipotle Hollandaise. Best breakfast in a long time with a unique execution.   Scramble deserves your attention."}
{"text":"Place was just average..it coould of been the staff and cooks possibly that Sunday in July 2015. I had the veggie omlette and the apple pancakes and was a little dissapointed. I had the been to the Phoenix location and it was so oustanding."}
{"text":"Really good Huevos Rancheros....not the usual with flour tortilla but with blue corn chips and a nice, not too spicy chorizo.  I would have liked to have had some potatoes with it for the price, though.  Husband liked the coffee and enjoyed his Western Omelette.  Plenty of food!"}
{"text":"Superb  breakfast place!!! Delicious food and exceptional service! Restaurant is very clean and lovely atmosphere..i will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Scramble is BOMB! I haven't tried anything \"scrambled\" yet, but it's because I'm too obsessed with their strawberry french toast to try anything else. Get the scramble browns!! It's my three favorite things (potatoes, bacon, and cheese) fried into a crispy hash brown. Very easy ordering with minimal wait time. Great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Scramble #2 this place is impressive, a great looking restaurant and to back it up the same great service as there phoenix location.a good place to have a morning screwdriver or just a quality cup of coffee.they also have cooking classes which are so much fun can't wait for the next one."}
{"text":"Scramble is a locally-owned, small chain of quick and casual breakfast/lunch spots that prides itself on serving as many locally sourced ingredients (aka Farm-to-Fork) as possible. However they go about it, there's one thing that always goes into everything they do here, and that my friends is Quality--with a capital Q! This was not my first visit to Scramble, as I visited their Phoenix location on my previous AZ trip and loved it just as much. This particular visit was on Thanksgiving morning, and the reason I knew they were open was I had messaged the business the day before on my trusty Yelp app and received a confirmation from Scramble MGMT within a few minutes--now that's service!   Santa Fe Benedict- If perfectly cooked Eggs and Ham served on top of a sweet and spicy Jalapeño Cornbread and topped off with a creamy Chipotle Hollandaise Sauce doesn't get your mouth watering, then maybe you should check your pulse. I rarely do breakfast these day, but when I do I usually go for the Benedicts, and Scramble's Santa Fe is about as good as it gets. The uniqueness of this dish is only topped by its taste as the creamy eggs and sauce mix with the salty and sweet ham and spicy cornbread to make your tongue play Beethoven's 5th repeatedly.   Coffee & Salsa Bar- Special big-ups for their fully-stocked condiment and coffee bar. While their coffee is merely passable, all the accoutrements to make your cup perfect are right there. Their Salsa selection is also pretty amazing, as they have your ubiquitous Sriracha and Tabasco--plus **FIVE** flavors of Cholula! As a certified Pepper Head who always needs to kick things up a notch, this really brought figurative --and literal!-- tears of joy to my eyes.   Service & Ambiance- Despite it being Thanksgiving morning all the employees were very friendly and efficient. I really like their pay beforehand system, which is the exact opposite of most breakfast places. Scramble's décor is very modern and sterile looking with lots of stainless steel accents. While not my favorite décor, it kinda fits Scramble's theme of fast, fresh and efficient. There are multiple TVs throughout showing everything from SportsCenter to a variety of local and national News outlets.   Value- Scramble provides an eggcellent value for the quality and quantity of which you're being served. With most meals below $10 and kid's meals at only $3.99 this is a great place to take your family without breaking the bank.  If you're looking for a quick, delicious, (semi)healthy, Quality and value-priced breakfast, or lunch, then look no further than Scramble. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Finally a breakfast joint I can eat at! I usually hate going out for breakfast because I am the friend who cant eat anything on the menu. This place has an awesome vegan menu!   I had the vegan tofu scramble. Now I am a critic because I am an excellent vegan cook and I have mastered the tofu scramble. This dish definitely lacked some spices, I recommend turmeric and paprika. Get creative with some onion, garlic, and corn. Tofu scramble should always have a side of salsa.. vegans aren't boring, we like to eat with flavor.   Other than that tough criticism, my friend loved his breakfast burrito! He said we will be back forsure!  And I will be back to try out the rest of the vegan menu."}
{"text":"The brizza was so delicious never anything like it. The tofu scrambler was good too but not as good as the brizza. Will try the French toast next time."}
{"text":"The Traditional Eggs Benedict was perfection! I would go back again and again. They are timely, the ingredients are obviously fresh and the staff very welcoming. The online ordering makes everything very convenient too. Oh and there is an outdoor area for dog lovers who want to bring their dogs on a nice day. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Average at best. Sarah H and I came after riding with big appetites and decided to split the vegan chorizo burrito, berry pancakes and a side of jalapeño cornbread. The burrito was great but everything else lacked. The sweet potato hash that came with the burrito was raw and crunchy. The pancakes were ok but tasted like they came out of a box at best. It was edible but not somewhere we will be back to."}
{"text":"I have not had a bad meal here yet! The place is clean and the staff is friendly. Food arrives in a timely manner and everything always tastes good and fresh! It's also nice that I can choose between breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"Ok place for vegans to take non-vegans for breakfast. However, be warned that the vegan options are basically just the normal eggs-dominated breakfast replaced with soy, etc. I don't like eggs and I don't like fake eggs. And while I appreciate being remembered (by having a section of the menu showing \"Vegan\"), I also don't like feeling like an afterthought, and that is how I felt after eating my portion here.  I would suggest if you want great breakfast food created FOR vegans, look elsewhere.   For the owners, if you are serious about serving awesome vegan fare, hire a vegan consultant to revamp your vegan menu from scratch."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast! It wasn't to much or to little, it was just right! My husband and I had their scramblers: the morning with chorizo, green chile topped with pico de gallo and I don't remember mine but it had mushrooms and spinach. When we come back for a visit we'll be sure to come back. Yummy! Oh the service was on point! The crew was friendly and helpful but not in an overbearing way. Again coming back again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My first mistake I think was not sticking with the breakfast portion of the menu in a place that is known for breakfast.  But it was lunch time and the Cuban Panini sounded so good...but was SO disappointing! One of my fellow diners also ordered a panini - the roast beef...we both sent them back to the kitchen because the cheese wasn't even melted.  Then they came back over toasted and hard to eat.  The third person in our party stayed true to the breakfast side of the menu and mostly enjoyed her meal except for the burned toast.  Whomever is supervising the kitchen should get their act together and take a look at the dishes as they are going out to the guest! Who would send out burned toast and call that acceptable??? One of us had a side salad with the disastrous panini's and there was a the core stem from a head of lettuce mixed in! I showed it to our waiter, who took it and showed it to a \"manager\", but we got no response, we paid our bill and left very disappointed.  I have two words for management at Scramble:  QUALITY CONTROL!!   Breakfast is the easiest type of cooking there is, and doing it poorly suggests boredom in the kitchen and a true lack of supervision.  And turning out food like we were served yesterday is unacceptable.  I would be willing to give Scramble another try, for the benefit of the doubt.  Most of the other patrons around us seemed to enjoy their meals.  Everyone has a bad day now and then.  I'll stick to breakfast next time."}
{"text":"I went early this morning and dined in.  Driving south on N Scottsdale Rd, I could see the \"Scramble\" sign facing the street, so it was an easy find.  Parking seemed a little odd to me.  There are only a few parking spaces in front of the restaurant, and there are a lot of stores that share the same parking lot. I imagine parking is a real pain later in the day, but that early in the morning it was fine.   On to the food.  I like that there is a section on their menu titled Vegan, so you don't have to go searching for all those little \"v\" or \"vg\" symbols used by most places. This makes things so much simpler.  Because it was my first time at a Scramble (I have yet to visit their downtown location), I wanted to try a couple of things so I'd know what to get on any future visits.   Vegan French Toast: It was quite good, tasty even, but not mind-blowing. It was sprinkled with powdered sugar (which I love!) and I didn't even need to put the vegan butter on it.  I was grateful for the sweet and thick vegan syrup. Some vegan syrups can be watery and boring; not theirs. The toast was a bit challenging to cut (or maybe my utensil-using skills are challenged); I was seriously afraid that a piece of syrup-laden toast was gonna go catapulting through the air and into another patron's hair/face, etc.  I tried to carefully see-saw my way through it... I hope no one was watching me.  It wasn't that the bread was hard; it just took a lot of effort once you got to the bottom of that bread. Maybe it's the bread? Maybe it's me? I don't know. But honestly, it was still very good; just not amazing. It came with a side of fruit (actually she asked me what I wanted for my side and I just stuck with the fruit), which was fresh and sweet.   Scramble: So, here's what I did with my scramble. I wanted to try the Vegan Soyrizo Burrito, sans tortilla, but I wanted the spinach and red onions that come with another vegan scramble dish. And I'd read some reviews saying that the scramble could use a little more seasoning.  So I simply requested no tortilla, add spinach + red onions, add extra seasoning and make it extra spicy. I also requested that they cook it hard (I don't like mushy tofu scramble). The result was yummy! It was perfectly spiced. Kudos to the chef for hooking me up! (I believe they said they added jalapeño juice and Sriracha sauce.) For the side, I got the sweet potato hash.  It was good. I think if you're a sweet potato fan (y'all who must have your baked sweet potatoes & sweet potato fries) then you'll love it. I love regular potatoes, so next time I'll get the good ole hash browns. (I checked with a manager, who said they're vegan: cooked with salt, pepper, & garlic (no butter).   The food is very light too. I ate 1/2 of each dish and I didn't feel \"heavy\" like I do after some taste-testing sessions, which is great for a morning, start-your-day meal.   Pricing? For Scottsdale, it's inexpensive. My vegan french toast was less than $8, and my vegan soyrizo scramble was less than $9.   Inside was nice, neat, clean, bright (sunshiny), and had a large, open dining area. There were mostly tables, but around the southern perimeter there is booth seating along the wall, with additional chairs across from the tables.  There is a center station with condiments, self-serve drinks (water for me), utensils, etc.  There were several large TVs, each showing something different: sports, worldwide news, cartoons, and some other cable network cooking show were all on for you to glance towards and enhance your lip-reading skills. (Sub-titles were on for those too lazy for lip-reading) I sat inside, although I couldn't help but notice how cute the patio area was. It's a large/spacious patio too. I'm sure it'll get a lot of action come autumn.   The employees are all very nice, offering up friendly smiles and being attentive and helpful.  3 different people asked how my meal was as they walked by.   I would love to see them expand their vegan menu (ahem: vegan pancakes!), but for now I'm happy to have somewhere to go for a vegan breakfast that's not 30+ minutes away."}
{"text":"I think Scramble is definitely a good place if you want atmosphere, to sit down, and to enjoy a relatively good meal. They have a great up-beat vibe, and are very helpful if you have any questions or need to change something in a dish to fit your food preferences/needs. It is also a good place to talk with friends over brunch because as weird as it may sound, the sound in the restaurant doesn't carry very far.  However, the prices seem pretty ridiculous at times. I've experienced fairly good food here, but I don't want to keep having to pay $10 for breakfast-that's dinner pricing!  In the end, I recognized that their hashbrowns are pretty good along with the eggs. (I would hope so considering the place is called Scramble!)"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. Everything is SO delicious and their to-go orders never let me down. UsuallyI will get anything that comes with their hashbrowns...they are incredible."}
{"text":"I'm always in a rush, but I love a great breakfast, so this place is perfect in my mind... The food is very good and it's fast, plus it's all local, so it's super fresh! They are very attentive to your opinion, so when they come around and ask how something is, don't be afraid to tell them if you don't enjoy it."}
{"text":"We were excited about the gluten-free menu because we have a daughter that is highly allergic to it, when we got there the gluten free menu looked great, but the one thing that was NOT gluten free that we were going to get was french toast which didnt exactly make sense seeing how if they had gluten free bread it could have been easily made, I asked for eggs over medium since it was an egg sandwich I dont do too runny on a sandwich..when I got my order eggs were over EXTREMELY easy and were runny before I touched the sandwich, the food was mediocre and was not worth the price, they got several things wrong which was ok since that happens everywhere, but they were not bust at the time, these things were still not too bad until...our kids complained about how the milk tasted so we looked at the cartons they were drinking out of....THE MILK WAS OVER A WEEK EXPIRED!!!!!!!!!! We are very lucky our kids did not get sick...the did apologize and seemed very concerned about it which is good, but we will not be returning to this place, over priced and the food was not as amazing as we expected, Scottsdale seems to be a very \"uppity\" town and a lot of people seem to be a little stuck up and act like the food is off the charts...well news flash, it's not, ate in Scottsdale several times and the food is no different than a small town, actually smaller towns seem to have better food, I will stick to my smaller businesses in the future, thanks but no thanks to this place."}
{"text":"Came in to finally check it out. First time for husband, son and myself.    Stopped in at 1:30.  First off, not a big fan of the walk up and order at the counter.  Kinda pricey for sure.   My son  got a turkey wrap requested no romaine lettuce, but it came with iceberg. Husband and I got a cup of tortilla chicken soup.  We ask if it was made with white meat chicken, cashier said yes.  Well... The soup had dark meat!    I got a side of the breakfast turkey sausage; again I asked if it was good to the cashier.... Her response.... \"I don't know, I'm a vegetarian\".  I got it anyways, and so disappointed in both soup and breakfast sausage.  \"Cup\" of soup was measured as a CUP!    Sausage was cold.    My husband went and quietly spoke to the manager regarding this.  And she had nothing to say but sorry.     Not going back."}
{"text":"I live across the street from this place and tried it a couple of times after it opened. The results were dismal so I stayed away for about a year. Hungry and time stressed this morning I returned figuring it must have improved. Nope. Scramble continues to take the already deeply flawed concept of fast casual to a new low. Wanting only a couple of eggs with bacon, toast and hash browns I placed my $10 order with a cashier who seemed annoyed by my presence. She informed me that my coffee would be an extra $3 ($3!) and to get it in a disposable cup while i waited for my breakfast. Arriving at the \"coffee bar\" I found the coffee urn as well as the 1/2 and1/2 dispenser empty. On informing one of the half-awake robots the response was her being barely civil. On to the food. After waiting 25 minutes the plate arrived. Barely lukewarm it appeared that no one had thought or cared about the plate. The eggs, small but, thankfully, properly cooked,  were surrounded by cold sourdough toast, 2 pats of foil-wrapped frozen butter, and hash browns that were scattered around the plate, nearly cold and tasted like they had been cooked in motor oil. The piece de resistance were the 3 slices of bacon that were soggy, cold and had the texture and taste. of wet cardboard. Uhhhhhh................ 3 strikes and you're out. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Yummy vegan soyrizo burrito with hash browns. Beautiful outdoor seating. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We are from Tucson, and found this breakfast gem on Yelp!  Each of enjoyed the friendly service, hip and clean atmosphere, and the yummy food. The food came out quickly, and was very tasty. The steak and eggs were a great deal, my huevos rancheros was organized and tasty, and my wife loved her veggie scramble. We especially liked the coffee/spice bar in the middle of the room (they have Cholula!). The only thing that could be added to it is a cinnamon shaker. Great place!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever stopped for breakfast.  Grease flowed off my plate.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"We stopped here on vacation and we ordered a gringo burrito, Gouda bacon Brizza, and the banana peach smoothie they were all out standing! It's defiantly a nice quick place to go!"}
{"text":"I liked the egg white veggie omelette and sweet potato hash I had. Definitely a good option for quick breakfast or lunch if you're in the neighborhood. Side note: I'm guessing parking may be a problem on weekdays due to lots of dedicated spaces for other businesses."}
{"text":"I have been to soooo many diners and breakfast joints hoping to be WOW-ed with my all time favorite meal, egs benedict. And I was always disappointed. After my first visit today at Scramble, I was betond surprised with how delicious their benedict was. I cannot wait to make thi breakfast spot my new regular! Yay!!! Fresh, delicious food and coffee! Go!!!"}
{"text":"Bright, cheery atmosphere with prompt service,  good food and a smile. Price is average but all else is certainly above average. Very good. Don't forget to tip."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a breakfast person, prefer a bagel, but when I'm craving actual breakfast this is where I head. The vegan French toast and sweet potato hash are amazing. I literally get cravings for a sweet potato and end up just going for breakfast to have the sweet potato hash. Growing up I never liked French toast because it was excessively eggy and I hated that. Now that I'm vegan I've realized the Foods way better. For example the vegan French toast is what I picture when I think of French toast and there's no weird \"egg\" substance surrounding the bread. The Foods really fresh and the service is good. The parking lot is small though, so beware! But overall worth a trip, plus there's a lot more options on the menu to try."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I'm not impressed with this place. The reason? Poor food quality. I ordered an ordinary scramble eggs with bacon and side of fruits. The eggs tasted like rubber, I don't think they were prepared upon order...the fruit was tasteless and old, of course not the same idea that you get when they tell you \"fresh fruits\"...the bacon was okay, but I've had better ones. I'm sorry to give only two stars...after all the staff was really nice and friendly, however, in my opinion, they need to improve on their food quality.!!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Place was clean. The wait was short.  I placed a pick up order for the French Toast and chopped salad. The French Toast was ok, nothing special in my opinion. The chopped salad = no bueno. I had to pick out the \"good\" parts and sort out the brown lettuce and uncooked bacon. No so happy about that. I do have to say the bread stick that came with salad had a good texture.  The ranch dressing was not so yummy"}
{"text":"Updating my review because last time we were here the apple juice we bought had corn syrup in it, which we didn't like. During our most recent visit though we found they had 3 different kinds of bottled 100% juice available! I retract my previous comment regarding corn syrup juice :) Jellies still have it though.  Tip - If you don't want sugar in your coffee tell them. The first time I ordered a latte it was without sugar. The second time, it was sweetened. I prefer it without."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great restaurant!  Fabulous breakfast (I had the southwestern burrito), great coffee and the most attentive staff I've seen in years!  Breakfast and lunch only.  \"Bacon  infused Bloody Mary\"!!!  If it wasn't so early and I had already worked out I would absolutely try it!"}
{"text":"Good healthy breakfast. Very clean and pleasant atmosphere. I absolutely will comeback with my family."}
{"text":"Love love love this nice little local breakfast chain.  The eggs benedict -all varieties - are delicious.   I love the vegan french toast.  Yum.  Coffee is good with plenty of sweetener and lightener options.  Nice pet friendly patios and friendly staffs."}
{"text":"Best French toast in town period.  I've tried everything on the menu and my whole family loves it.  The vegan hash is out of this world, and so is the vegan French toast.  My wife being vegan everywhere we go I get to try the vegan option and they're excellent at scramble.    Also their egg cook must have been hatched himself; he cooks basted eggs like Elvis ruled rock n roll.   My kids just love the Brizzas.  What kid doesn't like pizza? It's like the best of both worlds pizza and breakfast - get outta here awesome.   Also their servers and cashiers are always quick and helpful.  I've never had less than excellent service in my 30 plus times going to scramble (at either location for that matter).    For all the snobby A-holes in Scottsdale that want to have their hand held and want to piss and moan about ingredients I don't know how Scramble isn't at the top,of their list.  Everything is fresh and Local.  Their eggs come from the farm same or next day.    I tried butterfields and butters and us egg and I just don't like them nearly as well.  Not as fresh, not as hip, not as nice of people.    Hands down the breakfast spot in Scottsdale for anyone that likes casual, delicious, dog friendly, courteous, fresh, and local it's Scramble.  Do your research you won't find fresher ingredients or nicer folks.    Oh and The patio is perfect for Scottsdale.    I've worked in restaurants and restaurant management for over 20 years and these guys are doing it right, paying it forward and it's paying off.    And if you are one of the people that doesn't like it - good go to Denny's enjoy a grand slam =/"}
{"text":"New location for Scramble A Breakfast Join restaurant.  Loved the idea (never been to one), but the food was less than just OK.  Been to Breakfast Club, Over Easy and love those types of breakfast restaurants, Pancakes, French Toast, Waffle etc, but at Scramble, the eggs came out cold, french toast was average and the syrup, is corn syrup from a 5 gallon jug.  Worst syrup.  You would think they could use real maple.    I would have enjoyed the breakfast, but food was average and cold.    Service was great tho, very nice people there.  Expected more tho. wanted it to be awesome."}
{"text":"The only thing \"wrong\" this place is that it is located in Scottsdale where there are other fantastic breakfast places. True, the ordering process was painfully slow. The food is average. There are better places to go....but if you're in this exact area, you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"As a vegan I head to Scramble frequently.  They offer good vegan options and the food is very good.  I usually get one of the tofu scrambles, but ALL vegan options are good!  The one request I would have is that they should provide gluten-free & vegan toast.  Currently the choices are either vegan with gluten, or gluten free but not vegan.   As a vegan with some gluten sensitivity, if I want toast I have to deal with the gluten.  I believe they get their bread from Gluten free creations, which offers excellent gluten free and vegan bread.  It'd be great if they used that."}
