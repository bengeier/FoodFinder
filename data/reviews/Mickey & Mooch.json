{"text":"Had my 1st and last dinner here tonight. We thought we would give this place a try as we have never dined here before. Place was pretty empty on a Sunday evening. We ordered our drinks which were brought to us pretty quickly. Then the waiter disappeared. He didn't come back for 20 minutes. He brought out some bread which I had hoped would be warm but it wasn't. My husband had the shrimp Pasta primavera which was plentiful yet nothing special. The sauce Was pretty much seafood bisque and nothing  special. I had the coconut shrimp which was pretty much a failure.It was dry and looked as if someone sent it back and they needed to move it out of the kitchen. They did give 10 shrimp which is a good portion. The waiter offered to get me something else but let's face it. I would end up watching my husband eat and 20 minutes later he would watch me eat. If it was disgusting it would have been a different story. No need to give it a second chance.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Mickey and Mooch tonight as our date night spot since they were participating in the Queen's Fest.  I made a 7:00 PM reservation for two.  We arrived at 6:50 PM and were promptly seated.  Our waiter was Chong and he was awesome!  He was extremely personable and knowledgeable.    I was born and raised in Charleston, SC so I wanted to try the Charleston Crab Soup.  It had a slight twist on the traditional She-Crab Soup, but delicious nonetheless.  My husband ordered the baby back ribs with mashed potatoes.  I ordered the jumbo scallops blackened with Cajun cream sauce with the Charleston grits (notice a theme here?).  Our meals were outstanding.  We couldn't finish everything and took home leftovers, including dessert.  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because of the seating arrangement.  The restaurant has a combination of tables, booths, and booths/chairs combo tables.  We were seated at one of these combo-type tables and the dining parties are pretty close together.  The party of three adults next to us were incredibly loud.  They made it difficult for my husband and I to carry on our own conversation because we could barley hear each other because they were so boisterous.  Now, we know why the party that checked in ahead of us made a special request in their reservation for a table and not a booth (we overheard the hostess confirming this with them before taking them to their table).  After reading through the reviews, we were a little nervous about going but glad we gave it a try.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Seems like this place has gone down hill, a lot.  Ordered steak medium, it arrived a few degrees shy of rare, they were out of the wine we wanted, pasta was over cooked and stuck together, didn't bother to re-fill sodas once during dinner."}
{"text":"Great food, good value, huge sides and it was really nice to be casual in a steak house.  We will be there a lot."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome food and a wonderful atmosphere. The scallop dish is to die for, I recommend getting it over pasta and the salmon with filet was great as well. Overall we had a great evening at Mickey & Mooch and would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing salmon, wine, and service!! I've been here several times and have never had a bad experience. My favorite meal is the salmon with mashed potatoes. Mickey is always so warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"This North Carolina version of a steakhouse, con kooky name (nicknames of college roommates), is a rare exception to the bad tomato rule:  superb waitstaff,  flavorful steaks, and a deliziosa Charleston crab soup."}
{"text":"I have luckily always had a great experience here. Fell in love with the 7 layer chocolate cake which I order every time I go. The shrimp and grits are amazing and the food portions are generous."}
{"text":"Mickey and Mooch has grown complacent in its offering to Lake Norman residents.  Being the only fine dining restaurant in town for years has created a lack of urgency around making sure guests have a memorable experience that makes them want to return.    The restaurant is still very beautiful inside, but you can start to see signs of unfixed wear in the details of the restaurant decor.  They have the modern open view kitchen, but the point of this is to show actual CHEFs working the kitchen line...not cooks.  Mickey & Mooch is skimping on chefs and it is not uncommon to see inside the glass kitchen 4 line cooks working the stations and not a professional chef in sight.  Not only can you see that the food is cook prepared, you can taste it.  There are some standouts--steaks are fantastic--but most prepared dishes, pastas, or anything that requires sauces and flavors is subpar for a nice restaurant.  Finally, there are very few really professional waiters and waitresses working M&M.  They now have a staff that seems more qualified for work at Denny's than a fine dining restaurant.  Until Mickey & Mooch changes up and starts trying to compete for business again, I will not be back and cannot recommend it."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week seated quickly .Was very  busy as we expected but our food came out quickly . Had the wedge salad very good and Lump crab cakes very good. I would recommend going to this restaurant.Only complaint it was very hot in the dinning room."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for our anniversary tonight. Arrived to an empty host/hostess stand despite a good sized crowd. Because we had reservations we were seated after a minute or so.   We sat at our table for a few minutes before being greeted by our waitress who then took a few more minutes to bring back water. Ok, they're busy. I get it. I ordered the shrimp & grits and my lady ordered the marinated chicken breast. We both got the one side as a salad, which was a decent house salad.   Now the main course is brought out. My shrimp & grits are admittedly pretty darn good. My lady comments how good the chicken is -- very good sauce and moist. Between the conversation we're holding we each have a few bites of our respective meals and then she stops with a frightened look on her face -- it's raw. I was shocked to find that she was not even close to exaggerating. Worse yet, she had eaten a few bites already. After sitting there for a few minutes hoping our waitress would check on us, we finally get her attention and she notices the raw chicken and offers to have it cooked longer. The appetite was long gone by that point and there was no way we were going to give the cook another chance to botch this.   Our waitress said she'd remove that from the check and unapologetically, after quite some time, she did; however, that salad that came with the meal was now a charge on the final bill along with my salad and shrimp and grits.   Not once did she seem concerned about my lady. Not once did a manager come over to talk to us. Somehow, out of pure habit I suppose, I even left her a tip!  I'm a pretty laid back guy, but this experience has me so upset how little care they show to their guests and that they can serve chicken of all meats highly undercooked.   I'm hoping this review shows many people how poor service sounds and gives you second thoughts when considering spending your hard earned money here.  This place really did deserve ZERO Stars tonight!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for special occasions.  The lump crab meat appetizer will melt in your mouth.  Don't go if you are in a hurry.  This is a dining experience.  The staff are engaging and professional.  I have never had anything that I didn't think was outstanding.  If you go on a weekend there will be music in the bar area.  Always top notch."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the food was mediocre and over-priced.  For the price we paid we could have gone to a high-end steakhouse, like Ruths Chris, but we tried Mickey and we were very disappointed.  The shrimp was rubbery, the steak was over-cooked from the way it was ordered, the family style grits tasted barely better than instant grits, and everybody I know can make better mashed potatoes.  To top it all off we felt sick for 24 hrs after eating.  The one bright spot was that the dessert was better than average (though not premium).  Extremely disappointed for a $100 meal for 2.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner, service, music and atmosphere.   Try the ribs and sauted cabbage and bacon...killer.  Crab cakes had very little to no filler.  Delicious.  We'd go back if we ever were through here again.    We don't know our servers name, but she was great.  Friendly, funny and attentive."}
{"text":"Background:  Saturday night dinner, first time guest, party of two, made reservations.  The Good:  Seated on time; cool old-school vibe to the place; decent wine list; wedge salad was outstanding; side dishes were great (HUGE loaded baked potato); crab cake was one of the best I've ever had; service was strong but not overwhelming or too stuffy; prices were very reasonable for steak houses in CLT.    The Bad:  We were seated right smack in the middle of two other parties at a 4-top table when there were plently of other open booths or other tables scattered around in more intimate parts of the restaurant.  It's just awkward when you can hear every word each other guest is saying when you know it doesn't have to be like this.  It's my understanding they chose to sat us in our location to balance out the workload of the servers - I get it, but it's still frustrating.  The steak was just OK.  When you pride yourselves on your steak, it better be good, but there was nothing special.  6 oz filet was cooked like I ordered, but it wasn't an especially tasty cut of meat.  Disappointing.  Maybe I just set the bar too high - I was expecting Del Friscos or Ruth Chris or Mortons and I received Outback."}
{"text":"Love the atmospher, great food....Ribeye was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The Mooch remains my go-to restaurant in the area.  Always consistently very good in both food and service.  Reasonable priced with a nice wine selection."}
{"text":"If I never eat here again, it'll be too soon. Just give me the Bob Evans down the road and that cardboard country freid steak.   Terrible, just terrible. All of it. I actually can;t find anything nice to say at all."}
{"text":"My wife got a gift card here, so we visited it for our first time and really enjoyed it. The food was very good, the seating was spaced out so you could have a nice quiet dinner, great music playing (but not too loudly), and courteous staff. We had a great couple's night out and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I sadly write this review. The food is great and their chocolate cake is amazing which is why I gave them the 2 stars.  The problem is the customer experience. It has gone down hill. They attempt to celebrate their high end feel and then leave patrons feeling like they are at an Applebee's.   I made a reservation online. After receiving a confirmation, I thought everything was ok. When I went back to check, there was an error. I called in to the restaurant to check, and apparently they miraculous ran out of tables for 3 hours after my original check in time.  They wouldn't honor my original confirmation, nor would they attempt to fit me in. No help, no service, nothing. Thus, no me going.   This is your warning, who knows what will happen when you will actually get past that hostess."}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST. Best food, Best staff (hi Alixandra!) Best owner... we always (always) enjoy our meal and the service is amazing. Mickey is not just the owner but a friend to all who enter. We look forward to our Friday night date at Mickeys and HIGHLY recommend dining here."}
{"text":"Recently went to this restaurant for my birthday, I highly recommend this establishment. The atmosphere was elegant & romantic, food was amazing!!! The service was also great. I felt welcomed, appreciated and treated like royalty.I would def go back."}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago and I have to say I was very impressed.  I got the NY strip and mashed potatoes.  I never get a NY strip but saw one go by on a servers tray on the walk to my table and it looked  good and it was.  I have some history with MM, we would frequent on special occasions when they first opened (late 90's?)  and always really enjoyed it.  Some time down the line we felt every time we went we got second class service (being younger and not in a suit and tie) so we stopped going.  This last visit is probably the first time I have been to MM in seven years and I would definitely go back.  Cheers"}
{"text":"If you're looking to splurge on a delicious meal--this is the place to go! My boyfriend and I came here for restaurant week and it was fantastic. Our server was very attentive throughout the course. We both had the Charleston Crab soup for our first course. A little spicy, but no complaints here! We also had the 6oz filet mignon with shrimp scampi. It only came with three pieces of shrimp, but it was more than enough! I had a HUGE side of the Yukon mash potatoes. For dessert, we both had the tuxedo cheesecake. Absolutely delicious! Everything here is cooked so well. We will definitely be back again for restaurant week!"}
{"text":"My family and I are out of towners from Raleigh, and I'm glad we decided on this, despite the lack of reviews here on yelp!  I'll keep it simple, the food was excellent and in large portions, so if you're with family you can mix and match with each other. Our server, Michael was awesome, he paid attention to us, but wasn't pushy or annoying.   Overall a great experience, I knocked off one star for the dated decor and kinda cheesy large half circle booths, but it's a win win as far as great steaks and friendly service goes!"}
{"text":"Actually a 1.25 star. Food was very good. Very reasonable prices. Good service... Unfortunately the hair in the scallops ruined the entire experience. They did offer to take the scallops off of the bill. In my opinion, not enough."}
{"text":"Great food all around our table. Sides are HUGE and our waitress Dana gave us the best service I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"I love the bacon grease salad dressing! Everything tastes wonderful there. I love the homemade butter for the bread.  I love the cabbage cooked in pork.  I really enjoyed the truffle fries.  Their salmon was very good.  We saw a steak dinner that looked pretty and beefy! I have never disliked anything from this restaurant."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been in here quite a bit. Tonight we decided to do carryout rather than dining in. I called four times before anyone answered. Once someone answered they were very short and put me on hold for five minutes. Once they returned they were very rude and short. Don't do carryout. All of our dining experiences have been great though. If it wasn't for the poor carryout experience I would have given them a 5."}
{"text":"The reason you spend $ here is because it's just that good. Service is excellent! The food melts in your mouth and is totally worth the wait to get to your table! Oh and I bet you didn't know this.... they order that bread from a special bakery that only makes it for them! My husband and I first discovered this place about 5 years ago and always go here for our anniversary and special occasions.   I always order the lobster tails roasted with the loaded mashed potatoes. The salads are very fresh. My husband loves the crab cakes with their spicy sauce (I think it's jalapeno) drizzled on top. If you get a mixed drink from the bar they don't skimp on the liqueur and water it down with ice like some places. Quality = Micky and Mooch!  We usually sit in a booth near the bar but have also gotten a booth in the dining room and a table in the room with the lake view. Lisa mentioned it's a great ambiance and I could not agree more! A perfect meal and a great place to enjoy a romantic evening with a loved one."}
{"text":"Ok but more about showing away and spending money. Upscale but nOt exceptional"}
{"text":"Phenomenal restaurant!  It's in the price range of Del Frisco's and Ruths Chris, but the food is better and slightly less expensive.  We went on a Saturday night and didn't have any issues with slow service or inattentive waiters.  My wife and I each had a caesar salad with our prime steaks, she opting for the green beans and myself choosing the mashed potatoes.  The highlight of the meal was definitely the dessert, DO NOT pass up the chocolate cake!!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant and the food was good. Our service was good as well. A little on the pricey side but no complaints about the food or service. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"It's fine. Don't bother going here unless you're getting steak, and at that rate, drive a little further and go somewhere better for the price. We went during the Queens Dinner (3 courses, $30 a person). Had we gone at full menu price I would have been really irritated due to the pretty bad service and not-so-impressive expensive menu choices. Our waitress was really nice, but had tons of tables scattereed all over the restaurant for some reason.   Getting drinks took forever- minimally 20 minutes, it was 9:00 and not THAT busy. We also ordered a bottle of champagne that took 30 minutes to come back and let us know they were out. Another option was not suggested, and after we asked if they had champagne by the glass, the waitress said no, but we later found three options on the menu.  The food was pretty good, and like I said, if it wasn't the dinner special, it would have been far overpriced.  The 'show kitchen' is visibly dirty from the dining room. My fiance had the filet oscar which looked (and he confirmed) awesome. I had some unremarkable pasta thing.   Overall, it was fine. I've had much better food and MUCH better service for the price. This is a 2.5 star restaurant masquerading as a four. Inexperienced staff (we heard the special menu explained three completely different ways over the course of an hour, still not sure who's explanation was right, some people got five courses for the price, some got three, depending on the competence of the waiter) and somehow overworked (the waitress made a comment about the team not being cohesive that particular night). The delay between the bar and our waitress was ridiculous, and the menu price of the food was overpriced, but the awesomeness of the filet oscar saved the rating."}
{"text":"A series of disappointments. #1 We went there for the first time expecting elegance with soft background music. Not so.  #2 marinara sauce on the chicken parmesan was watery.  #3 companion's filet mignon was undercooked,  and \"corrected\" to inedible. #4 Our waiter was usually unavailable but waiters for other tables seemed available and attentive. Unfairly or not, a return is unlikely.  Not a good experience,  possibly not typical."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying this restaurant for years but it is not always top-of-the-mind now that North Meck has so many other dining options. I am so glad it jumped in to my brain when four of us decided to have a mid-week splurge. I arrived first so I enjoyed a beverage at the bar. Once eveyone arrived we were seated, and we all commented that we had forgotten how reasonable this restaurant is considering the quality. We always get the Combination (in various forms) and tonight it was the small filet with the crab cake. YUM! We also splurged on the wine - Duckhorn Merlot. I love their wine list! We had a wonderful dinner and we decided that we won't wait so long between visits!"}
{"text":"We went here for a rare date night.  We chose Mickey and Mooch as we wanted a high end steakhouse.  We had been here a couple times before with a decent meal. This time around although the service was good, the steaks were horrible.  I ordered a 12oz filet and my wife a 9 oz.  hers was ordered oscar style but came with three small pieces of cold lump crab. Her steak was also at least half the size of mine.  When we asked the wait staff about the size, they state it was a 9oz but size may differ (huh?). Additionally when we went here two years ago we experienced a very bad sewage smell near the bar on the way to the restroom. Two years later...it still smelled horrible. Very disappointing for the price, cleanliness and quality!"}
{"text":"Took the boyfriend to dinner for his birthday.  Although it was  Restaurant Week, I decided to just order a couple of appetizers - which I did simultaneously.  I ordered the onion rings and the crab cakes.  I asked about the size of the cakes to ensure they would be sufficient for a dinner.  Five 1 oz portions.  Good for me.  BUT why not tell me that they also come with a side of onion rings???  Both were fine.  Boyfriend got the salad wedge - which was delicious.  And the catch of the day - which was described as blackened.  It was barely seared, but well-cooked.  It also came with a bed of spinach.  Not being a fan, he asked for a substitute.  She said they couldn't do that, but he could order a separate side (at cost). The cheesecake was good!"}
{"text":"I visited M & M last weekend for nostalgic reasons.  It has been over 14 years since my last visit!   Pro- The food was great! I ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes, had their Caesar salad and carrot cake for dessert.  The steak was juicy, tender and prepared perfectly for a thick, NOT buttered flied cut (Medium well heat). Their mashed potatoes are my favorite! Lumpy, bumpy and buttery! Their Caesar needed a little more dressing which was a quick fix. I found out their carrot cake comes from Queen City Bakery! Wow! Yum! Rich and tastes homemade.   Con- Cleanliness of the restaurant. It is an older establishment which exceptions can be made but I was not very comfortable being sat in a booth where a spider jumped on us. The menu had old bread crumbs stuck to it. My bread plate and fork had old dried food from the dishwasher.  The  candles on the table haven't been wiped from food splatters and the washable white tablecloth still had a spot on it.  Guess I am a little picky by wanting to eat at a restaurant that takes the extra step to ensure both sides of the service is top notch."}
{"text":"Went during Restaurant week for an early Sunday dinner. Loved it!!  great service, even better food. Portions were more then enough. The only areas of improvement: 1)  fix the booth seats ( with something more then just tape), 2) be sure you have the right about of staffing to handle the job. Being someone who had worked in Food service for over 10 years, It hurt my heart to see the executive chef acting as a hostess and server."}
{"text":"High recommend restaurant have to go. ! Live relax music. Sweet cake make my day.very good"}
{"text":"The best meal I have had in a long time. Found this place by accident, great atmosphere, great service, great food and drinks.  Ordered the calamari as an appetizer, it was perfect. Had the special which was consisted of scallops, shrimp and sea bass. Also perfect! Quality costs but it's worth it. 2 appetizers, 2 martinis, 2 entrées and tip ran about 120$."}
{"text":"Absolute slop! High priced slop at that. Fine dining umm not here pass it by"}
{"text":"First and foremost I do not complain, so you know that this review is legitimate. Our steaks (cooked medium) were VERY UNDERDONE and the \"Oscar\" style came with COLD lobster meat. I would have much rather spent a lot less for a much better meal at many other restaurants."}
{"text":"This place has had its ups and downs in the past with change of owners/management I guess but for the most part has been really good. It's very nice and upscale inside but not stuffy which also has a nice patio overlooking a small lake. Not a huge menu but does have alot of variety for everyone. Although it is upscale, the prices are very reasonable especially for filet and lobster tails which is around a surprising $35. They also have prime meats which are more but still fair. The live music is also a plus in the piano bar area"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, my wife and I only come here during restaurant week, because spending a lot of money on dinner is not a priority of ours. We have only ever ordered the steak as it was recommended to us by many people and the two times we ate there, we were not disappointed, however it was not the best steak I have ever had at that price either.   It is probably one of the nicest restaurants in the Lake Norman area for a moderately expensive date night or to treat some corporate guests, but the location is something to be desired. It is in the middle of the Harris Teeter, Lowes, shopping plaza so how they have still kept their reputation for so many years in that setting is certainly a compliment to the quality of food they serve.   You will feel out of place in jeans and anything less than a collared shirt on a weekend here, so dress accordingly after all you are about to drop some coin."}
{"text":"Great place for a special occasion! lived in Huntersville for about 3 years and we decided to go in the middle of the week! It was awesome and food quality is incredible! Huge portions, enough for two people to eat on one plate!  Kind of expensive but compared to Melting Pot where you cook your own food, it's a better romantic deal!"}
{"text":"Stunningly mediocre. I had never had bland oysters before. The saltines that came with them were stale. I couldn't finish the beer the server recommended, and the steak required significant amounts of A1 to even attempt. The mashed potatoes were passable at best. Drive the extra ways into Charlotte to get a real steak or seafood dinner. Bleh."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've reviewed a restaurant but I've been thinking for a whole week, about my unfortunate experience last Wednesday. I previously had an underwhelming visits there about 6 months ago but figured I'd give it another go- maybe they just had off nights? Turns out I should've just stayed away.  The hubby and I came for dinner and sat at the bar. We were hyper-greeted by two different bartenders who couldn't seem to figure out who's customers we were. But over-service is good, right? As soon as drink orders were in they both forgot about us. We went through 2 drink rounds before we were even served bread. And finished that off before our dinner came- a salad for me and fish special for hubby. Took 34 minutes to get our food from placing the order.  Let's talk about the salad: I keep expectations at check when ordering a salad as I'm not going to have a heavenly filet mignon experience. But I did order their large salad with shrimp (which costs almost $20). What I got was an iceburg mix, 1 large mushroom cut into 4 pieces, 1 large tomato cut into 4 pieces, 4 slices of avocado and 4 shrimp grilled with no seasonings. My husband got a plate with 3 pieces of deep fried fish...nothing else on the plate. He also got a side bowl of greens- pretty yummy.  Our bill was $85 before tip- mostly because we had 2 martinis each waiting for the food which was horrible.  The other thing that was kind of off-putting was the whole demeanor of the staff. This locations is far less professional and inviting than the Charlotte location. We had one waitress who was singing in the corners, and then a waitress and the bartender were complaining about shifts. At any given time about 3 servers would be huddled at the hostess station, just hanging out. In fact several customers came in and the wait staff made them wait around until the hostess returned from wherever she kept disappearing to. Also- and this was harsh- a small group of the staff stood at the hostess station laughing and making fun of a young lady that had tried to walk her elderly family members to their car in the down-pouring rain. The poor girl looked like a drowned rat, but she was helping her grandparents, bless her heart. And the hostess and a few of the servers just watched, laughed and pointed. Kinda mean if you ask me.  Anyways, 3 strikes and I'm out. This place is a huge bummer and overall we spent almost $100 for a horrible time. Live and learn I guess"}
{"text":"Amazing place, You must go, always love the service and food. The mash potatoes are amazing"}
{"text":"A nice steakhouse but wasn't a standout for me.  I did enjoy the truffle fries and 7 layer cake.  I'd like to come back with a larger group so I can try more dishes."}
{"text":"Wow! Mickey and Mooch blew me away, great atmosphere, decent service, and absolutely amazing food. I ordered the Low country Crispy Flounder topped with Lump Crab Meat Remoulade....fantastic.  The flounder is fried in a light batter,just enough to give it a nice crunch, it's not greasy, but has just enough oil to make it really, really tasty. Flavored to perfection,the meat is so light and flaky, it's a pleasure to eat, without any of the guilt of chowing down on red meat.  You wouldn't even think about putting tartar sauce on this flounder, its just too good.  And then unexpectedly you will get a piece of the lump crab meat in with the flounder, and oh baby...the taste, its worth the drive to the Arboretum. As I drooled over my light yet tantalizing flounder, my attention was turned to the mashed potatoes which were taking up an inordinate amount of space on my plate, I'm talking about huge portions here.  And these potatoes were out of this world...simply delicious, with subtle butter and salt flavors, but not so much that it masked the natural fresh taste of the potatoes. And the best part is I experienced all of this decadent flavor for the very economic price of $15.95 at dinner, and that includes the salad.  My brother, it was his birthday celebration..Happy Birthday Matty! ordered the Charleston Shrimp and Grits, I only managed to scrounge a bite, but it was pretty good, and being a Chapel Hill boy I don't approve of just any bowl of grits with shrimp...but these were good, and once again the portions were mammoth...Matt also ordered a side of Mashed potatoes, and they brought him a heaping BOWL of potatoes...I don't know if it was because it was his birthday or what, but...... man.   Mickey and Mooch; great atmosphere, reasonable prices, and great food.  The entire restaurant has an elite vibe, without the snobbery.  Eat at this Place!"}
{"text":"For years we have infrequently enjoyed Mickey & Mooch, reserving our visits for special occasions. For my birthday Saturday, four of us ate there. First, even though we had a 7pm reservation, we weren't seated until 7:35pm, and the hostess seemed disorganized rather than helpful. Our waiter was inexperienced, perhaps new, and not very attentive (had to ask for water refills, more bread, etc.), and perhaps had too many tables to service. I had my favorites, bone-in ribeye, blue cheese cole slaw, and a shrimp cocktail.Others had grits with filet and fries. The food was good, but not as good as I recall it being. The fries were oily and the shrimp could have been cleaned better. We decided to skip dessert and go to Amalie's instead, even though the chocolate cake is also a favorite of mine. All in all, a disappointing experience, certainly not up to previous visits, and we will probably go elsewhere in the future. Too bad."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, as always! We had dinner with friends there a few weeks ago. We arrived early for our reservation and were seated right away. Our first  \"Fly by\" from our waiter was encouraging. I thought we were going to have a great experience. After that the service was simply awful! Even as the waiter admitted a problem he continued to say and do dumb things."}
{"text":"We went during restaurant week due to the quality of the menu options. We were greeted by the nice hostess but we were taken to the \"restaurant week section\" with 9 other tables and one server. He took everyone's order at the same time and we literally were there two hours to eat lack luster food. The bread was cold and the lobster was over cooked. The best thing they have is the she crab soup. I will never go there again . I have had a better at chili's."}
{"text":"If you want to pay for slightly overpriced bland food, come here. One of the specials on the night we went was Blackened Tilapia with five jumbo shrimp in some kind of sauce. The shrimp...ROCK HARD. The tilapia...tasteless. I mean not a pinch of salt!!!! Glad that wasn't mine. I had the shrimp and grits. Same ol' hard shrimp in a creole sauce. I don't think there's any salt (or any other seasonings) in the kitchen. Absolutely no flavor what so ever! None. That really made me sad. The grits were pretty good. Would have been nice to have more of them under my creole shrimp sauce. The was a live two-man band playing that evening. Not sure what the schedule is for live music. Also not sure if they were good or not. We could hardly hear because the speakers were busted in the room where we ate, and a few lights were out...Get it together Mickey. Our waitress was nice. That was a plus. They have a cool bar area. Would be nice to have a drink and listen to the band."}
{"text":"Left Firebirds to come here for Restaurant Week. Our server Dana was so great! She was sweet, eclectic, and funny. We ordered drinks, I had the Elder flower strawberry lemonade and my boyfriend the bday boy had a Corona Extra. Then he got the same drink as me. Our food came out in a spaced out fashion. First I had Crab soup, he had shrimp cocktail. Big shrimp, great soup. Bread came out. Crusty...Was room temp to cool, butter was sweet. It's ok, but not in the mood for it. Entrees came, salmon and pasta was great! Pasta was fresh pasta. Win! He had Crab cakes  (delish) and greens. He enjoyed them. Then dessert. He had carrot cake and I had the almond cake. OMG!!! Can you say amaretto???? Sooooooo good. Dana's suggestions were on point. Since our meal came with dessert, Dana asked if we would like to take a birthday dessert home. He didn't want the live band to sing happy birthday to him so Dana signed it to him. She's so sweet. She even offered to take pics of us. I don't live here but I would come just to talk to her. Good food and great experience."}
{"text":"I went here back in 2006, so I have no idea what it's like now.  That being said, I remember it so well I can write a review for this place 5 years later.  That's gotta mean something, eh?  I never knew how good grits could be until I tried them here.  Wow, creamy yet light and oh so filling.  I had the lamb, and the quality and the char on that lamb was spectacular.  I'm not a fan of wedge salads, but they make a damn good creamy house dressing.  The desserts were huge and fun too.  You know how you always wish there were more caramelized top to a Crème Brule?  They do it in a large, shallow ramekin, so there's more top to crack and enjoy.  One of the best things was the price.  It's was extremely reasonable by MN standards for this type of restaurant at that time.  MMmm, this place is such a fantastic memory of my fist visit south of the Mason-Dixon."}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal last night: 6oz filet and crab cake with a salad and braised cabbage sides.  My wife's tilapia with lump crab meat and sides of grits and blue cheese slaw was equally delicious.  The portions are generous as are the pours on the wine, which are promised at 6oz or more.  One glass for each of us was sufficient to get us through our entire meal. Thre bread and sweet butter were excellent as well."}
{"text":"I really wasn't that impressed.  Plastic table cloth and the place smelled kind funky too.  I got the bone in ribeye - and it definetely wasn't the best steak in the area.  Wine selection is rather lacking.  I'd hit the many alternatives before this; Flemings, Capital, Ruth..."}
{"text":"We came to Mickey and Mooch a couple months ago on a weekday evening and it was quite empty.  Nice cozy meal for us then!  My husband and I ordered two different pastas, while others in the group got chicken marsala and salmon (I think?).  The pastas we're pretty good, nice and creamy.  Here is my gripe, dinners come with a side.  Well that makes sense for the chicken and salmon to have sides, but for the pasta!?  What side am I going to want with pasta?  More pasta?  French fries?  Potatoes?  I ended up going  with broccoli, which was massive in size, but it is not needed and would not be missed if I wasn't given a side.  I'd rather have the broccoli in the pasta.   Another gripe, we were given bread at the beginning.  It was not warm and it is served with hard butter.  How are you supposed to spread that?  Either serve creamy butter or serve with hot bread...better yet, do both!  My favorite dessert is Oreo cheesecake and they had it there, it was quite good!  Others in my group enjoyed the chocolate cake and coconut cake.  Overall I would recommend, but the restaurant can make improvements.  Good place, but not great."}
{"text":"We come here about once a quarter and our food experience is always top-notch. For some reason we never think of it though when we are deciding where to eat; I think it's because of it's unprepossessing location in a mall parking lot.  It's menu is comprised of time-tested items: wedge salad, pasta, chicken, lobster, steak, etc. Solid comfort-food. The service is generally good: attentive but not overbearing.  The atmosphere can make a big difference in your experience. If you are there at a time when there is live music you will absolutely not be able to converse with someone at your table. The show is too intrusive and the acoustics work against hob-nobbing.  We tend to eat early, but the times when we are there after 7PM were not as pleasant for us as the times when there was no live music."}
{"text":"We came here for the second time the day before Valentine's Day. We had been here before and enjoyed the experience, but I probably would not have chosen to come here again if they were not listed on Open Table.   I am very glad we came back! The first time, we sat in a booth in the bar area. This time, we were seated in the main dining area to the right of the bar. Given that this was a romantic dinner, I definitely preferred being away from the kitchen.  We started with some before dinner drinks. I ordered the Gin Basil Smash and my fiancée ordered the ... something with Rose as the second word. I really can not remember the name. Mine was delicious! If a Mojito and a Gin and Tonic had a baby, it would be a Gin Basil Smash. And it went perfectly with The Love Apple which we got as our appetizer. The Love Apple is the standard tomato, basil, mozzarella salad but stacked instead of thrown onto a plate. Their balsamic was exceptional.  For our entrees, I ordered the Fried Cod with the Loaded Mashed Potatoes and she ordered the Salmon and Crab Cake combination with the Braised Cabbage and Bacon. They must bread the Cod with something from another planet because the breading was incredible! It was not there to merely coat the fish, it was there to add an amazing amount of flavor! And the fish was tender. The Loaded Mashed Potatoes were huge! Just look at the pictures. Huge! I was not able to try the Crab Cake (darn crab allergy) but my fiancée said it was very good. I did try the Salmon and it was cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. The Braised Bacon and Cabbage was also very good. I wish I could make cabbage taste that good...  On top of the great food, the service was wonderful. We had two ladies who took turn serving us. They were both knowledgeable and fun. This is definitely a great spot for a date night."}
{"text":"Went with a friend and ordered a prime filet medium rare. Came out medium well. Friend ordered filet and 3 lobster tails. Filet over cooked lobster tails looked more like craw dad tails. Served with olive oil no butter. The price was in line with a high end steak house. the food was not even in the same ball park.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Waited here on a waiting list for two hours for basically a steak. People here seem to be very ignorant, they see a bunch of people waiting to eat and they are sitting there doing nothing but talking and not even ordering anything.  The lady in the front is very nice  she gave us a 25 dollar card for the wait. I might give it another shot with a reservation and see. But fist impression not the greatest"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to Micky & Mooch since they opened in the arboretum. We've been thru a few ups and downs over the years but for the past year or more it's been fantastic.  The seared peppercorn  tuna appetizer is one of the best deals around, and they serve a very generous portion of high-quality tuna! The new management and staff are attentive to the details and the food has been outstanding. We find it being one of the best steak houses in CLT. All the portions are huge making the restaurant a great value. And... the bar makes an ice cold big martini!  Keep it up guys, good job!"}
{"text":"Arboretum ooh Arboretum  My family and I frequent the Arboretum for shopping at places like Bed Bath & Beyond as well as Walmart and Michaels. We decided to slow drive through the entire lot on both sides to see what else was offered and ran across a couple restaurants. I immediately took to YELP to see some pics and read some review highlights to determine if we were going to try out any of the restaurants. After looking this place up I saw so many ups and downs in opinions and decided that we needed to down our own opinion and give this place a try and what better time to do so than Queens Fest Week as I've read how pricy this place can be.  The food was decent and edible, the service sucked as the server was very distant and unattentative. We had to nearly stand up to get his attention and get him to come over to refill water or to pick up finished dishes. The add on cost were ridiculous during Queens Fest. It caused the 3course meal to only be about $4 less than ordering from the regular menu which isn't really a deal in my opinion as a restaurant enthusiast who knows a deal when I see one or am experiencing one.   I honestly enjoyed my dish which was the crab cakes and having lived in MD for 2 years I know a GENUINE crab cake when I see and taste one. The string beans were also extremely tasty and you get a LOT. My husband had the filet scampi which was a filet mignon topped with shrimp scampi and he didn't leave any behind LoL. My daughter had lobster tails which was one of the upgrade cost and she wasn't full from it as she LOVES food and thought she was on a cruise at the Captain cocktail party where you get unlimited lobster tails LoL. For dessert my daughter again upgraded cost to get the chocolate cake which she is still raving about. I had carrot cake and my husband had the cheesecake. We all had dessert as leftovers and also the string beans as they give you a LOT on the side. My daughter had grits left over as well as that was the side she had with her lobster tails.   The amount of sides offered and the type of sides offered is pretty slim which is another caveat in conjunction with the overpricing.  Overall, if the service didn't SUCK I wouldn't mind spending the extra money to have dinner here once in a while. The hubby thinks we should try again in the future and hope for the best. If anything changes I'll be sure to update my review"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, a party of 12 of us descended upon Mickey & Mooch to celebrate the birthday of one of our fair maidens.  Based on the restaurant's décor and lavish entrance, I was surprised to open my menu and found that the pricing on items were pretty reasonable, considering.  I had expected entrees to be higher priced.  However, we soon found that \"lower\" prices come with many consequences.    Drinks:  After 30 minutes of being seated, some were still waiting for their beverages.  When they finally received their bottles of beer, they were \"as is.\"  No glass.  What kind of \"upscale\" restaurant serves beer without a glass?  We weren't sitting at the bar; we were in the dining room.  One of the beers was a Blue Moon brought in its bottle.  Don't the bartenders know that Blue Moon is always traditionally served with an orange slice?  It's like serving a lime with a Corona.  Someone else ordered a martini.  It was sloshed around as it was set down in front of him.  He had to wipe up the spillage by himself.    Bread:  Bread was served but it was cold (like it was taken out of a freezer and not fully thawed).  They asked to have the half-frozen bread taken away and replaced with \"warm\" bread at least twice; it never came during the entire two and a half hours we were there.    Salads:  We asked if we could get something besides a regular garden salad.  Our server advised a Caesar salad or Wedge in its place.  We were never told that there was a significant upcharge to getting a slightly different salad.  $2.95 for the Caesar, $3.95 for the Wedge..the same cost if you ordered them separately.  When this was brought to the attention of our server at the end of the meal, he brushed it off.  I'm guessing it happens a lot at the restaurant.   The salads arrived & we had to ask for silverware (for the 2nd time).  Several minutes passed and I finally got up and swiped them off an empty table.  Minutes after we had started using the newly acquired silverware and eating our salads, the server finally returned...with ONE set of silverware.  I guess we were supposed to share?  Entrees:  Our entrees arrived halfway through the salads.  After delving into the entrees, several people had puzzled looks on their faces.  Some had ordered their steaks medium rare or medium.  They came out with raw meat in the middle.  And not just a small portion; it was golfball-sized.  Medium rare means pink with some reddish tones; not raw.  Worse, one person ordered pork.  It, too, had a golfball-sized red raw center.  Trichinosis, anyone?  At this point, we called over a manager.  When the raw pork was displayed to her, she tried to tell us that it was \"fat.\"  Red fat?  In the middle of a pork cut?  Being served the raw pork is one thing.  Passing it off as acceptable by a manager is poor crisis management.  All of the undercooked meats were taken away to \"re-cook\" or replace.  The steaks were returned within a few minutes; the pork wasn't.  With the plates that were taken away for the steaks were the side items that everyone had ordered.  These were not returned on the plates and had to be \"re-ordered\" by us specifically requesting them from the server and/or manager.   One friend ordered drawn butter with his salmon.  It didn't come until he was halfway through the salmon, about 15 minutes later.    Halfway through my meal, I finished my glass of wine and ordered another glass.  It didn't come until I was through with my entrée and the plate had been cleared.  Great timing...and I'm not a fast eater.   After everyone finished eating and plates were cleared, the \"new\" pork finally arrived.    Bill:  Did I mention the Wedge salad that was on my bill after everything we went through and it was brought to the attention of the server that we were never advised about the upcharge?  After all our problems, getting the bill with all the additions was like a kick in the head after being punched in the stomach for a couple of hours.    Summary:  I'm just telling you the story from my side of the table.  I don't even know everything that went on at the other side of the 12-person table.  I only gathered stories here and there.  It wasn't just one error.  It was one after another.  It wasn't just one person at the table.  It was practically everyone who had a problem.  When the numerous errors were brought to their attention, the errors were not handled in an appropriate manner by the waitstaff or the management team.  The biggest problem of the night was that nobody seemed to care whether we had a poor experience or not.  The kicker was that afterwards I wrote a 3-page letter to Mickey & Mooch corporate...and got no response.  They apparently didn't care either.  So I guess they won't care if I take my money elsewhere.   The End.  Happily Never After."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant (Arboretum location) and choose it over 131 Main every time. The prices are a little lower and the food is better! Filets always have great flavor, and the loaded mashed potatoes and green bean sides are delicious! Sometimes the wait can be long, but the bar is first come first serve. One time, our reservation did get messed up while my parents were in town. That sucked, a lot, but we were eventually seated. We will continue to return to Mickey and Mooch."}

{"text":"Reservations was at 9:00pm however we weren't seated until a 9:20 due to the party before was still lingering. Other than that, the food was amazing. Of course restaurant Week we took advantage of that... I had the steak and greens. Waiter was great and very attentive. He was very patient. Food was seasoned and amazing. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Servers were rude, managers were even more rude, spilled red wine on me and didn't even apologize.  Food was very overpriced and cooked terribly, steak was burnt to a crisp and nearly inedible.  My whole party agreed it was an awful experience.   Never again."}
{"text":"The food has no flavor here...this is my first review! Do not waste your money. I came with a large group so it took a while, but I have no complaints about the server-she was great. But the food is for people that don't care for taste. DO NOT COME HERE!!! Overrated and over priced. Run forest run!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing ... can't go wrong with anything. Ribs, pasta, steak all the sides! Wine, thumbs up. My favorite bartender isn't there anymore I really miss him, justin was great; knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"This place just ROCKS! A bit pricey, but you truly get what you pay for. The food is awesome, the menu has a ton of great dishes. The live music was great. My girlfriend and I went during restaurant week. We went to the arboretum location.  Check out their menu. From top to bottom, it all tastes great. Wish I could afford to go there weekly  :)"}
{"text":"Extremely tasty! Tastes the wedge salad, grits, cabbage, chilean sea bass and lobster bisque soup.  All very good.  A bottle of shiraz for only $19!!  Can't top that.  Will certainly return if not frequent this spot.  Very affordable for the quality of food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary celebrations. Although we had made reservations, it took about 30 min to seat us. The waiters changed on a couple of times in the beginning, so there was a little confusion, but nothing inconvenient. We loved all the food we ordered, especially the crab soup! The fish was also perfect, and so was the layered choclate cake! I recommend the place for an occasion, but otherwise its a little pricey."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last Friday night and it was amazing , BUT this evening I went for a drink , I had an appointment and waited for my check for 15 minutes , then I went to pay and the bar didn't have a till , I only had cash , the wonderful barmaid tried 3 times to get a manager for another 15 minutes , he was very rude , I finally told her I had to go and she was very upset , she said she would lose her job so I went to the manager myself to settle my check , he ignored me for 10 more minutes and I finally had to get rather stern and he decided he couldn't speak English , he was very RUDE and took my money and came back 10 minutes later , I tried to explain I had an appointment and he asked me to leave and dismissed me like a child , he was very ugly to me and the bartender , I spent $500 on the Friday before and over a $11.37 bill I wasn't almost an hour trying to pay , I won't EVER go Back !!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best carrot cake I have ever put in my mouth.  Tuna app as an entree is perfect."}
{"text":"I believe that Mickey & Mooch is the best value per $ in the LKN area.  No,  I'm not saying it's a cheap place to dine, but it is a good value.  The baby lobster tails to the steaks to the sides (Bleu Cheese Coleslaw, Mashed Potatoes, etc.), to the wonderful wedge salad is all very good.  I do have to say my absolute favorite dish there is the Shrimp and Grits.  Bring a healthy appetite for this one, add ridiculous amounts of Tabasco and you're all set!  Finally, if that wasn't enough they serve ginormous pieces of cake for dessert.  The chocolate is very good, but for me the carrot cake is amazing!  Only negative would be how loud it is.  Every time I'm there it's very noticeable and makes going with a large group difficult because you can't hear from one end of the table to the other."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 8:00pm but when we got to the restaurant they had no record of it. To their credit, they sat us immediately......but didn't seem to believe us. Food was wonderful as always. Lump crab and spinach salad. Service was very very slow.  We've been done with our meal for 15 minutes and no one has been by to check on us.  I think it's just our server because the tables beside us are getting a lot of attention."}
{"text":"Excellent food to match excellent service.  I had previously looked inside and liked what I saw so I took an opportunity to book a reservation for a quiet night out for a 1st date. I was looking for some place that was cozy, quiet and would allow us to meet and get to know each other comfortably. For once, I got exactly what I wanted and I have to say that the atmosphere helped to set a great mood for such a nice night. The waiter was knowledgeable and very helpful. Polite and professional! He made us feel right at home. And the food was incredible. Exactly as he described so there was no surprises. The flavor was exquisite and the portion was large enough to justify the price. I was quite satisfied and looking forward to another night out at Mickey & Mooch's again soon."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in South Charlotte is Mickey and Mooch.  We've dined there for special occasions (just the two of us) and hosted and attended parties for 35 or more and have always had wonderful service and our guests always rave about the food.  The chef and the owners will occasionally visit your table and you'll find it difficult to get a better steak at any other restaurant in Charlotte.  Great food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Used to be pretty good food, but service has always been an issue...my last visit here was not good. Food quality is sub par."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times - a couple of times for business meetings and the other times, just meeting up with friends.  I have to say that the service has been really hit or miss on our visits.     The atmosphere is nice - sort of upscale without being too stuffy.  They have a piano in the bar area and on most visits, they had someone playing, which is a nice touch.   On our most recent visit, David and I met a friend for dinner and we had a really nice server who was very attentive.  She didn't know much about the wine menu, but that seems to be fairly common in our experience these days. (Still, we find it  very disappointing in a place that bills itself as an \"upscale restuarant\"!)  The food was fairly good but a little on the pricey side.     While this is not my first choice when we are planning a night out, I can usually find something I like on the menu - they usually have at least one or 2 fish entrees for the non-meat eaters like myself.      David said that he prefers the Mickey & Mooch up at LKN - he thinks that the food & service is better there.  I haven't eaten at the Lake Norman location though, so I can't compare the two."}
{"text":"Not from the area, so took a chance based on other reviews. We were pleased with our experience.   We started the meal with two wedge salads -- which actually served three very nicely. Entrees included pork chop served Saltimbocca -- chop was cooked perfectly and the sauce was very tasty, Chilean Sea Base with a light butter sauce -- also cooked to our liking, last was a filet mignon with scallops -- perfect.  Side dishes were also very good and portions were very large -- Collards, Broccoli and Braised Cabbage. Portions are ample -- we had leftovers!  Wine list was good...had our favorites."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. The ambiance, the food, the prices. I would give it 5 stars but the service was a little slow for my liking. PERFECT for special occasions. Fancy feel but the prices aren't astronomical. For 28$ I got filet and a crab cake with a huge side order of collard greens and a side salad!!"}
{"text":"I went during Queen's Feast, Charlotte's version of Restaurant Week, so my response may not reflect the usual dining experience at M&M. I liked the place, but I don't know if I'd go back again. Their portions are HUGE, and their menu is pretty extensive, though full of typos. I got a mussel appetizer in white wine sauce, and it was equal to most place's mussel entrees. At the same time, my mother ordered a crab fritter entree that wasn't nearly as huge. I think some more indications on the menu regarding size would be useful.   The main entree I got, a Chilean sea bass and shrimp in beurre blanc sauce, was very tender. I thought it was reasonably sized but dwarf-like in comparison to the other courses, including the side items. When you ordered the chef's broccoli, it's pretty much the same size as the produce section's broccoli. Good if you're hungry, but I was overwhelmed. Be sure to try their wedge salad with blue cheese and special dressing-that was my favorite part of the whole meal.  Our party agreed that the service is a little unfriendly and a bit impatient. The server we had for the evening seemed annoyed with having to bring out boxes or extra knives. While the atmosphere is dignified but not stuffy, our waiter seemed a little pompous.  Though there's a piano there, our dinner group heard party favorite hits. It seemed kind of out of place having sea bass and hearing Michael Jackson.  The portions for the price is the big draw."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely terrible! The food was mediocre at best! 1/10 will not be back. I will stick to the Huntersville location"}
{"text":"Dined here last night.    The food was probably three and a half to four star.   We tried the filet mignon, which was cooked fine, and had a deliciously fresh flavor.   The side of mashed potatoes was fine, but too much for one person.   The she crab soup was excellent.     The service was simply atrocious.    We had a reservation, and were seated within five minutes of our time.  (We arrived from out of town and were a few minutes late, but they accommodated nicely).   However, once we got to the table our waitress just seemed to forget about us.   It took thirty minutes just to get our order in.    She kept disappearing for at least twenty minutes at a time, and as a result, we were still eating our dinner at 11:00pm.    For the dessert, it took nearly twenty minutes at that late hour to go and find three plates of dessert??!   She was polite and nice to us whenever she showed up, and we just didn't say anything.    Folks all around us had long been seated, served, and completed their meals in half the time it took us.    If you charge these kinds of prices, part of what you expect is good service.   Heck, ANY kind of service would have been nice.    Don't think we will come back unless we plan an entire day for a meal."}
{"text":"We are becoming regulars at M&M.  We always have friendly knowledgeable servers and if you drink, beverages are a heavy pour.  Even for top shelf! But I'm writing because my entree was delivered not as ordered.  It was the special blackened halibut and I asked for it not to be blackened. Our waitress was very apologetic and expressed that she forgot to ask for \"not blackened\".  A few minutes later, a freshly prepared fillet was delivered just the way I like it: lightly crusty outside and opaque in the center.  Then chef owner Mickey came out and apologized as well and comped my entree.  Very thoughtful and generous. He explained that he got to use this incident as a teaching experience for his cooks.  I found that impressive since I've been cooking for over 30 years and it was great to hear chefs are still teaching. A great place to hang out at night and dance to live music, good food and drinks and friendly staff. Nice package,"}
{"text":"We are definitely regulars. The food is outstandingly good and very consistent. They have wait staff who remembers us, knows our taste in wine and always has excellent recommendations. Mickey himself seems to always be there, running the kitchen and making delicious items.   Just can't say enough good things about this one!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Chivken Marsala was garbage. I've cooked better at my house. Marsala gravy? What the heck is that? Just reduce the wine. It ain't rocket science. Asparagus not grilled? Really? Creme brûlée was fair at best. Dirty martini was good so there's that. No return. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The Underdog Wins Again...  When you think of classy, elegant, upscale and romantic steakhouses, most people would have to go pretty far down the list before they got to Mickey and Mooch.  Why that's the case, I'll never know?!  Most people seem to think and talk about places such as Ruth Chris, Del Frisco's and Capital Grill all the time, while Mickey and Mooch goes seemly forgotten.  Its like Mickey and Mooch is the underdog of steakhouses in the Charlotte area.  With that being said, I had the opportunity to go here last night (Thursday) to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday.  We walked in through the revolving doors to find the bar very lively but otherwise the restaurant wasn't crowded at all.  We were taken directly to a booth on the right side of the restaurant.  Our booth was very cozy and comfortable.  After being seated a polite and cordial waitress came and took our drink and appetizer orders - mini lump crab cakes.  Soon thereafter, we placed our dinner order.  My gf ordered the 9oz. fillet with collard greens and mashed potatoes as her two sides.  I ordered the salmon and lump crab cake with fries and a side Caesar salad.    Our appetizer arrived fairly quickly and was fairly tasty. The plate was covered in a sweet \"mystery\" sauce. My gf and I are still trying to figure out what the sauce was... perhaps a hollandaise sauce. The mini crab-cakes were delicious and tender. Soon thereafter my crispy Caesar salad arrived and was nothing short of spectacular.  It was fresh, full of cheese, and it was served on a cold plate.   When our entrees arrived no more than 5-10 minutes later, both my girlfriend and I were extremely pleased with our meals. My salmon was tasty, cooked perfection, tender and moist! There is nothing worse than over cooked salmon. Oh, and I can't forget the fries! Let's just say McDonald's has nothing on these fries... crispy, golden...delicious. As for my girlfriend, she thought her steak was prepared to her specifications. She is an avid collard green connoisseur and absolutely loved the way they were seasoned. Her mashed potatoes were good as well but she didn't particularly like that the skin was not peeled off the potatoes prior to being mashed.   All in all, Mickey and Mooch is like the Giants of football... it keeps winning despite competing against \"supposedly\" superior options. You can take the Ruth's Chris and Capital Grilles of the world all you want.  I'm more than willing to dine at Mickey and Mooch and am confident I will come out with a delicious meal every time! This under dog is truly a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"We went for queens feast.  Paid up charge to get scallops which were VERY gritty.  Then dessert ran out.  Offered us an alternative and got up charged for that.  Complained about scallops to Owner and he did nothing but make excuses.  Won't be back.  Very disappointing"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my all time favorites in the Charlotte area.  I mean they are consistently perfect!  I've never had a bad meal, and I've been here several times over the years.  The she crab soup, crabcakes, tilapia, crab fritters, fresh pasta, catfish, flounder are all wonderful, but ALWAYS get the braised cabbage because it is the bomb diggity!  I've never tried the dessert because I'm always too full for those 5 layer slices of cake they offer, but they do look good."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times for my wife's Christmas parties. Both times the service was great and the food was really good as well. There was a live band playing which was nice. I enjoyed the decor and ambiance. We will be back."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for a birthday celebration dinner to try it as we are new to the area.  We started with the Charleston Crab soup which was delicious.  It was flavorful and rich and a perfect starter to our meal.  For our entrees the birthday boy had rack of lamb which looked amazing.  My hubby had the pork chop and said it was moist and delicious.  He ordered the braised cabbage and bacon as his side.  I had the petite filet and crab cake dinner.  My filet was cooked to perfection and the crab cake was awesome!  No fillers, just a moist yummy cake with chunks of crab....exactly what a crab cake should be!  For his birthday dessert, my cousin chose the carrot cake.  I've never seen such a huge piece of cake!!!  It was so yummy, I would highly recommend any of the dishes we ordered.  Our waiter was wonderful, the service was excellent.  We will definitely come back and will recommend it to anyone looking to have a delicious meal, excellent service and an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"This place has gone waaaaayyyyyyyyy down hill.  I would've given this place 5 stars just a few years ago, but not anymore!  We took my son here last night for his Birthday.  We walked into the restaurant asking for a table of 6 and were immediately asked if we had a reservation.  When we told them no the hostess informed us that it would be a LONG time before they could seat us.    Normally this is understandable (with no reservation) but as we looked around the restaurant it was 1/2 empty.  There was absolutely no reason for the wait.  Just as we were about to leave we were seated.  The waitress was actually excellent.  She greeted us immediately, recommended dishes and drinks, and took very good care of us.  But unfortunately that was it for the good points.... the restrooms were filthy and stinky, the food was average at best, the crab cakes tasted \"fishy\", and the salmon wasn't flaky at all. $300 for dinner and the only thing we enjoyed was the chocolate cake and whipped butter & bread.  Simply amazed at how badly this place has declined.  We won't be back!"}
{"text":"First time at Mickey &Mooch...... I would say it was ok . My favorites was the bread, good portion for a side,desert. The bad the food was not cooked right steak mid rare ,salad dressing wrong, and food luke warm. Our server Charles was  very good!!!!. I would recommend it for drinks and the bar menu."}
{"text":"Good food and solid service. Love the salad with goat cheese!! It was a good night and I am looking forward to returning altho its a bit too pricey."}
{"text":"Three of us ate here tonight. Not a great experience. 15 minutes for drinks and one was wrong. 5 min for a cold glass for the beer. Calamari was over fried and used stale oil - taste was poor. Scallops were overlooked and tasted like burned butter. Wait staff was good (Charles) and service was good. Asparagus side dish was too large - wasted food. Salads were good. But for the high prices I expected more quality."}
{"text":"Big menu. Ok food. No real style to the restaurant decor. It feels old to me. It's very popular in Huntersville, but it's not my favorite by any stretch."}
{"text":"We went here for Mothers Day and had a reservation for 2:15pm (we arrived early). Our waitress was Tammy. She told us about the specials they were having. We all ordered and when it came to my moms meal, she wanted a baked potato which is on menu and Tammy asked if she wanted the butter, bacon cheese etc on it so she ordered it loaded (never once was told about extra costs)Tammy told us they wouldn't be ready until 3 and she could hold our meal from coming out until then and we said no.   Instead she got the mashed potatoes which Tammy said she could get the same way as the baked potato - still never told about extra charge. We waited over 45+ minutes for our food to come out and it was after 3 when it arrived and we thought they were going to give my mom the baked potato since it was after 3. Nope. The portions are huge and the food is excellent which is why this review is getting three stars.  We receive the bill and notice that there is a charge for $3.95 for mashed potatoes. We thought that was odd since it came with my moms meal. We asked our waitress and she replied \"yes, that's the cost for it being loaded\" $3.95 for the toppings ?! I will also attach pics of the toppings so you can see what $4 will get you on your mashed potatoes. We wouldn't have been upset in any way if we were notified before ordering but instead she never told us. The wait was also extremely long and we watched others get their food before us. We will probably be back but will not be for a while nor will it be for a holiday."}
{"text":"Great place to meet singles 50 and up.  Their menu bores me as it never changes and is limited. I do love their crab cakes."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Mickey and Mooch. The boyfriend and I decided to stop in Saturday night to cap off restaurant week. I had read all of the reviews on Yelp many times for this place and was hesitant to give it a shot. However I'm glad we did!! The boyfriend can be a little snobby about restaurant but even he gave this one 2 thumbs up.   We both ordered a steak and they were both cooked to perfection. He even went so far as to say he liked it better than Ruth's Chris Steakhouse!! That's a glowing compliment since when we went there he thought it was the best lol.  I know some previous reviewers and even my mom have said service here is bad but we had great service. The ambiance is a little lacking but honestly it's not that bad and the food more than makes up for it. He got the filet fondue as an app and I got a salad. I highly suggest that if you are getting bacon on your salad (that or walnuts are the options), you try the house dressing which is a honey mustard bacon concoction that our waiter said he could drink right out of the bottle. It was good I will admit that but not quite as good as he thought it was haha. For our sides I got green beans (shocker) and he got loaded mashed potatoes. Both were good!!   I was a little disappointed with the desserts. They were out of the almond amaretto cake I Wanted to try so I got the cheesecake and it was okay. He got the tiramasu and he loved it but that's one of his favs.    The only thing that threw me was the guy in the bar area with the DJ. He was singing and dancing around (it was very club like) and I felt it was rather out of place. I don't know if this is a usual occurance or if it was a special night. I would expect maybe some rat pack piano playing type music or something with a name like Mickey and Mooch!! However I  will definitely suggest trying this place out and we will be back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant hands down. My Special occasion go to!   Had bday dinner here this weekend and it never disappoints"}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday and the food was horrible. The best thing was the loaded mash potatoes. Over priced for the food served. Waiter barely came back to the table to check on us so we had to get other waiters to do her job. Waiters were drinking on the job and actually gave two guests wine glasses that they were drinking out of and just filled up with whatever they put their hands on. Do not dine here if looking for an upscale experience."}
{"text":"We ate here on July 15, 2014.  This location has slipped and here's why.  Here's a list of everything that went WRONG:  1. The table was not clean when we arrived.  WE had to clean it. 2. The Long Island Iced Tea was not made correctly.  (I know because I am a bartender.) 3. The waiter bringing the wine did not know that Chardonnay is white and Malbec is red.  4. The wait for the wine was over ten minutes. 5. The loaded potato that we ordered came cold and with the incorrect ingredients on top. 6. The collards that we ordered were lukewarm. 7. The filet we ordered as medium well came to the table as medium/medium rare. 8. The ribs we ordered were dry. 9. Food presentation was unprofessional. 10. Finally, the bill was incorrect and we had to find someone to fix it.  We ended up asking the hostess to fix it.   The only good thing?  The salad.  Other things we noticed:  The hostess seemed to be picking up the slack for several waiters. A table near us waited 20 minutes before a waiter came, which is unprofessional as there were only four tables in the section with customers and the rest of the restaurant was not busy.  Unfortunately, this restaurant used to be better.   Now, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you eat at steakhouses, then you will understand the value at this place...specifically for Filet Mignon. The cuts are great (no real need to upgrade the cut, prime Angus is fine) and consistently cooked to correct temp. All the staff is pretty good, but if you get Nick or Matthew as your server, they will take excellent care of you! Tell them you saw Ajay's review of them online!   Front of the house staff (hostess and bar tender, Dave) are all amazing and again, you have to understand the value in comparison to a Capital Grille (which I also love.)  I eat here quite a bit and have yet to have much of an issue with anything, which tells me that they are doing much better than their current rating on yelp. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Visiting friend down in North Carolina and was trying to find a steakhouse. My friend said let's check out Mickey & Mooch. Someone had recommended this place.   Here is my review on the food.  Appetizer ordered the mussels with white wine sauce which tasty and delicious. We used up all the bread and soaked up the wine sauce which demonstrates how good this appetizer was. Fresh mussels for sure. Large portions enough to be shared by two people.  Entree- The salmon combo fillet. Really like the taste of the apricot glaze on the salmon. Fillet cooked just right. The broccoli was a little hard. I am used to totally cooked broccoli- like it well done.  My friend selected the lobster fillet and was pleased with the way the lobster was cooked.  Creamy, buttery mash potato just melts in the mouth.  The chocolate cake which they said was a small turned out to be a big portion enough for three. So decadent and yummy.   Will definitely come back again for drinks for they have a nice bar area."}
{"text":"A hard call to go to being a fan as Mickey & Mooch is truly A-OK.  It is classy but not dressy, but for a prom date or special occasion dressy dress would fit in OK.  The menu is masterful.  There is a great selection of appetizers, a couple of which would be a meal.  There is a large amount of seafood, chicken and ribs, steaks and chops, Italian...they really cover the meal territory.  Service we have had with just the two of us and on other occasions with a four adult and three grandchildren table is excellent.  No problems and between the wait staff and kitchen they staged the time for dishes to arrive so you could finish drinks, do one course and then another without feeling pushed or rushed.  Good job.  The steaks have been great.  Not big dessert people, we did have creme brulee which was excellent.  Certainly worth a try for a special event but call ahead so they are prepared for you table and wait staff-wise."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, this is probably one of your better/more upscale dining options outside of Birkdale for Huntersville/Cornelius. It's a nice establishment, although it can get a little crowded and loud during busy times. I've enjoyed the steak and lobster. I think next time though I will get a different side item besides the green beans, they are lacking something. My favorite thing to have here is carrot cake. They give you enough of it for four people so you can be sure to share or take home leftovers.:-)"}
{"text":"This was my first and last time here. The minute we walked in, the restaurant smelled musty. We were seated at a window booth table. Throughout dinner there were several ants seen crawling across the top of the booth as well as flies and other flying bugs. The crab soup was loaded with crab but was cold when served, the bitter for the bread was frozen with ice still in it, I ordered a medium filet and it was served black and blue....they tried to heat it up which resulted in a dried out filet. We voiced our concerns but never once saw a manager stop by the table....we were the ONLY table in the restaurant at 5:00....such a disappointment and disgust for our anniversary dinner! Don't waste your time or money on this place!"}
{"text":"Food good.  Coconut shrimp and cod.  Waiter sucks and trying to get out of here before the band starts back.  She is so off key I can't believe it."}
{"text":"I am not really sure how I should rate this place. We went here with friends that recommended M&M we had reservations and there were 6 in our party 4 adults and 2 preteens. Our friends let the waiter know that they would be buying the drinks. We ordered adult beverages and 2 of us ordered the cucumber gin drink which was supposed to have crushed black pepper as part of the description. It don't have it and our waiter went and got the peppermill and did it for us. We ordered 4 appetizers mussels, beef, tuna and something else. So far so good. While waiting we ordered our entrees figuring that we had waited long enough after ordering our apps. Next thing you know we have our salads being delivered not the apps that we had waited at least 20 minutes for. The people serving us had know idea whose salad was whose again not a big deal but we cancelled the apps. The couple we were with ordered some grilled shrimp because they were going to share a surf and turf my wife ordered the lamb medium and I ordered the scallops. When our food came out it was once again whose is whose. The lamb was raw, the scallops while cooked perfectly where in a sauce that was not a sauce and our friend didn't get her shrimp. Lamb goes back and we wait for the shrimp. The meal does come and it was decent. We ordered desserts and again who ordered what. Keep in mind none of our food was served by our waiter. Overall it seems like a nice place. The waiter and management were sincerely apologetic concerning everything. We then get our bills and the first time the waiter had wine on our bill so he had to rerun the tab. We were comped desserts which was fine and we asked to see the manager and explained the whole of the experience to her. She took the bill and comped us for the whole dinner. The manager apologized and asked us to please come back and give them another chance which we will do.  I am not sure who dropped the ball but I can bet it won't happen again. I will update my rating next time we eat there. I think overall the food was decent we just had that table. M&M thanks for the dinner and we would have gladly paid our check because it wasn't about the money. We will give you another shot based on how you handled the situation"}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is failing: stale  bland bread, salad with hard ribs and stale nuts that would be served at any fast food restaurant, tasteless entrees...and all served with cheesy cruise ship music.   The only upside it it has top-shelf liquor.    Avoid unless you want to just get drunk."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I celebrated Valentine's day here tonight. What a great experience! I was greeted so pleasantly at the door and was seated right away. The hostess took me to what she said was her \"favorite table\", even though they were very busy. Our server Bethany was great at describing the specials and helped guide us through the menu to make the perfect selection. I had the salmon and filet plate and everything was cooked perfect. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot at the Arboretum for a date night or dinner with friends. Low lights and cozy booths make it a comfortable atmosphere. Wine selection is good but the specialty cocktails are tasty.    The steaks are perfectly cooked and can be cut with a spoon. I recommend the wedge salad which can be split, any size filet and the Charleston statue shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"We went during restaurant week and had 9pm reservations.. We arrived a half hour early but we were seated right away in a romantic corner booth. The service was excellent by Tammy and our food was so delicious. Lobster tempura was divine... Crab bisque was some of the best we ever had and the scallops in brown butter sauce were cooked to perfection. It was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week had the Charleston crab soup, white truffle fries, crab cakes with bleu cheese coleslaw, key lime torte, and of course a taste of everyone's dishes at my table. Overall it was a nice experience but the portions were very heavy especially the side dishes...they literally were entree size making it a bit overwhelming to enjoy the entree. The food was also a little too bland for my taste, but I would recommend the Charleston crab soup and lump crab cakes - you can definitely taste real crab meat in both and those actually had a lot of flavors!   Do try: white truffle fries, Charleston crab soup, lump crab cakes, white chocolate raspberry cheesecake   Don't try: wasn't a fan of the steaks I tried here, mashed potatoes, bleu cheese coleslaw"}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on with some of these negative reviews.  We've been coming here for years and the food is consistently awesome.  We were just there on Friday night and had a wonderful experience.  The collard greens were some of the best I've ever had.  The service was A+.  I will agree with some of the reviews that the tablecloths need to be replaced and the booths need to be re-covered.  The atmosphere is better at night because of the huge windows letting in too much light.  If they fix the tablecloths and the booths I'll up my rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner. Music nights are very nice. Food is always fantastic. My favorite is the tuna and side item cabbage. Fun with friends or or date."}
{"text":"Excellent steak and large portions.  Very underpriced for the quality and portion size."}
{"text":"We had heard many positive comments about this restaurant. We went there with a oarty of 13. It was not busy. Our waiter was unusually bad. We had to ask multiple times for refills of water, he did not tell us the specials, and the final straw was he did not give complete change on the bill. The waiter felt he had the right to roound up tge bill and give the change. We were already playing a 20% gratuity.  The food was average and the portions enormous."}
{"text":"For the location: great service. Really good appetizers, solid food. No complaints but not blown away. I would recommend and I would come again"}
{"text":"Went here the other day with my husband. This place made me feel like royalty, however the food wasn't as good as I expected. The customer service was top-notch and I even left a 15$ tip. All in all it was a pretty good experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food but dark at the bar area. The place has good food and the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"WOW!!  I never thought I would find a place outside of the city of Chicago and I actually think I'm in Chicago while I'm having wine and dinner. This place is fabulous!!  The meat, the fish, the wine, the service, the live entertainment that they even bring in on Monday's; its all simply just the place to be.  They also have a location in South Charlotte if you can't make it to the Lake Norman area. Just tell em' Barrett sent you!!"}
{"text":"Had the lamb special with a Demi glaze that was incredible! The steaks here are also fantastic, sides are plentiful and the wine, of course good! Never had a bad experience with the service either , everyone is friendly and helpful,"}
{"text":"Filet and crabcake entrée rocks.  Get it with a side of Asian sauce that is served with the fried lobster tails.  very good"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short...hubby wanted to hit RC again for Queens Feast, I begged him to let me start my list of places, hence we visited M & M's.  We had an amazing waitperson, Anna, she helped us decide and made recommendations.....ribs and Wahoo....both were great... Ribs completely delicious! Fork tender! I'm gluten free and they totally made my dining excellent!  The crime brûlée was the absolute hands down best in the city.....we will return! If you've been away come check them out agIn and if you are new get there fast!!  Mickey stopped by our table,he was dynamic and passionate about his craft! Lovely wine, Sbragia, and our martini's were a delight.  Bartender likes their job, they made our cocktails with finesse and experience!  Going back very soon!! Thanks, Mickey! And, Anna!!"}
{"text":"Mehhh.  I'll be honest... I expects a bit more.  The food was mediocre.  I had a filet which was a little over cooked and I got it Oscar (with asparagus and crab meat and bernaise) and it was cold.  Is that how is done?  I'm seriously asking because that was my first time... If it is I'm not a fan.  Mickey and Mooch get brownie points for being kid friendly.  The kids loved their food and having a really nice server but the food was nothing special.  I left feeling like we could have had the same meal, at chilis next door for way less money.  Another plus is the turtle pond and fountain on the side.  The kids enjoyed that as well"}
{"text":"I'm going to start with why they got a 4 and not a 5. We went for dinner and the music. About 9:15 we asked when it's going to start. The piano player called out. Food was great. Seared tuna and lobster appetizers. Scallops crab cake and lobster for the main courses. The chocolate cake is to die for I'm a sucker for that. And the service was top shelf. Something you don't see as often but then bill reflected it."}
{"text":"The food is much better than the service. It's terrible. I went here only to find that the place was relatively empty which had  me a little weary because a  restaurant should never be empty on a Friday night. I was satisfied with my food. However, I wasn't satisfied with the service. This guy had NO knowledge of champagnes and took forever to bring our food and drinks. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday recently, and it was great. The food and service were both impeccable. If I had to critique, I would say that the portion sizes are quite large. Also, another gentleman was celebrating his birthday, and he received a free dessert while I did not. Great food. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Most disappointing meal I have ever had in Charlotte. For a restaurant at this price point it was in utter disrepair....our leather booth was held together with duct tape...yes...duct tape.....the fabric on the other seating area was full of holes and dirty looking. Shrimp Cocktail was not the freshest, lobster was dry and I only ate a small portion of it. Husbands soup was OK and his filet was edible. The dessert was a bright spot. Service was mediocre...more like a Chile's or Friday's not what you would expect for Ruth's Chris - Morton's prices....We will definitely not be returning!"}
{"text":"Had a not so great experience at Mickey and Mooch last night. The food was good. As were the drinks. The live music (i.e. Acoustic Solution, keep those guys coming back) was REALLY good.   Unfortunately, while the service was friendly, it was mediocre at best. The floor was messy and the bathroom was dirty.  Frankly, for a place that charges steakhouse prices given the appearance of duty surrounds, the are better places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"The hours of operation is deceiving. The bar is open late but the restaurant closes early. Fell short of expectations after the long drive to check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent  restaurant  , food made to near perfection. Friendly staff. Accommodating to handicap individuals.  The one in Huntersville NC.  Have not tried the other."}
{"text":"We have had better for less although the sea bass was excellent.  Ordered a piece of cake to share; received the DOUBLE piece (for $13) without asking for it.  The live music was very talented. Overpriced; taking full advantage of this (more affluent) area."}
{"text":"First time going here. My girl took me there for my surprise bday get together. This restaurant is awesome and I definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Had dinner there this past Saturday night. Wasn't as good as I remember it being. The salad was mainly ice berg lettuce, the talapia was good but doesn't come with anything if you choose the side salad. At dessert we were not offered coffee. Mashed potatoes are still amazingly good and same for the coconut shrimp!"}
{"text":"The food, the wine and the service.  Dana makes that experience time and time again.  My wife and I are huge fans of Dana and request her area every time we dine.  Don't forget to grab a slice of their multi layered chocolate cake...to die for!"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad meal at Mickey & Mooch. We like to try different restaurants, but always migrate back. The she crab soup is the absolute best. I could just eat a huge bowl of that with bread and make it a meal. :-) Mickey himself has stopped by our table and is a genuine perfectionist. No corners cut here. Fresh and delicious AND huge portions!"}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week to try it out. Not impressed with either the decor or the food. There are many similar priced restaurants that are far better in the nearby area. Service was excellent and fast, so that is why I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"Very dissapointing. Last visit 2 years ago was very good.  Everything slow with many mistakes. Too many choices to pull me back. Food was good."}
{"text":"We just tried Mickey & Mooch for the second time this weekend and I gotta tell you, I really like this place! Every once in a while I get a craving for a yummy filet and baked potato and this place hits the spot without costing a fortune! The steak with 2 sides is around $25 - and no, this is not outback-quality steak. They have the highest grade beef as an option, but I was happy enough with the \"regular\" version (sorry I don't have my beef grades memorized). Also - the wedge salad is delish!  The service has also been great both times. We had reservations & were seated right away  Our waitress was attentive...in fact, all the servers are attentive to all the tables. They seem to float to each other's tables (and have food runners), which makes it very efficient overall.   Wine options are really affordable...if my memory is correct the Pinot Noir I got was $5.50 for an 8 ounce pour - that's really big! So another bonus!  The bar looked really hopping - we were there on the early side, but there was a piano and live music later.   I do wish it was more scenic outside than the Arboretum, but the inside is still nice!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Food, terrible for the price. The food was all undercooked raw scallops (because they weren't brought out with the meal and i presumed rushed) under cooked my filet to the point the blood made me nauseous, the restrooms are filthy. Service was decent although we  waited for our utensils until after the appetizers were served. They did comp us the undercooked food, however not worth the money or the experience"}
{"text":"Was not impressed....made a 7:15 pm reservation and had to wait almost 45 minutes upon arrival to be seated.  Then once we were seated we had to ask a passing server if there was someone for our table since 15 min had passed with no one waiting on the table.  Poorly ran front of the restaurant which takes away from the food which wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"I have a list of restaurants in which I will never eat; McDonald's, Burger King and the like. This silk hat on a pig is one of them. The service is a joke. Whoever is in the kitchen is moonlighting as a chef from there day job scraping road kill. My experience was so horrifyingly bad I had the unfortunate and dubious pleasure of meeting the owner. He looked down his nose at me, frowning at my feedback, chomping at the bit while I was talking for his chance to tell me how successful his restaurant has been all these years. We didn't even complain! We had already handed over the money for this absurd excuse for a dinning experience and were walking out the door when he told us to have a nice night; skirting the customary inquiry about our experience. I couldn't resist not dishing to the man only to find the root of the establishment's insidious disfunction.   Nearby alternatives with similar service standards and food quality with a cheaper menu: Chilis, Taco Bell, Walmart (they have a candy isle)"}
{"text":"My family had a dinner celebration here for my grandmother's 85th birthday. We had the whole back room reserved for ourselves. It was definitely nice to be set apart from the rest of the restaurant so we could party in privacy. The servers, although very few for the several guests we had, were doing their best to take care of us. Polite and friendly, but obviously rushing about.   The dinner was buffet style with options of the chicken marsala, NY strip steak, shrimp and broccoli alfredo, plus side salad, green beans, mashed potatoes, and other veggie sides. Unfortunately, I was the last table to be called up, and by the time I got to the food, there was practically nothing left. They were out of chicken and steak. They already brought out all the steak, so there would be no more of that. Womp. Then they kept saying \"2 minutes\" for the chicken. A set of ten 2minutes ticked by before getting more chicken. I suppose the fault of not ordering enough steak lies on my family, but I don't think guests should have been waiting for refills to come out. That should have been planned better.  I ended up only grabbing some pasta, green beans, and mashed potatoes. All were pretty good, but I could have also been really hungry. They ran out of salads at the buffet table too (sheesh), and so I had to ask a server for one to fill me up more. He said they weren't bringing any more out, but he gave me one anyway. The dressing I picked was weird, though. I assumed it was a Thousand Island by the color, but it had chunks of blue cheese in it. Weird, especially because right next to it was another container for what I assumed was actual Blue Cheese dressing. Serving blue cheese and blue cheese? Huh.  Desserts came out and saved my meal. The chocolate cake was delicious!"}
{"text":"Very nice family restaurant in the area. It is a white cloth with great selection of dishes and has affordable and multiple options for kids.  The portions are huge and enough to bring home without compromising quality.  It is truly a hidden gem. An upscale scene without high prices. And family friendly too!"}
{"text":"Queens Feast at Mickey & Mooch was great! Haven't been in the restaurant for a few months and thought this would be the perfect opportunity to re-live my dinners there. This did not disappoint me. It was great. We had a party of four, all of us ordered off the Restaurant weeks menu. Two of the party had the Charleston Crab soup, it was delicate but full of crab and delicious, and a very large bowl. One of my party had the Wedge salad which I have had before and they are known for--it was fantastic! I ordered the Filet of Beef with Blue Cheese fondue---Melted in my mouth!! Could have ordered two plates of it!! For my Entree i  had the Cold Water Lobster tail, they were two smaller ones cut in half but wonderfully fresh and tasty. My husband had the Rack of Ribs, smokey and falling off the bone! My friends had the Lamb Chops which looked incredible and the other woman had The Crab Cakes, she loves to order them all over and said these were some of the best!  Desserts were very special, I had the Italian Almond Creme cake..like a Tiramisu with Amaretto instead of coffee and brandy ..It was like a cloud! My husband had the Creme Brulee which was very good.  We left feeling very satisfied to find out that it was still a great choice and a place to remember to come ...----more often!!"}
{"text":"I was in the area shopping just next door and was persuaded to come over for a quick glass of wine.  Having been to the other location in Lake Norman I knew the sort of place this is but I hadn't been in so long I'd forgotten.     With a very large bar area and comfortable high top table and chairs this place makes for a great after work spot probably.  The service shabby either, she was nice and polite and very accomodating to all in our party.    The food was par but definetly not bad.  I had the salmon atop a caesar salad and for the finish I had the chance to take on the 7 layer chocolate cake.  The cake was to die for and large enough to feed a small village!  Highly recommend it.  Parking is tough in this location but that's true of any of the businesses at the Arboretum."}
{"text":"I had eaten at this location many times before and it was always ok until most my recent trip during restaurant week July 2015. My crab soup had so much shell in it. Husband ordered ribs and he said they were tough. My filet was overlooked and under seasoned. I ordered med rare it was was almost med well. I sent it back and got another one cooked the same way! I just ate it because I didn't want to wait for a 3rd. As we were wrapping up dinner, we overheard a couple next to us complaining that their cake was still frozen.   We will never return here! Sad because it used to be one of our favorite places!!"}
{"text":"We have been going here as a family for years.. Disappointed by the service and food. Had to send meals back. Will not be back."}
{"text":"When I can't get to the Atlantic or pacific for seafood mickey & mooch is the next best thing!  However seafood isn't their only strength the steaks and pasta dishes are one of the best in charlotte.  You can't go wrong with anything on this menu!"}
{"text":"I discovered M&M on the Opentable app. I was briefly visiting the area and wanted a place with a lot of variety for dinner. We made reservations for 9:15pm and when we arrived, the hostess immediately took us to our table. The menu has many options, so it met the criteria for what I'd hope. There was live music also, which was a plus for me. I would definitely go back. I enjoyed my entree, but we ordered truffle fries as an appetizer and they were too greasy."}
{"text":"I have honestly never had a bad meal here. I believe they have some of, if not the best, prices in town. The restaurant itself is very clean, with dim lighting and lots of booths along with a great bar area. The food is always cooked perfectly. I love the New York steak or the filet and salmon combo. Did I mention how great their prices are? I also love their grits and the fact that they have a lot of great wines by the glass, which is great for me because hubby doesn't drink. They often have live music. Service is always great too, we especially like one server who we tend to get a lot. I believe her name is Sarah. She's very attentive and friendly. Next time you are choosing between some stuffy uptown or South Park steakhouse, I urge you to consider this place instead."}
{"text":"We had a celebration dinner here last night with a small group of friends. They messed up our reservation so we had to wait in the bar for about 10-15 mins.  The bar waitress was extremely friendly and very helpful.  Once seated we ended up ordering a variety of meals.  Petite Filet, Bone-In Ribeye, Blackened Scallops and Lump Crab.  Everyone was very pleased with their meals and everything was prepared great.  For side dishes we had mashed potatoes (just ok), fries (very good), grits (awesome), wedge salad (awesome), house salad (good), snap peas (good).  Staff was pleasant and helpful.   Can't wait for another excuse to go come here again."}
{"text":"I recently had a business dinner at Mickey & Mooch, dubbed \"The Best Steakhouse in the Area\" by US Air Magazine (a questionably reputable source). I figured it was a good opportunity to try the place without spending my own money.   First, the restaurant is in a strip mall. I took a second to let that thought pass and walked in to a warm and inviting atmosphere. Nothing overly unique, it felt like a typical, higher end steakhouse.   We ordered a few bottles of nice Cabernet for the table from their adequate but pricey wine list. The waiter brought out wine glasses for the table. Half were appropriate, nice red wine glasses. The other half were a utilitarian wine glass you would find when ordering wine at Applebee's. When asked about the different glasses, the waiter indicated they \"ran out\" of the nicer, red wine glasses. It was 7:00 on a Wednesday night with a HALF FULL restaurant and you are telling me you are out of red wine glasses? I found that a bit tacky and watching them pour the Frog Leap Cabernet into these glasses pained me a little.   Our table ordered the Coconut Shrimp and Shrimp cocktail for appetizers. The Shrimp in the cocktail were WAY overcooked and seemed like the precooked grocery store shrimp defrosted and put on a plate. Coconut shrimp were fine, but nothing special.   I had the wedge salad that I was not impressed by at all. For dinner I ordered the \"USDA Prime\" Fillet, cooked Pittsburgh Medium-rare. Any good steakhouse should have no issue getting this order right. It came out medium rare, but had bearnaise sauce all over it, which I did not order. The steak itself was ok, but certainly not up to \"USDA Prime\" standards.   The green beans I had with the steak were overcooked and still had some of the stalk on a few. I guess it may have been an indicator that they were not frozen because even Bird's Eye knows to take all the stalks off. The crab cake I had on the side was pretty good.   For dessert, we all shared a few slices of their 7 layer carrot cake. This had to be the largest slice of carrot cake I have ever seen. The cake was a little try, but not too bad. I heard the 7 layer chocolate cake is to die for, but didn't get to sample. Either will be huge and a challenge for 4 to finish.   Pros: Atmosphere, Good Service (minus the wine glass mishap), dessert   Cons: Uninspired, poorly cooked entrees and appetizers, overpriced for the quality, inadequate wine glasses."}
{"text":"So many great reviews yet we went for Mother's Day and my food was horrible.  We started out with MOB onion rings.  Quantity was awesome but the actual onion batter tasteless.  I got the Talipia with lump crab and was nothing special.  I did get the loaded bake potato and that was the best part of the meal.  I also ordered a side of crab cake that was plated on some kind of crema.  Yuk....  overall.. not impressed at all."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte!  The live music is entertaining and the older crowd seems to enjoy dancing and drinking on Friday and Saturday Nights.  I was introduced to Mickey & Mooch during restaurant week a few years back.  I am heavily addicted to the wedge salad, filet mignon fondue and the crab cakes."}
{"text":"Came here with my family about 7 of us, made reservations , got seated right away on a friday night. Servers were very attentitive to our table there was never and empty glass or empty plates at the table. I had the wedge salad was amazing maybe slight over dressed with dressing for some but i thought it was perfect. I got the charlotte crab soup that was very creamy served hot nice amount of crab too. This place was highly reccomended to us and very happy we saved it for when your family was in town."}
{"text":"Ate there last night for restaurant week. I had not been there since they first opened years ago. Food and service was ok, but it's time to clean the place! Worn vinyl tablecloths? In a fine dining restaurant? I don't think so. Need to dust, patch the chipped paint and pay attention to the dirty bathrooms. Won't spend my $ there again."}
{"text":"Oooh, Mickey you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my...diet! Salads, awesome. Caesar great. Wedge, great. Crab cake and filet mignon combo....an indecisive food lover's heaven. Crab cake has lotsa crab (such a lovely change from places that are all filler) and the medium rare filet is fork tender. Dessert is also delic. Great seafood specials. Lively atmosphere, feels more downtown than LKN. Great for dates, girl's night out and corporate dining. Solid service. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"The filet mignon was literally the worst steak I have ever eaten. This is not an exaggeration.  I sent it back and they brought another and I wanted to puke when I tasted it. The side dish of potatoes was inedible. I will not be going back. One gets the impression of very weak management."}
{"text":"BEWARE ROACH!!  I was here tonight for restaurant week.  After a  longish wait to be seated in an empty restaurant we were seated by a table next time the window with blinding sunlight...but they made no attempt to provide shade. The waiter was pleasant and attentive.  However midway through the meal a roach was crawling on the wall right above us.  My husband killed it with his napkin and we alerted the waiter.  He apologized and said the exterminator had just been in.  The manager didn't stop by and they did not offer to comp or give any discount on our meals.   Mickey and Mooch used to be a favorite of ours but this restaurant looked like it needed a renovation... that on top of our unwanted guests means I won't be back....and my reason for leaving the review is because of their poor response to our gross situation.  Management is not doing their job."}
{"text":"Dined at Micky and Mooch for the first time two weeks ago. Ordered the filet oscar style with bearnaise over asparagus. Delicious. The seven layer chocolate cake is to die for. Old school ambiance. Live music which makes it a little loud. Very good service. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks only...bar is always packed, but lively and folks are talkative.  Bartenders are good, though not great as I find I always feel like a slight delay between when I get my drink or requested drink order and when I actually get it *grin*."}
{"text":"Mickey & Mooch is the best! Love their WILD salmon! The only restaurant in the area that serves WILD salmon. Also, the servers are great. Our server Julie made our evening very special. Julie was professional, kind, and uplifting. A good server makes dining a pleasure. Julie deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Every visit is amazing. The staff the food just amazing. There is not much to go wrong with restaurant. I had the  Calamari as an appetizer. As an entree I had the lamb chops with a side of asparagus. Just amazing. Just a tip the greens are the best side, trust me. It was my mom's birthday so she got the brownie with ice cream and desert, free from the restaurant. It was so rich a chocolatey. As always great experience."}
{"text":"Went to M&M with my grandparents and parents this evening because they wanted to try it. I was a tad bit apprehensive about coming because of the mixed reviews but was pleasantly surprised.   Everyone was very pleased with their meal. I had the Seared Tuna encrusted with Pepper and Braised Cabage. Both were excellent.   Quality and speed of service was also excellent!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week...had an amazing meal! Our waitress Dana was so sweet and friendly - would totally request her again when we go back.   Drinks:  Smoochtini - pineapple vodka and pineapple juice - yum! Frosted Russian - whoo hoo!!  Food: Appetizers - Crab soup - great, husband really enjoyed!  Shrimp cocktail - great, lots of big shrimp Dinner - I had the sea bass with crab meat and some amazing sauce.  Husband had bone in pork chop - he said it was pretty good.  We both loved the sides - grits and mashed potatoes.  Too full for dessert - took home a HUGE piece of the chocolate cake and a toasted almond cream cake - looked heavenly!  Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Celebrated our father's birthday on Saturday, February 18 we were lucky enough to have Kristen for our server she was incredible! The food was absolutely fantastic the coleslaw blue cheese side and loaded potatoes are a must all the meats melted in your mouth. If you have not been here it's a must enjoy! TT"}
{"text":"Meh is the perfect word for this place.  Based on how empty the dining room was on Sunday, I think many have also come to the same conclusion.    Service: While our server was nice, the service was poor.  It started with waiting for 10 minutes until being asked if anyone had gotten to us yet.  From there, we ordered our appetizer and drinks (2 glasses of wine and a beer) at the same time.  The appetizer came out 5 minutes before our drinks.  When the drinks did arrive we placed our dinner order, which they got one of the 3 wrong.  Now while this happens and not that big of a deal, the server told me he did not even realize they had a Shrimp Carbonara on the menu and that's why I was given a Chicken Carbonara.  Food:  We ordered the special king crab Appetizer and it was almost void of flavor.  The texture also made us think it was not very fresh.  For the entrees, the Chicken Carbonara was ok.  The Shrimp Carbonara and Shrimp Scampi both had shrimp that was void of flavor.  So I am thinking they need to find a new seafood vendor.  We ordered a carrot cake to go.  It was good but my thinking is that's made somewhere else.  Atmosphere: This was ok.  The place was empty so it was quiet and with the delays in service we had plenty of time to chat.  The vinyl white tablecloths felt like a cost cutting measure and not what you expect from a $$$ place.    Overall, it's not a place I would suggest for the price or what you think the experience should or would be.  It's just meh."}
{"text":"Must say I was pretty disappointed on my visit here. I was pretty hopeful despite some of the negative reviews, because of personal friends who spoke highly of Mickey & mooch. The ambiance was especially nice too, but the service was average and the food was mediocre. I had the mahi mahi, which was the catch of the day, along with the charleston crab soup and also tasted the Alfredo pasta, collard greens, mashed potatoes and cabbage, none of which excited me. Our group went for Restaurant Week and the Queens Feast menu was pretty extensive; Unfortunately that didn't equate to extraordinary. I took my toasted almond cream cake to go. I wish there was a half star option because I would give this place 2 1/2 stars. I'll rate up to 3 just because the waiter gave our group complimentary dessert, even the ones who ordered off the regular menu. I think it's partly to make up for the lack of visibility we had of him. It took about 30 mins for him to bring our table bread, and we barely saw him while eating, so good thing no one needed anything! He disappeared for lengthy periods of time for no apparent reason. Maybe he was playing in the band? I forgot to add that as soon as our waiter came to tell us the specials, he informed us that they ran out of Caesar salad (is that possible? Wouldn't that be easy to make?) and baked potatoes.  Disappointing since I wanted a Caesar salad. Overall it's not that the food was nasty, just not memorable.."}
{"text":"Have yet to hear a good experience with their service. With so many options in Charlotte, take your money somewhere else that actually treats guests well!"}
{"text":"I read all of the reviews over the past few months.  Seriously!,  I eat out every day and at fine restaurants in Charlotte weekly. Again...this is one of the best if not THE best restaurant in the Charlotte metro area for the best overall food, service  for Americana and Italian restaurants in our area. Those who have bad reviews are either inexperienced in fine restaurant cuisine or came during a busy restaurant week with unrealistic expectations.  There is NO competition for consistency, quality, service and great value. If you want excellent service, ask for Anna or Cecilia!  You will seriously never be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mickey & Mooch has it down! The ambience of the restaurant is so welcoming and reminds me of a steak house in NYC. It ha a nice sized bar area as well as a good sized dining area. The bar had live music on a Saturday night which was a lot of fun-even had some people dancing! The employees were all very nice, especially our waiter. He was very knowledgeable of the menu, shared all the specials with us, and was very attentive. The food came out extremely quick and was on point! The coconut shrimp was so good, it had just enough breaking to give it a crunch without tasting just like breaking. And it was served with honey mustard-different from what I've seen-but really delicious! I also had the Caesar salad with shrimp and it was amazing!!! The shrimp were huge and the Caesar dressing was something to note. All the food that everyone else had looked amazing as well! I would definitely return again to try some different items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Would you go back? Yes.  What pushed this from 3 to 4 stars for me...definitely the huge chocolate cake.  I don't meet many desserts that require a to-go box, but this was one.  Now, with that said, you can definitely find similar \"mile high\" chocolate cakes at a number of steakhouse chains, but that doesn't take away from my appreciation for this brilliant concept. :)"}
{"text":"I had the 6oz filet with baked potato and my hub had the crab cake with filet and green beans. Both meals were cooked to perfection. We topped it off with 7 layer chocolate cake. It was clearly fresh and the best restaurant cake I've ever had. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. We will be going back."}
{"text":"We went for restaurant week and were pleased overall with the menu options, food quality and presentation.  My wife's filet and gorgonzola fondue appetizer was delicious, as were the crab cakes and orange dreamsicle cheesecake.  My pork was pretty rare in the center, which I know is safe, but its not my preference, so I would have appreciated being asked how I wanted it cooked, but it was just ok, nothing special.  The side of grits was the best part of my meal.  I think the restaurant is priced decently, maybe a little on the high side. The quality of service was also good.  The waitress was prompt and all other servers were attentive and courteous.  I'll definitely go back, but only if I was offered another deal like restaurant week or a Groupon, but not otherwise."}
{"text":"Caveat: this review is based on a free dinner that was a simplified menu.  I went to a financial planner presentation.  This is by far the best 'free' meal I have gotten for attending a sales pitch.  I had a salad with very tangy ginger sauce that met all expectations.  They gave me plenty of dressing so if you want to lower the calories ask for it on the side, this is about 50% more dressing than other places give you.  I ordered the salmon, half by accident (its complicated), and it was slightly overcooked for my tastes. I like my salmon under cooked because the texture and fat are better when you have some of that dark orange inside and not just light pink.  That being said it wasn't overly dry so I think normal people would have loved it.  I wished it had the crispy skin on it but it didn't (again something I love is the skin on one side of my salmon filet).  I skipped the potatoes and they kindly brought me a double if not triple helping of the green beans.  Green beans were flavorful and not too watery, unfortunately they used plenty of butter on them.  I really enjoyed the butter but people eating green vegetables for flavor and health won't be as enthused about the number of grams of fat from butter they are getting.  The meal concluded with carrot cake, I didn't eat it but instead brought it home for the folks back there.  It was a favorite, better than anywhere else.  They asked where I got it and I refused to tell them for fear of going broke buying cake from this place every week.  No exaggeration - the carrot cake was applauded and demanded as the new staple.  I didn't eat it as I am trying to unfat myself.  If anyone reads this and knows me - I am not calling the other people fat."}
{"text":"Mmm delectable seafood options. I got an excellent plate of large scallops with lobster tails on the side. I went extravagant because it was my birthday and I wasn't paying. The scallops were practically melt in your mouth with the delicious buttery sauce they came in. And the lobster was greatly complimented by what tasted to me like butter with a great cut of lemon juice mixed in. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were simple but great. And I topped it all off with an Oreo cheesecake that the waitress was nice enough to stick a candle in.  I wasn't superbly impressed though with the set up in the dining area. Seriously, they're trying for such a high class feel but it's thoroughly marred by the presence of booths lining the walls. And judging from the opinions of other reviewers, those booths are the source of other complaints too. They HAVE to GO! So ugly and out of place. The springs are weak and you sink in away from the table. It's a horrid situation. Don't worry Management, you'll fit just as many people with chairs on the opposite side of those tables.  Service isn't so bad - they all seemed tired. I loved the low lighting. There was a table of friendly diners next to us who we also talked with. So the experience wasn't so bad. But please remove the booths by the time I return. I'm begging you!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed dinner here; however, our visit on 12/16/16 was not good.  We made reservations for 7:00 p.m. and arrived 10 minutes early.  There were tables available; however, the hostess said they were not ready to seat us.  We had a beverage in the bar and she told us when we were ready we would be seated.  We gathered our coats and went to the hostess desk.  The hostess then asked if we would like to eat in the bar - no, we do not.  That's why we made the reservation.  She then made us wait while she located a table for us; and, again there were at least 7 open tables(?).  Our waitress, came and went.  She showed up once or twice to take the plates from the table, but she was not attentive at all.  The food was nothing special either.  We won't be going there for a very long time, if at all."}
{"text":"Mickey & Mooch is simply overrated.  If this were 20 miles further from Charlotte, it would be held at a different standard.  Fact is though, there is too steep of competition and too many options for Charlotte and the surrounding areas.    I continue to take my parents here sometimes just because I know they don't really want to always to into the city.  Fact is though, for the money, Sullivan's destroys it.  The crabcakes here don't hold enough flavor or moisture and are too heavy on butter and sauces.  The shrimp and grits is just overboard and not focused on the layers of flavors.    We have been on more than one occasion where there was a singer who was just too loud and quite honestly couldn't hold her key.  It was somewhat humorous for us but we started to wonder if she was nearly drunk.  As the stars reflect, \"Meh, I've experienced better.\"  The food isn't terrible but for the competition they stack themselves against, it's simply subpar.  There is a good market for the neighborhood people who don't want to leave the Birkdale area though.  Another plus is a good wine and liquor selection."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Good Menu and delicious food and ambience.  If you bring a child make sure they are manageable.  They do have burgers for children."}
{"text":"This was a family dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday. We were crammed at our table(4 adults, 1 pre-teen, 2 toddlers). Restaurant was not packed, however, service was extremely slow..(my mother-in-law waited 20-25 mins for a bar drink; we waited about 15 mins for salad dressing; we waited another 20 for chicken tenders after the server had dropped the original plate on the floor-this is after everyone else had already been served their dinner). Our server was nice enough, but always seemed to be \"in the weeds\", and therefore no extra attention or apologies were made after the slow service  or dropped food. Food was just ok....not good enough to overlook the other shortcomings.  We've eaten at the Lake Norman location a few times, and never had these issues. Could have been just an off night-- I do know prom was going on, but again restaurant was not overly crowded. Best part was the music in the bar."}
{"text":"This was the worse service of a restaurant I have ever had. The waiter waited 20 minutes to take our order for drinks. Then he took another 15-20 minutes to refill my wife's glass of water. The food once it came was NOT worth the price. The portion size was small and the taste of the food was of a 1 star restaurant. The temperature of the food was horrible and so was the waiter. We will NEVER eat here again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I started going to Mickey and Mooch when our bartender friend Johnny ended up going from Bravo to there.  Love the steaks, wine, and drinks.  The atmosphere is an older crowd, but we like that because people are respectful and always willing to chat. The only recommendation is that they pair down the wine list because its a lot to handle and they should give pairing recommendations."}
{"text":"I visited here last night for my birthday dinner during Restaurant Week (RW).  I have participated in Restaurant Week in the past, patronizing two seperate restaurants, which will remain nameless, and did not enjoy either experience.  However, my visit to Mickey and Mooch last night has wiped away all of the negative views develope during my past Restaurant Week experiences.  I arrived around 8:15pm and had a reservation for 8:30pm, and was told that it would be a short wait, as the place was somewhat crowded.  My friend sat outside on one of the benches in front of the restaurant while awaiting our call to be seated.  After waiting about 10 minutes I decided to go in and check the status of our wait and was told that we could be seated :-).  As we were escorted to our table, we enjoyed the pleasant sounds of live music and a pleasant voice singing familiar tunes.  Once seated, we were greeted by a pleasant waitress who provided menus and took our drink orders.  After returning with our drinks, we were ready to place our order, after asking a couple of question about the RW menu, which she answered.    I was somewhat disappointed that they did not have but one  of the Fresh Catch choices out of 4/5 choices listed on the menu, however, the choice that was available (Grouper) was one of my favorites.  I ordered the Crab soup, which was full of crab meat and came in a nice size bowl, similar to what you would receive during a normal visit. My friend ordered the steak, salad, and green beans. The appetizers were amazing, the entrees were even better, and the dessert was near orgasmic (key lime pie and toasted almond amaretto cream cake)!  I will definitely be returning here several more times, granted my bank account is setup to allow so."}
{"text":"I have been here two hours and I had reservations. Still sitting at bar if I don't get settled here I am leaving and eating Taco Bell. 120.00 at bar already crab cakes they were garbage finally being seated! Ok was seated crab soup was ok waiting on dinner to review!! Matt my server is great so far but food we shall see was good but when it takes 4 hours for dinner that's an Awful event. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Big disappointment for Queens Feast.  Started off by being seated at a dirty table.  Then my Wedge Salad was all core and garbage lettuce.  Husband's lamb chops were raw, ordered medium.   And the topper,  worst server ever.  So embarrassed we brought friends with us for a horrible meal.  Will never return."}
{"text":"Visited this location last Friday.  I am must say great great great.  Wed,Fri, Sat, (maybe Sun) they have music.  The band was great and I did a little twirling on the dance floor(area in front of bar).  The portions were great(not sure if it was because of restaurant week and they wanted to get everyone hooked).  But my mussels were sooo good and very meaty-which was a pleasant surprise.  The salads were huge. I also had the fillet and crab cake.  But with the huge appetizer and salad- I had to take most of it home. I also tried the seven layer chocolate cake, while good it was not all they hyped it up to be in my opinion.  Ive had better choco cake, infact threw it away later because i thought the icing tasted cheap.  The martinis were good and had sufficient alcohol and a decent price.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Came here for Charlotte restaurant week and I must say I am thoroughly disappointed. After eating the steak that's supposedly top quality angus, I went home that night to my surprise with a severely upset stomach (I would be a bit more graphic but I think you get the idea). Nonetheless, I emailed the \"corporate\" email provided on their website and never got a reply. Two stars is more than generous, only because the service was decent. If your going to claim your food is top quality, make sure that it is inspected properly before it is served to your guests......"}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary and had a delicious crab cake dinner and very good service. My only complaint/suggestion is to have cloth tablecloths. Using oilcloth (and ours had some stains) in a restaurant of this caliber seems cheap."}
{"text":"Despite making a reservation for Monday night, our party of nine had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and 45 minutes to get their first round of drinks. It took the waiter 35 minutes to inform us one drink we ordered was not available! It then took us 30 minutes to get checks.  When one of us asked to speak with a manager, a chef was sent out and said he would check on our checks. He offered no apology.  All left angry and disgusted. Granted it was Charlotte Restaurant Week and our party requested eight separate checks, but Mickey & Mooch blew this opportunity to impress nine women who live within five minutes of the restaurant. They need to staff up for these promotional events. Perhaps we caught a rooky waiter, but Eric K's review below indicates a very similar experience, including the sloshed drinks. A reminder to restaurants using Groupon or celebrating Charlotte Restaurant Week - Get you game on man! Otherwise, you are actually using your marketing dollars to hurt your reputation..."}
{"text":"I went for Charlotte Rest Week and this place was... OK. I went with some friends and I got the Charleston Crab Soup, which I love, but not from here. There were so many pieces of crab shells in the soup, I didn't even eat a fourth of it. That was very depressing for me. I also ordered the ribs with side of pasta alfredo. The pasta was a amazing, and the portion was plentiful. The sauce was the perfect consistency, I loved it. The ribs were OK... I don't know exactly what I was expecting but there wasn't much meat on the bones and were kinda tough. Unfortunate. I don't think that I will be returning to this restaurant, really was not that great.   Awesome staff and live music though!"}
{"text":"First and last time I will be going to this restaurant. I was served chicken that wasn't fully cooked. I had rated the thinner side of the chicken first so I thought it was cooked but got to the middle and there was a thick pink line through the center.   The waitress apologized, took the entree off the bill but still charged us for my salad. No manager came by or anything.  Worst experience at a restaurant I've ever had.  Here's to hoping I don't get sick."}
{"text":"I know it is rated the Best steakhouse in the area but, not by me! Of course, I didn't have steak, a table mate had ribs that he thought were good.   I had shrimp and grits-which were okay and they seemed similar to those I had at Currents in Promenade center. I found out that the chef at Mickey & Mooch left to open Currents-ah hah!  Anyway-business casual but, the placed was packed with people straight from work or in jeans. Have valet parking and you might need it-considering it is a strip mall location with several other restaurants.  Prices: about $13.00 or up for a plate. (mostly up!)  Reccomend: The Wedge salad or even the house with the blue cheese dressing-best I've ever had, but looks like Thousand Island dressing!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my time here. The waitress was wonderful and the was rewarding. The creamy crab soup was so good and tasty?"}
{"text":"Horrible service,     manager was rude and could care less.  I brought it to his attention that the yelp community says that is typical for his restaurant.  He went on to tell me \" screw yelp.  No one reads yelp reviews.\"  So i guess if you are reading this by chance.    Then you already know the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Mickey & Mooch used to offer a nice alternative to the restaurants in Birkdale for a fine dining experience. However, lately, both the quality of the food and the service declined so we no longer have M&M on our top choice list.   Their menu is expansive, but the cost is high for what you get.  Most entrees come with a house salad (which you can upgrade for an additional charge) and a side. Their crab soup is admittedly one of the best things I've had there.   One tip, however - GET A RESERVATION. Otherwise, you will wait for a long time for a table."}
{"text":"We wanted to celebrate our anniversary at some place unique and definitely not a chain.  I'm so glad I chose Mickey & Mooch!!!  Absolutely the best meal I have had in North Carolina since moving here three years ago.  Quite possibly one of the best meals I have had in my life.  We ordered a shrimp cocktail for our appetizer.  The cocktail sauce was perfectly balanced.  Just the right amount of horse radish.  Their wedge salad was fabulous.  The dressing was the best I've ever tasted on a wedge salad.  I ordered the salmon and crab cake for my entree.  The apricot glaze was phenomenal.  The crab cake was fabulous.  Just the right amount of breading.  The sauce was very savory.  My husband ordered the filet mignon prime cut and Alfredo pasta.  He requested rare and it was just right.  It was seared perfectly.  He said it was one of the best steaks he has ever had."}
{"text":"The restaurant was far from full when we arrived at 6:30. There were 6 in our party. It took quite a while for 4 of our party to get their drinks. One person ordered a nice bottle of red, old vine Zinfandel. It took a half hour for the wine to come (\"Mickey had to get it from the wine cellar\"). When it finally came it was ice cold. Good way to ruin a good bottle of red wine. The food was fine with the exception of an entree salad that was supposed to be mixed greens and turned out to be mostly iceberg lettuce. Even so, we won't go back. For the prices they charge, we expect much better service than what we got."}
{"text":"I had the salmon and lump crab cake combo with the green beans! Salmon and crab cake were excellent! The sauces that came with them were excellent! Everyone at my table enjoyed everything they ordered. Very good, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am tempted to give this place 5 stars... but the prices for what it is, keeps me at  solid 4 at most.  Went last night for dinner, for a girlfriends birthday celebration.  I was impressed at the crowd, as this was only a Tuesday night!!  Our server(s) were absolutely wonderful, and very helpful!  The wine selection by the glass is FABULOUS and the prices are indeed VERY good ( with a very heavy poor I might add)!!  The blue lump crab appetizer is delicious! 20 dollars to me seems a bit high for an app, but hey- this place DOES claim itself to be a high end steakhouse!  My Salmon entree was amazing, but the asparagus that came along with it was very hard to cut with my knife, and quite rubbery.  I would recommend this place for some good food, just expect to pay a bit on the higher side."}
{"text":"Ate here for restaurant week and lived it! The food was great, service was great, and they had live music that night. People were dancing and having a great time. I definitely recommend this place to anyone look for a great meal and a great time. I had the lamb cops with mashed potatoes and finished it off with carrot cake. It was epic!"}
{"text":"One of the best menus I have sampled in Charlotte, and highly recommended. Very pleasant staff, live entertainment and delicious food!"}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant and we were very pleased. Old classic feel with great music and service. The lump crabmeat app was delicious! The drinks were great and we had some great steaks. The loaded baked potato was awesome."}
{"text":"Went for Queens Feast on a Tuesday night. Not overly busy. Service was good Food tasted good Portions were way too large - easily shareable  Steak was not very flavorful  Lobster was great Sea bass was not very warm Scallops were great"}
{"text":"We frequent M&M from time to time, usually enjoy it.  Recent visit disappointing due to 1) 4 attempts at ordering wine resulted in either price was higher than printed on menu or wine was no longer available.  At least they don't print vintages (year) so one less thing to be wrong on menu.  2) 2 of 2 steaks under cooked.  Feedback was they tend to under cook as they can always cook longer.  Why not grill as ordered?  Service was solid but awkward given kitchen performance and bait/switch wine menu."}
{"text":"I visited Mickey & Mooch at Lake Norman (Huntersville) for the first time on New Year's Eve and  experienced what was easily the most mortifying and embarrassing moment of the year at the hands of a rude hostess.  After giving my name for the reservation an older hostess came from behind the hostess stand to seat me. As she and I walked to the dining area (directly to the right as you come into the restaurant), my friend who was taking me out to eat for a belated birthday dinner was coming in the door and I informed the hostess. Instead of pausing for a second, she kept walking and was on her way back when we entered the dining area. \"You ladies enjoy your dinner,\" she said and walked back to the stand. There were several empty tables and but for the menus on the table, we wouldn't have known which one was ours. We ultimately sat ourselves. Rude.  Dinner was served and our food was fine. My grouper was a bit undercooked, but  2/3 of it was edible, so I didn't complain. Service was excellent and our waitress was very kind and attentive. I don't recall her name, but she was a younger lady with darker hair. When she checked my ID, she stated that she was 31 as well. I suppose at 31, I look as though I could be a 20 year old masquerading around as an adult of drinking age who chose Mickey and Mooch for a NYE dinner. Not very likely and we were the only guest whose IDs were checked that I saw, but very well. I can't fault someone for obeying the law.  After dinner, we ordered another round of wine and continued to chat. The waitress brought over the check to my friend and told her that there was no rush. About 5 minutes after finishing our glass of wine, the same old hostess who \"sat\" us comes and stands over the table. \"Did you ladies enjoy your dinner?\" she asked. We agreed that we did. \"Well, I desperately need this table, so I'm going to ask you to leave.\" She didn't wait for a response, she just walked off. She wasn't apologetic. She was abrasive, loud, and classless. As she lacked discretion and other guest listened and looked embarrassed for us, I was appalled at such a rude and tactless announcement. A better establishment would have quietly asked us to move to the bar (and spend more money - Hello) to continue our conversation as opposed to kicking us out of the restaurant. There were several empty tables in the back dining room. Therefore, I'm not sure why the situation was so \"desperate\".  Never have I experience such disrespect and lack of couth in a restaurant that fancies itself amongst the best in the area. It is not. The food is okay (3/5), but one bad apple can spoil the bunch. And that hostess was it."}
{"text":"First and last time here. We went to celebrate a birthday. The waiter, Randall, approached us with a terrible attitude. I thought for sure he would get nice, but that never happened.  He was rude and short the entire time. At the end, when waiters usually get nicer, he didn't ask if we needed to go boxes when we had lots of food left. For me he ruined the restaurant  experience.   I had shrimp and grits, which looked delicious, but disappointed big time because they were bland. If I ever use salt, there is a problem and I used it twice. The food was bland.   Although, I loved ambiance I would not go back. He must hate his job! Called to let the manager know about the service, immediately after eating, and he was just as rude. I couldn't believe how he handled a complaint. Poor, poor service and a big disappointment!"}
{"text":"After looking at the reviews of this place I was waiting to be disappointed, but that was far from the case! When you walk in, the layout and decor makes you feel like you just stepped into a NYC steakhouse. They even had a little Italian guy singing in the bar room! The waitstaff was very professional and organized and the food was amazing! The price point wasn't cheap but I didn't feel that it was over priced at all. Overall, It's a great place for dinner and drinks in the huntersville area."}
{"text":"I don't know why it's only rated 3.5 stars because this place is wonderful! We came her for dinner and loved the dark lighting and comfy booths. Service was wonderful and attentive.  I ordered the Filet which was perfectly cooked and my husband had a seafood trio with Chilean sea bass, shrimp and perfectly seared scallops. We ordered the grits as a side, which I HIGHLY recommend.  We finished with the seven layer chocolate cake. A \"small\" portion was plenty enough to feed our group of four... I can't imagine how big the large must be.   Overall, this is a wonderful place for a nice dinner. We'll be back again"}
{"text":"Decent service, reasonably priced food, ok/average food quality (did enjoy the mashed potatoes and collard greens, but salmon and filet were average). The ambiance is really nice, but the restaurant is not worth going out of your way for..."}
{"text":"The food keeps me coming back.  The wedge salad is the best.  Their dressing on the salad is too heavenly.  I dont know any restaurants that has a better wedge.  If you do.... Please friend me and give me the restaurant. Also, their mini crab cakes are so good.  It's bite size minis.  Their ribs and grits are good too. Also, most nights there is always music and you will see couples dancing.   When I have out-of-town visitors... This is my go to place.  The only down side, which is big.... Is that this place seems to be always under staffed.  That's how you know that the food is really good.  Because I have a low tolerance for slow service  I know that this restaurant is a steak place.... But I dont consider their steaks as being cream of the crop, and neither does my fellow yelpers.   So. If you are looking for a great steak dinner.... Then, I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Our new fav steak house in Charlotte area.  Caesar salad was great. I order the special fish with jumbo lump crab. Daughter had a fantastic filet mignon. Fries were excellent as well.  Service was excellent as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After 10+ years living within 5 minutes of Mickey & Mooch, we finally decided to try it out on Queens Feast night on Friday 1/20 with an 8:30 PM reservation. We arrived 15 minutes early and our table wasn't ready (certainly understandable). We were told that they give patrons 2 hours to complete their meal, so our table must have been reserved by someone for 6:30 PM. Ok that makes sense.  We finally sat down at 8:45 PM by the host who seemed totally overwhelemed with unhappy customers. He seemed to do his best managing them and was cordial (appeared to be a young man doing his best). After we were sat, we started looking at the menus. There was absolutely 0 discount between regular prices and queen's feast prices that we could tell. In some cases, the queen's feast prices appeared higher than regular prices.   Looking around at the wait staff, they all appeared to be frantic. By 9:00 PM, we hadn't even seen our waiter to ask about drinks or give us water.   At that point, we were so frustrated and disappointed that we got up and left.   I went across the way to New South. I told the hostess of the issues we had at Mickey & Mooch and she took care of us. I had a delicious brook trout while my wife had crab cakes. The starter of fried green tomatoes and the bread pudding dessert was perfect.  Mickey & Mooch will never see a penny from me. They are obviously extremely poorly managed."}
{"text":"I'd actually like to make this 4 1/2 stars.  We went here with another couple on July 17, the first night of summer 2015 restaurant week.  This year, restaurants were allowed to offer both $30 per person and $35 per person meals.  Mickey & Mooch was $35 per person.  We had an excellent and attentive server that evening, who, when we commented on his skill told us he'd been through butler school and had been working at this restaurant for many number of years.  He made the meal better just by being top notch at what he does.  Two thumbs up on service.  As for ambiance, it wasn't loud, the acoustics lent themselves to being able to hold a conversation with the other people at the table which also made for an enjoyable dinner.  Appetizers:  Three of us ordered The Wedge (regularly $5.95) - iceberg wedge topped with bleu cheese, tomatoes, bacon, and balsamic drizzle.  It was delicious, as wedge salads tend to be and the balsamic drizzle was an unexpected and delicious addition.  The Charleston Crab Soup (regularly $6.50)- cream base with crabmeat, sautéed vegetables, and imported sherry didn't last long enough in the bowl for the rest of us to get a taste because the diner declared it excellent and inhaled it.    Main Dishes:  I ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes with \"famous green Tabasco butter\" (regularly $23.95).  I'm a bit, no a lot, of a crab cake snob.  I want them generous and meaty with lots and lots of lumb crab cake and only enough filler to barely keep them together.  These were FANTASTIC.  They were so large that I could only eat one and had one to take home to eat the next day which is a win/win in my book, two meals in one!  They were so good that I have been a little obsessive with crab cakes the past few weeks as you will notice in my other reviews, I've been testing out LKN's crab cake offerings and so far these are my favorite... top notch.They came with whipped potatoes that were a little lighter and fluffier than I'd like but I've never met mashed potatoes I don't like so my meal was the bomb.  My husband ordered the special seafood fresh catch of the day which was grouper and unfortunately he was disappointed.  I have a theory that oftentimes at steakhouses you ought to get steak and not fish and this kind of played in to that idea. I didn't get the description of his dish because I was so enthralled with my own plate.  The other couple both got the filet (regularly $22.95) topped with shrimp scampi and both were very pleased with their choices.  I thought they looked overcooked based on how I heard them order them done but they didn't complain.  Desserts:  Sometimes on Restaurant Week restaurants give limited dessert choices that are hard to transport home (I'm usually stuffed by the dessert course and would rather eat it later).  Mickey & Mooch was generous, there were five choices (White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, Almond Cream Cake, Creme Brulee, Carrot Cake, Our Famous 7-Layer Chocolate Cake ($2.95 supplement)) and all were transportable!  I got the creme brulee (regularly $6.25) and it was a surprisingly large portion for one.  My husband loved the carrot cake (regularly $6.95) and one of us splurged to get the 7-layer chocolate cake (regularly $7.95) which was huge and delicious.  So, at the end of the day... is the Restaurant Week pricing a significant savings, especially with this new for 2015 $5 jump in price?  Not necessarily.  My individual items ended up being $36.15 at regular price.  But... why do restaurants participate in Restaurant Week?  To bring in new business!  To give you a test drive to see how good they are and hope you will come back during the rest of the year.!!!  I left Mickey & Mooch announcing to our group that in January's Restaurant Week they have shot to my new \"definitely going there\" slot.  I had a great meal, I could converse with others at my table, we had a top-notch server, the wine (I forgot to mention) was a very generous pour... So Restaurant Week did what it set out to do.  I WILL go back the next time I can convince my husband I have an overwhelming hankering for crabcakes .  I have gushed on Facebook over my delicious meal which means other people have heard of my good experience.  Restaurant Week was a win for me and a win for M&M."}
{"text":"Here on 11/2/12  Meh! Mashed potatoes seem like baked potatoes that are mashed. Crab cakes had tons meat, but were soft and fell apart too easy, don't understand the rave reviews.  Old and stuffy atmosphere that needs an update.  Quantity of food given is large, but lacks quality."}
{"text":"My husband loves the wedge, she crab soup, and coconut shrimp.  I love the salmon and the seared tuna.  Usually good service too. And nice full glasses of wine!"}
{"text":"New to the area my boyfriend and I tried out Mickey and Mooch for the first time last Friday night. We had made reservations for 7:30 but came home hungry and tried to get in a little earlier at 6:30 - luckily this was no problem! I will say it definitely was much busier when we left so earlier is better on a Friday. The bar was packed and after seeing the size of their wine pours I understand why! We started our meal with two glasses of merlot that were very reasonably priced. The restaurant boasts they have a \"full 8 oz pour\" which they did not disappoint! As an appetizer we started with the fried calamari which was one of the specials that evening. I wasn't a huge fan of their breading it seemed more appropriate on an onion ring then delicate shellfish, but the dish was fresh and we were hungry ... so we obviously cleaned our plates.  For my entree I had the lobster and shrimp primavera and he had the veal porterhouse. It was recommended to get the saltimbocca topping: sliced prosciutto ham, mozzarella and sage infused demi sauce so we went for it!I honestly wasn't very whelmed with either of these dishes but they were decent! The primavera had a nice light sauce but could use additional seasoning and the veal porterhouse was overpowered by the saltimbocca. By far the best part of our meal was the wedge salad - topped with blue cheese, tomatos and a pair of delicious dressings. All in all I will return but may stick to a big glass of wine (or two) and a salad."}
{"text":"Frequently go here and it is very consistent. The food quality and quantity is very good. Fun entertainment on the weekends. Sometimes at peak periods the service can be a little slow but they are very friendly and try to make things right if there is a problem. The good news is there seldom is. You get what you order and it tastes just like you expect it to. Can't ask for a whole lot more. Give this gem a try. Recommend the Chicken Parm and a Wedge Salad. Guarantee you will take half of it home."}
{"text":"Although we waited 45 minutes after we had been seated before anyone even came to our table to serve us, the owner comp'd our entire meal."}
{"text":"Overall very disappointing. When we arrived there was no hostess and it seemed like the wait staff was covering that responsibility. Very disorganized. Our waitress was very nice but she was overwhelmed as they were clearly understaffed...and it was only half full. The food not very good. I had the shrimp scampi and it was bland and he pasta was over cooked.  My wife had a salad and it was essentially lettuce on a plate.  I expected more from a restaurant like this. My two stars are for the waitress who was very nice and was doing everything she could to keep up."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Mickey and Mooch this past weekend (Aug 3), having heard great reviews about it from our apartment manager. I really wasn't sure what to expect until we got there.  Note: the Providence/Arboretum location can be a bit tough to find; we drove around the parking lot for almost 10 minutes until we spotted it. It's in the southeastern portion of the Arboretum, on the west side.  The decor is jazz era-Jersey/New York and with the popularity of the Great Gatsby this year, this should be even more in appeal. The restaurant abuts a small lake, with al fresco dining, which is very picturesque. Even if you don't dine outdoors, I recommend walking out on the little overlook behind the restaurant to see the Canadian geese and other wildlife out there.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Mickey and Mooch has a variety of mixed drinks and wine (I had a hurricane punch, my wife a glass of Louis Martin), which was very good. For dinner, we shared a small lobster cocktail which was also well done (flavorful and not rubbery). My wife had the fried cod with a baked potato and I had the baby back ribs, also with a baked potato. The food is very plentiful and unfortunately we did not have room for dessert.  Mickey and Mooch's is rather pricey; a lot more than for the quality of food you get. The food was good, but the baby back ribs were pretty much like what I would expect from a Tony Roma's or Outback Steakhouse, which would have been a lot less. I respect that you're paying for ambiance and the experience, but at the prices M&M charge, I would have expected a little more zest.  All in all, it was a very pleasurable experience and we do intend to go back and try dessert as well."}
{"text":"Our go to spot on Friday night. The bar staff are outstanding, food delish- but be warned- the \"sides\" will feed 2-4. They are made for sharing. The music is perfect for dining! Steak-seafood-pasta- oh and the desserts! Oh boy!"}
{"text":"I ate at Mickey and Mooch for my college grad dinner 7 years ago and have been in love ever since, for anniversaries,  date nights, business dinners, whatever the reason I can get there!  Hailing from the Baltimore area - I have the authority to say their lump crab appetizer or dinner is the best crab plate you can get.  You get a plate that is piled high with a hefty chunk of crab for a dang good price - order the same thing at Ruth Chris and you get 1/5th of crab for 4 dollars more.  Crab cakes are still done better in Maryland though!  Wine by the glass is a deal!  Order a chardonnay at Sulivans - 14 dollars, half glass.  Same glass of wine here - 8 dollars and filled to the brim.    Cesar salads here are done perfect - I pushed my wedge out of the way to pick at my wife's Cesar last night.  To enjoy this place you will need to order a Prime Filet, medium rare.  For a fraction of the price you get a steak as good as Ruth Chris, just not covered in butter (not a bad thing).  They cook medium rare pretty well, and the prime is tender and butter textured  You want the best desert - 7 layer chocolate cake.  The full slice is enough to make you gain 3-lbs.  My wife and I weighed a full slice - it's almost 3-lbs!  They do offer it in the half slice - which weights just under 2!    Service is normally good, but that is definitely the difference between a Del Frisco's or Morton's, the waiters at Mickey and Mooch are not the caliber that you get at the higher priced steak houses, but I come for the food!"}
{"text":"We decided to try the Huntersville location for our anniversary. We had heard good things about it and typically go to Sullivan's.   I first ordered a Smooch, which was a pineapple martini. It was yummy.   My husband ordered the lump crab meat. He made a comment that it was \"actually real crab meat and very good\". Off to a good start.   We both had an iceberg wedge salad. (Great dressing!)  He ordered the lobster and was very pleased. He said he would order it again.   I ordered the petite filet medium rare. It was done to my liking. I ordered the loaded mashed potatoes as my side (check out the size!)  We ordered home made carrot cake to bring home, which we have not gotten to yet because we are still full! (Again check out the size of the cake!)  Overall we had a great time. The food was very good. The only negative was the noise level. Our reservations were for 7:30. We could barely hear each other or the waitress. I have noticed several posts say the later the noisier."}
{"text":"To begin with their award wining chocolate cake I would say it doesn't not deserve that cause I been a pastry chef all my life, and a layer chocolate sponge cake with over sweetened ganache no way deserves an award. We planned on getting a takeout cause we had a welcome coupon from that Resturant which said nothing that says takeouts not allowed after placing our Oder we waited seated outside this was the best part where the waiter offered us water and made us feel great, we where ready to pay they said we cannot use this coupon and have to speak to the manager chef walks out and says you are not allowed to use this on takeout it's only for dine in we said it doesn't not say on the coupon he arrogantly  said people like us do this kind of take outs and never return back I did not want to argue with this manager/chef/owner so we decided to dine in after waiting for few minutes our server brings our take out saying there was a misunderstanding I stayed calm and decide not to tip my server even after he being so good by offering us water. Food was awesome."}
{"text":"Very nice seared tuna and crab, all the fish was delicious but the salad was browned and there bread very bland and stale. Service was good but we were there early. Large well made drinks and tasty dressings, but way overpriced. Fun for the nostalgia though."}
{"text":"I went for restaurant week, a good opportunity to try new restaurants, and was not disappointed. I had the Charleston grits, salad, pesto encrusted salmon, and creme brûlée. I was not a fan of the creme brûlée, I thought the caramel tasted burnt. I've never had it before so it could've just been me and not that it really wasn't good. Otherwise everything was great and service was great."}
{"text":"Expected better, disappointed. Visited on a Sunday with my wife and our friends, with clearly a slow time for the restaurant - it was not crowded. We ordered a 9 oz petite filet medium rare, the rack of lamb medium rare, and the Chilean sea bass. Cabbage, loaded mashed potatoes, and green beans as sides. The sea bass tasted good, but was swimming in sauce - it was not delicate. You could barely see the fish under all the sauce. The filet came out between medium and medium well and had a disappointing sear, though it still tasted good. The lamb, however, was cooked unevenly, borderline rare in some parts and well done in others. It came with 4 bones, 2 of which were broken off on the ends - it was not pretty. If it wasn't for the friendly wait staff and the redeeming sides, this review would have been even lower. Not sure I'll go back, which is a shame since Mickey and Mooch is one of the few higher quality steakhouses in the area."}
{"text":"Friday night have dinning with friends. Such a wonderful relax place. Good food. Great dessert and wine. And live music make everyone so happy"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that seems clubby and old school by its name and decor, but it really lacks the intimate qualities and cozy feel of a lot of other upscale restaurants in the area.  The decor is a little heavy and shopworn. Clientele is mostly 55+ and I get the impression that the menu hasn't changed in the last 20 years.  Food is OK - we had steaks, tuna and salmon and from the looks of the sauce, I suspect that the entrees all got started at the same time and then the fish sat while the steak finished cooking.  Overpriced for what you get and the service, while OK, is not outstanding."}
{"text":"We moved to LKN in 2002 and back in the day, M&M was one of the few, non-chain, kinda-upscale dining choices around.  Fast forward 8 years and more options combined with general M&M inconsistency had us going elsewhere and I don't recall visiting since 2010.  Move ahead to 2017 and I wound up here for a work dinner with about 15 colleagues.  Had a GREAT experience!  The service was friendly and on top of things, the food from drinks to apps to entrees came out in a timely way and most importantly, everyone agreed that it was all delicious.  Some highlights...  Crab cakes - Loaded with crab, nicely seared served on top of a sauce that complimented things well.  Steak - Everyone who ordered one said it tasted great and was cooked perfectly no matter the temp asked for.    Salmon - Again, good reviews from all who ordered.  Moist and flavorful with both the champagne sauce and apricot glaze options getting high marks.  Sides - All were good with the blue cheese slaw and collard greens getting the most raves.  Nice job MIckey and you too Mooch!  Look forward to having you back on the local rotation."}
{"text":"Food was good, it did however take some time getting to the table. The kids menu is excellent in both price and options. Service could have been better, the waiter seemed lost at certain times, he seemed stressed as well. Biggest complaint though is seating. We had a reservation and were seated immediately in an almost empty restaurant. We were seated in the middle where it appeared they were trying to add more seating to the place as it was cramped. I asked if we could be seated along the outside of the restaurant and were told \"no, those tables are reserved.\"  They may have been but I can tell you that when we left two hours later, there was still no one at those tables and most were seated in the middle where you basically have to ask the table behind you if you need to back up your chair.  The host seemed arrogant and while Mickey and Mooch is nice, it's not nice enough for the uppity attitude. Too many nice places in Charlotte, may not be back to this one for a while. Two years ago, it was my favorite place to eat if that says anything."}
