{"text":"Had you ever dared to be different and paid for it. Yup that what happened to me today. 

This was probably the worst coconut milk shake I'd ever had!  After a few sips I pray for a tooth brush and a bottle of Scope.  

The cheap vanilla ice cream they used gave this unusual salty flavor, combined with  coconut bits floating into the fray. Just nasty. Ewww

I glad I didn't pay $1 dollar extra  to upsize it to large.  

Anyways I'll willing to try this place again but will stick to the OG black milk tea with tapioca pearls to baseline to perhaps see and taste what you guys are raving about.

They offer spicy fish balls on a stick if you're into that."}
{"text":"The best of Food Jungle franchise!

It's tucked in the corner where JCY House (clothing store).  It's hard to find, if you're new to Pacific Mall.  You can't miss it during weekends.  There's usually a line out the entrance.  It's quite popular amongst Asian.  There's more staff at this location than others.  You'll see 3-4 girls crammed into a tiny unit.  No personal space!  Same goes with ordering on the other side.

People are usually ordering their TOP TEN FAVES or COMBINATION with side order of Fish/Beef balls...delicious!  If you're new, can't go wrong with their list.  I've tried 90% and haven't found a miss.  I love Taro Milkshake (acquire a sweet taste and plant flavour), Green Tea Milkshake, Mango Mix (Peach/Papaya/Avocado) and Peach & Lychee.  Their not made out of powder but with real fruits. They make fruit beverages from frozen fruits cut into chunks and  blended with ice.  Milkshakes are made from ice cream and ice blended together.  Fish/beef balls are stewed to perfection in their crock pots.  I usually order spicy with additional hot sauce on top.

Average cost of beverage is $3.95 to $4.95 depending on size and tapioca is included.  They deal with CASH ONLY!  Occasionally, there's a VIP card given with 10% discount.  No stamp card (they do that well).

They're the cheapest bubble tea shop at Pacific Mall with QUALITY drinks!"}
{"text":"The best of bubble tea shops based on quality and authenticity (REAL fruit, none of these neon-coloured powder infused drinks that can make you glow).  

Decor or ambiance...absolutely zero.  Just patiently wait in line, get your take-out and enjoy it on the go.

The menu choice is extensive, and the menu is literally (plastered) all over the place.  Try a few and you will find your favourite.  

They offer snack food too, fish balls (in curry sauce) and beef balls (in satay sauce) in tasty homemade sauce, mild or spicy.

I am a card-holding long time customer, and will remain so."}
{"text":"Whenever you see a hoard of Chinese people lining up... its an indication of 1 of 2 things:

1.  This place is really damn good
2.  The food is really cheap!

I've always passed by Food Jungle as it is tucked away towards the back of PMall, and I've always stuck to the bigger names (Ten Ren, Tea Shop 168).  However, my friend convinced me to try this place out because there's always a lineup.

The rumours are true... This place IS really damn good!  I got the Green Tea Milkshake, and it really did taste like a milkshake!  Not that powdered, artificial crap you get from the other bigger and known places... 

The tapioca pearls were just the right level of mushiness and the milkshake was bursting of creamy goodness and green tea flavour.  I will forever be a loyal fan of Food Jungle from now on!"}
{"text":"Food Jungle recently moved to the 2nd floor at Pacific Mall, right beside Beard's Papa. Definitely a lot more line-up space and the girls behind the counter can actually move around, compared to the other cramped location.

The cost may be slightly higher than other bubble tea places, but it is well worth it! Real fruit juices. No added powder. This is the real deal and it tastes great.

There are lots of different flavour combinations, all listed along the menu, as well as a TOP 10 list. The all-time favourite has to go to lychee. 

They also serve side dishes (curry fish and beef balls) and it's a great combination with a fresh, tasty drink on hand."}
{"text":"Food Jungle is tucked away towards the back of P-Mall.

Rumors of greatness are apparently true as this place delivers in terms of taste & cost, super good food for super inexpensive prices.

 I got Taro milk tea, & the taste was most authentic as it had actual taro in it...no cutting it with powder whatsoever, big plus!

Tapioca balls were prepared correctly as core softness was optimal & outer layer was firm.  

I will always come back to this place when I am peckish for food or beverage."}
{"text":"Sadly, due to impending renos in the Pacific Mall & Market Village area, a lot of shops have moved or closed down.

So here's an update on the Food/Fruit Jungle chain:

1. The Market Village location of Fruit Jungle has closed.

2. The Pacific Mall location had relocated to the upstairs food court. BUT will also be closing as of September 6th.

3. Remaining 3 locations will be open as usual: First Markham Place, Splendid China Tower, and Dynasty Center."}
