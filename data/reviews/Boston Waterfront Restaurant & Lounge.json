{"text":"The Boston Waterfront restaurant is no longer open, due to flood and ice damage from the winter of 2014··2015."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The plans were very unorganized. We were trying to have a family get together for about 40 people. The prices were a little steep for the food and service was poor. Meatballs were very good but the rest of the food was lacking for the price. One server for our group and the restaurant. They moved us indoors since the weather cooled off, but they also had a band playing right next to us. They started playing around the time we were finishing up. They then insisted on trying to charge every one our group a cover charge for the band. No one came to see the band and we were fine just shouting to each other and racking up a bar tab. Apparently that wasn't enough, so they insisted on stopping everyone to pay a cover. Terrible service, which is a direct result of management."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive because I read the other reviews and I was going for dinner, not drinks. We were seated on the main deck and as expected the service was a little slow. One waiter servicing about 12 diners.  The waiter was good though, there was a large group inside and the kitchen was a little slow. The waiter apologized but he did his best to keep us cared for.  The fried portabella mushrooms with the Tiger Sauce were very good. The entrees came hot. The chicken Marsala was very good and the Cajun Chicken Pasta, though not the epitome of Cajun was very good as well.  It was a pleasant evening and we were very satisfied."}
{"text":"Food here is always good but the service usually lacks. Never have I seen an owner or manager. Staff usual congrats at bar. would come back to drink but not eat."}
{"text":"This place is right on the Yough! Beautiful location. Has been closed due to ice jam destruction.  Open now, weekends only. Live bands!  Food trucks! We went last week...good time!  Check 'em out!  Not far from the Boston Bridge! PA not MA!"}
{"text":"Overall, The Boston Waterfront is more of a bar than a restaurant. That's not to say that the food isn't good, because it is; I've had steak and burgers and both are very good. The atmosphere of the place is also pretty neat being that it's on the water and has its own boat dock. However, from going there I can say that they cater more to bar patrons than to restaurant patrons. They have several decks, which are a great place to have a beer in the summer, but the service (if you're getting food) is abysmal. This isn't really the staff's fault: there's only one bartender and one server for a deck that can seat 100 people. If you're looking for a cool place to have a drink, then the Boston Waterfront is a good choice. If you're looking for dinner, however, then you may be there awhile. I would have given four stars if it weren't for the service."}
