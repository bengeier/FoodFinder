{"text":"Wife and I found it after renovation. Great ownership that gets his hands dirty. First visit was best burger EVER.  Since then... eh not as much.  I know its a bar and their money is the drinks but do the fries have to be THAT salty?"}
{"text":"Such a great place! We came across it by accident and are so glad we did! Our group had the buffalo chicken wrap, boneless wings, 'The Hangover', cheese pizza, chicken BBQ nachos, and fried mozzarella. Everything was delicious and the servings were perfect."}
{"text":"Nice place, recently remodeled. Food is great. Pickle fries and inferno burger are delicious. Reasonable prices. Small local feel with friendly fun staff. Great place to hang out watch some sports and have a beer."}
{"text":"Great place to get a quality burger. Good, efficient service. Not many places with good food around the Macedonia area, I highly recommend this place. There are veg. options on the menu, (I believe it was a black bean burger), which I didn't try, but if it's half as good as the beef burger, it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This is a great little sports bar. My girlfriend and I had burgers (bacon & cheddar burger and she had a blue cheese burger). Burgers were cooked correctly on a nice brioche bun.   Now I am a french fry lover. Most places that make fresh cut fries do not cook them correctly and you end up with a greasy mess. To get a perfect french fry you have to cook them twice. I won't bore you with the details of how and why that is but the Beer & Belly does them correctly so you get a nice crispy outside and a tender inside without the greasy mess!  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"This was our visit here. We stopped in after a long day of hiking and didn't know what to expect. Glad we found this place. There were 4 of us and we all ordered burgers. Each burger was made to order and done just right. The atmosphere was also great with football games on the tv for us to all enjoy. Our bill was pretty reasonable also give that we all ordered burgers, drinks, and an appetizer. We will be back to enjoy more!"}
{"text":"2 of us stopped in for food and a few drinks.  First visit for me, he'd been there before.  Clean environment, well lit, a little on the small side even tho my friend said they had recently expanded.  TV's everywhere.  Menu had a decent selection, my friend ordered wings and I ordered a burger.  Surprised and pleased that I could order a burger without a bun (yeah, I know... it's not really a burger then... but I never eat the buns anyway).  Burger was tasty, had a baked potato side and it was not dry or overcooked.  My friend enjoyed his ribs and the sauce.  Beer selection was good.  Good mix of micros and bar standards.  One downside was food prep was a bit slow.  Place was mostly full when we got there, but it looked like many had already been served and in fact, by the time we got our food, most of the tables were empty.  So keeping that in mind, there couldn't have been many orders placed when our order was taken... it just seemed like a longer wait.. maybe it was the baked potato holding things up...  But all-in-all, decent food, decent prices, clean, good (but not amazing) choice of beers..I would go back."}
{"text":"Love going there. Food always fresh and delicious. Many TVs, cleanest bathrooms, we love one of the owners, very personable and super nice."}
{"text":"It's delicious... owner was very caring and attentive. Always love seeing a boss getting his hands dirty. Great place !!! Taylor  are waitress was so swift. We called her Taylor Swift!!!"}
{"text":"Total love to our fellow Yelpers who directed us to the Beer & Belly on our bowling night!!  We stopped in to have wine/beer prior to bowling on our weekly league.  We were early enough to beat the legendary crowds so we got in and out much faster than we thought we might.  First of all the place is well-lit (not my preference) but we snagged a booth along the wall that afforded us the proper dim lighting for playing Keno and tipping back two drinks prior to eating and bowling.  Burgers?  They cook 'em to order.  Tater Tots?  They have 'em.  Lovely waitresses and the place seems like a family-owned restaurant.  Patrons are comfortable here!  I had hot chicken wings with loaded tater tots... Ray had a BLT with onion rings.  We loved this place so much that we came back a week later!  We highly recommend this TV-stocked, comfy sports bar to eat, drink and be merry while watching Sports Center."}
{"text":"Went with a group of seven, four adults and three children on a Friday night. Was able to call ahead and get tables reserved for 8pm. The Friday special is a 10oz strip steak with two sides for $9.99! Three of our group had the special and loved the steak. I had the baby back ribs. The ribs were tender and the sauce was delicious! Tangy, but sweet. One side option is tater tots! A big plus. Staff was attentive and helpful. Our table was inside, but the patio with fireplace looks nice. I would recommend this place as a great alternative to the local Winking Lizard. We will be returning again!"}
{"text":"Typical sports bar that serves average food with pleasant waitresses. The place doesn't smell and it's not a dive. That's a plus to me."}
{"text":"Service was awful and slow. Server was pleasant but seemed overwhelmed. Asked for the tv to be put on in the outdoor area, never happened. It's a sports bar for God sakes! Food was so so, but screwed up the order. Still waiting for my drink ."}
{"text":"Strip mall restaurants terrify me. I trusted fellow Yelp reviewers and am now adding my own 5 star review. This place was incredibly clean! The Sunday server/bartender Victoria was very friendly and attentive. The food was amazing! In our party of 4 we had a chef salad, burger, wings and tater tots. The chef salad appeared to be very fresh and my daughter loved it. Same on the burger which my son ate every bite of. My husband and I shared wings and tots. The spicy bbq and mango habanero sauces were both very, very good. Both a bit spicy but very flavorful. We were all very pleased."}
{"text":"The roller ball on the golden tee is so clean you could perform surgery and use it to rest your tools.   The decorations are a cross between a castle and a yard sale at OJ's house.   Cold beer on tap and glasses appear to be clean.   And then comes the meal. Good god and his team of angels it was amazing. Grilled Cheese Burger. The buns are freakishly long grilled cheese sandwiches. Jaws would needs a few rounds on this sucker to get it down. Trump could build the with just a dozen of these.   They even have malt vinegar at each table!!!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick lunch bite.  I was in town on business and didn't know where to go.  Yelp app pointed me hear so in I went.  Great burger.  Its just a small bar and I was 1 of 6 people in there including 2 employees.  They had a special on pizza and it looked good but I wanted a burger.  Bartender was friendly.  Only complaint and it isn't there fault is cell service is terrible right there.  If I am back in town I will get another burger here."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant and sports bar in a shopping strip. There is a patio outside in the parking lot with a nice stone fireplace... not the ideal ambiance for such a structure, so I'm not sure what they are trying to do with that except appeal to their smoking customers. Inside there are TVs all around, so it would be an ideal place to catch a game and a bite to eat.   I'm not sure I'd go here JUST for dinner as the food wasn't that great. There were a couple things that stood out as really nice. It was good for the price though and the menu, the beer and the wine selection were large. The draught beer list was diverse and there were several more craft beers available by the bottle. The liquor selection was vast and they had several foo-foo flavors to make a variety of fun sweet cocktails that my daughter likes.   The service was attentively casual and friendly. The environment appeared clean. Our server made appropriate suggestions and was engaged. By the time we left there were a few groups waiting to be sat, which there wasn't really any room or space designated for, so they seemed to be hovering around diners. That would be awkward if you were in those tables closer to the door. I'm not sure I'd wait to have dinner here anyhow, as I said earlier, it's more of a bar with decent low-priced food.   We ordered two appetizers, four meals and four alcoholic beverages and the bill came to $73 with tax, before tip. Each meal came with one side. The fried pickles were yummy and different than the breaded chips most places have. The quesadilla was really tasty. The broccoli was fresh. The fresh cut fries were really good according to those that had them. The tots were from frozen and the cheese option was a jarred cheese sauce with bacon bits. The black bean burger had some good spice but did not have an adequate binder, so it crumbled apart as you ate it falling out of the bun. The bun was fresh and good. The tuna tacos were over powered by a sweet chili glaze. The fish was breaded with cornmeal without a lot of flavor but it was perfectly cooked.    As a sports bar, which I think this place is, they are four stars. As a restaurant, which I think, in some respects, they may be confusing themselves as, they would get a two to three star rating.   I'd definitely come here to drink, snack and watch some games. Focus on that and I'd recommend Beers & Belly!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner after gambling at the Rocksino. I always check Yelp reviews before eating at a new place. Well the reviews certainly didn't disappoint, this place was really good! I ordered the steak special and my husband & son each ordered a burger, all of our food was delicious and the service was Outstanding!! The waitress was so friendly and came back to our table several times to refill drinks and check on us! We will definitely be back when we're out that way again!"}
{"text":"-Easy To Miss, Hard To Forget-  Last time I visited this place was before the remodel. The old setup (from what I can remember) was cramped, outdated, seemed even a bit rundown. However, since they remodeled it, it's more open, clean, and you don't feel shoved up against a wall or another table.  My parents have always raved about this place and I finally decided to give it another shot, and I will say that I'm impressed. Cheerful, and attentive staff, a nice clean and current atmosphere, and good food. Seating was quick and we were able to order right away.  I ended up getting the Belly Boy (I'm guessing it's their signature burger) with a side of fries. The menu was easy to navigate to find something that would fit your taste. Although it took a while for the food to actually arrive, it was fresh and delicious. The fries are similar to what you'd find at a fair. You receive plenty of them and they're spectacular. The sandwich seemed almost like a high quality Big Mac (minus the onions, extra bun, and extra patty). That's not a bad thing, it tasted great.  There isn't much to complain about. As I said before; the food did take a little while to arrive at our table, but it wasn't so long to even really complain about, and it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with my daughter. We enjoyed every minute. The place looks great very fancy! The fire pit thing is gorgeous. The guy who took care of us was very attentive and caring. The food was very delicious. My daughter even wants to come back and she is picky! Food was slightly pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"The hand dipped chicken fingers are amazing. Food was really good. Service was fast. A little loud but is a bar.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, so many TV's for any sporting event. A lot bigger than it seems on the outside. Highly recommend the Hangover burger"}
{"text":"I had \"The\" grilled cheese burger and the burger was pretty good. I paid $1.99 extra for the cheesy tots and it wasn't worth the extra cost. The tots themselves were good, but the extra money for cheese and bacon bits isn't worth it. In fact the bacon bits kept them at 4 stars. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Awful service!  They were cleaning to close the kitchen at 8 on a Sunday night. I hurriedly ordered hot wings, which were deep fried wings covered in Frank's Red Hot. Then they basically ignored me while I ate and made me feel like I was interrupting their closing procedures. Bad experience. Don't Go!"}
{"text":"Pulled over on way to Cleveland and very happy with our choice.  The burger was delicious and the best tater tots I've ever had.  Definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"It's like my own slice of Frogtowns Johnny's in Cleveland.  For Cleveland people who care, that's a reference to a fun little sports bar in Toledo, specializing in good food and a good time.  It's not an exact replica, but the feel is the same.  They have daily specials that are really good, ranging from steak to wings.  We prefer the sandwiches.  The wings are pretty good, but the sauces I've tried are only okay.  For some reasons the servers can never remember the beers on tap.  Must be too many of them.  But they are usually very nice and attentive.  The bar area is actually quite small, as is the dining area but we have never had an issue getting a seat."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here since the renovation. Boy did they make this place amazing. It used to be an Irish Pub that we liked but after years of eating lunch there, wanted to try new places and different menu items. We had the afternoon off and stopped in for sentimental reasons. So glad we did. Lots of draft choices and a huge menu. We sat on the patio like we used to and had a great experience and really enjoyed the Tater Tots and pizza - we were loving the tots so much we ordered more. The inside has an amazing sports bar feel with a ton of TVs. Just a super renovation and food that will have us coming back."}
{"text":"Read the reviews here and decided to give it a try - great choice!  We're from out of town, came to visit the Hard Rock Rocksino (great place, too!) but needed a place to unwind, catch some football, and have a few beers. Perfect! Flat screen TV's in every direction. A great local vibe. Make sure you ask for Taylor (our waitress), to say this woman knew her local suds would be the understatement of the year - phenomenal! We had the Buffalo Chicken skins first which were flat-out great. I had the Patty Melt and my two pals had burgers - oh, yes - it was Burger Night so there you go! Really, if you're staying locally or passing through, hit these folks up - you will definitely not be disappointed.  They are doing it right!"}
