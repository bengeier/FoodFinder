{"text":"Bartender was great, food was average bar food at best. 

Good for a glass of vino before you go up to your room at the FOUR POINTS.

That's about all"}
{"text":"This is probably the best hotel resternaunt I have ever went to. I was staying at the hotel and I went there to grab a bite, and it was great. I had the steak and every aspect was amazing."}
{"text":"Staying at the attached hotel. Food was simple, but good. I had the Chilean Sea Bass.  It was fresh and cooked properly. The vegetable side were rice and large cuts of peppers, carrots and broccoli.  It was tilted towards an Asian dish. Just OK. The staff was very friendly and the service was excellent (sitting at the bar). Price to value on the food is the reason for 3 stars over four. Portions are good but price was high for the entree. Could be a loud, open environment if full to capacity.  Quiet week night."}
{"text":"Great food especially chicken curry and tacos.
Better than a lot of Indian restaurants.
Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I normally never go to any restaurant in a hotel. I find that the only consistent thing is that the good is expensive. However after a long flight and without any other options around me I decided to give this one a try. 

There is a clear bar section and a dining section. This makes it very nice if your in either a socializing or just dining mood. The atmosphere has a classy feel to it except for the small tv's in some of the booths that were always showed a lot of static. It felt very out of place. 

The service is very good and attentive. They were helpful and did not pester with to many questions. 

When my food came however I was not very impressed. I had the ribs and wings on the entree menu. The ribs were overlooked and tough and the sauce wasn't very flavourful. The wings were ok but for a $30 meal I was expecting much more. 

All in all my thoughts of hotel restaurants stays the same. The only consistent thing is the price."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, wonderful hospitality and good price. All you need for a great evening out."}
{"text":"Amazing for a free breakfast, the waiters are really nice friendly and its great to interact with such people early morning :)! Custom made omelette fresh fruits and nice tiny patatoes .. Nice breads, and danishes great variety of cereals .. I always stay at sheraton four points on Argentia Road because of this restaurant ! I enjoy it"}
{"text":"Don't let the other reviews deter you from dining here. The old saying goes 'You get what you pay for', and that indeed is true here. The rib eye was fantastic, rivaling many steakhouses cut. It barely had any fat and had the perfect sear.the garlic mash were good, as we're the roasted vegetables that accompanied the meal. We ordered the chicken wings plain with the sauce on the side. We're glad we did, they were delicious plain. Beware - The brie was bitter and disappointing. I ordered downstairs but was exhausted  from a long day. Pam was great, she let me order, pay and delivered the meal to my room. We will definitely dine here again."}
