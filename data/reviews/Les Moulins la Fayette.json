{"text":"Stayed at the Westin in old Montreal this weekend with my parents and we loved this little bakery. Ate two breakfasts and a lunch here and thoroughly enjoyed the convenience, high quality and service of the owner and his family (and other employees). Very friendly people! Try the quiche, croissants, and sandwiches. You won't be disappointed. I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Excellent bakery and cafe. The panini sandwiches were inventive and delicious. Love the dessert selection. Lovely location, off of the Westin hotel lobby. The staff was friendly and helpful. Nice sized dinning area, complimentary cucumber or mint water. We enjoyed our lunch here."}
{"text":"Très bonnes pâtisseries !Tres occupé pour un dimanche matin !Victime de leur succès,il  y a beaucoup de clients et on doit attendre. Pas Grave ...Quand  on mange bien !Bonne  Chance et bon succès pour l'Entreprise!"}
{"text":"Not really a guy that takes to coffee places, but was here with a friend over the weekend.  Not a bad place, stylish and very clean. They have a very nice selection of pastries, coffee and lost of kinds of tea. They also sell all kinds of specialty and organic products, so high quality products.  Ordered a croissant and camomile tea. Both were very good.  Would definitely go back if in town and with coffee lovers in tow."}
{"text":"This place gets one extra star for convenience for Westin guests. I walked out the main entrance and circled the block to enter. I only realized that I didn't have to leave the hotel at the end, when I used the Westin facilities.  Not uber crowded on a weekday. Above average coffee and ok croissants. Expect an above the average deli croissant with slightly above the average ham and cheese. Sadly nothing to write home about but I would definitely pick this place in a heartbeat over Starbucks, if I were rushing to the airport or if I slept above it and needed to start the day full and on point without hassle."}
{"text":"Modern, contemporary, spacious, relaxed, light. Self serve flavored water.  Orders made at the counter but drink and food brought to your table. Silverware is self serve. Nice big windows look out to clean sidewalks with architecturally interesting buildings.  Food is presented in pleasant way.  My Danish was delicious. Quiche was perfect."}
{"text":"We only found this on our last day in Montreal :(.  Everything was great - Egg&Feta sandwich and creamy quiche and great coffee.  Modern decor."}
{"text":"Almond croissants to long for!  My new wife and I were fortunate enough to stay a block from here on our honeymoon, and to discover this place the first day. Four days in Montreal, four visits to this shop. We sampled a number of pastries, which were all awesome, but kept returning to the almond croissants and Paris-brests. (Of course, if you long for an almond croissant all day and then show up shortly before closing, well, you will get to sample their also-delicious-but-not-as-awesome chocolate croissant instead. We were there early the following day!)  My wife reports that her coffees were very good.  If we return to Montreal, proximity to this bakery will be an important factor in our choice of lodgings."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to go back to Montreal for work and could visit this bakery several times during my stay.  Taghrid, whom I think is the owner, recognized me from the first time even though she has a lot of happy customers on a daily basis. This bakery is truly a hidden gem and the best place to start your day with a coffee and one of their delicious pastries or croissants. I cannot wait to be back!"}
{"text":"the three chocolate cake is really good! loved the mixture of the white, milk, and dark chocolate mousse! almost missed the cakes here because they only have a few different cakes a day tucked away in the middle of all the sandwiches and pastries"}
{"text":"Millefeuille passable : ne semble pas très frais (feuilleté tout mou), crème pâtissière farineuse, trop sucré."}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times since January. The place is spotless clean, very bright with large windows and tastefully decorated. I find the music to be a bit loud.   Their bread and food are very fresh. Their sandwiches are decent and they always have a few salads and a couple of soups. Most recently, I tried the veggie sandwich, which was too salty. The broccoli salad was also soaked in the sauce. The soups are great, especially on a cold winter day.   They have one or two water containers with mint, cucumber or lemon in them."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch while strolling old town, looking for a good alternate to the more touristy cafes in the main streets.   This is attached to the Westin Hotel and has a pleasing, open feel.   You can choose from an assortment of sandwiches, salads, quiches and soup a la carte or you can get the combo or box lunch, which we did.    We enjoyed a cup of tomato soup, a bean and vegetable salad and a full smoked BBQ pork panini.  Everything was delicious and fresh and for the full box lunch with a soda for the two of us it was $15 which made it very budget friendly!   Didn't try the pastries but they also looked good too!"}
{"text":"This is a delicious breakfast and lunch spot! Went for breakfast and had a quiche and shared a almond croissant- everything is clearly freshly made. Both were perfect. Came back for lunch and had their lunch special: a panini, soup/salad, and a small dessert for $12.50 or so. The bread for the paninis are so unique- I had an almost black bread with roast beef, pickles and Brie. This sounds bananas... but it was incredible toasted. I had the carrot soup with leeks- really a perfect fall soup that was not super sweet. The pecan tarte for dessert was sweet, sticky, and the crust was flaky and fresh. They also have two flavored waters for free every day. This is a perfect place to visit while near the convention center or in vieux Montreal!"}
{"text":"Great selections for breakfast. The highlight for us was the bacon quiche. Firm crust and melt in your mouth delicious!"}
{"text":"Je tenais vraiment à oublier ma première expérience de service à la clientèle de la semaine passée, donc j'y suis retournée hier... ET ce matin. Quelle différence! J'ai eu droit à un service à la clientèle exemplaire et d'un bonjour des employés (sauf de celle qui s'est occupée de moi la semaine dernière, mais bon. Peut-être ne sait-elle pas sourire? ;)).   Les Moulins La Fayette mérite entièrement ses quatre étoiles maintenant! Je n'en mets pas cinq, car selon moi, les prix sont un peu élevés (même si je sais que oui, nous sommes dans le Vieux Montréal et que les prix sont semblables dans tous les cafés du coin)."}
{"text":"Very nice modern looking place.  You can have lunch or just sit for a coffee and desert.  Excellent service - your order is delivered to your table !"}
{"text":"Popped in for late lunch on a rainy weekday in Montreal. I had the lunch special for $12+ which included a cup of soup, salad and panini. The ham, brie, mushroom panini was delicious! The squash soup was perfect for a rainy day as well. The following day my husband and i had breakfast and the grilled breakfast sandwich was good as well. Their prices are not cheap, a meal would cost around $15 with taxes but at least you get good food. It was located right by  the hotel we stayed in (Le Westin) so it was perfect. Update: We went here again on our last day in Montreal. After dining out for 3 days i take it back...their prices are way reasonable than most places around Old Montreal like Tommy or Oliver and Gourmando! For $15 you get soup, salad and an awesome sandwich! Definitely great value for your money!!"}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW:  Came here for our second and 3rd visits and if I could give this place 10 stars I would... Very convenient and just a small walk down the street from Hôtel le St. James.  Found out it is operated by a mother and son team. Pride of ownership is all around. Tried their chicken barley and broccoli soups--D E L I C I O U S! Ham, egg and cheese croissant for breakfast and of course their apple turnover and apricot danish--WOW!! We also tried their crab, dried cranberries and Dill sandwich along with their chicken, feta cheese and black olive sandwich. Very fresh, very tasty and all served with such care, warmth and love.   One final word. During our stay, we dined at some 5 star establishments that didn't come close to the quality, taste, value and satisfaction served up by Les Moulins la Fayette. We truly enjoyed this place and will miss it terribly!"}
{"text":"The pastry and coffee are excellent here. And I like the environment and the staff."}
{"text":"OK. So Montreal does amazing Sunday brunch. Weekday brunch a little hard to come by. We ducked into one place that was close by but opted out because it looked like they only served pastries and no eggs or other proteins. Stumbled across this place.  Almost walked out but then the server/cashier said they had egg sanwiches and quiches.  Went with the bacon and egg croissant.  The egg was pre-cooked with green and red pepper. Not too many to make it overpowering but you could taste them.  The whole sandwich was put together and then pressed.  It was good.  Ordered a mochaccino which was just okay.  Not a bad place to get a quick breakfast.  Servers are nice and it's clean.  But it's not Sunday brunch worthy."}
{"text":"My wife came here one morning to purchase some coffee and tea to bring back to the apartment we were renting.  When she purchased our coffee and tea she also bought croissants (and they were delicious). The next time we come back to Montreal we will definitely be heading back here for delicious pastries and beverages."}
{"text":"Best beef barley soup ever. Great place to grab an espresso and a decadent French dessert. Top quality food at great prices. Highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Quand vous sentirez l'odeur en entrant vous saurez que vous êtes à la bonne place. Pour une grande variété de pains, des viennoiseries sublimes et des pâtisseries démentes, allez faire tour aux Moulins de La Fayette du Vieux-Montréal. Vous ne serez pas déçu."}
{"text":"Super quaint little spot in Old Montreal that was great for a quick breakfast. Walked in because it was very close to where I was staying and was greeted with amazing service. Food (quiche and croissants) was pretty good and the vibe overall was great.   Definitely a good stop for a quick bite and a coffee!"}
{"text":"I stay in Montreal maybe 6 times a year, always as the Westin - I found 'Les Moulins la Fayette' because its in the hotel..... but i'll be damned if this place doesn't have the best croissants on earth.  I've probably tried croissants from 10 other bakeries in Montreal - nothing compares to these.  Usually my food highlight of every trip =)"}
{"text":"Great modern bistro. The wife and I came here for a light lunch. Coffee was really good. I am not a soup and sandwich type of person but the tomato soup and turkey sandwich on a croissant was delicious! Light jazz in the background so great place to stop, take a load off your feet and re energize."}
{"text":"This is a very busy little cafe right down the street from our hotel. Amazing Apple turnovers! Lovely employees here who saw we were struggling with the menu that was in French. He took the time to tell us what they offered in addition to what was in their bakery case. He also recommended their breakfast sandwich which was super delicious. Mine had fresh ham, cheese, beautiful ripe tomatoes, crisp Romain lettuce and a touch of mayonnaise. Very clean and an additional plus is the great music while you sip your coffee. Lastly, the gentleman behind the counter made some recommendations to us in regards to what we should tour in the area on this beautiful sunny day. Total package for me!"}
{"text":"The service was good here. Cute modern like shop. The sandwiches were mediocre. If you don't like a lot of flavor, probably a good place to go. Everything was displayed well for you to see. The coffee was good, too."}
{"text":"This shop had a back door into our hotel.  Glad they did.  Not much better than having a hot cappuccino and flaky pastry a few steps from your hotel room.  The people were nice, the coffee was good as were the pastries.  This was the shining light in our hotel stay."}
{"text":"I stopped at this amazing cafe every morning on my way to the Palais des Congress while I was visiting Montreal. The pastries are out of this world delicious and the coffee was good and hot (and they had soy milk AND almond milk!!)! The service was incredibly friendly. I can't wait to visit Montreal again, I'll try to stay near them again!"}
{"text":"Almond Croissant rocked. It was buttery with subtle almond flavor not- not at all over done. Lattes were disappointing - sort of thin and slightly burnt. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is modern and clean."}
{"text":"Comfy and clean place, friendly staff, great selection.  The breakfast sandwich and apple turnover pastry I got were delicious and perfect to start my adventurous day."}
{"text":"Cute little spot near our hotel at the edge of Old Montreal. Relaxed vibe, clean restaurant, friendly service.  Lots of fresh homemade treats. Order at the front counter and they will bring it to your table.  It seems to be on the horse drawn carriage path and the architecture of surrounding buildings is gorgeous.  Several of us enjoyed the bacon/cheddar/leek quiche and the others the breakfast sandwich. Good coffee too."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into Les Moulins La Fayette and that wonderful smell of their freshly made baked goods hits you, you know that you've found a great place to start your morning.  This lovely patisserie and boulangerie located in Vieux-Montréal, on St.-Jacques, across from L'Hotel Montréal. For those of you staying at the Westin (as I was), take the elevator to the third floor, then follow the dots on the floor towards the St.-Jacques entrance to the hotel. (Believe me, based on my own experience, do yourself a favor and skip the hotel restaurant, as it can't come anywhere near the goodness and quality of Les Moulins La Fayette.)  You'll have a nice array of breads and pastries to choose from, and during my four-night stay in Montréal, I visited LMLF four times - yes, it's that good. Their chocolatine (chocolate croissant) is amazing, light and flaky, still warm from the oven with the chocoate still slightly gooey, easily the best chocolate croissant I've ever had. Their croissant aux amandes (almond croissant) is almond goodness through-and-through, and it's so popular that one of their regulars waves at the staff through the windows each morning to make sure they save one for him before they all disappear!  You can also opt for a more savory breakfast, which I did on my second visit, having a grilled ham, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich that was just right, made to order and, along with their dark roast coffee, made for a great breakfast. They also make an excellent latte, strong and smooth at the same time - my compliments to the barista!  Their menu also includes sandwiches on their freshly baked bread, beautiful pastries, and a collection of chocolates, making me wish I had more time in Montréal to try out more of their creations. The café itself is quite comfortable, modern in styling, the perfect place to start your day with a fresh pastry, a really good cup of coffee, and the morning paper - exactly what you should do when you're staying in Vieux-Montréal.  Most importantly, the folks who work here are absolutely wonderful. The delightful woman behind the counter and her son (the masterful barista) greeted me warmly each morning, taking care of me as if I was a guest in their home. I'm looking forward to visiting with them again during my next trip to \"la belle ville de Montréal\"!"}
{"text":"This was a lovely cafe in downtown Montreal, connected to the Westin hotel.  We stopped in to warm up a bit after walking around the city for a while.  Kendal had a Croissant which was buttery, light and flaky.  She loved it along with a glass of chai tea.  I went for the apple turnover which was delicious!  Earlton finally settled on a custard pastry which he thoroughly enjoyed.  I had a mug of steamed almond milk as well.  The service was good and the only downside was that they closed at 3, we arrived around 2:15 but the place was so warm and inviting that we weren't ready to go.  (Smile)."}
{"text":"This place was visited by us on friday. We ordered a wrap, dessert ( chocolate mousse pastry) and a coffee. The food was quite good , Was very tastefully decorated, had nice bug windows and a good view of the street."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a breakfast to avoid our more expensive hotel breakfast. We had quiche and a choclatine - food was excellent. Full cold drink case, teas, kombucha, juices, etc. nice place to sit and enjoy a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Great service, nice staff, killer coffee + pastries. Quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a gem!  Absolutely delicious sandwiches and sweets. Just around the corner from Embassy Suites. Friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"We stopped here based on the favorable reviews and had a nice little coffee shop breakfast. Les Moulins la Fayette is solid all around, including a chai tea latte that has an actual bag of tea. We didn't get to try anything other than their croissant, but they were just what we were looking for! The staff is friendly as well. Also, FYI they have a $5 minimum on credit card purchases. Wasn't an issue for us, but just a heads up."}
