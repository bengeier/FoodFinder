{"text":"Staying at the Best Western very near the airport.  Licklider Is just a 3 minute walk.  Great for lunch...in fact it closes at 3 p.m.  Very extensive menu of lunchtime choices.  Food is cooked to order..no prepackaged stuff.  She will prepare sandwiches or salads just the way you like.  Not much to look at but it's the food that counts.  Certainly not gourmet, but there are tons of great restaurants in Las Vegas and this place is definitely more homebody with simple food.  It seems to do a big delivery and carry out business.  Apparently the locals like it."}
