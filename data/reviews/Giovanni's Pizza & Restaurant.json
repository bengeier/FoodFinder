{"text":"I ordered delivery from Giovanni's last week as a first timer. I was pleasantly surprised how quality the pizza was. It was also really nice that the lady who delivered the food was so friendly. I will be ordering again for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Our office just got Giovanni's and it also happened to be my first time having it. This is an instant favorite for pizza cravers of all types. There are so many great points about their pizza that makes it among some of the best in town. The service and delivery was quick. The convenience of their Uptown shop just up 5th Ave from downtown is a great location, especially since Uptown is on the rise. This place is bound to gain a lot more cred and attention over the next year for sure!

As for the pizza, the ratios of cheese, sauce, dough and toppings are great. We ordered multiple Cheese and Pepperoni and also a White w/ tomatoes and a Supreme. They even threw in a medium cheese and a bread twist for free! They included a nice sized garlic sauce cup in each box to drizzle on your slices. The slice has a great substance and is right in the middle in terms of stability. It doesn't droop as soon as you pick it up and it's also not stiff as a board. It's not super greasy either (as opposed to some places where the grease is literally dripping off). The cheese was cheesy and stayed on the slice when picked up and the crust gives you a great handle for ultimate pizza consumption. I'll definitely be having it again. Pizza for life."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE.  I went with the reviews and ordered a mushroom bacon pizza.  it arrived over an hour later and it was cold and soggy.  worst pizza I've had in a long long time."}
{"text":"Wish the 1 star review was accurate, but I waited two and a half hours and never received my order. Called to check on the status and they assured me it was on its way. If you can't make the order, then say so so that I can order from somewhere else and get something to eat."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!
We spotted it just as we were leaving town. Ran in, grabbed a slice each and ran back to car to eat. The pizza was so delicious that I had to run back in for 2 more slices!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Pizza is great and they deliver all over the city.  This restaurant is also on the Eat24 app, which is awesome (it even lets you tip the driver via the app). 

Buffalo fries are delicious and lightly spicy.  Hoagies are HUGE and normally enough for two meals (dinner & then lunch).  Pizza is a little more pricey than I would like, but very good - and there are tons of options. 

Delivery drivers have always been friendly and quick.  

I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Late night delivery was quick and the pie was great, fresh and hot! Couldn't ask for anything more! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Was searching for my favorite topping - green olives - to have delivered & stumbled upon this place. I could make a Digiorno pizza at home that tastes better than what I was given. Burnt in some spots, hard crust. Very disappointed. Added one star for having the topping I wanted."}
{"text":"The place is pretty roughed up but the food and service were great! If you're headed to the Consol stop here for good cheap pizza and beer. The crust was really light and airy, sauce was good too. $18 for two beers, 2 waters and a medium cheese pie. Can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a quick bite before a show at Heinz Hall. Folks behind the counter weren't really helpful. Only 2 options for slices, plain or pepperoni. Orders of pasta only come with salad, can't skip it. Salad was packaged early in the day and had limp lettuce. Pizza was forgotten, finally got there, over heated and blackened. Overall, this meal convinced us to not come back."}
{"text":"I come each year to visit family in Ohio, we come to Pittsburgh and see a firend and go
to Pirates and Steelers games, We always grab a  pie to go for tailgating before games.
Delicious pizza!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza wasn't bad. Took forever for delivery, though. And we asked for paper plates and napkins, due to us staying in a hotel. They said they would gladly send some, but they never came."}
{"text":"Got this delivered at the recommendation of the hotel we were staying at.  Medium Meat Lovers delivered for $19 before tip. Ordered on a Saturday night around 1030 and it was delivered within 45 minutes. A really good pie, loved the sauce, and enough for us to have two meals a piece. Would order again"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Great authentic Italian taste. Sauce is awesome! The sausage on the pizza is outstanding! First timer and will be stopping more anytime I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"First things first....don't take your kids here late at night looking for some rustic Italian pizza experience...its a pretty rough & tumble locale. Aside from that...I thought the pizza here was very good. I travel a lot to NJ/CT/NY and the pie isn't as good as some of the more famous joints in that area...but hey...your in Pittsburgh and not New Haven. 
Order the pie well done....tell them to basically burn it and that you won't complain and you will get a very, very nice pie. Plus...where else can you get a 40 while you wait for your pie? Bring change for the meter and the for the guy that needs 0.50 to get home."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. Jim and the kid in the window are always cool to chat with while I wait for a dope hoagie or delicious pizza. Definitely stop in, you'll be happy you did. Did I mention they sold beer?"}
