{"text":"The seafood was fresh, as one would expect coming from the Wholey name. However, the way the food was cooked left much to be desired. We asked for the wagyu burger to be cooked well done, but it came to the table burnt beyond recognition and inedible. Charring the meat to that extent defeats the whole point of wagyu, so you have to wonder if it's genuine, and why it was only $10."}
{"text":"First impression was great. The owner was standing at the door to greet us and shake our hands; very friendly. Unfortunately, it went downhill from there. We (my fiancee and I)  had a reservation. They acted as though they were aware of it, but it didn't seem like they had actually reserved anything for us.  After a few awkward moments determining where to put us we were sat but not given any menus; apparently all the menus were out even though the house wasn't full. We were given water and bread but no appetizer plates to eat from. After a longer than usual wait we were asked what we wanted to drink. There is no drink menu and when I ask about cocktails there were no specialty drinks- a long island was suggested. Then, there was a lot of waiting. Finally the two of us got ONE menu. Fiancee ordered oysters, waitress had to go ask about them, and she was not very knowledgeable of the menu. Oysters could have been cleaned better as there were pieces of shell. We were tolerating slow and substandard service because we'd heard such good things about the food.

I ordered the broiled cod which was supposed to be in a lobster cream sauce but tasted more like over-seasoned packaged brown gravy and absolutely drowned the fish. What I could taste of the fish and lump crab topping was good, but that sauce pretty much killed it. The mashed potatoes and asparagus side were very good, though. 
My fiancee had the land and sea. They didn't give him a steak knife, but luckily the steak was tender enough that his butter knife cut it (he also had to ask for a fork). He was satisfied with the taste of his meal, but felt the portion was small. We had the vanilla cheesecake for dessert and that, was delicious. Waitress never came back and asked if she could get us anything else, she just just brought the check then gave us attitude when we told her we had a groupon because she had to redo the check. 

We were excited about trying this place, but we were ultimately disappointed."}
{"text":"I had an excellent meal here last night.  I ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese.  It was unbelievable!  Huge pieces of lobster and a blend of several cheeses made this very, very tasty.  I highly recommend it.  This place is not much for ambiance, it definitely has a casual appearance with lots of high top tables.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal though."}
{"text":"We ate here last night, it was oyster Tuesday... Upon arrival they were busy and we were seated at a table where the sun was pretty bright/hot...our server Troy moved us with no problem. The wait was short, we started with six each of the featured oysters, they were SO GOOD/FRESH!! Then we shared the seafood pasta and the halibut/shrimp/scallop platter, everything was fresh, delicious... Fantastic food!! Our server Troy was friendly, prompt, and professional.. We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at this restaurant, only small complaint is they need an awning of some sort to help with the heat/ brightness of the sun. DEFINITLY recommend !!! YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience and I won't be back. The Decor....looks more like a college bar. My Dinner, Crab Stuffed Salmon, very dry and significantly over cooked. The Bock Choi, limp and no flavor and the potatoes tasted like something that came from a box. The waitress kindly offered to replace the salmon, but we were out  of time."}
{"text":"I  decided to give this restaurant a try after receiving a gift certificate as part of a cooking class and was less than impressed with the quality of both the food and service. To be fair: My partner and I are from a coastal region accustomed to high quality seafood and we ordered the two specials, ahi tuna and crab stuffed shrimp, in disregard of the basic seafood restaurant wisdom indicating that specials are often attempts to sell fish about to spoil and one should avoid them at all costs. These dishes, while not on the verge of spoiling, were nothing special despite the upscale price tag and left us unenthusiastic about Mr. Wholey's establishment.

The tuna was prepared \"asian style\" which meant slightly over cooked and bathed in some sort of bitter sauce reminiscent of cheap teriyaki. This was served with absolutely fantastic wasabi mashed potatoes and expertly prepared bok choy. It was hard to overlook the fact that the chef overdressed a cut of fish that demands simplicity and in the process, destroyed the delicate flavor I was attempting to purchase. My partner's dish was an improvement in that shrimp will take a chef's liberties a little kinder and featured another rendition of the great mashed potatoes I found on my plate. The crab failed to transform the shrimp, as the name indicated it would, and could have been otherwise better employed. We declined desert based on the weakness of our entrees but must say that the mashed potatoes were memorable.

The service was moderate to poor. I worked as a waiter for a couple years and consider myself sympathetic to the occupation and the skill it entails. Our server seated us next to one of the glass garage doors lining the restaurant face. This would have been fantastic had this door been open, allowing the pleasant summer evening to breeze over our table. The door was not open and thus subjected us to a greenhouse affected micro-climate in which both of us began to sweat in the direct sun despite the pleasant temperature outside. I know from experience that patrons are evenly distributed by a host/hostess to the sections assigned to each server and that our seating was not the server's fault. Yet why the server would not open the doors and take advantage of the day is either the result of a lack of skill and/or intuition or poor management. Service 101: comfort of the patron is paramount. Our server seemed to ignore this environmental negative (and the potential to turn it into a positive) despite having to shield her eyes from the sun when addressing us. She chastised our use of the gift certificate after our meal and indicated that she would use it as a favor to us but typically this would not be okay. To clarify: Luke Wholey was due as a guest instructor at a cooking class we paid for and did not show up, sending the gift certificates as a reparation. It was in no way acceptable for her to question a valid use of Mr. Wholey's self-serving consolation. I can only assume her hesitation to use the certificates was out of concern for her tip (perhaps she thought we would think the amount due after the certificate was our total in a tip calculation). Since she must have been capable of reading the clearly stated premise indicated on the certificate itself I am left to imagine that she is used to people tipping poorly and wished to avoid continuing this trend with us.

My final note concerns the bar menu. Myriad are the restaurants at which I can overlook lapses in cuisine or service so long as the bar is strong. Wholey's makes an attempt at a draft beer list with a few solid craft brews in among the tasteless masses and has several attractive bottled offerings. The cocktail menu features anticipated twists on standards but fails to indicate the presence of a genuine mixologist. The cucumber collins thoroughly proved that suspicion. This dry take on a tom collins featured fresh cucumber and utilized hendrick's, one of the finer spirits of this ilk. How one manages to f*#k up a cocktail with such a fine gin is beyond the scope of my understanding. A warm lemon soda water with cucumber is not an acceptable refreshment.

I will not return to Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille.  Pittsburgh may be too far from the sea (much less Alaska) to foster a great seafood restaurant or perhaps I just went to the wrong place. However, Wholey's failures went well beyond the plate and indicate that a systematic or managerial fault may be in play: Poor service, poor bar-tending, and poor environment compound as issues that are unlikely to be resolved any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE, the service stinks!  The food is just as bad as the service.  The waiter got my order totally wrong. Told me the tuna is served medium well, it was served RARE!  For the price and ratings I expected at least good food and service.  GOT NEITHER!"}
{"text":"Went to Luke Wholey's with my wife and adult son for lunch on Sat 10/11. Not impressed as there were multiple problems. My wife got a glass of sovenion blanc that was only tap water cold. her. Rather than serving the two soups immediately, the soups were served with lunch and the one was only Luke warm. My wife's French fries and crab cake sandwich were barely warm and it took us well over a half hour to be served. We were expecting much more. The buns were delicious though!"}
{"text":"Tuesdays is 1/2 off oysters so the sign outside the restaurant caught my eye. You can't beat $12 for a dozen! My 2 little boys had the chicken tenders and grilled cheese. First of all, the chicken tenders are made from real chicken (not like those freezer tenders or nuggets) and the batter was just the right amount. I had the mahi-mahi tacos and it had just the right amount of heat to it. My husband had the fish & chips. There were 3 good-size portions and there was definitely more fish than batter. My husband, who is normally a big eater, could not even finish even after I helped eat 1 of the fish portions. The batter is not the deep-fried batter and it was delicious. The restaurant makes their own sauce and this definitely even added points. I had the mahi-mahi tacos which on the menu it said you only get 2. I expected the portion to be tiny since they are appetizers but the portions were enough for it to be a meal for me. Finally, we had the pumpkin cheesecake which even with 4 people was a big portion to share. We had to take 1/2 of it home, along with the fish & chips. The icing on the cake for us was Angie, our server. She is the best server I have ever had. She was very attentive, always refilling our drinks (soda only) without us asking. We would be halfway through our drinks and in she comes with our next round, and even filling to-go cups for us. She was very friendly, and for her alone this review is more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great seafood with a kid's menu too!  We used our Yelp coupon for a free appetizer and then enjoyed some delicious entrees including halibut, the crab cake salad, the kid's fish sandwich and the kid's pasta. All were very good with great service."}
{"text":"I first went there for a dinner party about a year ago. I had a blackened shrimp & asparagus dish served over Jasmine rice and it was delicious. I'm not sure what happened between then and my last visit yesterday, but it definitely wasn't the same. Maybe they have a new chef? 

I ordered the same dish, craving that flavor I had last year. But I was sadly disappointed once I received my plate. The asparagus was limp and looked like it has been sitting out for a while. The overall flavor was definitely not as good either. A couple of the shrimp also tasted fishy (ie not fresh). Ironic when their seafood comes from Wholeys SEAFOOD market. :(

It wasn't horrible, but definitely not a great meal. Add to that, there were only 2 servers in the entire dining room, which was almost full. They were busting their butts, but needless to say service was very slow. It took us a good 15 minutes to get drinks. Not the fault of the servers at all though.  

I left very unimpressed and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Excellent choice for suburb seafood.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Luke Wholey's after hearing great reviews, and let me tell you I was NOT disappointed! I was happy to see that the restaurant was opened up to the sidewalk, which allows for some pretty entertaining people watching while you hang out and wait for your food.  We went out for an early dinner on a weeknight, and the restaurant was surprisingly full.  Another good sign.  The table we were seated at was a huge (recycled?) spool and that the walls were covered with colorful nautical murals. The overall ambiance really lends itself to a fun, casual seafood restaurant.

Our waitress was very accommodating and was willing to go out of her way to answer our questions. I went with two sushi rolls, the sweet potato roll and alaska roll.  The former was probably one of my favorite rolls ever.  The tempura battered, deep-fried sweet potato was topped off with eel sauce, making for one delicious sweet and salty combo.  I can't wait to go back and order it again!

This is somewhere I will definitely be returning to, especially while the weather is nice!  I would highly recommend bringing out-of-towners here to experience the Strip while dining on tasty seafood and sushi!"}
{"text":"Delicioso!!!! Un lugar para una experiencia. Los sushis de tuna no tienen nombre. La pizza de langosta y camarones lo tienen: exquisito"}
{"text":"Really nice place in the Strip district in Pittsburgh. Had a very flavorful lunch there. My wife had the biggest fried cod sandwich either of ever seen, and she loved it ! I had a fried salmon sandwich which was very good as well. Good service, decent prices. Next time in Pittsburgh we will definitely stop there again !"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh seafood! Great service as well.  Seafood restaurants in Toronto pales in comparison.  Ordered seafood pasta and a prawn dish, portion size is ridiculous,in a good way. Lobster bisque was heavenly"}
{"text":"This place is great and it's also very kid-friendly so that's a plus! I got the \"Three River\" which is your choice of three Maki Rolls or traditional rolls. The server was very friendly and the food came out in a reasonable time. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I've been to LWs twice now. They are now starting their seventh week.  Food 4.5/5.  Oysters excellent, grilled corn yum, shrimp cocktail massive, and creative/tasty drinks.  Service 2/5. Luke needs to quit shucking oysters and start getting his service straight. Long waits for drinks, food, and basic requests.  We watched four tables seated after us get drinks and apps first.  We thought our server was abducted by aliens she was gone so long.  Its strike two for me, but I'll give it one last chance. Better service, PLEASE!"}
{"text":"back in the burgh from out of town and stopped into Luke's on a Thursday morning, thanks to the suggestion of our Uber driver. heard about the place before but knew we had to drop in when i saw the outrageous Bloody Mary they were offering! and now I'm convinced that this has to be the best way to start your day! Brett behind the bar hooked us up with a deliciously mixed Bloody Mary with all the fixins, including two seasoned shrimp and a DELICIOUS soft shell crab to boot! it was amazing! flavor on the shrimp was a bit lack luster, but the lemon and seasonings used on the crab were on point! Brett was informative and entertaining and the ambiance was inviting. didn't have any other food, as this Bloody was a meal in itself, but would easily return!"}
{"text":"After a late Saturday night I was looking forward to an early Sunday morning Bloody Mary.  What I stumbled upon wasn't just any Bloody Mary but one that beat all others.  The combination of mix and spice was perfectly complemented with an array of garnish including two giant shrimp!!  

The bar was crowded but we were able to snag three seats near the service bar.  The employees and bartenders were extremely busy yet found time to engage with us and the patrons around us. The surrounding dining room looked as if it was taken from an Alaskan landscape.  This place seemed super cool. Unfortunately we were just having drinks but I'm looking forward to dining with them in the near future. 

Five star Bloody Mary!!"}
{"text":"I would have given Luke Wholey's 5 stars, but our waitress was inattentive and slow, despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy.  The seafood, especially the raw oysters were fresh as could be and were delicious.  I had the Ahi tuna entree and it was cooked perfectly.  Portions are very satisfying, which can be rare at a seafood restaurant.  Best seafood I've had in Pittsburgh and I would highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"seemed overpriced and not top quality. weak mixed drinks. the old bay shrimp were good. not sure if i'd go back."}
{"text":"The smartest thing Luke Wholey did was put his father at the door. He reeled us in promising to raise the bar on our seafood expectations. Epic fail. The reason for three stars was the friendly service and local craft beer selection. Food was pedestrian and lacked any taste."}
{"text":"The owner's father, Robert Wholey, spoke to us.  His grandfather started the fish market down the street.  He was a gracious host, the food was amazing.  This place gave us a great impression of Pittsburgh.  The crab cake sandwich and fried calamari were excellent.  Portions were huge.  Great, open-air casual space."}
{"text":"Staff didn't have much of a personality good or bad. I got blackened salmon with rice and vegetables. The food was good, the atmosphere was good as well. Seemed like a good place to get lunch, but not great. Overall I was happy with my experience  and would go back."}
{"text":"This is a great seafood restaurant and a cool spot in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is inviting and intriguing. My wife and I raved about the great food, as we were very happy about our choice. Had the special -- shrimp volcano, roasted potatoes, surrounding lobster bisque, topped with grilled spicy shrimp (aweeeesome)!! Also, make sure to try the catfish bites. Service was slow out of the starting gate, as there was confusion which waitress had our table. They apologized and gave us a free dessert.  Rest of service was great, and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place, huge portions, very good service and excellent atmosphere!  Fun for families but also nice bar for adults...we really enjoyed our lunch!  The seafood pizza and lobster rolls are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Terrible, we didn't even get to try the food. Put in our name for 4 people and was told 25 mins max wait. We stood in the small cramped waiting area and then went to check at 35 minutes and was told another 30 minutes. Staff was not friendly or accommodating."}
{"text":"Do you want an amazing culinary experience? I would have said I didn't care for oysters; until today. Delicate, succulent, delicious! Followed by the ahi tuna...nutritious, lo cal, delightful option. Topped off by the most genuine waitstaff, and Luke Wholey himself taking the time to talk with us...most enjoyable afternoon! Treat yourself...you deserve it."}
{"text":"Stopped off for lunch and was very happy we did.  Had \"highly stocked\" lobster in the bisque, light calamari with perfect marinara sauce and HUGE, awesome, flavorful and moist cod sandwich to die for.  Very happy with the attentive wait staff.  Even used a yelp coupon that was happily accepted.  Wish we lived nearby, we'd be here all the time.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent food with a great variety. The fried calamari was some of the best I ever had and the sushi was very good as well."}
{"text":"The BEST Bloody Mary's in Pittsburgh!   Hands down!  Tommy is a 'bartender' extraordinaire!  More a mixologist-superb!  Moscow Mule-unbelieveable!  Soft shell crab or large shrimp on top of the Bloody Mary's - it's a meal!

Don't waste your money going elsewhere in the strip - try the BEST first! 

We will be regulars now!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, crab cake was phenomenal. We ordered the calamari, mussels, three rivers sushi entree, Maui mahi taco, mini crab cakes.

Everything came out great and tasty, except the mussels, while it tasted delicious, there were multiple dead and stinky ones.

A older gentleman walked around and talked to customers, and he asked how everything was and I told him. He said it would be taken off, however the manager (different person) took off 50% for the dish after we told the waiter that brought our check at full price. Now I don't care about the $7.50, but it's more about customer service. I've managed restaurants also, and I wouldn't ever refund for a dish if there was no problem and it's just the customer being difficult, but the mussels were dead and there's practically nothing inside, except for the lining of the mussel. Don't tell me you'd refund me for the dish that you made with dead mussels and then not do it. It's a matter of principle, the money is not an issue.

This is the first time visiting Pittsburgh, and I heard good things about this place. Food was good, customer service, not that great. And customer service/experience is a big part of my dining experience. Waiter was good though."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Its great for lunch and dinner; get-togethers big and small!  We had my brother-in-law's wedding rehearsal dinner in one of the party rooms upstairs and it was perfect.  The food and service were excellent.  I also love this place for a party of only 2 or 3!   My favorite dish is the catfish bites!!   And I am a total sucker for their hot tea selection."}
{"text":"Food - the sampler starter  had 6 raw oysters that were mediocre fresh and some jumbo shrimp that was delicious. The seafood pasta entrée (i think the most expensive on the menu) was awesome! They overflowed the plate with all kinds of different seafood and didn't go too heavy on the noodles. The blackened shrimp and scallops were just ok. The sauce on the rice was too sweet for my taste. 

Service - I think the host might be Luke himself. He was very accommodating and checked in on us a few times. Our server was very friendly. I kept ordering beer that they were out of so they gave me a bunch of tasters. The bartender actually came to the table to better understand my beer taste so he can recommend the right beer for me.

I would definitely go back but will probably just stick to the seafood pasta. They say it's for 1 person but it's really large enough for 2. Maybe get an appetizer and the pasta to share for 2 people."}
{"text":"I had the sea food trio. The lobster was excellent, the shrimp was good but the escolar was below average. Bok choy had something like sand in it (not washed?). 
Service was fast. Staff was nice but not professional. Two of them did not know what they were serving. Not all drinks on menu were available. Nice place inside and nice atmosphere but ladies toilet was not clean (very early in the evening). The cocktail (Georgia Peach) was below average and the alcohol part seemed to be missing. For a dinner for two (with one beer and one cocktail), that cost around 120 $, they should make more efforts. I hope you have a better experience."}
{"text":"Must try the bloody Mary its a meal in a cup really didn't need to order that banging ass sushi roll however their crab meat sandwich was not as good as rolands...waitress was very accomadating even helped us move our shit to another table cause damn ... they got some big portions"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Everything I have tried was great. Simple said you can't go wrong if you like and want great food. It is pricey. But great food should be. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Pretty good sea food restaurant,especially for pittsburgh which is kinda far away from the sea/lake.
I'd like oysters there go with horseradish sauce! And my entree is the seamen,with crab on the top,quite tender and juicy, very tasty!!!
****Don't forget to do yelp check in and u can get a free appetizer!!
The dim light there makes me feel a little uncomfortable,but it's not a big deal."}
{"text":"Great entrees- blackened halibut and scallops/shrimp. Our server,  Kevin was great. The pumpkin cheese cake was delicious and the perfect size to share. Skip the conch fritters for a different appetizer. Decor- meh. Quick, friendly service."}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi fish tacos are fantastic for appetizers! Got sushi as my meal and it was pretty average. Such a lovely restaurant with really cute outdoor seating. I would recommend going but getting something other than the sushi."}
{"text":"Great food, the service on the other hand is pretty bad and it's not very busy in here.. Also my bf had a hair in his food."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and have loved it both times. Coming from MA, I thought I would be deprived of great seafood, but Luke Wholey's really delivers! Great happy hour specials and all around atmosphere, can't recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"We've eaten at many, many restaurants.  This one is definitely a fav.  Great good and great service!"}
{"text":"The space is nice and I think they'll improve, but right now a few kinks to work out. The crab chowder was kinda starchy and nothing special. The fish, shrimp and scallops were also just OK.  I had been hoping that with the family connection there would be simple, super fresh seafood. Not sure they have the right cook yet, or maybe an off night. The piles of fresh steamed crabs looked great, and it's a nice place to sit. But I'm super picky, used to work in the seafood business for awhile.
I'd try them again but they need to improve. My two friends felt the same way."}
{"text":"Jumbo bay shrimp appetizer - YES
California roll - not so much
Ahi Tuna, wasabi mashed potatoes and asparagus - Yep
Crab stuffed salmon, country potatoes and baby bok choy - Yes

Table chat with Robert Wholey - loved it
Owner Luke stopped by the table to see how our experience was - much appreciated

Waitress service - below par

Decor a little eclectic, but somehow doesn't work."}
{"text":"I had expected a top quality dining experience and got a prepackaged meal. 

Evidently, the meals are made-ahead and reheated. All I wanted was a piece of grilled salmon. This is NOT a culinary challenge, especially since they had salmon with crab stuffing on the menu, so I figured how hard is it to make the salmon without the crab? It's impossible, evidently, because the meals have been made in advance. This would be OK at a strip mall chain place, but this place is trying to be fine dining.

The decor was trying to be urban/arty but the art was oddly hung and uneven in quality, as if some actual art had been purchased but other pieces had been painted by somebody's retired aunt. Also, there is more to decorating than exposed brick. Just sayin. 

Drinks were very expensive (like New York City expensive) and the pour was very light.  Waitstaff was eager but sort of giddy. 

We won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience that we went back the next day for lunch. My husband was dying to try the Pittsburgh style lobster roll. It was amazing. I went with the catfish bites which were fantastic as well. I highly recommend this place. We had the same waitress the next day for lunch who provides us with excellent service again."}
{"text":"My husband came to this restaurant on a Saturday night expecting a good meal, however it was definitely over priced for poor quality.  The fact that the place had few customers should have been a red flag. The 'large' shrimp were not worth the price, nor were the 'large' scallops. The lobster bisque fries were disappointing - extremely salty, more like gravy than lobster bisque. I don't cook much, but I'm pretty sure I could make this meal at home. Our drinks were poorly made as well. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Would recommend the lobster , I loved it. Megan our waitress was cheerful and prompt. She gave outstanding service. I was highly impressed."}
{"text":"So the server was strange, must be the area though because I had a weirdo downt the street at Roland' s also...anyways the lobster bisque, best I've ever had. The sushi was something I've eaten from the local grocery. It was lacking but it did the trick. Outside of that I expected more."}
{"text":"Slim pickings in the area on a Tuesday evening, so this had to fill the bill.  Wish I had researched a little more....service was slow, took 5 minutes from getting the menu to any further attention.  Ordered the shrimp & scallops, took 20 or more minutes to get the entree even with a pretty empty restaurant and the shrimp was overlooked.  Wouldn't be my first choice for a return trip.  Meh."}
{"text":"First time here. Great meal. Sat at the bar and Jay was very helpful. He made some great recommendations. The tuna and Baja Volcano was excellent."}
{"text":"We had an awesome experience here tonight. I have to admit that I was a little worried based on other reviews that mentioned poor service. However, we had a pleasant, attentive server (Nikki) who was one of the best servers I've ever dealt with in Pittsburgh. Another nice touch was Luke Wholey coming out to greet every table. He really seemed to care about his customers, giving us additional information about our dishes. 

We all ordered seafood, since that is their specialty. I had a curry dish with lobster, mussels, shrimp and scallops over rice. It was nicely flavored without being overbearing. My wife had fish and chips which was also nicely done. The servings were big, everybody brought leftovers home. 

Dessert was cheesecake provided by A. Ward, who makes the best cheesecakes on Pittsburgh. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say-I have been all over the world and this place is among the top three restaurants I've ever been to. The oyster selection is immense. We tried three varieties, all spectacular, but the one the server recommended (wildcat) was probably the best oyster I've ever had. 

I didn't know seafood could be this good on the east coast. I cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"fantastic food and cute host, the spider roll is yummy,  and especially the corstini bread in the mussel dish is the best corstini I've ever had. Crab cake is so good as well, and i love their oyster combined with different two types which are fresh and worth to try."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat in Pittsburgh while in town for a graduation and found Luke Wholey's on Trip Advisor. I wanted to make a reservation early because I know how difficult it can be finding a place to eat in Pittsburgh without a wait during big events and the marathon was the same weekend we were going. We called a couple of weeks in advance and let them know we had a person in a wheelchair. When we arrived they had our table ready to go and a place specifically set up for our wheelchair.(very impressive) Our waitress, Heidi, was great. She knew the menu and gave us recommendations if we asked, We had a group of 8 so we had good sampling of the menu. The crab legs were delicious and we loved that you had the option of getting them cracked for you so you get right to the meat no mess involved. The oysters on the half shell were fresh and delicious, We also had the tuna which was high quality and cooked to perfection. Others in our party had the lobster bisque, swordfish, stuffed salmon, sushi and desserts. Not one person had anything left on their plate at the end of the meal. This meal was so delicious we were still talking about it the next day. We also liked the fact that we could get great quality seafood in a relaxed and semi-casual environment. We will definitely be back when we return to Pittsburgh so we can try some of the other menu items. i forgot to mention that the owner was at the door when we went to leave and asked us if we enjoyed our meal, he acted genuinely interested in our opinion. Oh and did I say anything about the Bloody Mary's and the house sangria? They were both delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out for drinks.  Nice open dining area."}
{"text":"The restaurant was understaffed tonight, but each and every employee was doing their best and made the evening exceptional nonetheless. Luke (the owner) himself came out and was sincere and accommodating. I don't expect a perfect experience everytime i go out to eat, but if a restaurant is having a difficult evening, it is negated by the fact that the staff and the management are sincere and doing their very best. Luke was very professional as was our server. I will definitely go back, and i highly recommend this restaurant. Not only for the food (which was phenomenal), but more importantly for the outstanding service and atmosphere. Thanks for the fantastic evening guys. It was truly enjoyable."}
{"text":"What a great place. My boyfriend and I went for his birthday and it was a great experience. While the decor is a little like a comic book meets crab shack, the menu, food, and drinks are definitely worth the trip. 

Starting off with or server: she was super friendly, helpful, and came at the exact moment we needed her. Starting of with drinks and the fried calamari, my gin cocktail was strong. Boyfriend got a Moscow Mule but follower our servers tip to add blackberry liqeur to it. Definitely was tasty and different. I got crab stuffed salmon which was cooked perfectly. The sauce was on the sweeter side, but I loved the mustard and ginger components.  My boyfriend got the BaJa Volcano with shrimp.   Mashed potatoes with lobster bisque poured over, then giant shrimp and grilled asparagus forming a 'volcano' shape. Not only did it look crazy, the shrimp were blackened and the potatoes were amazing. 

It wasn't busy the night we went, but it still had a good crowd. The manager, Ryan, stopped by to make sure our meals and service were good.  Very friendly staff and a great place to grab some good seafood.  

A good date night place. Next time I'll have to try the sushi or oysters."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on a Saturday evening around 6 PM.  Unfortunately it was a big disappointment.  The seafood chowder was the worst  I ever had - not sure it contained any seafood, it had too much starch in it and was lacking flavor. The shrimp, scallops and fish we (3 diners) had as our entrees were not fresh and tasted very boring.   The selection (about 6 different entrees) was too limited.  And the service was lousy."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to this place and while my meal was okay, I'll explain why I am only giving this 2 stars. 

When I first walked in I noticed that it was smokey, and it stayed smokey the entire time I was there. It was really distracting. 

Next comes the service. While our server was friendly, the time that it took for our drinks to come out was ridiculous. And it wasn't all that crowded there, plus we had made reservations so it's not like we just stopped in. We ordered appetizers at the same time as our drinks and those took even longer to come out. And then when they did come out, our meals came out less than 10 min later. So we were still eating the apps, there wasn't enough room on the table for everything. We consolidated the plates on our own big they never came and picked up the dirty plates. And speaking of the table, the actual height of the table was way too high for the chairs. I felt like a little kid eating at the adult table. 

Lastly, we told our server we had a coupon from Yelp for a free appetizer. I had checked in and had 4 hours to use the coupon. I showed her my phone and she clicked redeem now and then immediately clicked the mark as used button. So she didn't get the code or whatever she needed for the free app. I tried to explain that I couldn't check back in (because Yelp won't let you within a certain time period) but she didn't know what she was doing and I just said forget about the coupon. 

As for my meal, I had the sea bass which was a special. It was very tasty but others in my party did not like their meals. And I tried everyone else's, they were just okay. 

Also, while I did not go to the restroom, others in my party did and said it was dirty and there were no paper towels. 

I am a pretty generous reviewer. It really takes a lot for me to have a poor experience but this was really just disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch. I had the lobster bisque and crab Benedict. The lobster in the bisque was plentiful and very sweet. The bisque itself was very nice and creamy. The crab Benedict was excellent too. The home fries were damn good. Perfectly seasoned and even tasty as leftovers. To top it all off I had t he bloody Mary with candied bacon and fried soft she'll crab. The crab meat was sweet and tender and the huge Alice of bacon was the perfect blend of sweet and salty. The bloody Mary was also hands down the best mix of spices I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for lunch before a holiday performance. We arrived a few minutes late for our reservation, but they had our table prepared and ready. After waiting a few more minutes than I thought we should have, our waiter acknowledged us and, from there the service was fine - attentive without being intrusive.

My friend ordered the salmon beet salad and thoroughly enjoyed it. The salmon was cooked to the desired temperature She was pleased with how the citrus worked with the other elements of the salad. I had the crab cake sandwich. While the flavors were good, the middle of the sandwich was refrigerator cold. Hopefully, this was an isolated incident and not a matter of overall inconsistency. 

I would go back again to give the restaurant another chance."}
{"text":"All the staff is friendly and accommodating.  Bloody Marys are great.  Like a meal in itself!   Everything ordered always good.  Catfish bites, Shrimp Poppers, Lobster Bisque Fries, and the oysters are always fresh and delicious!  

Unlike others who state Bob on the Lobsterphone is obnoxiuos, I beg to differ.  I think it's a nice added touch and he is quite entertaining!!!"}
{"text":"We are from Florida. Found it hard to find oysters done right. Wholey's has figured that out. We also had the catfish bites and sushi. All done well with great service."}
{"text":"Love this place. The sushi was great and the salmon and swordfish were also well cooked, seasoned and nicely presented. Has a clean freak inside as well. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant based on all the Yelp reviews raving about the Lobster Bisque fries. If that were the only thing we tried, this would be a 1-star review. The bisque looks and tastes like brown gravy. We sent the fries back. 

Positives: Our kids liked the sushi rolls we ordered for them (crabstick/cream cheese and shrimp tempura - although it was full on breading and not really tempura - with soy wrap). And, big props for having stevia as a sweetener option for the iced tea!"}
{"text":"We dined at Luke Wholey's for an early Mothers' Day celebration and enjoyed the experience greatly. We had a large party of 10 and were placed in a private dining area which still afforded us a great view of the restaurant and bar below. (One small note:  the high tables placed at the ends of the large table made for a little awkward seating. )

The food was excellent.  Of particular note were the catfish bites and sandwich, the lobster fries, and huge peel-your-own shrimp. Everything was  nicely cooked and presented. There was a great selection of craft beers and the server knew the wines very well. 

In spite of some Yelp reviews we had read about the service, ours was outstanding. Our server, Brian, had only been working there a few days but was already up-to-speed on menu items. Everything came out quickly, especially for a large group. We enjoyed meeting front of the house man, Jerry, who made us feel at home.  We also had the pleasure of meeting Luke who told us how hard they were working to improve things. It showed and we will no doubt return."}
{"text":"Worst expierence I have had in some quite time. Main problem of our 17 ppl party 800 plus bill was told they could not help split the check. Been done with dinner for an hour now tryn to figure out the check. Multiple wrong orders. Staff is rude. 1 dinner that was 26 dollars consisted of 4 shrimp and 2 scallops. Like come on really. They get 1 star for bringing 5 extra shrimp. Place was like 100 degrees as well.   Update finally the owner came and gave us free apps and split the bill."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!

We went there on sunday 3.30 PM, crowded. Met Luke's father while we wait to be seated. He let us in (me and my daughters) so we could sit in front of this beautiful fish tank and enjoyed the view.

Drew, our server, was very very friendly and attentive. Apparently he likes the same band as my husband does. After knowing this fact, they talked as if they were a long lost brother. Lol.

We had lobster bisque fries, perfect! Salmon sashimi and oysters, fresh! And oh my god their steel city lobster roll, was insane! To my taste, it was even more delicious than the infamous lobster roll in lobster shack.

Would definitely be back here! Will have to try their sushi and desserts!"}
{"text":"The reason I give this place 5 stars is because of the service. I've always been leery about ordering water as some places require you spend money. I went in solely to catch some march madness and, when I was served water I offered two dollars and the server told me not to worry about it. He was very cool and civil with me. So I then asked for a menu and ordered oysters. He explained the two types, east coast and west coast stating the latter were creamier and more expensive. I ordered east coast and he put one west coast on there for free. I believe his name was Luke. Anyway, he was a very cool and down to earth guy and really made me want to spend my money there. Oh and the oysters were very good. 

I've been to this establishment before for various events associated with Global Pittsburgh. It's particularly nice summer time as it is open to the outside and in general is a good place for larger groups to gather and mingle. 

In regards to my most recent visit, the friendliness of the service and how the aforementioned staff member made an effort to accommodate me and make me feel welcome fully warrants this rating and as a result, I can see myself returning and providing them business in the near future."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. While the inside was unique and funky with decoration (approval).l, the food lacked the luster I was looking for.
The lobster bisque fries were decent but could've definitely used more lobster. $11 for a piece of crab and some bisque with a basket of fries doesn't get me. 
The tiger roll was alright, but not as flavorful as I had hoped - with 4 different ingredients, I would've expected flavor explosions in my mouth... Not the case. 
Their lunch specials seemed like okay pickings. They serve a ton of edamame with their meals."}
{"text":"Great food but somewhat noisy and slow service.
I would definitely come back and order the bloody mary."}
{"text":"I ordered lots of sushi and was very pleased with the quality, flavor, and freshness of the fish. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Friendly waiters, nice vibe, but food and drinks are not good enough for me to come again."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh fish - we had the combination of fish and steak and shrimp.  
It was served with greens that were very fresh and obviously locally grown.  

The cheesecake is locally made and fantastic!  Not overly heavy at all and worth saving room for.

They have a good casual ambiance, nice for watching a game in the background in the bar area.


Everything was good except we were charged extra for the shrimp and the waitress didn't disclose that."}
{"text":"The food here gets 5 stars -- Wholey's seafood is incredibly fresh and they cook it very well.

However, they have major problems.  At one point, they had one of the best happy hours in the city.  Good beers were discounted and several food items were also.  The specials were great, but they make you work for them.

First, if you get seated in one half of the restaurant, there are no happy hour specials.  So, if you order items that are half-off during happy hour, it will cost twice as much if you sit at one table compared to another.  Arbitrary and ridiculous.

Second, you will never get the half-off specials.  Every time I have gone, or anyone I know for that matter, they will charge you full price and you have to then ask (embarrassingly) for them to correct it.  I'm not talking about once or twice this happening, but literally every single time myself or anyone I know has gone here.   Once is a mistake, twice is chance, but after that it is obviously deliberate.  

In short, as much as I like this place, these shady business practices don't deserve your business."}
{"text":"Awesome dining experience in the strip District. shrimp volcano was delicious as was Lobster and shrimp pizza.  we also had mahi mahi tacos and sushi. Nice beer selection on tap"}
{"text":"I am giving this place five stars based solely on the Steel City Lobster Roll. Check it-- they take a buttered and toasted roll, load it with hot lobster, pile crispy French fries on it, and douse the whole thing with their excellently tasty and creamy lobster bisque. Why shouldn't you eat this? Why aren't you eating this right now? You deserve this. Go eat this. Seriously. I've tried bites of their other offerings, and they're great too. Drinks are good. Staff is always nice. On a reasonable day, they lift up the doors and you get a nice breeze and watch the people walk by with their Penn Mac bags, and discount produce. Parking is always awful, but this is a destination restaurant. That Lobster roll is a landmark."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant, Great Food, Great Service!

Yesterday was date night, which is a rarity!  I had asked around at work for some restaurants near the Altar Bar.  Everyone said \"Roland's\", so after work we made a bee line there.  It took 5-10 min. for the hostess to end her personal conversation with someone before she seated us.  After we were seated for 10-15 min. no one had spoken to us or offered to get us drinks...so we left.   A couple of blocks down the road we found Luke's.  From the moment we walked up to the restaurant to the time we left, we were treated extremely well by every single employee we came in contact with.  We got samples of Lobster Bisque.  It was delicious!  Our main courses were Mahi Mahi Tacos and Fish & Chips again delicious.  Can't say enough!"}
{"text":"Oyster shot was different. Unfortunately, didn't order anything else. Definitely going back for fish sandwich and lobster bisque fries"}
{"text":"Best most dressed Bloody Mary- the Ultimate Bloody Mary. Can't even guess how many times I've showed the photo to people. I enjoyed the fresh soft shell crab. I would like to have just ordered another one versus ordering food since this drink supplied enough food :) 
I ordered the beet wild salmon salad. Something went wrong with our order and it took forever to come out. They apologized and comped it by adding some steak to my friends back and eggs.
We sat at the bar. Service was very good. 
My salmon on the salad was overcooked. 
Would come back again for that Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"My friend and I have walked past this place multiple times and have always wanted to try it so on her birthday a group of us decided to give it a go. Two of us order the swordfish entree and the other 2 order sushi and calamari. Our food came pretty quick and everything was pretty tasty. The only complaint I have is for $26, the swordfish was missing something. It was in no means a bad meal, but I've had better swordfish steaks that I grilled on my own. I would definitely return to than restaurant to try another item on the menu though."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and loved it! We had the fried catfish nugget appetizer, the fried cod sandwich, and lobster sandwich with lobster bisque on top. Yum!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed out experience. Our waiter Kevin gave amazing service. Additionally, the catfish bites were great and our indoor outdoor seating allowed us to take advantage of a wonderful day. Enjoyed talking to the owner. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best ever Seared Ahi Tuna (sushi grade Ahi tuna, hot pepper crusted and grilled rare, served sliced thin on top of was a bit slaw, drizzled w sweet soy, and sprinkled w tobiko). Absolutely the best  delicious appetizer!!!"}
{"text":"I was sitting there holding a conversation with my girlfriend when all a sudden this old man who eerily resembles Count Dracula interrupted with \"have you seen the HBO series Deadliest Catch?\" , annoyed but still curious on what this guy felt the need to tell me I said, \"yes, why?\" ( I know it's not an HBO series ) he then continues to go on to tell us, \"our good friend Captain Wild Bill eats here every time he visits Pittsburgh and catches some.of the most delicious sweetest crab in the ocean!\" .... and almost as if he knew the people next to us had ordered a plate of crab legs (RME) here comes a waiter carrying a plate of .... wait for it .... CRAB LEGS!  I then told him how great they look and went on to drinking my bloody Mary and continuing my much more interesting conversation. Other then the cheesy used car sales pitch on crab legs the oysters were fresh and great, the . mimosas were perfect and the bloody Mary's full of flavor and garnished perfectly!  Hopefully the next time I go back the count will let the more then capable waiting staff handle the sale of the menu items."}
{"text":"Really liked the restaurant--affordable seafood but great quality, fresh ingredients!! Our waitress was very attentive and professional. We had a great experience and will definitely come back. Sushi was beautifully done."}
{"text":"The food was really great and fresh! We ordered a few appetizers and sushi to try some different things and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! They accommodated for our group of ten- Kevin was our waiter and was AWESOME! Extremely thoughtful and kind. The Bloody Marys are phenomenal and everything on the menu is fresh. Great experience!"}
{"text":"All and all a pretty good spot. We called for a reservation on a Saturday night and they pushed us back an hour. When we arrived the place wasn't  even half-full. The dining room was pretty cool but the flood lights on the ceiling have to go!  The baja shimp and scallops were very good but the service was even better. Our waiter Kevin went above and beyond and was genuinely sincere and friendly. He made our evening."}
{"text":"Everything from the host to the food was great. Very friendly server. Genuine. The Mahi and calamari tasted very fresh. The garlic bread was baked to perfection. The Bloody Mary so good. Would love to visit again."}
{"text":"Stopped by to treat my parents for lunch. It wasn't very crowded,and we were seated right away. However, we waited over 45 minutes for our food to come out, and they still forgot our appetizer. Food was good but not worth the wait or the terrible service."}
{"text":"Wish I could give a 3.5. 

Service: We waited a good bit before our server coming over to greet us and take drink orders. Once our server did arrive the service was attentive. 

Atmosphere/Decor: Fun and funky vibe. A bit loud, def not the place for an intimate dinner. Loved the murals and the decor. 

Food/Drink: I love hot tea and was pleasantly surprised by the tea selection. There was a speciality beverage menu but we didn't partake. There are two dinner menus; one sushi and one house. We started with the lobster bisque fries.  They were great. The bisque was well balanced, the fries fresh and large chunks of lobster. I had the seafood trio which disappointed. The fish was overcooked as was the lobster.  Instead of bok choy I received kale. My husband had the land and sea, again dissappointed. His scallop was under cooked. The steak was cooked perfectly. My son had the crab legs. The sectioning though convenient made them become cold very quickly. The mashed potatoes were a hard rock while the asparagus was perfectly grilled. For dessert we split the flourless chocolate cake which was perfect. It was rich and dense but melted quickly."}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary in Pittsburgh! Amazing restaurant in the Strip District, we stop every time we go down town"}
{"text":"Great Customer Service.

Peel and Eat Shrimp Was Amazing! The Size of the shrimp you wont get anywhere else, well..maybe at the beach...but no where else in this area. 

Lobster Bisque Fries Also Good.

Shrimp and Scallops! Scallops cooked perfectly..perfectly!!

Pricey.  But between the quality of the food, and the great customer service..it was well worth it."}
{"text":"A gem...We went for my husbands birthday .we walked in and the bartender came right out and seated us. very friendly .. the restaruant has a rustic look that was very nice the waiter (Euan) came right over asked if we had ever been there before.we told him NO. he went over the menu and gave his recomendations.
Well he said the  swordfish with roasted potatoes,cabage and bacon was his fav so I went with that and let me tell you,I am ever so glad I did.I was in food heaven. and the cheese cake was to die for I dont remember the correct name but it had apples and cranberries. As for my husbands meal I could tell you much except he cleaned his plate ...THANKS for a GREAT dining expierience...we will be going to eat there again and again and..............."}
{"text":"I ate here with a friend last weekend and have to say it was a good experience. I had the lobster roll and the lobster bisque. Both are delicious and have chunks of delicious lobster. I didn't give it 5 stars because the ambiance is kind of - odd.it doesn't seem like they put a lot of thought into decorating the place or the comfort of the diners. The tables are big spindles that are just awkward to sit at.

Great food but please do some remodeling!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh interesting choices. Good sushi 
Great service 
Lots of seating. I want to return"}
{"text":"For the last couple of years my work crew has had our Christmas party at Oliver Twist.  This year I called Oliver's & Luke's and there was no comparison- Luke was much more flexible and had better offerings for food so I scheduled our party at his restaurant.  I'm so happy I did!  It was outstanding and I received so many compliments from my work crew!  We had just under 30 people total at the party.  We had the party upstairs in the restaurant in the bear lounge and the bar upstairs.  

There was quite the spread of appetizers across the upstairs bar including salad station, catfish bites, crab dip with flat bread, veggies, oysters (we didn't even discuss oysters-Luke just gave them to us), chicken skewers, and any drinks we wanted...those catfish bites and that crab dip were so good!!!  Dinner was shrimp scampi, salmon, cod, mashed pots, and we even received 3 cheesecakes!!!

The food, the service, the atmosphere, the flexibility and friendly service of Luke & Jason (the manager) all receive A plus grades and this is easily one of a few top restaurants in town.  I love this place!!!  Highly recommended for parties upstairs."}
{"text":"Great hospitality and service from everyone on the staff! They were more than accommodating for our large crazy group."}
{"text":"Upon our return, in which we were comped a gift card, the service was excellent, the food even better! I have even received an apology from the waiter. This is my favorite place to eat by far! The oysters are delicious, the Bloody Mary will knock your socks off, the fish is delicious and even something as simple as the cole slaw made with wasabi is absolutely decadent!  I will be back many , many more times!"}
{"text":"We visited with a group of 8 for a celebratory dinner. It was restaurant week and we all ended up getting the deal. I had the crab chowder, Oscar filet and cheesecake. Everything was fantastic! I highly recommend the crab chowder, it was the best I have ever tried. Overall fun atmosphere, great staff and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Another amazing dinner experience with my husband. I don't think the food could get any better. Drinks are great too!
Do the YUM YUM sushi
Crab stuffed salmon
And key lime pie
..and you will leave happy!"}
{"text":"My favorite haunt on lazy weekends.  Luke's lobster bisque is the best I've had.  Monterey, Carmel, La Jolla, Fishermans Wharf San Fran, etcetera.  Yet somehow a fisherman in Pittsburgh has the best....by far.   Not to sell Luke short, the entire menu here is spot on.  The staff are happy and friendly. Brian is especially good. A server with friendly attitude and remembers your drink.  Solid all around joint in the Strip.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've really only drank here, but the bloody mary's do come with some shrimp and other sundries. 
Our waiter was the cutest thing, his name was Davin and he apparently does not work there any more. He was so friendly and lovely and warm. Plus he was SUPER complimentary of my friend and I, which is always a bonus.  
Luke Wholey took the time to stop by our table and ask how we were enjoying ourselves. Which was sweet and well appreciated.
My friend ordered some sushi which she really really enjoyed. She said it was fresh and delicious. 
It was a little expensive for what we got but, it seemed well worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered the seafood trio on the lunch special with side salad and it was fantastic. Salad was extra but entrée was $15. Great service and great environment for a casual date"}
{"text":"Luke Wholey's is a great place to stop in when shopping in the Strip on the weekends. Especially in the warmer months, I love the open garage doors and the fresh oyster shucking outside. There's not many places in the 'Burgh to get great oysters, but definitely Luke Wholey's is one of them. Especially check out their happy hour when they have 1/2 price specials! I consistently have had great fish here - fresh, delicious and everything cooked perfectly. The lobster bisque and the old bay peel and eat shrimp are my favorite starters other than oysters. I've also had salmon and tuna here that was excellent!"}
{"text":"Food and drink wise, there's much to love here.  We've gone here several times and the food has always been stellar.  Try their Bloody Mary, which often features a pickle spear garnish, pickled by the bartender himself!  A nice touch.

Service has always been friendly and knowledgeable; what has been inconsistent is the speed and attentiveness, both of which can be spotty.  When you do have a server's attention, all's well with the world.  Luke himself is often at the front of the house, and he's a warm, friendly presence there.

A nice room with a loft feel, good for people-watching on Penn.  A great place to bring out-of-town guests.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Went here with my fiance and group of friends recently and can honestly say this was one of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh. We had a couple of cocktails while we waited for dinner. They had a nice menu of customized mixed drinks, and they tasted good. Appetizer consisted on 2 dozen fresh oysters. Nothing fancy needed here, they were fresh, cold, and tasted great!

For dinner I had a the Wild Alaskan sushi roll. It was packed with thick pieces of fresh crab meat, and really satisfied. Other meals ordered at the table were the lobster mac 'n cheese (made with multiple cheeses that smelled soooo good from across the table!), baked cod topped with lump crab meat (it was melt-in-your-mouth), and baja fish tacos (boasted by my fiance as the \"best fish tacos ever\"). 

We rounded everything out with pumpkin cheesecake and vanilla bourbon cheesecake. I am not a cheesecake person-definitely a dessert person-just not cheesecake, but these were exceptional! Had I not already been so full from dinner I would've annihilated them.

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The lobster fries were delicious- only a true Alaskan Pittsburgher would make gravy out of lobster bisque.  Entrees of glazed salmon, swordfish and Parmesan encrusted cod melted in your mouth. Sampler of fresh oysters was an excellent suggestion by Kevin.  Truly impressed on my first visit."}
{"text":"food is meh, for the not-exactly-cheap pricetag, it's honestly unimpressive. I wouldn't say I'm disappointed per se, nothing tasted bad, but there are better alternatives, even in the vicinity of the strip alone."}
{"text":"We were so excited about this place and crabfest only to be quite disappointed. Got reservations for outside, got there early and seated inside. Fine, we managed. Then we ordered King Alaskan crab, oysters, and the cluster of crab legs (they were out of the Maryland crab legs which was the main reason we went). Again, we managed. Then it took WAY too long for the oysters to come out considering they were raw. It took over another hour for the crabs to come out. And sadly they were nothing special at all. We spent $100 and came home to eat because there was not a lot of food and it was unexceptional. We will likely not be back and wouldn't recommend the crabfest"}
{"text":"By far our favorite seafood place! Our favorite dish is the Crab legs, they are massive and absolutely delicious! I have yet to have anything here I did not love. The bloody Mary's are amazing. From the owner to the staff everyone is very friendly and welcoming. A must try for anyone in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Second time I visited here  and it was awesome. Started with a mix of west coast oysters. Shared the Captain Crunch Roll and had a Caesar Salad with wild Alaskan Salmon! The salmon was cooked perfectly. Our server Kevin was very knowledgeable with our oyster selection. He had a big section all to himself and not once did I see him struggle, fluster or forgetful. He let us know that Tuesday's are half off oysters and Thursdays are 1/2 off sushi. We will definitely be back to partake in those specials."}
{"text":"Service could have been a little quicker- went on a slow night.  Food was excellent!  Definitely will be back again for fish and chips.  Couldn't ask for better quality seafood."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner after a full day in the Strip and were told it'd be 45 minutes for a table for two. Fortunately it only was about 5 minutes!! Our server was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the catfish bites and lobster bisque. The catfish bites were disappointly not crispy on the outside, though they were still good. They would have been better crispy instead of rather floppy and soggy. The lobster bisque was yummy, but for a giant bowl we only got one little \"crustini\" I believe it was called. Two or three would have been better for the size of the bowl. My husband and I shared the two dishes, and it was plenty for us. The portions were great, and the prices weren't bad at all. I recommend it for sure.

An added perk was Robert Wholey (the owner's father) stopped by our table and talked to us for a minute. Later he offered us some oyster.  It was a great addition to our evening to get to say hello to him and meet the face behind Wholey's in the Strip!!! He was very kind!

We'll be going again!!"}
{"text":"After hearing amazing things about Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille for years, I finally found myself making the trip on over here to see what the fuss was all about.

Initially I have to admit I wasn't super impressed. At first glance I thought the décor here was pretty standard cutesy seafood place décor - silly paintings, fish paintings everywhere and on everything, a real fish tank, that sort of thing. It just didn't do much to set the grille apart from other seafood places. And I honestly didn't feel comfortable here during the first twenty minutes or so. The outdoor tables my dining companion and I sat at didn't have anything to offer cover from the hot sun; the indoor table we moved too was a rolling table that we were afraid to bump into for fear of spilling food and drink everywhere during our meal; and since I'd walked over from work the fact that we didn't get any water at our table until after we'd ordered meant that I was admittedly feeling parched and a little cranky while I waited. (In fairness, I'm not sure if our swapping tables and moving from outside to inside seating contributed to this delay in getting said water.)

So at that point I wasn't really feeling great about this place and didn't understand what the fuss was all about, especially since while reviewing my dinner options I was disappointed to discover that there were no specials, so the menu seemed pretty standard by seafood place standards. Plus the alcoholic drinks we sipped on were pretty so-so, so I honestly started thinking, 'Why do people love this place so much?'

Then the food arrived. Oh man. First the thickest, tastiest bowl of lobster bisque I've ever had was set before me. Then after that my ahi tuna appetizer came, and I was super surprised to find that it was delivered on a bed of greens. The menu presented it as fish only, but I wasn't complaining since that made my dinner more like soup and salad rather than plain old appetizer and soup. Plus, it was really, REALLY good! The tuna was seasoned as perfectly as the soup and both were made from some of the freshest ingredients that you can find in the city. My friend absolutely loved their scallops and shrimp, which I had a chance to try - and surprise surprise, I loved them, too.

And since I hadn't ordered a ton of food for my actual meal, I had room for dessert - which was the most fantastic piece of vanilla cheesecake I have ever had. Vanilla bean cheesecake + whipped cream + Bourbon syrup = a  true piece of heaven! I would come back just for a taste of that cheesecake again, for sure.

My final thoughts: as uncomfortable as I was before the food arrived, the food made me understand exactly what everyone's raving had been about when it comes to this place. If you're a seafood fan at all, a meal here is must. I honestly can't wait for the next time I get to eat here now!"}
{"text":"So Jillian and I are reviewing it's amazing restaurant right on the strip district in Pittsburgh - Luke Wholeys Wild Alaskan Grill.  We talked it over and decided this was one of the best meals we've had stateside - outstanding!! 

We started off sharing a sushi roll with my sister from another mister, Kristen Hancock, her husband Luke and their little boy Wyatt - a roll they call the Kitchen Sink.  Yellowtail, spicy tuna, salmon and tuna - and it was fantastic!!  

After that we all went into our zones and that's when amazing went into overdrive! 

Jillian had the ahi tuna, seared and topped with two kinds of tobego - one infused with lemon reduction that had her inhaling it. SHE LOVED IT!!!!!

KRISTEN did the soft shell crab sandwich and Luke the shrimp Po-boy and everyone had smiles around the table a mile wide.  

Im looking around checking out what the other tables were having - and the waiter made the decision easier for me:  I first decided to go with their Bloody Mary topped with spicy shrimp and maple bacon. It was so amazing I can barely type the rest of this review as my knees got totally week.  All of the olives, pickles and have of the maple bacon went to my co-reviewer -). 

After that I moved right onto the lobster bisque that was truly one of the best I ever had. Chunks of lobster crème fraîche perfectly mixed together into a fantastic warm soup on a beautiful spring afternoon.  But I wasn't done there.  Oh no, because on their menu they offer something called the steel city lobster roll - which is essentially an amazing lobster roll topped with their incredible lobster bisque as a bit of a gravy. So good, so good, so good!!!

The service was fantastic, they even took care of my pups with water under the table and we all had a spectacular spectacular lunch!  Id fly back to Pittsburgh food just to eat their food.  We really enjoyed spending time with Luke himself the owner who returns out at one time lived on 89th and fifth - just a few blocks away from me in NYC

Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Great/friendly service. Very impressed. Located right in the heart of the strip district, it's very convenient if you're in the area and need to stop for a bite. 

The food itself was good. Nothing that really stood out as being amazing but it was good for a semi-reasonable price. Drinks are a bit pricey for the area ($5/bottle domestic beer). 

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if in the area it's not a bad option."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I have to say that they serve the BEST bloody mary's! Located in the Strip district, visitors and locals walk the streets to grab a bite and drink til their hearts desire. We decided to take some friends here this time during Memorial Weekend and it was crowded. I did see one empty table up front and quickly claimed that spot and told the hostess. However, she said that the wait time would be 30-45 minutes. Say what? I ain't got time for that. It's a good thing we got a bite to eat before having our second breakfast. I told the hostess that we were only there for drinks and we would be ordering quickly. She obliged. Yippie! We quickly got seated and ordered right away!

Robert Wholey was walking by and stopped at our table to greet us. He was in civs so I didn't recognize him with his coat and hat but proudly stated that this was his son's place and that we needed to sit here as long as we liked because they need good looking people in the forefront. LOL I died... What a friendly man and yet he has a heart of gold!

Anyways, because it's not in season we weren't able to order the softshell crab with our drinks. But we enjoyed the tomato-y peppery taste of our bloody mary's with candied bacon, a large stalk of celery, and chilled shrimps. It was delicious. (mine virgin of course) It was worth it! I'm buzzed off my baby so it is all good! My friends really enjoyed themselves.

Other things that I have tried in the past were the lobster rolls (a must) and the key lime pie (better than the south! don't tell anyone i said that) and some other stuff. Overall, this place is a great place to hangout for brunch, grab a drink, and enjoy the day with your friends."}
{"text":"We were in the Strip District on a Saturday night and decided to try Luke Wholey's  we called for reservations and we were disappointed to hear that they were full for the night. Since we were in the vicinity we stopped by anyway, lucky us there were two tables available in the bar area.

We started with the Thai chili catfish bites; the lightly breaded catfish bites are fried but not heavy or greasy, they are paired with a traditional sweet chili sauce and lemon.

The sushi being prepared was very inviting and since soft shell crabs were in season we ordered a spider roll, the roll was fresh, the crab was delicious, a very nice compliment to dinner.

We then enjoyed the Mexican shrimp volcano, I asked if the shrimp could be fried instead of grilled and the answered yes but they arrived grilled anyway, also the lobster claw was missing. Our attentive server was quick to remedy the missing lobster issue. None the less the dish was good, the shrimp were large and juicy, using bisque as a topper for the mashed potatoes was also a nice touch.

For dessert we had the turtle cheesecake which was a delicious way to end our meal.

Will dine here again the next time I'm in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"My most recent visit here was to celebrate V Day. I was given a choice of my favorite restaurant and this is it.

Reservations were made for 8pm and we were seated in a good spot to catch action on the TV while we talked and ate. Our server was the same gal that served for my bday party. Her name slips my mind but she's really sweet. She ran through the specials and then left us to decide. I chose the baja shrimp and day boat scallops which is served with rice, asparagus and choice of sauce. I chose the lobster buerre crack, ummm I mean blanc. Lol it's very good.  The scallops and shrimp were cooked perfectly!!! The rice was a great accompaniment and the asparagus had a yummy char on it.  My valentine had the stuffed salmon. He really enjoyed his meal as well as 1 of the shrimp I was willing to part with. Unlike the seafood chains, the food is seasoned well here and not overly salted. The meals are very filling so there wasn't room for dessert but whatever dessert they were flaming by the bar looked really good.

I've been to many seafood restaurants around here as well as ocean front spots and this place is above average. From the apps to the sushi to the entrees....you can't go wrong with the fresh fish and creativity that's served up here."}
{"text":"This place really just is ok. The raw oysters were yummy and briny, everything you love about oysters but they couldn't tell me where they were from other than east coast and west coast...lol what? Anywho, I ordered the mussels in a white wine sauce with the garlic bread...ok am I the only one who wants to taste what I'm eating? Way too over seasoned with parmesan...like it got to be too much and I couldn't even finish it. Got key lime pie for dessert but it was just ok...no cocktails were ordered. Service was slow and it wasn't extremely busy either...staff just seems a bit out of it. The floors could use cleaning and the lighting is off...I would give it less than three stars if I didn't enjoy the raw oysters so much."}
{"text":"Food is between a 3 and 4 star depending on the dish.  We had lunch once and liked the openness to the street."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I'm in Pittsburgh I come to eat here and they never disappoint. The Skolar I the best! Kevin has taken care of us twice and he's the best!

Great food! Very casual ambiance! Definitely a must visit. I always recommend to everyone I speak to that I know is coming to the area!

I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I have no idea where to start with this visit . The waitress  seemed very confused and didnt mention specials  til we decided to order but hey whatever. Me and a guest started by ordering the lobster fries ( which were decent  )  then we ordered our entrees i had to tell the waitress i wanted my steak medium as she never asked and walked away. My guest got a chicken salad and I ordered the land and sea with the add on lobster tail.   A guy brought out our food and we never saw the waitress for a good 20 minutes so i was unable to inform her my steak came out well done ( tough and no pink at all )  so once the waitress does come over i inform her and she says i will take care of it .    About 10 minutes after me and my guest notice a man walking in from outside with clothing from a dry cleaners?  And he looks around then slowly walks to my table and says whats the matter?    Stunned as to who he is, i said my steak was cooked in connectly. He says he is sorry to hear and it will be taken care of and to please try them again he is the owners father , so i figured okay things will be fixed no problem.   So the manager/ chef who brought our food out comes over and says what seems to be the issue i explained the steak situation and was confused why i would pay $45 for a steak he says oh you didn't eat it?  ( must not be any communication)  so he says he will remove it, returns and only $25 was credited? At this point ive been done eating for nearly 40 minutes so i just pay for my bill and want to leave. As im walking outside the older gentleman approaches me and says was everything taken care of ( is there any communication is this place ? )   i explained not to my liking and he seems shocked and i tell him i eat out at many place quite a bit and he assures me he is sorry and to come back in and it will be all fixed this time because a life long customer is worth $22,000 .   I walk back in ( big mistake)  so the manager/ cook guy says what seems to be the problem, i explian my situation with the steak again and he says sir i cooked your steak it was cooked to 140degress and it was pink .   I question how it was pink if you didn't cut into it nor did you see the steak after i was served it? He said that my 3 pieces of shrimp and potatoes were worth the $20 that was not refunded and theres nothing else he can offer except dessert which he did offer initially. I decided to leave.

My question is who is this guy that approaches me at a restaurant he doesn't even work at and why did he try to help more then the staff?  I've read of atleast 1 of this exact experience with this guy...
Weird!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to a 5 for me because they tried so hard to make it a great experience for me, but some things just didn't fall into place.

To preface this, I was with a party of 10 for an engagement dinner party type of thing and decided on going to this restaurant because I hadn't tried it before and they were willing to accommodate for a large party on short notice.

The interior space has a good feel since its an open space with wide open seating and an extra cozier bar area upstairs which is where we were seated. That was a nice touch that they made it private but, the heat was turned up and it very hard to bear. We asked for them about it and they tried to turn the heat down and also bring a couple fans upstairs. They're going to need to look to fix this problem if they want to actually use this bar area in the winter.

We ordered 3 appetizers: Crab cakes, calamari and garlic sauteed shrimp they were all pretty standard and yummy but a big bonus was when Luke Wholey brought out a seared ahi tuna platter on the house that was delicious. We all had various entrees and sides but some highlights include the Lobster Bisque, the Maple Whiskey Glazed Shrimp/Scallops and the Blue Crab stuffed Salmon. Everything tasted delicious and would've been a meal worthy of a 5.

However there were some logistical issues that they need to figure out. After we ordered, we waited probably 30-40 min for all the food to come out. That wasn't that unreasonable since we had 10 people, but what wasn't so great was that they somehow dropped 2 orders so those came closer to 50 min and 2 of the orders weren't completely correct. They made up for it by comping both late entrees and after someone in the party let them know it was an engagement party we also had a champagne toast on the house.

All in all, I enjoyed the food very much and as a fan of seafood you should definitely come. I think this place will be a successful restaurant to come as it gets more experienced with dealing with different situations such as big groups."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure where to start on this review because everything was absolutely phenomenal. I could not have asked for a better server or better food which if you knew me says a lot considering my older brother is a professional chef who has won several championships in the state of Maryland and I've been a bit spoiled by his cooking. 
Let's get started. The date was Saturday February 18th - we brought some sunny beautiful 60-65 degree weather to Pittsburgh  My aunt made reservations for us since it would be a larger party at 6pm. 
It was my aunt and uncle, my favorite cousin's girlfriend and her mom, husband and I and our two kids. When we arrived, we were seated immediately. Our server Brian came over right away and got our drink order. He was fabulous! First off, our son is autistic and he was absolutely amazing with him. He could've very easily blown my son off while we were there and not answered 
our son's 50-60 questions about what type of cellphone do you have and why you should have an iPhone like his parents do. We all decided that we would share some appetizers. We ordered calamari, Thai chili catfish bites, wild Alaskan roll off of the sushi menu and I also got an order of seaweed salad for myself. 
My family all ordered the fish and chips, the crab stuffed salmon, the imperial swordfish, the Alaskan crab legs, my aunt ordered the Baja shrimp puttanesca pasta, the Baja shrimp and Day boat scallops, the colossal blue crab salad and it was absolutely amazing - all of it. Luke came out and checked on us. He was genuine, he talked to both of the kids, our daughter told him how her and our son caught a huge rockfish off the pier back home and showed him the picture(he thought it was awesome), Luke thanked us for coming in and told us to call him at the restaurant next time we were in town. 
I know this is long, my insincere apologies lol but this place is so worth it! So if y'all have"}
{"text":"Any, and possibly the only, appeal of this place (read: lobster bisque fries) has been ruined by the fact that drunk uncle Wholey now sits outside with a lobster megaphone making rude comments about the people, namely women, that walk by.  Bad, slow service to boot.  Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars because of the delicious oysters we had last night (Tuesday's are still half price so you get 12/$15).  

I really, really want to like this place...  I love the concept, I love the fact that the original & still flourishing Wholeys is right down the street, I LOVE the fact that on every occasion that we have been there- Luke was greeting guests...  BUT their service (at least the regular bartender service) is quite slow and very inattentive.  There are about 20 seats at the bar and there were maybe 6 people sitting there when we sat down.  It took the 'cooler' of the 2 bartenders over 5 minutes to step over to ask us, \"You wanna see menu's...?\"  Like, how about \"Can I get you guys a drink while you check out the menu...?\"  After-all, we WERE sitting at the bar.  We sat down at 6:30 and happy hour was going on till 7.  We were handed menu's and he walked away.  We weren't told of the HH specials until we asked the 'friendlier' bartender.  The oysters aren't even listed on the menu- I could understand if they were listed w/o pricing or with a caveat that said \"These are some of the types we offer, depending on the season and the fisherman's 'haul...\"  

The service finally improved when the 'bar manager' stepped behind the bar and started serving the full bar.  I don't know what the other 2 guys did while he was serving but they almost blended into the background.  The manager was very friendly & knowledgeable, making suggestions when people asked about beers & wines...  I just don't know if those other 2 were pulled from being servers and told they had to tend bar for the night or what, but they just seemed like they were uninterested in being there... 

As for the oysters- we had originally ordered the Blue Points but after waiting about a half hour- the bartender came over to tell us that they were out of Blue Points and he suggested we substitute the St. James River oysters.  They arrived about 5 minutes later- complete with a cocktail sauce & horseradish.  They were delicious...!  

The owners- Mr Robert Wholey is about the friendliest guy you're going to meet.  He stopped to talk, told us a little about the restaurant, invited us up to see his art gallery (which we declined ONLY because we were afraid we'd lose our seats at the bar).  He stopped at every table- he would be a favorite of Jon Taffer's (from Bar Rescue).  And his son- Luke... he's also as friendly as his dad and he stopped to talk about the restaurant, his favorite muskie fishing baits & areas, etc.  These guys are a class act and that's why I love this place..."}
{"text":"Great seafood. Friendly bartenders. My gf and I ordered oysters and sushi and it was all fresh and tasty. I will recommend this place to any seafood lovers."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here. Awesome house music venue on Saturday nights!!! Plenty of room to dance; garage doors up in good weather! There is an amazing Danceteria-vibe here!!!!! This is good live DJ music folks!!!!!"}
{"text":"All you seafood lovers in Pittsburgh... Luke Wholey's is where it's at!!! After years of going to the strip district & eating at Roland's my boyfriend and I decided to check out Luke Wholey's for lunch instead a few years ago and were pleasantly surprised. Ever since then, I keep on coming back! 

The atmosphere at Luke Wholey's looks like something that would be at the beach! It is the perfect fun seafood ambiance. In the Summer, they open the doors to sit outside on the sidewalk as well- which I love! I've also never had bad service while eating at Wholey's. I've been here on dates with my boyfriend, nights out with my girlfriends, and even brunch on Sunday with my parents and have always enjoyed myself! 

Just about all of the food at Wholey's is fabulous. Some of my favorites include the lobster bisque fries (yes, a mound of French fries drizzled with lobster bisque), salmon, sushi, and ahi tuna. On my last visit, I tried the sushi for the first time after my friend raved about how amazing their sushi was. The waiter suggested the rainbow roll, so I gave that a try. It was super fresh and delicious. I also ordered a cup of the lobster bisque and a side Caesar salad. The lobster bisque is a little too rich for my liking- I prefer it over French fries more. I also love all of their specialty cocktails! I am not a bloody mary fan, but my boyfriend & dad love them from here! Luke Wholey's will always be a favorite spot in Pittsburgh for me."}
{"text":"Seafood was really nice, flavourful and fresh. Service was good, ambience is relaxing"}
{"text":"I think the food here is great. Service is fun and friendly. The muscles and the divine marina sauce they come in are my absolute favorite in the city. Anytime I've encountered the owner during a visit he as well is super friendly and outgoing !!! This is definitely our go to place for muscles and I'm guessing we make it there at least three times a month."}
{"text":"I planned to have a birthday dinner at the restaurant as it came highly recommended. I was looking forward to the delicious food that I heard so much about. We started with amazing appetizers and a great server named Davin (sorry if it's spelled wrong). I ordered the calamari and a drink named Paloma. Others at the table got mozzarella sticks, crab cakes, and lobster bisque fries. They were all delicious. Then the Baja shrimp volcano came recommended by the manager named Ryan.  The food lived up to it's hype. We all enjoyed our food. Since it was my birthday I received a complimentary cheesecake. It was delicious. I thank you to the workers who did a phenomenal job caring for me and my friends.

*Reason for 3 stars*

Upon leaving the establishment we were greeted by Mr. Robert Wholey. There were racial comments said that made me and my company feel very uncomfortable.  It's a shame good food went to waste. I will not recommend anyone to go here if these are the ideals that are upheld."}
{"text":"Service has been aces every visit. Pom mimosa's with veggie sushi is every vegans dream."}
{"text":"Well, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect for Luke Wholey's.  From the second it was announced, I thought I'd be hooked.  All I could think about were delicious big  fish sandwiches, sushi inspired by Tommy (note, if you've never had Tommy's sushi from Wholey's Market...  you're missing out), and lobster bisque smothered on everything.

A quick glance at the menu made me think my dreams had come true...  but then the Groupon was announced.   Knowing my luck with group-deal joins has been about a 40-60 success rate, I had my concerns.  Nevertheless, I purchased the deal, and to much delight, I heard multiple good reviews from fellow Yelpers in the interim.

Getting to the point...  what a letdown.  The lobster bisque fries were downright bland.  Poorly fried potatoes literally swimming in bisque and garlic  butter lead to something that couldn't find an identity between smothered fries, chowder, and the remains of a beaver damn after a really bad flood.

My swordfish, while massive, was overcooked to the point of serving better as a rubber mallet (bland tasting to boot).  The fiance's seafood pasta, while swimming with what seemed to be a high quality orgy of sea creatures, lacked much flavor and desperately needed salt and other seasoning (which we had to get up and ask a bus boy for along with silverware as our server was nowhere to be found...  another story).

The only reason for the 3 star review, is that the blue point oysters we sampled were hands down the best I've had in the burgh.  Couple this with a decent side for the swordfish of potatoes, cabbage, and bacon, and overall, I felt like we at least at a meal at the quality of what we paid for the Groupon.

Will be venturing back for brunch (one more deal to go), so I'll provide an update after that endeavor."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give it negative stars!  Treated so terribly by the staff that we left without ordering!  Took our hard earned cash down the street to Bella Notte where they treated us wonderfully!!!!  I will NEVER eat at Luke Wholey!!"}
{"text":"Really I'd give it a 3.5 -Came for brunch on a Sunday - wow was it packed - only had to wait 15 min to get seated but when you're hungry it seems like a lifetime.  Of course I had to get the Bloody Mary (it was Sunday after all) I just added the candied bacon - next time I'm going for it and adding the shrimp and soft shell crab!  I ordered the shrimp po boy - wasn't what I expected but it was pretty tasty - not knock my socks off good but tasty just the same and I don't know if I was just starving but the French fries were delicious. Hubby's blackened catfish Sammy, on the other hand, was awesome.  Super tasty and huge!  Probably would come here again but it is a little pricey."}
{"text":"It is really pricey here and for the amount that they charge the food taste just OK so I was not overly blown away"}
{"text":"The service was great and everyone was super friendly but the food was not good at all. We got lunch entrees which were the sweet soy ahi tuna on a bed of wild rice & book choy, 2 orders of lobster bisque fries, 2 bloody Mary's, & 1 bourbon on the rocks and our bill was $70!! The tuna had no flavor, you couldn't even cut the bok choy with a knife it was so hard, and the rice was not good either. The fries were just okay. The only good thing about the meal was the shrimp on the Bloody Mary. It was totally no where near worth $70 plus a tip. I would give 5 stars for service and 1 for the food and the price. Go down the street to Wholey's, get fresh seafood and make it yourself...even if you've never cooked a meal in your life, I'm sure it would taste better!! So disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"There were 16 of us for dinner, everyone enjoyed their meals!  The appetizers were awesome, the lobster fries, fried oysters and lobster pizza.  I had the imperial swordfish and it was great.  I can't wait to go back.  We were in the private room at the top of the stairs, great service and ambience."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch at Luke Wholey's over the weekend.  He sampled the lobster bisque  fries as a meal.  I asked him to have the bisque on the side since we usually share and I love the bisque by itself.  I also thought it would be great dipping sauce but I like to decide how much I want on things.  Wow I am glad I did.  The big cup of bisque was great for dipping and the cheesy garlic fries were crispy and good. Lots of Lobster pieces strewn throughout.  I also had the trio with nice scallop and shrimp and piece of fish.  Everything fresh and good.  The infused vodkas are a real draw with bartender Joby coming up with some great concoctions to tempt you to have one more.  Luke was ever present with his great smile and welcoming attitude.   Luke, Jason, Matthew and Joby all make the experience a fun one you want to repeat!"}
{"text":"The best bloody Mary's in Pittsburgh. First time back in the strip district and this place is a must find and dine! Friendly staff and great drinks!"}
{"text":"The lobster roll here is really great. I've only been here once because I can never make it to the strip district during normal hours but I would definitely come back again. The service was particularly okay and the Bloody Mary was pretty good too! You can never go wrong with seafood and theirs is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Luke Wholey's for a while and tonight was finally able to do so. We will be back for sure. Super good. It was a slow night (but also a Pens game- so that worked to our benefit) started with the Shrimp Cocktail and Calamari. Large Shrimp that were very good (just not chilled cold) but that's really my only complaint on the whole meal. Shrimp cocktail, to me, should be very cold. These were room temperature. I had the Shrimp Volcano. Mashed potatoes topped with Lobster bisque and shrimp. Very nice. The asparagus was perfect. My husband had the crab topped salmon and said it was delicious.  We shared the flourless chocolate torte and added a scoop of ice cream. Would recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in Pittsburgh on our way to West Virginia and was craving sushi so we found this cute little spot and I have to say I'm so glad we did. The decor was ocean themed and the staff were very attentive and friendly. We ordered a sushi roll and in addition got the Mahi Mahi fish tacos and they were AMAZING. Would love to come back someday."}
{"text":"Wholey's makes me happy. The store, that is.  Surround me in fresh seafood and I'm like a fish IN water. So, when Luke opened up his own place, I couldn't wait to try it someday! Today was that day. Mumsie picked me up from work for a mid-week treat at Luke's and we were not disappointed. I enjoyed the lunch entrée version of [Blackened] Shrimp & Scallops on a house salad (option for jasmine rice and vegetables and sweet soy instead of blackened), while she had the Seared Ahi Tuna, also on a house salad. The salads themselves were delicious, if a bit small, and the Blackened flavor was strong, but savory.  We opted to sit in the \"window\" of the garage door opening - a poor choice for an August day that ended up topping out at 65  instead of the usually 80+!  But we still had a delightful time and I'll be returning again soon.  Bring on the Bass!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on a Friday night, and we're not impressed. It wasn't busy, but the service was quite bad. We went the sushi route, and regretted it.  The eel nigiri was dry, and the seaweed wrapper was simply laid on top, as opposed to actually wrapping it.  We also got an eel roll with avocado and cucumber.  There was no avocado in it at all, and it was very loosely rolled, so it fell apart as we ate it. 

Nothing was horrible, but we were quite disappointed. If you've got the Wholey name in Pittsburgh, we are going to expect good seafood. Luke Wholey was an embarrassment to the name, at least as the sushi goes."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying they seem to try really hard to please their customers and some of the dishes were excellent. That said, the 3 star rating is because some weren't excellent and the ambience was challenged on this particular evening because the restaurant was extremely cold. The calamari appetizer was mediocre. The lobster roll would have been excellent if it could be handled. The bun was hard and could not fold to envelop the lobster. That made it open-faced. The crab-stuffed salmon was very good. In the shrimp scampi with linguine, the shrimp were very tasty, but the whole dish seemed a bit heavy. Interesting atmosphere and, with a few more patrons, could have a nice energy. We'd try it again, but the second time has to be a charm."}
{"text":"Me and a few friends just stopped in briefly to indulge on some oysters and have a bloody mary in an attempt to sure  a hangover. Our bartender Brett made some tasty bloody's. He said the mix is made from scratch in house, love that. They had a pickle in them and two giant head-on cocktail shrimp, and a lemon, lime, and olive. He was funny and we had a good time chatting with him. Me and my friend D walked to the front with me to see what the oysters of the day were, they're half off on Tuesdays!!!!! Two servers came over and told us about the different options and suggested their favorites. We had the St.Simon and I think the other might have been called wildcats? They were cleaned good and shucked right. When we left, my other friend left his phone and charger there. Brett found me on facebook within 5 minutes of us leaving and let me know he had it! way cool!"}
{"text":"Amazing bloody Mary's- which I was craving-, great calamari, too. It tasted so fresh and our waitress (forget her name) was prompt and pleasant. We didn't wait for a table at all and we did not feel rushed once we decided all we wanted to do was enjoy a few drinks. The only reasons for 4 stars is because we were sitting at an extremely low table. My husband is 5 foot 11 and this was certainly not comfortable for him, I'm sure. The other reason is because it seemed a little pricey, however I didn't mind paying for seafood that tasted this delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love this place!!  I did a yelp (yelped?) and the reviews were pointing us here, so I grabbed my co-worker and off we went.  Parking was easy, finding a spot on the street after 6pm (went on a Tuesday).  

Upon entering, we were told we could choose our table, so we went bar-side, near the sushi station.  We were quickly greeted by a waiter who took our drink order while giving us the daily special rundown.  Very pleasant interaction.  Another waitress delivered our drinks and explained they'd both be taking care of us tonight...both were just spot on, attentive and very fun.

I'll get to the good stuff---- the food is amazing.  I opted for the dozen steamed shrimp as an app...being from Baltimore originally, these were perfect.  Great flavor and pretty large.  My coworker opted for calimari...was lightly battered and tasty.  For the entree, I opted for the mexican volcano and kinda licked my plate (don't judge me).  The shrimp were huge, had a nice little (very little) char to them and went so well with the lobster bisque and taters.  And the asparagus was so good too.  Just a great meal.  She went with a couple of sushi rolls and raved about the freshness, quality and flavor.  We did not leave room for dessert, which I was bummed about.

Run to this place...great service, very clean decor and a really fun atmosphere.  Top notch all the way around."}
{"text":"I had the Steel City Lobster Roll, and it was ok. The fries were soggy and their weren't any vegetables really in it, so there was no crunch. I could only taste the lobster and the bisque, which was pretty bland. Also, my girlfriend has Celiac, so don't go there if you can't have gluten, because they leech the flavor out of everything. The service was amazing though and the Bloody Mary was one of the best in the city according to my girlfriend."}
{"text":"Interesting place to eat, with murals adorning the walls. We ordered some sushi and sashimi in hopes of a quick dinner (we were wrong). The fish was fresh and the tuna was melt in your mouth good. The sushi (double double roll and kitchen sink) itself was good, but not outstanding and was just missing that extra something. I asked for some spicy sauce and that helped. The service was s-l-o-w for some unknown reason."}
{"text":"The BEST place in The Strip District!!! The most amazing bartender & event planner, Jay, made our night! His fun personality is the reason we will return!  The atmosphere is great, the food looked and smelled great, although I only had a shrimp cocktail at the bar. The shrimp was huge and so fresh!  Huge bar and lots of starting with some open to the sidewalk. Definitely recommend this place if you are going to the Burgh!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town and glad I found this place. It's located on the strip. It's good and fresh!! The lobster bisque is the best I have ever had. It has chunks of lobster and melts in your mouth. The ahi tuna is FedEx fresh everyday from Honolulu. 
The atmosphere is neighborhood bar with all ages. The bartender Jamie was amazing and very attentive. She helped me pick a local brewed beer and recommended the ahi tuna plate which couldn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"I love their bloody Mary's. I have not had their food but I've had quality interactions with their bartenders. They are great, very personable and caring for a first time interaction. They are probably the best bloody Mary's I've had in Pittsburgh. 
I tried to bring my family there during a busy time. We would have totally understood a busy situation. We were looking to get drinks. It didn't matter where we were, we just wanted drinks and we made it clear to the hostess that we only wanted drinks but we were willing to wait. She told us that there wasn't any availability, we waited to see if she had any other situations. She did not. She didn't look at us like it was our cue to leave.
In my opinion, I thought she was an idiot. 
It irritated me that she handled a \"hard to handle\" situation the way that she did."}
{"text":"Valentines day is supposed to be a pleasent memory. This one was not, courtesy of Luke Wholeys.
   After arriving early for a reservation, we placed an order at the bar for old bay peel and eat shrimp. 5 mins after placing that order we were ushered to our table. The bar staff assured me that the shrimp would be sent to the tableside. It took them another 45 mins to present half a dozen peel and eat shrimp and no old bay seasoning. Cocktail sauce tasted more of horseradish rather than a traditional sauce.
  Lobster bisque fries: arrived 20 mins ahead of the peel and eat shrimp and
 whilst visually appealing, it left much to be desired. Lobster meat was rubbery and overcooked, almost artificial in taste. Fries were limp and soaked in grease as well as the bisque. Bisque had an overpowering sherry taste to it. Almost drowning any other flavor profile.

  Main course, had hoped that it would have rebounded the already dismal experience so far, but was as inadequate as the rest of the meal. Baja blackened shrimp and scallops with a jasmine rice bed and four grilled asparagus. Rice was covered in a sweet balsamic reduction that tasted more soy sauce then balsamic vinegar reduction. Shrimp and scallops were overcooked and had the feel of rubber bouncing balls. 
     It will be a very long time before i ever decide to return, if at all"}
{"text":"I understand that seafood is expensive but man I just can't justify going here.  And I'll shell out for good food.

The food is ok, but not the wow experience that I've come to expect from the Pittsburgh food scene."}
{"text":"We stopped for our Friday night Lenten dinner... I loved the Lobster Bisque Fries, Sushi and Calamari... but the Broiled Cod and Lump Crab entree was terrific!! I also had a chance to try the Wasabi Swordfish which is Delishious!
 I was pleasantly surprised that when we arrived for a 6:30 dinner time there were a number of tables available!!
 
Very good food!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. A bit pricy but well worth it for the quality, freshness, etc. you get. I highly recommend this place. If you stop by ask for Kevin. He provided some of the best service I'be ever had."}
{"text":"I have loved Luke's since the first time I set foot in the door back in 2013 [yea I was late to the game] so I am excited to finally review the place.

For all Pittsburghers the name Wholey is automatically associated with high quality Seafood, so Luke had some big shoes to fill when he opened it back in 2012. Nestled on the corner of 21st street the first thing that you come across is an inviting outdoor patio with a few tables and an outdoor oyster bar. Pick your favorites fresh on ice. The outdoor seating is actually a walk in by opening the garage style door so it's easy to walk inside and out without having to go around the ropes from Penn Avenue. Definitely give this a try on a cool summer evening in August and sunny Saturday's during Spring and Fall. Oh and did I mention they have a DJ on 

When you walk in the door the first thing that you noticed is the decor. Every wall is filled with Mural [My favorite is Cali's clown fish - painted by a local artist] off Fish or decorated with over-sized swordfish replica. The back wall behind the pillar has a mid-sized aquarium with live fish. [There were rumors on having a shark in there once]. The main room has round table seating with tables made of giant spools similar to the ones you can find on a boat. Off to the right side of the restaurant is a large bar where one of their excellent bartenders will make you anything your heart desires, whether a regular vodka soda, to super strong long island iced teas or warming hot toddies [I had a terrible cold and no voice the first time I came here - instant love]. Usually I get a standard Pinot Grigio [I am so common] 

Making your way to the back the upstairs divides itself into a private lounge and a Loft lounge. The upstairs will have Hightops and you can peer over the balcony over the rest of the restaurant. The private lounge is perfect for any company dinner all you have to do is watch out for the stuffed brown bear.

Now to the actual point -- the Food!
Because I am an appetizer junky we shall start there: You cannot go wrong with the Lobster Bisque. It is thick and buttery with a generous helping of actual lobster rather than just the flavor or the shreds I have gotten in many Bisques elsewhere. This bisque has spoiled me by far - my favorite ever. The coloring is on the darker brown end to me that just means heartiness. Btw - you can get this at the Wholey's grocery store as well and you will not be disappointed. Luke's serves this in a Yinzer version - which means there are Lobster bisque fries. [that's a little much for me].

The catfish bites are delectable, light and fluffy. Little breading and a chili sauce to dunk it in, same thing with the calamari [just basil marinara rather than chili]. Speaking of some spice - I recently shared the mussels and they are just the treat. Beware of the portion though, this could definitely be a meal just for yourself, so get this when you are sharing. I personally do not like Oysters so I take this from a friend's review: You get a lot of them as a variety from both Atlantic and Pacific. In the summer they even serve them over ice outside. [naturally when the sun isn't shining directly on them]

For entrees the same goes as the appetizers. Large portions of delicious on delicious. Because of my stuffing with apps, my boy and I shared the Fish and Chips Platter with Scallops and Jumbo Shrimp. No disappointment here, the breading was light, the portion generous and the scallops so soft. you can never go wrong with Wholey's scallops, whether eating out or at home dinner party as Wine and Cheese share-ables. While we did not have it the crab stuff salmon walked by our table and smelled amazing. I can't wait to go back and try it.

As Luke has fish in his blood you will get daily specials on a regular basis, when he has awesome catches they usually end right on the menu as a taco or lightly fried up bites. If you see him, he will gush you into trying everything.

Other things to mention: Have an event here! I personally have hosted 3 of them now [2 for my CMU MBAs and 1 for the Pittsburgh Happy Hour Annual Party] and Jason the Manager is so helpful and easy to deal with. I continue to overwhelm him with an eating bunch and despite running our waiters ragged, everybody was beyond pleased. Be sure to be considerate for both the holiday season and the Wholey's Annual party in the Summer so plan ahead. The staff is more than helpful.

Make sure to ask about the rewards points. Yup - a restaurant with rewards points. Every $200 you get $20 credited so you can come back and enjoy again. Oh - make sure to register it so you protect your balance. I recently lost mine [upset!] so don't do what I did. 

Love this place and need to rush back soon to try again."}
{"text":"Fab-u-lous!  Seriously, from the appetizers to the chocolate covered strawberries that we were given for dessert on Valentine's day - free - it was spectacular.  

My husband and I arrived around 530 on Valentine's day without reservations.  We had bought a half off deal on WPXI and were hoping to use it on Valentine's day, not thinking about reservations.  Sadly, they weren't needed as the place was only about half full by the time we left.  It should have been packed as this is one of the great seafood restaurants in town!

I gasped as I saw that they had oyster shooters.  While living in NYC, this was a staple of any good brunch, but after living here for 7 years, they are hard to find.  I immediately ordered one, but was a bit disappointed by the bloody mary mix.  It tasted more like marinara than bloody mary, but the oyster - oh, the oyster!  So delicious, I ordered two more oysters.  Sadly, they had run out of the type I wanted, so in a purely classy move, they gave me two others and then offered me two others to try.  Woo hoo for oysters!

For the main course, we decided to split two meals.  I ordered the seafood lovers pasta and J ordered the sockeye salmon stuffed with lump crab with smashed potatoes, red potatoes (he likes his starch) and asparagus.  OMG.  When the pasta came out, I was astounded by the amount of seafood in it - clams, mussels, gigantic shrimp, massive pieces of lobster claw meat, calamari, salmon.... I think that was it.  Oh, scallops!  Damn.  Awesome, awesome quality fish in a mildly spicy basil marinara.  It's refreshing to see seafood in a non-cream sauce and this was absolutely delicious.  J's salmon was cooked perfectly with heaps of lump crab meat.  The potatoes were all fantastic and while the asparagus was good, there were only like 6 thin sad little spears.  For $3.50 for chargrilled asparagus, I would like a bigger pile than the sad little spears we received.  They were really good though.  

We decided to pass on dessert - they only had cheesecake.  However, when they brought the bill they also brought two of the most spectacular chocolate covered strawberries with a nice heaping of whipped cream.  

We will definitely be back.  There are literally 10 other things on the menu that I wanted to try and their sandwiches sound delicious. 

A great new find in the strip!"}
{"text":"Don't you dare to go to this place!!! Don't get tricked by the reviews! It's super hip and the food is just okay, doesn't taste fresh at all!!! The service is even worst!!!"}
{"text":"Apparently, we committed a cardinal sin by coming to the door without a reservation on a Saturday night. The maître d' told us to leave (jokingly) then said he'd find us a table despite our lack of reservation. 

30 minutes later, after repeatedly being asked if we had a reservation as though we had not just had the exact same conversation, we were seated at a table that had been empty the entire time.

The maître d' then proceeded to do everything but read the menu to us item by item. This ended up being beyond uncomfortable due to his total lack of respect for personal space and the overwhelming odor of his pomade.  I thought perhaps this all was a fluke, but I watched the same thing happen 4 times over the course of our meal.

House mismanagement continued as there was apparent confusion  over who was to be our server. Once they decided amongst themselves, we waited a further 10 minutes to place our drink order which took a further 10 minutes to deliver. By this time we had been at the restaurant for almost an hour and only then did we order our food. Going by the heavily pomaded gentleman's recommendation, I ordered from the \"best sushi menu in Pittsburgh.\" only to be told that only the items with asterisks next to them were actually available. After another round of deliberation and waiting we finally got our food order in. 

The peel and eat shrimp and oyster platter was fine. Of the 3 different kinds of oysters provided, only one had a lovely clean fresh taste. The peel and eat shrimp was fantastic. 

My sushi came out and contained cream cheese. I sent it back as the wrong order because the salmon roll I ordered from the menu didn't say it came with creme cheese. I got the same order back and was told that the salmon roll comes with creme cheese and who doesn't like creme cheese and salmon? By this point, I would have eaten my own arm so I accepted the dish which was mediocre at best. The rice was extremely sweet and the fish was firm, but rather tasteless. 

When our main course came out-- fish and chips-- we requested the usual condiments-- vinegar and ketchup and salt, since everything  on the plate seemed as though it was unsalted. 15 minutes later, after watching our waiter pass by and deliver drinks and condiments to no fewer than 3 other tables and bar back fro a bit, I pulled a bus boy aside and requested the condiments again. He brought them back in a matter of moments. 

Our waiter then returned to see how we were doing and I told him that his bus boy had delivered what we requested. He hovered around the table apologizing for a minute or two before faffing off and not returning with our requested check for another, I kid you not, half an hour. 

If the quality of the fish and shrimp were not so good and well cooked, I would be giving this restaurant one star and i definitely wont' be returning."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch. Lobster bisque is the best in the city. My lunch was a lobster roll steel city style. My wife enjoyed crabcakes salad. You can't beat this place if you like fresh seafood."}
{"text":"We had an awesome lunch here today. We had the Lobster Bisque Fries and a Bloody Mary (reported to be a couple of their specialties) and they were both extremely good. We also had the lunch special Sockeye salmon (my husband had it blackened and I had the sweet soy) and we both loved it. The salmon was cooked to perfection. Our server, Brett, was super nice and personable and we had a great time! We will definitely be going back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"You gotta have a bloody mary! 
The best!
I had the crab sandwich & fries.
Best crab cake ever. Didn't even need the bun!"}
{"text":"Long wait for drinks from the bar. Absolutely rude man at the door. Giving 3 stars because the tuna and eggs was delicious as well as the catfish bites. Our server (blonde girl. Can't remember her name) was a doll too!

We will be back, but hope for a little more hospitality next time."}
{"text":"I visited Luke Wholey's earlier tonight for dinner with my parents.  I'd been wanting to try it for a long while now, so given that they're fans of good seafood and that I had a City Dining Card for it, this gave me the push necessary to try it.

We started out by ordering the lobster bisque fries ($11), given that it was one of the more unique menu items and that many other Yelpers recommended them.  They consisted of fries over lobster bisque with chunks of lobster topped with scallions, and were the highlight of the meal.  If you like poutine, you'll enjoy them, for sure.  Because I wanted to try the lobster bisque by itself, I decided to order a cup of it with my meal ($7).  This turned out to be a mistake, given that it was too salty and rich for my taste, and that I felt that it was overpriced (for a cup).  If you're considering stopping here for lunch, bear in mind that you can get 4-5 times the amount of crab-lobster bisque of comparable quality across the street (with more seafood, no less!) in a quick serve setting at Wholey's Fish Market for less $.

For our entrees, my mom ordered the crab cake salad ($15.95), my dad ordered the baja shrimp volcano ($28), and I ordered the crab stuffed salmon ($30).  While my salmon was well cooked and tasty with the sauce, it didn't blow my mind the way I expect for an entree at this price point.  Also, the bok choy served with my entree seemed a bit limp when served, and there was a piece of skin underneath my salmon.  While these may seem like minor details, I have a higher standard for fine dining-esque than for mid-range restaurants, so I can't let them slide.  I tried a piece of my mom's crabcake and some of the potatoes from my dad's volcano, and again, they seemed tasty, but not mind-blowing.  They both seemed satisfied enough--though they're not as exacting as I am when it comes to eating out.

On the a positive note, our service was very good, so I have no complaints there.  The atmosphere is more casual than I was expecting, which fits with the atmosphere of the Strip District, but not with the fine dining-esque nature of the restaurant.  I concur with another reviewer that I'd be willing to give this place another shot for lunch (or happy hour), I don't think I'd be willing to pay dinner prices again.  Since my opinion is hovering between 3 and 4 stars, I'm splitting the difference and going with 3.5."}
{"text":"I went back this year to try their crab delights during their special crab fest. They were mostly soft shell crabs.

The hostess stated everything was reserved but I could sit at the bar. So sat at the fish tank bar and watched their fishes.

I ordered the delicious Lobster bisque fries with lobster meat and their yummy soft shell crab tacos and watched their fish in the tank since my service was a little slow..... 

This is probably the best seafood place in da burgh."}
{"text":"An okay, no-frills spot for lunch in the Strip District.

Expect good seafood but not too much in the way of service. Servers do not care."}
{"text":"The Lobster Bisq was incredible!!!  VERY friendly staff, made you feel at home, truly!!"}
{"text":"5 Stars for the Bloody Mary and the oysters. I can not add anything further because that is all I have tried. Guess oysters are oysters but Bloody Mary takes skill and the ones here are as good as I have had anywhere in the USA."}
{"text":"Great food! Not crazy expensive. Interesting meals as well.
Cat fish bites with the Thai dip was my favourite.
Would definitely recommend this place for dinner.
Great service too."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Luke Wholey's on a Saturday evening for dinner. We got the lobster fries and calamari as an appetizer. Both were delicious. We devoured the entire portion of fries in minutes. It was smothered in cheeses and lumps of lobster. SO GOOD! The calamari was also very satisfying. It was breaded and fried to perfection and the portion was a reasonable size. But did I mention the lobster fries? For real, those were heaven on Earth.

For dinner, I got the crab stuffed salmon. It was served with a side of fried potatoes. The sauce on the salmon was so flavorful. It had a hint of a maple syrup taste to it and I found myself dipping the potatoes in it too. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the crab stuffing was so good, I could have eaten a bowl of it on its own. 

My husband got sushi, which he told me was good, but not the best he's ever had. It got the job done in satisfying his sushi tooth. 

On top of the great food, the environment in Luke Wholey's also added to the positive experience. The second floor/loft space was a little warm because the air conditioning doesn't make it up there, but it wasn't too bad considering it was a 90 degree day. They really did a great job at creating a beachy/waterfront type restaurant where I felt like I was on vacation in Florida rather than sitting in the Strip District. I'm not sure if that's what they were going for though considering it's Luke Wholey's Wild ALASKAN Grille. Either way, it was nice to feel like I was on vacation even though it was just another Saturday night in the burgh. 

Bottom line: Amazing food, great environment. I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I love their oyster selection! If you're coming to the strip district; keep going past Roland's and eat at Luke Wholey's. The oysters are so fresh and so so so good. They have great drinks, really nice bartenders and super fresh seafood. Everyone is friendly and they provide a personalized experience. Oysters are expensive but you are paying for quality. They aren't orange and fishy like Roland's. They are huge!!! I normally come here just for the oysters. Also have a Bloody Mary, they are so creative with the flavors and the appearance."}
{"text":"Although I vowed to never use the word, I have to call Luke Wholey's funky. It's an old beach restaurant in the middle of the city. The menu is all seafood, the dining room is high and loud and painted with murals and not overly clean, and the customers span the whole range of humanity, excluding the elite. It's unique and great, if that's what you're looking for. The food was good and includes some unusual twists on traditional seafood dishes. We had lobster bisque, fish tacos, and lobster mac and cheese. Everything was good. The wine list is very limited but did contain a nice California Chardonnay at a reasonable price. The server took good care of us but didn't seem to enjoy it very much. We'll return when we're ready for another beach experience."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because everyone was saying it is the best seafood in Pittsburgh. The food was not what I expected. I ordered the swordfish and it was very fishy tasting with a mushy consistency.  My boyfriend had scallops and shrimp which seemed to be over cooked and small. We did have the lobster Mac and cheese which was pretty delicious compared to the rest of the food. The restaurant was very busy and the waiter told us that the kitchen was getting slammed. It could have been a bad night to try this place but I doubt I will try it again. It was very overpriced for the quality of food. There are too many fabulous restaurants in Pittsburgh to visit instead."}
{"text":"Really solid seafood spot. I got the halibut entree and ahi tuna appetizer, both of which were very good, and my wife's crab legs were super fresh. She also got the crab cakes as an appetizer, which we really liked as well. My mom also came and got the crab-stuffed salmon, which I didn't like quite as much as the others, but wasn't bad.

Prices are a little bit high for Pittsburgh, but not terrible for seafood more generally."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great spot to dine while in the Strip District, this place is awesome.  I got the Steel City Lobster Roll and it doesn't disappoint! The lobster is perfectly cooked and they smother it with lobster bisque. Also- ask for the Bloody Mary menu.  Best Bloody Mary I have had for a while- made with their homemade mix and you can add a fried soft shell crab or candied bacon.  Service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"A very inviting space, Luke's was disappointing to me on food.  I ordered the seared ahi tuna appetizer, props to this being mostly discounted due to the yelp checkin but the tuna was overcooked and personally I think the dish would be much better leaving the tuna raw because the flavor of the slaw and sauce was a good compliment.

My crab cake sandwich was small and I was disappointed that they would not broil the crab cake but the waiter assured me that it was only quickly flash fried. We might have differing definitions of flash fried because there was a thick layer of fried crust which deterred what would have otherwise been a good sammy. The fries were excellent - well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The bloody marys (although I didn't order one) had epicly sized accoutrements."}
{"text":"I went to Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille a couple Friday nights ago.

First of all the atmosphere was great. I loved the lighting, earth tone colors and the large projection screen to watch a Pens game (or Steeler or Pirates for that matter). 

Food was amazing. I ordered the crab stuffed salmon with red mashed potatoes and my date had fresh seared scallops and shrimp and mashed potatoes. 

Last but not least, the staff was wonderful. Except for a tiny mix up when paying my bill the wait staff was friendly and even comedic at times.

I listed them on my blog with a little more info as well if anyone is interested in checking it out at http://midnightguru.com/place.php?id=112"}
{"text":"Decent seafood. Went here on St. Patrick's day with 5 other people, and we all had a pretty good meal. Nothing worth the hype that I'd heard about Wholey's from lifetime fans. I guess I appreciate that it's a local staple, and the seafood is as good as some of the better places in Pittsburgh. Still not as good as most coastal seafood places I've been in Baltimore, Boston, New York, California, etc. I will say this - Luke Wholey did come say hi to us and asked how our meal was. That was a really sweet touch that did win me over a bit. The prices are a bit steep, but I guess you get the seafood you pay for. I'm still a Penn Ave Fish Company supporter! I might be back for lunch, but I probably wouldn't pay dinner prices again."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  Somewhat over-priced and the food was just alright.  I wrote a blog post about it: http://crayonsanddrywall.com/2014/07/30/the-weekend-luke-wholeys-wild-alaskan-grille/"}
{"text":"Food was amazing....service was awful.  The waiter was by far the most ride waiter I have encountered."}
{"text":"A little expensive for a casual place at first impression. But It's probably because of the seafood quality. The food was very well prepared. My friend Giuseppe ordered lobster mac and cheese I volunteered to help him with.  Surf and turf entrees abound."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town to see the NatsPirates games.  This was our first visit to Pittsburgh.  We stopped at Luke Wholey's for a drink during Happy Hour and ended up eating there.  We ordered 3 Small Plates from the Happy Hour menu.  The plates were generous and delicious.  Jayme, the Bar Manager, was very pleasant and gave us good recommendations.  Will definitely go back, even if the Nats aren't in town."}
{"text":"I decided to have my retirement party at Luke's and it turned out great!  There were 40 family, friends and co-workers upstairs in the mezzanine. I was worried it would be too crowded, but I think the small intimate space encouraged more mingling among the diverse group.

The appetizers were delicious - everyone commented about how good they were.  Jason and Luke did a great job helping me decide on the menu - peel to eat shrimp, chicken skewers, beef sliders, salad and scrumptious crab dip with homemade chips.

The servers, David and Angie, were efficient, quick and polite - again, got many compliments from the group about their service.

The only slight negative was the warm temp upstairs.  I realize it is very difficult to control the temp in that type of building, and they did a good job of cooling it down - my 88 year old mother loved it!

I've been to Luke Wholey's for dinner, drinks, lunch and now the party.  I plan to be back soon!"}
{"text":"I like Luke Wholey's and my service was excellent, but I can see where you could have a \"totally worth it\" or a \"totally not worth it\" experience based on what you order.   

What appears to be \"worth it\"  
- Happy hour drink specials - $5 house wines and 1/2 priced cocktails were a sure winner
- The sushi options looked great and the prices weren't too out of line.  
- Some of the starters.  

What wasn't \"worth it\"
- The entrees - priced at $26-$36 on average, the few I tried didn't really blow me away.  It looks like a lot of food, but it's really just normal portions of fish and veg, with a double portion of starch.   
- The specials - order with caution! - prices are not disclosed in the descriptions, so I accidentally ordered $30 worth of King Crab legs (1/2 lb that was described as an appetizer portion) along with a $32 entrée (stuffed shrimp that I wouldn't have knowingly paid that much for).    

Overall, I'd go back, but with more of an eye toward ordering stuff in the \"worth it\" category."}
{"text":"Such a cool place! Stopped in for lunch and had a wonderful experience. Even got a free appetizer for checking in! Split an order of delicious calamari followed by a lobster roll. The roll was messy but worth it. Would definitely return and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Our first experience here was at the Yelp Shucking Good Time event and I ate a ton of fresh oysters and was truly in heaven. Oysters, East End Big Hop ale, what more could you want? We knew we'd be back. So we went for dinner and absolutely loved it!! At first glance the menu appears to not have an abundance of choices but there are specials based on availability of fresh fish which will supplement the base menu. And so it was on our visit. Soft shell crabs were in and I have such a weakness for them I'll pretty much order them anytime I see them. I was not disappointed. While I prefer then sautéed, these were fried but not greasy and were spectacularly flavorful and fresh. A good generous serving left me full to the brim, but I did have room for the second East End.... My wife's fish special (which she generously shared - she's good about that!) was a wild atlantic cod with fresh blue crab on top and  was so tasty and fresh that we each were satisfied when we left, knowing that we won't be strangers to this place. 

The atmosphere is open air and consistent with the theme of the place. A good bar, some great fresh seafood, unlimited oysters....this is a welcome addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene. See you there!"}
{"text":"After watching some of the runners at the Pittsburgh Marathon  I stop at Luke Wholeys  for the first time.  What a pleasant surprise.  Sat at the bar and the server Brain explained the different types of Bloody Mary's they made.  I choose one with horseradish infused vodka.  It was the best Bloody Mary I've ever had.  Ordered a rainbow roll also and it was very good.  Luke's is a must stop in the strip district."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Need to get someone making sushi again!!"}
{"text":"Loved the crazy Bloody Mary! We got ours topped with shrimp, bacon, and a whole soft shell crab!!! The food is good but I just probably ordered the wrong thing. I got the lobster roll tinder style and I was a little overwhelmed by the bread and french fries. The lobster and bisque were great but I should have ordered a different side! Can't wait to go back and try the sushi!"}
{"text":"Start to finish excellent service. The food was absolutely delicious! I had the lobster roll and 2 lbs of Alaskan king crab. It was cooked to perfection and is now one of my favorite meals of all time!! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the salmon salad with the lemon ginger dressing and the fish bites.
Both were delicious!

Cocktails were not great, Definitely don't need to have the Old Fashioned and the Moscow Mule was just okay. 

I would stick with beer.

Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"The food at this place was so good that my bf all but licked the plate I didnt even yell at him for it.

The food at this place is so good we even ate the garnishes and I am not ashamed.

Hot tip (for right now, May 18 2013):  there is a GROUPON for this restaurant, and as I'd been dying to try this place I bought one and made reservations the same night.  I'd been curious about htis place bc I used to drink here back in the 00's when I was young and the space was called Deja Vu inside.  It still looks like Deja Vu with the mulitple levels of seating and its gorgeous inside.

This would be a good restaurant for a date, dinner with the family, or a business dinner.  Our table had a beta fish on it which was pretty cool--until I almost knocked the bowl off the table bc I am clumsy.  Poor fish.  :(

We had no problems getting a reservation and were seated immediately upon our arrival--no waiting.  While the place did not feel packed, every table was full so I would recommend making a reservation, especially since they have a Groupon now.

I had the crab stuffed salmon and my bf had the seafood lasagna.  He was eating the seafood lasagna before the waitress had even set the plate down and I dont blame him, it looked FANTASTC.  The sauce was kind of a cheesy vodka sauce that was to die for and came with shrimp and scallops on the top of the lasagna, and he said they were mixed inside the lasagna as well.  When I asked him for a taste he gave me the most pathetic little corner bite.  It was very good but honestly, he wasnt sharing and he just looked so happy I wasn't going to press the issue.   the sauce was incredible.

My salmon was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  It came with roasted red potatoes and bok choy.  I've been thinking about the salmon since I had it.

Also, I noticed the $$$ price listing for this place.  Do you really want discount seafood?  Really?

I thought the prices were surprisingly moderate for the quality of the food you are getting and the overall dining experience.  I would not consider this to be an expensive restaurant, most of the entrees were $25 or lower.

I can't wait to come back ot this restaurant and try their brunch.  I also saw several other tables order sushi and it looked very good--I reallly cant wait to try it.  They also said they make the best bloody mary in town but----thats wrong bc *I* make the best bloody marys ever, so we'll just have to agree to disagree.  :)

Also--try the cheese cake.  OMG I dont know where they get it from but it was amazing.  I want to describe it further but I can't bc I need profanity to explain just how #$*%& good it was.

I love seafood and this is my new favorite dining spot in the Strip District!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I like this place for its vibe and casual atmosphere, not to mention the Bloody Mary's which I feel are among the best in town. The food is nicely presented. This visit I had the breakfast special, your choice of blackened ahi tuna, blackened swordfish, or steak, two eggs cooked to your liking, and home fries and toast. I went with the swordfish with eggs over easy. 

I happen to understand how to properly blacken fish. One key is for the filet to be thick enough so that when it's seared in a red hot cast iron skillet it doesn't over cook, is moist and not dried out. They missed the mark with a thin fillet that was over cooked and so somewhat dry. 

The home fries were good though, and the eggs were properly over easy. There was no options for the type of toast though. - just toasted Italian bread. 

Others in my family had the longest lobster roll, which my son and wife said was sub par. She knows her lobster rolls!

My 2 daughters had the crab cake sandwich and loved it. 

It's not that I won't go back here, but might limit my order to the Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent service and overpriced. I went here a few times for work meetings and always left disappointed. As a vegetarian I know this isn't the ideal place for me, but they weren't even very helpful or accommodating. There are much better options in the Strip."}
{"text":"Came in for a nice Valentine's Day meal. From the beginning, It looked like there was no hope and that Yelp had led me wrong. It took almost 15 minutes just to get bar service and my simple drink was wrong; a Dry Vodka Martini using Stoli vodka and adding three olives. It took 10 minutes to get the wrong drink. At the same time, I ordered the Old Bay Peel and Eat Shrimp. 

Once seated at a regular table, it took another ten minutes to get a server to come over. Once she came over, she was extremely rude about taking my order. I get she was rushed, but eye rolling and teeth sucking doesn't fly with me. I took Yelp's suggestion and ordered the Lobster Bisque Fries. Can we say over cooked Lobster with a nasty sauce? There was nothing good about the fries...except for the bacon...but bacon makes the world awesome. 

When the Shrimp finally came out, I was initially impressed to see homemade cocktail sauce. I was disappointed in the fact it was full of Horseradish to the point of being inedible. The shrimp themselves were okay. They had no discernable Old Bay on them. If I wanted plain shrimp, I would have ordered the Shrimp Cocktail.

I had to flag down a server to bring me a glass of water; I waited from the moment I sat at the bar until I finally grabbed someone to bring me water well after my Martini had been drained.

When my dish came out (I ordered the Seafood Trio) I think there were 3 full cups of pasta on my plate. The Mussels and Clams were chewy and very overcooked while the scallop (could only find one scallop, two shrimp, and three each of Mussels and Clams) was cool in the middle. The pasta was overcooked and the sauce just had a weird, sweet taste to it. The portion size was also way too large; I could've easily split the dish three ways and all three of us would've gone home full.

All in all.

Food: 4/10. The parts that were edible were okay.

Service 0/10. The server I had was extremely rude and inattentive. She could've cared less and it showed. Also, it was hard to tell who the servers were as no one was in what could even be remotely considered uniform attire: My server was wearing a spaghetti strap tank top and yoga pants, another server was in a nice black shirt and dress slacks, another server was in a red shirt and dress pants. The bartenders were inattentive and couldn't even make a simple drink.

For the price I paid, I could've easily have gone somewhere else that I know serves good food and had a great dinner. I'd go here if you had a gift certificate to cover the meal, or on a slower night so the chefs could be more attentive to what they are doing, but I will most likely never go back again. Poor service is enough to sour any meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Luke Wholey's at around 7pm on a Thursday. Though the restaurant was half full at most, we waited five minutes without someone seating us. Two servers said they'd be with us in a second, but after that never returned to actually get us seats. We left, and I sent a message to the restaurant through their Facebook page and have yet to receive a reply. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"After learning that there was a 45 minute wait at Spaghetti Warehouse,  we opted to go to Luke Wholey's.  We chose to to sit at the bar and ordered a couple of drinks. We studied the menu and decided on an oyster appetizer (all the hubby.... & at 1/2 off).... Lobster Mac n cheese,  provolone wedges & chicken poppers with Buffalo sauce. 

Everything came out in a timely manner.  Jayme (the bartender)  was friendly without being over bearing. The hubs loved his oysters & lobster Mac.  I really enjoyed my provolone wedges & chicken poppers. I was honestly full on just the cheese wedges!  

There was a young man shucking (is that the right word?!)  oysters and the owner must not have liked how he was doing it because he came over,  scolded the kid and started doing it himself.  It was really unprofessional,  especially because we were sitting less than 3 feet away and could hear everything! 

We will be back..... But not because of the owner,  but rather for the food and service."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. When I was here in the Strip District last year, we had plans but we ended up in their fish market instead.
Now here I am. I ordered the Panko and parmesan cheese breaded broiled cod. I also ordered the Peel and eat Baja flavored shrimp.
I didn't expect these shrimp to be made cold. It has the Baja flavor alright but maybe I expected it to be steamed or something. The cod also was okay, tasted okay. My partner's order was crab stuffed salmon which he liked, though he said it was a bit overcooked. We shared an appetizer which is the calamari, and that really did hit the spot.
I like the restaurants interior, with all those colorful wall painting, showing a carp and a giant octopus on one whole wall. It gives out a sort of homey feeling. Our server Tommy did a good job and was very attentive and I appreciate this.
Overall it was a good experience. But I think they are too pricey. Would come back to bring 
family who visits, but will not come on a regular basis. It's just too pricey!"}
{"text":"We went during summer and they had the doors wide open which was great. The food, drinks and atmosphere were good. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Slow service and mediocre food. Would not recommend. I've given this place several times to redeem itself. Not happening."}
{"text":"We had spent the whole afternoon checking out all the shops in the Strip District and it seemed like we needed to sit down and enjoy a relaxing drink. We wandered into this bar and a very nice bartender took care of us.  He was friendly and knowledgable. I had a very good Manhattan and hubby had a local beer. We didn't have any food, but the service and drinks were certainly worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great place great service.  They get all there fish from wholeys and breads from stores in the strip so you can't go wrong there.  Good selection of beers and a guy usually shucking oysters out front for the people that want a quick snack and not sit down to eat."}
{"text":"Made a visit to LW's about a half hour before closing on a Friday. No problem getting quickly seated and served, but it kind of bums you out when you're informed it's your last chance to get a drink before your entree has even arrived. They have to figure a better way to operate so that late arriving customers aren't shortchanged on the experience and offerings. Perhaps have drinks available for seated guests only? Keep the bar open an hour later? I don't know, but figure something out. Aside from that, the place was decent. I went with a Caesar salad and the hot pepper encrusted tuna. Both were fresh and tasty, and portions appropriate. The prices were just a tad high but despite all of this, I think I'd give them another shot when in town."}
{"text":"I had just purchased the Enjoy coupon book and was excited to see that Luke  Wholey Alaskan grill was in it. It is one of my and the  boyfriends  favorite places to eat. The food was Excellent as always. Our waitress , Meagan was attentive and recommended the crab stuffed salmon and it was excellent.  She brewed us fresh coffee and told us were to purchase it in the strip district. Two managers checked on us, which shows how much they want to accommodate.  Love the place. Definitely will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"First time I ate here over the summer the shrimp scampi pasta was delicious! Best I ever had. I hate when you go back to a restaurant and the same entree tastes different. This past Thursday my pasta was really buttery and the pasta and capers I had added to my order were not cooked well. My boyfriend also didn't eat his lobster mac and cheese and we aren't finicky eaters. However, sushi and crab cakes were amazing. Maybe their best chefs work on the weekends?? Advice: Just make your meals uniform no matter who is making them. Wait staff there is great. I may give them another try on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Not everyday I get thw chance eat lunch with a bear and moose elk head! 

I came in for lunch around 11:45.  
We were promptly seated up stairs. 
The room had killer blue lights and had kind of a night clubby feel.  
We got dine with stuffed bear and moose/ elk head! Totally made my after noon.

I ordered the crab cake sandwich (my lunch goto)

But id also love to seafood pasta or shrimp po' both lookes pretty tasty also."}
{"text":"This place was really cool.  Like a lot of places on the strip in Pittsburgh, it has open seating, but you can also be inside, while still feeling like you are outside.  It is definitely doing well with the 'theme' of a fish restaurant and looks like you are on a fishing boat with neat tables, etc.  Definitely a nice ambiance.

The food was DELICIOUS. Our party started with the Bloody Mary's and they were NOT disappointed.  Also -- definitely try the Bloody Mary shooters -- amazing! my fiance and I shared an ahi tuna salad, and it was phenomenal.  Definitely hit the spot.  To wrap up the meal we had some of the fresh shucked oysters -- what a treat.

The only downside was our waitress -- BUT I'm giving her a pass because it was only her second day and she was young ( I remember those days ... ) Besides that, everything was great, nice service, friendly guests.  If I lived in P-burgh, I'd be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, atmosphere is phenomenal! Everything is so fresh, well seasoned, melts in your mouth. Wide range of food selection. Large bar. Bloody Mary is very well prepared & served. Finger licking good!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but when the bill came there were issues.  I want to start off by saying Luke walked around and introduced himself and made sure everything was OK- which was very nice especially on a Saturday.  The food came out fast, fries where underdone, but sandwiches made up for that.

The issue...The sandwich board out front said bloody mary's $6 - we were charged $8.  When we questioned the price difference the waiter seemed baffled that we were questioning it.  Being in a hurry, we paid the bill.  We had 6 drinks  paying $12 too much for the bloody Mary's that my group consumed.  If we go back, we will push the issue if it happens again."}
{"text":"This is our third time back in the month of March.  Service is markedly better when it's not as busy.  Since our three visits, we managed to meet both Robert Wholey and his son who always graciously thank us for our patronage really creating a great atmosphere.  The community element needs to come back to every restaurant!

We came this time exclusively for sushi.  The final verdict is that nothing beats the Utsukushi Roll.  We came here to try other rolls for comparison, but nothing seems to compete.  While most of the food won't disappoint, there are true winners and gems at Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille. 

Kevin was an especially great waiter.  \"in heaven with Kevin\" as he would say.  Super attentive and friendly albeit mistaken about the Yum Yum roll tasting better than the Utsukushi."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place, so glad I did! I was really craving a lobster roll but they are only available for lunch and we arrived around 7. I knew I couldn't get one but was excited to eat there anyway. My boyfriend and I both ordered the special...
Alaskan king crab legs caught by the people from The Deadliest Catch! It cost $100 for 2 dinners but so worth it. They cut the crab so the meat basically falls out on it's own. They were insane. So sweet so meaty. Red skin smashed potatoes and charred asparagus were the sides served the crab. Everything was delicious! We also enjoyed the mini crab cake appetizer, complimentary, thanks to checking in on Yelp :) The staff was friendly and knowledgable on the menu. We also had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Wholey, he came to our table and introduced himself. They have a nice selection of craft beers. I had an All Day session IPA and loved it. 5 stars no complaints!!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a nice gentleman who I can only guess is the owner.  He made us feel at home right away and thanked us for braving the snow to get there.  He talked highly of the menu and was right. 
Our server was very knowledgable and, as expected, also very kind.  You could tell the staff was well trained as everyone we encountered was polite and welcoming.  
The food was reasonably priced for fresh seafood and the oysters were delicious.  Our waitress suggested three types based on my preferences and she nailed them. 
We are already planning our next visit; there were too many tempting options on the menu to try in one visit. 
Another perk, they now have a reward card which after one visit already got us halfway to a $20 credit.  
As we left, the gentleman at the door shook our hands and asked us to be safe on the snowy roads.  We will certainly be back.   I only wish we lived a tiny bit closer so we could visit more often."}
{"text":"So I was soooooooo excited to go to this restaurant per the pictures on Yelp and the comments. When my boyfriend and I walked into the restaurant it was aesthetically pleasing and the greeter and waiter was very pleasant. Being from New Orleans the first thing to catch our eyes was the Asian catfish...actually it wasn't the Asian part JUST A TASTE OF THE YUMMY FLAKY CATFISH!!!! We ordered it and there was no seasoning on the fish (this saddened me) but hey the dipping sauce helped. He (the boyfriend) then ordered a mixed drink, but it was like a play on hot chocolate and it actually tasted like a lemonade. Lol I think I liked it! My boyfriend didn't.   Lol then I had to order the lobster roll (this is what I came there for). So I ordered the hot one with the gravy over it and guess what?????? I DIDN'T LIKE THE LOBSTER ROLL!!!! BUT I LOOOOOOOVED THE GRAVY WITH MY FRENCH FRIES!!!!!  2 STARS FOR THIS PLACE BUT ONLY FOR THE GOOD ASS GRAY!!!!  YUMMYLICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"For Christmas every year my girlfriend is blessed by old Saint Nick with a slew of gift cards to local businesses usually near work or home. This year was exciting because we got $50 towards a visit at Luke Wholey's Grille. Obviously, we knew it would be different than the fish market, but curious to see how tasty things might be! 

We made our way down the Strip around lunch time so we were fairly hunger and ready to enjoy some free grub. Being that we had a gift card, it was a must to get an appetizer! Ball out a little, we thought! Decided on crab cakes, which were damn there perfect. The worst thing that can happen to a crab cake is too much oil, these were fried just right and there was fluffy crab meat all throughout. After that good treat, we were greeted by who I believe to be the owner, with our entrees. 

My GF got the Ahi tuna sandwich with a side of fries and I went with the Steel City lobster roll, also with a side of fries. We were both impressed with our meals! The amount of lobster that was on the roll was a pleasant surprise and my goodness how delicious and buttery it was. Me being me, I had to try a bite of my GF's tuna which was grilled nicely on the outside and just right in the middle. 

A great experience we had at Luke Wholey's and we do plan on returning sooner then later. Excited to try the dinner menu options and apps!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came for their Restaurant Week prix fixe menu. The atmosphere was more far casual than I expected for a quality seafood restaurant, but there was a good mix of people young and old and it felt lively. The service was friendly and prompt. 

Our appetizers were the ceviche and lobster bisque. The bisque was creamy with good flavor, while the ceviche was absolutely outstanding - colorful, fresh, and tangy. Our entrees were the filet mignon oscar and the crab gnocchi. The steak was a tender and flavorful and my girlfriend raved about her gnocchi. The deserts were another highlight. The vanilla cheesecake was what you would expect, but the flourless chocolate torte was a dream of creamy, molten fudge. 

The regular menu can be pricey and parking in the Strip is never enjoyable, but I highly recommend Luke Wholey's for it's superior product."}
{"text":"We're from the south and this place has one of the best po boys we've had. The atmosphere was fun and I'm sure in the spring and summer it's even better, there are 2 big clear garage type doors in the front that look like they can be opened. Our waiter was great. Our glasses were never empty, he stayed on top of bringing us refills even before we asked for them. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Yes, I didn't feel like cooking that night as Darren said, but with food this good, why bother? This was the best seafood I've had in forever! The Catfish Bites were amazing as was my fish 'n chips. Everyone was so nice from the waitress to the host to Luke Wholey himself. It was worth the hike."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about the food here. I've been coming here for years and introduced friends and family and everyone has loved it. Never a bad meal although the service on two occasions was subpar the manager more than made up for it. Fish n Chips is best around and you can add jumbo shrimp and scallops for an up charge which I recommend if you're hungry. The Caesar salad with homemade dressing rocks  and always a choice of mine. Salmon, blackened Swordfish and Alaskan king crab are all stellar entrees. A friend of mine even had their chicken parmesan and I was amazed it was pretty good  being this is a seafood restaurant. I rarely have dessert but the  pumpkin cheesecake was one of the best I've ever had and ordered it on two occasions although I'm not sure it was made in house. If you're looking for fresh seafood this is the place !!"}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary's here are the best and the food and service are great! Definitely a \"go-to\" when in Pittsburgh. After doing some shopping it's nice to stop in for a pick me up. I'm from Maryland so I know seafood and they do a damn good job with seafood!!!"}
{"text":"No sushi :( I hope this is temporary! This was a main selling point for me. Bummer.

On the upside, the popcorn shrimp is quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Showed up on Sunday just before noon.  Restaurant was half empty and specials placard outside. Upon entering an irritated-looking hostess asks how she can help our family of four.  We ask for a table and are told \"we have two large groups, so we can't serve food right now.\"  What?  Again, restaurant was largely empty.  I give two stars because the bar was open.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for appetizers and were more than pleasantly surprised. Our calamari was great (ask for the chili sauce to dip it in!) and the sushi was fresh and tasty. Our waiter was attentive and the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Drinks- local craft beer and oyster shooters hit the spot 

Service- Friendly and helpful

Atmosphere- Very enjoyable, artistic joint! Loved the atmosphere the most. 

Would definitely recommend stopping in for a drink if you are in the area."}
{"text":"You know it's not great when you mention that your seafood is chewy to your waitress and she does nothing. I ordered the appetizer combo which is a baby octopus salad, squid salad and seaweed salad. The baby octopus and squid salad were relatable to a nicer Chinese buffet; while edible, not at all what you'd expect from a restaurant specializing in seafood. When ordering, I asked if the seafood was fresh. She confirmed it was and when we inquired about the Wholey name she said they were not affliliated but their seafood was fresher than the market. The first time I mentioned the overly chewy seafood, the waitress simply said she doesn't eat anything like that so she doesn't know what it should taste like. The 2nd time I mentioned, she didn't react at all. 

My boyfriend had a softshell crab sandwich and it was good. That's why they get 3 stars."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the five-star reviews this place has been getting. It's a good location (heart of the Strip) and the space is pretty nice, but I'd say the food is merely OK. Service was slow (this was 8-10pm on a Saturday). The air was smoky (not cigarette, but grill) - poor ventilation. Expect $30 or more per person.

I tried the crab dip with tortilla chips - a new experimental dish not yet on the menu, given to us by the owner, Luke. This was certainly nice of him. But I found the tortilla chips, though just cooked, tasted stale. Perhaps the dough was old?

The crab-stuffed salmon was good but not great. The potatoes had a sweet sauce on them that I disliked. The bok choi was fine.

For better fish dishes at the same price, try Casbah. Or if you want to stay in the Strip, try Kaya - the food is better."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a couple of years, and I've never been disappointed, and last night as no exception.  Last night we found another reason to come back.  We were looking for a nice quiet evening before the holiday pandemonium, and we picked the right place to go.  Our meal was hot and served at the right pace, and we were ready to go.  Megan suggested coffee, and we were surprised at the quality... outstanding!  She said that she brewed it fresh, and we each received our own serving tray with a small pot of coffee, cream, sugar, and cup.  I'm glad that we stayed the extra time.  Next time, well get a dessert to go with the coffee.  Thanks for the recommendation Megan...and for chasing me down when I left my phone on the table."}
{"text":"I really expected better based on the reviews. The first  annoying thing about this place is that the tables are so uncomfortable to sit at. The tables are crafted out of old spools and they sit so much higher than a standard table. I am 6'4\" and was very uncomfortable. Second, most of what they serve  is deep fried to the point where the place fills up with this blue haze. It really makes your clothing wreak afterward. Lastly, it's the strip not Manhattan... way over priced for just \"ok\" food. There is much better and shame on me for not checking out the area first."}
{"text":"i was recommended by a friend to try this place. ordered the blackened catfish (recomended by the same friend. and let me just say it was fantastic!!! i ordered the sandwich it came on a french baguette type roll and was topped with fresh romain lettuce, two thick slices of what tasted like homegrown tomatoes and two rings of red onion. atmosphere is casual and the wait staff is great."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! I love this place because it has amazing quality food but the atmosphere is so fun yet relaxed. It's definitely not some stuffy seafood restaurant. I had the crab stuffed salmon and my husband had the shrimp and scallops. Both were amazing and very filling! We also had small salads to start and I have to say that the lemon ginger dressing g was the best dressing I have ever eaten. They seriously need to bottle that up and sell it because I would buy a case!!! The only thing that I would say that was not perfect was the fact that I didn't know they served sushi. I'm not sure if you have to ask for that menu because we didn't get to look at it. I only knew because the table beside us got some. I would have definitely ordered that as an appetizer if I had known. Looking forward to going back and trying the lobster bisque fries... Who ever thought of that must be a genius because they sound amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Everything you hear is true. The lobster bisque fries blew my mind.  If the service were better I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed when I came here recently for my birthday dinner.  This was the first time that I was bringing my husband to Luke Wholey's and was excited for him to try what I had felt was the best seafood restaurant in the area.  

I ordered the shrimp and scallop entree (blackened) and the shrimps were rubbery and the seasoning made the shrimp and scallops so dry.  While you could tell the shrimp and scallops were fresh they were overseasoned with the blackening spices and it completely overpowered all other tastes of the meal.

We ordered the lobster fries and calamari as an appetizer and I will say that these were good.  The cocktail I ordered was terrible but perhaps that had more to do with my personal preference in taste than the drink itself.  It was Wholey's version of the Moscow Mule (which I usually love) but they use Crown Royal Maple rum which made me feel like I was drinking watered down maple syrup.  It didn't have that limey refreshing taste that I usually enjoy.  

My husband ordered the Salmon entree and he was underwhelmed and said that the Salmon I had made the night before was better...and it was frozen Salmon!  

While I was really disappointed in the meal overall, I won't let it deter me from giving this place another try."}
{"text":"Definitely a solid choice for seafood in Pittsburgh. The lobster bisque fries are absolutely amazing. I can eat them for breakfast lunch and dinner seven days a week. Sushi is very tasty as the fish is very fresh. I haven't had anything on the menu that absolutely blows me away but I haven't had anything bad. The sushi is always a safe bet that any of the specials are phenomenal. The lobster rolls probably one of my favorite things. The bar is cool. Some of the drinks they make her a little too sugary for my taste. But if that's your thing then you're in luck. Have a decent beer selection nothing to write home about. All in all very solid choice for seafood in the strip District."}
{"text":"Ordered the lobster bisque...it was a very thick base that had no real flavor..there was several pieces of lobster at the bottom of the cup but would of been better if the lobster was thru out the soup.  I also ordered some sushi can't say forsure which one it was I know it had shrimp cream cheese and cucumber..the issue is it the rice was kind of hard not the sticky type I'm use to..it was just ok no real flavor..took sometime to come out saw that they where oviously having some issue the pos system went down and had to wait 15 min after asking for the check so they could print it out..most likely will not return."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Atmosphere is fun and upbeat.  Service was fantastic (thanks, Tammy).  We tried the mini crab cake appetizer and they were delicious.  I'm now obsessed with the King crab legs and have been thinking about them all week.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great fresh seafood in Pittsburgh! It was quite good. Lots of options. Really great fresh tuna in the sushi. I got the Baja shrimp volcano as it seems to be popular and it really made me want a bowl of the lobster bisque it's filled with. Mashed potato volcano was sooo good and I enjoyed the shrimp and lobster claw. Their food is well presented. Next time I will get the oysters!"}
{"text":"I wanted a cold seafood platter for the holidays and so I went to the website and emailed the catering manager.  I never got a reply so I called them this morning.  The person who answered the phone said he couldn't help me because they were too busy (on a Saturday) and asked me to call back.  I guess I am going back to Penn Fish!"}
{"text":"Five stars all the way! This restaurant is located in the strip district of Pittsburgh. It features an urban ambience with clear garage doors on the front on the joint that can be opened if the weather is nice, and hand painted brick walls of sea creatures, waves and a giant ship. When we walked in the restaurant smelled delicious. It put me right in the mood for our meal. 

We went during lunch time which is when they offer a lunch menu with lunch friendly options and pricing. Our bill for four entrees, one appetizer and one beer was $83. They also have a pretty insane Bloody Mary menu. You can customize your own by adding bacon strips, shrimp and other goodies. They looked insanely good!

Our server was amazing; super knowledgeable, friendly and gave great recommendations! He noticed my dad was drinking a TON of water and brought him a giant beer mug of water. Lol. The food was very tasty, unique, and was well presented. It was very appealing to the eyes!

Towards the end of our meal, the owner's father (who is the owner of the fish market), came by our table to check on us and we ended up chatting for about 15 minutes. He was a very neat and interesting guy. I'd love to sit down with him over a beer. 

I definitely recommend checking this place out! Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Easy stuff first - decor is really cool.  Yes, the fish on the wall are real.  The paintings are awesome.  Yes, that's Luke's dad on a lobster phone (though experiencing the real deal in person is even more interesting).  

The sushi there is excellent.  The individual pieces may be slightly smaller than the Slippery Mermaid's, but the quality is second to none.  The fish is fresh, tasty, and high quality - and for a very reasonable price.  

Lobster bisque fries are similar to gravy fries but with lobster chunks, and if you splurge the extra dollar (and why wouldn't you), bacon bits.  

Catfish bites are excellent - and ask for sriracha to add to the dipping sauce to make it the way they originally came when he first opened.  Definitely awesome & spicy.  Mahi Mahi tacos are another excellent appetizer.  

As for the cocktails - good gravy in the navy!  The ginger mule is excellent.  So is the Snozzberry.  

That said - the Bloody Mary is hands down the best drink available here - and possibly the best Bloody Mary I've had in Pittsburgh.  Spend the $3 and add the candied bacon.  It's absolutely, positively worth it.  You have to have this Bloody Mary.  That's all there is to it.  If for no other reason, go there and have this Bloody Mary.  Seriously."}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today with my father for lunch.  Not too long ago I had been here with a Yelp party and was lucky enough to taste some of their oysters and shrimp with the Oysters Rockefeller and shrimp both being delicious.  Since my dad likes a good fish, I decided that I would take him sometime for lunch.  We were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant and given the choice to sit inside or outside.  I chose inside even though it was pretty much the same as being outside.  You see, they have a garage door type device so that the restaurant opens onto the street.  With the perfect weather today, my dad and I both enjoyed our seats.

For lunch we decided to start off our meal with the lobster bisque fries.  It is exactly what you would expect from a name like that, a bunch of fries on a plate with a decent helping of lobster bisque dumped over them.  The bisque tasted awesome and I was pretty happy about the large chunks of lobster that were sitting on top of the fries.  While the fries tasted nicely too, I wasn't as big of a fan of how soggy some of them got.  Even so I enjoyed the inventiveness and taste of it.  For my entree I decided to have the shrimp po boy and chose the buffalo aioli to go with it while my dad went with the fried cod sandwich.  Both dishes came with a side of fries that looked like they were freshly cut. My sandwich was pretty good and I enjoyed the buffalo aioli but I think still think that it lacked something.  So while I liked it, I honestly can't say that I loved it.  My dad did say that he really enjoyed his sandwich as the fish was good. I should also note that our server was also very friendly to us and helped to make our experience nice.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While nothing during today's lunch jumped out at me as amazing and today's lunch on its own would be 3 stars, I do know that there shrimp here is very good, so maybe I just ordered badly?  In any case, I do think that it is worth stopping by to give a try."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dinner here. Kel was a good waiter. One mistake I handed my credit card to the manager so my dinner companion wouldn't have to pay. The waiter brought the bill over so the surprise and generosity was ruined. The location is cool. Open garage door, high ceilings and the tables are very interesting."}
{"text":"After getting gift cards for Luke Wholey's for Christmas, my boyfriend and I decided to save them for when the weather is nicer. Finally, the time has come that we've gotten nice, enjoyable weather and we decided to cash in on our gift cards. It's ok to go here when the weather is not so favorable, but I love feeling the breeze flow through a restaurant while eating, and it's nice to have the option to sit outside!

We split the crab cake appetizer (2 small crab cakes), and it was the perfect portion size for the two of us. The sauce that came with it for dipping was their Cajun aioli, and let me tell you as the self-proclaimed Condiment Queen that this is one of my favorite house-made sauces that I've tasted. I ordered the blackened ahi tuna sandwich cooked rare, the only respectable way to eat blackened ahi tuna. The sandwich came with the Cajun aioli and a generous portion of well-seasoned fries. Ahi tuna has a wonderful, fresh yet almost steak-like feel to it. Cooking it too long causes it to dry out and lose some of the lovely flavor and moisture it naturally has. It was grilled to perfection for the short time that it was on the grill, and that deep reddish color in the middle was mouth-watering.

My boyfriend got the Steel City Lobster Roll. He loves getting things that I don't cook at home when we go out, and I most certainly don't cook lobster at home. His sandwich came with huge, beautiful buttery chunks of lobster on it, and there was a good amount of Luke Wholey's lobster bisque on top. It was a work of art. If you don't like lobster, this sandwich may just convert you. When the waiter brought us our food he told us the restaurant was very proud of the Steel City Lobster Roll, and it isn't hard to tell why! Personally, lobster isn't my absolute favorite seafood as it can be a little sweet for my liking, but the lobster bisque balanced it out well. My boyfriend asked for a cup of the Cajun aioli on the side, and it was just as tasty on my sandwich as it was on the fries!

Overall, I felt like the pricing was fair at Luke Wholey's for the freshness of the food and the portion size. Fresh seafood can get pricey, and if you view the menu you will notice a slight jump in prices between lunch and dinner. The portion size and dishes differ at dinner, but since I was here for lunch our bill for 2 sandwiches and an appetizer was a fair $45. 

Trying one of Luke Wholey's Bloody Marys and some sushi is on my list for next time. The service was friendly and quick, prices were okay, and the food was fantastic. I can't really think of anything that would've made our experience better, so we will definitely be looking forward to our next visit. Definitely worth stopping here if you're in the Strip!"}
{"text":"I love going to the Strip District. it's the one place in this universe where I wouldn't shove someone out of my way for walking too slow. You just move with the crowd and surf the Strip wave! Me and my boyfriend went to Wholey's Alaskan Grille a few weeks ago and had a really great lunch! I ordered the Steel City lobster roll and my bf got crab legs. Both were so so good! The only reason why I am only giving 3 stars is because of the prices...yikes! My boyfriend only got the starter crab legs and it was pretty outrageous. I'll still go back but maybe for dinner where I can justify spending $100."}
{"text":"I am a seafood lover.. Not ever terribly picky.. But, I do pride myself on having a rather diverse seafood palette.. This was some of the best food I have ever had the pleasure eating! We had the sired ahi tuna & sautéed calamari as appetizers.. (Of course complimented with their famous Bloody Marys.. Which by the way has 20 some ingredients that all adds together for the BEST Bloody Mary of my life! I have craved one ever since leaving Pittsburgh!) But, I digress.. My boyfriend & I split the \"Land & Sea\" which included a 6 oz filet mignon, grilled shrimp, scallops & delicious mashed red potatoes. So, in conclusion, if you ever have the pleasure of going to Pittsburgh & only have a chance to eat at one restaurant.. Make it this one! You won't regret it! 
p.s. I forgot to mention the EXCELLENT waitress we had named Nonika (i'm horrible with names, so it may not be that) whose service was not only impeccable but professional & charismatic to boot."}
{"text":"I love Luke Wholeys!  This was my 2nd visit there, once for lunch, and once for dinner.  Both times were great.  This past visit we were in town for my 40th with my family and out of the 3 days we were there, this was everyones favorite.  Even my brother who can be on the picky side loved it!  Between 6 adults and 2 kids we sampled quite a bit on the menu and each dish was fantastic so I dont think you can go wrong here.  

Do yourself a favor and get the lobster bisque fries!"}
{"text":"We came here for an early lunch while checking out The Strip District. we started with the lobster bisque fries, which were very good. I had the Steel City lobster roll, which was delicious, and my husband had the seared tuna lunch entree. We both really enjoyed our meal. The service was great and attentive."}
{"text":"I had the salmon beet salad and the salmon was fresh and delicious.  I didn't partake in the Bloody Mary, (except for a taste of the bacon) but it was the most well presented bloody mary I have ever seen, and the candied bacon garnish was delicious. Our server was friendly. I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"So far we've had the amazing Bloody Mary's  oysters and lobster bisque fries. We visit from California and count the minutes till we can come here!  We are still waiting for our entrees... Food heaven 
We had hot pepper crusted seared ahi. Grilled yellowtail with wasabi sauce. Seafood pasta. So fantastic. Everything was perfectly cooked with amazing flavors. We got to meet Mr Wholey Sr. An absolutely wonderful man that took us on an art tour thru the restaurant and made this trip a memorable one for sure. Service was fantastic our server  Davin was wonderful. Sweet and helpful. Can hardly wait to visit again!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"Pretty cool vibe and the menu featured really fresh seafood.  Our waiter was super knowledgeable and made some great suggestions based on our conversation.  Definitely much more space and better service than Penn Avenue Fish Market.  The prices are just slightly higher than the norm on the Strip but nothing crazy.  Overall, solid food and very good service."}
{"text":"Ever walk by Wholey's grocery store and see a guy cooking sockeye salmon and thinly sliced zucchini on the grill? Well, that's Luke Wholey, who recently opened up his own restaurant on The Strip!  Open air dining where large up-cycled wooden cable rolls are surrounded by comfy chairs offer upbeat music for diners both upstairs and downstairs.  
As you approach, Luke Wholey is busy grilling sock-eyed salmon, jumbo shrimp and giant scallops and serving them with grilled zucchini slices, smoked red peppers and baby bok choy over your choice of steamed brown rice or sticky rice.  The freshly made lobster bisque a la Wholey's is 'slap yo momma good.' And that is just a sampling of items on the menu.  Best to call in, phone in or text in your lunch order if you've got a short lunch like me because The Wild Alaskan Grille is still going through some newbie growing pains.  Just be patient because it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I am so, so pleased with my experience here today. Three of us were walking around the Strip on a Saturday and we got pretty hungry around 1pm. I quickly pointed over across the street to this place since I've never been here. We walked in and were waiting on the hostess to seat us. I was looking around and most of the tables were full. Large TVs had march madness stuff going and orders were being delivered left and right. We waited not even five minutes to be seated, but the hostess appeared frazzled over so many people coming in.

We were seated at a table in the back left. It was a spacious table with comfy chairs. Our waitress walked over within a few minutes and she was so quick to get our drinks. I got water and unsweetened iced tea. I looked over the menu and became way too excited for sushi. It's absolutely my favorite thing to eat so I was ready to order the whole menu. I narrowed it down to miso soup, seaweed salad, tuna & salmon sashimi. The two other people I was with ordered fish and chips, a burger, and an Alaskan roll. We chatted while we waited and I felt like our orders came out fairly quickly even though the place was busy. Also, I noticed how it wasn't insanely loud. A plus for sure. 

My unsweetened iced tea tasted strong and I liked that because most iced teas taste very watered down to me. Heidi, our waitress, brought over my miso soup and shortly after my sashimi and seaweed salad were delivered. Oh my gosh my sashimi was beautiful, fresh, and extremely delicious! The same goes for miso soup and seaweed salad, which was the tastiest I've had so far in Pittsburgh. I was head over heels for my food. I've finally found the sushi I've been dreaming of. Heidi was fabulous at keeping our drinks refilled and coming back to check on all of us. I liked that she didn't abandon us after getting us our orders.

Towards the end of our meals, I decided I wanted to try a rainbow roll and asked if I could have it without rice. I wasn't trying to be a pain in the butt and I rarely ever ask for substitutions of any kind. Heidi said she'll see what she could do. She didn't say no and she didn't ignore my request. She put my order in and I was treated to an incredible modification with rainbow roll filling surrounded by a cucumber shell. It tasted amazing. I went over and praised/thanked the sushi chefs because they got creative and they provided excellent customer service. I thanked Heidi as well. She was so kind, bubbly, and an overall joy that added to our dining experience. We all adored her! Praise for the customer service, the food, and overall atmosphere. I was so happy and I'm definitely coming back for more of that sushi!"}
{"text":"In town for a wedding and wanted to have some good seafood. After seeing other strong reviews of this place, we made reservations and when we arrived, we were promptly sat. Our server, Shane, came right over and took our drink orders. 

Great dinner menu and a terrific soft shell crab special. We took our time ordering and never felt rushed. 

The entrees arrived, with the exception of mine; mahi mahi tacos. The server apologized stating that they were making the corn salsa because they were all out. Least mine would be super fresh! 

Mine finally arrived, and Shane said that it would be taken off the bill (nice surprise!). We enjoyed all our meals and would recommend this place; casual under-the -sea vibe and matching cool seafood entrees."}
{"text":"Good drinks and a great atmosphere. I had the calamari appetizer and it was lightly breaded and not over cooked. The basil marinara went really well with it! The lobster roll is delicious too! Not overly dressed."}
{"text":"Great experience here. There was a lovely band playing, the owner invited us in personally, and the food was delicious. I loved the modern yet nautical decor.  It is lovely during the warmer months when it's opened up to the street and you can enjoy the bustle of the Strip District while dining."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to pay Wild Alaskan Grille another visit to truly decide how I feel about it. We went there  on a  saturday (when it was mid 60s outside) so naturally the Strip was packed. We sat at the bar and the bartender quickly got our draft selections. They had a very good draft list by the way. Since it was lunch time the choices were not plentiful but we both ordered a cup of lobster bisque and my boyfriend ordered the cajun catfish bites. The catfish bites came out first. They were \"eh\" could have taken them or left them. Our soup was forgotten about. After we asked the bartender who did not take our order, we got the soup right away. The soup, now, was very good-it had plenty of lobster in it for the size of the cup and was very flavorful. The guys next to us at the bar ordered a large oyster platter which did look very good so I'd like to go back and try that. Now, our bill was $35. That was not the issue. The issue was that we asked to have it split in half and when we got our credit cards back each one had been run through for $26. Now $26+$26 is way more than $35. So I have no idea how he split it in half. When we pointed this out, he said \"I screwed that up huh?\", apologized, and corrected it. That bartender had great energy and you could tell he enjoyed what he was doing (or could at least act like it).I'd like to go back and try something else as their soup was promising but the catfish bites missed the mark."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! Fascinating artwork. Hip, trendy, friendly, professional... Oh, and did I mention delicious food & drink?!? Fresh, perfectly cooked & seasoned seafood. Tantalizing, spot on cocktails-- watermelon/mint mimosa & best Bloody Mary in town!"}
{"text":"Although Luke himself reached out to me, the service itself was horrendous. We waited 20 minutes before a server even looked at us. Finally we walked out with us complaining and they didn't seem to care. Time to hire an entirely new staff. Instead we went to a competitor named Osteria. Great food over there, skip the drama."}
{"text":"Food is okay. I normally get the Bloody Mary just because of the amount of fixins and extras but the actual taste of it is mediocre, I could care less for it. They need to spice it up with a different zing and add more alcohol."}
{"text":"My review is not about the food. Came for drinks with friends. Bartenders were unbelievably rude. Also they had to look up in a drink book how to make a dirty martini. (which they ended up putting sweet vermouth in) Worst. Bar. Experience. Ever."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best bloody Mary's I've had! They give you quite the selection of infused vodka's to choose from when your building your own bloody. New to the Bloody Mary life? Don't fret - they will mix you
up something tasty! Their seafood pizza was exploding with lump seafood - cheesy and delightful. I can't wait to get back here to indulge in more fresh seafood. Tip: Request a high top outside so that you can people watch while indulging in good food!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for drinks and appetizers on a Saturday. The interior of the building was very fun with huge murals of sea creatures on the walls. In the front, there was a guy shucking oysters. We decided to try the oysters and their Bloody Mary's. Also tried some sushi. Everything was great and service was awesome. I would highly recommend. Good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Had the Ahi Tuna for lunch on a salad with the Lemon Ginger dressing...seriously the best salad dressing I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here while visiting Pittsburg for the first time. The food was outstanding! I ordered the mussels...which were huge, the grilled salmon and the cheese cake....and I drank a scotch and ginger. The owner came came down and spoke to just about every customer...very friendly. Luke's will definitely be visited again before I head back to DC."}
{"text":"Great vibe. WA state oysters! Amazingly friendly staff. Garage doors open when the weather permits. Sushi bar. The ownership is creating a great to space for dining or just hanging out. Of course, I would like to see even more craft beers, but they are starting from a good foundation. Often have Dogfish specials."}
{"text":"Just don't know how to put into words how amazing that Steel City Lobster roll was at Luke Wholey's.  Instead of the lobster sitting in basic mayo with some cole slaw on a hot dog roll...this takes huge lobster pieces sauteed in butter and sits them on a hoagie roll - and, hold on, covers this with a generous ladle of lobster bisque.  Ok, sounds like a mistake - but oh my lord.  I wasn't that hungry at the time but I ate every last bit using that roll to soak up every last bit of bisque.  Homemade fries also helped to soak up that bisque.  So so good!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had a great meal each time. This place has a cool atmosphere  with an \"under the sea\" theme. Bar, dining, and outdoor seating. Service has always been friendly and helpful. 

The food was delicious and I will be back! Some of the sushi was pricey but worth the cost in my opinion! We went for brunch once and I had an eggs Benedict special which was fantastic! The lobster bisque fries were just okay and not as special as I thought they might be. 

If you are down at the strip and like seafood, you should definitely check this place out sometime! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Had a reservation, waited 35 minutes at our table and no one came, even though the hostess told us two times that someone would be right over. Went to the bar to order a drink while waiting and they took 5 minutes to acknowledge me and there were only 4 people sitting at bar. Place seems very dirty. Sticky tables and barstools, Windows dirty. Doesn't look like they clean much. I would've left and gone somewhere else but since I paid $25 for two glasses of wine I figured I'd better wait.  I'll update with my opinion on the food if it ever comes...."}
{"text":"First time here and my party ordered the catfish bites and mozzarella bites for starters. The catfish did not have a fishy taste at all and the batter used was light and tasty. Fried mozzarella was perfection as well. I ordered the cod in panko crumbs. Hopefully you bring your appetite because the portion of cod is quite generous. The combination of cod, capers, sauteed veggies was phenomenal. Another amazing find thanks to Yelp!! :)"}
{"text":"For a restaurant being in the Strip District, I was surprise how affordable our seafood dinner was compare to the other seafood restaurants were that weren't as good.  Everything was really fresh & portions was huge.  I'm a big eater & I actually split my entree. It usually takes me two entrees to get full. The appetizers were delicious! Our starters were the Thai shrimp, cajun boil shrimp, fried calamari & crab cakes. For my entree I had the frutti de mare pasta (which i split & came out looking like a full entree), others had the crab salad, shrimp scampi (it looked like it had over a dozen large prawns in it) and linguini with  clams.  This is a must go to again if i want seafood in Pittsburgh.  The host was really nice & even walked the tables to say hi & ask if our meal was ok. The waitress was pretty tipsy but got our orders out in time."}
{"text":"I had a great ladies night at Luke Wholey's. And we got to meet Mr. Wholey himself! He was very friendly and outgoing, and he gave us free dessert. The food is really good there. The Lobster Bisque Fries are amazing!!!!!!! I'm looking forward to another ladies night out at Luke Wholeys!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it. The oysters are incredible! We started with the oyster app and it came with some bonus shrimp. We also had the catfish app that was ok. The garlic bread is a must try. For dinner I had the blackened shrimp and scallops over rice with asparagus and it was incredible! My fiancee had the crab covered salmon and it was pretty good too. I have eaten here twice now and will be back."}
{"text":"This is definitely a go-to place anytime I'm in Pittsburgh.

Cool place with a chill vibe.  Staff has always been friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.

Almost all of their menu sounds delicious. But like a drug, I can't seem to stay away from the Steel City Lobster Roll (Chunks of cold water lobster meat, sauteed in garlic butter, served on a bun with fresh cut seasoned fries, smothered with house made lobster bisque and creme fraiche). 

But unlike other seafood places, Wholey's does NOT skimp on the meat...large pieces of whole lobster claw meat! And the lobster bisque they cover the sandwich with is great. I love when they give you a bit extra so you can dip your fries in it too.

Some day I'll try something else (having only ever had this sandwich is why I only gave 4 stars), but for now the Steel City Lobster Roll keeps me coming back on its own."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place, my friend and I enjoyed our sashimi and white fish.  The price is very reasonable too.  Our server was very friendly and attentive also."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to visit my brother and sister-in-law, we took a trip to the Strip district of Pittsburg. We stopped here for lunch as was very pleasantly surprised.

Being from the west coast we don't usually trust seafood places that aren't on the ocean. This place was great. The fish and chips were good and a single serving is enough for two. My wife had the Sockeye Salmon and was more than pleased. I was totally blown away by the seared Ahi, perhaps the best I've ever had. 

And the service was good, quick and fun!  Almost enough of a reason to move to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I REALLY wanted to like this place. Isaac Holeva from Faded/premiere innovations is always raving about it and I'll say I appreciate his enthusiasm about good eats. 

My fiancé and I went this evening arriving about 15 minutes early for our 6:30 reservations (not needed place only had five tables sat) and were immediately a little put off. There were two girls behind the bar with a deer in headlights look... after a little deliberation between the two one decided she would seat us, but only after going to talk to one of her tables. So we waited awkwardly for several minutes before she came over to seat us. We choose our own table in the dining room, as apparently that was the norm, and aside from one hideous piece of art it was quite nice. High ceilings, murals of fish on the walls and some tables were actually accented with fish bowls.

After sitting for ten minutes without so much as a greeting, and without menus I might add(she claimed to have no idea where they were??), a waitress came to get our drink order. We ordered the Rodolfo Malbec ($40) and were finally allowed to see the menu offerings. The malbec was a little on the lighter bodied side for me but tasty nonetheless.

The waitress returned with our wine about 12 minutes later and poured both glasses without offering a taste or checking to see if it was even the right bottle. Aside from the obvious time dilemma, this is a clear sign of poor training/management. Regardless, we ordered. My fiancé selected the lobster bisque to share with me and the shrimp and scallops with the lobster buerr blanc preparation. I chose the land and sea pairing of 6oz filet with three jumbo shrimp and a scallop served with smashed redskin potatos and charred asparagus.

Another 10 minutes went by before her soup finally arrived. The bisque appeared a little darker than I am accustomed to seeing them and I immediately suspected the rue was burnt. sure enough there was a bitter tone that muddled the flavor of this bisque which did sport some nice meaty chunks.

The food arrived about 15 minutes after the soup and I must say this was the highlight of the evening. Everything was cooked perfectly! The lemongrass on the steak was an excellent preparation and the shrimp and scallops were broiled to perfection. There was an obvious fresh quality to everything and I must note the shrimp especially was a little briney as if fresh out of the ocean. The scallops were the best thing on both of our plates!

We devoured everything and decided to stay for an after dinner drink. The cocktail selection offered several delicious sound cocktails and we opted for a lemon basil martini. It sounded so good but after waiting for literally 15 minutes while 3 people sat behind the bar doing nothing we decided to simply leave.

Overall I would rate the place 6.75 out of 10. The staff was awful and it seemed people appeared out of nowhere to stand around and do nothing. There was no apparent management figure, although I did see luke himself come to 2 tables to deliver food. They need a serious overall in the GM department. If not I would expect to see more 5 table nights and an early exit from what must be a high rent area."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow-y. Their oysters are to die for! 

Now that you know that, I shall put up a proper review. My boyfriend and I were taking a much needed shopping trip to the Strip and we were starving. Outside of Kaya, I'm not sure that I've eaten at any other restaurant in the Strip until this place. One of my boyfriend's good friends (who works for Clique Vodka) helped with getting the place up and running yet this weekend was our first time dropping by.

We sat at the main bar (of course) closest to the sushi bar and started with our favorite weekend drink, mimosas. Our bartender was super cool, forget her name. We looked over the menus for probably forever and couldn't decide what the hell we wanted. My boyfriend said something about the buckets of oysters sitting near us and one of the employees, Eric, started telling us about where each came from and their taste and texture. Then Luke jumped in and showed us this super tiny little oyster and gave it to my boyfriend to try. He loved the taste of it, but unfortunately it was the last one! I forget where it was from.

Based on Luke and Eric's recommendations we ended up ordering 4 of 3 types of oysters. Plus, Eric threw in a \"bonus\" oyster for each of us! :D Also, check in if you do the Foursquare thing. You can get either 3 free oysters, 1 free appetizer, or 1 free Clique Vodka drink. We decided to do a free app and ordered the peel and eat shrimp. This girl was in her happy place.

The oysters were so delectable and the shrimp had a nice taste from the Old Bay seasoning. I have a love/hate relationship with Old Bay because most people like to drown their seafood in it.  

We got to chat with Luke about starting up the restaurant, their first Friday sushi happy hour, and his trip with my bf's friend down to New Orleans for the Great Seafood Cookoff, or something like that (he was stationed next to a previous Iron Chef winner hehe). All in all it was a highly enjoyable experience, one we weren't even expecting. I loved it, and I know we'll be back, especially to try out the sushi."}
{"text":"For the money, go somewhere else! I ordered the mussels with white wine and it was ok, they need to learn how to cook shellfish! 

For my entree I order Caesar salad with Shrimp and Shrimp was cold and like leather!

I was disappointed...."}
{"text":"Good, fresh seafood with solid portions and the prices aren't bad.  The atmosphere is pretty urban-music, lighting, etc.  The high top tables which were actually old cable/wiring spools were neat and the seating was well spread out.

Oysters were good, and the spicy tuna appetizer was the highlight.  Sushi-grade tuna with a spicy coating served atop wasabi cold slaw.  

The tuna was so good, I ordered it again for my entree, this time as sweet and spicy with similar coating and a lighter teriyaki glaze.   Wasabi mashed potatoes actually contained a little bit of spice-normally I get pulled in with the description and they're no different than regular ones, not these! 

Good drink menu and the draft beers were cold.   I'd recommend coming here whether you're a local or occasional visitor to the area like myself."}
{"text":"YUP, here again !!  
Their seafood is so fresh and they make an amazing bloody mary!!  Gee, what more do you want in a seafood restaurant.  
Staff is always very friendly and helpful, place is clean and I love the outdoor seasonal seating.   

Went for a late lunch, as I always do and ordered crab cake app., it was 95% crab meat with a tiny bit of binder to hold it together, super good.  Their shrimp is always HUGE and weather I get it cooked or cocktail it tastes amazingly fresh.  They have a $12-13 lunch special menu which we ordered the Ahi Tuna with wasabi sauce; another hit.  I got a few raw oysters ... because I just can not pass up their yummy brineyness-as always.  Downed a crisp shrimp Caesar salad with a flavorful anchovy dressing.  

Aside from their totally rocking bloody marys, today we ordered a Paloma; a very refreshing grapefruit/lime/tequila drink.  I like it better than a Margarita, just make sure you get it with WHITE tequila (Blanco) it is MUCH better, I promise you that.  

The only issue I have with Luke Wholey's is the food is so delicious, I want to try everything so...... When we go for lunch, our bill with tip is usually around $80.00.  I am not saying they are overpriced, just so darn good that we order many plates to share and ...well.... it adds up fast.  That being said, at other establishments, I have had awful food and terrible services and paid the same.  I Do NOT mind dropping a few on awesome food and service.  We will be back Luke Wholeys !!!  Sure will."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check out Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille for our anniversary this past Friday night.  The food was truly excellent.
The lobster bisque was robust and flavorful, featuring two very large pieces of lobster claw meat, as well as plenty of other small bits of lobster.  My husband had yellowfin sashimi.  It was hands down the best thing we ate on Friday evening.  Sliced paper thin, nearly melt in your mouth, the presentation with fruits and veggies, it was just fantastic.
My husband had an upgraded Alaskan white salmon for his entree.  He could not stop raving about it.  It was light and flakey, very flavorful and grilled perfectly.  My entree was grilled sea scallops and shrimp."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Luke's, and I must say I was highly impressed. The service my friends and I received was top notch. Brian our server, was patient and attentive as he helped to assist with our selections. He was knowledgeable of the menu items and pairings. 

I ordered a cod fish sandwich and it was cooked to perfection....I mean it was absolutely delightful. It arrived with fresh cut fries, the appetizers were also delicious. I had the calamari, and spring rolls from their made-to-order sushi bar. All were well worth it. 

The atmosphere is pleasant. Great for a date night or family/friends gathering. 

I will certainly make additional visits to Luke's. Thanks for an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Quick mid-day bite while shopping on the strip. 
The best Bloody Mary ever! Add grilled jumbo shrimp! Was perfect on an unseasonably warm day. Accompanied by conch fritters, light batter, not greasy. And Thai chili fish bites, extremely tender with a light batter and Thai chili sauce with a slight kick. Portions was huge for an app. Service was fabulous! Our waitress was very attentive, it was busy and we were. It rushed. Decor represented the cuisine, seafood. Great menu choices. Will defined need to come back for a real meal to try out the other items."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a while now, and I finally found someone willing to stop in with me and split an appetizer and an entree--was it worth it? I still don't know. I'm trying so hard to enjoy LWWAG, but maybe it just needs some time...

Luke was outside to greet us and was enthusiastic about us coming in. After having an oyster bloody mary shooter (it sounds weird, but it was delicious), we decided that we'd do our shopping and then come back for a bite to eat.

The oysters were excellent. The food was prepared well. The crabcake was alright--we ordered it mostly because the server said it was different from other crabcakes (it wasn't) and she really like the aioli (which they forgot to give us). No big deal, though, we asked for it and after a few minutes our server came out with it.

So, here's the reason this review is boring: I feel so ambivalent about this place. One person sat us, another person introduced themselves as a hostess, another person brought us water, yet another person introduced herself as our server, and then two other girls checked in on us at various times. Who was taking care of us? Who was remembering what we had? Who had any interest in our experience? We were told the same thing by at least three of the people...and why would you recommend a dish because everyone enjoys the aioli and then forget the aioli? What?!

Also, I don't know if I can justify the price of the food with what was presented. That being said, it's a new restaurant and the space has so much promise (it could be open a little later, it could have a nice bar and some drinks, it could get rid of that screen playing God-knows-what while they're trying to charge you for a $20 entree) and the people are so friendly that I think it just needs time to settle in.

I can't wait to go back and try LWWAG again in a few months."}
{"text":"For a first time experience, this place was GREAT. We came at around 12 on a Wednesday, so the place was pretty empty and we were seated immediately. 

The service was what you hope for when you go out...we had Chris and he was completely attentive, knowledgeable, and just so upbeat and happy he made our first time excellent. He went out of his way to make sure we were happy! 

The food was WOW! We came for the lunch menu, so it was very reasonably priced (im not sure what dinner is like). Obviously you have to come with a taste for seafood, but they have an incredible selection of sandwiches, entrees, apps, and sushi. My group for the ahi tuna sandwich, lobster roll, and shrimp po boy and we all left completely satisfied but not over stuffed which was perfect! 

Absolutely recommend this place if your looking for something perfect to eat in the strip."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing! We have dined-in on a couple of occasions and for the past month I've been ordering takeout every Friday to bring to have lunch with my husband at work. The food is fantastic. Freshest fish & seriously abundant portions. I'm impressed that the take out meals are just as fabulous as the dine-in ones. On our first visit, we ordered the fish sandwich for our daughter...she's not 2 yet so it was far too much food for her but it was a beautiful cod sandwich at a beyond reasonable price. Luke came to our table to see if she enjoyed it. Had I realized it was him I probably would've told him he could shrink the sandwich a bit for smaller mouths and charge more if he wanted to! It was delicious but by the time she was done, you couldn't tell she ate anything! I'd love to see some grilled fish sliders with a side of carrot chips on the menu for the little ones. The lobster salad sandwiches (lobster rolls) are PERFECT. They seem to be made with simple ingredients but the taste and presentation are spot on! They are picturesque lobster rolls! We have had both versions and prefer the cold salad sandwich. The lobster bisque is very good but almost more of a lobster chowder. I always expect bisque to be a velvety buttery soup. That's probably my idea of what it should be rather than textbook bisque. Theirs is delicious, but has large chunks of lobster in it...whose complaining, right? The ambiance inside the restaurant is casual and fun, very appropriate for the location and style but we were still surprised and impressed when our plates arrived. All entrees far exceeded our expectations especially given the casual atmosphere. We'll be back today...it's Friday!"}
{"text":"Went last night with my wife for a date night.  We wanted to try someplace new and she wanted seafood.  I stumbled across the reviews here and decided to give it a shot.  I have to say I was quite pleased.  

We were quickly seated and our waiter came over to take the order.  He was really good and made suggestions on both food and drinks.  We had the catfish bites as an app and it was excellent!  The fish was lightly breaded and the thai chili dipping sauce had a fantastic flavor.  

For dinner, we both had the shrimp and scallops meal with two different preparations.  Both were very good but the blackened one was excellent in my opinion!  The only negative was the asparagus.  It seemed like it had been grilled hours ago and left to sit in a steamer or something for a long time.  It was tough, stringy and tasteless.  When I mentioned it to our waiter, he apologize profusely and offered us a dessert for free.  We ordered dessert but turned down the freebie as the bad veggie certainly didn't ruin the overall meal.

I only gave it four stars because: a) it is kind of noisy inside and would be very noisy if the place was packed, b) the ambiance is a little strange, and c) the bad asparagus.

I will definitely try it again in the future though."}
{"text":"Great oysters and lobster mac and cheese. Great place to eat tapas style--they have a long selection of amazing seafood appetizers. Only weakness I would note is that maybe it is a bit too loud."}
{"text":"We liked it here!

Food: It was good. I do not really know how to review sea food yet - working at refining my sea food knowledge. It tasted fresh.

Price: Reasonably priced, especially for seafood. We were surprised at how low the check was in comparison to other places we've been. We even asked our server if he made a mistake and didn't bill us enough! Turns out the place is just affordable.

Drink selection: Many options! Very pleased.

Atmosphere: Not so good for children. Good for a young couple but not romantic or anything. Good for friends and family. Kind of loud, casual dining.

Service: Personable server who was knowledgeable about the food. Kept the drinks coming perfectly. No complaints.

I would definitely go here again if I was in the mood for seafood."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place...it's not far from my work, it's a cool, huge, space, and one time a guy with a lobster megaphone heckled me as I got into my car after work and it was kind of endearing.  Also, I'm a huge fan of all food under the sea.  But it just hasn't quite figured out what it wants to be.  

The premade caesar salad, fresh out of the cooler with the dressing on the side, and the servers in shorts and sneakers makes it seem like a casual bar place (no liquor license though...be warned!  Bring your own, or they'll let you bring something from across the street).  

The prices of the (limited) entrees (all over $20) and the super-over-attentive service makes it seem like it's aiming for fine dining.

And then there's the loud top 40 music and the big projection on the wall of music trivia, like you're watching the comcast \"today's hits\" music channel, which makes it seem like a nightclub.  Yeah, I'm baffled.

The fish entrees were fresh and delicious (although portions were too much...maybe cut the price AND the size?) and we had some incredible cheesecake.  Everyone was so nice and the place was so empty and really, I'd love for them to succeed.  But unfortunately, I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Almost proper fish and chips.  The fish was very fresh and battered well.  Prices were reasonable and the waitstaff was very entertaining.  No pretenses here."}
{"text":"The food was good, however, the service made a giant difference in the experience. I was with a party of 7 so I expected a slower service. When a table of 4 left bc they were not asked for drink a drink order after 30 minutes it meant something. It took at least 20 minutes to get our first drink from order to the table. I feel they needed more service staff as one girl did the entire place. She did great, but they need to re-evaluate service staff levels."}
{"text":"My husband and I last minute decided to come here with our two small boys while in Pittsburgh on a trip. It was seriously one of the best places we ate at while here. It doesn't look like much from the outside until you walk in. Super cute and somewhat eclectic. We were quickly sat and our server was AWESOME! Best service I've had in awhile. She was very friendly and sat down to talk to our oldest. We exchanged stories throughout the evening about our kids. She made sure the kids were always taken care, which is HUGE in my book. I got a sangria and it was delicious! They have a good variety for drinks. We ordered edamame and sushi for apps. It was good! Our dinners... EXCELLENT!!! I highly suggest this place. If I come back to Pittsburgh this is a must!"}
{"text":"Simply FANTASTIC! The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and funny. Please try the oysters, salmon, and swordfish. 

Luke is incredibly friendly and approachable. 

An absolute must visit!"}
{"text":"Four of us went to the Wild Alaskan Grille last weekend.  Weather was perfect, doors to the Strip were open, table was large and high.  Started with cocktails, Angry Orchard - yum.  Appetizers were great, with quite large portions.  I had the swordfish with new potatoes and cabbage - what a perfect and unusual combination - loved it.  The show stopper, however, was the shrimp & scallops...  I for sure had scallop envy!  Our server, Troy, was excellent, happy and attentive.  Fellow patrons were an ecclectic lot - we were jeans casual, neighbors to the right were full out-on-the-town diamonds and pearls and to the left were a family of cyclists... complete with Papa wearing silver racing shorts.  Two take aways:  Scallop envy can be fixed.  Bicycle shorts should only come in black."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is unreal!!!  I know this restaurant has been around for a couple years and I am mad at myself for not going in sooner!  The Bloody Mary was the best one I've ever had.  Also had the blackened catfish sandwich which was ridiculously amazing!  Service was kick ass too!  If I could give 10 stars I would!  I'll be back many times for sure and recommend to anyone going into the strip!!!"}
{"text":"There are quite a few reviews already for this place so I'll keep mine brief: 

Very nice atmosphere and excellent service can be found here at Luke Wholey's. It's a bit pricey but the rainbow roll that I got was outstanding. I also got a free appetizer by checking in on my phone with my Yelp App. I elected for the lobster bisque for the appetizer. It was very thick with plenty of chunks of lobster meat in most spoonfuls. Simply delicious.

Although I can only recommend the sushi for now, I'd like to stop in and try some of their other seafood dishes. From what I saw on other peoples plates, the meals look superb."}
{"text":"Seated right away, even though it was a game Sunday. Host was great but server, JV, was not friendly. 

I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict. It was what you would expect, not amazing. The potatoes were seasoned well and really good. The food came out really quickly, I waited less than 10 min. 

If I were to come back again, I would try the sushi or cooked salmon entree."}
{"text":"A very good restaurant in the strip district.  Their seafood is fresh and they have an amazing burger for those who aren't interested in seafood.  They have a couple of local beers on tap.  The interior has a cool warehouse vibe."}
{"text":"It was acceptable.  I would go back, but it surely wouldn't be on the top of my list.  Food was standard, no complaints, but nothing outstanding, none the less.  Prices are a little high for standard fare....."}
{"text":"YUMMY FRESH SEAFOOD!!!! That equals a happy experience in my book. The oysters at Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille in the Strip are total perfection. Slurp one of those and you are instantly transported mentally to the beach. We ate so many of them at a recent Yelp event that we nearly shamed ourselves. As a result, we couldn't wait to return for dinner and we didn't wait long to make that happen. 

My hubby and I order a calamari starter pretty much everywhere we go. We're obsessed and we make no apologies! No apologies needed for the calamari here! Super fresh, lightly breaded and cooked to tender, mouth watering delight. The basil marinara it was served with was a bit bland, however. Punch up the dipping sauce and its a home run.

Being the seafood haven that they are, they also serve sushi. I ordered the charred tuna and it was every bit as fresh and delish as I'd hoped.

For dinner my husband ordered the soft shell crab special and he raved. I also have a crab addiction, just not for soft shells. I took a bite of his and as soft shells go, they were good - just not my thing. He just kept making happy, crunchy food noises next to me.

More to my liking was the Broiled Atlantic cod topped with colossal lump blue crab served with lobster cream sauce. It came with a side of grilled asparagus and I opted out of the potatoes in favor of their roasted root veggies as my 2nd side. The lump crab in that sauce had me making those happy noises every time I took a bite and there were lots of hearty bites to be had & I even shared with my boy. I'm sure it was intended to be a complete bite with the cod, I just couldn't make myself do that. The cod was really good and very fresh but for me the crab took the starring role.  The portion was big enough for me to take home lunch for the next day - minus the crab that I'd inhaled.

I could have had a whole plate of just that lump crab and probably would have upped to 5 stars. Can this be added to the menu??? Actually anytime a lump crab entree is on any menu, I order it.

We walked by on a recent Saturday and saw this restaurant was bumping at lunchtime, which I was super happy to see. Luke's is a welcome addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene and I'd love to see this restaurant do really well. I can only imagine what is yet to come here and I'm excited for it!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food awesome.   Fresh oysters were delicious! Was my first visit to Lake Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food=really yummy.

Service=non existent.

Saturday night was hopping, which seemed to overwhelm the staff (maybe they were short?).


The host, Jerry, could not have been more gracious.

But We waited a good 10+ minutes before someone acknowledged us after we were seated. We flagged down a nearby server who wrangled a colleague.  

Barely saw our server throughout the meal. Drinks were empty for a long time.

But the food was really great. 

we were not in too great of a hurry so would welcome giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"We had unreasonably slow service that even though I did enjoy my meal, I felt the restaurant deserved a sub-par review. I went with the large group and we surprisingly didn't have to wait for a table on a weekend afternoon. Really like how they have huge circle tables for large groups. However, it took us three hours to finish the meal. Every part of the meal was slow - taking our orders, checks, etc. Our waitress forgot to put in our order, but was nice about it and gave us a free round of drinks.
 
Anyways, I ordered a Blood Mary to start, its highlight is that it's served with two plump shrimp! For my main, I ordered the crab cake sandwich and loved it. Perfect ratio of ingredients, with more crab flavor than breadcrumbs/filling. I'm a HUGE seafood fan, so the food and ambiance are worth a return trip, but I'll be wary if I have time constraints."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while my son and I were in the Strip district shopping around. The place had pretty much just opened, and we had the place to ourselves for a while. My boy was attracted by the fact they serve sushi (11 year old aficionado), so he selected a tuna roll as well as the salmon with sweet soy for his entre, while I picked some blackened shrimp.
The server was very attentive and solicitous throughout the meal, even as others arrived to eat. When the food came, the boy was very happy with the sushi (\"This is terrific! Try a piece!\"); he really enjoyed his salmon as well. My shrimp was very tasty, and we both enjoyed the jasmine rice and steamed broccoli; the sweet soy feathered across the plates made for a wonderful presentation.
I think the lad has a new favorite seafood restaurant, and I'll give him no guff when he wants to return. Terrific food and service, in a venue with decor that, for the kiddo, brought a chuckling Sponge Bob reference to mind.
Great place to eat! Well done!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Luke's. Enjoyed a great salad topped with Wild Alaskan Salmon. Wife had a great fish sandwich. Service was very good as well. With the check I used a $12 off Enjoy Coupon Book coupon. When server returned with the adjusted check, he pointed out restaurant's policy when using Enjoy coupon was to automatically add an 18% gratuity to the subtotal before discount. Not only is that not stated on their coupon but when calculating the 18%, they do it not just on the subtotal before discount but they add on the 7% sales tax. Tipping norms are that you don't include the amount WITH tax, when calculating tip, but it's the amount WITHOUT tax."}
{"text":"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing! The lobster bisque goes good with absolutely everything! We got the lobster bisque fries as an app and even ended up dipping my sons chicken tenders into it, it was that good! Staff was knowledgeable and friends, great atmosphere. If I didn't live in Texas, I'd eat here much more often but it is now a must have when I visit!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is not exactly close to the ocean or known for seafood but when I get the Cape Cod blues, or long for Boston or a real Maine lobster, this THE only place to get seafood that's flown in fresh daily. You'd think you were down east."}
{"text":"Several weeknights ago, with Kay's hand in mine, the duo that is us walked several blocks once I met her at work half past the hour of 5 in search of Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille, a curveball thrown by her ('I don't feel like cooking tonight.') prompting this excursion. 

I knew it was on Penn Avenue, but aside from that, I had forgotten where it was! 

So we stayed on the move, the late afternoon sun glaring upon us until I caught sight of a  fearsome, azure fish mounted on a wall of stone above the restaurant's stylized logo. 

Thirsty and relieved to find the place, I crept in cautiously as dapper men and leggy women cavorted about the colorful interiors while a monstrous swordfish loomed over them. I even witnessed veteran local television news anchor Sally Wiggin in attendance \"living it up\" as they say. Would I be welcome among this seemingly upper-crust, formally-dressed crowd in my lightly soiled t-shirt and jungle fatigues?

That's when I literally stumbled into Luke Wholey himself wearing blue jeans and a polo shirt. 

\"You're fine, man,\" he said waving his palm when I asked about my appearance. It suddenly felt as if we'd grown up together even though I'd never before met him, his enthusiastically entrepreneurial, seafaring, and youthful visage being a fixture of Pittsburgh billboard advertising over the past few years. 

\"Man, these tables look familiar,\" I mentioned as we were seated in front of massive reels of wood meant for electrical wire. Luke informed me that they'd been procured from my employer as a band began to set up their instruments behind us. My ease was now complete. \"So let's eat!\" I exclaimed.

Kay is rarely in the mood for raw oysters, so we went with my secondary choice, the Catfish Bites, to kick off our dinner. 

Besprinkled with pungent Cajun spices, dredged in a cornmeal coating, fried to an exquisite bronze, and served with a sticky, honeyed sauce, the cubes of ray-finned polliwog were so newly captured as to be ethereal, vanishing in my mouth, leaving only a cakey, demon-dusted breading and freshwater flavors behind. 

My entree was the extravagant Broiled Atlantic Cod. Topped with Colossal 
Lump Blue Crab, the crustacean's most premium meat, served with smashed potatoes, garnished with grilled asparagus, and topped with a bisque-ish Lobster cream sauce, there was nothing but divinely moist pleasures to be had, only the spuds and vegetables providing earthen respites between the aquatic, erotic morsels of recently-expired marine life. The luscious, juicy crabmeat and cod vaporized just as the mudcat before it had, the ripe, not-overcooked asparagus and lumpen tuber heap adding some texture, the sauce ramping up the decadence dance as a Hollandaise would an Eggs Benedict. 

Dessert was a wedge of uncanny cheesecake from A. Ward's of Carnegie. Therefore, it warranted a separate review.

There were a few very minute gaffes, but our able and toned server Alyssa rectified them all gracefully. 

3/4 of the way through our meal, we were approached by the establishment's profoundly professional and personable host whose name I can't recall. As classy and charming as Johnny Carson, he recounted Luke's story to us, engaging us and our fellow patrons with his witty persona, visiting every table, hugging and hand-shaking like the man-of-the-people he indubitably is, treating each guest like a good friend. 

Take from this what thou wilt: Luke Wholey is serving up the finest, the freshest seafood I've ever had the privilege of tasting in this humble metropolis, our experience confirming my theory that if a grille is bearing the century-famous Wholey's name, only a blessed seafood tour de force can be had there. Clock in, spend some time with Luke, and sample the rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans of the world while never leaving the city limits."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place! The menu looked great, we liked the vibe and both shrimp appetizers were really good. The drink menu looked fun and inventive  BUT then the entrees arrived.... my husbands had the most potential. The halibut could have been lovely if not for being dry as a bone with bland flavoring and no sauce that could have helped the dryness. My salmon was just bad and sad  the crab on top was actually ok but the sauce was an odd mix of mismatched flavors and the salmon was so over cooked it could have been served as a hockey puck!! 
I might try again but would stick to apps and drinks."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant Saturday evening with my husband ,daughter, and her boyfriend.. We had a reservation, and were promptly seated. The restaurant has a nice open air about it and the decor is nautical with bright wall murals and tables made of large spools. The menu has something for everyone. We all enjoyed the food and the hospitality. I was impressed how the waiter continually checked on us before and during the meal. I wasn't feeling particularly well that evening, and saw a kids grilled cheese on the menu. I certainly didn't want to impose, but asked the waiter if I could order it! I expected him to say no, but he enthusiastically said, \"of course\". It was delicious and helped settle my queasy stomach. Everyone else in my party loved their sushi, salads and fish dishes. We will definitely come again.  A great place to bring a larger party. Good food, nice staff and considerate service. The only thing I would suggest was a little more light. When it got dim outside and they turned down the lights it is difficult to see. A candle or small lights above the tables would increase the ambiance of the restaurant. Otherwise, I recommend the establishment."}
{"text":"We got 5:15pm dinner reservations on Valentine's Day since we figured it would get busy (which it did) and we got to sit in one of their cool wheel tables. Dont know what to call them but they look neat. They have a large bar, with flat screens showing the game and on the opposite side large painting of different animal: grizzly bear, fish, birds etc. Has a cool industrial meets vintage feel so I was lovely it. 

So...the food...first of we started with a ginormous root beer float just cuz and I got blue piont oysters as an appetizer.  Wow, they were fresh,  salty and not one speck of sand. For dinner I got the Mexican Shrimp Volcano that had a lobster claw, a large portion (maybe 6 or 8) of jumbo Tiger shrimp, at least 6 big sprigs of grilled asparagus all strategically placed on very yummy mashed potatoes. It was very good, hearty and had a lot of different elements that blended well together.  

The bright  star of the dinner though was the Lobster Mac and Cheese...holy cow this was amazing.  I know because my husband made the mistake of giving me a bite and I of course had to have more (thank God for the large portion they give you).  The pasta,  cheese sauce...wow the cheese sauce was so good I am getting hungry just thinking about it. Not only were the bare bones of the dish hands down great but there was a surprising amount of lobster in it. My husband had to continuously get his knife so he could cut the large portions of lobster he was finding... not common for most places who attempt this dish. The Lobster Mac and Cheese here by far is one of the top favorite dishes I have ever eaten - absolutely spectacular.  

The whole experience was such a treat - this restaurant has it all. Great decor, awesome food, helpful staff  and our server Davin knew all the ins and outs of the menu. We even got to chat a bit with Luke himself and were surprised to find out he used to be a street foods vendor.  Pretty cool. 

Again going down to this restaurant was a complete treat. We felt welcome from beginning to end and we will definitely be back. Highly recommended this establishment and if you want great service ask for Davin."}
{"text":"Friday after New Years Day...Wanted to show relatives a good seafood restaurant...
Luke Wholeys turned out to be a disappointment and high priced.  My wife ordered a famous bloody mary...It was watery and weak, the bartender made her another one, however, it was like red covered glass of horseradish.  As for food, my wife and I ordered a fish and chips platter that included fries, cole slaw fish 2 scallops and 4 shrimp, all fried.  Fish was good, scallops fair and shrimp average...the fries were cool and wimpy, and we were charged 23.00 then (3.00 extra for sharing which was not explained beforehand.}
Service not great, no offers after telling our server of our dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"In the winter pretty cold sitting by the garage door - like window.  The fish ordered was very good but the \"chips\" were a soggy mass of unsalted french fries.  NO salt on the table and when arrived with a miniscule shaker.  No salad, cole slaw or any other side came with it..... and the waitress stated she did not know what came with it.   Is this a dinner entree ?  Cost was 14.95 I enviously glanced at my date's meat linguini ( he reported it was the best on the menu) but ended up hungry after a tiny side of paper thin zucchini and 4 shrimp appetizer. ($11) I went to another restaurant for dessert due to the limited dessert menu and frustration with the choices.
The discount coupon saved the evening otherwise it would have been upsetting.

Will give it another try for a sandwich in the summer, may be a much better option, when I can sit outside."}
{"text":"Wife and I went to Luke Wholey's the other night for dinner.
We saw all the great reviews and decided to give it a shot.
The place is pretty big in size and was mobbed.
We were seated immediately which was a good sign.
Waiter brought over water and menus immediately and then came back for drink orders.
I had the broiled cod with french fries and a french onion soup.
The soup was pretty good, but my complaint with it was that it was almost all cheese and very little soup????.
The cod was ok nothing to write home about.
The service was excellent and the waiter was very friendly.
The service was a bit slow, but that was properly do to it being mobbed.
I would properly go again if it was less crowded and I would try something else."}
{"text":"Met Robert Wholey...wholey sweet talker :) 

Started with the highly recommended Lobster Bisque Fries (complimentary with a Yelp check in!) and a couple chocolate crème stouts. The fries? My new favorite way to eat them. Move over truffle fries, lobster bisque is the way to go. 

I had the blue crab salad, while my bf's mom ordered the shrimp and scallops. Salad had a ton of crab...def couldn't finish. Bf's mom's order was delivered with sweet soy instead of lobster beurre blanc, and quickly corrected. 

All in all, a super cute place in the heart of the Strip District with good food. Win."}
{"text":"First time eating here last night (after hearing many good reviews from friends). I had the surf and turf along with the lobster bisque (massive pieces of lobster) and it was by FAR the best I've had in the city to date!! I also had their twist on an old fashion that was mixed up by an extremely friendly/pleasant bartender Ryan.....again....amazing.....even better than my previous favorite at Butcher and the Rye. He also made a really great gin martini of some sort for my wife that she raved about.

Can't wait to come back!!

P.S. Was blown away that they were able to fit us in at 6:30 on a Saturday night, the restaurant was very busy but it's a big enough space that there were still a few available tables, so definitely keep this place in mind if you're in town to see a show or other event on the weekend! Everyone from the hostess I spoke to when making the reservation, to  our waiter Brian (super funny), and as previously mentioned, their bartender were soooo welcoming! The only other restaurant that I've had that vibe from is the Hartwood Restaurant in Fox Chapel.

A++++"}
{"text":"I went to dinner the other evening with my husband and daughter and our dogs!
We wanted to eat outside somewhere that excepted dogs, it was a beautiful evening!
When we called Luke's to see if we were allowed to dine with dogs outside he said, of course that would be fine. There were no tables opened at the time so his said, come in an hour.   When we got there they were so nice to us while we were waiting for the table to open up, they offered us something to drink and water for the dogs.  The people at our table were enjoying the evening and didn't look like they were going to leave soon, so they were kind enough to drag another table outside for us!  
The service was excellent, and the food was great too!  The staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! My complaints are with the front of the house. All the front staff were nice and upbeat, but their clearly scattered a little too much. Went in for brunch and they didn't have any coffee brewed. It took 20 minutes to get some going. Also, they couldn't find the salt shakers for the tables. What kinda place can't find a salt shaker? Overall, food was an A+, but service gets a C. Go here for good food, but just don't expect too much from the wait staff."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon, wandering around the Strip.  Luke Wholey's was calling my name.  We decided to stop for lunch.  We were happy to see that they had a table for us on the sidewalk.  

Our server Troy was great.  He helped me select a sandwich, I ordered the crab cake.  BJ ordered blacken scallops and shrimp with jasmine rice.  My sandwich wasn't jumbo lump, but it was very good and I love their french fries.  BJ's seafood was perfectly cooked.  It was served with baby bok choy which was also yummy.

We really enjoyed our first experience here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had an out of town Marine Vet with me.  We had started out at a restaurant down the street where our server seemed to have forgotten about us.  Our experience at Luke's was completely different.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  Our server was very pleasant and professional. He took time to answer questions we had about menu items and made recommendations.  I had the crab stuffed salmon.  It was amazing, perfectly seasoned!  It came with sauteed kale and fingerling potatoes.  The kale was fresh and tender. My friend enjoyed his meal also.  I will definitely return to Luke's Alaskan Grille and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place but the annoying Gerry guy bugs the shit out of you.. Wants to explain the menu like you're retarded! I'd rather go somewhere else and not be annoyed I feel like I was forced into buying food?"}
{"text":"Hands down the best piece of seafood you can get for lunch...or probably any other meal for the price. Sure the price reflects market cost for fish, but when you compare the quality to other middle to high end places...the cost is still substantially less and affordable. Expertly cooked and paired with dishes, I've yet to have anything Luke has prepared that I haven't absolutlely loved. One of the best new restaurants in Pittsburgh with a very bright future."}
{"text":"Who ever thought as a native Floridian that one of the best broiled fish sandwiches I've ever enjoyed would be in Pittsburgh? I sure didn't but that was certainly the case here.

They serve a very large portion of fresh cod with Parmesan cheese, onion, lettuce, and tomato on fresh bread. This sandwich is a must try and comes with pretty good fries.

The service was a little slow but that was okay since we were there with friends.

I really enjoyed this place and will be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"The wait staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. The portion sizes were generous. We had to wait a while but it was so worth it!"}
{"text":"I found this place because the seafood place down the street wouldn't seat me.   I'm so glad they didn't.   I'm not from Pittsburgh, and I don't really know my way around.   I have been to Wholey's market, though,  so when I saw the restaurant name, I knew I was in for a treat. The food here is excellent,  as you would expect from a Wholey.  The service is even better.   I love the atmosphere,  appropriate for the Strip District.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  Me and the hubby stopped after going to the car show Saturday afternoon.  We both got appetizers.  I got the lobster bisque french fries.  Who would have thought this combo works?  It was absolutely delicious!  The hubby got the lobster bisque and liked it very much!  There was no shortage of lobster in the bisque.  There were HUGE chunks of it!  The apps were devine!  I had the seared Ahi Tuna with Jasmine rice and aspargus for my main course.  It was cooked to perfection, not overdone.  The Jasmine rice had excellent flavor.  The hubby got the fried catfish sandwich with fries and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was big and he said as far as fried catfish, it was some of the best he's had.  The service was great, even though according to our waitress they were short staffed.  The place itself has a very cool vibe.  We will most certainly go back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome place ... Amazing food. I recently moved to Pittsburgh and this was my first dining experience here - I WAS NOT
DISAPPOINTED. I had the fried fish sandwich (added avocado) with fries. So good ... I could only eat half. I will definitely be back ... Helpfully soon!"}
{"text":"Luke Wholey's almost goes unnoticed with all that to be seen at The Strip, but am I ever glad that we decided to sit down for lunch last Saturday afternoon. 

I'll say this, it was no cheap affair, three people each getting meals and drinks landed just under $100, but it was absolutely worth it. Service was also great, despite it being a rather busy day.

I had the blackened ahi tuna sandwich and a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary was one of the best I've ever had, with a pickle and shrimp to boot, and the tuna was cooked perfectly.

That atmosphere and location are ideal, and the food and drink this time around we're very impressive. The only negative I have is based on pricing, $10+ for a Bloody Mary is excessive, and the seafood and sushi is definitely priced at the premium. 

If you're willing to make an investment for a great meal, I highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food wasn't that great. Went during restaurant week and had the wild Alaskan salmon and it wasn't  good at all. The bar tender is so sweet that served me and that's why it's a 3. The manager not so savory"}
{"text":"i know this is late, sorry! this place is now my favorite sushi spot! we went for restaurant week. everytime we go somewhere for restaurant week however, we end up ordering off the regular menu! this time was no different!
tom got the lobster bisque & i had the seared ahi tuna. his bisque had so much meat in it, including a whole piece of claw! he's enjoyed it each time we've been. my ahi tuna, was SPECTACULAR!!! my normal sushi spot has a similar dish, but this puts it shame! it is that good!!!
we shared 3 rolls-the wild alaskan, the tiger shrimp & the captain crunch. each 1 was better than the 1 before,  &  they were all  de-lish-ous! 
when it came time for dessert, we did the only thing we could-order another seared ahi tuna!!! did I say how much we liked it? or how SPECTACULAR it was? YUMMY!!!
i would say they need just a few more wine choices, red since that's what we drink! (haha!) what they had was good, but a  few more would be nice. 
the atmosphere is kitschy & loud, but, it is so worth going to, you don't mind so much! put on your stretchy pants & be prepared to eat amazing food!"}
{"text":"An absolute must if you're in Pittsburgh. The only place around to sell Alaskan King Crab  Legs. If you've seen Deadliest catch, the crabs are from one of the fishermen in the show. They have the best customer service and the friendliest staff. This is by far the best restaurant in the 412. BTW, you have to have dessert."}
{"text":"Watching hockey,guy from outside comes in asks to change tv station, staff doesn't ask anyone at the bar if they're watching and changes the station. ( to drag racing none the less) The same guy then goes back outside . Really !!!!  Really need to learn how to make margaritas esp. in summer !!  Customers had to ask for service, place needs a good rocket under the service staff feels like guests are imposing on them.  Won't be back will find sushi somewhere else. Just remember not everyone who enters your restaurant is a tourist, do it right or don't do it !!"}
{"text":"I love seafood so I was excited to come here! We were invited by my gf from college for a double date. I had the fish and chips, cup of lobster bisque and my boyfriend had the seafood volcano thing. We also split the fried shrimp with scampi flavor on top which was my favorite! The lobster bisque was thick and amazing. Everything was great just very pricey! We also got a few drinks at the bar which were tasty of course. The environment was easy going, staff went above and beyond for everything. I would definitely come back here and recommend to all!"}
{"text":"We made reservations to come here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Looking on their website (Which was down for maintenance) and on the Yelp site we couldn't find any brunch menus.  Only lunch.  We just figured they probably have a brunch menu special that changes week to week.  

 We parked at a lot nearby and walked in.  Our table was ready and it was busy in there.  There was a festival going on near by so a lot of people were around in the Strip.  We sat down and our waitress gave us their menus and she went over verbally their brunch menu for the day.  I was almost set with going with one of their fish sandwiches but she described a French toast with ice cream that seemed delicious but just too sweet for me at this time of the day.  The other option I liked was Chorizo tacos and I added a side of fries because I was hungry.  My wife was in between a few choices too like their Lobster Roll or the Salmon scrambled eggs. She went with the Salmon.  She did order a Bloody Mary to go with her brunch too.  I just had water.

 Our food came out within 15 minutes and it all looked good.  My tacos were really tasty.  I received 2 tacos and I could have eaten three.  That's why I ordered a side of fries.  The fries were disappointing.  I know this is a fish place but I still expected decent fries.  My fries were not seasoned, they just came out plain and they were $4.  I didn't like that.  I put S&P on them to make them better but they weren't worth $4.  My wife liked her Salmon and eggs. I think she really would have preferred the Lobster Roll but she let me eat some of her eggs and they were really good.  I actually liked it better than my tacos.

 We liked this place and would visit here again to try out their lunch and entrée menu's.  The atmospheres good and the people were friendly.  My only complaint was those $4 plain fries!"}
{"text":"My son and I met here for lunch. He had a coupon from the Enjoy book which entitles you to $12.00 off a second entree or sandwich.  I liked the atmosphere along with a small aquarium they have towards the back.

My son chose the salmon entree blackened with a side of rice and broccoli. I went with the crabcake sandwich. Normally sandwiches come with French fries but for a slight upcharge you can have a salad. I opted for that since it was a hot day. We got our food fairly quickly. I had a nice size side salad which was very good. My crabcake sandwich had real crabmeat in it and I was blown away by it. So good and so filling. My son enjoyed the blackened salmon which was prepared to his liking.

This is one restaurant which will automatically add 18% tip to your bill. I have heard these tips are popping up on checks in some restaurants in Pittsburgh.

Very good lunch and very good service to boot. Located across from Mon Aimme Chocolat in the Strip District."}
{"text":"We had to stop when we saw their Bloody Mary topped with soft shell crab, shrimp, and bacon! It's nice because you can build it however you want so you don't have to get certain toppings if you don't want them. Their standard Bloody Mary is $11 and then +$2 for shrimp and +$11 for soft shell crab. Then you can add different spice levels for +$1. I chose the medium spice level which was a perfect spicy taste but didn't give me a burning cough. These bloody Mary's are awesome and the add one are well worth it!"}
{"text":"Went here for some drinks, including the well-advertised Bloody Mary. The BM was very strong but not the best tasting. Also ordered some apps including edemame and seaweed salad. Unfortunately, the edamame was waaaay over salted. I would give this place another try for dinner."}
{"text":"So I had the same experience both times I came into this place. You walk in and it's kind of a cluster. The same hostesses seems stressed which is maybe due to the un organization but she's barely pleasant. Both times waiting for a someone to come to our table to get drinks and has resulted in a switched server. The first time our server told us our original server was too stressed to take our table on and the second time he barely paid attention to us leading my dad to just go right to the bar we were sitting by and order our drinks after waiting 20 with no offer. Then causing our server to change again. But once things get going it has turned out to be pretty good. Both times we have been here the food was delicious and fresh. The cod sandwiches are so huge you could share it with someone. Last time we ordered the lobster bisque fries as an appetizer and that was a stand out, so good! My dad said the mussels were equally as good. If it weren't for the rocky service here, it'd be a four. So if you go have some patience especially if you're hungry/thirsty! I think two visits were enough for me."}
{"text":"We have been in going to the strip for most of the last decade after relocating to Pittsburgh.  We enjoyed many food haunts over the years and eyed with a little skepticism Luke's new restaurant when it opened a few years ago.  The fish wholesalers taking a gamble at a restaurant?  We gave it a shot and loved it...6 visits ago!  Our latest visit was this past Saturday.  We returned hoping to find the upscale casual comfort we found before and were served that from the moment we walked in the door.  The staff made us feel very welcome with witty banter and quick service.  The whole restaurant smacked of enjoyment as we witnessed most tables full of folks enjoying beers, wine and some of their meal in a glass bloody marys.  Mind you, this was only 12:30pm!  This place has a way of making you want to enjoy MORE.  We went with iced tea and sodas as we had our daughters in tow.  Sweet tea was not on the menu but our excellent server Brian took the unsweet and delivered it with a little simple sugar to my wife to make it so.  The bisque was excellent and paired well with a side salad with lemon vinaigrette.  Enough of that starter stuff... The crab cake was very good.  If you know what a good one is supposed to be like, I don't need to explain further. In fact, I wont.  We also enjoyed the salmon club special along with our daughter ordering her regular favorite, the shrimp po'boy buffalo style and the other a salmon club special.   Note:  when ordering avocado, you get most of an avocado. Yep.  Something finally worth the up-charge in the restaurant world.  Look, the food was very enjoyable. The only thing better was the service.  Excellent and unimposing service.  While it has been a few months since we have been here, our last trip will make this destination a certain stop on our Strip District railway journey again sometime soon!  Well done Luke and the team!"}
{"text":"First time here on a Wednesday night. Nice crowd and very friendly staff. We ordered crab legs, lobster bisque, scallops and shrimp all excellent! We will definitely be back! We had a terrific meal and couldn't have asked for better service!"}
{"text":"Mr. J and I had dinner here with another couple on Friday night. I don't know if it's the location (Penn Avenue in the Strip) or if people haven't warmed up to this place yet, but it was very empty with maybe 2 other tables with partons. 

Our server was very friendly and attentive - almost too much so - perhaps because he didn't have much to do or was distracted by the fact that one of our friends is a tattoo artist as the server felt it necessary to show off his ink. We're easy-going people, so it wasn't that big of a deal. 

The food was good - I enjoyed my seared yellowtail but there were only 2 small pieces and nearly a cup of rice on my plate. So my portions were a bit unbalanced and skimpy for the $23 price tag. Mr. J had the land and sea - while his steak seemed a bit overcooked, the scallops were seared perfectly and were delicious. 

I'm bummed I missed the all-you-can-eat blue crabs that were on special two weekends ago. I think LWWAG could benefit from having things like this more often. I think that's what would get me to go back."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best meals that I have had in a long time.  Amazing Tuscan shrimp scampi with oil, garlic and lemon sauce.  Captain crunch roll was equally as good.  I can't wait to go back and to top it off our waiter, Nick was superb.  Swordfish = out of this world too."}
{"text":"Let me tell you friends, I've been on a MASSIVE seafood kick lately!  It's not just sushi though, it's everything and I want it well prepared and cooked to perfection.  So you walk into a place with the name \"Wholey\" and you expect it to \"wow\" you.  And you know what?  It did!

I was surprised to see the less than stellar reviews at first, but I had faith it was just the new restaurant jitters.  We came in on a random Tuesday night around 8pm and was surprised to see about 6 other tables full with diners.  Surprising to see in the Strip, but exciting, if you ask me!  

It's an absolutely gorgeous space.  Nothing you would expect from the Strip at this point and time.  It actually used to be a club, so there's many different levels.  I love the sea of blues and mosaic tiles.  The tables are large, so it's great for big parties.  

We started out with the Sashimi appetizer and it was so cold and fresh.  I loved the tiny mandarin oranges and crisp lettuce surrounding it.  We devoured it within 3 seconds of it hitting the table.  Good start!

The tomato salad will probably only be on the menu for a short time, considering the season for them ends soon, but it's worth having when you can.  You can easily throw together some tomatoes and splash on some balsamic.  This had a very well done pesto sauce and pine nuts.  I would have never thought of the combo together, but I loved it!  

I ordered the Scallops and Shrimp, which came with a hearty helping of jasmine rice and grilled bok choy.  Both the Scallops and Shrimp were seared to perfection and the scallops, which I find hard to season well, had a great flavor and were large in size.  I loved the creamy garlic sauce drizzled on top.  It was as if every element of the dish came together in harmony!  


While seafood can be expensive, and this was no exception for a $24 meal, I had no qualms about paying my bill for the amount of flavor that was packed into each dish.  Fresh is the word here and you won't have to reel me in... I'm coming on my own!"}
{"text":"Went to Luke's for lunch with some co-workers.  Too expensive to go regularly, but for a treat, it was a great choice.  They were serving 3 different kinds of oysters, and I got one of each.  A variety from Canada called Raspberry Point was expecially tasty.  For my meal, I got the sockeye salmon with crab meat.  Superb.  I appreciated the quality of fish.  Others at the table ordered the lobster fries and the tuna entree.  The only negative I heard was that the tuna portions could have been bigger.  

I usually don't give 5 stars, but I tried to think of something that could have made the meal better, and I couldn't come up with anything.  So 5 stars it is!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Luke Wholey's multiple times and it has never disappointed. I can honestly say this is one of - if not the - favorite restaurant of mine. It's not too pricey for lunch and the sweet soy seafood trio is one of the best foods I have ever eaten. I don't prefer rice and get it over salad instead but when we came here on Valentine's day and i got the rice - which i love because the sauce is just so amazing! The portions are incredibly generous. One day me and my boyfriend came here and got the shrimp volcano to share. Even after splitting it we had leftovers! The lobster bisque fries are insane. I've never had anything bad here. The worst thing that's ever happened is our server forgot to give us chocolate covered strawberries on Valentine's day. Big whoop! The food and atmosphere make up for that ten fold! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Must go for lunch and dinner. I had salmon bisque soup that was fantastic! Then followed up with 1/2 dozen oysters in a half shell! Stellar! Then I had the Steel City Lobster Roll .... Taste great till I found a rubber band from the produce in my sandwich. The owner Luke came out with a new sandwich and apologized. He offered me a drink/dessert as well as no charge for the sandwich. Luke is a stand up guy and the restaurant is amazing! Highly recommend and I will be back:-) Thank you Luke and staff!"}
{"text":"Being from the Pacific Northwest, I have fairly high standards for seafood and have not found many places in Pittsburgh that I would consider great (or even \"good\" for that matter). I came here for an event earlier this week and was able to sample a variety of their oysters. If these were any indication of the rest of the food, then I can't wait to come back and try a full meal (- the blue-crab stuffed salmon is first on the list). My favorite was their version of oysters rockefeller, which I could have eaten an entire plate of. We were also given a shucking demonstration, which was super fun - they make it look so easy! Everyone that works there is very passionate about seafood, especially the owner who seems very involved in the daily operations of the restaurant (and is also very cute :)  ). 

The space itself is great - it is decorated well to fit the theme of the restaurant. I will be back soon to try a few more items from the menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and definitely will be returning!!! great Bloody Mary's and sushi :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! I'm here for Sushi Thursday 25% sushi. Yum!
The food is amazing and never disappoints! Luke is great!"}
{"text":"If you walk in and bust a move it's Déjà vu. The old night club/lounge has been transformed into a seafood destination maintaining the high ceilings and exclusive loft. The ambience was inviting and the staff was friendly + attentive despite being understaffed during our visit. The food while fresh was good, just maybe not great (albeit we ate from the Pittsburgh Restaurant Week menu) nor worthy of such a price point. The sushi and soup were strong appetizers; however the lobster/crab ravioli was on the small size with an overly rich cream sauce that congealed on the plate. The halibut was small yet excellent and was paired alongside a root vegetable cake with a sweet citrus glaze. The last bite did leave a lasting sweet impression of rich chocolate mousse though -- dare you to eat just one bite. A second \"normal\" visit from the standard menu has been warranted."}
{"text":"Astonishing this place could have gotten four stars. The welcome as I walked in the door was nonexistent, and the service at best indifferent. The lobster had some rubbery things floating in it. The soup was a darkish brown and had a certain flavor unrelated to lobster. The rice in the California Roll was overlooked and nothing else in the roll had any flavor. So the whole thing was a mouthful of mush. My general impression was of a place that makes money off tourists and so doesn't try very hard for the quality and consistency required to create a noteworthy local restaurant with a loyal clientele"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille - my brother and I took our parents here to celebrate their 50th wedding pre-anniversary celebration.  My parents live in Beaver County and they rarely come to Pittsburgh for anything - in fact my mom is so stubborn that she generally refuses to come but we raved about the delicious Alaskan King Crab Legs and the service so much that my dad was able to convince her to come out here for dinner.  

We arrived and were seated right away (with a reservation) and the garage door-style windows were open which allowed a lot of light and a nice breeze to come in.  We were seated in Drew's section who was trained by the marvelous Kevin (good job training Drew, Kevin) and Drew was just as wonderful and attentive as Kevin has been on our previous visits.  Mr. Wholey (Luke's dad) was also there making the rounds and when they found out that it was my parents' anniversary and my dad's birthday soon they made sure to throw in dessert.  

For appetizers we ordered the catfish bites and the peel and eat shrimp, plus my dad got the lobster bisque.  The peel and eat shrimp was seasoned with Old Bay and came with a tangy cocktail sauce that had a little bit of a kick.  The catfish bites were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and were delicious when paired with the Thai Chili dipping sauce.  They had frozen margaritas and frozen mojitos as their drink specials and Drew was kind enough to bring small samples so that we could decide - both were delicious!  If they are ever on the bar menu when you go they are both definitely worth the indulgence and especially refreshing on a hot day.  For our entrees we ordered 3 orders of the Alaskan King Crab Legs along with an order of the swordfish steak stuffed with crab.  Everything was delicious.  The crab is so sweet and tender that you do not even need to dip it in butter - in fact the butter almost detracts from the rich flavor of the crab meat.  My parents shared the swordfish and an order of the crab legs and we all had enough to take home for leftovers.  After dinner they brought us over a huge piece of cheesecake that we shared between the four of us.  Drew was incredibly kind, conscientious, and attentive.  One of the best parts of going to Luke's is the outstanding service!   Treat your servers well and they will take very good care of you!  My dad who is going to 88 said that it was one of the best meals he has ever had!

I have already suggested Luke's for my office Christmas party this year and I will continue to recommend this restaurant.  They have the freshest seafood available in Pittsburgh in a relaxed atmosphere and the service is heads above most other restaurants that I've been to not just in Pittsburgh but in the whole U.S., which is key to getting customers to return.  I will always think twice before returning to an establishment where I've gotten bad service, even if the food is good (See my review of Carmi's).  So, go to Luke Wholey's soon!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This review has mostly to do with the service, not the food. 

My husband called ahead for reservations for six on a Saturday night, and he informed the restaurant that his father was in a wheelchair, and would need to be accommodated. They said it would be fine. 

When we arrived, they had planned for six, but not for the wheelchair. The majority of their restaurant is comprised tables with wide bases, which would prohibit my father-in-law from reaching the table. The tables that would have worked were occupied, but we said we would wait. As soon as those tables were available, the staff was quick to prep them for us to be seated. 

Our server. Maybe just an off day? He couldn't seem to remember much. We asked him to stop filling a water glass for my FIL (for health reasons), but he needed to be reminded. Then, I asked for a club soda, and he forgot about that. My sister-in-law asked about the preparation of the crab legs, and he said he would check on that-  nope. Forgot. Then I asked for extra ginger and he'd forgotten. Then I asked the manager, who brought my husband's dinner later than the rest of ours, and he brought it within minutes. 
AND I presented the Yelp coupon when we ordered the appetizer, and HE FORGOT TO TAKE IT OFF THE CHECK!
This may all have been just a slight annoyance if the servers weren't gathered at the bar talking for long periods of time during our meal. 

The food: ok  
Lobster bisque fries
Pretty sure this could have been labeled gravy fries, and no one would know the difference. 

Sushi: pretty good!

Grilled Georges Bank Swordfish dinner
The potatoes weren't cooked completely, so they were that hardened, grainy texture. The fish was good. 

My in laws were impressed by the lobster tail and asparagus. 

I don't think I'll be returning, as poor service is one of the biggest turn offs for me. The music is too loud for normal conversation as well."}
{"text":"They served my girlfriend mussels that hadn't been cleaned. They were sandy and still had their beards attached. There were also plenty off closed and cracked shells. It tasted looked a lot like he first time I bought mussels at a supermarket and cooked them for myself; NOT as you would expect at a seafood restaurant. 

I got tuna, which was better but still not great. I also ordered a Bloody Mary, which took 15+ minutes to arrive. The drink was good but had far too many garnishes.

 I won't be returning. I don't understand where this place's good reviews come from...."}
{"text":"So I tried this place out this past weekend. 

The host greeted us,  not the most friendly older gentleman who told us while pointing where to sit & apparently couldn't walk us to our table nor hand is menus.
We waited patiently for a server to come to our table. Server finally came,  my friend & I ordered 2 cosmopolitans. When we got our drinks ...we took a sip of our drinks. .. looked at each other & knew we couldn't drink these drinks. .. just awful tasting. Can't even tell you what was wrong because they tasted just rotten.
Ordered an appetizer & asked if we could have new drinks. .. wine instead as we figured that'd be safer. Server was quick to say sure & scampered off to the bar. .. we then watched as our server mocked us to the bartender ... we know this because we could SEE her & could hear it. Lucky for us no spit. Lol. Comes back, we have our wine.  Appetizer came shortly afterwards. The food was great. I love peel ' n eat shrimp, these were fabulous. 
All in all food good, customer service shitty. I'll give it another try as I hope for a better experience. ...if not better on round 2, you'll hear about it."}
{"text":"This place makes the prettiest bloody marys i have ever seen. You can get the regular one, but who wants to be regular? You want to get the add-ons - like bacon and shrimp. The actual drink itself wasn't amazing - could have used more alcohol. But the presentation overall (we saw a couple drinking it outside) was enough to get rope us in.

Tip - check in on Yelp and you can get a free appetizer with any menu item order. Since we had already eaten, we didn't really want appetizers, except maybe some oysters. The waiter was nice enough to let us use the Yelp offer as $12 off the bill. The oysters were tiny and not completely shucked clean - but hey at $12 off, how can I complain?"}
{"text":"I ate the Baja Shrimp, which were delicious. The portion size was just right for lunch. Our server was also very helpful, but not pushy."}
