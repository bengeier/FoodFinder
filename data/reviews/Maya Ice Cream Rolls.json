{"text":"This place is small but packs a mighty good little menu. I came in last Saturday tried the chicken curry and rice so so good. I had to bring my husband in this evening to try and they were serving chicken butter curry  it's the best Indian food I have ever had. On top of the good food they serve ice cream rolls we had the monkey business and it was delish! The owners are so generous and kind. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great ice cream and great flavors! Love this place been here many times. Menu is full of great option to pick from and they will mix up the ice cream for you!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on Sunday. This is our second time here the first time was good this time however was awful. I spent over $20 on 3 orders not one of them was what we ordered. All 3 came out at different times. The first order came out after about 15 minutes. The other 2 took another 15 minutes each by this time my son and girlfriend had already eaten and I was still waiting on my order. I finally had, had enough waiting. I asked for my money back I was told oh here's yours and was just given the one they were making at the time again not what I ordered. I get it it's a new place and busy at times but this was ridiculous. Very disappointing I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. What a unique treat, made to order ice cream with incredible combinations and flavors. The owner and staff are very friendly. Definetly my new ice cream spot. One more thing. The Indian food that is served on the weekends is to die for. Do yourself a favor and try it."}
{"text":"Delicious little ice cream spot! Super friendly and helpful staff. Unique ice cream style, worth trying definitely."}
{"text":"This place is hidden inside the mall, but well worth the trip? The fruit is fresh and ice cream is creamy! I definitely recommend this over regular ice cream"}
{"text":"We tried it because i've seen all the cool pics of them making it and we are hooked!!! So delicious and fresh. Lots of different options to make a tasty cold treat. Plus they are so friendly here! New fave sweet spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The ice cream was delicious and inexpensive. The portion sizes were perfect and the choices given were diverse. The place was really clean, and the service was great. Super friendly and comforting. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had chikoo flavored roll ice cream... it took me back to my homeland.... a nice place to try something new and tasty.   The crew is friendly and helpful....way to go...."}
{"text":"Quality Ice cream, fresh ingredients, good customer service! Recipe for me coming back!!! I'll write another review when I get time to try the Indian Food"}
{"text":"Delicious! Surprisingly the rolled ice cream was not icy. The concept is interesting. The owner of the store was very friendly and helped us with making our decision. The store lacked aesthetics, but they just opened so I assume over time it will look amazing!"}
{"text":"Low on staff. Be ready to wait for half an hour minimum. The evening we went everyone was there for ice cream rolls. Most of them are ready to wait for the unique customized ice cream rolls."}
{"text":"Not fancy but food is great. We both ordered the chicken curry combo and shared the ice cream rolls. So good. Came with rice, veggies and naan bread. Flavor was perfect. They do groups and parties too. We will be bringing back family and friends to eat here. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food and dessert! I love this place! I can't wait to go back! I got the butter chicken combo, and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here, and definitely won't be the last! All personnel working were friendly and courteous. We tried the Oreo - Rocher Love and it was to die for! Not overly sweet but just the right amount of sweetness!"}
{"text":"Location: lower level of food court area hallway. Across from AMC theater.   Wow. I went in for ice cream and ended up eating some really great butter curry chicken, rice, naan, lentils combo     The staff is really friendly, the owner recognizes us each time we go and stops by to check in an sat hello. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Come here for the ice cream.  It's worth the experience.  The food is ok.  When we went, there were not a lot of choices.  It was pretty much, \"This is what we made today and that's what goes on your dinner plate.\"  It wasn't bad though but as my kindergartner would put it, \"You get what you get and  you don't throw a fit.\"  But the ice cream, oh my god the ice cream.  First you pick your base which is basically going to be your ice cream flavor.  Then you pick the stuff you want in the ice cream and then the toppings.  The base is poured on top of a metal counter that's super cold (-30 degrees+).  It gets chopped and tossed around with the ingredients (cookie, fruit or whatever you choose to go into your roll).  Eventually, the base turns solid, flattened and squared, cut and rolled and voila, you've got your rolled ice cream!!  The process is really neat to watch but the flavor is even better to eat!!  It tastes really cream but not as sweet as the ice cream you get in the store (but still pretty sweet).  I definitely want to bring my kids here next time so they can experience it.  The owner was really nice, too.  Give it a try and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best ice cream in all of Phoenix! Fresh hand made ice cream is amazing. I had their berry one and let me tell you fresh berries in fresh ice cream is an absolutely amazing combination. It's also fun watching it being made before your eyes. I'm so excited to go back and try the other flavors and their hot food. Also the people who own it are amazing! So friendly and welcoming they definitely make you want to come back besides the allure of amazing fresh made ice cream."}
{"text":"We were out on a search to find a different style ice cream place, and these ice cream rolls hit the spot! I got the berry extraordinary and it was pretty bomb."}
{"text":"You can get Indian food and/or ice cream rolls. The chicken curry and rice was awesome. The rolled ice was so cool to watch them make! You can choose from so many different flavors and toppings for your ice cream too, it was hard to make up my mind! They were super friendly and everything was great! It's right next to the movie theater and it's a perfect place for dinner and a movie or just ice cream rolls after a movie! We will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty.  Had the almond base with Nutella, strawberries and banana with coconut, cherry and condensed milk topping.  Definitely recommend.  New favorite local ice cream place.  Look forward to trying their daily Indian lunch/dinner menu.  Makes trips to the mall worth it."}
{"text":"The rolls were an excellent concept to ice cream that I had never tried before. You choose the ice cream flavor for the roll, the stuff you want mixed in before they roll it, and the toppings and syrup you want after. You can go with you gut and choose your own assortment, or go with some menu suggestions that are excellent flavor combos. I had a vanilla roll with snickers, crackers, and Lindt truffle mixed in, topped with raspberries, chocolate chips, and chocolate syrup. It was REALLY good! They also serve really good Indian food if you're looking for a meal with your dessert."}
{"text":"Great place! Sing was exceptional with her customer service and explained how it works. My kids absolutely loved the ice cream ! We will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Great concept of ice cream rolls. Delicious. And their Indian food is amazing as well. Very friendly people. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Expensive ice cream rolls! Thought it would taste different then I excepted it to be. Definitely recommend it if you like a lot of stuff in your ice cream.  Felt like there was too much stuff in it. I just wanted something simple.   They give you a piece of paper to write what you would like. They will make what you wrote.   So you pick your 1st base, 2nd select your roll(you will taste this the most), 3rd select toppings (this goes on top of the rolls) 2 max then 50 cents extra for more, & 4th select syrup (this goes on top of the rolls).  I choose vanilla for the base, coco loco for the roll, chocolate chips & white chocolate chips as toppings & no sauce. Wish it didn't have cookies in it.   There's 2 sizes to choose from. You can make your ice cream as well.   It was cool watching them make the rolls.   Theres a Groupon deal were you get 15% cash back when you use your card. Claim the deal!"}
{"text":"I don't make many trips to the mall but with Maya attached to the outside, I have a feeling I might be making more appearances at Arrowhead Mall. I've been looking forward to trying this rolled ice cream. First you pick your base. I chose Chocolate. Then you chose your \"roll\" I  went for the Tooty Fruity: Strawberry, Strawberry Wafer, and Fruity Pebbles. Then you get 2 toppings. I got frosted flakes to stick to my cereal theme, and coconut. And lastly your syrup. Condensed Milk for me. I was so excited to eat my ice cream that when I got up after eating as much as this delicious treat my stomach could handle, I entirely forgot to pay. As I was telling the owner how much I loved it, he kindly reminded me.   I recommend giving this place a try. It would be fun for the kids to get to chose exactally how they want their ice cream and then they get to watch it be made from scratch. I don't see how you could go wrong.   The staff was friendly and the establishment was kept clean and simple with its design. I'm excited to come back and try more combos!"}
{"text":"The ice cream was delicious. I had the monkey business and would recommend it to anyone who loves Nutella and bananas. It's made right in front of you and takes a little time so make sure you're not in a rush. Family owned business, very friendly people who seem to really love what they do."}
{"text":"Very tasty and good yummy choices. It's nice that you can make your own variation of rolls."}
{"text":"I believe I got myself overhyped for this. I was in the mood for good ice cream. I saw the reviews of this place and thought how cool it was going to be.   If there are any amount of people there it will take a long time. I got the monkey one with Nutella. Where was it?? You'd expect if the first ingredient listed was Nutella there would at least be some amount. Nope. The ice cream wasn't that spectacular. I've had better store bought ice cream.  I believe people just like to see something different. It was interesting to see the people making it but that's about it. Wish I could of spent the money elsewhere. Live and learn."}
{"text":"They serve Ice cream roles in lots of flavors. They also have a small indian food menu. I tried the Mango Strawberry ice cream roll which was pretty good. They have a nice seating area inside Arrowhead mall with a patio."}
{"text":"Loved the ice cream rolls, really liked the Indian food. Only minor drawback: very limited Indian food selection, but we enjoyed it.   The people working there were very friendly and helpful.  We stopped in right after a movie and there was no one there. After we ate, we have the ice cream rolls. There were four of us. They make them one at a time and the process is complicated in a bit slow.  Later, a rush of people came in and it began to bog down a bit. I could see how if you get here at a very busy time it might take quite a while to get your ice cream."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff! The menu is very minimal for food, but it was very tasty. Initially didn't intend to try an ice cream roll, but they brought us samples while we were eating dinner, and after trying it we had to order some for dessert. Definitely worth going back for again!"}
{"text":"I could have not been more excited when I heard about this place! The ice cream was very good. The 2 stars are strictly due to how I was treated. I felt bad for the guy because he told us that his co-worker didn't show up for work so he was alone. So I tipped him extremely well and said, \"No worries, I understand.\" I did not think he was going to take advantage of that and take care of every group that came AFTER my friends and I. And I say group because these were families that came in. I didn't say anything because I was trying to be nice and thought I would probably be next. My friends finally got their ice cream and when did I get mine? Almost AN HOUR later! What did this employee say? I didn't see the order. Really? Because HE grouped our orders together since we paid together. It was so unorganized. Get it together and find a system that works so people are served IN ORDER! I'd rather drive an hour away to Scottsdale and get this from a different company."}
{"text":"Very great ice cream rolls! Very good service as well, I recommend it to anyone trying new things! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Maya serves Thai Style Stuffed and Dressed Ice Cream Rolls and a small four item menu of Indian Food. The Ice cream is all natural, high quality and fresh made in front of your eyes on a sheet that freezes the cream. You pick your ice cream base then the toppings you pick get hand chopped into the ice cream a sauce get rolled in and your ice cream rolls get toppings and whipped cream.   I had an all fruit Ice Cream Rolls and My Husband had an all chocolate creation. Both were excellent!   Maya is located in Arrowhead TowneCenter on the first floor across from AMC Movies. You can enter from the outside of the building.   I didn't try the Indian Food but the ice cream is Excellent! The Man working there is friendly and helpful. The place is nicely decorated and there is an outside patio.  The only downside is that it is a very long and slow process making the fresh ice cream to order. Once you receive the ice cream the wait will seem worth it.  It's really cool and fun for kids of all ages."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Went on an impulse lunch with my boyfriend and was impressed with the sample size and the food quality. Right by the back entrance, the guy serving us was pretty chill. If I'm in the area I'll come back."}
{"text":"So I had seen a video of ice cream that was made like this on Facebook but it was somewhere in New York. I had asked my aunt if there was something like it here in Az. And this was the place. I had been waiting to try it. I went with my mom and best friend and man was I impressed and pleased beyond measure. I couldn't tell you what I had the two times I came here but the ice cream tastes so good. It's so fun to watch them. I wish I could explain how they do it but it's hard to explain. They roll it themselves on the metal thing with their utensils. You literally follow the directions on the paper, write your name and give it to them and they make it for you. They also have Indian food there for sale as well and man does that taste good too. I had a sample my first time and my stomach was so satisfied. I can't wait to go back and have Indian food with my ice cream. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolute must! They offer both desserts and hot meals. This review is for the ice cream rolls. You are given a variety of choices to customize your dessert including base, toppings, syrup, etc. There are two sizes to pick. I tried the Monkey Business which is essentially what ice cream would taste if Nutella themselves made it, mixed with strawberries, bananas, and of course Nutella. The way they create the dessert in front of you is unique and a good watch too. Try it! So good! Will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Took daughter on a Wednesday night.  One person working so he was slammed.  Orders were backed up.  I counted 10 tickets waiting to be made when I set ours down.  I was willing to wait.  Sat down and noticed that the music had the *n* word and f with b*tches playing loudly.  I was instantly irritated.  It's an ice cream place, not a club.  20 minutes later and a group of cute girls come in, the employee turns the music up louder and starts showing off with his ice cream rolling skills.  Ok, he's young, whatever.  My problem is he leaves to go in back several times and doesn't come back with any supplies in his hands.  What what he doing?  He is not in a hurry to fill his orders and while I see him put on fresh gloves I never see him wash his hands.  He is taking the money and filling the orders and answering the phone.  At the close to 30 minute mark, while he's in the back again, I take our tickets off the counter, throw them away and leave.  If you're going to have a business like this, staff enough help and make the environment appropriate.  No where in our society is it ok to play music with the *n* word let alone blatant sexual remarks degrading women.... except at clubs where that type of music is accepted, for whatever reason."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Maya! The people working there were very inviting and friendly. The ice cream was amazing and unique. I would go back again and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I have been dying to come to this place and I finally made it and I am in heaven!! Who doesn't love ice cream, and who doesn't like rolls?! So put them together and you have rolled ice cream! It was so good. I think they need two people working. Took about 20mins to get the ice cream!"}
{"text":"4.0 for the novelty and 3.0 for the taste. I guess a solid 3.5 for me.  I'd been wanting to try thai ice cream rolls FOREVER. So when I heard that a new place had just opened in the Glendale area, I rushed right over.   Maya has two sections, one with Indian food and one with the ice cream rolls. For the ice cream rolls, you can peruse the menu and pictures then fill out a form stating what you would like in your order. You pick a base, then a flavor, then toppings, etc. I decided to go with a cold brew coffee base with chocolate ice cream, caramel sauce, and frosted flakes. The place was somewhat busy when I went in and it did take a while to get the orders out. Keep in mind that there was one employee there making the ice cream rolls and ringing up the orders. And well, ice cream rolls in general take some time to make. He may have misread my form, but I ended up getting fruity pebbles rather than frosted flakes with my order. By that time, there was an even bigger line and I didn't feel like having it re-made just because one topping was off.   The taste of the roll itself was just so-so for me. I paid roughly $7.00 for the large size and typically, when I pay such a high price, I expect the flavor to be off the charts amazing. My friends felt the same about their roll as well. Service was super friendly which is what ultimately made me give this place a 4.0. It's definitely a one time experience that everyone should try out, but I'm not sure if I'll continue to go to this place for repeat visits."}
{"text":"I didn't even get a chance to order....  First I wasn't greeted but that's ok, I understand that. The problem started when I saw a cell phone near the ingredients in the area where they prepare the ice cream rolls. For my daughter, I stayed. I did notice the young lady had on gloves. But it gets worse. While waiting for her to finish rolling the ice cream \"the phone rings\". SHE PICKED THE PHONE UP WITH THE GLOVES ON AND PUT THE PHONE ON HER EAR WHILE ROLLING ICE CREAM. Absolutely disgusting. Oh and she had a conversation smh. I couldn't stomach that so we left. Hygiene and sanitation is so important when handling food. I'm pretty sure everyone in the world knows that cell phones are the dirtiest things in the world. This was at the Arrowhead Mall location. Maybe the one at Paradise Mall is more aware of germs. I don't recommend this place. Cleanliness is next to godliness right."}
{"text":"So addictive .. me and my kids love to go there again and again . Love the flavours.. tried almost all of them . One of the best ice cream I have ever tried. Highly recommend Maya ice cream rolls..you'll love it too.."}
{"text":"Came across similar shops on the east coast, and was stoked when i heard of this place.  Had a strawberry-berry extraordinary with fruity pebbles, and a vanilla-monkey business;  both were awesome."}
{"text":"We like trying new food so after seeing the reviews decided to try this place... I had protein powder they make into ice cream add your favorite toppings it was great and fun to watch them make it.  Nice place and very nice people, give it a try it's very good and unlike anything you probably have had."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the guy that runs it is very nice and friendly. He even gave my daughter a free sample. The rolled ice cream is very delicious I can't get enough! Can't wait to try the other flavors."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town, and this place came up as a Hot and New business. Their ice cream rolls were the perfect end to my night! I had tried ice cream rolls before but they melted quickly - their rolls maintained their shape and had a good texture to it. I had the Matcha Shock which was nice and creamy. The lady at the counter was also so nice to walk me through the steps of ordering; they were sincere in hoping I'd like their treat. This was a cute stop on my quick weekend visit :)"}
{"text":"Very delicious! I've never had ice cream rolls before and wanted to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. It was soo good. My boyfriend and I showed up15 minutes before they were going to close and we didn't want to be THOSE people but we really wanted to try it. The gentleman who took our order was extremely nice and even offered to let us stay and eat there so we didn't have to rush. I was very appreciative of his kindness. He was talking us through everything and gave great recommendations. It definitely helped make the experience more exciting. Will definitely come back!   It's located where Starbucks used to be at Arrowhead Mall on the first floor under the food court next to the movie theatres. Can't miss it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had tried ice cream rolls in a different state, but these were on a different level of delicious. The owners are super friendly and we will definitely be coming back again. We are obsessed!!!"}
{"text":"Good service, small portion was perfect for what I wanted. I like the variety of the menu as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for the freshly made dessert with fresh fruit.Loved it every piece .loved the taste of the combo Indian meals they had."}
{"text":"The icecream rolls are delicious.. however the food they serve is exceptional as well. They have one daily special, however the owner says if you have a special requests just to give her a 24 hour notice. The naan is okay, but everything else is pretty good. The owners are extremely helpful, polite and courteous. If you want a delicious Indian food meal followed by even tastier dessert, this is a decent place to be at."}
{"text":"My sister was one of their first customers and has raved about the place. Had to pick her up at the mall to night and we stopped to get some rolls to enjoy while watching the music in the square. I had the mango roll with strawberry ice cream, gummy bears, coconut and raspberry sauce. As an ice cream aficionado I definitely enjoyed rhis. Sister had the strawberry shorty with coconut, strawberry and strawberry sauce. Yummy. Worth a stop when at the mall."}
{"text":"The pictures don't do the food justice. We came in for the ice cream but couldn't resist the delicious aroma. We had the daily special \"butter chicken curry, veg kurma, daal lentils with naan\". If you consider yourself a foodie or like to try new food his place is a must!!!! It is  located at arrowhead next to amc, perfect place for a meal before or after a movie."}
{"text":"Rolled ice-cream! After all the pictures I've seen on Instagram, I am so happy it's finally made its way to Arizona, and conveniently, at Arrowhead mall.  Been here twice. Had the fruit combination the first time w/ lychee, strawberry...and the second time, the Oreo Rocher one.  Both amazing! My favorite is definitely the fruit one that had a strong nice lychee flavor.  The family there is amazing! They are excited about their customers coming in and just friendly in general! Will definitely be back! Maybe to try their food? Of course also the dessert afterwards."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome experience, and well worth the wait. It's a great place to take the kids for a new visual experience, and delicious ice cream! 5/5 would recommend to anyone and will return!"}
{"text":"Just because they don't have vegan ice cream base anymore"}
{"text":"In 2016, I wrote a review about ice cream rolls. Back then, the only place they could be obtained in Phoenix was from a mobile cart in an obscure location in El Mirage. I stated that it was only a matter of time before Thai (and apparently non-Thai) restaurants start to market rolls more heavily. And sure enough, here we go!  The concept itself is very interesting and fun to watch. Although, much like my prior experiences, I guess I've always expected the ice cream to take on a different texture or taste due to the elaborate preparation involved. In reality, it really doesn't - even though my girlfriend insists that it is indeed slightly different in texture. Essentially, it's just ice cream with whatever ingredients you want mixed in. That doesn't mean it's not good - because trust me, it most definitely is good!  We ordered a Monkey Business and Kit Kat Latte, but I won't go into details, because you can essentially customize your ice creams anyway you would like. We were both pleased with the quality of what we received.  Maya actually used to be an actual shop, but has since moved to a kiosk on the second floor near where Express is located.   I'd recommend trying them out - because the quality of what they produce is very good - especially in comparison to some of the other \"rolls\" places I've tried.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Me and my sister's came here and we got the following orders. The tutttie fruittie is delish with gummy bears on top . We also got berry extriodinary with white chocolate chips and corn flakes on top yum!!!! I got monkey business with corn flakes and mnms what a combo !! Yes so delish definitely recommend!!!! Go here try it !!"}
{"text":"Amazing creamy ice cream! I had the green tea with matcha, starwberries and condensed milk. Very good."}
{"text":"A great place to buy ice cream.  Everything is made to order and the ice cream is definitely delicious!  My favorite is the Monkey Business.  The staff is very friendly and always accommodating.  You get the best bang for your buck!  I highly recommended checking this place out when your have that ice cream craving!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out while at the mall. From the get go unfortunately I wasn't too impressed. They had one person working with about 5 of us in line. We ordered and watched as he made our dessert. Very cool process. Once we got our ice cream I was really disappointed. It was put together so blah. Marshmallow was barely charred and no real flavor. I'd of rather went to the water and ice store and been happy while also saving a lot of money. Too pricy for the quality we received. Won't come back."}
{"text":"Awesome product! This is a great place to stop if u need a quick sweet fix. Their vast combination options make it easy to find what you want. Tastes wonderful and worth every penny"}
{"text":"The Ice cream wasn't bad. I've never had this so the experience was pretty cool. Not something I would get over a local ice cream shop. Some of the toppings didn't interest me either."}
{"text":"Super creamy and delicious ice cream! The customer service was great as well, very friendly people. Will be stopping by very soon!"}
{"text":"This place has the best food , I got the non-veggie entree and it was so fast and fresh and flavorful I will be back a lot because the service was amazing and they were all so sweet and because the food was the best . Everyone must come here"}
{"text":"I saw all the reviews on yelp and decided to pop by yesterday while I was at the mall! It's a little hidden, but if you're in the mall, it's by the doors heading towards the AMC theaters on the right. The service was great! The owner, I assume, was so nice and walked me through the process on how to pick my ice cream. I picked my base, then my roll (which is the stuff that they smash into your ice cream) and then my toppings and syrup. It was so fun watching the ice cream be made! I was so excited to try it. It didn't disappoint, the ice cream is yummy! But honestly, a little expensive. It was almost $8 for a large. But I'm at the mall, so things are always a little bit more. What can ya do. Overall a fun and delicious place to stop by if you're in the mood for ice cream!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The Indian food is amazing every single time. For those that haven't tried ice cream rolls... You need to stop here and do so! Not like any ice cream you've had before!"}
{"text":"After reading the high reviews and saw that this was a new business, I made sure to make time to visit here.  It definitely did not disappoint!  Hubby ordered the Reese's Delight and I tried the Snicker's Magic (I don't remember their exact names).  Hubby thought the ice cream maker was a little light-handed with the toppings but it was overall excellent.  I thought mine was just perfect.  Hubby is the kind of person that always appreciates extras but I didn't think there was anything wrong with the amount of toppings.  Ice cream is made to order and is so fresh.  Because it is made to order, it does take a few minutes to be created and if there is a line, the wait is multiplied.  We were the only ones there at that time so the wait was not bad.  We both would love to return to try other flavors.    They do have a very small hot food menu but from reading the descriptions, I wasn't sure what was all included.  It looks like all of their food entrees are about $9.  I may try it another time."}
{"text":"We had the Snickers Magic. I've been wanting to try rolled ice cream for quite some time now, so when I realized that it was just the hype, I was sad. It was good...but I think I would've rather had soft serve...don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable, just that I'd rather spend my unhealthy fat for the day to be something I'd fully, 100% enjoy.   We were greeted with a friendly face, however the ice cream makers were pretty indifferent and uninvolved, not that they were not friendly. I would have to admit that it was just a bit uncomfortable. The venue itself felt unfinished...the carts were \"naked,\" if you will...looking pretty unprofessional. But you do what you gotta do I suppose.   I think I'd give ice cream rolls one more try. A new one opened in the PV mall, so I'll probably try that one before I come back to this location. Only cause it's closer. Would definitely suggest giving it a try for yourself!"}
{"text":"First time I tried indian food and ice cream rolls and I loved it! Also, the customer service was great! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of visiting Maya twice so far.... Very impressed! Their service is great! They are very friendly and eager to help you step by step in their delicious making process.  My family and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  I needed to go to Arrowhead Mall to do a little shopping. On my way in, through the main entrance, I noticed a new little spot called Maya. Wondering what it was, I noticed a poster on the window. It is an Indian food restaurant but there was a poster that definitely caught my eye. They had rolled ice cream! I didn't have time for food since I had to grab what I needed and get back to class but I definitely made time for some ice cream. Walking in, I'm unsure of what his name is but I spoke with the owner and he is extra friendly and personable, and provided great service. So first, you need to select your base ice cream, I selected vanilla. Next you select your roll, kind of like the combination you'd like, also customizable. I selected the Oreo-Rocher, since I like Oreos and Ferrero Rocher. Third, you get to select your sauce, I picked chocolate. And lastly you get to pick toppings, I asked for whipped cream, but he also added on some chocolate wafers for me. I absolutely loved the ice cream and I thought that it was so cool watching it be made. I don't know what it was about the way it was made but it was so tasty and I loved the texture, soft and gooey. I find that I will be frequenting this place. The only down fall for me was the pricing. My sister was also with me at that time and also got rolled ice cream. We paid together and our total came close to $15 dollars. Two cups and each cup being $7 dollars and some change is a bit much, but because the ice cream was great, and the service was wonderful. I believe it's worth it, and I'll still be back."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty, staff extremely friendly, the made in front of you icecream creations are delicious. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The ice cream rolls were really good and creamy. It was awkward going in though because the guy making them had headphones in the whole time so I stood there for a few minutes before he told me to write my order down on a paper. Then when I was paying he was talking to someone on his headphones and it was all just awkward. Despite the confusion and unorganized system, the ice cream lived up to its hype."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Perfect for my sweet tooth and cravings. I usually go with monkey business or craft my own with fresh fruits. There are a lot of options to choose from. A must try! Definitely better than average ice cream parlors!"}
{"text":"For being located in a mall, my friend and I were skeptical at first. However, the smell lured us in, so we figured we'd give it a shot; especially after seeing the ice cream rolls being made right in front of us. It's not the typical Indian food I'm used to from my friend's family or other places back in Orlando, but the taste of everything was wonderful. We both rather enjoyed the curry chicken combo which came with a type of naan bread, and they gave us a small sample of the ice cream rolls. Needless to say, after devouring our entire combo meals, we ended up sharing a small ice cream roll cup. They were smooth, creamy, and quite delicious. We plan on going back for more!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place so unique and so delicious!!! This ice cream rolls are so cool and such an array of toppings and mix ins to choose from!!!"}
{"text":"If I knew she was gonna milk the damn cow too I wouldn't have gotten ice cream . Waiting 20 minutes for ice cream is just a little ridiculous when homeboy is over there on his phone , not helping the girl working ?"}
{"text":"Family and I stopped in after seeing an ad on facebook for their ice cream rolls...we knew we had to try it. It was so delicious and a cool process to watch! Got a plate of their hot food too, it was also delicious! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The location is still open they just moved upstairs by pac-sun and Express inside arrowhead mall. I love Maya."}
{"text":"Leaving the mall and saw this place. The idea sounded interesting so we walked back to try it. SO GLAD WE DID! This was absolutely delicious!!! We had the Monkey Business(Nutella) with vanilla ice cream, bananas, blueberries and condensed milk. It was heaven on a spoon! The staff was very kind and helpful too! Highly recommend trying this place!"}
