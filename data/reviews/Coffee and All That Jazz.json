{"text":"This is a great place if you just so happen to be in the area or if you want to have a coffee date with friends.   The best thing this place has going for them is their overall vibe. I love their jazz and old school music. They have a good amount of seating and a lot of natural light that comes in through the windows.   Good customer service, the people working there are always very friendly. I've had their coffee and cappuccino, both really good. A little on the more expensive side if you're used to buying Tim Hortons. If you're a Starbucks kind of person, prices are about the same.   Overall there's a cool laidback vibe from this place. It's not one of my favourite places but definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be my favorite neighbourhood cafe, especially now that Alternative Grounds is gone, and I know a bunch of AG regulars have made ATJ their new hangout.  It's cozy, but there's still room to come in with a bunch of friends or to have a coffee-shop meeting; there's good treats from a number of good local bakeries including Dufflet; reliable wifi; great staff; huge windows to watch the street...  ... but the coffee is so disappointing.  Seriously, I don't know if it's old beans, or not enough grounds, or left in the pot too long, or what, but the problem with All That Jazz is the coffee. They often have four different varieties of drip coffee available, one flavoured, which is a red flag to me. The coffee world has moved on from this.  I get Americanos instead, but that's a manual pull, and so that's unreliable too. It's better than the drip, at least.  I really want them to do well here, especially with all the coffee competition that's coming up on Roncy, but it's time to at least catch up to the second wave of cafes -- doubly so now that their bean supplier, Reunion Island, is opening their own cafe down the street."}
{"text":"Single handedly the worst wifi in the city. The coffee can be ok depending on who's serving it. The space is lovely and bright. Total lack of outlets makes it hard to do work unless you have a decent computer. The furniture is falling apart and junky. But it's a pretty comfortable and relaxed place. (Why do the questions ask if it has a TV! I certainly hope not)."}
{"text":"Update:  I wish they baked their own treats... Most of it is pre-packaged or Dufflet brand.   The coffee is delicous, but a bit expensive ($2.25 for a large).  I still love the atmosphere - always very clean and lovely.   Cash only."}
{"text":"I get an apple cider here at least twice a week, one of my favorite things to do in Roncy."}
{"text":"This place has grown on me. Like Michelle A. wrote, coffee is a bit expensive, and I've had the same sized mug priced as both a small ($1.40?) and a medium ($1.95), so that's something to watch out for. What keeps me coming back is that unlike some of my usual haunts, which can get pretty crowded and cramped, this cafe is rarely packed and is quite spacious; there are two large communal tables in addition to eight or nine two-person tables, and you're not really rubbing elbows with anyone. There's free wifi, though not a ton of outlets, and big windows that let in a ton of natural light - a major selling point for me. On occasion they have live jazz (and jazz radio the rest of the time), which is kind of cool without interfering with any work one may be trying to get done. And, unlike a lot of other cafes in the area, they're open well into the evening on most days. I still prefer some of the places closer to my house, but will continue to come here when I know I need to spread out a bit."}
{"text":"Like some of the other reviewers said, this place really grew on me. I wrote it off for the first few months I lived in the area but after growing a bit tired of my usual spots, I checked it out. It was okay. Very simple, casual vibe. I ended up there a second time and happened across their hummus-avocado pita. This was a game-changer. It's a good-sized portion and although the ingredients are simple - it's unbelievably delicious. I highly recommend it, especially for $5.75. This is a great place if you want a spacious, quiet experience. I took my parents here and they loved it for those reasons. Worth checking out if you live in the neighbourhood but I wouldn't make a trip across town. Except maybe for that hummus-avocado pita."}
{"text":"(Ambiance) All That Jazz is a neighbourhood staple! The place is casual and spacious. Two rooms filled with light from the wall of windows stretching the entire length of the place make for great people watching and plenty of sunshine to sit in. The separate rooms also make for a warmer and more quiet work space at the back. The staff are friendly and fast and it's easy to feel comfortable spending the whole day in here. There are a number of small tables as well as a few larger ones to spread out or to work in a group. In the background they have a smooth jazz soundtrack which just puts you at ease and really ups my productivity. I've heard they have live music in here too but I've never seen it. They have a lack of outlets (3 or so for the whole place) but free fast Wi-Fi. They also have the best hours of any caf√© in the Roncy area; open till 9pm on weekdays and 8pm on weekends! They've been a lifesaver more than once when the power goes out in my neighbourhood.  (Fare) Their coffee is tasty and it is fair trade! Lattes have an increasing number of espresso shots with each size up. If you're looking to warm up without the caffeine I recommend the hot apple cider, it's not too sweet or spiced. They don't do any baking on site, but stock goodies from local Dufflet Bakery, and soup and sandwiches.  (Note) No longer cash only, they accept debit and credit. Yay!"}
{"text":"the yellow wall on the west corner of roncesvalles and howard park opens up to an inviting atmosphere with an inviting back room away from the barista action.. soothing mellow jazz tunes and Reunion Island coffee this joint is often missed as one walks along roncesvalles... worth the coffee although they do not bake on the premises so the selection of baked goods are not all that..."}
{"text":"I haven been here a few times over the years and although I enjoy their jazz music vibe, whether it be coming out of speakers or live(!) this is determinately one  of those Cafe's you will mostly enjoy if you are able to walk to it from your nearby home.   The decor is alright, there is plenty of uncrowded space, although a large Starbucks can easily hold more people. The price they must pay to have that creative/laid-back jazzy vibe.   I was there for a private party a few weeks ago and it felt kind of crowded as most people tend to choose either the east or west wing(rooms) to hang out but not the narrow middle where the doors to the cold outside are. For obvious reasons.   The prices are on par with a privately owned cafe that is somewhat in the middle of nowhere and is trying to make sure they pay off their rent at the end of the month. So, kind of expensive.   Would this place become a hang out place? I live downtown so... heck no. Would it be if I lived in the hood? Maybe. But if I wanted live music and a drink, there are other better suited places nearby, like The Local and Gate 403 to try."}
{"text":"The thing i enjoy most about this little cafe is simply it's ambiance. There's nothing like coming here on a chilly winter night, and sitting by the window with a hot cup of coffee in a cool looking mug!   Wi-Fi kinda sucks though....."}
{"text":"It's a coffee shop and the coffee is bad. Stale, weak, bad. Espresso drinks are weak and stale. Drip coffee is stale and weak and not even that hot. Baked goods are all factory-produced, likely cracked open from a Costco plastic box once a week.  Wifi, for YEARS, has been spotty... you're lucky if Gmail will load at all, forget about normal internet usage. They need a new router. The \"Jazz\" part of their name means they play the jazz radio station for such greats as jazz renditions of The Beatles.  The location is great, the hours are good, the decor... well, they could do it better, but if the coffee and food was in any way better, I would deal with it. As it stands, you are really better off at even the Starbucks up the street or the Timothy's down the street. Belljar's just a couple minutes walk if it's the morning. Alternative Grounds is a better bet if you just want a drip coffee.  They need to get rid of the AWFUL comic sans sign outside."}
{"text":"A nice spacious coffee shop.  Staff has always been decent, coffee very good. What else to say....."}
{"text":"Found this place just as i was driving along and decided why not some coffee and Jazz on a Saturday afternoon.  Good decision.. shared the ham and cheese on pumpernickel and a datk roasted coffee.. yummy says my belly."}
{"text":"The coffee from All that Jazz has great coffee, and that's easily what's most important for me in a cafe. I usually just get the coffee, but sometimes get the latte or cappuccino and the iced Americano in the summer. They've also started bringing in more food on the menu, some they seem to make there like sandwiches, and some they bring in from Dufflet's...I think. Inside is quite spacious with ample seating that can usually guarantee you a spot. It's also got nice big windows with lots of natural light and jazz continuously playing. It's a good spot to enjoy a coffee and a bite or just grab a cup of joe to go."}
{"text":"I totally dig this place the coffee was great and yeah there were two cool cats playing live jazz. Awesome little spot."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Its got great daylight and lots of seats and the coffee is great and a nice selection of pastries.  Some from Dufflet and some made in house.  I had the mocha latte and chocolate espresso scone.  Both very good."}
{"text":"This spot is a true gem! The staff are incredibly nice and give off a 'mom and pop' shop feel. The live jazz is beautiful and the cafe has a decent amount of seating with good-sized tables for studying. The coffee is lovely, there are plenty of food options, and there is tons of free parking in the area! I would definitely recommend this coffee shop!"}
