{"text":"Good food but I can't say it's worth the price although if you are looking for a vintage diner feel this is definitely a good plce to try"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this authentic little diner in Bloor West Village for years and it never changes.  The original staff are still here, older of course, but just as welcoming and friendly as ever.  The food is honest, unpretentious and old fashioned, unlike the rest of the trendy, overpriced establishments that seem to come and go in the area.  The clientele is about as diverse as you can get it and you can linger there for hours and drink as many refills on their delicious coffee as you want.  The all-day breakfast for $8 is homey, buttery and tasty and comes with lovely home fries and little cups of marmalade and strawberry jam.  It's also about the only place I know where you can get a regular-sized sandwich that isn't a massive baguette, Panini or wrap. Try their western sandwich with tangy fresh coleslaw and homemade soup."}
{"text":"it's funny because my experience eating at this place was quite different than those previous reviewers, though my enjoyment was just the same.   I ate here right around closing time (4pm) today, Monday and my friend and I were the last to be served before they closed up and also the only two in there. Though it was enjoyable and everything one should expect from a greasy spoon I somehow feel like my experience could have been more authentic.   I am not a local (of Bloor West anyways) but after walking around in the neighbourhood for a bit this afternoon I can see how this place is an oasis amidst a sea of strollers and the self important.   In conclusion: If you are pushing a stroller and/or are self important than this is not the place for you. If you are anyone else than head on in!"}
{"text":"Ah, last of the greasy spoons... well, at least along this stretch of Bloor.  It's true that the old-school, working-class diner is a dying breed, especially in neighbourhoods that have been or are becoming gentrified (look at the places on Roncesvalles to see this process in action).  That's why Bloor-Jane Restaurant, with its crappy sign--go Leafs go!--and artery-clogging food is a bit out of place in Bloor West Village, but also why I'm glad it's still there. They even have an enormous cash register that's reminiscent of an Enigma machine, and is likely just as old."}
{"text":"I agree with all the good reviews. Wife and I are always glad we stopped here rather than the rest in BWV. Food Good. Sharp waitress. Reminds me of my youth in Detroit many decades ago. Could use a coat of paint but no biggie. Bring cash."}
{"text":"The Bloor-Jane Restaurant was a bit of a random find while out doing a few Bloor West-specific errands...on an empty stomach midway through a Saturday afternoon. Thanks to the wonders of iPhone apps, we learned about the place and headed over to check it out.  Within about a second of walking through the front door, even before getting a seat at a booth, the waitress asked whether we wanted coffee....we opted for tea, and settled in to check out the menu and to admire the old-school diner ambiance. (Toronto Maple Leaf flags everywhere, newspaper articles, photographs, the works; this place has been around for over 25 years and it obviously an important part of the 'hood.)  Brunch was great. I had a veggie omelette with rye toast, and my trusty sidekick had scrambled eggs, sausage, and rye toast. Both meals came with fried potatoes. Oh -- and the condiments are definitely worth mentioning: in addition to Heinz ketchup, you'll find HP sauce, Frank's Red Hot sauce, Tabasco (red), and malt vinegar (eek - I think). That's a mighty fine line up.  A few other reviewers have noted that this place is a greasy spoon, and perhaps in a literal sense it is for other dishes, but there was a clear lack of grease with both of our meals. Non-greasy greasy spoons are good finds, especially when they're run by Greek families, as this place is. Greek diners are the gold standard....and they're unfortunately few and far between these days."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to other Yelpers!  If you want casual, home style cooking with a friendly, laid back feel, this is the place!  Food is fast, tasty and won't cost you loads of cash. Absolutely recommend eating here!!"}
{"text":"Love it. There is nothing better than sleeping in on a Saturday morning then wadnering down to the Bloor-Jane. This is the quintessential greasy spoon diner. Service is greasy diner great. Food is basic fare but always as good as you could hope for. And once you've been there a couple times John and Maria will probably remember your name and maybe even remember your order!"}
{"text":"An authentic greasy spoon bfast! Amazingly attentive & friendly staff... The decor, layout  & cash register makes you feel like you're back in the 50's or 60's- I'm sure a lot of their furnishings and decor is the original. I enjoyed sitting at the bar chatting with the waitress watching the 2 older cooks preparing all the food on the grills. Very speedy service and tasty, good quality greasy spoon food - Good vibes :)"}
{"text":"Classic greasy spoon diner with outstanding service. Even though we moved out of the area my wife and I still get there about twice a month. It's not a place to lounge over brunch - if you encounter a line don't fret - it'll move quick. Cash only.   In summary: great breakfast and great staff at a good price. The place is just so darn cute."}
{"text":"One of my favourite greasy-spoon breakfast places in Toronto.  Very relaxed setting, with warm consistent service from familiar faces."}
{"text":"Excellent, good old-fashioned breakfast at reasonable prices. You can get stuffed for 10 bucks."}
{"text":"I love a good, honest greasy spoon, honest in that it is honest down home family cooking... My buddy liked her breakfast special and the service was good, however, the visit here proved pretty awful for myself, ordered the fish and chips, which came pretty cold with a single deep fried 2\" x 4\" FROZEN patty, a handful of deep fried FROZEN fries and a single serving of PACKAGED tartar sauce and oily unseasoned (no salt, pepper, or vinegar) cabbage that was their take on coleslaw, all for $9.50, the price of an authentic fish n chips anywhere else.  We should have waited to get into Good Fork and dished out extra $$. Go for the greasy breakfast, nothing else, is my suggestion."}
{"text":"We came here because the brunch place next door had an hour wait and this place, while busy, didn't have much of a line up. In retrospect, I wish we waited the hour at the other place. Ordered the $8 breakfast special with sausage, poached eggs and potatoes. This place is certainly a greasy spoon, but that's all that it was - greasy. The sausages lacked any kind of real meat content, it was mostly a combination of fat and who knows what. The potatoes lacked taste too, seemed like they boiled it, poorly seasoned and fried it for 2 seconds. I ordered a hot chocolate which was made with Tim Horton's powdered hot chocolate. I could have made this breakfast myself at home."}
{"text":"Breakfast was ok however was ignored by the one server for almost 15 minutes!! We would of left but we were hungry for breakfast & no one served it close by at 1pm ....   The server had served customers that walked in after us. And although her excuse was she was away in the washroom... the other employees / cook saw us enter & sat down waiting - could of mentioned us!! Yes it was quite busy, however if other customers walked in after us, we're being served, why were we ignored - when clearly they saw us walk in?   The place looks run down.. Like it can use renovations.. And the server is one Greek lady who seems abit rude & expects you to understand   Will not share business with them again."}
{"text":"Cheap, cheerful and delicious!  Came here for a Sunday brunch with a girlfriend. We both had the steak and eggs. They came with potatoes, we didn't want toast, but we did have pickles. Great endless coffee, but the most important part: the food was DELICIOUS. Great steak, great eggs (I like mine runny and they were PERFECTLY runny). Sharp waitress. Nice dill pickles. Amazing value (between $-$$ per person, depending if you're getting the basic egg dishes or the eggs & steak dish), delicious food, we're fans."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of greasy spoons, but when I walked in here this morning, around 9:30 with friends in tow, there was something different about the vibe.  It was very comfortable and welcoming.  The waitress was very friendly, without being too familiar, and the service was lightening fast.  My veggie omelet and home fries were very good, and the coffee is just above average diner fare.  Saving the best for last, the chocolate milk shake (how could I resist) was delicious and authentic.  They even bring you the aluminum container with the leftover shake.  I'll be back...I bet their grilled cheese and fries are great!"}
{"text":"An Excellent \"Greasy Spoon\" and/or Lunch Counter.   The staff is friendly, and recognize just about everyone that walks through the door.   I go there often for Breakfast (even when it's lunchtime).   The food is consistent, well priced, and plentiful."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and unassuming. Family owned and run restaurant, home-cooked and simple meals and an endless flow of coffee. We went for Saturday brunch; were seated right away and presented with menu. My veggie omelette was accompanied with potatoes and bread. It was more of an open omelette, and really delicious (see photo). They cook everything with butter, so be warned if you are lactose intolerant. The place can get packed quickly, so on busy days there may be lines/waiting. I would go back on a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Portions sizes are good and they look after you. This is a treat I sometimes take advantage of. I would recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is one of the last few to hold the forth in a food community that ceaselessly stack one fancy spot after another.   Don't let the view foolish you: what you see from the street is what you'll get once you'll walk through the door. This is an untouched diner from the past that probably has its paint that thanks to its age, could probably change its colour according to the weather.   But again, don't let the appearance fool you.   The service is prompt and courteous and comes without mistakes even if you customize the standard choice and ask for lots of extras.  Everything we order, one reg breakfast special with the choice of bacon and one with a bit of the three meats (bacon, sausage and ham) is cooked to perfection, in particular the bacon that won't be greasy and soggy and the house potatoes that aren't either undercooked nor that break apart.   Price is fair: only $8.50 tax included   What more can I say? Come for brunch and judge by yourself."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been here often over the years. Best breakfast and fast service definitely. For a while I was going fairly regularly. I stopped for this reason - the one waitress who is usually surly (although she has improved in her attitude) told me I couldn't delay as they were busy. This was because I was alone and I always take a book when eating alone. This does not mean I am going to linger after I have eaten, I have no interest in doing so. I was in and out within 20mins. and always wished I'd said to her \"was that fast enough for you?\" The irony was that the place had several empty booths when I left. I was extremely resentful of being treated that way just because I was alone; and resisted going back for a very long time because of it.  I finally gave in and have visited a few times since. While this particular waitress has improved in attitude, she will still place me at a tiny \"half-table\" in the back corner because I'm alone; I would be willing to bet if I had someone with me that would not happen even though the table could fit two.  My 4 stars in fairness is for the food. Definitely a step up from Sunset Grill as one reviewer stated (who serve good food, but far too much of it)."}
{"text":"Sunset grill, is cheaper and has bigger portions. I used to go to this place all the time, didn't go for 4 years as I went away for university and I'd have to say that it truly isn't as great as it used to be. Don't get me wrong though, the service is quick and great. I also thought the home fries which came with my omelette really were tasteless. Quick place for breakfast but for something a lot better just pay the extra few dollars."}
{"text":"so we wanted to go next door to this brunch place but unfortunately there was an hour wait and we just couldn't do it!  so we decided to go to this place...we thought...okay, this place is quite busy..can't be all that bad.  let's just say i bet that most, if not all of these people were because next door was packed and they couldn't wait.  we ordered a breakfast special each with choice of eggs, choice of meat (sausage, bacon), and potatoes.  special came with a coffee too - free refills.  every thing was super super greasy...as the first meal of the day it was hard to stomach.  i got the over easy eggs which was done right (their one star).  but the sausage was just so fatty and didn't taste like any meat...just fat.  potatoes weren't great either...mushy on the outside...had to put lots of ketchup.  definitely should have waited the hour for next door's brunch.   don't waste your $8+tax+tip on this place.  either wait by walking around the area or go back home for breakfast."}
{"text":"4* is a little generous but the old time feeling of this greasy spoon is just something else. Feels like it hasn't had a paint job or any renovations in the 30-odd years it's been here and it's probably had the same staff too. Waitress is really nice and attentive in a direct way. \"Want a cawwwfee?\" She half screamed across the restaurant on my first visit. Love it.   And bacon,  eggs,  home fries, toast,  and coffee for $8,  including tax ain't bad."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised that I have not yet reviewed Bloor Jane Restaurant; I know I have been there at least 3 times this winter to have a quick breakfast before going ice-skating in the west-end. It's a true old-fashioned greasy-spoon diner, with a long eating counter right in front of the cooking area, about a dozen booths and tables, and lots of hockey and other sports' photos on the walls. There is a small stereo at the end of the counter, but the TV is usually tuned into CP24 in the mornings instead of any music.  There are always a lot of regular customers being greeted by name as they come in. The service is FAST!! By the time I have my coat off, someone is asking if I want coffee or tea, and my breakfast is ready in about 3min, with a coffee refill shortly afterwards.  They have a full menu of breakfasts and sandwiches, etc, but I have always had one of the breakfast specials - usually the eggs, bacon or sausage, home fries, coffee. I have also had the french toast special, but not the pancakes. There's nothing extravagant here, just a basic solid breakfast like I would make at home. Even the food is like at my home: the jam comes out of a jar into paper cups, the butter sliced off a 1-lb block, the milk is in cartons, and they even have all the old-fashioned condiments like HP Sauce and Worcester Sauce and Heinz 57. The breakfast specials have recently increased from $8.50 to $9.00 (cash only I believe), but this includes coffee and taxes, so still a good deal. Definitely a recommendation if you're looking for a quick home-made breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here because place next door had a long wait - best decision ever! Has a nice cozy mom and pop diner feel.. I thought service was really good.. one lady (assuming the owner) serves all tables and memorizes everyones order! we got the $8 breakfast special and the $12 steak breakfast.. all prices are tax included.. It was very yummy and coffee was good :) will come back again!! Thanks :)"}
{"text":"A total greasy spoon, which, generally, I love going to.   I've lived in BWV for almost 10 years and for whatever reason, today was the first time I've been. My girlfriend and I brought our 2 young kids in, which, could have contributed to our so-so experience.   The food - great! Who doesn't love bacon, eggs and toast greasy spoon style?   The service - So-so. We had to ask twice for our coffee, which was required fuel for my friend and I.  But our food came in less than 5 mins, which was great!   Atmosphere - total greasy spoon, complete with Hockey, Soccer and other sports tchochkies. We think, however, there was some questionable \"grease\" that was in the corner wall of our table. Nothing a little Lysol can get rid of.  Price - reasonable for the amount and taste of food, plus the area of BWV.   Overall, a good experience - if I ever do go back, it will be sans small kids."}
{"text":"The best 'greasy-spoon' breakfast in BWV. It blows away Sunset Grill.  Not healthy eating, but good diner breakfast (never been for lunch)"}
{"text":"Excellent old style diner. I have been going here since I was a kid. Inexpensive, fast, courteous and delicious. One of Toronto's gems."}
{"text":"I really like diners and those one fits the bill. First time just fit some Western sandwiches to go and they were greasy but delicious.  Second time there just fit the special which is your standard eggs and meat.  This place isn't anything special but it does breakfast, home style and quick.  I'd feel a bit better if they were slightly cheaper , it wasn't expensive, just often I find these home style diners tend to provide better value and I think it could just a little more."}
{"text":"When you're out and about in Bloor West Village, you'll typically be run over by someone with a dog, riding a bike, or pushing a baby stroller.  You'll find congestion outside of the posh boutiques, dessert places, or other Yuppie hangs that truly make you feel like an outsider when you realize that you don't have a Starbucks coffee in your hand, holding your wailing infant, or stooping to pick up the droppings from your Bernese Mountain Dog.  An oasis from this surrounding comes in the form of the Bloor Jane Restaurant.  This is one of the greasiest of greasiest of spoons in the city, and to find it in this neighbourhood is a coup.  It's fast, cheap, and simple food at its best.  Open for breakfast and lunches, The Bloor Jane Restaurant gets you in, fed, and out.  A family run business, typically the wife will take your order and then yell it at her husband who cooks it for you.  Fantastic.  Eggs, bacon, and sausage come flying off the grill with great velocity.  All this for a breakfast that is south of five bucks in total.  I know I'm not alone in my love of this place.  Like-minded individuals line up every weekend vying for a spot inside to partake in mom-and-pop splendour that is the Bloor Jane.  Were I you I'd not be too fussy when ordering.  They don't suffer fools gladly.  Probably why the yuppie quotient is low."}
{"text":"Really really friendly staff and great price for a satisfying breakfast. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"We came here for a Sunday brunch as suggested by my boyfriend ( his dad used to bring him here all the time). This place is a popular brunch spot (as the reviews suggest), and as expected it was crowded and loud.It looks like a typical north american diner but it is definitely worn down over the years. Also, all the customers who probably don't get a spot in good fork brunch place just drift to this place ( Good fork is the brunch place just next door). I thought it was a fun spot and the food was pretty decent.  I ordered their special sandwiches and it was filling and flavourful. Would I like it better if the service was a bit more friendlier? YES My boyfriend described it as \"tough love\"and I couldn't agree more. The Greek waitress could come across as rude but I guess it's a family run business and she is stressed out. But when the customers started dwindling down, she also became a bit more relaxed and friendlier. Honestly, it was like going to my aunt's place for brunch where all the cousins had crowded her place. She wants to give you good food but she is also finding it hard to manage the chaos alone.  Still its a fairly decent spot for Sunday brunch, and i can see why my boyfriend's dad took them there often. I would love to go back again."}
{"text":"In writing this review, I have decided I will not make a call on whether the Bloor-Jane Restaurant is a diner or a dive.  It is a quirky mish mash of styles and cliental - exactly what I expected.  The staff welcomed everyone with open arms.  The food was fast, inexpensive and honest.  For what the restaurant represents, it's a 4.  100% greasy spoon all the way."}
{"text":"Cheap and Cheerful!  This place is indeed a rarity - a tribute to a time gone by.  It meets all my criteria for the perfect breakfast place - fast service, portions that aren't too massive (best bacon in the city incidentally), cheap and low key atmosphere.  Alot of places over the years (to the west, \"The Grille\" and \"Sizzling Jaks\") have gone more upmarket and converted their diners into environments that are more inviting - unfortunately, they've also become too busy and the prices have crept up. I've been going to this place for years and only recently have the owners had to increase the price of the basic breakfast to $7 from $5.  It gets 5 stars because it is true to its roots - it doesn't pretend to be anything but an old style family run diner.  Furthermore, it opens damn early (usually around 5am) and is disguise friendly i.e. if you are normally seen about town suited and booted, no problem coming here as your alter ego i.e. the unshaven, baseball cap wearing, greasy spoon breakfast lover.  No other place has such an eclectic mix of customers - try going at 6am and just taking your time to read the paper and chill for a few - you'll see the bay street suits, construction workers, older couples, families, guys who can't sleep, moms who are networking and the occasional scary guy pass through - and its all good..."}
{"text":"Growing up in this neighbourhood has left me with a certain nostalgia for places like this that have been here for as long as I can remember. Likely 3 stars but the warm memories bump it up to 4. My staple here is a fried egg sandwich after a medical visit across the street. Kind of a breakfast treat right after \"look Ma, no cavities!\"  It is a diner. A good diner. Not a fancy diner but one full of history and regulars and good diner food.   Maria and John will make sure you get great Colombian coffee in cups that keep your black gold nice and hot. And they will bring your order to you as soon as you decide how you want to reminisce. And it will always be exactly as promised.   For the proper experience sit at the bar. And if you are wondering.  Coffee and a fried egg sandwich will set you back a whopping $5. Also. If you are a maple leaf fan then you will be right at home."}
{"text":"Real deal diner.  Good greasy breakfast.  Solid coffee.  Leaf parafinali all over.  Aces."}
{"text":"Oooold school greasy spoon (emphasis on the greasy) and with every cliché therein you'd be after. Disturbingly fast service, your meal is more butter than food, and you'll need a nap after your breakfast. Not as cheap as these joints used to be, but this place is an institution."}
{"text":"The Bloor-Jane Restaurant is a no nonsense kind of diner.    If you come here for breakfast, you won't find organic juices, bone marrow on toast or quail eggs.  What you will find is a traditional bacon/sausage, eggs any way with hash browns and toast breakfast with bottomless coffee for $7.50 (including tax).  Service is always quick and you can get in and out within a half hour if you're in a rush.  A great staple to the BWV area."}
{"text":"Total greasy spoon, a bit grungy and the service is both friendly and gruff. I tried the club sandwich, which was really more bread than anything else, but my my, was it ever buttery and mayo-ey and artery clogging. Mmm mmmm. I had an amazing chocolate milkshake, served with a full glass and a cold, silver blending vessel filled with extra milkshake. Two milkshakes for the price of one!  Heaven is a good diner milkshake."}
{"text":"Breakfast was cheap.  I wasn't super impressed...but it wasnt the worst either."}
{"text":"A time capsule place. Which is a good thing in this age of MONOCULTURE ! Friendly staff, casual and authentic diner environment, very good breakfast food. Leafs stuff everywhere. Don't change a thing."}
{"text":"We came here because there was a half hour wait at the Good Fork next door, and boy am I ever glad we did!  It is nothing fancy, but this is the quintessential Canadian diner- decades of Maple Leafs memorabilia, decent prices and hefty portions.  I ordered a corned beef breakfast and it came with a generous helping of corned beef, two eggs, amazing home fries and some toast.  I also love the legitimately retro decor and super quick service (I think we got our meal in 5 mins).  Brunch for the two of us came up to $24 (fresh squeezed orange juice, too!). I didn't know places like this still existed!"}
{"text":"Very good bang for your buck. Generous portions and super friendly service. don't expect anything fancy, this is a mom and pop diner. Your average greasy spoon. But for a $7-8 brunch, it's delicious."}
